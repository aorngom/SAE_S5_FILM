1
00:00:01,704 --> 00:00:02,966
<i>It was an ordinary day.</i>

2
00:00:03,256 --> 00:00:05,807
<i>There were nine of us,
most of us strangers.</i>

3
00:00:06,015 --> 00:00:07,367
<i>We were all in the bank...</i>

4
00:00:07,743 --> 00:00:08,975
<i>Let's do this thing.</i>

5
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:10,554
<i>All for different reasons.</i>

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,086
<i>-And then...
- Now.</i>

7
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:15,087
<i>In an instant,
our lives changed.</i>

8
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:17,121
<i>This will all be over
in five minutes.</i>

9
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,494
<i>52 hours later,
we came out of there</i>

10
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:20,790
<i>no longer strangers.</i>

11
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:23,763
<i>- District attorney Ed Nielson.
- We're gonna nail these bastards.</i>

12
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:25,446
<i>They're never gonna see
the light of day again.</i>

13
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:28,717
<i>The only way to stop Randall Reese was
to kill him, and Lucas couldn't do that.</i>

14
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:31,191
<i>- Why is that?
- Randall is Lucas' older brother.</i>

15
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:34,192
<i>- Bonded forever by what we went through.
- Eva's dead.</i>

16
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:38,082
<i>Nick, everything would've gone down
a lot worse if you hadn't been there.</i>

17
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,350
<i>You're fired, Egan.</i>

18
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:41,282
<i>I want kids.</i>

19
00:00:41,497 --> 00:00:44,513
<i>- You know we can't, Egan.
- I've got a second chance at life.</i>

20
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,851
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

21
00:00:46,118 --> 00:00:50,673
<i>- Is this what you wanted
to tell me before the bank?
- I'm sorry about Lizzie.</i>

22
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,230
<i>I know I really screwed
things up for you guys.</i>

23
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:54,752
<i>I wish Randall was dead.</i>

24
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:58,001
<i>Randall Reese had a major
heart attack last night.</i>

25
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,952
<i>- Is he dead?
- No, they revived him.</i>

26
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:01,322
<i>What happened in there?</i>

27
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:05,380
<i>- I just wanted him out of my I.C.U., Nick.
- If he dies, I can't bury this.</i>

28
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:13,993
Hour 1 - 3:16 PM

29
00:01:17,897 --> 00:01:19,983
Let's go. Come on!

30
00:01:20,276 --> 00:01:23,421
Keep your pants on, you little girl.
I got all the vault money.

31
00:01:23,555 --> 00:01:26,601
It was more than we expected.
Now let's just get out of here.

32
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:42,892
Randall, the cops! Come on!

33
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:43,910
Your brother took a
turn for the worse.

34
00:03:46,857 --> 00:03:49,201
You told me yesterday his
chances were improving.

35
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:50,480
Well, that was yesterday.

36
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:53,231
Today he needs a
liver transplant.

37
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:55,782
He's gonna die in a couple
of days without it.

38
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:58,692
The hospital is gonna
want to speak with you.

39
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:00,253
Why me?

40
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:03,690
Well, there's a couple of
different ways to do a transplant.

41
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:05,813
They can get a liver
off a donor list,

42
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:07,623
or they can go to
a family member,

43
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:09,242
a living donor.

44
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:11,133
And what does
Randall want to do?

45
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:13,532
Well, nobody's really had a
chance to talk to him yet.

46
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:17,360
Last I heard, he's pulling cords out of
his life support like a wild animal.

47
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:21,070
- And you're suggesting
that I be the living donor?
- Absolutely not.

48
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:24,590
The only thing worse than randall
dying would be if you saved him.

49
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:27,132
Even I won't be able to
explain that to a jury.

50
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:29,881
So you're getting to me
before the hospital does.

51
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:34,723
Look, I know he's your brother,

52
00:04:34,936 --> 00:04:36,932
but you can't do this, Lucas.

53
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:38,691
I told you before,

54
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:40,453
I'm done with him.

55
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:47,893
- You gonna pull that trigger, boy?
- I don't know what
you want me to say, Lizzie.

56
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:49,533
That's all I know right now.

57
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:58,211
You all right?

58
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:02,642
Randall needs a new liver,
and he's being noncompliant.

59
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:03,880
And?

60
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,213
- And I need to face him.
- Why?

61
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:09,431
Because if he dies, and I never
get to look him in the eye,

62
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:12,112
- all I'll be left with is what he did.
- Lizzie...

63
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:16,350
Last week, you were so freaked out by
him that you ran out of the I.C.U.

64
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:18,153
and then you almost miscarried.

65
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:21,713
- Now you want to be
in a room with him?
- I'm angry.

66
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:24,062
I thought I was doing okay,
but I...

67
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:26,052
I don't want all this anger.

68
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:31,812
So he comes up behind the husband,
smashes him in the head.

69
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:34,381
The wife hears from the next room.
She comes in to see what's happening.

70
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,831
He takes her out, too.

71
00:05:36,055 --> 00:05:37,880
- Murder weapon?
- An iron.

72
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:40,572
Scald marks on the body
say it was still hot.

73
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:42,520
But what I really need
is time of death.

74
00:05:42,557 --> 00:05:44,221
- I'll see what I can do.
- Hey, Nick.

75
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:47,822
Neighbors heard the son in some
knock-down, drag-outs with mom and
pop yesterday

76
00:05:47,857 --> 00:05:49,802
- and early this morning.
- About what?

77
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:51,622
From what I hear,
they really nagged on the guy.

78
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:53,752
I guess they were both sick,
needed a lot of attention.

79
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:54,782
Where is he?

80
00:05:55,076 --> 00:05:56,540
Trying to get a
bead on him now.

81
00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:57,531
Cavanaugh.

82
00:05:57,596 --> 00:05:59,171
It's Jeremy.

83
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:05,040
That patient you were
interested in may not make it.

84
00:06:05,328 --> 00:06:08,853
- Complications related to last week.
- I thought you said he was stabilizing.

85
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:09,922
He was.

86
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:12,471
Do I need a lawyer?

87
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:14,251
No, I think it's covered.

88
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:17,341
- I thought you said if he dies...
- That was last week.

89
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:19,941
Everybody's moved on
to bigger and better.

90
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,490
- You don't sound so sure.
- Just...

91
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:25,432
Don't do anything right now.

92
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:28,850
I'll get back to you if
there's a problem, okay?

93
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:29,962
Okay.

94
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:39,223
I'm sorry about earlier.

95
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:42,172
Will you please
stop apologizing?

96
00:06:42,457 --> 00:06:43,711
We'll get there
when you're ready.

97
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:45,602
Yeah, well,
I'm ready to be ready.

98
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:48,493
And beating yourself up
about it's gonna help, hmm?

99
00:06:49,527 --> 00:06:50,741
Come here.

100
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:54,490
I was thinking...

101
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:57,801
We should get away
next weekend.

102
00:06:58,025 --> 00:06:59,150
Post ranch, maybe?

103
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:02,670
Or San Ysidro if we don't
want to drive that far. Hmm?

104
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:05,743
You think Santa Barbara's
overrated and white-bread.

105
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:07,362
Yeah, but you love it.

106
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,040
And that, as they say,
is all that matters.

107
00:07:14,455 --> 00:07:15,822
Are you in a trance?

108
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:22,303
No, I was just
thinking about Gene.

109
00:07:24,137 --> 00:07:25,261
You know, we're

110
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:27,472
taking him out for his
bachelor party tonight?

111
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:29,140
Yeah, don't remind me.

112
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:32,623
He's happy, Mary...

113
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:36,342
In love again.

114
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:43,561
We're not happy... Mary.

115
00:07:47,015 --> 00:07:48,142
Egan...

116
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:51,752
Egan, I... I know you're going
through some changes right now.

117
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:53,481
- No, no, that's not it.
- Yes, it is.

118
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:55,733
You've been on this
crazy rush of adrenaline

119
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:59,070
- ever since you got out of there. It's...
- It's not a rush.

120
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,390
Mary, I want you to
look me in the eye,

121
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:05,623
tell me the last
time we were happy.

122
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:09,550
Tell me the last time that y felt your
life was what you wanted it to be.

123
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:21,140
I'm getting a little tired
of you avoiding me, Franny.

124
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:23,532
I know how much money you
got from that fund on tv,

125
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,223
and I need the $10,000.

126
00:08:25,497 --> 00:08:27,993
I'm the kid's father,
Franny, his father.

127
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:31,813
Hey, there.

128
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:33,203
Hey, how's it going?

129
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:34,910
It's fine. What's up?

130
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:36,921
Are you gonna be at
the diner later?

131
00:08:36,955 --> 00:08:40,133
Uh, I hadn't thought about it.
I guess. Why?

132
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:43,221
I need to talk to you about Carlos,
Eva's ex.

133
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:44,712
Why? What's going on?

134
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:47,081
- He's kind of harassing me.
- From prison?

135
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:49,850
Well, he keeps calling me
saying that he needs money

136
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:52,153
and threatening to take custody
of Ricky if I don't pay him.

137
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:53,381
Did you talk to Kathryn?

138
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:55,353
No, not yet.

139
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,660
I thought we talked
about this last week.

140
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:02,820
You know what, I gotta go.

141
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:06,101
Um... I'll see you at the diner.
We'll talk then.

142
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:11,341
Hey, Mario.

143
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:15,070
You know that thing we
talked about last week?

144
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:16,163
Yeah.

145
00:09:16,464 --> 00:09:17,666
We still okay with that?

146
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:20,197
You asked for a favor.
I did you a favor.

147
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:24,402
- And if the patient's condition changes?
- My ass is way on the line here.

148
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,990
I... I'm certainly not gonna
double back and change my report.

149
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:42,171
Everybody get behind the counter.
Now. Go!

150
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:44,023
- Why don't we just go now?
- Because if there's a shoot-out,

151
00:09:44,055 --> 00:09:45,411
we don't wanna run towards it

152
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:46,981
or be near those windows.
Now go!

153
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:49,131
- But there's a backdoor
right down this way.
- There's no time to argue.

154
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:51,053
Everybody shut up
and do as I say.

155
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,731
Can I talk to you a minute?

156
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:58,323
Let me guess. Randall Reese?

157
00:09:58,546 --> 00:09:59,920
Yeah. Um...

158
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,781
I'm sure this is gonna sound strange,
but I'd like to see him.

159
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:05,422
You know I can't do that.

160
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,753
Will you ask him?

161
00:10:10,907 --> 00:10:12,081
Please.

162
00:10:12,788 --> 00:10:14,601
Don't make me explain why.

163
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,313
You gonna pull
that trigger, boy?

164
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,171
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:45,132
What?

166
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,770
He won't see you.

167
00:10:46,997 --> 00:10:48,523
Lizzie, please...

168
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:52,072
I suggest you get
back to work, huh?

169
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:13,152

00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:27,630
10 grand? What does he need
that kind of money for?

171
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:29,683
He says the gangs in prison
have a price on his head.

172
00:11:29,715 --> 00:11:31,863
- Well, do you believe him?
- I don't know.

173
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,841
I don't want Ricky to become an
orphan even if his father is a loser.

174
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,772
Well, you shouldn't touch
the money from the fund,

175
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:38,320
and you shouldn't be
sending it to jail.

176
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:40,460
If he ends up using that to buy and
sell drugs, you'd be implicated.

177
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:41,903
So what do you
think I should do?

178
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:43,190
Let me look into it.

179
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:47,673
If Carlos is really worried about his
safety, then maybe there's something I
can do.

180
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:49,702
When did this happen?

181
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:53,593
Technically this morning, but you could
say it's been happening for ten years.

182
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,603
Wow, Egan. I'm sorry.

183
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:55,762
No, it's for the best.

184
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:57,751
- It, uh...
- What is?

185
00:11:58,147 --> 00:11:59,320
I left Mary.

186
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:02,101
Oh.

187
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:06,833
So, my fellow divorcé,
any pearls of wisdom for me?

188
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,460
Get a good lawyer.

189
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:10,303
No, no, no. I'm, uh,

190
00:12:10,548 --> 00:12:13,143
- I'm giving her just
about everything, so...
- Everything?

191
00:12:13,178 --> 00:12:16,500
You know, the house,
the furniture, the pinto.

192
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,950
Well, if you, uh, need a place
to crash for a little while,

193
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:21,082
we got plenty of room.

194
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:23,022
Oh. Well, thank you.

195
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:26,323
But, no, I'm checking in to the
singleton over on Alameda. I'm sure
it'll be...

196
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:27,641
It'll be fine.

197
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,240
I'm so sorry.
I got hung up with a patient.

198
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:31,830
There's an accident on the 101.

199
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,213
- I'm really sorry.
- No, it's okay.

200
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:34,650
It's fine. We're still waiting
for a table anyway.

201
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
Okay, good. That's good.

202
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:38,802
I'll look into it on my end,
but maybe you can check in with her.

203
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:40,081
She seems kinda jittery.

204
00:12:40,796 --> 00:12:42,023
Looks all right to me.

205
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:43,873
Well, you know,
she's got a good cover.

206
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:46,450
Who knows what kind of friends
this Carlos has on the outside?

207
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:48,030
Maybe you could look into that.

208
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:51,171
Um, ironically,

209
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:54,301
I am the unofficial host of
a bachelor party tonight.

210
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:57,213
My friend Gene...
His, uh, second go-around.

211
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:00,553
Anyway, it's only three of us,
which is sort of a motley crew.

212
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:03,292
Can I, uh, tempt any of you
able-bodied gentlemen?

213
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:06,260
Oh, my bachelor party days
are long gone, my friend.

214
00:13:06,337 --> 00:13:07,540
I gotta work.

215
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:10,061
Dr. J.,
I bet you're a hell of a wingman.

216
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,200
Come on,
apple martinis at Lola's.

217
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:15,762
- It's gonna be hot.
- Oh, you cannot do
a bachelor party at Lola's.

218
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:17,851
Come to Trendy.
I'll swing you a round of free drinks,

219
00:13:17,886 --> 00:13:20,260
- get you into the V.I.P. area.
- Very fancy.

220
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:24,993
We, I actually happen to start
working there tonight, cocktailing.

221
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:27,102
What happened with
the employment agency?

222
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:28,852
Well, there was
nothing there for me.

223
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:30,811
Besides, this is gonna
be much more fun,

224
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:34,140
and I'll actually make more money
than I would at some office job.

225
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:35,413
You in?

226
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:40,203
Yeah, sure. I'm in.

227
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:42,941
- I tried to see Randall today.
- What?

228
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:44,622
He wouldn't see me.

229
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:48,143
I asked the nurse to tell
him I wanted to talk to him,

230
00:13:48,268 --> 00:13:50,980
and he refused to let me in.

231
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,712
What were you trying to do?

232
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:54,983
I don't know. I just...

233
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:57,452
He's gonna die.

234
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,182
And I have all these feelings,

235
00:14:00,468 --> 00:14:04,533
and I just thought that we were
gonna get the chance to face him...

236
00:14:04,817 --> 00:14:07,273
in court,
in front of the world...

237
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:11,483
and now it's like he knows that, like
he's letting himself die to punish us.

238
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,771
I think death is too
good for that bastard.

239
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:16,143
I was looking forward to
seeing him squirm in court,

240
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:17,873
rot in jail for
the next 50 years.

241
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:19,531
Nothing we can do
about it anyway.

242
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:20,873
So shouldn't we just try to,

243
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:22,053
you know, look forward?

244
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:23,290
Amen to that.

245
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:25,530
Well, that's not exactly true.

246
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,223
What?

247
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:30,171
That there's
nothing to be done.

248
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:34,391
Most of the time, when a...
a patient is noncompliant,

249
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:36,653
they can be turned
around, right?

250
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:40,292
Usually, they're just acting
out to get attention.

251
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:42,261
But who knows with him?

252
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:45,152
- What if he could be swayed?
- What are we doing here?

253
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:47,883
Well, would we prefer that
he live and face the music,

254
00:14:48,147 --> 00:14:50,191
or float away high as
a kite on morphine?

255
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,242
I for one would like to
see him suffer some more,

256
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:54,940
and we all know the thing that he
fears the most is going back to jail.

257
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,702
Well, I'd like to see him off
the planet as soon as possible.

258
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:57,861
I agree with Nick.

259
00:14:58,227 --> 00:15:00,002
If he dies tomorrow,
throw a party, move on.

260
00:15:00,037 --> 00:15:01,432
But what about Lucas?

261
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:04,583
- He shouldn't have to
stand trial by himself.
- No, he shouldn't.

262
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:07,072
Lucas made his bed when he
brought that psychopath in there.

263
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:09,501
I don't even know what
we're talking about here.

264
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:11,352
This is out of our hands.

265
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,753
It's god's will now.

266
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:15,663
God's will?

267
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,802
You think what happened to
us in there is god's will?

268
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:22,493
I mean, I think if we have a chance,
we have to try.

269
00:15:22,737 --> 00:15:25,900
For Eva... I mean,
he should have to answer for her.

270
00:15:26,145 --> 00:15:28,543
Look, guys, I gotta say,

271
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:31,812
if you think you're gonna get some
kind of satisfaction out of this,

272
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:33,261
some kind of closure,

273
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:36,381
you're not. I've seen it.

274
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:39,151
It's just gonna drag the whole
thing out, and in the end,

275
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,603
you're gonna wish he'd died and the
whole thing had already been over.

276
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:43,830
Randall dying isn't
gonna make this over.

277
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:47,660
And I've seen a lot of people get
something out of seeing justice done.

278
00:15:54,675 --> 00:15:58,080
Well, you've heard my position.

279
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:02,512
You, uh,
do whatever you have to do.

280
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:04,361
I gotta get back to work.

281
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:18,883
So what do we want to do?

282
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:31,492
I was hoping you'd come.

283
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:33,300
I wanted to.

284
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:34,972
How are you feeling?

285
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,392
Is everything all right?

286
00:16:36,686 --> 00:16:39,473
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.

287
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:42,680
Did you tell Jeremy yet?

288
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,982
Yeah. Finally.

289
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:47,431
And how was that?

290
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:51,602
I'm not sure I want
to talk about this.

291
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:53,363
Oh.

292
00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:55,463
I'm sorry.

293
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:58,863
- I need... to...
- What?

294
00:17:00,516 --> 00:17:02,263
We need your help.

295
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:04,992
"We"?

296
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,340
The group.

297
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:09,642
With what?

298
00:17:10,316 --> 00:17:11,660
You heard about Randall?

299
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:13,431
Yeah.

300
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:19,242
- We need to figure out how to convince
Randall to accept a transplant.
- Why?

301
00:17:19,616 --> 00:17:22,142
We want him to stand trial,
to answer for what he did.

302
00:17:22,176 --> 00:17:24,072
The group wants to
keep Randall alive?

303
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:27,711
It wasn't exactly unanimous, but,
yeah, that's what we decided.

304
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,403
And they sent you
to talk to me.

305
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:33,033
I'm the social worker.

306
00:17:37,277 --> 00:17:38,480
Is there a donor?

307
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:40,561
There was a car
accident last night,

308
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:43,753
and the driver was an alcoholic,
so the liver's not great,

309
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:46,510
but if Randall wanted it,
he could have it.

310
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:48,553
So what do you want from me?

311
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:54,983
Tell me what we need to
do to convince Randall.

312
00:17:58,218 --> 00:18:00,410
There's only one thing
that will change his mind.

313
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:01,580
What is that?

314
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:03,030
Me.

315
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,912
That's why he's refusing help.

316
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,470
He's trying to get to me.

317
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:11,320
Would you talk to him if
it could be arranged?

318
00:18:12,988 --> 00:18:15,682
You don't really want to
stand up there alone, do you?

319
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:20,273
- When he's the one who's
responsible for what happened?
- I'm sorry. I can't.

320
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:23,242
I know how hard this would be for you,
but you owe this to us.

321
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:25,093
I know what it'll take,
and I can't go there with him,

322
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:26,100
not anymore.

323
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:27,530
I'm sorry.

324
00:18:51,738 --> 00:18:53,423
Hello, sir. How are you today?

325
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:56,510
Uh, fine, thank you, uh, Chet.

326
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:58,241
I'm fine. Hi.

327
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:01,460
Staying for a while?

328
00:19:21,017 --> 00:19:24,130
Let's go! Come on, let's go!

329
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:28,261
Let's go!

330
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:31,631
Come on! Let's go! Randall!

331
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,402
We're never gonna make it.

332
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:35,111
We're surrounded.

333
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,381
Everybody shut up
and do as I say. Now!

334
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:38,900
- My daughter's in here.
- Come on, move.

335
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:40,310
Do you hear what I said,
my daughter's in here.

336
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,260
- Okay, about 16,
wearing a school uniform?
- You've seen her?

337
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:44,080
That's my daughter Felicia.
Where is she now?

338
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:46,021
I don't know. I think she went
back this way. Just get down.

339
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:47,963
- But what if she...
- We'll get her in a minute. Get down.

340
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:49,592
Come on! We got a shot!
Come on!

341
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:51,860
You go.
I'll stay here and distract 'em.

342
00:19:55,615 --> 00:19:57,350
Don't spend it
all in one place.

343
00:19:58,525 --> 00:20:00,461
- Just get down.
- We'll find her.

344
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:02,382
Randall! Don't!

345
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:06,020
No, wait a minute, we can't just...
My daughter's in here!

346
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:15,240
Change of plans.

347
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:18,601
Get up and get back.

348
00:20:21,048 --> 00:20:23,572
Now get on back behind the
counter with the rest of 'em.

349
00:20:23,606 --> 00:20:25,661
Let's go.

350
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:30,352
Now get down.

351
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:32,250
Get down!

352
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:44,222
You have one unheard message.
Check unheard messages.

353
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:45,673
Hey, it's Kathryn.

354
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,472
We just wrapped
up at the diner,

355
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:49,423
and I...
I was just calling 'cause,

356
00:20:49,496 --> 00:20:51,800
well, nobody liked seeing
you leave that way, and...

357
00:20:51,837 --> 00:20:55,183
Look, I... I know it's hard,
the way everyone looks to you

358
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,131
and the position
that puts you in.

359
00:20:57,305 --> 00:21:02,030
Anyway, I... I just wanted you to
know that I... I knew that. So...

360
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:03,800
Well, take care.

361
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:24,692
Hello, son.

362
00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:26,863
You know I don't
want to see you.

363
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,493
Then why did you
let me in today?

364
00:21:33,636 --> 00:21:35,151
What do you want?

365
00:21:37,178 --> 00:21:38,583
How's it going, Dwight?

366
00:21:38,785 --> 00:21:39,903
Nick Cavanaugh.

367
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,102
You're the boss.

368
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,050
I was told you wouldn't
say much to my colleagues.

369
00:21:49,658 --> 00:21:50,812
Not an easy day.

370
00:21:51,606 --> 00:21:52,442
I know.

371
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,322
I'm very sorry
about your parents.

372
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:58,061
You should hear what the
news stations are saying,

373
00:21:58,095 --> 00:22:00,753
what they're saying
about me, too...

374
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:02,652
Sons that went so bad.

375
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:04,133
Yeah, it's all about you.

376
00:22:04,535 --> 00:22:07,631
- Lucas, that's not what I...
- Have you been to the hospital?

377
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:09,623
He needs a new liver.

378
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,411
Maybe you should
think about donating.

379
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:15,340
Well, you know I can't.

380
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,633
- With the surgery
I went through last year...
- Oh, right.

381
00:22:19,065 --> 00:22:20,601
I guess I forgot.

382
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:24,252
I guess it's been a big responsibility,
having to take care of them.

383
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:26,903
Yeah.

384
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:31,111
I saw all the pills
and the syringes and...

385
00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:33,792
Yeah, I gotta cook
for 'em, too...

386
00:22:34,656 --> 00:22:38,373
And clean up and get
'em to the bathroom.

387
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:43,261
And then sometimes, they can't even
make it all the way to the bathroom.

388
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:46,111
There was a bell in their bedroom.
Was that to call you?

389
00:22:46,268 --> 00:22:47,640
Every night.

390
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:50,673
4:00 in the morning,
like clockwork.

391
00:22:52,368 --> 00:22:54,851
You must be exhausted.

392
00:22:58,387 --> 00:23:00,162
I know what that's like.

393
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:02,400
You were a hero.

394
00:23:03,526 --> 00:23:05,792
Everybody was so proud of you,

395
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,631
- what you did for your country.
- Mother, please.

396
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:11,841
He has always brought you down.

397
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:14,120
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't put it all on him.

398
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:17,672
My old man was a drunk.

399
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:22,943
You know how much time I spent cleaning
up after the mess he'd leave behind?

400
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:25,651
And you know what
I'd get for it?

401
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:29,331
- Nothing.
- That's right.

402
00:23:29,648 --> 00:23:33,523
Not one ounce of appreciation.

403
00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:35,823
No matter what you do,
it's never enough.

404
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:37,841
Yeah, it's like
you're invisible.

405
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:41,840
I bet it's been that way
since you were a kid, too.

406
00:23:43,327 --> 00:23:45,053
Now it's everywhere, right?

407
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:50,171
Work... Your girl...

408
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,872
Your friends, if you got any...

409
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:53,470
Everybody pulling at you,

410
00:23:53,797 --> 00:23:55,150
suffocating you.

411
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:57,222
I know I've made mistakes.

412
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:00,751
But whatever happened
in the past, I...

413
00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:04,732
I want to be here for you now.

414
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:08,101
You don't have to go
through this all alone.

415
00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:17,853
About Reese.

416
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:19,432
Yeah?

417
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:21,522
That son of a bitch should take 
an easy way out.

418
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:24,103
Well, you never know.
He may change his mind.

419
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:27,683
Well, he dies,
we gotta go full bear at Lucas.

420
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:29,200
I always thought you were.

421
00:24:29,876 --> 00:24:31,131
We're still assessing,

422
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:33,371
but this will definitely
leave us with...

423
00:24:34,737 --> 00:24:37,431
You know, we really can't
be talking about this.

424
00:24:37,615 --> 00:24:38,720
It sucks, doesn't it?

425
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,741
More than you know.

426
00:24:45,755 --> 00:24:47,790
I have a favor to ask.

427
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,531
Sure. Anything.

428
00:24:50,737 --> 00:24:51,752
Well...

429
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:55,403
- You better hear it first.
- To Gene,

430
00:24:55,636 --> 00:24:58,460
who overcame the bitter
sting of one failed marriage

431
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:03,060
only to emerge out of the abyss better,
stronger, faster.

432
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:05,181
- Faster?
- Yeah, six million dollar man,
you know?

433
00:25:05,216 --> 00:25:07,953
They rebuilt him and sent him
out into the world to conquer,

434
00:25:07,985 --> 00:25:09,383
just like Gene.

435
00:25:09,637 --> 00:25:11,471
I only hope I have the same
strength as you, my friend.

436
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:12,622
Of course you do.

437
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:14,853
From your lips, as they say.

438
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,810
Well, anyway,
to second chances.

439
00:25:17,237 --> 00:25:18,580
Hear, hear.

440
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:20,293
Are you married, Jeremy?

441
00:25:20,546 --> 00:25:22,900
- Ever been?
- No, not yet.

442
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:24,861
- Lucky man.
- All right, come on.

443
00:25:24,907 --> 00:25:27,023
- Hello, everybody.
- Hey.

444
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,511
- How are we enjoying?
- Oh, it's great. It's perfect.

445
00:25:29,546 --> 00:25:32,183
- I think this places
works great for you, Foote.
- Oh, please.

446
00:25:32,217 --> 00:25:34,013
How are you doing?
They treating you all right?

447
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:35,860
Yeah, it's great.
Tips are great.

448
00:25:36,026 --> 00:25:38,173
Half of my friends are here.
It's all good.

449
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:39,930
What can I get
you guys to drink?

450
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:41,182
I could use another scotch.

451
00:25:41,217 --> 00:25:42,952
A scotch man.
That'll put hair on your chest.

452
00:25:42,986 --> 00:25:44,532
- You have no idea.
- 18 or 12?

453
00:25:44,637 --> 00:25:45,860
24 if you've got it.

454
00:25:46,075 --> 00:25:47,511
I think I can arrange that.

455
00:25:50,236 --> 00:25:52,302
She says he could
really be in trouble.

456
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:55,313
So I was thinking if we could
move Eva's ex out of Chino

457
00:25:55,348 --> 00:25:57,081
to another facility
where he was safe,

458
00:25:57,116 --> 00:25:58,850
then that should probably
get him off of Franny's back.

459
00:25:58,887 --> 00:26:00,242
And if this ex is lying?

460
00:26:00,496 --> 00:26:01,991
Well, then we'll deal with it.

461
00:26:02,037 --> 00:26:03,342
What's his rap sheet?

462
00:26:03,535 --> 00:26:06,093
Auto theft, couple B&Es,
mostly petty stuff.

463
00:26:06,286 --> 00:26:09,130
Still, I wonder why it never
came up in Eva's background.

464
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:10,531
Well, they were never married.

465
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:12,951
They had Ricky out of wedlock.
They never lived together.

466
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,073
So that's probably why he
never appeared in her records.

467
00:26:16,336 --> 00:26:17,972
And this is really
important to you?

468
00:26:18,006 --> 00:26:19,221
Very.

469
00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:21,583
Well, then I'll
see what I can do.

470
00:26:23,378 --> 00:26:24,710
Thank you.

471
00:26:44,295 --> 00:26:46,533
Welcome, Nick27.

472
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:48,551
Would you like a
seat at the table?

473
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:07,630
Whoo. Where's the boys?

474
00:27:07,907 --> 00:27:09,551
I think Stanley
went to throw up,

475
00:27:09,827 --> 00:27:11,612
and I haven't seen Jim
around for a while now.

476
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:12,492
Gene.

477
00:27:13,618 --> 00:27:15,401
Yeah, Gene.

478
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:18,483
Maybe you've had a little bit
too much to drink yourself.

479
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,782
- Lizzie's pregnant.
- What?

480
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:26,920
- Yeah.
- Hey! Congratulations.

481
00:27:27,575 --> 00:27:30,770
I want to do the right thing.
I really do.

482
00:27:31,188 --> 00:27:33,532
But I don't think
she's going to let me.

483
00:27:34,156 --> 00:27:35,160
She will.

484
00:27:35,597 --> 00:27:37,920
No, I wouldn't be too sure.

485
00:27:38,095 --> 00:27:40,320
When you walked into that bank,
you were in love, right?

486
00:27:40,355 --> 00:27:41,432
That's what I saw.

487
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:42,961
Well, I thought we were,

488
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:46,702
but... now I don't know.

489
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:51,770
Who's your favorite cocktail
waitress in the whole universe?

490
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:53,753
I don't know. Who?

491
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:58,443
The one who found you the best 30-year
single malt off the bottom shelf.

492
00:27:58,696 --> 00:28:00,421
Wow. You're a pro.

493
00:28:00,686 --> 00:28:03,133
How do you think I got myself
through two years of college?

494
00:28:03,168 --> 00:28:04,700
I didn't hear you
say the words.

495
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:08,340
You are my most favoritest cocktail
waitress in the whole world.

496
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,960
- Universe!
- Give me the drink.

497
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:12,412
Okay. Eggie?

498
00:28:12,606 --> 00:28:15,202
- Cosmopolitan, please.
- You are such a girl.

499
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:25,353
Oh. That's gonna make
things confusing.

500
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:53,231
Elizabeth Miller. I got a page.

501
00:28:53,556 --> 00:28:57,640
Ms Miller, it's a Lucas Dalton
calling from L.A. County jail.

502
00:28:58,147 --> 00:29:01,212
- Put... put him through, please.
- Go ahead.

503
00:29:01,246 --> 00:29:04,453
- Hello.
- Hi.

504
00:29:04,727 --> 00:29:07,043
- You said the group decided.
- Yeah.

505
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:10,403
- But it wasn't unanimous.
- Right.

506
00:29:10,637 --> 00:29:13,351
- Well, who wanted what?
- Why does it matter?

507
00:29:13,838 --> 00:29:15,253
I just want to know.

508
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:22,521
Nick and Egan thought
we should let him die.

509
00:29:23,236 --> 00:29:24,960
Malcolm abstained.

510
00:29:25,976 --> 00:29:28,243
Jeremy thought we should
try and save him.

511
00:29:28,956 --> 00:29:30,402
I wouldn't have thought that.

512
00:29:31,376 --> 00:29:33,272
No, me neither.

513
00:29:34,078 --> 00:29:35,422
And the others?

514
00:29:36,246 --> 00:29:38,763
Kathryn and Franny
want him at the trial.

515
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:40,990
- And me, of course.
- Franny...

516
00:29:41,626 --> 00:29:44,332
- How is she doing?
- Her sister's dead.

517
00:29:47,478 --> 00:29:48,620
And, uh...

518
00:29:49,447 --> 00:29:52,101
- What about Felicia?
- She couldn't vote.

519
00:29:52,937 --> 00:29:55,511
- Why not?
- She doesn't remember.

520
00:29:56,788 --> 00:29:59,710
- What do you mean?
- She doesn't remember anything...

521
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,011
barely.

522
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:05,862
Oh. I, uh...
I didn't know that.

523
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:07,373
Why would you?

524
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:12,003
Everyone's so messed
up from this.

525
00:30:13,518 --> 00:30:15,651
That's what this
is about, Lucas.

526
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:44,521
- Who's that?
- It's me.

527
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:47,382
You here to give
me my last rites?

528
00:31:48,547 --> 00:31:49,793
Not exactly.

529
00:31:50,298 --> 00:31:53,673
Well, I got nothing
to leave you.

530
00:31:54,906 --> 00:31:56,282
Why are you doing this?

531
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:01,020
I got so much to live for.

532
00:32:06,256 --> 00:32:07,731
We still got each other.

533
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:10,483
Do we?

534
00:32:16,097 --> 00:32:18,710
I know the way things
went down at the end.

535
00:32:22,517 --> 00:32:23,650
I was fried.

536
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:29,743
We hadn't slept in two days.

537
00:32:31,428 --> 00:32:32,672
It got out of hand.

538
00:32:35,095 --> 00:32:37,542
- I almost killed you.
- Yeah.

539
00:32:40,777 --> 00:32:42,763
I guess I got lucky.

540
00:32:48,988 --> 00:32:50,432
Mom been to see you?

541
00:32:52,287 --> 00:32:53,140
No.

542
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:56,232
- You?
- Huh.

543
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:06,451
Remember when we used to pretend
we were the wonder twins?

544
00:33:06,596 --> 00:33:08,890
Remember how we'd put
our fists together and...

545
00:33:08,928 --> 00:33:11,170
It was like we were
giving each other energy?

546
00:33:11,705 --> 00:33:14,471
And that time I broke my
ankle in Ned's ravine and

547
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:16,142
you gave me the fist, and

548
00:33:16,386 --> 00:33:19,012
I was able to get up and
walk all the way home?

549
00:33:20,227 --> 00:33:21,190
What...

550
00:33:22,465 --> 00:33:25,602
What a pansy you always were.

551
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,523
I'm gonna give you
a piece of my liver.

552
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,431
They're gonna put it in you.

553
00:33:36,696 --> 00:33:38,683
It'll regenerate
into a new one.

554
00:33:40,556 --> 00:33:42,550
It'll be like me
giving you energy...

555
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:45,262
Like the old days.

556
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:55,642
It's no skin off your back?

557
00:33:59,178 --> 00:34:00,323
I could die.

558
00:34:06,317 --> 00:34:07,693
You and me, brother.

559
00:34:09,128 --> 00:34:10,662
Like it used to be.

560
00:34:38,227 --> 00:34:39,441
Can we talk?

561
00:34:54,987 --> 00:34:56,830
I just want you to know

562
00:34:57,207 --> 00:35:01,240
that I take my responsibility
in this very seriously,

563
00:35:01,526 --> 00:35:03,523
and I want to be
a part of it...

564
00:35:05,288 --> 00:35:06,720
Lamaze classes,

565
00:35:07,507 --> 00:35:11,150
O.B. visits,
however you need me.

566
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:15,202
And if you don't,
that's okay, too.

567
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,623
You're not going to get
any attitude from me.

568
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,551
Whatever you need,
I'll be there,

569
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:21,121
on your terms.

570
00:35:23,118 --> 00:35:25,040
If only I knew what those were.

571
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:28,660
I've never really
done this before.

572
00:35:30,357 --> 00:35:31,610
Me neither.

573
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:41,281
So... friends.

574
00:35:43,886 --> 00:35:45,050
Friends...

575
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,290
With obligations.

576
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:19,592
That was so, so...

577
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:21,383
Oh, I don't know.

578
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:23,013
Intimate?

579
00:36:23,286 --> 00:36:24,702
Something like that.

580
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,721
Mmm. You happy?

581
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:28,261
Yes.

582
00:36:28,906 --> 00:36:33,533
- Yes, I'm happy, very, very happy.
- Good.

583
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:40,141
Oh, of course.

584
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,253
Hold on, hold on.

585
00:36:47,586 --> 00:36:48,422
Yeah.

586
00:36:51,716 --> 00:36:53,411
Randall's gonna do
the transplant,

587
00:36:53,585 --> 00:36:55,073
and Lucas is the donor.

588
00:36:55,455 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah, I'd say that puts
Lucas in a really bad spot.

589
00:36:58,407 --> 00:36:59,873
Great. Oh, hey.

590
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:02,413
Did you make any headway
on that other thing?

591
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:05,883
Yeah.

592
00:37:06,327 --> 00:37:08,401
No, don't do anything
until I get back to you.

593
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:09,812
All right, thanks, Dave.

594
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:12,100
What's wrong?

595
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:15,420
Turns out Eva's ex did
some time at Corcoran

596
00:37:15,696 --> 00:37:17,652
before they moved him
to Chino last year.

597
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:20,092
- So?
- Randall Reese was at Corcoran.

598
00:37:20,287 --> 00:37:22,330
They overlapped each
other for 18 months.

599
00:37:23,437 --> 00:37:25,352
No, no. It's a coincidence.

600
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,861
Well, you realize this could raise
questions about Franny, too, right?

601
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:30,941
I'm telling you,
it's just a coincidence.

602
00:37:31,036 --> 00:37:33,051
I was in there with
her for two days.

603
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:35,843
Eva had absolutely
nothing to do with this.

604
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:39,561
Well, I don't think the defense
knows anything about this.

605
00:37:39,595 --> 00:37:42,503
And I'd rather not even open up this
can of worms if I don't have to.

606
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:44,001
You can take my word for it.

607
00:37:45,058 --> 00:37:46,101
Okay.

608
00:38:10,136 --> 00:38:10,983
Egan.

609
00:38:11,698 --> 00:38:12,540
Egan.

610
00:38:16,918 --> 00:38:17,943
Hey, Nick.

611
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:20,160
What are you doing here?

612
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:22,262
Oh, um...

613
00:38:23,966 --> 00:38:26,303
I was out with, uh,
Gene and Stanley.

614
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:27,862
We went to some...

615
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,821
awful strip club.

616
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:34,020
Oh, I think I must have
had too many martinis.

617
00:38:34,675 --> 00:38:38,361
- Or was it cosmopolitans?
- Probably both.

618
00:38:41,175 --> 00:38:43,331
Uh, anyway, I...

619
00:38:43,558 --> 00:38:47,003
Well, I guess it occurred to me that
maybe you could use some company

620
00:38:47,537 --> 00:38:50,112
seeing as, uh,
that you're a bachelor, too.

621
00:38:50,426 --> 00:38:53,983
I mean,
I know it's not easy being alone.

622
00:39:06,868 --> 00:39:09,121
Lord, we know that
there are those

623
00:39:09,478 --> 00:39:12,171
who are not able to make it
to your House on this day.

624
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:17,292
And so we ask that you look
in on those who are poor

625
00:39:18,097 --> 00:39:22,003
and without homes
and without families.

626
00:39:30,297 --> 00:39:33,372
We ask you today Dear God,
for justice

627
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:35,293
for those who have been wronged

628
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:39,371
and for forgiveness for
those who have transgressed.

629
00:39:39,676 --> 00:39:41,580
For our fathers
and our mothers,

630
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:46,643
we ask for strength and
wisdom and compassion.

631
00:39:46,936 --> 00:39:48,762
We ask you today,
heavenly father,

632
00:39:48,998 --> 00:39:51,340
to look in on those of
our brothers and sisters

633
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:53,202
who are behind prison walls

634
00:39:53,497 --> 00:39:56,770
and all of those who
are sick and suffering

635
00:39:56,987 --> 00:39:58,602
and in need of healing.

636
00:39:58,878 --> 00:40:01,140
We ask you, Dear God,
to look upon

637
00:40:01,406 --> 00:40:04,463
all of those who are less
fortunate than ourselves

638
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:05,801
and bless them

639
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,312
and keep them.

640
00:40:08,987 --> 00:40:11,652
These things we ask today,
Dear Lord,

641
00:40:12,197 --> 00:40:13,973
in your Holy name.

642
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:15,892
Let us all say...

643
00:40:16,526 --> 00:40:18,873
- Amen.
- Amen.

644
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,603
Don't spend it
all in one place.

645
00:40:46,826 --> 00:40:49,071
Randall! Don't!

646
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:55,583
Change of plans.

647
00:40:56,285 --> 00:40:58,692
Get up and get back.

648
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:13,151
Get down.

649
00:41:44,506 --> 00:41:45,660
Well, well, well.

650
00:41:46,797 --> 00:41:49,291
Looks like we're all in
this thing together now.
