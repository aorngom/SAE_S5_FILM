1
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,634
And now, the news.

2
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,786
You wanna take it for a test drive?

3
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,300
Last week we talked
about you feeling like the sad clown.

4
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,545
What's going on now?

5
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,486
Well, I had a dream the other night....

6
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,591
I was riding in a Cadillac,
like my father used to have.

7
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,338
Carmela was driving,
and I was in the back passenger seat.

8
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,500
Sitting next to me was Gloria.

9
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,875
In front of me, sitting next to Carmela,
was a business associate of mine.

10
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,110
He's the one whose son had the accident.

11
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,414
I don't know where we were going. No place.

12
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,915
'Cause we never seemed to get anywhere.

13
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,253
Kinda like this therapy.

14
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,931
And it was hot in the car, it was stuffy.

15
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,328
There was no air- conditioning.

16
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,907
That's all of it.

17
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,410
Oh, and...

18
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,276
my friend had a caterpillar on his head.

19
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,546
It turned into a butterfly.

20
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,484
Has your friend recently changed?

21
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,692
Not a friend. Associate.

22
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,289
- And no.
- What do you think the dream means?

23
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,763
Can't you tell me
what the fucking thing means?

24
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,631
I mean, you obviously know.

25
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,863
Why do we have to go through
this exercise every time?

26
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,797
I don't obviously know.
I didn't have the dream.

27
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,772
The meaning is elicited
through verbalization.

28
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,313
And the gehoxtahagen is framed
up by the ramistan.

29
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,650
Okay. Your wife...

30
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,692
your mistress, a business associate, you...

31
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,663
all in the same car.

32
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,898
- Your father's car.
- With my wife driving...

33
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,936
which, if my father were alive...

34
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,569
he wouldn't have stood
for two fucking seconds.

35
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,765
I hear anger.

36
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,003
No, I'm just saying,
the old guys were different.

37
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,738
- Men in the front, wives in the back.
- You like that arrangement?

38
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:19,545
Actually, I think the wife
should ride in a little cart behind the car.

39
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,516
Like in the cartoons.

40
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,723
Like behind Noah's Ark,
there's a little boat with the skunks.

41
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,156
So wives are skunks?

42
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,716
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, it's a fucking joke.

43
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,093
Does it have to be
like a cancer hospital in here?

44
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,827
- But Carmela is in control in the dream.
- Why? 'Cause she's driving?

45
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:39,395
Whatever's gone on with the other two,
you want to square it with Carmela.

46
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,065
- Why?
- That's what we need to find out.

47
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,606
Freud says dreams are wishes.

48
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,473
Dreams are wishes?

49
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:52,547
I thought you said that dreams
represent repressed urges and--

50
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,587
- It depends.
- I oughta quit this fucking therapy.

51
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,419
"Maybe it's this, maybe it's that."
Maybe it's a fungule!

52
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:03,156
What about impulse control?
I been sitting in this chair for four years...

53
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,753
and nothing's been done about that!

54
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,958
And it leads me to make mistakes
at my work!

55
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,864
What good did you do me with that?

56
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:16,033
- Let's get back to the dream.
- Oh, fuck the dream, it's just a dream.

57
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,338
Jesus Christ, the money I spend here,
I could've bought a Ferrari.

58
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,903
At least I would've got a blowjob out of that!

59
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,006
- What do you mean?
- Please.

60
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,579
Don't get me started.

61
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:29,815
I think you're glossing over the significant
accomplishments we've made in here.

62
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,585
"My mother would come
when she looked at a pot roast."

63
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,354
"Oh, you're second in the birthing order."

64
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,886
"Oh, Carmela's driving the car,
how fucking interesting."

65
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:47,097
When you first came here,
you were clinically depressed.

66
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,973
You suffered from panic attacks
that put your life in danger.

67
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55,343
There's been significant relief
in both those areas.

68
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,105
You're right, but....

69
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,144
I mean, come on.

70
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,676
I've been coming here four years now.

71
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,987
I've been a good sport.

72
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,424
Sophia! Your jacket.

73
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,231
You're just getting over a cold, come on.

74
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,490
I miss you so much.

75
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,166
I'd be with you right now
if it wasn't for the kids.

76
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,209
We want a 40- percent position
in your HUD business.

77
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:03,271
'Cause I bent on the other thing, you're
entitled to reach into my pocket on this?

78
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,112
That was a gesture of goodwill.

79
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,382
We've been down this road before.
We share Zellman.

80
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,681
Therefore, any of the fruits of Zellman,
we're entitled to.

81
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,488
- We done here?
- Fucking Ralph.

82
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,887
Where's your point man on this thing?

83
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:23,129
- He missed his drops this week.
- I don't know. Maybe you can tell me.

84
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,640
About what we expected.

85
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,783
Blooming Onion. Cool.

86
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:44,187
The steak with the toothpick is Daddy's,
he likes it still mooing.

87
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,593
I saw on CNBC
that Outback's profitability is--

88
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:51,687
Excuse me.

89
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,059
- Dad?
- Wait, sit.

90
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,831
Sit and eat. It's a sin to waste good food.

91
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:01,670
Try the mushrooms. I don't know what
they do to them, but they're delicious.

92
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,481
I'm all right.

93
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,551
The kids are fed.

94
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,547
Thank you.

95
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,960
- What did you do with the cake today?
- Cake?

96
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,519
Your daughter saw it in the back of your car.

97
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,395
She told me about it
when I picked her up from practice.

98
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,831
I took it to Karen's grave.

99
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,775
I buried it.

100
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,279
Today was our anniversary.

101
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,817
Fourteen years.

102
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,623
I wish you would've told me about it
before I picked up the steaks from Outback.

103
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,385
The sides alone were over $30.

104
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,467
How often do you go to the grave?

105
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,639
Every day. That's what I miss the most,
talking to her.

106
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,381
Believe me, Bobby, I know.
I lost both my parents.

107
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,651
It's very easy for people
to give facile advice:

108
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,553
"Suck it up, move on," etc.

109
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,852
I'm not gonna tell you that.
Grieving is a process.

110
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,157
Sometimes courage isn't a value.

111
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,561
Tony.

112
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,729
- Hello?
- Look...

113
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,535
let's not let this get out of hand.

114
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,701
We've been doing good business
for a while now.

115
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,768
Carmine agrees. I agree.

116
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,176
Forty percent is not gonna happen.
We all know it.

117
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,949
I'm willing to go five and a half.

118
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,590
- Hello?
- Not acceptable.

119
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,597
This guy who does
the housing appraisals for Tony--

120
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,567
"Vic the Appraiser," they call him.

121
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,308
I want you to pay a visit
to this Polack Tony Soprano's...

122
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,778
got doing phony house appraisals.

123
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,041
Vic the Appraiser.

124
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,048
Make this guy understand
that he's gonna be working for us...

125
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,348
on these shithole houses
we bought in Jersey.

126
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,479
You got it.

127
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,322
Why did he get her a cake? She died.

128
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,560
Go back to bed.

129
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:46,498
Nicky Ghilardi said mommy's ghost
is gonna come back and haunt us.

130
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,002
There's no such things as ghosts.

131
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,470
The cake?

132
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,450
Maybe it was for the nuns.

133
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:03,978
Sometimes, when I'm walking down
the hallway, I can smell her hair.

134
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,527
Well, maybe if we did something bad,
she'd haunt us for our own good.

135
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,135
There's nothing to be scared of.
Go back to bed.

136
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,046
Tony's pretty hot...

137
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,842
that you didn't counteroffer.

138
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,943
God forbid, if this gets really bad...

139
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,380
there could be a change.

140
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,984
Tony?

141
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,861
Suffice to say, no matter what happens now,
or in the future...

142
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,590
Carmine won't forget you.

143
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,864
And as far as us talking like this....

144
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,606
It's just because we're old friends.

145
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,403
And I know I can blow off
a little steam with you.

146
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,079
Cheaper than a bartender.

147
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,412
I'm only trying to bring
good relations between the families...

148
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,882
as I always do and always will.

149
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,919
No matter what happens or who's in charge.

150
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,920
If it's me, God forbid...

151
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:13,883
or whoever.

152
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,758
- Hey, Branca. How you doing?
- Hello.

153
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,728
- Is he around?
- Shaving.

154
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,975
- How's your boss?
- Shaving his face.

155
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:34,206
No, your employer there, Miss Kirilenko?

156
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,673
Fine.

157
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,915
Reason I'm asking is
'cause we didn't get the bill.

158
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,519
- Here he is.
- I've fucking had it.

159
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,160
- With what?
- Everything.

160
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,026
- Did you offer my nephew something?
- I'm a registered nurse.

161
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,464
- Not maid.
- Did you offer him an aspirin?

162
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,433
Cunt.

163
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,477
What's with you?

164
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,384
This fucking competency hearing.

165
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,622
Delayed twice,
and now it's coming up on Friday.

166
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,660
I don't know whether to chill the champagne
or shit in my pants.

167
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,388
It's gonna be....

168
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,692
You got shaving cream all over you.

169
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,926
Don't you wash yourself off?

170
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,800
- It's over here, too.
- Yeah, it's that fucking lighting upstairs.

171
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,898
If Bobby put in the right wattage....

172
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,804
All right, listen.

173
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:47,046
We found out where the jurors meet every
day before they're bused to the courthouse.

174
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,451
Now if this mental competency thing
don't work--

175
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,011
I don't wanna talk about it.

176
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,159
So, what is the story there with you two?

177
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:03,093
He's a great guy.
He's just still very much in mourning.

178
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,198
We're stuck at platonic.

179
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,962
Well, Karen was a wonderful person.

180
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,199
I'm sure God must have his reasons...

181
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,369
but sometimes you have to wonder.

182
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:16,411
Well, I'm sure she was as good as gold,
but he's developing a psychosis.

183
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,716
Her clothes are still in the closet.

184
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,753
And yesterday he bought her a cake
for their anniversary...

185
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,515
and he buried it at her grave.

186
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,557
What? At her grave?

187
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:29,583
God forbid that I should say something,
because I would be perceived as a harpy...

188
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,120
coming between
him and his dead, idealized wife.

189
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,435
Listen, you,
don't make any plans for Sunday.

190
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,728
The Baccilieris are coming over.
Make those kids feel welcome.

191
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,742
- Bobby Junior? The kid's like 11.
- I don't ask you to do chore one!

192
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,836
You can go without seeing Devin
and your friends for one night.

193
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,439
Yeah, we were supposed to study.
But I guess you don't care about that.

194
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,184
Vic!

195
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,091
You don't return Johnny's phone calls?

196
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,790
What did you say?

197
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,859
I'm only the appraiser!

198
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,345
Now, let me appraise you of this.

199
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,251
Be at the Red Chimney on Route 3,
9:00 tomorrow morning...

200
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,551
ready to go to work
for Johnny and Carmine.

201
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,526
Victor's scared now.

202
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,333
- Nobody knows where he is.
- Look, it's a bluff.

203
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,734
They don't wanna start a separate operation.

204
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,204
You know the costs that are involved
in a HUD scam?

205
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,798
You got the appraiser, the poverty pimp.

206
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,741
They want in on a going thing.

207
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,336
You want me to pay a visit
to Johnny Sack's guys?

208
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,711
Just say the word.

209
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,109
You know what?

210
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,321
- I'm not gonna go fucking ballistic.
- All due respect, T.

211
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:07,050
Throwing your appraiser a beating
was a provocation to you directly.

212
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,294
There he is.

213
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,459
You tell him to stop beeping that horn,
or I'm gonna shove it up his fucking ass!

214
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,033
- All right, Sil.
- Enjoy the game.

215
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,032
- I'll see you, Tony.
- All right, Vit'.

216
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,069
You ever talk to Beansie
down there in Florida?

217
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,573
Now and then.

218
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,846
Does he ever run
into Carmine's son down in Miami?

219
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,714
I'll be on my cell if you need me.

220
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,794
Beansie tells me...

221
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:48,759
- he sees Little Carmine all the time.
- Well, maybe Beansie can feel him out.

222
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,600
See if he's receptive to a meet with me.

223
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,371
Maybe we can work this shit out,
if he talks to his old man.

224
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,141
Beansie's gotta happen to run into him.

225
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,012
Not like we're asking.

226
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,810
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

227
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,615
Look at that.

228
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,281
Just stuffed artichokes.

229
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,355
No cactus for me.

230
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,554
You're not Italian if you don't like artichoke.

231
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,995
So what, Mike Piazza
eats nothing but artichokes?

232
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,059
I mean, that's dicked up.

233
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,136
All right.

234
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,104
I like rice. Maybe I'm Chinese.

235
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,372
- A. J.
- You, too, Bobby.

236
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,214
How'd you like it if Oriental kids
were making fun of you?

237
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,310
I'll get it.

238
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,685
- You want an artichoke, Bobby Junior?
- No.

239
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,257
- It's dinnertime.
- You sure, B. J.?

240
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,520
- You're really missing out.
- I said already.

241
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,967
Hi, Mrs. Soprano.

242
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,737
Everybody, this is Devin.

243
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:06,700
- Would you like something to eat?
- No, thank you, I'll just wait inside.

244
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,813
She tell you who I saw
at Schantz's Hardware last week?

245
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:17,117
Oh, God, do you have to tell
every person you run into?

246
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,750
I'll put an end to the mystery right now.
Connie Francis.

247
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,024
Excuse me.

248
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,728
She was looking at recessed lighting.

249
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,493
I put in recessed lighting. But I'm sorry now.

250
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,501
- Hello?
- Tony, it's me.

251
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,899
Hey, how you doing?

252
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,302
Fine fettle. Listen, I spoke to our friend.

253
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,031
The son. He seemed very receptive.

254
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,698
Tuesday night.

255
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,340
We'll meet down here in Florida.

256
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,771
We'll pick a place later.

257
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,147
I got my stepdaughter
and her friends this weekend.

258
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,879
I'm gonna have to bring them along.

259
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,513
Okay, good. Thanks.

260
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,388
Somebody will call you.

261
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,455
Where is Anthony?

262
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,457
He went upstairs with that girl.

263
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,562
You two come with me.

264
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,634
That door is not supposed to be closed.

265
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,401
We were studying.

266
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,810
- Is this how you treat your guests?
- My guests?

267
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,542
You invited them.

268
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,944
These kids just lost their mom.
Could you give them a little time?

269
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,251
- You know how much Little Bobby likes you.
- Now what am l, daycare?

270
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,892
You must have a million games in here.

271
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,929
Clue, Monopoly.
Help them pick something out.

272
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,726
Come on in, kids.
A. J. 's gonna help you find a game.

273
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,172
Spirit...

274
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,844
speak to me.

275
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,242
Is Bobby Junior gay?

276
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,885
Now, do it again for real,
like last time with the dead little baby.

277
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,479
Quit messing around.

278
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,123
Okay, serious.

279
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,921
Spirits, identify yourself.

280
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,554
- You're forcing it again.
- Shut up!

281
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,729
Do you think it's my mom?

282
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,293
Probably not. It's not people you know.

283
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,463
- Will you do it with me, Devin?
- Okay.

284
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,947
Spirit. Do you know Karen Baccilieri?

285
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,854
Is she making new friends in heaven?

286
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,223
- Maybe we should play something else.
- This is stupid. Let's play Clue.

287
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,095
You're just a scared little baby.

288
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,964
I'm not scared. I have this game at home.

289
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,865
I used to play it all the time...

290
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,969
until it got boring.

291
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:52,571
How about we try
and contact the dead for real?

292
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,803
Just heard from our friend.

293
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,246
The other guy'll sit down.
I'm going on Tuesday.

294
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,841
- Want me there?
- I was thinking of bringing Paulie down.

295
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,148
Face time with you could be what he needs.

296
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,254
- He's on the rag lately.
- Then I decided against it.

297
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,384
The other day,
we were talking about Florida.

298
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:12,561
- I noticed you clammed up around Paulie.
- You did, too.

299
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,892
It occurred to me
that maybe Paulie's the one...

300
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,265
telling our friend in New York
all our business.

301
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,034
- Somebody had to pass along that fat joke.
- He was in Youngstown at the time.

302
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,837
- In the can.
- What, people can't visit him?

303
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,004
Jesus, you believe this shit?

304
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,011
We're talking about fucking Paulie here.

305
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,573
For now, he's got no reason
to know about the trip.

306
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,176
- Nobody's got a reason to know.
- Absolutely.

307
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,854
It's on a need- to- know basis.

308
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,386
And get this fucking appraiser
working again.

309
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,154
I got houses just sitting there.

310
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:44,955
You got to hold hands.

311
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,191
And nobody let go.

312
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,735
The most important thing...

313
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:56,202
is that you keep your eyes closed
during the ceremony...

314
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,300
because if you open them,
whatever spirits we're speaking to...

315
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,438
will permanently remain trapped
between worlds forever.

316
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,312
Everybody's eyes shut?

317
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,420
Oh, great spirit from beyond.

318
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,262
Reveal yourself.

319
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,822
Give us a sign of your presence.

320
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,130
- Keep laughing if you think it's funny.
- It was you.

321
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,836
- You hear that?
- What?

322
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,839
- I heard it.
- Me, too.

323
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,137
Wait.

324
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,706
I see a...

325
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,010
gray mist...

326
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,242
- with little specks of light.
- That's what I'm seeing, too.

327
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,309
Wait.

328
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,856
I see somebody. An old man.

329
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,455
Spirit from another dimension,
can you reveal yourself?

330
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,457
What?

331
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,534
- What's that?
- How come he's only talking to you?

332
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:02,136
Because I'm the oldest,
and closest to the afterlife.

333
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,140
You're a sea captain?

334
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,740
Captain Jacobus? What?

335
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:15,915
He says it's a terrible storm.
It's raining where you are?

336
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,680
Waves are smashing against the boat?

337
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,519
He's here!

338
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:27,030
Oh, Jesus Christ, they'll kill me.

339
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,367
What's going on?

340
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,332
Oh, my God, what happened?

341
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,772
Nothing, we were just playing.

342
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,241
We were playing Ouija board.
And then A. J. did this séance.

343
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,141
Dad, I want to go home.

344
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,541
Soph', it's just a Ouija board.

345
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:48,980
She's just scared.

346
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,783
It's okay, honey, Daddy's here.

347
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:54,155
This is your idea of fun?
You scared these kids half to death!

348
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,955
I didn't do anything. He freaked out.

349
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:59,861
- Why's your shirt all wet?
- Bobby, look, he had a sponge.

350
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,558
After what we just talked about,
this is what you do?

351
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,898
You asshole.

352
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,772
You, say good night.
You, get out of my sight.

353
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,171
I can't remember
when I was more disappointed in you.

354
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,713
- Good night.
- You know what?

355
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,874
He locked me in the garage
at the guy with the ponytail's house.

356
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,511
Bobby, I don't even know what to say.
I am so embarrassed.

357
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:25,179
Part of growing up, don't worry about it.

358
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,299
I'm only the appraiser!

359
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,098
What do you think?
You could hide from us?

360
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,575
Tony bought three more houses
that need appraisals.

361
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:50,411
I can't. I told you, please.
Johnny and Carmine's guys, they hurt me.

362
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,146
That's nothing
compared to what we're gonna do, Victor.

363
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,020
So go back inside, get your appraising shit,
and start appraising.

364
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,225
Did you like the movie?

365
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,334
What's the matter?

366
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,262
You went to the cemetery today, didn't you?

367
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,266
How do you know?

368
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,175
'Cause you got cemetery mud
on your shoes.

369
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,941
Mud? What are you,
Marge Hingenbrender now?

370
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:26,177
What do you know about the mud?
You been spying on me?

371
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:30,385
What, I can't go to the cemetery?
I got to get permission from you?

372
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,582
We're talking about you. Not me.

373
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,987
You know, the grave and the funeral....

374
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,561
It's never ending.
You don't want to let it go.

375
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,157
- Did you even pay the funeral bill yet?
- I'm never gonna pay him.

376
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:45,999
Son of a bitch put an extra 15 pounds
on Karen when they did her up.

377
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:49,438
This dispute with the bill is morbid clinging.

378
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,067
This is exactly what I mean,
we have a nice evening...

379
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,112
and we end up talking about your dead wife.

380
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,478
- You invited me.
- The other night at Tony's...

381
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,780
your kids were trying to contact Karen
on a Ouija board.

382
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,218
What do you expect?
You're talking to a headstone.

383
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,746
- She's my wife.
- She's dead, and I'm here.

384
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,293
- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut the fuck up.

385
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,212
Tony, it's Svetlana.

386
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,452
I've just received the brooch.

387
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,555
I want to thank you.

388
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,396
- I don't know why I deserve it, but--
- No, I don't want to hear that.

389
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,059
I want you to keep it.

390
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,729
I'm gonna keep it, don't worry.

391
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,166
Diamonds like this....

392
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,841
It's a very nice gift. Very sweet.

393
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,877
And what happened between us...

394
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,549
it was nice, too.

395
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,051
Okay, well....

396
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,853
That's it, then?

397
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,488
These things happen, and then life goes on.

398
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,549
Are you sure? Because...

399
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,220
if you ever want to talk,
or you ever need anything--

400
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,490
No, it's all right.

401
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,589
Thank you for the brooch.

402
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,473
Broke a woman's heart.
Told her I couldn't see her no more.

403
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,375
Sad, but there was no getting around it.

404
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,607
- Who is she?
- Takes care of my uncle.

405
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,379
Runs an elder care agency.

406
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,347
She took care of my mother, too.

407
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,516
- Your former girlfriend's cousin?
- That one, yeah.

408
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:50,927
- Is she your current cumare?
- No, some brief fling kind of thing.

409
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:55,858
You know, after a while,
I felt like I had to cut off her leg.

410
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,526
Not leg, affair.

411
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,927
- Did I say leg?
- Why did you cut it off?

412
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,003
Jesus, I am married.

413
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,765
- What happened?
- I bought her the....

414
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:10,643
It's this diamond pin
that I send to every woman when I'm...

415
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,312
easing out the door,
I'm such a fucking prick.

416
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:17,987
You know what?

417
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:20,318
This is all bullshit.

418
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,324
It was she who gave me my walking papers.

419
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,521
- You believe that?
- What I meant was that--

420
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,828
You know why
she didn't want to see me anymore?

421
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,663
She said that I was high maintenance.

422
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:34,501
And this is after all the time and
all the money and all the fucking Prozac...

423
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:38,064
and all the fucking cocksucking,
motherfucking dream interpretations.

424
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,077
And she says she didn't want to prop me up.

425
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,740
And this from a broad
that walks around on crutches half the time.

426
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,407
Nice?

427
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,509
Do you agree
with her characterization of you?

428
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,749
I'm a miserable prick.
I've said this since day one.

429
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,654
And you're no longer interested
in changing?

430
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,250
In finding a way out?

431
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,427
No, I guess not.

432
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,671
I said this last time.
You just didn't want to hear it.

433
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,043
You're paying me for my honest opinion.

434
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,911
You should be in therapy.

435
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:22,115
All this fucking self- knowledge,
what the fuck has it gotten me?

436
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:25,020
Okay, maybe it got me some shit
in the beginning.

437
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,852
Some leadership strategies.

438
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,950
All we do now is sit around half the time...

439
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:33,020
shooting the breeze about philosophy,
the Italians, my uncle Eckley.

440
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,997
I try to keep the focus on the work.

441
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:38,695
So when it goes off, it's my fault?
Okay, fine, I accept that.

442
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,067
You know what she says?

443
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,836
This broad...

444
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,308
she's from Russia, dirt poor.

445
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:53,677
She had some kind of osocarma disease
in her leg when she was nine.

446
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:58,883
She says that nowhere else in the world
do people expect to be happy...

447
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,949
except for here in this country,
and still we're not.

448
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,320
And we got everything.

449
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:06,124
And when we're not, what do we do?
We go to shrinks.

450
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,188
For what, $6 or $7 a minute?

451
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,763
There's some truth to what she says.

452
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,065
But should that be a source of shame?

453
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:17,403
That when the desperate struggle
for food and shelter is finally behind us...

454
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,367
we can turn our attention...

455
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:22,871
to other sources of pain and truth?

456
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,409
"Pain and truth."

457
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:27,474
Come on,
I'm a fat fucking crook from New Jersey.

458
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,256
Now that the panic attacks
and the baseline depression...

459
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:35,349
have been dealt with,
the real work can begin.

460
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:38,691
- I knew you'd say something like that.
- Because it's true.

461
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:42,062
When we're not constantly
having to put out fires...

462
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,062
we can really delve into who you are...

463
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:49,732
and what you're really after
in your very brief time on this earth.

464
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,872
I'm sorry.

465
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,307
I don't want to do this anymore.

466
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,685
And you can say that I'm running away.

467
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,085
But I've been here
longer than I thought I'd stay.

468
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,680
Longer than anybody ever thought I'd stay.

469
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,586
And you know what?
I get no appreciation for it.

470
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,886
You've shown a lot of courage.

471
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:14,998
I commend you on that.

472
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:19,298
Thank you for the commendation and adios.

473
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,576
Look, no fault, no foul.

474
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,739
I appreciate everything you've done for me.

475
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,476
Come to your next appointment.
One more time.

476
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:36,613
You'll cover my $300- a- week in no time
with some other mortadella.

477
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,883
All right, I shouldn't have said that.

478
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,559
Look, you saved my life in the beginning...

479
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,554
and for all the times
I came on like an asshole, I'm very sorry.

480
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,033
You've got my number
if you change your mind.

481
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:59,408
And if you begin to feel
any of the old feelings, you need to call me.

482
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:06,008
So, what's customary?
I mean, do we shake hands?

483
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,319
How about a diamond pin?

484
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,491
Okay, well....

485
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,531
Goodbye.

486
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,711
You've reached Doctor Elliot Kupferberg.

487
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,154
Please leave a message
at the sound of the beep.

488
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,714
If this is an emergency...

489
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:52,525
you can reach me at 973- 555- 7089.

490
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:58,167
Guess who's no longer a patient of mine.

491
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,629
Calling all cars.

492
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,540
His user name had 666.

493
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,840
That means Satan.

494
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,035
I was gonna park in that spot.

495
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,872
Ball breaker, welcome to Miami.

496
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,311
Mr. Melvoin, I've read your application
for dismissal...

497
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,375
on the grounds of mental incompetence.

498
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,479
And I've reviewed
the findings of the doctors in this matter.

499
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:03,220
Frankly, they were unmoved
by Mr. Soprano's performance.

500
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,763
Your Honor, to couch it as a performance--

501
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,356
It's their opinion
that he understands the charges...

502
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,698
and that he's more than competent
to participate in his own defense.

503
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,761
I'd like another round of testing.

504
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,397
Your Honor....

505
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:20,206
I didn't come all this way
to stop this trial now.

506
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:24,047
Court will convene on Monday at 9:30
to continue proceedings.

507
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,309
Your Honor, please.

508
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:29,649
Since his injury, I have not had
a single conversation with Mr. Soprano...

509
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,348
in which we've related
on any meaningful level.

510
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,118
Feel free to take that up on appeal.

511
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:43,793
Fuck!

512
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,937
We'll get to a juror. We're working very hard.

513
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,417
Hello?

514
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,158
Bobby, hi. What's up?

515
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,990
I was just doing housework. Why?

516
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,396
Is everything all right?

517
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,165
Oh, my God.

518
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,278
Tell me about it.

519
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:35,352
Got home tonight. Kids were kind of quiet.

520
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,187
Then bedtime, all hell broke loose.

521
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,785
Crying, wouldn't be left alone.

522
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,421
Sophia, especially.

523
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,527
They've been playing
with that goddamn Ouija board again.

524
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,601
- Oh, no.
- They were trying to contact Karen.

525
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,096
What?

526
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,771
I don't know what to say, Bobby.

527
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,315
I came over this afternoon
with some pound cake.

528
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,408
I saw it.

529
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,976
I heard them in his room
with that Ouija board.

530
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,352
I thought,"This is not good."

531
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:17,327
But then after the other night,
I didn't want to overstep my bounds.

532
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,486
It's my fault.

533
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:24,732
You're under a lot of stress.
You're a single dad.

534
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,570
No, you were right. It's bad for them.

535
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,669
- It's unwholesome.
- You want me to go up?

536
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,968
I think they're asleep. Finally.

537
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,710
I had to read to Sophia for like an hour.

538
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:42,184
She couldn't even handle a Nancy Drew,
it was too mysterious.

539
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,514
- Go ahead.
- It's just....

540
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,683
The dead have nothing to say to us, Bobby.

541
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:54,026
It's our own narcissism
that makes us think they even care.

542
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,493
It does get better with time.

543
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:04,930
Did you get anything to eat at least?
Can I fix you something?

544
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,568
No, it's too much trouble.

545
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,403
No, it's not. I'm starving, too.

546
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,278
There's probably something in here.

547
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,564
Karen's ziti?

548
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,265
It's the last one she made.

549
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:46,614
And it was like 300 degrees
in that Minnie Mouse head?

550
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,482
So I took it off, you know?
I was gonna have a cigarette.

551
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,681
- And some kid took a picture of me.
- Come on, girls.

552
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,418
These gentlemen have things to discuss.
Let's go.

553
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,529
Okay. Thanks.

554
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,725
- Nice meeting you guys.
- We'll see you at the bar later.

555
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,227
Look, Carmine.

556
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,905
You basically know what's going on
with your dad and Johnny...

557
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,500
and us over in Jersey.

558
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,502
First let me say, I understand.

559
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,816
I appreciate the respect
you're showing me by coming here...

560
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,784
and reaching out to me at this time.

561
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:22,910
Always.

562
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,716
I will also go on record as saying...

563
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,882
I know my old man
can be a tough nut to crack.

564
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:29,653
I don't want to crack nuts, but I will.

565
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,086
I feel the anger.

566
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,562
When I try, for the second time...

567
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,861
on a separate issue entirely,
to reach an accommodation...

568
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,267
and he don't even make a counteroffer,
where's his respect?

569
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:45,001
I don't know what kind of advice
he's getting from Johnny.

570
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,635
Johnny's always usually
a voice of moderation.

571
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,736
Me and him, we get along good.

572
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:53,181
So, all due respect,
let's not jump in and blame Johnny.

573
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,979
True. John's a pragmatist.

574
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,211
But he's also a greedy motherfucker.

575
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,416
He lives above his head a little.

576
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:05,688
I am reminded
of Louis the Whatever's finance minister:

577
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,792
De- something. He built this chateau.

578
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,333
Nicole and I saw it when we went to Paris.

579
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:15,065
It even outshone Versailles,
where the king lived.

580
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,375
In the end, Louis clapped him in irons.

581
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,582
Look, Tony.

582
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,715
All I can promise you is, I will look into it.

583
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:38,785
I understand you got to try to feel out
your old man so he don't give you'a mazz'...

584
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,831
you know, for sticking your nose in.

585
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:45,190
I haven't been afraid of my father
for quite some time.

586
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,801
Fair enough.

587
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:51,563
But, Carmine, bear in mind,
he came onto my turf.

588
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,541
He tried to recruit my mulignon.

589
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:57,406
And worse, he roughed up my appraiser.

590
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:02,847
If the proper response is not forthcoming
in a business- like time frame...

591
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:09,051
my next move
will not be further conversation.

592
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,150
I get it.

593
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,923
You should know that my next call
will be to Johnny Sack...

594
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,988
to let him know that we talked.

595
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,329
He shouldn't feel blind- sided.

596
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,583
Hello?

597
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,653
I'm here for the masoner job.

598
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,612
Me no speak the English.

599
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,451
Mi dispiace.
