1
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:46,739
You should've
just rang the doorbell,
brendan. Come on.

2
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,243
Hey, you! Yeah, you!
What are you doin'?

3
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,612
We found this truck
on the side of the road.

4
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:57,117
There might be some
transmission trouble.
You might wanna check it out.

5
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,252
What's goin' on here?
Hey, that's the truck.

6
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,755
The one stolen in newark?
Hey, what are you doin'
with the truck, asshole?

7
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,260
It's a gift
from tony soprano.

8
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,766
Let's call the cops.
Those are the fucking guys
that killed hector.

9
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:17,520
I don't fuckin' believe it.
We just returned the biggest
score of my whole year.

10
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,522
Listen, you fuck.

11
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:23,026
Uncle junior's been
breakin' tony's balls'cause
you hijacked that truck.

12
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:26,029
You're lucky tony doesn't
shove the cab up your ass.

13
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:30,033
What else
did comley say?

14
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,036
Nothin' much.

15
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:36,039
There was some stuff
missing from the truck,

16
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:39,542
but he didn't give a fuck
as long as the thing's back.

17
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:43,546
Then he said to tell tony
thank you, and if there's
anything tony needs, call.

18
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:45,048
Tony?

19
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:49,052
Those fuckin' junkie fucks,
they work for tony,
they hijack carmine's truck,

20
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:51,554
i get it back,
and old man comley's
thanking tony?

21
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:57,177
Well, i think
you should've taken care of this
christopher moltisanti thing...

22
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,179
the minute
it first happened.

23
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,682
You should've sent
a clear- cut signal:
You fuck with junior soprano--

24
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,686
take it easy.
We're not making
a western here.

25
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,443
Fuckin' family.

26
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,946
I bought his kid
a $400 surfboard
for his birthday.

27
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:44,107
Mr. Soprano?

28
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:46,609
How you doin'?

29
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:55,618
What's that,
a trick picture out there?

30
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:59,122
- Which?
- The barn.

31
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:02,625
And the old tree,
all rotted out inside.

32
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,628
It's just a picture
i bought, um--

33
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:08,631
i- i remember--
in a little gallery
in provincetown.

34
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:12,135
That is a special- made
psychological picture,

35
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:15,138
like that, uh,
that what- do- you- call- it test.

36
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,142
The "korshack."

37
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:21,144
You think
i want to trick you?

38
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:23,646
- Oh, no.
- What does that picture
say to you?

39
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:25,648
It says,"hey, asshole,
we're from harvard.

40
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:29,652
What do you think about
this spooky, depressing barn
and this rotted- out tree?"

41
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:32,155
It's depressing
and scary to you?

42
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:34,157
Not to me.

43
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:37,160
But it's got that
built right into it.

44
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:39,662
How are things?

45
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:41,664
Good.

46
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:43,666
Had a real good week.

47
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:47,670
Friend of mine's
in the hospital.

48
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,175
That's never pleasant,
but otherwise
i'm having a good week.

49
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:55,178
What's he in for?
First they thought
it was an ulcer.

50
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:57,180
Then this, then that.

51
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,182
You worried about him?
Jackie?

52
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:02,685
Jackie's so fuckin' mean,
he'll scare that cancer away.

53
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:05,188
Your friend has cancer.

54
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,358
Dr. Stevens, dial 107.

55
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:10,860
Hey, jackie,
when they hook you up,

56
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,864
do you watch to make sure they
don't have air in your veins, or
do you think this is bullshit?

57
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,482
What do you mean?

58
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,484
This is a good hospital,
sweetheart.

59
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,987
Nothing like that
is gonna happen here.

60
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,239
Air in the line'll
kill ya.

61
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,241
Know who else--
hey.

62
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,745
Know who else
has cancer?

63
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,747
Tommy dipalma.

64
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:34,250
He's got it much worse
than you, though.
It's eatin' his brain away.

65
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,003
Is somebody havin' a baby
or what?
Hey!

66
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,505
How you doin'?
How are ya?

67
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,507
How you feelin'?
Good. Good.

68
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,011
Hey, hesh, good to see you.
Thanks for comin'.

69
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,014
Jackie.
Lookin' well, pal.
Hey, thank you.

70
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,649
Here, ro.
Jackie.

71
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,652
You're beautiful.
You're beautiful.
This is a surprise.

72
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,405
Mikey, nice to see you again
in men's clothing.

73
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:57,407
I think i should grab
a fire extinguisher.

74
00:05:57,407 --> 00:06:01,911
Heard a friend of yours had
a spontaneous combustion
in his restaurant.

75
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:04,914
I'm going to the cafeteria.
You want anything?

76
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:08,167
- Yeah, a plate of braciole.
-

77
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,170
you look good.
They got grappa
in this thing?
I wish.

78
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,923
See you later.
I got some errands, jackie.

79
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:16,926
Give junior my love.
I will.

80
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:19,929
Hey, tell my uncle
i sent back
the fuckin' truck.

81
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:22,682
Now give me that quart
of vinegar peppers
he owes me.

82
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:25,051
Sure.

83
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,054
Oof.
Thank god he left.

84
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,057
He's a nice guy, but he's
like the grim fuckin' reaper.

85
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,561
It's like he knows every guy
with a fuckin' cancer cell,
and he can't wait to tell ya.

86
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,065
You know, jackie,
you might be a candidate
for clinical trials.

87
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,567
These, uh,
stump cell therapies--

88
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,821
paulie, don't you listen?
He don't wanna hear
no more cancer talk.

89
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,706
Get the fuck outta here.

90
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,208
Trust me, you caught a break
bein' jewish.

91
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,211
See what
i gotta deal with?

92
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:56,966
Jews. Jews, that's right.
I knew there was somethin'.
You know that guy teittleman?

93
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:01,220
Owns all that property.
Got a motel down the street
from the club.

94
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,973
The jew with the black clothes
and the curls and everything.

95
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,475
They're called hasidim.

96
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:07,477
Hasidim,
but i don't believe'em.

97
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,979
What's he want,
this teittleman?

98
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,099
- A divorce for his daughter.
- What are you talkin' about?

99
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,103
Teittleman's son- in- law will not
give teittleman's daughter
the consent...

100
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,106
unless teittleman gives him
50 percent of his motel.

101
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,108
They call it a "get."

102
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,110
Why don't he just, uh--

103
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:27,497
uh, it's, it's taboo
for their religion.

104
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:29,499
You know
about this shit?

105
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:33,002
Run, huh? Trust me.
You don't want to do business
with these people.

106
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:36,506
He said there's 25 large in it
if we can get him this here,
uh, this here "get."

107
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,508
There's an old saying
amongst jews:

108
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:41,511
When a jew gets a divorce,
even the altar sheds tears.

109
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,379
All right, i heard enough.

110
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,516
Hey, look, i'm gettin'
kinda tired here.

111
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:52,388
- Let's go get a cup of coffee.
- We'll see ya later, jackie.

112
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,273
Good night, jackie.
Yeah.

113
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,667
That crash you all heard
was meadow soprano
jumping her cue.

114
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,554
Miss marris,
we're really exhausted
from studying for s. A. T. S.

115
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:26,556
We were up past 2:00
last night.

116
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,558
- Are you her lawyer?
- No.

117
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:31,177
Why they'd schedule the s. A. T. S
the same week as our recital--

118
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,429
- sameday.
- What?

119
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,683
Get kicked out
of concert singers...

120
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,186
and there goes
our best extracurricular.

121
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,189
Good- bye, berkeley,
hello, glassboro state.

122
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:48,194
I cannot wait until the
whole north american land mass
is between me, tony and carmela.

123
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,196
New jersey blows.

124
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,198
I want to go to berkeley
so bad.

125
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,200
The whole east,
i can't deal anymore.

126
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,702
So we don't sleep
till after the s. A. T. S.

127
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,705
Don't mind the mess.
I wasn't expecting company.

128
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,209
I couldn't wait.
I had to see the new house.
Where's king arthur?

129
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,211
Oh, he's downstairs.
This plumbing--

130
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,213
here?
Yeah.

131
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,217
Oh, i love
the coziness.

132
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,720
Welcome
to the neighborhood.

133
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,223
Well, the school district,
anyway.

134
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,860
Carm, you did not
have to do this.

135
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,363
I mean,
we don't see each other
like we used to, and--

136
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,233
i want that to change.

137
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,122
- Could this be artie bucco?
- Hey, capitan.

138
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:37,376
Place looks good.
Ah, it needs a little work,
but we'll get there.

139
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:41,631
You need some start- up cash
until the insurance settlement
on the restaurant comes--

140
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,633
ha!
Insurance.

141
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:46,636
There'll be an italian president
before i see any
insurance money.

142
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,888
I thought that was settled.
Join the club.

143
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:51,641
They're putting us through
a second arson investigation.

144
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:55,895
Do they think you're mobbed up?
You're a working stiff.
It doesn't make any sense.

145
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:59,649
Who would burn down
a perfectly good restaurant?

146
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,767
It's stupid.

147
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,770
Insane.

148
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,774
I'm sorry, artie.

149
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,777
Life goes on, no?
I could always be
a plumber, no?

150
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,779
Only one concept to master.

151
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,032
Shit runs downhill.
Yes, it does.

152
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,168
Come in the kitchen.
I'll buy you a beer.

153
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,432
Mr. Soprano.
Mr. Teittleman.

154
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,434
My pleasure.
Please,
have a seat.

155
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,436
Thank you.
Silvio you know.

156
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,940
Paulie.
Paulie,
how are you?

157
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,060
This is my son.

158
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,564
- Does he have a name, or
do we have to give him one?
- Oh, i'm sorry. It's hillel.

159
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,202
You know the story
about my daughter
and her husband?

160
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:55,204
Yeah, he knows.

161
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,457
- Do you have a daughter,
mr. Soprano?
- Yes.

162
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,459
Call me tony.

163
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,462
What would you do
if your daughter was
abused by her husband?

164
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:06,966
Talk to him.
Yeah,
in ball- peen hammer.

165
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,968
I think you understand
my anger.

166
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:13,472
He's not only harming
my daughter, but he's mocking
our laws of marriage.

167
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,976
Look, let's
understand each other
from the get- go here, okay?

168
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,478
I'm in the carton and
waste- management business.

169
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,982
I'm only here because
i'm a friend of silvio's,
you're a friend of silvio's.

170
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,235
You may be having
a family problem
that i can help you with,

171
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:28,738
and if i can do it,
that'll make me happy.

172
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:31,607
- What's your fuckin'
problem, pal? -

173
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,619
please finish.

174
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:47,373
- You're being shaken down
for 50 percent of your motel.
- Correct.

175
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:51,761
And the rabbi goon squads
who used to smack these husbands
around to get the divorce?

176
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:55,631
They've been put out of business
by the d. A. 's office.

177
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:59,135
All right, 25 percent.
He wants 50, we get 25.

178
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,638
- I don't understand.
- That's'cause
i'm not talking to you.

179
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:16,786
You get me what i want,
mr. Soprano,
and you have a deal.

180
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:18,788
It's done.

181
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,159
Put these people in our motel,
and you'll never get them out.

182
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,161
That's a commercial,
isn't it?

183
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,172
Julio, before lunch
i want you to do
bedding inventory.

184
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,174
Si, si, si.

185
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,676
Half hour.
And nocervezas,
please.

186
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,682
Yes,
may i help you?

187
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,684
That depends.
Are you ariel?

188
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,821
That also depends.
Are you a bill collector?

189
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,074
What is this, the catskills?
Shecky greene, we got here.

190
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,828
- We want to talk to you
about your father- in- law.
- I'm sorry, he's not here.

191
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,579
We know he's not here,

192
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:04,083
but we want to talk to you
about him and you,

193
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,586
him...
and this little problem
that you're having.

194
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,089
Look,
i don't know who you are,

195
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:14,093
but any problem i may or may not
be having with my family
is none of your matter.

196
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,095
So get out of here, huh?

197
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:19,598
Now, now, look,
shlomo is a friend of mine.

198
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,100
And you're bragging this?

199
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,102
Oh, this guy--

200
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,104
listen, listen.

201
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,106
You couldn't
possibly understand
what's going on here.

202
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,477
Shlomo is an arrogant,
ignorant control freak.

203
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,480
Look, i know him
since before i had hair
on mypetzel.

204
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,981
I made this place.

205
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:40,736
The flyers,
the car rental drop- off,
the business breakfast,

206
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,738
it was me, not him.

207
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,741
I sweated blood
into this place,
and he owes me,

208
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,743
and i intend
to get what's mine.

209
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,246
So please,
don't embarrass yourself
any further.

210
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,248
Just leave.

211
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,250
I'm not embarrassed.
You embarrassed?

212
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,254
Listen to me,
you weirdo fuck.

213
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,256
You give shlomo
whatever he wants,

214
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,258
and you forget
this 50 percent shit.

215
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,260
You got nothin'
comin' to ya.

216
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,262
You understand me?
Nothin'!

217
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,264
Fuck you!
Bupkes.

218
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,266
Say"bupkes,"paulie.
What?

219
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,768
That's how they say
"nothin'."

220
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,271
Fuck that.
This is how i say "nothin'."

221
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,273
How's that
for nothin'?

222
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,411
You know what?

223
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:24,413
Probably not.

224
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,415
The fund- raiser
of pediatrics hospital?

225
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:29,418
I'm gonna hire
artie and charmaine
to cater it.

226
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,924
Come on, this fund- raiser.
Since when do we open our house
to strangers?

227
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,676
Oh, you're right.
Let's just move back
to italy.

228
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,679
We'll live
in a little hill town,
just like our ancestors,

229
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,182
put a big wall
around it,

230
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,685
and we'll throw burning oil
at all the travelers
that knock at the gate.

231
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,192
Poor charmaine.

232
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,195
I tried to find nice things
to say about that house.

233
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,698
It wasn't that bad.
It just needs a little work,
that's all.

234
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,700
Those two are so broke.

235
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,702
That fire.

236
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,704
If that insurance'd
get off its ass--

237
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:09,208
- do you think
it could've been arson?
- What's the matter with you?

238
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,713
Hey!

239
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,839
Yeah, put matt on.

240
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,841
Hold on.
What's going on
in here?

241
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,344
You trying to damage
your inner ears?
We're studying.

242
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,847
These are just
practice tests,
and they're brutal.

243
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,233
Your parents know
you're here this late?

244
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:36,485
Yeah.
They don't care.
She's sleeping over.

245
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,857
Can hunter
please sleep over?

246
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,994
Start sleeping, then.
Study time's over.

247
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:48,364
We still have
six more chapters left.

248
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,367
Then can you keep
the decibel level
down, please?

249
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,369
For my husband.

250
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,374
Matt,
i'm serious, you guys.

251
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,377
Matt, if we can't
score some crystal,
we're dead.

252
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,264
Okay, with this budget
we can do three waiters
for the passed hors d'oeuvres,

253
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,266
two for the champagne.

254
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,268
It's such a load off,
you're helping.

255
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,271
The whole party has me
at sixes and sevens.

256
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,773
Pediatric hospital's
such a worthy cause.
Oh, no.

257
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:18,027
Oona!

258
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,397
There is fingerprints
all over the breakfront.

259
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,149
I want this place
to sparkle.

260
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:28,537
She's usually very good.
From poland.

261
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,157
Please get in the car,
sir.
Come on.

262
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:36,912
Like the cop would be callin'
this asshole "sir" if the
fuckin' cameras weren't around.

263
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,415
I saw this one anyway.

264
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:44,420
So why don't you call tony
so he can call junior and see
if we can change the channel.

265
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,422
Get that,
will ya, babe?

266
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,425
Sure. I'm the only one
who has to go to work
around here.

267
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,927
Yeah, restaurant hostess.
Real tough work.

268
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,929
It's your little cousin.

269
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,932
Hi, adriana.
Hey.
How you doin'?

270
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,184
- What are you doing here?
- Hello to you, too.

271
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,186
And hunter,
what are you doin'?

272
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,188
Don't mind him.
His brain is fried.

273
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,190
You want a soda
or somethin'?

274
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,192
How'bout a beer?
Yeah, right.

275
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,196
Just kidding.
I'll have a coke,
if you have one.

276
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,333
- So, what do you want, meadow?
- I think she wants
somethin' from me.

277
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,835
In your dreams, brendan.

278
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,456
So, if you don't want somethin',
what do you want?

279
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,458
I want to cop.

280
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,346
Here you go.

281
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,348
What do you mean,
"cop"?

282
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,850
Score.
We want to score
some crystal.

283
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,603
- Yeah? You got money?
- Shut up!
You ain't givin' them shit.

284
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:38,607
- Why not?
- For starters, your father'll
put a bullet in my head.

285
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:41,610
Since when do you
take speed, anyway?

286
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,613
She doesn't.
I need it to study for exams.

287
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:47,483
Yeah, right.
Hunter needs it.

288
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,119
Forget about it.
No fuckin' way.

289
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,624
- What?
- He just craves attention,
hunter.

290
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:01,497
Fine. Just thought i'd ask you
before we went down
to jefferson avenue.

291
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:05,501
Those moolinyans'll rob you,
rape you and leave you
by the side of the road.

292
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,638
I don't know
what you see in him.

293
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:11,640
Money.
What do you think?

294
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:14,143
Fuck you.
See ya,
christopher.

295
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,645
I got my own money.
What about me?

296
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,014
Nobody's gonna say
good- bye to me?

297
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,402
Bye.
- Bye. -

298
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,404
bye, guys.

299
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:32,911
You can't let her go down
to jefferson ave.
They'll sell her ajax.

300
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:36,415
She's not gonna go down there.
She's just tryin' to get me
to give her some speed.

301
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:40,419
Isn't it better if she gets it
from you, with all that poison
that's floatin' around?

302
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,425
Kids. You think
you can protect'em,
but you can't.

303
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,545
As the rainy season
approaches,

304
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,047
the chimps will alter
their eating habits.

305
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,049
You watchin'
that nature shit again?
Hey.

306
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,051
What are you doing here
so late?

307
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:00,055
My kid stepped on a nail.
Had to get him a shot.
Where is he?

308
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,057
The emergency room
with carmela.

309
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:06,311
So, uh, whatever happened
with the jew at the motel?

310
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:10,199
We reached out to him,
he wasn't receptive,
they're going back.

311
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:17,206
Want me to leave?
No problem. Just looking
for my nurse's pen.

312
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:20,709
Uh, i think you got
the wrong room there, hon,
'cause you are not my nurse.

313
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,711
I know,
but i made up the bed.

314
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:26,215
No, sweetheart,
i have not been out
of this bed all day.

315
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:29,718
I'm sorry.
I just need to check
some vitals.

316
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:32,721
Hey, what are you doin'?
Hmm. That seems
to be working fine.

317
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:36,225
Look at these flowers.
Nobody sends flower arrangements
like new york.

318
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:39,228
Let me just check his--

319
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:43,732
this--
this damn-- this damn i. V.

320
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:48,103
Damn-- i got it.

321
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,356
Oh.

322
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,243
- I seem to be having
a problem here. -

323
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:58,113
- do you mind if i borrow
one of your gowns?
-

324
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,365
it's okay.
It's a private party.

325
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,871
Thank you. Thank you.
Have a nice night.

326
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,123
Oh, maron.

327
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,509
Oh!

328
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,629
Ahh!

329
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,269
I got you, you prick!
You shoulda seen your face!
You shoulda seen your face!

330
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:23,889
You prick!
"I ain't been out of bed
all day, honey."

331
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,141
- Look at your face.
- Wha-- who the hell is this?

332
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,644
Relax, mr. Aprile.

333
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,146
It's time
for your sponge bath.

334
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:40,789
She's a friend of mine
from the club.
Nice girl.

335
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:44,793
I joined'em later on.
We got a little booze.
You know.

336
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:50,299
That was nice of you
to have a party
for your friend.

337
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,301
Yeah.

338
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,309
Tufts medical school.

339
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:02,177
Mm- hmm.

340
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,183
You're a doctor.
What do you think?

341
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:10,319
About jackie.

342
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,322
I'd have to know more
about his condition.

343
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:16,325
I told you
about his condition.
He's got cancer.

344
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:19,444
- What kind of cancer?
- It's in the intestines.

345
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,448
There was a tumor,
and they took it out.

346
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,450
That's recurred.

347
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,087
But you said he might go home.
They're not operating?

348
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,090
It's next to
somethin' vital.

349
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,459
- I see.
- You see.

350
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,714
- From what you're telling me,
it doesn't sound very good.
- From what i'm telling you.

351
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,217
- What the fuck do i know?
I'm not a doctor.
- You're angry. Who with?

352
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,102
Let me tell you somethin'.

353
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,606
This man has had chemo every day
for three fuckin' weeks,

354
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,609
and he still has
every last hair on his head.

355
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,612
Every last hair on his head,
and he's got
a beautiful head of hair.

356
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,615
So don't tell me how it sounds,
'cause you don't know him,
you don't know me...

357
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,618
and you don't know
what the fuck
you're talkin' about.

358
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:04,239
We're getting closer to you
confronting your true feelings
about what's going on here.

359
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,242
Wait a minute.
I just told you
my true feelings.

360
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,244
You tell me
what's really goin' on.

361
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,247
The tree in the painting.
Rotted out, you said.

362
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,249
There's nothing in that picture
to indicate that.

363
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,388
The fuckin' painting--
i knew that painting
was a fuckin' scam!

364
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:21,390
You remember your dream?

365
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,642
The ducks?

366
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,644
It took on
another meaning.

367
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,648
What happens to a tree
that's rotted out?

368
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,767
Trees, ducks.
What the fuck are you,
ranger rick?

369
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,769
Some job
you shrinks got.

370
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,522
You think everybody's
lying to you while you're
pullin' scams on them!

371
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,025
Fuck you!

372
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,446
Uh- huh.
There's 37 definites.

373
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:48,950
We got another 13 maybes,
plus the whole
pediatric hospital board.

374
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:53,455
Right.
Are you sure we ordered
enough champagne?

375
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,458
Right.

376
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,461
Jean says they
shouldn't be too sober
for the silent auction.

377
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,714
If anyone ever finds out
you got this from me--

378
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,716
yes!
Look at me.

379
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,718
This is no joke.

380
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,222
You and me don't always
get along, but i don't think
you want to see me dead.

381
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,225
I gotta call hunter.
You're the best.
Hey. I'm serious.

382
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,227
Just this once.
Okay?

383
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,230
I'm no drug dealer.
I just don't want to see you
get poisoned.

384
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,232
You father
ever finds out--

385
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,734
god, doesn't anyone
ever knock?

386
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,238
Look, tell brendan
that hunter would rather die
than go out with him.

387
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,240
Brendan?

388
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,243
Keep that asshole
away from that child.
You understand me?

389
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,247
The guy asked me to
do him a favor, i did it.
You delivered the message.

390
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,249
Now let meadow study.

391
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,256
Two goombahs from
the old neighborhood.

392
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,759
What, they think they're
gonna name the soprano wing
in the new hospital...

393
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,761
with the bulletproof glass
and the--

394
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,763
you're just jealous
of their money.

395
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,765
Me?
Yeah.

396
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,767
Okay,
but explain to me this:

397
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,770
The guy offers us
two tickets to the caribbean
out of pure friendship for me,

398
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,773
you won't take'em
'cause they're tainted.

399
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,659
But for some snob- ass party,
it's all right i take his money
to clean his toilets.

400
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:08,914
First of all, arthur,
this is a paying job
and not some cruise.

401
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,416
And why do you always
have to exaggerate?

402
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,919
You're not cleaning his toilets.
You're a chef.

403
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,921
Good.

404
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:19,424
So you don't mind
that he fronts me some money for
a new place, 'cause he offered.

405
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,428
Look at that face.

406
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:27,432
Oh, god, arthur, don't tell me
that you took money
from tony soprano.

407
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,935
How is it different?
Howis it different?

408
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,938
I'm a chef.
I need a place to cook.
How?

409
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,440
I'm giving carmela my support,
that's how.

410
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,442
And it's for
a very reputable cause.

411
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,945
But to have
that man as a partner--

412
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,947
trust me, artie,
that would be insane.

413
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,949
It would mean
the end of everything.

414
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,951
At least
he made the gesture.

415
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:49,955
Name me another fuckin' person
who offered us anything
except the sopranos.

416
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:53,208
You wanna watch
what you're doin'?
You're squeezin' the quail.

417
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:08,557
Do you like the food?
I was so busy schmoozing,
i barely had a bite.

418
00:25:08,557 --> 00:25:12,310
You are not gonna miss
those little veal "tonatas."
Charmaine!

419
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:15,814
Charmaine!

420
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:26,575
Not in the car!
Please, not in the car!
Shut up!

421
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:28,577
Let me go,
you sons of--
shut up!

422
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:31,780
Get in that fuckin' car!
Get in there, you--
no!

423
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,783
You miserable
fuckin--

424
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,842
i can't get used to havin'
all these strangers
in my house.

425
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,595
Why'd you invite them?

426
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,349
Try one of these.

427
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,471
You're a fuckin' great cook,
artie.

428
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,356
I cook like this,

429
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,611
it reminds me
of what i lost.

430
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:05,614
Havin' my restaurant
ripped from me--

431
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:07,616
i can't tell ya.

432
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,485
It was like losin' a limb.

433
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,739
Sometimes i lay
in bed at night--
okay, enough already.

434
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,126
Why don't you
forget about the past.
Look to the future.

435
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:20,629
I am sick of hearin'
about your fuckin'
restaurant.

436
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:22,881
Shut up about it,
you depressin' fuckin' jerk.

437
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,250
What the fuck
do you know about it?

438
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,637
Don't--
you motherfucker.

439
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:38,146
Uh- huh.
You fuckin' jerk!

440
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:40,649
Come on.
Give it up.

441
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:47,656
See what you get?

442
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:52,027
You fuckin' son of a bitch.

443
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,530
Get up,
you stubborn fuck.
Please!

444
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,532
Too late for pleases,
you stupid fuck.

445
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,036
All this because you won't
say "yes" to a divorce?
It's not that simple!

446
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:05,040
Why not?
You sign your fuckin' name
to a piece of paper.

447
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,543
I don't like you.
Yeah? Well, i don't like you.
How's that?

448
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,429
- You believe this prick?
-
what do i get, huh?

449
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,432
You work for nothing?
I don't think so!

450
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:16,935
I say we force- feed him
his sombrero.

451
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,937
She wants to go to israel,
i send her.

452
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,939
She wants something done
to her body, i pay.

453
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,942
I feed her, clothe her,
put a roof over her head.

454
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,945
On top of that, i work
for her father for 20 years
and put up with his abuse.

455
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:29,948
I should walk away
without a nickel?
That's it. Stand up.

456
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,950
We don't care.
Tough fuckin' luck.

457
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,570
Aaah, you fucker!

458
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,073
Silvio!

459
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,580
Motherfucker.

460
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,582
This guy's a bull.

461
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:51,586
Paulie, if we don't
kill this prick,

462
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,588
we should put him
to work.

463
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,091
Yaaah- oooh!

464
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,096
Time's a- wastin'.

465
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,599
You're lucky
i could get out at all
with that party tonight.

466
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,605
Shit!

467
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,113
Hello.

468
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,616
Tony, sorry
to bother you down there.

469
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:26,121
This thing isn't working out
the way we'd hoped with our
friend with the funny sideburns.

470
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,124
Don't say no more
on the phone--

471
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,626
i'm comin' down.

472
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,628
Shit!

473
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:36,131
I gotta go.

474
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,135
You just gotten here.

475
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,637
Hey, i know.
But i gotta go.

476
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,901
What's that painting
mean to you?

477
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,907
Nothing. I just reminds me
of david hockey.

478
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,429
You want somethin'
to munch on?

479
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,431
What, are you
fuckin' kidding me?

480
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,435
You know, most guys i know
would be happy to get rid
of their wife.

481
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,687
I tried explainin'
the realities here.

482
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,690
This guy's as stubborn
as a fuckin' mule.

483
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,193
He says it's principle.

484
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,195
I think we gotta--
you know.

485
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,197
That's why
we called you.

486
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,199
I promised
the father- in- law
i wouldn't.

487
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,202
I didn't know
what else to do.

488
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,708
You're a stupid motherfucker.
You know that?

489
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,710
I've heard it said.

490
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,712
What,
are you proud of it?

491
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:02,717
You kill me,
and a dark cloud
goes over shlomo's house.

492
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:07,222
Either way,
there'll be no get
unless restitution is made.

493
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:11,226
You really would let me
kill you, wouldn't you,
you sick fuck?

494
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,230
You ever heard
of the masada?

495
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,732
For two years...

496
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,235
900 jews
held their own...

497
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,738
against 15, 000
roman soldiers.

498
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,742
They chose death
before enslavement.

499
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,246
And the romans,
where are they now?

500
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,250
You're lookin' at'em,
asshole.

501
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:43,258
"Yea, though i walk
through the valley
of the shadow of death,

502
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,261
i fear no evil,
for thou art with me."

503
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,263
Yeah. Hold that thought.

504
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,110
Yeah?
Hesh.

505
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,114
I'm here with my
non- shellfish- eatin' friend,
and i'm tapped out.

506
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,117
This guy won't
listen to reason.

507
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:13,121
Didn't i tell ya, huh?
Didn't i warn you to keep
away from those fanatics?

508
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:17,625
He's leavin' me no options.
This man's willing
to go down with the ship.

509
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,628
Well, here's a thought.

510
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,631
Maybe he's willing to go
to the world to come,

511
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,634
but if he's stuck here
on this earth...

512
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,637
i know one thing
that no man wants
to go through life without.

513
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,639
What?

514
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,142
Oh.

515
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,644
That's a fuckin'
brilliant idea.

516
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,147
Make like amohel, huh?

517
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,149
Finish his bris.

518
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,151
Yeah.

519
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:48,156
Paulie, get the bolt cutters
from out of the trunk.

520
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,159
Ariel,
we're goin' to plan "b."

521
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:53,795
The phone has been ringing
all morning.

522
00:31:53,795 --> 00:31:56,798
The rotellis, the trillos--
he's got something to do
with computers.

523
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:59,801
They're a wonderful couple.
She invited us to brunch.

524
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:02,303
Really?
Yep.

525
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:04,305
But it was the food,
mainie.

526
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:06,307
Everybody raved about it.

527
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:09,310
Cynthia ricci said,
"oh, i just love those
little rice balls,"

528
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,813
like she never had
arancin' before.

529
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:15,817
I couldn't have done it
without you.

530
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:21,322
It meant so much
just having you here.
It made it so much fun for me.

531
00:32:21,322 --> 00:32:24,325
Mainie, is somethin' wrong?
You got somethin' on your mind
or somethin'?

532
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:26,828
What could be wrong?

533
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:29,831
Listen, sweetie,

534
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:34,335
i know it may not seem like it
right now, but you guys'll
get back on your feet again.

535
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:37,839
Carmela,
i'm fine where i am.

536
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,842
I know.
That's not what i meant, i--

537
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,712
carmela, i never wanted
to tell you this.

538
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,714
It happened
so long ago.

539
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:50,101
You and tony,
you weren't even married.

540
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:54,105
- It's probably silly for me
to even bring it up now.
- What?

541
00:32:56,107 --> 00:33:00,111
You were down at the shore
with your parents that summer.
You and tony were on the outs.

542
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,613
- He called me.
- He did?

543
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:06,617
One thing led to another,
we started dating each other--

544
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:09,120
carmela, i slept with him.

545
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,623
You slept with t--
with tony?

546
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:16,127
Really, it wasn't for me.

547
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,629
Carmela,
what i'm trying to say is,

548
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,631
stop worrying about me.

549
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:23,634
Really.
We both made our choices.

550
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,636
I'm fine with mine.

551
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:48,910
I'd like you to consider this.
I'm disgusted with you.
Don't try to give me that.

552
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,914
Why'd you page me?
This fuckin' guy's tryin'
to pull some bullshit, tony.

553
00:33:52,914 --> 00:33:55,917
Hey, zz top.
The guy gave you
the get, didn't he?

554
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:57,919
But not because of you.

555
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,921
You threatened him
with castration,

556
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:02,924
but it was business
that brought him around.

557
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:06,427
He wanted 50 percent,
you wanted 25 percent,
so i split the difference.

558
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:10,932
I gave him 15 percent,
he gives my daughter
the divorce, and, uh--

559
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:12,934
it's business.
It worked out.

560
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:14,936
Walk with me,"shmolo."
Yes.

561
00:34:15,436 --> 00:34:16,938
Listen, don't worry.

562
00:34:17,438 --> 00:34:19,941
I- i've taken
good care of you.
Here.

563
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:22,944
W- what's that?
For your considerable
trouble.

564
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:25,446
As the talmud says--

565
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:28,950
i don't give a shit
what he says.

566
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,952
Now you listen to me.

567
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:33,955
You wanna give
your son- in- law 15 percent
of the motel? Go ahead.

568
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:35,957
It comes out
of your end.

569
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:39,460
Now, we got you your get,
you get us our 25 percent.
Got it?

570
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,462
My son was right.
Yeah?

571
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:43,965
You're mud,
godless clay--

572
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:48,469
i created
a living golem!

573
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:50,471
What the fuck
is a golem?

574
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:52,473
It's a monster!
Frankenstein!

575
00:34:52,473 --> 00:34:54,475
Get the fuck outta here,

576
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:57,478
before i take
that asshole son of yours
and shove him up your ass!

577
00:34:57,478 --> 00:34:59,981
Shut up!

578
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,244
Hey.

579
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,746
Hey, how ya doin'?

580
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,249
One second.

581
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,371
Got some good news.
We're in the motel business.

582
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,873
How do you like that?

583
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:33,514
Read this.

584
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:39,020
102. 7.

585
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:43,524
Maybe they should
take my temperature
with the other machine.

586
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:48,146
- Paulie thinks he broke
his hand on the guy's head.
- Digital.

587
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:51,782
- We're threatening
to cut his dick off.
- I should call the nurse.

588
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,902
He's mumblin' and prayin',
i'm tryin' to get
his pants off--

589
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,155
i think they should
take my temperature again.

590
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,907
Yeah, yeah, call'em.

591
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,811
Poor jackie.

592
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,815
God has his reasons.

593
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,935
Livia, he looked
twice as old as me.

594
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,938
So, what's really
on your mind, corrado?

595
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,941
This christopher moltisanti.

596
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,827
Christopher.
What about him?

597
00:36:37,078 --> 00:36:39,580
Him and his little,
uh,"friend,"

598
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,083
they're slappin' me
in the face...

599
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:44,085
and they're hiding
behind tony.

600
00:36:44,085 --> 00:36:48,089
Well, tony always
loved christopher like a son,

601
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:50,591
and so do i, junior.

602
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:54,095
He put up my storm windows
for me one year.

603
00:36:56,097 --> 00:36:58,099
Good.

604
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:05,606
But what do i do?

605
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:09,610
I just let him
and this filone kid
piss on me in public?

606
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,612
And how far do i go...

607
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:15,116
before i light a friggin' match
under that hotheaded son
of yours?

608
00:37:17,618 --> 00:37:21,122
Maybe christopher
could use a little talking to.

609
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:23,624
You know.

610
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:27,128
The other one, filone...

611
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:34,635
i don't know.

612
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,511
You got a lot of sense
for an old gal.

613
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,513
No.

614
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,015
I'm a babbling idiot.

615
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:51,519
That's why my son
put me in a nursing home.

616
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,990
He didn't even care
i was there.

617
00:37:57,491 --> 00:38:00,494
It was just him
and that fuckin' cancer.

618
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:06,000
It's like
he's already gone.

619
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,002
Yes.

620
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:13,007
Ehh.

621
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:20,014
Somebody called me
a frankenstein today.

622
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:22,016
Really?

623
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:24,518
This hasid
i'm doin' business with.

624
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,522
These hasids,
they're out there,

625
00:38:29,023 --> 00:38:31,525
but they got their beliefs,
you know.

626
00:38:33,027 --> 00:38:35,029
They're not afraid
of death.

627
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,647
At least
this one guy wasn't.

628
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,151
Maybe they have the belief
because they are afraid.

629
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,653
I'm not afraid of death.

630
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,655
Not if it's...

631
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,657
for somethin'.

632
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,660
You know, a war,
somethin' like that.

633
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,662
A reason.

634
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,664
But jackie--

635
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,666
to see this--

636
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,670
this strong,
beautiful man...

637
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,674
just wither away
to nothin'.

638
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,182
And you can't do nothin'
about it.

639
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,184
And you--

640
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,186
you can't fight it.

641
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,189
Do you envy the hasids
and their beliefs?

642
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,691
All this shit's for nothin'.

643
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,198
And if all this shit's
for nothin',
why do i gotta think about it?

644
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,200
That's the mystery,
isn't it?

645
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:35,206
The mystery of god,
or whatever
you want to call it,

646
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:41,212
of why we're given
the questionable gift
of knowing we're gonna die.

647
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:52,223
Do you feel
like frankenstein?

648
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:57,111
A thing...

649
00:39:57,111 --> 00:39:59,864
lacking humanity,

650
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,867
lacking human feelings?

651
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:40,654
Say hello to freddy,
all right?

652
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:51,665
You fuck--

653
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,806
listen, you're friends
of tony's, right?

654
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,808
Listen, meadow
wanted the crystal.

655
