1
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,914
So, you know...
usual girl stuff.

2
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,917
She picks up the dry cleaning.
She does the food shopping.

3
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,420
By the way,
your dr. Melfi
has excellent taste.

4
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,423
She only shops at
the fancy- shmancy deli--

5
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:07,427
the kind with the italian name
but you can't find a fuckin'
meatball in the whole joint.

6
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,429
What else?

7
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:13,433
I don't even know what i'm
supposed to be lookin' for.
What's up with this cooze?

8
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:18,438
It's none of your fuckin'
business. You're on a strict
need- to- know, lieutenant.

9
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,941
I oughta knock the shit
outta ya for what you did
to her date last month.

10
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,445
What? I figure this girl
is somegoomahof yours,
so i scare him a little.

11
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,947
What's the big deal?

12
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,453
This guy
still come around?
No.
He's not her type.

13
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:37,457
I told ya, he's a coward.
He nearly pissed himself.

14
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,959
All right, anything else?
I don't wanna be here all day.

15
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,463
Yesterday--
yesterday she got off at 9:00
and she went to bed early.

16
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,467
That's it?
That's it.

17
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,971
Here.
Buy yourself an iron.

18
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,613
You ready?

19
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,618
Decaf, right?

20
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:14,627
So, how was your college trip
with your daughter?

21
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,130
Tell ya, my life,
it's like, uh,

22
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,632
episode of
provolone somethin'.

23
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:24,137
- What's goin' on?
- My wife. All we do is fight.

24
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,140
Can you believe it?
She's jealous of you.

25
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:32,011
Is that something that you feel,
or has there been some
discussion with carmela?

26
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,147
She didn't know
you were a girl.

27
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,650
You know, a woman.

28
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,154
Excuse me, a doctor.
Woman doctor.

29
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,657
Why did it take you
so long to tell her?
I didn't tell her.

30
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:47,410
You spilled the beans
when you called
to change the appointment.

31
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,031
Let me ask you a different
question. Why a female?
Why a female doctor?

32
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:54,417
You know, she asked
the same friggin' question.

33
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:56,920
I sometimes wonder myself.

34
00:03:57,287 --> 00:03:59,789
And?
I'll tell you
what i told her.

35
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,793
Cusomano gave me a choice
between two jewish guys
and apaisanlike me.

36
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:07,297
- I picked thepaisan.
- What's the one thing
every woman--

37
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:10,300
your mother, your wife,
your daughter--
have in common?

38
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,937
- They all break my balls.
-

39
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:18,191
no, i know what you mean.
They're all italian. So what?

40
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:22,061
So maybe by
coming clean with me,
you're dialoguing with them.

41
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:24,447
Let me ask you a question.

42
00:04:25,448 --> 00:04:28,451
Why do you have me
as a patient?

43
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:33,456
Most legit people, they'd go a
hundred miles out of their way
not to make eye contact with me.

44
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:36,459
But you--
you didn't flinch.

45
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,642
The water's warm.
Come on in.

46
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:54,644
Hey, sammy.
How are you?

47
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:58,648
Just in time.
I was just gonna
make some coffee.

48
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:00,650
Yeah?
How's junior?

49
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,022
Sit the fuck down!
Down!

50
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:11,027
That's how junior is, sammy.

51
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:13,029
I'm with
little jimmy altieri.

52
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:16,032
Yeah? You payin' jimmy
for this game?

53
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:18,534
Huh, sammy?
No.

54
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:21,537
Are you payin'someone
for this game?

55
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:23,539
Huh?

56
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:25,174
Aah!

57
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:28,678
The party's over.

58
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:34,183
Junior soprano is the new boss
and he ain't respectin'
old arrangements.

59
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:37,186
You're lucky.
You stayed slim.

60
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:41,190
You can buy
right off the rack.

61
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,695
I wanted something special.
The boys are having
a little time for me.

62
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,815
You're wearin'
the suit to
the dinner, eh?

63
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,818
These guys today,
they want to be buried
in their joggin' outfit.

64
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,824
So how's your, uh--
what's your
oldest boy's name?

65
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,829
Rafaelle. Ralphie.
Yeah. Good kid.

66
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,832
Yeah.
He lost his son, you know.

67
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,969
- What do you mean, lost?
- Dead. Morte.

68
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:16,476
Ah, just a--
just a fucking kid.

69
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,594
A baby.

70
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:22,598
Oh, what are we
talkin' about here?
You lost your grandson?

71
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,852
What are you gonna do?
These fucking animals.

72
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,855
These--
these drug dealers.

73
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:31,240
The little kid used to run
around here breakin' balls.

74
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,495
Domonique.
My namesake.

75
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:39,365
Did you know about this?

76
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,502
See? What'd i say
about this fucking poison?

77
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,004
These kids
shouldn't touch it.

78
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:49,759
I read the paper every day
about these poor pricks
overdosin'.

79
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,514
He didn't overdose.
He killed himself.
Fourteen years old.

80
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,017
Jesus!
Was this at
patterson falls?

81
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:02,138
- Holy shit!
That was your grandson?
- Why?

82
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:04,640
The kid, he took one of those
designer drugs, right?

83
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:08,144
Goes to the falls,
takes a header
right off the fence.

84
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:12,148
They said the current whirled
so much that his head was
bashin' on the rocks for days...

85
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,901
before he even came up.

86
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,905
And meanwhile,
this piece of shit...

87
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:24,410
he gets to walk the streets
and sell more of this stuff
to young kids.

88
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,913
Oh, really?

89
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,415
What's this
motherless fuck's name?

90
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,423
Even the coffee's old in here.
How much complaining
can you do?

91
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,926
Eventually they find you
with a broken hip.

92
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,930
I want to make a gift of
a maganet. That's the only
way you'll get good coffee.

93
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,434
What are you wearing?
You smell like a frenchputa.

94
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,070
It's canoe.
Johnny wore canoe.

95
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,575
Morning, livia.
Oh, good morning.

96
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,577
Morning.
Hi.

97
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,946
New arrival?
Keep moving, fella.

98
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,586
I'm happy for you, junior.

99
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,590
I know how long you waited
to be made boss.

100
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,595
Just don't let certain people
take advantage of your good
nature like they did to johnny.

101
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,598
What certain people?
Nobody got over on johnny.

102
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,601
Nobody's gonna
get over on me.

103
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,604
How's your jewish friend?

104
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:29,108
- Hesh? What about him?
- Who ever heard of a jew
riding horses?

105
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:31,727
- He owns a horse farm.
- Aahh!

106
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:36,232
He's tony's friend, not mine.
What do you got
against him anyway?

107
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:39,235
Who, me? Nothing.

108
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:43,739
Johnny liked him, and my son
thinks that every word
that comes out of his mouth...

109
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:45,741
is pure gold.

110
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:51,247
Are you tellin' me that
since i'm the new boss
i should tax hesh?

111
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,252
Heh!

112
00:08:56,752 --> 00:09:00,756
Boy, anthony must've really
gotten under your collar.
Admit it.

113
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:03,759
You're lookin'
to crack hiscalione
for puttin' you in here.

114
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:06,896
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.
Yeah.

115
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:10,266
And i'm playin'
shortstop for the mets.

116
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,770
Oh, all right,
watch the balls!

117
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:29,285
What is the matter?

118
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:31,787
Tony's cannoli doesn't want
to stand up?

119
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:34,790
Tony's cannoli's tired.

120
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,293
But i can make it
happen, baby.

121
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:40,796
I know.
It's just, maybe--

122
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,801
so how's your job?

123
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:48,804
Huh?
Since when do you
care about my job?

124
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:51,307
Can't i be nice?

125
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:55,811
All right. Forget it.

126
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:58,314
Mmm.

127
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:01,067
Okay, you don't want to talk
about your job? Fine.

128
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,570
Here. Tell somebody
who gives a fuck.

129
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,075
I'm not a fucking whore!
Stick your money up your ass.

130
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:12,078
I don't know
what's wrong with you,
but don't take it out on me.

131
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,581
Hey, there's nothing wrong
with me! Just wanted
to talk, that's all.

132
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,584
For all the conversation
i get around here, i might
as well be a fuckin' dildo!

133
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:22,588
If you were a dildo,
we wouldn't be fighting.

134
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:26,475
What does that mean?
Huh, you fuckin' refugee?
What does that mean?

135
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:29,478
- Aah!
-

136
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:31,981
come here!

137
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:33,983
Knock you out,
you fuckin' communist cunt!

138
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:35,985
Hey, hey, hey!

139
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:41,991
Yeah, same to you!

140
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:44,994
You fuckin' burned me!

141
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,248
Angela.

142
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,753
What do you got, andrea?

143
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,013
Clabby?
Hearts.

144
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:08,017
Jump in,
the water's warm.
Child's play.

145
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:10,019
Pound a point.

146
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:16,525
Hesh is outside.
Tell him to come in.

147
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:20,029
He says he needs
a word with you.

148
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:23,032
What the fuck.
I've eaten more queens
than lancelot.

149
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,791
What's up?

150
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,793
Let's walk.
That serious?

151
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,297
You spoke to
your uncle lately?

152
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,300
Junior? Yeah.

153
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,804
No.
I don't know.
Why? What's up?

154
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,806
Your father was
a fair man, tony.

155
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:50,810
What's that got to do
with junior?
Junior's not so fair.

156
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,312
Sometimes i wish
you'd just get to
the fuckin' point.

157
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,314
What'd he do?

158
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,817
He's taxing me,
tony.

159
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,319
He's taxing you?
When did this happen?

160
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,322
Today.
Did you tell him you operated
for years without any tax?

161
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,325
That my father loved you
and respected you?

162
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,695
That ten cents
out of every dollar
that goes into his kick...

163
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,581
is directly related
to your shylock business?

164
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:17,086
My uncle's been boss of
the family ten fuckin' minutes,
already i gotagita.

165
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,705
What'd you tell him?
Told him the truth.

166
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:23,209
It's a reasonable request
but an unreasonable figure.
Back up a minute.

167
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,712
What do you mean,
"it's a reasonable request"?
He's the boss now.

168
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:30,716
He can call the tune, we all
dance to it. That's the way
it's always been done.

169
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:34,220
You can either respect
what's been done in the past
or change the rules.

170
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,724
Look, tony, the reason
i came over here was to tell you
with all this bullshit goin' on,

171
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,977
i don't know if i can
stay in this area.
Where you gonna go?

172
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:46,482
Hey, come on. I can sit on my
royalty checks. You forget
i wrote six gold records.

173
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:48,984
No, a couple of black kids
wrote six gold records.

174
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:51,987
You owned the company.
You gave yourself a co- writing
credit. Come on, hesh.

175
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:54,990
Besides, i know you.

176
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,493
You leave this action,
you're gonna kill yourself.

177
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:01,997
How much does he want?
Five hundred large,

178
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:05,000
plus two points monthly
on my shy.

179
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:09,505
Hm! All right.

180
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:12,508
Do me a favor.
Sit tight for now.

181
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:15,010
Let me think about it
for a while.

182
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,321
How was that, baby?

183
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,823
The best.

184
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,826
You are the best.

185
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,330
Come here.

186
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,335
Tony, i love your cannoli.

187
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,839
You okay?

188
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,841
Yeah, i'm okay.

189
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,344
Go back to your sleep.

190
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,100
Sure you're all right?

191
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:54,610
So, what do you want
new york to do?

192
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,112
First of all,
junior can't know
that we talked.

193
00:14:57,112 --> 00:15:00,115
He's gotta think
hesh came to you
on his own by himself.

194
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:05,120
You are still
runnin' things.

195
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,625
Another thing,
the arrangement, whatever it is,
can't be insulting to my uncle.

196
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,127
Hesh's gotta pay
somethin',

197
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,129
i just haven't
decided what.

198
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:23,138
I gotta get back.
We'll talk later.

199
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:31,146
How's the veal?

200
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:34,650
It's like rubber.
Yeah?

201
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:42,658
Tastes all right to me.
Want somethin' else?

202
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:46,211
No.

203
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,093
Hm.
Don't look at me.

204
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,595
Compliments of johnny sack.

205
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,237
Maybe you'd like to spend
the rest of our anniversary
with him.

206
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:16,742
I was over there for
ten friggin' minutes, carmela.
Don't do this.

207
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,746
All right, tony.
At least i know
where i stand.

208
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,252
Why you always gotta be
so dramatic, huh?

209
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,254
Here we go.
Huh!

210
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,257
All right, i'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

211
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,260
You don't even know what
you're apologizing for.

212
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,765
It's our anniversary, tony.
Ours.

213
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:43,769
Not yours, mine
and johnny fuckin' sacks'.
Ours.

214
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,272
Here i was thinkin' maybe we
could get a room at the plaza
like last year, or--

215
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,274
i don't know.
I do--

216
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,786
i'm sorry, carmela.

217
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,288
Huh?

218
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:07,292
I just got a lot on my mind,
and i'm not thinkin' straight.

219
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:13,298
Hey. I'm sorry.

220
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:21,306
Should i call the plaza?
Come on.

221
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,928
Nah, let's go home.

222
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:39,942
Hey, come here.

223
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:43,445
Carmela, what do you
want me to say?
I'm lost at sea here.

224
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:47,950
You've changed, tony,
and i resent it.

225
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,454
I resent it because it's
destroying what little
self- esteem i have left.

226
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:56,458
I swear, sometimes i think
you skeeve me.
I skeeve you?

227
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,461
You're the mother
of my children.
How the fuck did i skeeve you?

228
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:01,964
You see what
i'm talkin' about?
Right there.

229
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:03,966
"You're the mother
of my children."

230
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:07,970
I feel like i'm just
someone you've chosen
to procreate with.

231
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,973
You knew this might happen
with the prozac.

232
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:12,975
Ginny torrelli's
been on it for years
and she'd hump a fire hydrant...

233
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:16,478
if it could make a pass at her.
Dr. Melfi told me it affects
different people different ways.

234
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:18,981
Oh. She told you that?

235
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:38,000
I think before we start
today's session,

236
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,502
we need to address
the coffee situation.

237
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:44,506
It's not appropriate
of me to take gifts.

238
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:49,011
- It's a cup of coffee.
- Let's just make a rule, okay?
No gifts.

239
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:54,016
This mean i can't
drink mine?

240
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:56,018
No, no.

241
00:18:56,018 --> 00:19:00,022
I'm sorry. I usually have
my answering service on
when i have a patient,

242
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:02,524
but i have
a car emergency.

243
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:04,526
Yes?

244
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:08,030
What does that mean,
"diagnostic"?

245
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:12,534
I just wanna know
what's wrong with my car.

246
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,420
No.
No, don't do anything.

247
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,923
No, i want to get
a second opinion.

248
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,928
I'll-- i'll take my chances.
Thank you.

249
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,933
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

250
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,935
It's all right.

251
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,938
So...how's it goin'?

252
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,941
Good. Real good.

253
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,444
As a matter of fact,
i think i may flush
the medication.

254
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,948
You know? See if the changes
i'm feelin' are for real.

255
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:46,068
Why would you do that?
The prozac seems to be working.

256
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:50,455
Well, that might be the problem.
It might be workin'
a little overtime.

257
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,457
What do you mean?

258
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,459
Umm--

259
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,331
- i'm havin' a, uh--
- reaction?

260
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,967
You know.
A side effect from the stuff.

261
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,336
We talked about that
when you started.

262
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,472
Some people get insomnia;

263
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,842
others a stomach ache
or headaches.

264
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:16,481
- But it usually passes.
- Are there any other side
effects that you know of?

265
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,851
Some people experience
a diminished libido.

266
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:24,239
- They have a hard time
getting or maintaining a--
- bingo.

267
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:26,742
I see.
Mm.

268
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:29,745
You know, not all impotence
is a result of the medication.

269
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:32,247
You sayin' there's
somethin' wrong with me?

270
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:34,249
When's the last time
you had a prostate exam?

271
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:37,119
Hey, i don't even let anybody
wag their finger in myface!

272
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:43,008
I'm sorry,
i shouldn't have laughed!

273
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,510
- Don't apologize.
- Oh, boy.

274
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:49,264
- You got a nice laugh.
- All right, let's be serious.

275
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,267
Hey, i'm serious.

276
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:58,774
You know that depression
is also a leading factor
in impotence.

277
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:03,278
When you awaken in the morning
or in the middle of the night,
do you ever have an erection?

278
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:09,034
- You could set your clock to it.
- Okay, so we know it's not
a physical problem.

279
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:19,795
Let's put that in
after the credenza.
Yes, ma'am.

280
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:23,799
You wanna tell me
what's goin' on?

281
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:26,802
I bought some furniture.

282
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:29,304
Why don't we just
move into roche bobois?
Save the delivery charge.

283
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:31,807
Fine.
I'll send it back.

284
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:33,809
No, but you've been spendin'
like a drunken sailor
all last week.

285
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:36,311
I said
i'll send it back.

286
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:38,814
Mother of christ, carmela,
i didn't say that, did i?

287
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:40,816
Jesus.

288
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,986
All due respect to new york,

289
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:46,488
i don't think you should be
tellin' my uncle
how to run things.

290
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:48,490
You think i got the balls
to drive in from new york...

291
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,493
and tell your uncle
how he should run
his family?

292
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:56,999
I shouldn't expect to see
the statue of liberty again
if i did that, huh?

293
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,252
- All right, look, tony. -

294
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:04,256
hesh isn't only
a friend of you guys.
He's a friend of ours.

295
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:09,261
Somebody has to step in
so he doesn't get fucked.
I never said fucked.

296
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:12,381
And you.
Frankly, i'm a little hurt.
You should've come to me first.

297
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:15,767
- Airin' your dirty laundry
in public.
- Junior knew how i felt.

298
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,270
How would it look if i went
to you after i spoke to him?
He's got a point.

299
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:24,893
Bottom line is,
what're we gonna do about this?

300
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,533
Somethin' tells me you
have a suggestion.

301
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,904
Junior,
if there're any flies on you,
they're payin' fuckin' rent.

302
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,161
Five hundred is a little steep
for back taxes, no?

303
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,415
As far as two percent
of his action,
that's up to you to settle.

304
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:50,802
After all, that affects tony
as much as hesh.

305
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:53,422
I'm not out to hurt anyone.

306
00:22:53,422 --> 00:22:56,925
God forbid i get in the way
of someone earning.

307
00:22:57,426 --> 00:23:00,429
Let's say one and a half
on the shy business
and 300 on the back tax.

308
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:03,432
Two fifty.

309
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:10,939
What'd i tell ya? Hold onto
your cock when you negotiate
with these desert people.

310
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:16,445
Two fifty.

311
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:18,580
All right.

312
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,972
Mr. Soprano.

313
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,734
You want sex?
No.

314
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,372
Go back to sleep.

315
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:15,887
You know, you have a nice body.
You ought to make it
work for you more.

316
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:19,891
Oh, really?
You reveal too much.

317
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:22,894
You don't want other men
looking at me?

318
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:25,013
No.
When you're not with me
you do what you want.

319
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:30,018
But i'm sayin' maybe
you could wear a nice,
businesslike outfit.

320
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,404
I think i could
get into that.

321
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,406
You want me to dress
like a man?
No.

322
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,776
No, you fuckin' wack- a- doo,
i don't want you to dress
like a man.

323
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:41,780
I'm just sayin',
maybe wear somethin'
a little more professional.

324
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,417
You know,
like you're in business.
Fuck you. I'm no whore.

325
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:49,921
No. That's not what i mean.
Not like you're in
the whore business.

326
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,923
Oh, forget it.

327
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,795
Come here.

328
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:03,685
Is everybody in my life
bananas or what?

329
00:25:06,188 --> 00:25:08,440
Get over here!

330
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,944
Come here.
Go jerk off.

331
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,447
Yeah.
Go jerk off.

332
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,949
Look at this.
She burned me.

333
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,452
That's not good.

334
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,454
What led up to that?

335
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:26,324
Carmela can be
pretty violent sometimes.

336
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:29,327
This added problem
that i've been havin'
that we talked about--

337
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:33,331
i just thought that maybe
we needed to spice things up
a little bit. You know?

338
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,834
If it's not the prozac,

339
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:39,337
then maybe i just needed
a little jump start.

340
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,340
So i suggest to her that maybe
she dress a little differently.

341
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,845
Something titillating.
Yeah.
You know, maybe it'd help.

342
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,848
So i suggested to her--

343
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,850
not demanded--

344
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,852
suggested--

345
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,855
you know, maybe dress
a little sexier.

346
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,357
But carmela
can be very sensitive.

347
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,360
Maybe she felt
it degraded her.

348
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,863
Not all women
are into sexy lingerie.

349
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,365
I'm not talkin' about
dressin' like that.

350
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,868
Then what are we
talking about?

351
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:13,371
Some women are sexier
when they dress simple.

352
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,373
You know, understated.

353
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,877
I don't mean--

354
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,883
fuck it.
I don't know what i mean.

355
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,388
Like you.

356
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,390
How like me?

357
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,392
You play it down.

358
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:42,901
Now, it's obvious you got
a killer body under there.
Don't get me wrong.

359
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,903
All right.

360
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,405
Not only do you
play it down,

361
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,409
but you're gentle.

362
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,912
Not loud.

363
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,914
Sweet sounding...

364
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,418
like a mandolin.

365
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,425
Anthony--

366
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,936
it's unfortunate that
we have to stop now,

367
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,939
because i think
it's really important
we talk about this.

368
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:24,943
Do you think you could
come back later
this afternoon?

369
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,945
No.

370
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,450
Till tuesday.

371
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,454
Okay?

372
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,461
Yeah, all right.

373
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,463
See you tuesday.

374
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:13,124
Oh, motherfucker!

375
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,128
Ow.

376
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,130
Shit!

377
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,866
It's the oddest thing.
I've had this problem for weeks,

378
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:58,870
but this morning i get in
and it starts right up.

379
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,373
- And then again at the deli.
- Uh, looks fine.

380
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,376
Are you sure?
I was told i need a new starter.

381
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:11,382
Lady, as much as
i might wish to rob you...

382
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,885
even i wouldn't try to replace
a new starter with another.

383
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:19,274
- What do you mean "new"?
- New. It has everything but
the price tag hanging from it.

384
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:28,316
Come on, mikey!
I didn't do nothin'!

385
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:30,819
Poor kid
committed suicide
up here'cause of you.

386
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:33,705
You fuckin' know me!
Yeah, i know ya.

387
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:40,578
Now listen to me.
I'm gonna give ya a break.

388
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,581
When i toss ya over--
no!

389
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,585
If you can fly
i won't shoot you down.
Deal?

390
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,472
No!
Son of a bitch.

391
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,749
My goodness.

392
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,751
What happened here?

393
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:27,759
It's some sad shit.
Motherfucker said he didn't
want to live no more.

394
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,761
He jumped.

395
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,636
How much he give you?

396
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:55,036
I thought i was the only one
junior could make look
like that.

397
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:01,910
All right.
Let me hear it.

398
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:06,414
Rusty irish.
What about him?

399
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:10,919
He took a header off the falls.
That's the closest that
junkie fuck ever got to a bath.

400
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:14,422
I got news for you.
That junkie fuck
was my biggest earner.

401
00:31:14,422 --> 00:31:17,926
During the football season
he moved more cards
than ten guys put together.

402
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:21,062
And another thing.
A certain friend of ours
should've checked with me...

403
00:31:21,062 --> 00:31:24,315
before he did a favor
for the old man capri.

404
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:28,186
You're losin' me.
Irish was the one who sold
capri's grandson that shit.

405
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,822
I think you created
a fuckin' frankenstein
in junior.

406
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,324
I created?

407
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,827
We all agreed to let
junior have his day.

408
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,831
Let him be the lightning rod.
When lightning strikes, god
forbid, and somebody goes down,

409
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,333
it's not a young man
with a family, remember?

410
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,837
- We all agreed.
- Yeah, but who expected
to get raped?

411
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:50,208
When jackie was acting boss no
one minded, 'cause it all evened
out at the end of the day.

412
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,211
But your uncle-- marone!
Doesheeat alone.

413
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,214
He doesn't even
pass the salt.
Heh heh.

414
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,216
What about that
sammy grigio card game?

415
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,219
That fuckin' mikey
smacked him around.
That ain't right.

416
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,222
Come on, jimmy.
Even a broken clock
is right twice a day.

417
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:07,725
Junior was right.
He had a position.
That game wasn't payin' anybody.

418
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:12,230
The minute sammy grigio used
jimmy's name, it should've
been end of story.

419
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,734
- That's right.
-

420
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:20,238
what do you want me to do?
We made our bed. We sleep
in it. We're all men.

421
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:23,241
But how long we gonna
continue to kick upstairs
without it hurtin'?

422
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,244
I mean something, anything,
should trickle down over here,
no?

423
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:31,883
All we want you to do
is talk to him.
After all, he's your uncle.

424
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,636
- Come on.
- That's right.

425
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:50,151
Who is it?
It's me, ma.

426
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:52,654
Who?
Anthony.

427
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:56,157
Open the door.

428
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:03,164
I thought you were
the activities lady.
Hey.

429
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:05,166
She's a real pain
in the ass.

430
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:09,170
Playing bingo,
livia?
Not tonight,
honey.

431
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,673
You know, she's a
degenerate gambler.

432
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:14,175
Uh, millie?
Millie?

433
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:16,177
Hmm?
My son.

434
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,681
Handsome.

435
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,692
So how's it goin'?

436
00:33:30,692 --> 00:33:33,194
Oh, what can i say?

437
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:35,196
Hey, this is great.

438
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:38,700
The only thing that's missin'
is that broken readin' lamp
you had by the phone.

439
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,202
I got it downstairs.
I can bring it if you want.

440
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,705
Shh, shh, shh.
Listen.

441
00:33:44,205 --> 00:33:46,708
Oh, she's
driving me crazy.
Who?

442
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:50,211
Next door!
There it is again.

443
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,213
Oh!

444
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:55,717
That's enough water!
How much water
does she need?

445
00:33:56,217 --> 00:34:00,722
She runs
the water all day.
Water, water, water!

446
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:04,726
I'm livin' next door
to gunga din!

447
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:08,229
I went down to ferrara's.
I got you some biscotti.
Almonds?

448
00:34:08,229 --> 00:34:10,732
Yeah.
All right.
Leave'em there.

449
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:14,235
I'll take'em
downstairs later
for my coffee.

450
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,745
Uncle jun been by?
Oh...once in a while.

451
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:26,247
It makes him
uncomfortable here.

452
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:30,752
He's got a lot on his mind.
More responsibilities
means more headaches.

453
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:34,255
Better men than him
had to work hard.
Yeah.

454
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:40,261
He'll be all right...
long as he remembers
who his friends are.

455
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:45,767
I'd just hate to see him mess
this up. He's been waitin'
a long time for the big chair.

456
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:50,772
What do you mean?
It's not a business that
forgives bad decisions.

457
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:53,775
I hate to see him making
wrong moves, you know?

458
00:34:53,775 --> 00:34:57,278
Especially at the start
of the game.
Why're you tellin' me?

459
00:34:57,278 --> 00:35:01,282
- Tell him.
- Ma...you got his ear.

460
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:03,284
He listens to you.

461
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:05,286
I don't know that world.

462
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:07,789
No, of course not.

463
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:11,292
But if anything, you know,
were to come up--
that's all.

464
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:13,795
I don't want
to get involved.

465
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:17,799
If you have something
to say to your uncle
then bring it up to him.

466
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,669
Oh, i wish the lord
would take me.

467
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,172
Come on, ma.

468
00:35:24,172 --> 00:35:28,676
There's probably plenty of gents
in this place that want a date
with a lovely woman like you.

469
00:35:29,177 --> 00:35:31,679
Look, i'm goin'
downstairs...

470
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,183
before that
activities lady finds me.

471
00:35:35,683 --> 00:35:37,185
You want coffee?

472
00:35:37,685 --> 00:35:39,687
Yeah, all right.
Bring my cookies!

473
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:43,191
Carmela, i don't
want to sound like...

474
00:35:43,191 --> 00:35:45,693
religion is a cure- all,

475
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:48,696
but i think if tony
got more involved
with the church...

476
00:35:48,696 --> 00:35:52,700
it may help to expedite
things in his therapy.

477
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,204
What's killing me
is this is
a self- inflicted wound.

478
00:35:56,204 --> 00:35:57,705
I pushed for it.

479
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,343
I could deal with thegoomahs.
I knew i was better than them.

480
00:36:02,343 --> 00:36:06,848
As stupid as it sounds,
i viewed them as a form
of masturbation for him.

481
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:10,351
I couldn't give him
what he needed all the time.

482
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:13,354
You're a man, father.
You know that thirst.

483
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:18,860
I was too busy with
the house and kids
to quench it.

484
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:26,367
But the psychiatrist--
you know, she's not
just agoomah.

485
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:29,370
For the first time i feel
like he's really cheating...

486
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,874
and i'm the one
who's thirsty.

487
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:36,377
I'm not gonna stay in
a marriage that's made--
shh. Shh.

488
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:39,380
Let's not even
think about that.

489
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,382
Divorce is for the weak,

490
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:44,886
for people who never
intended on dying married
in the first place.

491
00:36:47,388 --> 00:36:50,391
You know, carm,
we reap what we sow.

492
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:53,394
What do you mean?

493
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:58,399
You admit to accepting
his dalliances in the past.
They meant nothing to tony.

494
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:03,771
But you said
it was like they were
lightening the workload,

495
00:37:03,771 --> 00:37:07,775
providing a wife's duty
when you were too busy
with the kids and the house.

496
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:09,777
You practically
welcomed it.

497
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,533
I want you to pray
to our holy mother.

498
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:19,537
Ask her for guidance
and forgiveness...

499
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,540
so that you can get
through this as a couple.

500
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:28,045
You're not without sin
in this, carmela.

501
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:34,769
She's outta control.
She's spendin' money like we're
the sopranos of park avenue.

502
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:38,272
But you've noticed her,
which may have been
the point.

503
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:44,278
Look, before we
run out of time,

504
00:37:44,278 --> 00:37:49,150
i'd like to discuss
what happened when
we were here last week.

505
00:37:52,153 --> 00:37:54,405
How's your car?

506
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:59,293
Did you steal my car
and have it fixed?

507
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,798
We had an agreement:
No gifts.

508
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:06,300
I didn't want
to see you get robbed.

509
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:11,422
It was you.
You had no right
to steal my car.

510
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,427
- I've been scared to death.
- Why?

511
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:20,064
It's a violation of my privacy.
What else have you done?

512
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:25,686
Answer me.

513
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:30,191
I love you.

514
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:32,693
Anthony--
i'm in love with you.

515
00:38:34,195 --> 00:38:36,697
I'm sorry.
That's just the way it is.

516
00:38:37,198 --> 00:38:40,201
Okay, let me talk.
No.
It's not the prozac.

517
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:45,206
I dream about you.

518
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:47,708
I think about you
all the time.

519
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:50,211
I can't get excited
about any other women.

520
00:38:51,712 --> 00:38:53,714
There's nothing else
to say.

521
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:58,719
I love you.
Let me start here.

522
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,724
I know this may be
very hard for you
to swallow,

523
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:07,228
but you're only feeling
this way because we've
made such progress.

524
00:39:07,228 --> 00:39:10,231
What?
I've been gentle.
That's my job.

525
00:39:10,231 --> 00:39:14,735
I listen.
That's what i do best.

526
00:39:14,735 --> 00:39:18,239
I've been a broad, generic
sympathetic woman to you,

527
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,242
because that's what
this work calls for.

528
00:39:23,244 --> 00:39:27,748
You've made me all of
the things you feel are
missing in your wife...

529
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:30,251
and in your mother.

530
00:39:37,758 --> 00:39:41,762
You're makin' me out to be
some fuckin' mama's boy.

531
00:39:42,263 --> 00:39:46,267
I'm a man...
and you're a woman.

532
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:48,269
End of story.

533
00:39:48,269 --> 00:39:54,275
And this crap about freud
and every boy wanting to have
sex with his mother--

534
00:39:54,275 --> 00:39:56,277
that's not gonna fly here.

535
00:39:56,277 --> 00:39:59,280
I didn't say that.

536
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,782
I want to make sure we
understand each other.

537
00:40:01,782 --> 00:40:04,785
Yeah, we understand
each other.

538
00:40:06,787 --> 00:40:09,290
You don't love me.

539
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:16,297
You don't want me to come
back any more, fine.

540
00:40:16,297 --> 00:40:18,799
It's quite the opposite.

541
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:22,303
This is all a byproduct
of progress.

542
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:24,305
Has someone been
following me?

543
00:40:27,308 --> 00:40:29,310
Okay, forget it.

544
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,812
I'll see you next week.

545
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,074
All right! Let's go!

546
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,076
Move it!
Remember when you
used to tell me--

547
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:51,081
i always thought you could make
the pros. You coulda done it.
You had a swing like joe di.

548
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:54,585
You're crazy.
What, you think
i'm shittin' you?

549
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:58,088
Yeah, i could barely
hit. 250.
That's because
you didn't want it.

550
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:02,476
Too busy chasin' skirt.
Chasin' skirt,
your average was. 500.

551
00:41:02,977 --> 00:41:05,479
- Yeah, what happened?
- So what is it you want
to talk about?

552
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:11,986
Octavian.
You know, augustus.

553
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:16,490
You fuckin' with me?
No.
Octavian became augustus.

554
00:41:18,993 --> 00:41:21,495
Forget about that.
Bottom line:

555
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:24,999
Augustus was a caesar--
and everybody loved him,
right?

556
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:29,003
You know why?
I don't know
that i give a fuck.

557
00:41:29,003 --> 00:41:32,006
Everybody loved him
'cause he never ate alone.

558
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:36,510
Capisci?
It was the longest time
of peace in rome's history.

559
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:40,514
He was a fair leader,
and all his people
loved him for that.

560
00:41:40,514 --> 00:41:44,518
This the one that they
stabbed in the back?
No, that was julius.

561
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:49,523
I'm talkin' about augustus.
He shared his wealth,
and all his people loved him.

562
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:54,778
You said that three fuckin'
times. I heard it."his people
loved him." what's your point?

563
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:01,285
Remember the story you told me
about the father bull
talkin' to the son?

564
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:04,788
They're up on this hill.
They're lookin' down
on a bunch of cows.

565
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,291
The son goes to the father,

566
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,793
"dad, why don't we run
down there and fuck
one of these cows?"

567
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,546
You remember what
the father said?

568
00:42:12,546 --> 00:42:16,550
Father says,
"son, why don't we walk down
there and fuck'em all?"

569
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,053
I told you that?
Yeah!

570
00:42:19,553 --> 00:42:21,555
Why don't we
fuck'em all!

571
00:42:21,555 --> 00:42:24,058
That's funny.

572
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:27,561
Okay, i get your point.
Why don't you just
come out with it...

573
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:31,065
instead of all this
augustus- octavian shit?
I don't know.

574
00:42:31,565 --> 00:42:35,069
Are you okay?
You been actin'
mesamortelately.

575
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:38,072
I ain't seen
a long face like that
since you were a kid.

576
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:43,077
I'm okay. It's just,
uh...bullshit stuff.
Don't worry about it.

577
00:42:43,077 --> 00:42:47,081
You sure?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm okay.

578
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:54,705
Junior took the 250
you gave him and whacked it up
amongst the top five guys.

579
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:57,207
You know, so he doesn't
look greedy.
Smart move.

580
00:42:57,207 --> 00:43:00,210
Yeah.
Your uncle may turn out
to be another harry truman.

581
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,213
What's that mean?
Truman had a big job
thrust upon him.

582
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,216
He didn't want it,
but in the end he made
some pretty wise decisions.

583
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:10,220
So who knows?
Your uncle may turn out to be
the right man for the job.

584
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,225
I fuckin' hope so,
'cause i'll tell you right now,
i don't want the fuckin' job.

585
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:18,228
Let junior die
from the stress.

586
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:21,231
It's what gave
jackie the cancer,
god rest his soul.

587
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,734
"Boss."
Fuck it.
Who needs it?

588
00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:36,997
- It's nice here.
- I can't stand the smell.

589
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:39,500
Shit, flies all over
the place.

590
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,504
But i could stand here for hours
and watch'em run around.
There's a kind of beauty to it.

591
00:43:44,004 --> 00:43:47,007
I envy them.
I wouldn't go that far.

592
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:50,511
I would.
They got no bills,
no headaches,

593
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:52,513
no familycazies
runnin' around.

594
00:43:52,513 --> 00:43:55,516
One horse likes another horse,
they go up to each other,
they fuck. That's it.

595
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:59,520
No problems,
no hundred questions,
no guilt.

596
00:44:02,022 --> 00:44:04,525
I don't know what the fuck
i'm talkin' about.

597
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:08,028
So junior whacked up my money
and spread it around, huh?

598
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:09,530
Yeah.

599
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:13,167
Five bosses, 50 a pop.
Not a bad day's pay.

600
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:17,671
Still, i wish it
wasn't your money.

601
00:44:17,671 --> 00:44:20,424
You know, it makes me
feel terrible.

602
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,429
What?

603
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,935
You old fuckin' jew.
Here's my share.

604
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:34,938
You think i'm gonna
profit off your tax?

605
00:44:38,058 --> 00:44:40,060
Never entered my mind.

606
00:45:00,214 --> 00:45:03,217
Dr. Melfi--
there's nothin' there,
you know.

607
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:05,719
You don't have to
explain nothin',
tony.

608
00:45:08,222 --> 00:45:10,224
This psychiatry shit--

609
00:45:10,724 --> 00:45:13,227
apparently, what you're feelin'
is not what you're feelin',

610
00:45:13,227 --> 00:45:16,230
and what you're not feelin'
is your real agenda.

611
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,363
You're gonna stick with it,
right?
I don't know.

612
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,866
Think you should.

613
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:38,869
You do?
Uh- huh.

614
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,874
I was jealous.
I should've told you--

615
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,876
no, wait.
Let me finish, tony.

616
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,380
I've been thinkin'
a lot about this.

617
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,886
I was jealous of her ability
to help you--

618
00:45:57,387 --> 00:46:00,390
to be a sort of
salvation to you.

619
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,893
I talked to father phil,
and...

620
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,897
i wanna be that woman
in your life.

621
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:17,407
Carm, you aren't just
in my life.

622
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,409
You are my life.

623
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:26,416
Come here.

624
00:46:43,817 --> 00:46:45,819
Okay, i'm no good
at speeches.

625
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:48,939
Yeah,
you owe him a fuckin' dime,
you'll hear some great speeches.

626
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:52,326
- Shut up. Let me talk. -

627
00:46:52,326 --> 00:46:54,828
go ahead, talk.
I was only kiddin'. Go ahead.

628
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:57,698
I'd like everybody
to raise their glasses.

629
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:10,594
Okay, uh--

630
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:14,598
he taught me
as much as anybody,
'cept for maybe my father.

631
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,102
Even if he wasn't my uncle,

632
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,606
i'd be
standin' here sayin'...

633
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:26,109
- to our new boss, salud.
-

634
00:47:28,896 --> 00:47:31,532
to junior.

635
00:47:31,532 --> 00:47:33,283
Junior.

636
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:36,637
To junior.

637
00:47:36,637 --> 00:47:39,740
Salud.
