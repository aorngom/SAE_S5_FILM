1
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,618
Here, take a swig.
And don't backwash.

2
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:43,620
Shit!
Don't break it.

3
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,622
Quick, it's almost time
for the nuns' rosary.

4
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:47,624
This is eighth grade
history, man.

5
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:50,627
Stealing the sacramental wine?
It's not sacramental
till they bless it, moron.

6
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:53,129
All clear!
Are you gonna confess this?

7
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,632
I'm gonna tell them
i stole something,
not what!

8
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,253
Go! Form it up!
Form it up!
Let's go, boys!

9
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:02,505
Hustle, hustle,
hustle, hustle!

10
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:04,507
There we go.
Straight lines.

11
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:07,010
Straight lines.
There you go.

12
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,395
Come on, soprano, dicarlucci,
shake a leg.

13
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,898
Jumping jacks. Ten of them.
Count'em down.

14
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,901
One, two, three, four,
two, three,

15
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,905
five, six, seven, eight,
four, five, six, seven,

16
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:22,158
nine, ten.
Eight, nine, ten.

17
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,777
One, two, three, four,

18
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:28,531
five, six, seven, eight,
dicarlucci, barber, soprano,
let's go! Sync up!

19
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:32,535
- What's so funny, gentlemen?
You care to share?

20
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:36,172
Sorry, mr. Meskimmin.

21
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:42,045
Okay, kick- outs, boys.
Floor! Kick!

22
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:44,047
Return! Up!

23
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:47,050
I'm dizzier than shit.
Kick!

24
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,936
Return! Up!

25
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:51,554
Fuck.
Here he comes.

26
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:55,558
Floor. Kick. Turn. Up.

27
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,062
What's going on here?

28
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:03,449
Come on, stand up.
On your feet. Let's go.

29
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,455
Whoa.
Man!

30
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:13,076
- I don't feel so good.
- I don't want any excuses.

31
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:17,714
Mr. Meskimmin,
i gotta go to the bathroom.

32
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:20,333
Is that alcohol
on your breath?
Oh, no!

33
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:41,738
Hey, how's the boy?
How am i?

34
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:45,241
I got dust
up the crack of my ass,
and i'm starvin' to death.

35
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:48,745
You're doin' an excellent job.
Allow yourself
to take pleasure in that.

36
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:52,248
Guy's been raggin'
in my fuckin' ear all day.
I'd like to kill the prick.

37
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:54,250
You hear that, prick?
Get him outta here.

38
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,753
Just get him
the hell out of here!

39
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:59,756
Is there a problem?
Look, you made
your point, okay?

40
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:01,758
I made my point?
You made your point.

41
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:03,760
What point is that?
Enough with this
work stoppage.

42
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,262
This is a union safety official,
and he stays...

43
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,765
until the union
deems this workplace
is free of hazard.

44
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:11,267
I have the money.
You do?

45
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:13,770
Christopher,
give the union and call...

46
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,772
and see if this gentleman here
has paid up his union dues.

47
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:18,274
Then pop one
of these wheel covers.
We'll check the brake pads.

48
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:20,276
I'll get right on it.

49
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:26,783
I'll get your money, okay?
We shall return.

50
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:28,785
Halle- fuckin'- lujah.

51
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:32,789
Gimmie your cell.
I gotta call carmela.

52
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:38,795
You sure it was them?
They were drunk in gym class.

53
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:41,297
Byron barber vomited
all over the teacher.

54
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,299
I didn't even drink it.
I spat it out.

55
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,419
- Anthony.
- On top of this,
you're gonna lie to me now?

56
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,056
He's very sorry, father hagy,
and he's gonna be even sorrier
when he gets home.

57
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,558
Anthony, why don't you
wait outside.

58
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,069
He's suspended for three days.

59
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,571
Well, at least
let me pay for the wine.

60
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,074
The theft of the wine
is not just a crime
against property.

61
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:10,827
This is an affront to
our holy sacristy.

62
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:15,948
I've asked dr. Galani--
he's our school psychologist--
to join us.

63
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,703
He's been keeping
an eye on anthony,
meeting with his teachers.

64
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:22,705
Why don't you pick it up
from there, doctor.

65
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,960
Um, hi.

66
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,465
In many respects, anthony is
a normal, healthy eighth grader.

67
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,967
Sister patricia,
his art teacher,

68
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,971
thinks he shows strong skills
and spacial orientation.

69
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,975
But the thing is, though,
and it's not just
this one incident,

70
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:47,480
anthony sometimes has trouble
following the rules.

71
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,482
Weighing consequences.

72
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,986
At times, doesn't think
before he acts.

73
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:57,990
And it's thought that
there's a good possibility...

74
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,494
anthony could be a. D. D.

75
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,496
A. D. D.?
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,998
Attention deficit disorder.
I knew it.

77
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:09,001
I always knew
there was something.
Well, what is it?

78
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,003
It's an aggregate
of symptoms--

79
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,506
inattention, impulsivity.

80
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:17,009
Sometimes, although
not always, hyperactivity.

81
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,512
Of course, to be sure,
we'll need to give him
a thorough evaluation.

82
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,515
All he needs is
a whack upside the head.

83
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,017
If he's got an illness--
it's an illness, right?

84
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:29,772
You'd hit somebody
who was sick?
You'd hit somebody with polio?

85
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:35,411
- You hit anthony?
- Nobody gets hit in our house.

86
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:37,914
Not exactly my idea.

87
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:39,916
I don't know what the world's
comin' to if you can't
do a little tarantella...

88
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,919
on the kids every
once in a while when
they step out of line.

89
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,424
- So what happens now?
- He'll be given a complete
battery of testing.

90
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:50,927
Psychological, behavioral,
medical.

91
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,929
Let me ask you a question.

92
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:57,433
These other kids,
you keepin' an eye on them?
Are you testin' them?

93
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,685
The ones that aren't
named soprano?

94
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:01,938
There's no immediate plans
for that.

95
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:04,307
We attend every child
at verbum dei...

96
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:06,809
according to his own
special set of circumstances.

97
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:11,063
And so what dowe,
as the parents, do?

98
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,065
Nothin'?

99
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,068
Oh, no. I mean,
anthony's misbehaved.

100
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:19,071
He should be consequenced.

101
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,458
It's a crime.

102
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:26,462
To suspend that child
from school with all
the money you give them?

103
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:28,464
I bet that gym teacher
shit a brick...

104
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,334
when your little friend
puked on his boots,
huh, anthony?

105
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:35,972
- Wanna encourage him?
- Hey, whatever happened to
"boys will be boys"?

106
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:40,226
He stole from the church.
They don't make'em
any lower than that.

107
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,229
- What a loser.
- That's enough out of you.

108
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,232
His father was the same way.

109
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:50,736
I practically lived in
that vice president's office.

110
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:54,740
- Could we not, please?
- Well, you only remember
what you wanna remember.

111
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,743
Yeah, well, i must've had
another son...

112
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:01,247
who stole a car
when he was ten years old.

113
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah, he could barely see
over the steering wheel.

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,502
He was a hellion, this one.
Him and his little crew.

115
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:08,504
They used to steal lobsters
on the boats on the shore...

116
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:12,008
and sell'em for a buck a piece
down on bloomfield avenue.

117
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:15,511
- Really?
- How many times
do i gotta say this?

118
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,513
I don't want that kind of talk
in front of this kid!

119
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:21,017
- That stuff is wrong,
and i don't condone it!
- Yeah, sure.

120
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:23,019
- Who do you think
you're yellin' at?
- What?

121
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,638
- You stupe.
- What did you just say?

122
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,275
- I didn't say anything.
- What's he doin' now?
What's goin' on?

123
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,277
- He yells at me
like amiserable.
- Anthony.

124
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:35,398
I thought this could wait
till after dinner, but
your father and i have talked.

125
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:39,402
You are not to play mario cart
or go skateboarding
for three weeks.

126
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:41,404
And no tv.

127
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:44,407
- No.
- You're not gonna sit
on that internet either.

128
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:48,411
Every day, you ride your bike
to green grove retirement home
and visit grandma.

129
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:51,664
- Oh, that'll be nice.
- It's not fair!

130
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,177
Some fuckin' day, huh?
I feel like a bomb went off.

131
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,683
All the stuff
that doctor was sayin',

132
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,685
i never saw any of that
in anthony.

133
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,188
You never noticed the way
he picks at the tongue
of his tennis shoe?

134
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,191
Like he can't help himself.

135
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,193
If he even has this thing.

136
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,195
Something's goin' on.

137
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,706
Carm.
Yeah?

138
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,093
You think he knows?
I don't know.

139
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:39,095
She knows.

140
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:43,466
- Are you--
- really?
What makes you say that?

141
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:46,852
- Are you in--
- i don't know.

142
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:50,356
Things she says.
She makes remarks,
like this today with him.

143
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:56,612
- Are you in the mafia?
- She talk to you...about me?

144
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,731
Talk to me?

145
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:07,740
Did something happen
on that college trip?

146
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,494
- Happen? -

147
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:13,879
- like what?
-

148
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,384
i don't know.
She seemed peculiar
when she got back.

149
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:24,507
I think pretty soon we're
gonna have to, you know,

150
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:27,009
talk to her
about the business.

151
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,013
Yeah, the two of us
should sit down with meadow,

152
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:34,517
talk as a family.

153
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,153
And with him,
they'll give him the tests
and we'll see what's what.

154
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:41,157
Right?

155
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,661
Good night.

156
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:50,032
Good night.

157
00:11:02,044 --> 00:11:05,548
Maybe i don't wanna admit
there's something wrong
with my kid.

158
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:07,550
But this all sounds
like bullshit to me.

159
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,053
What do you mean?
If he's got a disease, why
do they tell me to punish him?

160
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:15,057
Doesn't that sound like bull?
A. D. D. Is
a controversial subject.

161
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:19,945
Is it a disease or a way
for these psychologists
to line their pockets?

162
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:27,820
Many children can really benefit
by professional intervention.

163
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,208
- He got in a little trouble.
- You don't consider
his behavior out of the norm?

164
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,710
No.

165
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:38,214
I don't know.

166
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:41,217
What do i know about it?
What do you mean?

167
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,836
Oh, i gotta
spell it out for you?

168
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,973
Do you see his behavior
as a reflection of your own?

169
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:54,980
Look, like i said,
maybe- maybe i don't wanna admit
there's something wrong,

170
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,485
but, you know,
if he's got this thing,
we'll deal with it.

171
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:04,106
If he had polio,
we'd deal with it.

172
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:07,109
You pick up the pieces
and you go on from there.

173
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:10,863
So that's what we're gonna do.

174
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,874
Do you have anything else
you wanna say about this?

175
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:32,268
Well, last time
you were telling me you had
intimate feelings for me.

176
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:35,271
But you've not mentioned it.

177
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:37,773
Intimate feelin's?

178
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:39,892
I think i said
i was in love.

179
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,395
How are you doing with it?

180
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,398
Well--

181
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:50,903
i just can't turn off
my feelings'cause you tell me
it's a byproduct of therapy.

182
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,539
I never said you should
turn off your feelings.

183
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,043
Well, i already got
a girlfriend.

184
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:02,665
She's russian. 24.

185
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,306
How old are you?

186
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:16,812
I find it interesting that
it took you so long to tell me
you had a girlfriend.

187
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,315
How are you doing with it?

188
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,938
I gotta ask you
one more question about my son.

189
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,943
You think i should...
go easy on him now,

190
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,445
or press him a little harder?

191
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:35,831
Well, that's difficult to say.

192
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:41,704
What, you want a raise, maybe,
to figure this out?

193
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,461
Anthony? Anthony jr. ,
you get up!

194
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,965
Why? I don't have to go
to school. I'm suspended.

195
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,967
You are not laying around
in bed all day.

196
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,970
We're not runnin'
a hotel over here.

197
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,472
Get up!
Have some breakfast.

198
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,475
I don't wanna.
I'm not hungry.

199
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,979
What you are gonna do today
is get up and go rake.

200
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,984
You're gonna do
some work around here.

201
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,486
Mom, where's my gray jacket?

202
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:17,990
I left it downstairs.
What'd you do with it?

203
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,992
Hello?

204
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:23,495
Anthony jr. ,
turn off that music!

205
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,998
Your father is sleeping!

206
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,001
You said i couldn't
watch tv or play nintendo.
What?

207
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,003
You didn't say anything
about music.

208
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,006
Turn it off right now!
Why?

209
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,760
Because i said so
and your father is sleeping,
for christ's sake!

210
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,764
Mom, i can't find it.
Where is it?

211
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,287
Johnny, come on!

212
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,791
Uncle jun, what are you
doin' here so early?

213
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:11,927
Where's your old man?
He said he'd be
waitin' outside.

214
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:15,931
- Want me to go get him?
- Hey. Did you hear
the game last night?

215
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:17,933
Joey pepitone, three rbis.

216
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,436
No kidding?
My mom made me go to bed.

217
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,438
Anthony, why aren't you
on your way to school?

218
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:24,440
You miss your bus,
you wanna walk through
the colored neighborhood?

219
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:28,310
Junior.
Big fancy car.

220
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,813
We're goin' to my sister's
tonight, and you promised
to bring a pork loin.

221
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:34,066
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
Nonstop. Don't you
get sick of yourself?

222
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:37,953
Dad, could you and uncle jun
give me a ride to school?

223
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:40,456
Not right now, tony.
You be good, though.

224
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:43,459
Pay attention to what
those teachers tell ya,
ya hear me, anthony?

225
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,328
Okay.

226
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,333
See ya, ma.
Okay. Be good.

227
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:09,852
Hey, wait up!
Shit.

228
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,989
- Hey, rocco.
- Come on!
Move, move, move, guys!

229
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:18,360
Move, move, move!
Hey, john, john,
one more day, man!

230
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:21,363
Don't make me come after you,
you fuckin' piece of shit!
There's gonna be a huge payoff!

231
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:24,867
I'll fuckin' kill you,
you piece of shit!

232
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,873
What do you got?
What do you got?

233
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,376
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck
are you bringing me here?

234
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:38,380
Huh? Who are you
fuckin' with, rocco?

235
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,768
Fuck you!
Motherfucker!

236
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,770
Huh?
You asshole!

237
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,392
Huh, rocco?
Piece of shit!

238
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,626
You're up.

239
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:11,380
Who the fuck can sleep
with all this shit goin' on?

240
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,383
I was thinkin' about
fuckin' jefferson airplane
this mornin'.

241
00:17:14,383 --> 00:17:18,387
How about that?
1967.

242
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:20,889
Made me think
about my father.
What about him?

243
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,644
First time i ever saw him
whack the shit out of somebody.

244
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,147
What made you think
about that?

245
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,517
Something to do
with my son, i think.

246
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,519
You know,
what's been goin' on.

247
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,024
Why did your father whack
the shit out of some guy?

248
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,528
I never saw him do
something like that.

249
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,530
I mean, he used to whack
us kids around a little bit.

250
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:47,166
Really?

251
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,170
Yeah, the belt was his, uh,
favorite child development tool.

252
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,790
Hmm.
This was different, though.

253
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,292
You could tell he knew
what he was doin'.

254
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:01,930
How did you feel about
your father after that?

255
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,433
I didn't want him
to do it to me.

256
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,553
Seriously.
What do you
want me to say?

257
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,555
I'm just glad
he wasn't a fag.

258
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,558
How did you and your father
get along?
Good.

259
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,061
He was a good guy, my father.
Everybody liked him.

260
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,063
He knew how
to have a good time.

261
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:22,568
He loved shellfish--
clams, oysters.

262
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,570
Taught us kids how to eat'em.
You put a little worcester
on there, you know.

263
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,572
You suck'em down.

264
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,074
It's good.

265
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,577
My mother never
ate anything raw.

266
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,834
But he wasn't around much.
What did he do
for a living?

267
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,587
Retail meat and provisions.

268
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,845
And a little numbers.
Extortion, loan sharkin'.
How did you feel about that?

269
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,598
How did i feel?
About your father...

270
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,601
being engaged in
illegal activities?

271
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:59,605
Well, i-- you know,
i never really knew about it.

272
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:03,358
- When did you find out?
- Who remembers?

273
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:06,361
But you thought of
that incident this morning.

274
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:09,998
Are you concerned that
your son is going to
find out about you?

275
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:12,367
Don't start talkin' to me
about legitimate business.

276
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,753
What about chemical companies?

277
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,755
Dumpin' all that shit
into the rivers,

278
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:21,260
and they got all these
deformed babies poppin' up
all over the place.

279
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,629
Does he know anything?

280
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,631
I don't know.

281
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,767
- Has he asked you?
- No.

282
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:32,020
- How are you
gonna handle that?
- I don't know.

283
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,525
- Did you ever talk
to your father about it?
- What, are you kiddin'?

284
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:46,401
No kiddin', tony.
That doesn't sound
like anthony.

285
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:49,404
Yesterday, he's a little boy.
Today, i gotta worry about him.

286
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:51,406
Teenagers.
Yeah.

287
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:54,409
My daughter's been givin' me
all this feminist shit
about this place.

288
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:57,913
How it "objectifies women."
You know, shit like that.

289
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,415
These girls are pullin' down
$1500 a week.

290
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:03,418
This bears no weight
with theprincipessa.

291
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:05,921
Meadow was one thing,
but this is myson.

292
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:08,924
Boys are different from girls.

293
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:11,426
Pussy, kevin and matt,

294
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:13,929
they ever ask you about
this thing of ours?

295
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:15,931
I lied through my teeth,
but they knew.

296
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:18,934
Fuckin' nitwits.
They love me anyway.

297
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:22,437
It's hard to raise kids
in an information age.

298
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:24,940
To protect them.

299
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:31,446
Hey.
Hey, what's up?

300
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:35,834
Who's got an anniversary
or special occasion?

301
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:39,588
What are these, antiques?
I was pickin' up
the chinaman's vig,

302
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:41,590
and the fed- fuckin'- ex van
was wide open.

303
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,592
Guy went in for a burger
or some shit.

304
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:47,963
No shit? Fedex.
They're usually pretty careful
with those.

305
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:51,350
- You did this
in broad daylight?
- Nobody saw me.

306
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:53,468
That's interstate commerce,
you fuckin'mamaluke.

307
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:56,605
You wanna spend eight years
in prison for a stupid stunt
like that, be my guest.

308
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:59,608
I'd take a lickin'
but keep on tickin'.

309
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,978
I'm gettin' the fuck outta here.
Jesus christ!

310
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:05,981
What's with his ass?

311
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:08,483
He's got a lot on his mind.

312
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:14,990
And what do you think
is going on
with this one, anthony?

313
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,492
I don't know.
How many more of these
are left?

314
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:20,495
The quicker you answer,
the faster we'll be done.

315
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:25,000
Whatever pops
into your mind.

316
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,252
'Cause there's no guy?

317
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:31,006
Okay, good.
Where do you think he is?

318
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:34,509
Out buying food
for the horse?

319
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:38,013
Anything else?

320
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,266
Watching tv, maybe.

321
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:44,269
Maybe he's watchingsouth park.
Number one was supposed
to be on tonight,

322
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,772
the one where cartman
gets abducted by aliens...

323
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,274
and they give him an anal probe
and it makes him fart fire.

324
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,783
You're home.

325
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:02,421
You know, if it's bad,
the a. D. D. , they put
anthony in special ed?

326
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,926
Doctors say that?
No, the doctors
don't know anything yet.

327
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,928
They just started the testing
this afternoon.

328
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,431
I just picked up these books
at the mall.

329
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,934
Help me to help my child?
Listen to this.

330
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,437
"Approximately 50% of children
diagnosed with a. D. D...

331
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,440
receive help from
special education teachers
in their school."

332
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,443
We don't even know
that's what he's got.
You're right.

333
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:29,064
Let's just be ignorant.
Why worry about anything now?

334
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:34,569
You blame me,
don't you?
Who said anything about that?

335
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:36,571
No, go ahead.
You blame me.

336
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:39,074
I blame myself.
For what?

337
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:41,076
"For what?"

338
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:44,579
For stayin' with me?

339
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:47,082
I have two eyes.

340
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:50,085
Oh.

341
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:52,087
And who do we blame
our daughter on?

342
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:54,589
Straight- a student,
national honors society,

343
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:57,092
featured soloist
in the choir.

344
00:22:57,092 --> 00:22:59,094
Yeah, this isn't
goin' anywhere.

345
00:22:59,094 --> 00:23:02,597
"Like father, like son,"
right? What about
"daddy's little girl"?

346
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,601
What about you?
You and your uncle lenny,
thatobatz.

347
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:09,104
My son's got that
in his gene pool.
Do i blame you for that?

348
00:23:09,237 --> 00:23:10,739
If it helps you.

349
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,123
Hi, grandma.

350
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:30,625
Well, look who's here.

351
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:33,628
Oh, look at that
little face.
Ow!

352
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:35,630
Ooh.

353
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,634
Pearl, meet me grandson.
This is your grandson?

354
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:43,138
He rode his bike
all the way over
to visit his grandma.

355
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:47,142
How do you like that?
How come he's not
in school?

356
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:50,645
Because he was a bad boy.
Ow!

357
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:52,647
Yes, he was.
That's why.

358
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:55,150
Oh, he's a big one!

359
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:01,656
She had a stroke.

360
00:24:01,656 --> 00:24:05,160
Now half her brain is gone.
Whoa.

361
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,664
So, what shall we do?
What shall we do?

362
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:12,167
Let's see. Ah.

363
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:17,172
Let's play scrabble.
You'd be surprised
how good your grandmother is.

364
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:20,175
I don't think so, grandma.
I'm kinda wiped.

365
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:22,677
Oh, you're
a 13- year- old boy.

366
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:25,680
You're too young
to be so tired.

367
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,682
They sent me to
a psychiatrist all morning.

368
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:32,187
I took, like,
a million tests.
A psychiatrist?

369
00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:35,190
Yeah, you know,
'cause i got suspended
and everything.

370
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,693
They sentyou
to a psychiatrist?

371
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:40,695
Yeah.

372
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:44,199
But that's crazy.
That's all nonsense.

373
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:47,702
That's nothin' but
a racket for the jews!

374
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:51,339
- Dad goes.
- He does not.

375
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,342
- Yes, he does.
- He does not.

376
00:24:54,342 --> 00:24:57,345
- Yes, he does.
- To a psychiatrist?

377
00:24:57,846 --> 00:25:00,849
- Yeah.
- He does not.

378
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:05,103
- He does too.
- But why do you say that?
That's ridiculous.

379
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,606
Because it's true.
I heard him and mom
talkin' about it.

380
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,358
What does he need
a psychiatrist for?

381
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,362
Is it okay if i take
that pear, grandma?

382
00:25:16,364 --> 00:25:20,368
He goes to talk
about his mother.
That's what he's doing.

383
00:25:20,735 --> 00:25:24,239
He talks about me,
he complains.

384
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:27,742
"She didn't do this.
She did that."

385
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:29,377
Yeah.

386
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:34,382
I gave my life to my children
on a silver platter.

387
00:25:34,382 --> 00:25:38,003
And this is how
he repays me?

388
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:49,898
Dad, what's that noise?
Noise?

389
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:54,269
It's a flat tire.
I asked you to clean those nails
out of the driveway, didn't i?

390
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,024
I was prayin'
for somethin' like this.

391
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:02,027
I spent too much money
on braces for two years...

392
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,529
not to take you
to the dentist now.

393
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,533
Maybe we should call
the auto club.

394
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:13,038
We change tires at our house.
Watch and learn.

395
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:21,546
Yesterday,
with the psychologist,
how'd that go?

396
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,182
Okay.

397
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,185
Yeah?
What'd you guys do?

398
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:29,437
He made me look at these,
like, pictures and stuff,

399
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:31,439
and then i had to say
something about them.

400
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,942
What'd you talk about?
Anything interesting?

401
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:37,445
That's kind of between
me and my therapist.

402
00:26:37,445 --> 00:26:39,948
He told me i didn't have
to say anything
if i didn't want to.

403
00:26:39,948 --> 00:26:42,450
That's what we pay extra for
at that school?

404
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,710
Anthony,
the other night at dinner,
you made a remark.

405
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,713
No, i didn't.
Yeah, you did.

406
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,715
Don't worry about it.
I'm not mad.

407
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:00,468
I just need to know
what you meant by it.
I didn't mean anything.

408
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:01,970
Come on.

409
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:08,476
Some kids at school
said some stuff.

410
00:27:08,476 --> 00:27:12,480
What'd they say?
That you were in the mafia.

411
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:15,483
And what do you think?

412
00:27:15,984 --> 00:27:19,988
I don't know.
There were all those guys
at uncle jackie's funeral,

413
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:23,491
and those other guys writing
down license plate numbers
and taking pictures.

414
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:25,994
Those were feds, right?
Just like ingodfather i.

415
00:27:26,494 --> 00:27:30,999
Uncle jackie's funeral.
Right.
Then i was on the web.

416
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,251
I found this page
with uncle jackie on it.

417
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:37,255
It said he ran some union
that ripped off these
pension things or something.

418
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:42,127
Uncle jackie
was a complicated man.

419
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,129
But you loved him,
right?

420
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,631
Yeah.

421
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:49,134
You didn't see me
on that web thing, did ya?

422
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,635
No.

423
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:53,138
That's right.

424
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:57,142
Give me a hand with this thing,
so we can get the algae
scraped off your teeth.

425
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:02,897
I'm goin' crazy with this shit--
what he knows,
what he doesn't know.

426
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,901
He's gonna find out eventually.
What difference does it make?

427
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:11,406
Me, my father.

428
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:13,408
It's probably in
the genes, right?

429
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:18,413
You know, this a. D. D. Thing.
It's probably all genetical.

430
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:24,552
But what about pussy?

431
00:28:24,552 --> 00:28:27,055
He's an acquaintance of mine.

432
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:30,058
This guy is a stone gangster,
and he's got three kids--

433
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:32,060
one who graduated and two
who are going to villaenova.

434
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,563
- How do you account for that?
- Then you got leopold and loeb.

435
00:28:35,563 --> 00:28:37,565
They cornhole and murder
this kid for fun,

436
00:28:37,565 --> 00:28:41,186
and their father
was a successful businessman,
a fuckin' millionaire.

437
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,439
Do you hold
your father responsible
for what you've become?

438
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:46,941
Yeah, sometimes
i think about...

439
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:49,444
what life would've been like
if my father
hadn't gotten mixed up...

440
00:28:49,944 --> 00:28:52,080
in the things
he got mixed up in.

441
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,582
How life
would've been different.

442
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:58,953
Maybe i'd be sellin'
patio furniture in san diego
or whatever.

443
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:02,457
We were talking last time
about how you felt
when you became aware...

444
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:04,459
of your father's
criminal life.

445
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:07,712
Do you have any more
thoughts on that?

446
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,966
When you first started
therapy, you said...

447
00:29:11,966 --> 00:29:14,969
that you had this dream
about those ducks.

448
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,107
They flew away with your penis.
It was a bad omen.

449
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:23,111
That something was going
to happen in your family.

450
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:25,480
Is this the terrible thing?

451
00:29:27,982 --> 00:29:31,736
Look, if you know somethin',
please, quit fuckin' around.

452
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,239
I think it's important
to remember.

453
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,242
You said you liked
the history channel.

454
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:41,246
He who doesn't understand
history is doomed to repeat it.

455
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,632
Let's talk
about your father.

456
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:46,634
My father.

457
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:54,259
- Heads up!

458
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:07,522
- Why are you smiling?
- Just thinkin' about my uncle.

459
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:09,524
He used to throw
the ball with me.

460
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:12,026
The one with whom
you have all the static?

461
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,661
Yeah.

462
00:30:14,162 --> 00:30:16,164
Uncle jun.

463
00:30:16,164 --> 00:30:20,785
He was always practicin'
his curve ball outside,
in front of the house.

464
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:25,290
I was probably about...
eight or nine.

465
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,294
Then my sister came out.

466
00:30:29,677 --> 00:30:32,547
The one who lives
in california?
Yeah.

467
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:35,183
Janice.

468
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:38,186
How does she feel
about your parents?

469
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:41,189
Who gives a fuck what she
thinks? She calls herself
vishnamatha or somethin'.

470
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:44,442
Soprano isn't
good enough for her.
Fuckin' wannabe dothead.

471
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,945
Why were you thinking
of your uncle?

472
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,697
I don't know.

473
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:53,201
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting in the car.

474
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:57,205
- Why? Where are you going?
- Someplace.

475
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:01,209
Dad, where are you going?
Can i come too?

476
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:04,712
No, your mother wants you
to help her get the screens
down to the basement.

477
00:31:04,712 --> 00:31:07,215
No, i wanna go
with you guys.

478
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:10,218
He said no.
Janice.

479
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:13,221
Neither one of you's
will be goin' if you talk
to your brother like that.

480
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:24,599
Go on.

481
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,103
My mother was inside,
cookin' the meat for the gravy.

482
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:32,607
You know, the red lead,
pork bones and veal.

483
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:34,359
It was a sunday.
But you said--

484
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,861
i said we'd see.

485
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:38,863
What's the matter
with that child?
She won't eat.

486
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,866
Please, you won't have to
give me anything for christmas
if you get me this.

487
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,868
And you won't have to tell me
to take the garbage out.

488
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,120
I'm not supposed
to have to tell you
to take the garbage out!

489
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,506
Then why can't i have this?
It isn't fair!

490
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,125
I don't wanna hear about
that stupid electric organ
anymore!

491
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,878
- It's not stupid.
It's fun.
- I said enough!

492
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,880
He won't give me
a moment's peace.

493
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,384
If janice wanted it,
she'd get it. Janice always
gets everything she wants.

494
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,637
Where were they going today?
I don't know why i couldn't go.

495
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,890
- That's because your sister
does as she's told.
- That's right. I forgot.

496
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,393
Janice never does
anything wrong.
She's just perfect, perfect.

497
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:11,779
You're driving me crazy!

498
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,899
- No, i'm not.
- She said what?

499
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,535
She was high- strung, my mother.
Very dramatic.

500
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,537
Every night to her
is a night at the opera.

501
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,658
I could stick this fork
in your eye!

502
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:27,161
She wasn't gonna do it.
Holy shit.

503
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,547
That's why
i'm rememberin' all this.

504
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,549
On account of
where they were goin'.

505
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,803
- Where were they going?
- I found out
a couple sundays later.

506
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:39,057
The toll now stands at
11 dead and 600 wounded,

507
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,559
as well as hundreds
of businesses set ablaze--

508
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,062
mom, i'm going to
the c. Y. O. To play ball.

509
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,565
Take a bat with you.
Look what they're doin'
on springfield avenue.

510
00:32:47,815 --> 00:32:50,818
Looting and sniper fire along
springfield avenue continue...

511
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:55,323
with mayor lou avenitzio
now placing the blame
on outside agitators.

512
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:23,351
Come on, dad!
Let's go!

513
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:25,853
I'm comin'.
I'm comin'.

514
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:28,856
Janice, keep your sticky
fingers off the car.

515
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:30,858
I just waxed
the damn thing.

516
00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:38,866
Can i steer?

517
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:41,369
Maybe on the way home,
honey.

518
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:56,551
Here we are.

519
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:08,563
Come on.

520
00:34:43,097 --> 00:34:44,599
Uncle jun?

521
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:48,352
Here.
Buy something nice.

522
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,731
My heart was broken.

523
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:04,235
You felt your father
was showing favoritism.

524
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,737
I still remember that feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

525
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,739
Did you confront them?

526
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,741
Have you been listenin'
to what i've been sayin'?

527
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:14,245
Kids don't confront
in my family.

528
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,881
But how does this pertain to
the situation with your son?

529
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:21,886
'Cause this amusement park
was where i found out my father
wasn't like other fathers.

530
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,389
I took the bus this time.

531
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,892
It was three transfers
from newark.

532
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,395
I had this candy bar
in my pocket.

533
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:35,149
It had sand or lint
or somethin' on it.

534
00:35:43,157 --> 00:35:45,660
Hey, what you doin'?
Where you spittin'?

535
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,162
What do you mean?
I ain't doin' nothin'.
Yes, you did.

536
00:35:48,162 --> 00:35:50,164
You threw that wrapper
on the floor.
Pick it up!

537
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:53,167
Leave me alone!
Come back here!
You're gonna pick it up!

538
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:03,177
What in the world?
- I don't know!

539
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,800
There he is!
Stop or i'll shoot!

540
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,435
You're under arrest!

541
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,438
- Stop!
-

542
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:18,059
- you're under arrest!

543
00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:22,697
Give me your hands!
Guy's name was chicky sasso,

544
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:24,699
my father's cousin
on his mother's side.

545
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:28,452
Got out of vietnam
on account of that cop
blew his knee cap off.

546
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:35,576
What the fuck's the matter
with you cops?

547
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:37,578
Can't bring your kid to
an amusement park no more?

548
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:39,580
Daddy!

549
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:41,716
Daddy!
It's okay, baby.
It's okay, honey.

550
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:43,718
You go home
to mommy, sweetheart.
We'll take you home.

551
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,472
Why don't you go lock up
themoullions?

552
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,474
They're the ones that are
burnin' down newark.

553
00:37:01,102 --> 00:37:04,105
I wanna call my lawyer.
I'm not sayin' shit
to you guys.

554
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:06,240
That's johnny boy soprano!

555
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,112
Whoa!

556
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:14,115
Asshole!
You're hurtin' my wrist!

557
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,253
Get the fuck in there,
clarabell.

558
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:23,257
He was usin' my sister janice
as a front.

559
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:25,259
All the guys
brought their daughters,

560
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,762
so that when they did
their business it would
look sweet and innocent.

561
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,014
That must have been
devastating.

562
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:32,633
Nah, it turned out
it was no big deal.

563
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,386
To see your father handcuffed,
being led away by the police?

564
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:40,274
Well, at the time, i thought
my head was gonna explode.

565
00:37:40,274 --> 00:37:42,276
He looked...helpless.

566
00:37:44,278 --> 00:37:49,784
But when i got home, my mother
had a different perspective,
which made me feel better.

567
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:54,155
- So in her pain,
she reached out to you.
- That's one way to put it.

568
00:37:54,155 --> 00:37:57,792
Your father may not be
home for dinner tonight.
Go wash up.

569
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:00,294
I know.
What do you know?

570
00:38:00,795 --> 00:38:03,798
I saw him gettin' arrested.
What did he do?

571
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:06,667
He didn't do anything.
They just pick on the italians.

572
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:08,669
Still, in my heart,

573
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:11,422
i knew my father
was no freedom fighter.

574
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,809
- So he went to jail?
- No, he came home
in a couple of hours.

575
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:17,311
We were watchin'
ed sullivan.

576
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:30,191
Hey. Livia!

577
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:32,193
Daddy!
Look who's home!

578
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:35,196
What happened?
What happened?

579
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:37,698
I stopped at nasto's,
got you some cherry vanilla.

580
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:40,201
That didn't take long.
Must be in good
with the uppity- ups.

581
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:42,703
Yeah.

582
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:44,705
Let this be
a lesson to ya's.

583
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:49,710
Those stupid cops,
they went to the wrong place,
arrested the wrong guys.

584
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,213
How's my little girl?
You all right, sweetheart?

585
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:54,215
I'm okay.
Good.

586
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:57,718
Johnny boy!
Hey, johnny boy! Hey!

587
00:38:57,718 --> 00:39:01,722
Good for you, johnny!
Show those fuckin'
sons of bitches.

588
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:04,225
What's up, rocco?

589
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:12,233
So...everything okay here?
I don't understand.

590
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,619
The man your father beat up
was the same one
who was congratulating him?

591
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,491
Yeah, one of'em.
Rocco alatore.

592
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,494
Why did they arrest
your father?

593
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,996
He was in violation
of his parole.

594
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,999
"Association with
known undesirables."

595
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,502
But nothin' ever
happened about it.
It just kinda went away.

596
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,504
He'd been in prison?

597
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:39,009
He was away when i was little,
but they told me he was
in montana bein' a cowboy.

598
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,016
What?

599
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,157
- My son is doomed, right?
- Why do you say that?

600
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,526
Come on.
This is the part...

601
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:58,529
where i'm supposed to tell ya
how terrible my father was...

602
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:02,032
and the terrible things
he did to me
and how he ruined my life.

603
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:06,537
But i'll tell you somethin'.
I was proud to be
johnny soprano's kid.

604
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,039
When he beat the shit
out of that guy,
i went to the class,

605
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,542
i told'em how tough
my father was.

606
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:13,677
Do you think that's how
your son feels about you?

607
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,046
Yeah, probably.
And i'm glad.

608
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,048
I'm glad if he's proud of me.

609
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:21,685
But that's the bind i'm in,
'cause i don't want him
to be like me.

610
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,687
He can be anything
he wants to be.

611
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:25,940
He could be like, um,
this guy i knew in high school.

612
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,943
His grandfather invented
these little ties that go
on the end of salamis.

613
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:32,813
He made millions of dollars.
He's sittin' on his ass.

614
00:40:32,813 --> 00:40:35,316
Have you communicated
any of this to your son?

615
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:37,451
Not in so many words.

616
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:42,957
Probably not at all.

617
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,460
What difference would it make?
You said so yourself.

618
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,463
It's in the blood.
It's hereditary.

619
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:53,334
Genetic predispositions
are only that--
predispositions.

620
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:57,338
It's not a destiny
written in stone.
People have choices.

621
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,590
She finally offers an opinion.

622
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:04,094
Well, they do.
You think that everything
that happens is preordained?

623
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:08,098
You don't think that
human beings possess free will?

624
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,484
How come i'm not makin'
fuckin' pots in peru?

625
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:15,489
You're born to this shit.
You are what you are.

626
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:20,494
Within that,
there's a range of choices.
This is america.

627
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,614
Right. America.

628
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,617
So, livia, what do you think?

629
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,119
Huh?
Okies and misfits.

630
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,121
That's who goes there--
losers.

631
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:34,625
The beverly hillbillies.
So now rocco alatore's
a loser?

632
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:39,129
I know i've had to rough
rocco up because of money, but
the guy's got a fuckin' brain.

633
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:41,015
He's gonna open
a new book out there.

634
00:41:41,515 --> 00:41:43,517
And after that gets up,
we get a little
cash flow goin'--

635
00:41:43,517 --> 00:41:46,520
oh, mr. Cash flow.
Big business man now.

636
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,890
Well, what do you know
about it? You're scared
of your own shadow.

637
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:52,893
Reno is growin'
by leaps and bounds, livia.

638
00:41:52,893 --> 00:41:55,396
It's a chance to get in
on the ground floor!

639
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:58,399
After rocco gets a book up,
he's gonna open
a new supper club.

640
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:00,150
He wantsmeto run it.

641
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,653
A supper club.
Are you drunk?

642
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,155
Jesus christ almighty!

643
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:07,157
Fuckin' albacore
around my neck!

644
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:10,160
Every time i try to do
somethin'-- me and the kids
will go without ya!

645
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:13,047
They are not goin'
anywhere!

646
00:42:13,047 --> 00:42:16,050
I'd rather smother them
with a pillow...

647
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:20,054
then take them to nevada!
Always with the drama!

648
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:28,729
Livia.
Here you are.
Oh, junior.

649
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:30,731
You scared me to death.

650
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:33,734
I can't stay,
but i didn't wanna let
another day go by.

651
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:36,237
Business headaches
like you wouldn't believe.

652
00:42:36,237 --> 00:42:40,608
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You and theotherone,
with all your headaches.

653
00:42:41,108 --> 00:42:44,111
Who, tony?
You shouldn't be
so hard on him.

654
00:42:44,612 --> 00:42:47,114
He's got a lot to learn,
granted, but he's headed
in the right direction.

655
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:51,252
Where to? Overbrook
state mental hospital?

656
00:42:51,252 --> 00:42:53,120
What?

657
00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:55,623
Hey, uncle jun.
How ya doin'?

658
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:57,625
Hey.

659
00:43:00,628 --> 00:43:02,630
He's keepin' his hair.

660
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:06,133
You see, what a good boy,
he comes to visit his mother.

661
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,888
Um, my son's stayin'
for dinner, junior.

662
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,390
I don't suppose
you have time.

663
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,526
You two wanna
visit each other.

664
00:43:15,776 --> 00:43:19,897
Junior's very busy these days
with his headaches.

665
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:22,399
Not too busy to shoot the shit
with you, tony.

666
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,401
We gotta try
and catch a ball game.

667
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,404
Yeah, you got my number.
All right.

668
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,407
That man...

669
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:33,911
is so full of himself
since becomingcopporuggi.

670
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,913
He makes me sick.

671
00:43:41,669 --> 00:43:43,671
You remember
the alatores, ma?

672
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:47,174
Oh, why wouldn't i?
You know, they moved to nevada.

673
00:43:47,174 --> 00:43:52,179
They're billionaires now.
Oh, that rocco alatore,
he was a real go- getter.

674
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,182
Didn't dad
wanna go with him?
Your father?

675
00:43:55,182 --> 00:43:58,686
No.
Yeah, he did.

676
00:43:58,686 --> 00:44:00,688
I remember you guys
talkin' about it.

677
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:03,691
Alatore was gonna start
a business. Dad was gonna
do a little thing with him.

678
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:06,694
Oh, well, rocco just got him
all worked up, that's all.

679
00:44:06,694 --> 00:44:09,330
What is this
with all these questions?

680
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,833
Dad wanted to go with him.
You wouldn't let him.

681
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,952
Let him?
Mmm.

682
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:18,455
What do you mean?
You just tell me...

683
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:22,960
one time your father didn't do
exactly as he wanted.

684
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:26,463
I don't know.

685
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:28,966
Maybe this was his chance
to get out.

686
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,468
Dad was no choir boy,
but maybe with
a little bit of support.

687
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:35,606
Oh, mr. Sensitive, now.

688
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:39,610
Well, if it bothers you,
maybe you better talk
to a psychiatrist.

689
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,617
Whoa.
What are you talkin' about,
a psychiatrist?

690
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:49,486
Well, that's what people do
when they're lookin'...

691
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:52,122
for somebody to blame
for their life, isn't it?

692
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:54,124
You're a real stone player,
aren't you, ma?

693
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:59,129
You threatened
to smother his children.
What does that mean?

694
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,383
Everybody thought dad
was the ruthless one,
but i gotta hand it to you.

695
00:45:02,383 --> 00:45:04,885
If you'd been born
after those feminists,

696
00:45:05,386 --> 00:45:08,389
you woulda been
the real gangster.

697
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:12,009
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

698
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:20,651
Hi. Hi, please, sit.

699
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:25,656
I know you're probably eager
to hear the results
of our testing.

700
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:29,159
How's anthony doing?
Uh, good, i think.
Don't you think so, tony?

701
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,662
Yeah, i think so.
Okay.

702
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:35,666
Well, good.
Uh, let's get to it.

703
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:40,671
The good news is,
no evidence of
learning disability.

704
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:44,174
Cognitive function,
verbal and nonverbal,

705
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:47,795
intelligence testing,
arithmetic and
reading evaluation...

706
00:45:48,295 --> 00:45:50,297
all within
the normal range.
Oh, thank goodness.

707
00:45:50,297 --> 00:45:52,800
Got a clean bill of health
from his pediatrician.

708
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,803
No soft sign on
the neurological either.

709
00:45:55,803 --> 00:45:59,807
That's all the good news.
Now, why don't you tell us
the bad news.

710
00:45:59,807 --> 00:46:01,809
Well...

711
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:04,812
as to whether anthony
has a. D. D.

712
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:07,314
The results
were interesting.

713
00:46:07,314 --> 00:46:09,316
The a. P. A. Standard
is for the subject...

714
00:46:09,817 --> 00:46:13,821
to manifest six out of
nine possible symptoms
of a. D. D.

715
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:17,708
In testing, anthony manifested
five of those symptoms.

716
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,710
Five? Really?

717
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,330
He often has difficulty
awaiting his turn;

718
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:27,835
is often "on the go,"
or acts as if driven by a motor;

719
00:46:27,835 --> 00:46:30,838
often interrupts
or intrudes on others;

720
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:33,974
and often fidgets
with hands or feet.

721
00:46:33,974 --> 00:46:35,976
He "fidgets with
hands or feet"?

722
00:46:36,343 --> 00:46:38,595
That's right.

723
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,599
You mean, like,
he fidgets?

724
00:46:42,983 --> 00:46:44,485
Uh- huh.

725
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:46,987
And that's a sickness,
the fidget?

726
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:51,492
Mr. Soprano, it's one
of nine possible symptoms.

727
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,996
What constitutes a fidget?

728
00:46:57,498 --> 00:47:00,868
- Tony--
- no, no.
What constitutes a fidget?

729
00:47:01,368 --> 00:47:05,122
So what if he fidgets?
He's in school.
Who doesn't fidget in school?

730
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,624
And he doesn't wait his turn?
The kid's in puberty.

731
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,626
He gets a hard- on
every ten minutes,
for christ's sake.

732
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,513
- Anthony is a borderline case.
- Hold it. He's not a case.

733
00:47:12,513 --> 00:47:15,015
He's a 13- year- old boy.
That's the trouble
with you people.

734
00:47:15,015 --> 00:47:17,518
Every time you see a problem,
you turn it into a disease.

735
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:20,137
He's a kid who made a mistake,
and he's gonna pay for it.

736
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:23,273
But he's gonna be fine.
Come on.

737
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:30,030
Frankly, i think he's right.

738
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,649
And i don't think
we should have to pay
for this testing either.

739
00:47:37,404 --> 00:47:41,408
To oppose this massive force
bearing down on midway,

740
00:47:41,408 --> 00:47:45,412
admiral nimetts
had no battleships
in shape for the fight.

741
00:47:45,913 --> 00:47:47,915
However, he had the carriers...

742
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:52,302
yorktown, enterprise
andhornet.

743
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:56,673
This might prove
to be the trump card.

744
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,585
You studying?

745
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:27,087
Government.

746
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:31,592
It's not the end
of the world, anth.

747
00:48:32,092 --> 00:48:34,094
I'm depressed.

748
00:48:34,094 --> 00:48:36,597
You're not depressed.

749
00:48:36,597 --> 00:48:40,100
You're sad and you're angry
'cause you did somethin' stupid,
and you got grounded.

750
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:43,604
And you can't watch tv or play
on your fuckin' computer
for two and a half weeks.

751
00:48:43,604 --> 00:48:47,107
It's gonna stay like that.

752
00:48:47,107 --> 00:48:49,109
It isn't fair.

753
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:51,111
Got that right.

754
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:06,493
What are you doin'?
What's it look like?

755
00:49:08,996 --> 00:49:10,998
Can i have one too?

756
00:49:11,498 --> 00:49:13,500
This one's yours.

757
00:49:14,501 --> 00:49:16,503
Gonna need sprinkles.

758
00:49:19,006 --> 00:49:21,008
Okay.

759
00:49:21,008 --> 00:49:24,011
You want nuts?
Yeah.

760
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:26,013
M&ms?

761
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:51,672
Pretty good.
