1
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:34,567
motherfucker!

2
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,934
<i>i just got rid of the last.</i>

3
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,468
thank fuckin' christ.

4
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,201
<i>i drove up
to connecticut.</i>

5
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:54,500
<i>good. the rump roast
went in down the shore.</i>

6
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:57,234
so the barbecue over in
sheepshead bay-- that still a go?

7
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:00,267
you know i'm not really sure
where the big guy left that.

8
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,434
this way, sweetheart. there's something
i need to get straight between us.

9
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:28,434
seriously, you look
beautiful tonight.

10
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,267
yeah.

11
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:57,034
<i>it's done. listen.</i>

12
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:01,600
gee, sounds like
a real weenie roast.

13
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:04,334
hey, your friend the shah was
walkin' in when it happened.

14
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:07,334
<i>him and some skifusa got
blown back on their keisters.</i>

15
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,334
...and last, transfer of
the deed to jamba juice.

16
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:19,267
- thank you.
- thanks.

17
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:25,001
i'll meet you
out front.

18
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:27,600
listen, i just wanted to apologize

19
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:32,700
that night...

20
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:35,201
it's just i make it a
policy not to mix business--

21
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:37,301
no apology necessary,
seriously.

22
00:04:37,368 --> 00:04:40,301
good, 'cause the truth is i haven't
been able to forget about you

23
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:43,834
and it ain't like
i haven't been tryin'.

24
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,267
so, you free for dinner? maybe?

25
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:50,401
thanks, but i
think i'll pass.

26
00:04:50,468 --> 00:04:52,500
congratulations
on the sale, though.

27
00:04:57,633 --> 00:05:00,834
"morning sunshine,"
benjamin moore.

28
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,034
and we can do the borders
with the disney characters.

29
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,934
makes me nervous,
this stuff.

30
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:10,567
we should wait to decorate
till after the baby's born.

31
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:13,633
again with
the superstitions?

32
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,834
remember the penguin
movie, how you cried?

33
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,500
you sit on an egg
for months,

34
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:21,267
one little thing goes wrong,
you're left with nothing.

35
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:25,934
honey, i'm
not adrianna.

36
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:29,201
i'm healthy.
our baby's healthy.

37
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:31,934
stop worrying and enjoy this time, okay?

38
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:35,101
i am. let's just stop
countin' the chickens.

39
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:38,734
<i>any anesthesiologist, dial 5248.</i>

40
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:56,667
workin' man
get off okay?

41
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:58,533
he was gone by the time i got up.

42
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,734
used to be he wasn't home
by the time you got up.

43
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:08,134
what's the matter?

44
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:13,067
liz la cerva tried to
commit suicide. pills.

45
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:15,234
what'd she do
that for?

46
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:18,368
apparently she got a letter
for ade from the salvation army.

47
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:21,034
- ade's homeless?
- she made a donation every year

48
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:22,967
to feed the homeless
on thanksgiving.

49
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:25,667
the letter set
liz off, evidently.

50
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:28,800
look i gotta say i commiserate
with the woman, but--

51
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:30,633
she thinks her
daughter is dead.

52
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,800
i told you i had another
dream about ade in paris.

53
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:38,101
a french policeman told me she
was dead and i had to tell her.

54
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,001
i know, carm.
pepe le pew--

55
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,334
doesn't change the fact
that adrianna is missing.

56
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,967
it also doesn't change the fact
that her mother's a bitter lush

57
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:46,967
- who can't accept reality.
- what reality?

58
00:06:47,034 --> 00:06:50,468
that her daughter couldn't
stand her so she moved away.

59
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:52,334
that's what you
say to me two weeks

60
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:54,633
after our own daughter
moves away to california.

61
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,468
oh come on, will you stop? it's
a different situation entirely.

62
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:01,533
i'm sorry, i'm sorry.
it's just...

63
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,134
it's just everything
all at once.

64
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,934
what everything?

65
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:08,633
the holidays are coming and
my spec house has gone to shit.

66
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,867
well, a.j.'s got a job.
he's doing better.

67
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,401
you raised
two gorgeous kids.

68
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,001
you got a husband
that loves you.

69
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,834
you made us
a beautiful home.

70
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:22,201
doesn't that count
for something?

71
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:27,767
come on.

72
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:33,067
<i>not exactly a
thanksgiving day classic here, ed...</i>

73
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,834
the fuck?
come on, cut it out.

74
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,500
he's already talkin' like
a real construction worker.

75
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:42,567
yeah, funny. see how you
like working out in the cold.

76
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:46,867
go check on the bird.

77
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:49,301
bring back
some onion dip too.

78
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,434
so how's your bird
these days?

79
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,201
what the fuck
are you talkin' about?

80
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:06,001
come on, clandestine
phone calls--

81
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,700
i know you got
a new goomar.

82
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:10,500
- what can i say, huh?
- with a pregnant wife at home.

83
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,301
your timing is
fuckin' priceless.

84
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:15,134
playground's closed.
a man has his needs.

85
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:17,301
good point. when carmela
had her spec house,

86
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:19,800
i can't tell you how many
nights i had to fend for myself

87
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,667
'cause she was out lookin'
at bathroom fixtures.

88
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,334
so this new one-- how come
you don't bring her around?

89
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:27,533
honestly
i would but...

90
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,034
between us,
she's black.

91
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:32,201
- oh!
- you're bangin' a shine?

92
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:35,167
she's hot too.
classy.

93
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:36,800
not that it
would matter to paulie.

94
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:38,967
i'd still have to listen
to all his racial bullshit.

95
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:42,401
yeah. she would feel it too.

96
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,234
hey, uncle paulie.

97
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:03,401
the fuck you doin'?

98
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:12,334
there's my girl. come
here. gimme that cheek.

99
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:16,134
i got your check.

100
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:18,600
she a doll or what?
blanca.

101
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,401
hi. i'm anthony.

102
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:25,234
yeah. i just did
your paperwork.

103
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:28,934
- you live in jersey?
- hello.

104
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,800
my urologist.
i gotta take this.

105
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,434
soprano!

106
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:12,468
i would've cleaned up
if you gave me a minute.

107
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,167
you started it.

108
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:24,234
seriously, i'm sorry
it's such a pigsty.

109
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,201
i just work a lot
and i'm a pig.

110
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:32,134
gonna get
a tree in here?

111
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:35,001
i come from hanukkah people,
but it doesn't do a lot for me.

112
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,600
so christmas eve's
just another day to you?

113
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:42,267
actually, we usually go to
some incredibly shitty movie.

114
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:43,767
<i>there's nothin' else
to choose from.</i>

115
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:45,600
makes me worried
about my project.

116
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:49,533
- you ruined my dress.
- save it.

117
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,800
like monica lewinsky.

118
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:54,434
show your friends how
hard you made me come.

119
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,567
mmm.

120
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:03,767
what are we doing
here, huh?

121
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:07,067
i don't know.

122
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,368
can't stop thinkin' about
fucking you all the time.

123
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:20,567
how can you even like a person
who sleeps with a married guy?

124
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,434
can we not talk
about it?

125
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,368
i rushed in with her.
i thought i wanted it.

126
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:30,334
you do. and you're
not giving it a chance.

127
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:34,600
you'll see eventually you'll
want kids. it'll be good.

128
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:37,468
i don't want a family
with her.

129
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:39,234
she's got no idea
who i am.

130
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,234
she doesn't
understand you?

131
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:58,434
as we know, phil asked me
to arrange this meeting

132
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,934
after the fire
in his wire room.

133
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:02,667
correction. you asked
me to fuckin' attend.

134
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:05,500
- i agreed.
- fair enough.

135
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,267
now i won't call it
a sit-down because

136
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:09,967
of the inclement
negative implications.

137
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:13,533
let's think of it as...
a meeting of minds.

138
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,234
<i>now for whatever reason,
certain incidents</i>

139
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:20,667
have expired lately that in
addition to being dangerous

140
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:23,600
could have an adverse impact
on our respective bottom lines.

141
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:27,767
i know vito's bottom was impacted
if that's what you're referring to.

142
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:29,667
call him what you will, but you're
talkin' about one of my captains.

143
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:32,800
captain? the good ship lollipop, right?

144
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:34,934
- phil, please.
- please, my ass.

145
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:36,834
the man was
a fuckin' disgrace.

146
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,533
well, before he came
out of the closet

147
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,401
he worked for me.
and he put

148
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,101
a lot of money in my
pocket. and yours too.

149
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,867
talk about earners?
how about fat dom gamiello?

150
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,234
- what about him?
- he's mia.

151
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,600
a lot of people are
concerned for his well-being.

152
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,533
so what the fuck would
i know about that?

153
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,600
well as coincidence would have
it, he was last seen in new jersey.

154
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,267
so was the hindenburg. maybe
you wanna look into that too.

155
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:01,134
tony, please.
phil.

156
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:03,468
we're getting
off point.

157
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,101
i grew up
in this, guys.

158
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,301
and i just lost
my friend, rusty,

159
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:12,134
<i>and for reasons i will
discern in time, believe me.</i>

160
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:15,667
if there's one thing my
father taught me it's this:

161
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:19,267
a pint of blood costs
more than a gallon of gold.

162
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,800
my business,
all of our businesses--

163
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:26,101
this infighting's
costing money.

164
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:28,101
i'm willing
to move forward,

165
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:31,600
let the past
be bygones.

166
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,001
- fine with me.
- a wise decision

167
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:35,600
on both your parts.

168
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,201
now what i'd love
to see is a truce.

169
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:39,301
wipe
the slate clean.

170
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:44,134
the no-shows, the wire room,
vito-- put it all behind us.

171
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:45,700
yeah.

172
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,900
your brother billy,
whatever happened there--

173
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:50,867
- all right then.
- "whatever happened there?"

174
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:53,001
- the shooting.
- "whatever happened there?"

175
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:56,067
- god rest his soul, huh?
- i'll tell you what fuckin' happened.

176
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:58,667
- this piece of shit's cousin put six bullets...
- calm down, phil.

177
00:13:58,734 --> 00:14:01,401
...in the kid without
any provocation whatsoever!

178
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:03,301
- my cousin's dead.
- fuck you!

179
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:05,633
phil, we were making headway
here. i didn't mean to say--

180
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,368
fuck what you mean,
cocksucker!

181
00:14:08,434 --> 00:14:10,067
come on.

182
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,067
jesus christ, carmine.
what the fuck?

183
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:19,600
why would you possibly
bring that up?

184
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:25,201
<i>he's holdin' the
board, looking the other way.</i>

185
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:27,201
so the nail gun
goes off, bam!

186
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,834
right through
the dude's cheek.

187
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,101
oh, fuck.

188
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:08,101
- passaic.
- what?

189
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,500
where i live.
you asked me.

190
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:12,401
right.

191
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:16,767
why you ask me that? you gonna
come over, take me on a date?

192
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,967
yeah, absolutely.

193
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:22,034
i got a son, hector.

194
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:23,533
he's three.

195
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,967
wow, that's cool.

196
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,368
you're gonna
call me, right?

197
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:43,001
hey-- there's
only six numbers.

198
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,867
i left
the last one off.

199
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:48,267
you wanna find me, you're
gonna have to work for it.

200
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:57,134
you have an emergency call on two.

201
00:15:57,201 --> 00:16:00,034
oh my god.
pop?

202
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:02,368
<i>guess who.</i>

203
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:05,001
- that's not funny.
- had to get your attention.

204
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:07,500
well you had my attention. now
you're wasting my time. i have to go.

205
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,967
hold on. you got a
warehouse listed on panama

206
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:14,267
that used to be a uniform
supply. what's the asking?

207
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:16,767
three and a quarter.
can i go now?

208
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:19,067
i was driving by. i thought
it had some potential.

209
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:20,934
but it's really
9,400 square feet

210
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:23,734
of leaky tarpaper roofs and
clotted galvanized plumbing

211
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,301
and no foot traffic
to speak of.

212
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:27,468
<i>ease up on the hard sell there.</i>

213
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,134
i'm thinking--

214
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:31,800
you get the seller to knock
something meaningful off the asking,

215
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:35,867
i fix it,
you flip it.

216
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:39,134
look, whatever happened, we did
make some money together, right?

217
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:44,067
- you serious about this?
- oh, you never do shit like that?

218
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,167
i'll get back to you.

219
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:57,334
<i>i was up for anything.</i>

220
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:59,034
he signed
the escrow papers

221
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,533
and i'm not sure
what happened

222
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,468
but he... left.

223
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:08,800
it was so
fucking humiliating

224
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:12,567
and i was so worked up. i
just needed to smooth it out.

225
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:14,934
so there's
the cristal.

226
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:20,800
i mean it could've been
worse, given my history.

227
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:22,867
it could've been junk.

228
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:25,567
julie, right?

229
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:28,734
- julianna.
- christopher.

230
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,633
i liked your share
in there, seriously.

231
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,700
i'm glad...
or sorry i guess.

232
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:36,500
kinda similar situation
with my job.

233
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:39,034
i really get that rush
when it's working.

234
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,667
i don't think i've ever
heard you share in there.

235
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:43,334
not a judgment,
by the way.

236
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:45,468
you learn as much
from others.

237
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:47,734
i split my time
at n.a. too.

238
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,567
junk's
another thing, huh?

239
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,600
tell me about it.

240
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:56,934
- you look familiar.
- pork store there, satriale's.

241
00:17:57,001 --> 00:18:00,800
oh, right.

242
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:05,234
wow, cool.
so i guess i'll see you.

243
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:08,533
or maybe next week,
here.

244
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,067
wait. you wanna go for coffee?

245
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,934
well... okay.

246
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:18,967
wanna follow me to that
dive on sip and jfk?

247
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:44,934
<i>for some
people, depression is a form</i>

248
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:48,001
<i>of forced
introversion.</i>

249
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,500
<i>and in lincoln's case,
it was extremely painful.</i>

250
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:54,234
<i>but it's out of that forced introversion</i>

251
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,633
<i>- that comes the abraham lincoln...
- where you been?</i>

252
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,434
<i>- linda merola's.
- ...who's the successful president.</i>

253
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,034
i left you a message. the
annual christmas toy drive.

254
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:05,533
- how was it? - it was
nice. we gave an x-box.

255
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,368
so, stan klimik
was there.

256
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:11,334
ruth's husband?
he works for kroll.

257
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,867
the private eyes?

258
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:14,667
he does
their computers.

259
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:16,533
anyway, i was telling
him about ade

260
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,867
and he said we should hire
professionals to track her down.

261
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:23,067
- carm-- - it's not as expensive
as you might think, tony.

262
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:24,667
he gave me his card.

263
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:27,900
look, it's not
about the money.

264
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:31,434
did you ever think that maybe it's
an intrusion into ade's personal life?

265
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,600
but what if she's
in trouble, tony?

266
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,368
stan said they had
this case once--

267
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:42,700
this guy ran out
on his child support.

268
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:46,468
he was a hiking
enthusiast, missing 12 years

269
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:50,167
and they tracked him down to a
watering station in the mojave desert.

270
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:02,001
carmela's spec house? i need you to
go lean on that building inspector.

271
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,800
- leave it alone, you said.
- do it today, for all our sakes.

272
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:07,767
my wife needs a career.

273
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:10,500
tony, hey.
seasons greetings.

274
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,734
good holidays
to your family, huh?

275
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,201
yeah, you too.

276
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:22,201
well it's bigger
than i thought.

277
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:25,134
i got close with a developer who
thought he could do apartments,

278
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:27,967
some light retail, but we
snagged on some zoning issues.

279
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:31,900
let me worry
about that.

280
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:36,567
so who's this fiancé
you were telling me about?

281
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:40,500
jesus, what the fuck
do you want here?

282
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:45,700
- just move on, huh?
- i was confused, okay?

283
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:47,600
- i'm not now.
- what a coincidence,

284
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:50,434
'cause that's exactly
how i feel.

285
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,500
take all the time you need.
just stick it in the lock box.

286
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,700
it's only
the latest draft.

287
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,600
guy who wrote it--
i met him at a meeting.

288
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,401
jt dolan,
big user.

289
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:12,500
you can tell.
it's relentless.

290
00:21:13,468 --> 00:21:15,600
yeah, it's a work
in progress.

291
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,867
i didn't mean it like that.
there's a lot in it.

292
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,700
are you sure about the title, "cleaver"?

293
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:24,567
the jerry mathers
connection?

294
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,934
rules of success for pictures like this?

295
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:31,001
one-word titles: "saw,"
"hostel," "cleaver."

296
00:21:32,368 --> 00:21:35,167
but michael-- he knows
it's the boss right away?

297
00:21:36,434 --> 00:21:38,334
you might want to make
more of a mystery out of it.

298
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:39,967
maybe.

299
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:44,667
this boss,
he's a really rough--

300
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:46,800
is anthony soprano
like that?

301
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:49,700
he's just a jumping-off
point for the character.

302
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:55,967
he's got some
similarness.

303
00:21:56,034 --> 00:21:57,767
like he thinks
everything's his.

304
00:21:57,834 --> 00:22:00,234
but it's not.

305
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,067
i can't get into it but
there are some rules.

306
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:09,234
thank you. don't get into
it. i don't wanna know.

307
00:22:11,468 --> 00:22:14,134
it's just weird, you know?
being where he's been.

308
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:17,067
he hasn't
been anywhere.

309
00:22:17,134 --> 00:22:18,734
nothing happened.
i told you that.

310
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,633
don't matter. he's
been there in his mind.

311
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,633
ugh. fine.

312
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,834
you're right. guy's got a lot
more on his mind than this.

313
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:43,434
like whether or not to
have that third sandwich.

314
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,667
i'm not a fucking
parking spot.

315
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:04,967
ow.

316
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:22,267
don't get me wrong, i
loved dom more than anybody.

317
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,867
my point is we don't know
if tony was behind this.

318
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:26,301
it was payback
for vito.

319
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:28,967
so why the fuck did they
blow up the wire room?

320
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:33,700
the balls
on this prick.

321
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,700
to blow up a store--
you call that balls?

322
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:37,201
balls is you look
a guy in the eye

323
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:39,034
while you jam an ice
pick through his lung.

324
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:41,401
i meant balls
as in "nerve," "gall."

325
00:23:41,468 --> 00:23:43,201
i know what
the fuck you meant.

326
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:46,067
far as i'm concerned,
this is like 9-11.

327
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:48,368
tony wanted our
attention. fine.

328
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:51,334
he got our attention. now
we wipe him off the planet.

329
00:23:51,401 --> 00:23:54,368
you know that fat cocksucker
says i look like the shah of iran?

330
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:57,533
- who does?
- tony.

331
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,934
- i never got that at all.
- fat piece of shit.

332
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:04,234
it's irrelevant, phil. but
he's testin' you all the time.

333
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:05,867
and you keep
indulging him.

334
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:09,301
you're right.

335
00:24:09,368 --> 00:24:14,301
but whack a boss?
i won't do that.

336
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:16,434
- it's been done before.
- and it was wrong then.

337
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,434
eye for an eye then, huh?
pick somebody over there.

338
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:29,967
white trash motherfuckers in narcotics
anonymous-- fucking "jerry springer show."

339
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:32,800
the fuck with
your whining tonight?

340
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,301
listen-- been involved
with this girl.

341
00:24:38,368 --> 00:24:40,334
in there-- that's
the place to share.

342
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:43,867
it's complicated.

343
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:47,334
remember that real estate agent tony
was dealing with? the jewish one?

344
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:50,167
fuckin' a. he planted
the flag. i'd back off.

345
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:51,934
no, he didn't
do shit, she said.

346
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:54,067
he wanted to and then
never pulled the trigger.

347
00:24:54,134 --> 00:24:56,267
okay, it's touchy
but okay.

348
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:59,368
i don't know if it's okay but fuck
him and what he don't know, you know?

349
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,600
so what's the problem?

350
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:07,867
she's in recovery.
junk.

351
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:11,567
her? fuckin' movie
of the week.

352
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:14,600
listen to me. that last run you went on,

353
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:18,167
beginning with the feast? how hard
you had to work to get back from that?

354
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:21,567
civilians-- their bosses
find out they slipped,

355
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:23,201
they get a plane ticket
to minnesota.

356
00:25:23,267 --> 00:25:26,001
tony will fuckin' mulch his
roses with what's left of you.

357
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,401
she's solid now.
years sober.

358
00:25:28,468 --> 00:25:30,201
we fuckin' met
at a meeting.

359
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:33,500
- that never happens to me.
- that's all you got to say?

360
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:35,401
schools
of thought:

361
00:25:35,468 --> 00:25:39,600
two of you together could be
enabling. bad habits shared.

362
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:41,567
but it's more like she
knows how bad it is.

363
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:43,401
we watch out
for each other.

364
00:25:43,468 --> 00:25:45,800
she wouldn't even let me
have red bull. seriously.

365
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:49,267
well that's the other school:
two are stronger than one.

366
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:50,934
i know i'm different
with her.

367
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:54,867
well i guess we
just keep an eye on it.

368
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:56,567
you fuckin'
lucky cocksucker.

369
00:25:56,633 --> 00:26:00,633
- another married man?
- i know.

370
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,500
and it gets worse.
i think he's connected.

371
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,533
to what?

372
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,767
- the mafia.
- no...

373
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:11,967
but-- actually i know he is because
i was involved with his boss.

374
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:15,734
you ever hear of
anthony soprano?

375
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,900
i'm sorry, jules. i don't even
know where to fucking start.

376
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:21,034
i know, i know.

377
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:23,533
the stupid thing is

378
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,567
he's sweet.
he's good to me.

379
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:28,900
i want you to listen
to this very carefully:

380
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:32,368
i'm your sponsor. i'm not
judging you. i'm not disappointed.

381
00:26:32,434 --> 00:26:35,834
i am concerned and i'm here
to help you help yourself.

382
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,834
unlike you, i've lived in
north jersey my whole life

383
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,401
and those people
like his boss--

384
00:26:41,468 --> 00:26:44,900
they are sociopaths.
murderers actually.

385
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:49,234
i know, ame, but i think you're
getting a little carried away.

386
00:26:49,301 --> 00:26:52,434
don't hug me. on top of
everything i'm getting a cold.

387
00:26:54,267 --> 00:26:56,167
cock--!

388
00:26:56,234 --> 00:26:58,434
<i>...sucker
motherfucker!</i>

389
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,334
<i>you shit asshole!
i hate you!</i>

390
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:02,667
this man is so lame.

391
00:27:04,934 --> 00:27:07,201
shit.

392
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:10,533
- what's wrong?
- these assholes again.

393
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
they wake up the baby.

394
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:20,834
shh! my baby's
sleeping.

395
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,034
why don't you come out here
and suck our dick?

396
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,468
hey what's this asshole's problem?

397
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:30,533
my ex used to go down and
kick their asses, but...

398
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,633
<i>...now they're back.</i>

399
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:38,567
okay, papi.
it's all right.

400
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:42,734
it's all right, baby.

401
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,767
shh.

402
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:53,468
fuckwads.

403
00:28:18,734 --> 00:28:22,368
look, you guys move.
go hang somewhere else,

404
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,334
i'll give you this bike.
it's a gary fisher.

405
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:28,767
it's only a year old. my parents
gave it to me last christmas.

406
00:28:34,734 --> 00:28:36,934
all right.

407
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:03,468
it doesn't bother you that
i'm younger than you are?

408
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:07,234
you know who was born on
your birthday? jesse ventura.

409
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:09,734
who?

410
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,767
he's a famous politician.
i looked it up.

411
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,101
how do you know
my birthday?

412
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:19,468
i did your w-4, remember?
the withholding?

413
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,301
you sure it don't
bother you i have a baby?

414
00:29:31,368 --> 00:29:34,267
no, i love kids.

415
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,267
this is fuckin' ridiculous.
you're not goin' no place.

416
00:29:42,334 --> 00:29:44,867
- i want to.
- we can watch a dvd.

417
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:47,533
i got the 50 cent movie
down in my trunk.

418
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,201
they were giving it away
at the car wash.

419
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:53,001
don't talk.

420
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:56,234
that's it. you're fuckin' grounded.

421
00:29:56,301 --> 00:29:58,434
lie down.

422
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:06,667
i'm gonna go down the
pharmacy, get some robitussin.

423
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:10,500
no! it's got
dextromethorphan.

424
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:13,900
what are you gonna do? rip your
fuckin' lungs out? this is crazy.

425
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:17,234
you certainly seem very anxious
to get cough medicine in here.

426
00:30:20,034 --> 00:30:21,567
i resent that.

427
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,034
fuck it! it's over the counter.
how much shit could be in it?

428
00:30:32,101 --> 00:30:34,633
unh-uh.

429
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,700
maybe you could get
some valerian tea.

430
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:49,234
you put eight, nine,
10 tea bags in a cup.

431
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:52,667
- fuck's that gonna do?
- it's equal to like taking a valium.

432
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:55,934
- i didn't know that.
- same chemical family.

433
00:30:57,767 --> 00:31:02,034
gotta have some cough
suppressant value, right?

434
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:04,734
worst-case scenario, it
might help you sleep at least.

435
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,834
what do you think?

436
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,700
valerian tea.

437
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:13,633
you have to go to
the health food store.

438
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:29,134
jesus christ, they didn't teach
you how to use a pair of pliers yet?

439
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:31,434
oh it smells
all christmassy in here.

440
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,900
yeah.

441
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:38,334
come on.

442
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:41,301
oh, the russos--
picture of their dogs.

443
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:43,967
it's sad with
no children.

444
00:31:51,633 --> 00:31:55,468
oh my god!
the building department.

445
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:57,967
they're repealing the stop-work
order on my spec house!

446
00:31:58,034 --> 00:32:00,134
"construction
may begin immediately."

447
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:03,667
tony, is this you? this is the best
christmas present i could ever get!

448
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:07,234
oh, i better return that
vacuum i got you then.

449
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,633
so, christmas eve--
besides the shrimp,

450
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,301
- i told desanto the
cherry-stones. - fine, good.

451
00:32:14,368 --> 00:32:16,700
you sure? 'cause last year you
said the cherry-stones were chewy.

452
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,401
the little-necks then.

453
00:32:18,468 --> 00:32:22,667
jesus! ebenezer scrooge
over here.

454
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:26,368
so stop breakin' my balls
about clams. i don't feel good.

455
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:32,533
the soft scrub,
lemon scented.

456
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,267
you're cool
as a cucumber.

457
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:40,201
did i say i'm hot?

458
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:43,067
i got a tightness in my
chest up by the esophagus.

459
00:32:43,134 --> 00:32:45,201
well you just had
a check up, phil.

460
00:32:46,434 --> 00:32:48,533
yeah.

461
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,900
imagine the christmas marie and the
kids'll be having after all that with vito?

462
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:55,468
the dibellas too.

463
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:56,934
catherine's stroke?

464
00:32:57,001 --> 00:32:59,167
remember last year
at my mother's house?

465
00:32:59,234 --> 00:33:03,767
francesca spatafore did that
beautiful solo of "o, holy night"?

466
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:06,633
vito accompanied her
on the piano?

467
00:33:07,734 --> 00:33:10,301
i gotta try
and take a shit.

468
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:13,368
now when one is having a heart
attack, the body releases proteins

469
00:33:13,434 --> 00:33:15,700
that act as markers which
we would detect in the blood.

470
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:17,301
you don't show
any, sir.

471
00:33:17,368 --> 00:33:19,267
- so, his heart is fine?
- yep.

472
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:21,134
jesus christ.

473
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:24,101
mr. leotardo, some people would
pay millions for that diagnosis.

474
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:27,101
- so what the hell's wrong with me?
- my guess is simple gas.

475
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:28,800
i always say
he's full of hot air.

476
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:30,468
pharmacy's down
the hall.

477
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:33,967
they will give you
some antacid. take care.

478
00:33:34,034 --> 00:33:36,067
arrogant prick.

479
00:33:36,134 --> 00:33:39,434
nervous nellie.
that's what you are.

480
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:54,267
i'm so sorry.

481
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:56,101
this asshole
wall street couple

482
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,834
came back to look
at this loft space.

483
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,967
mmm.

484
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:57,401
- i'm dyin'. my heart!
- oh my god!

485
00:34:59,034 --> 00:35:01,201
<i>okay, we're here. we're here.</i>

486
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,101
<i>it's all right, it's all right.
it's okay. don't worry about it.</i>

487
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:06,633
help! my husband.

488
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,567
- phil!
- crash cart! can i get a crash cart? crash cart!

489
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,934
heh, i fucked a girl
wearing a santa hat once.

490
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:23,001
it was too distracting.
i kept losin' my hard on.

491
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:24,867
hey ton'.
did you hear?

492
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:28,167
phil leotardo took a heart
attack, a big one apparently.

493
00:35:28,234 --> 00:35:31,900
ho! so there is
a santa claus.

494
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:36,167
he's in intensive care over in
brooklyn. doesn't look too good.

495
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,101
sweetheart,
drinks all around.

496
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:41,967
and a club soda
for the messenger here.

497
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:44,267
you're happy
about this, t?

498
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:47,167
why not? he's a pain
in my balls.

499
00:35:47,234 --> 00:35:50,401
a manageable pain though,
eh? the devil you know...

500
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:52,267
after the scene
at little carmine's...?

501
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,900
corrado,
don't you have nothing?

502
00:35:57,967 --> 00:35:59,834
you can make
a hand turkey.

503
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,633
for christmas?
fuckin' idiot.

504
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:07,267
visitor for
mr. soprano.

505
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,600
bobby!

506
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:22,500
any of you know
what bacala is?

507
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:24,334
of course you don't.

508
00:36:24,401 --> 00:36:26,468
well it's salted cod.

509
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:28,067
we taught the world
how to eat.

510
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:32,101
junior, sit.

511
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:40,134
happy holidays, huh?

512
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:42,034
you smell the piss
in this place?

513
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:44,234
i ain't gonna stay
too long.

514
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,700
just to say you
should keep this.

515
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:51,468
- what's that?
- you had beppy drop it by, remember?

516
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:54,368
had a post-it?
it said "merry christmas"?

517
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:57,834
it's a gift.

518
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,633
it's a little something for
you and karen and the kids.

519
00:37:01,867 --> 00:37:03,867
it wouldn't be right.

520
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:06,468
i mean frankly i shouldn't be
here after what happened with tony.

521
00:37:06,533 --> 00:37:08,667
he's still up
on his cross, huh?

522
00:37:08,734 --> 00:37:11,468
junior, you shot him.

523
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:13,900
yeah well it's
not that simple.

524
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:16,067
i know a few
things you don't.

525
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:18,267
like maybe i wasn't
acting alone.

526
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:20,468
junior, jfk was
40 years ago.

527
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:22,900
that's all i'll
say about that.

528
00:37:24,734 --> 00:37:26,900
you see that one
over there?

529
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:31,034
an attorney.
i'm mounting my case.

530
00:37:31,101 --> 00:37:34,067
look, i should
take off.

531
00:37:34,134 --> 00:37:35,934
you want a snack?
a soda?

532
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:37,700
the fuck? you
just got here.

533
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:41,800
happy holidays.

534
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:01,034
here.

535
00:38:01,101 --> 00:38:03,034
one hand washes
the other.

536
00:38:03,101 --> 00:38:05,934
so the husband says, "i
wasn't talkin' to you."

537
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:30,234
you know her?

538
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:33,401
oh that's right,
you and her--

539
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:35,567
- how'd that all go?
- i had to put her on the shelf.

540
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,533
yeah, she's a friend of kaisha, the
black one i was tellin' you about.

541
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:48,468
she was just now asking what
to get kaisha for her birthday.

542
00:38:50,301 --> 00:38:52,468
what'd you tell her?

543
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:54,533
luther vandross,
a box set.

544
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,934
mmm.

545
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,834
mmm.

546
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:47,867
you know what's
interesting?

547
00:39:47,934 --> 00:39:50,600
hmm?

548
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:54,767
us being able
to use again,

549
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:57,368
but integrating it
into our lives.

550
00:39:57,434 --> 00:40:00,101
yeah.

551
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:03,533
work...

552
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,301
socialize...

553
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:12,533
but still having
a mastery.

554
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,834
- not easy.
- but interesting as shit.

555
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:33,001
for one thing,
we don't use needles.

556
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,201
i should probably tell
tony we're fucking.

557
00:40:55,734 --> 00:41:00,368
what?
we're not anymore.

558
00:41:00,434 --> 00:41:02,167
he's already hinky.

559
00:41:04,134 --> 00:41:06,533
he starts pokin'
around,

560
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,900
finds out
we met in a.a.,

561
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,201
he could suspect
i'm usin' again...

562
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:16,900
hmm.

563
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:20,067
...and ruin everything.

564
00:41:51,267 --> 00:41:53,500
there he is. where the fuck you been?

565
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:55,267
you heard that phil
had surgery now?

566
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:58,368
turds in the aorta--
a medical first.

567
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:00,201
gotta see
my chiropodist.

568
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,234
t...

569
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:04,500
there's something
i should tell you.

570
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:15,201
- the real estate agent.
- yeah?

571
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:17,101
i've been bangin' her.

572
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:24,667
see, i knew some shit
was goin' on.

573
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,434
why the fuck
did you lie to me?

574
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,767
i wasn't sure how it ended with you two

575
00:42:30,834 --> 00:42:32,767
till you
set me straight.

576
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:35,167
stupid, right?

577
00:42:35,234 --> 00:42:38,101
point is i want
everything above-boards

578
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:40,967
as always between
you and me.

579
00:42:41,034 --> 00:42:42,800
i don't give a fuck.

580
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:45,667
do what you want
with her.

581
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,201
- this is my reward.
- your reward.

582
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:53,934
i do not betray
my wife.

583
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:57,234
i go out of my way not to
have an affair with this woman,

584
00:42:57,301 --> 00:43:00,001
this very hot,

585
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:02,734
very beautiful,
intelligent woman--

586
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,468
'cause of the way carmela
nursed me and cared for me.

587
00:43:06,533 --> 00:43:08,767
and my fuckin' turkey-neck
of a nephew

588
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:10,434
winds up with his dick
in there.

589
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,368
a guy i gotta see
every day.

590
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:15,600
this is my reward.

591
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,434
frankly, i'm encouraged.

592
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,334
with the fuckin'
riddles again.

593
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:23,034
i sat here dreading
the end of the story

594
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,567
would involve
you erupting

595
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:28,034
in some act of violence
towards your nephew.

596
00:43:28,101 --> 00:43:29,633
well, christmas
isn't over yet.

597
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,767
you came out
of that shooting

598
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:34,234
feeling each day
as a gift.

599
00:43:34,301 --> 00:43:36,600
well, this is
a corollary to that.

600
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:39,101
a what?

601
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:42,867
you don't have to eat
every dish of rigatoni.

602
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:45,600
you don't have to fuck
every female you meet.

603
00:43:50,468 --> 00:43:54,334
you know what i've
been realizing?

604
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:57,267
these women-- they're
all sort of the same--

605
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,734
dark complexion,
smart,

606
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,468
they smell a little
bit of money.

607
00:44:03,533 --> 00:44:07,633
there's you and...
gloria

608
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,900
and this "ashkenuzi."

609
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:13,600
so what's that about?

610
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:15,700
what do you think
it's about?

611
00:44:21,834 --> 00:44:24,134
well...

612
00:44:24,201 --> 00:44:26,301
it's probably the
reason i still come here

613
00:44:26,368 --> 00:44:28,700
to hang out with you--

614
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:31,434
'cause nothing really
changes with the therapy part.

615
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,734
ton'? that fed's
out front. harris.

616
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,368
says he wants you to know
he's here having a sandwich.

617
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,500
what's the matter?
not enough mayo?

618
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,500
tony, how you doing?

619
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:40,934
good, so how's
the war on terror?

620
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:44,567
christmas is always
potentially our busy season.

621
00:45:44,633 --> 00:45:47,834
so, phil leotardo, huh?
coronary?

622
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,101
i swear to god i had
nothin' to do with that.

623
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:53,700
just so you know,

624
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:56,067
i'm still in touch with
some agents who work o.c.

625
00:45:56,134 --> 00:45:58,734
from what they hear, you're not
very popular in brooklyn right now.

626
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,234
so what else
is new, huh?

627
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:03,834
that someone close to you
may be in danger.

628
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,001
really?
anybody specific?

629
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:12,500
all they know is it's under
serious discussion at top levels.

630
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,067
- thanks.
- it's christmas.

631
00:46:41,867 --> 00:46:43,767
what? you want me to call a doctor?

632
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:46,800
cramping in my legs?
it could be anything.

633
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:48,401
well then what'd
you call me for?

634
00:46:48,468 --> 00:46:50,834
- just to say hi.
- but you're all right?

635
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,533
yeah.
i'll see you later.

636
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,267
bring me home
a quattro formaggi.

637
00:46:57,334 --> 00:46:59,167
i don't care what
time it is. wake me up.

638
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:01,267
- all right.
- mwah.

639
00:47:11,434 --> 00:47:12,934
we were talking
about recovery

640
00:47:13,001 --> 00:47:15,134
and your organized
crime thing.

641
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:17,567
that i took an oath

642
00:47:17,633 --> 00:47:19,567
that was a sacred oath.

643
00:47:19,633 --> 00:47:24,034
- that's not an urban legend?
- no, you burn a saint.

644
00:47:24,101 --> 00:47:27,867
you draw blood-- but technically i
shouldn't even be tellin' you this.

645
00:47:27,934 --> 00:47:31,234
ooh.

646
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:33,767
the program--

647
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:36,334
i could never really get
into the "higher power" part.

648
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:39,900
well, me neither.
it's hard.

649
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:43,134
i mostly think of the group
consciousness as a higher power.

650
00:47:43,201 --> 00:47:47,800
i said to myself that that
oath would be my higher power.

651
00:47:47,867 --> 00:47:49,567
that would be
my strength.

652
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,700
that code-- that's
a soldier's oath.

653
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:55,767
- i could see that.
- but the problem is nobody lives it no more.

654
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:57,434
not tony, not nobody.

655
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,334
they let you down.

656
00:48:03,134 --> 00:48:06,667
whatever...
here i am.

657
00:48:06,734 --> 00:48:09,101
- using.
- using.

658
00:48:15,401 --> 00:48:16,934
are you breaking up
with me?

659
00:48:21,234 --> 00:48:23,134
no.

660
00:48:33,934 --> 00:48:35,834
should we go to
a meeting?

661
00:48:37,734 --> 00:48:40,301
i don't know.

662
00:48:40,368 --> 00:48:42,468
what do you wanna do?

663
00:48:44,867 --> 00:48:47,401
i know one that starts in
half an hour in glen ridge.

664
00:49:20,301 --> 00:49:21,834
take one car?

665
00:49:23,368 --> 00:49:25,234
i'll follow you.

666
00:49:37,867 --> 00:49:39,633
you should've
called first.

667
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,767
how's john?

668
00:49:55,834 --> 00:49:57,267
some christmas
present, huh?

669
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,633
i'll see you in the morn--

670
00:50:06,434 --> 00:50:08,134
i'll see you
in the morning.

671
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:10,567
god loves you.

672
00:50:28,001 --> 00:50:31,434
finally got you to come
to brooklyn, cocksucker.

673
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:41,800
listen to me.

674
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:55,967
now i never told
nobody this,

675
00:50:56,034 --> 00:51:00,667
but while i was
in that coma,

676
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,633
somethin' happened
to me.

677
00:51:06,967 --> 00:51:08,867
i went someplace,

678
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:15,001
i think. but i know i
never wanna go back there.

679
00:51:17,434 --> 00:51:19,700
and maybe you know
what i'm talkin' about.

680
00:51:28,134 --> 00:51:30,301
believe me, nobody ever
laid on their deathbed

681
00:51:30,368 --> 00:51:32,500

now you take your time.

683
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,468
you get better.

684
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:47,368
and you get out
of this fuckin' place.

685
00:51:47,434 --> 00:51:51,134
but when you do,
you focus on grandkids

686
00:51:51,201 --> 00:51:54,034
and good things.

687
00:51:54,101 --> 00:51:57,167
