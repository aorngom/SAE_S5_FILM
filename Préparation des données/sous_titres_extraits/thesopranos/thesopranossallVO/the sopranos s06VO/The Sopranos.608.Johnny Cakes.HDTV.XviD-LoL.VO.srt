1
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:34,167
are you all right?

2
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:36,034
yeah!

3
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,100
keep going!

4
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,733
are you sure
you're all right?

5
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
the incision?

6
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:02,967
<i>you're listening to
the stations of member-supported</i>

00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:29,634
it's nice
having this again.

12
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:34,534
well, it's supposed
to be better than "nice."

13
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:36,634
you know what i mean.

14
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,234
after that nightmare,
god, we are blessed, tony.

15
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:42,234
yeah.

16
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:53,267
a.j.'s practicing?

17
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:56,467
that's a first.

18
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,167
i'll let you know.

19
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,000
- all right.
- all right, thanks, man.

20
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:15,267
your amigos
with the baggy pants--

21
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:17,267
hope you kept 'em
away from the silver.

22
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:19,467
oh, jesus, they're musicians, all right?

23
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,867
they saw an ad
for the drums.

24
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:23,867
you're selling
your drums?

25
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:26,267
i need cash. i don't play 'em anymore.

26
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:28,601
those drums were a gift
from your father.

27
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:30,434
yeah, i don't
wanna sell 'em.

28
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,767
and if you guys hadn't made
me get such a crappy job,

29
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,934
- i wouldn't have to.
- this is our fault?

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,100
i'm wasting my time
at blockbuster.

31
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:39,367
why don't you get off your
ass and find another job?

32
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:42,501
what about community college? you
said you were gonna go back to school.

33
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:44,767
okay, for the
hundredth time:

34
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:48,700
i can't register
until second semester!

35
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:51,167
- oh!
- jesus christ!

36
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:52,700
i do what you
guys want,

37
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:54,934

some kind of life?

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,568
please, move back!

39
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,301
jim, we need a crew on the
roof to ventilate. let's go!

40
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:23,534
i can't find gareth. i think
he's still in the house.

41
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:25,467
<i>son of a bitch. we'll get him.</i>

42
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:28,634
<i>- oh god, gareth!
- we'll get him, sarah. we'll get him.</i>

43
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,034
<i>- it'll be all right, sarah.
- come on, guys, go go go!</i>

44
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,467

45
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:38,434
<i>- look, look!
- that window!</i>

46
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:41,800
<i>- i got it!
- oh-- oh god!</i>

47
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:44,367
i got her kid.

48
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:46,267
<i>all right, whoo!</i>

49
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:02,334
you want another one?

50
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:04,434
yeah, sure.

51
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:30,967
so uncle jun'--

52
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:34,501
what are we gonna do
about him?

53
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:40,900
he's incarcerated for the
rest of his unnatural life.

54
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,833
so fuck him.

55
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,167
he's a walking corpse.

56
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:46,367
yeah, but, dad,
what he did to you--

57
00:05:46,434 --> 00:05:49,634
certainly nothing
for you to worry about.

58
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:37,267
"manager dale." welcome
to the neighborhood.

59
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:40,267
we're from the north ward
merchants protective cooperative.

60
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,267
i'm kinda busy. you guys
looking for a donation?

61
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:44,800
- let him finish.
- you may have noticed,

62
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:47,634
not to denigrate anyone, but this
is a transitional neighborhood.

63
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,034
i mean, demographically speaking, you
still have a lot of marginal types.

64
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,900
we merchants have found
you really should

65
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:56,301
have some round-the-clock
security here.

66
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:59,134
- isn't that what the police are for?
- they do their best,

67
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:00,867
but they got
their hands full.

68
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:03,367
your weekly dues to us will
give you all the supplemental

69
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:06,501
- safety net you'll ever need.
- i can't authorize anything like that.

70
00:07:06,568 --> 00:07:08,634
it have to go through
corporate in seattle.

71
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,668
we merchants prefer to deal
on a personal one-on-one basis.

72
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,733
i don't have any
discretionary funds.

73
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,401
it's gotta go
through corporate.

74
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:18,634
how do you think corporate
would feel if--

75
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,034
for the sake of argument, someone
threw a brick through your window?

76
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,234
they've got 10,000 stores
in north america.

77
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:26,034
i don't thk
they'd feel anything.

78
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,634
what if, god forbid,
it wasn't just vandalism?

79
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,900
what if an employee,

80
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:34,601
even the manager say,
was assaulted?

81
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:41,668
look, every last
fucking coffee bean

82
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:44,100
is in the computer
and has to be accounted for.

83
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:48,467
the numbers don't add up, i'll be
gone and somebody else will be here.

84
00:07:57,934 --> 00:07:59,967
it's over
for the little guy.

85
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:05,700
vince, good morning.
how's your book coming?

86
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,668
okay.

87
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:10,967
you're always welcome to join
the other guests for breakfast.

88
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:13,767
thad says if your dishwasher
is newer than five years,

89
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,800
you don't need to use
the pre-rinse cycle.

90
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:18,467
the fact is i don't recommend
it. i can trick the sensors

91
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:21,733
into thinking that the dishes
are cleaner than they really are.

92
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,668
i gotta go write.
thanks.

93
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:29,700
morning.

94
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:46,568
jason masucci was down in
tampa visiting his mother,

95
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:50,000
thought he saw vito
in a jenny craig.

96
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:52,634
turned out to be some
other fat piece of shit.

97
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,767
if that fag ever
does come back,

98
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,367
we should have
carlo do it.

99
00:08:57,434 --> 00:08:58,934
be good
with all the crews.

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,067
excuse me? you were all hot to trot.

101
00:09:02,134 --> 00:09:05,301
i got enough complications
in my life.

102
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:07,334
feds up my ass.

103
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:09,334
for business reasons,
okay,

104
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:11,501
but for political
correctness?

105
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:14,367
ooh, check it out.

106
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:17,467
i could do that,
no problem.

107
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:19,367
wait here.
i'll get your viagra.

108
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,800
let me tell you something, for
two months after the shooting,

109
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:24,867
as far as snatch
was concerned,

110
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:27,334
didn't even have a hard-on
when i woke up in the morning.

111
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:31,000
- like sil.
- bullet didn't fuck with the plumbing though.

112
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:32,934
no no, thank god.

113
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,100
it's just the effects
of the physical trauma.

114
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:37,367
doc said it was part
of the healing process.

115
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:39,867
i must be healed now
because i got a baguette

116
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:42,034
in my pants now 24/7.

117
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,534
affirmation of life.

118
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:48,067
hey, she's coming
this way.

119
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:52,000
put money in the meter
or something.

120
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:55,568
anthony soprano.

121
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:57,967
- yeah.
- julianna skiff,

122
00:09:58,034 --> 00:10:00,733
<i>century 21.
you got a minute?</i>

123
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,733
sure.

124
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,367
cannoli?

125
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:07,668
no, thank you.

126
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,733
you own the building at 217
franklin, right around the corner,

127
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,301
currently occupied
by caputo live poultry.

128
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:15,167
i represent
the jamba juice company.

129
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:17,501
they're interested
in purchasing the property.

130
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:19,534
jamba juice...

131
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:21,733
wants to put a store
in around here?

132
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,401
well, you must have noticed
the area's on an upswing.

133
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:26,668
you know the old glove
factory across the park,

134
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:29,000
over by the cathedral,
beautiful renovation.

135
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:31,000
i just bought
a loft there myself.

136
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:34,434
person like yourself's a wonderful
addition to the neighborhood.

137
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:41,301
jamba juice is willing
to pay $175 a square foot.

138
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:44,467
public records show the
building at 1,800 square feet.

139
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:47,900
so that makes a purchase
price of $315,000.

140
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:50,201
you ever buy eggs
from caputo?

141
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:53,234
frankly, i'm not wild
about the smell in there.

142
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:55,634
let me tell ya, his eggs
taste 10 times better

143
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,201
than any of the ones you get in
the supermarket. chickens too.

144
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,534
businesses relocate
all the time.

145
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:04,867
no, this would be a real loss
for the neighborhood.

146
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:06,934
don't you live out
in north caldwell?

147
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,434
yeah, my family made
the trek up guinea gulch.

148
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:12,467
bloomfield avenue.

149
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:15,034
but my roots here
go way back.

150
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,034
my grandfather came from avellino
like most of the people around here,

151
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,467
and i grew up right over there. my
father was an early community leader.

152
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:25,167
mm-hmm.

153
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:29,034
how about you?
where're you from?

154
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,700
upstate new york.

155
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:33,668
- binghamton.
- how'd you wind up here?

156
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:37,167
my parents have
a catering business,

157
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:40,167
something to leave
to the kids, right?

158
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:43,601
only i didn't see myself making
salisbury steak for the next 30 years.

159
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:45,601
so i left home at 17.

160
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:49,134
- rebellious.
- just a low tolerance for boredom.

161
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:53,568
so interested,
not interested?

162
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:56,501
i'm interested.

163
00:11:56,568 --> 00:11:58,501
but as far as
the property's concerned,

164
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:00,700
175 a square foot's
a little low.

165
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,401
and...

166
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:07,467
i don't wanna sell out
from under the guy.

167
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,900
good morning, vince.

168
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:22,100
the usual?

169
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:25,534
- been dreaming of those johnny cakes.
- can't beat jim's johnny cakes.

170
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:27,634
i saw you at
the fire last night.

171
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,668
you got balls, my friend.

172
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:32,601
you don't get paid
for that, right?

173
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,668
we're all volunteers.

174
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,934
back where i come from,
you join the fire department

175
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
<i>to steal shit
from people's bedrooms.</i>

176
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:41,833
- how's the book coming?
- it's fucking slow today.

177
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,367
<i>- writer's block, huh?
- let's just say i like eating a lot more than writing.</i>

178
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:47,367
and you don't help any.

179
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,867
everything you make
is fucking delicious.

180
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:52,434
you know...

181
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:54,634
i don't know
how you do it.

182
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,634
i can't even
write a letter.

183
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,100
i saw graziano
fight sugar ray in 1952.

184
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:02,067
<i>i took a train
to chicago.</i>

185
00:13:02,134 --> 00:13:05,100
maybe you should
interview me.

186
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,800
maybe i will.

187
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:09,568
i thought you were writing
a book about rocky marciano.

188
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,334
well, you can't talk about
one without the other.

189
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:17,167
<i>marciano--</i>

190
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:19,467
now that was
a tragic death.

191
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:23,000
now what was the year he
fought joe louis-- '49?

192
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,367
yeah.

193
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:27,201
actually, i think
it was '51.

194
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:30,367
when you told me you
were writing a book,

195
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,367
i looked him up
on the internet.

196
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:34,700
i don't know where
my fucking head is today.

197
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:37,668
maybe you're working
too hard.

198
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,568
yeah.

199
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:44,767
it must be lonely
sometimes-- being a writer.

200
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:48,267
you get used to it.

201
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:50,467
hey, dad, i left my
science project in the back.

202
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:54,334
don't lose
my glue gun.

203
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:03,367
<i>hey, mrs. conte.
¿como esta?</i>

204
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:06,800
- how's the hip?
- hey, anthony. i need your help.

205
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,900
- what?
- those nigger fucking whores,

206
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,900
they play that
music so loud.

207
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:14,367
now that's not nice. those
are puerto ricans, mrs. conte.

208
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:16,367
i ask 'em nice
to turn it down.

209
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:19,668
they tell me
to go fuck myself.

210
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,434
- i'll see what i can do.
- thanks.

211
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:27,601
- hey, how's junior? tell him i said hello.
- yeah.

212
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,467
you know, i been
meaning to ask you,

213
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:48,501
chicken or the egg?
you wanna weigh in?

214
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:50,301
that same stupid joke,
huh?

215
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,434
- how are you?
- good good.

216
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:55,267
<i>so how's business?
mezzo mezz'?</i>

217
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:58,201
- believe it or not, better than ever.
- glad to hear it.

218
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:00,201
i'll have to raise
your rent.

219
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,733
see, when you hold
your knife with your blade

220
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,067
facing your opponent, you
got a lot better control.

221
00:15:11,134 --> 00:15:12,833
plus, you protect
the forearm.

222
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,501
no, if you got the tip pointing
at him, you get more distance.

223
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:17,534
you could swipe his abdomen
and fucking gut him.

224
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:20,501
see, that's stupid. look how
your range of motion is limited.

225
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:23,201
it's so easy for him to step
back, grab your fucking arm,

226
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:25,934
- take your knife away.
- could someone please check us out?

227
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,234
yo, hernan.

228
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,700
sure, what time?

229
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:40,067
cool.

230
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:42,234
no problem.
i can cover tonight.

231
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:45,668
<i>- i'm totally
fucking minted. later.</i>

232
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,700
yeah?

233
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,967
i'm at work.
what do you think?

234
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:53,967
he stepped on a nail?

235
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:55,467
fuck.

236
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:58,867
how far did it
go in?

237
00:15:58,934 --> 00:16:01,034
- fuck!
- would you mind?

238
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,967
i better call
you back. bye.

239
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,367
that was hernan?

240
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,900
he was such a dick
in high school.

241
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:13,267
well, he was a senior.
what do you expect?

242
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:15,634
they always shit
on the underclassmen.

243
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:19,833
the kid spds
every night

244
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,000
in some fucking club
in new york,

245
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:25,034
sleeps till noon, puts in a
couple hours at blockbuster,

246
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,401
and that's it.

247
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:29,934
and since my injury,
like i told you,

248
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,668
i've been more,
you know...

249
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,867
accepting. be grateful
for what you got.

250
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:40,201
but maybe that's wrong.
maybe i should be on the kid.

251
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,733
my dad would have kicked my
lazy ass out of the house.

252
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,367
really?

253
00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:49,733
it's the chopping off
of the guy's finger, right?

254
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,000
i never should have told you 'cause
that's all you fixate on with him.

255
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:56,767
can you empathize
with a.j. at that age?

256
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:00,301
yeah, i had some
problems at school,

257
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:02,534
but i didn't vegetate.

258
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:06,000
- what?
- these are different times.

259
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:10,034
people today are bombarded
with so much information,

260
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,267
so much input
of every kind.

261
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:16,434
consequently,
true adulthood

262
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:17,934
is delayed.

263
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,434
sociologists say
that 26

264
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:24,100
is in fact
the new 21.

265
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,201
and the new 26
is what?

266
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:31,267
i'm 46, so that means
i'm what, 35?

267
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,134
my father isn't
an old man.

268
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:40,934
it's ridiculous to let
himself disintegrate like this.

269
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:47,234
how's it going
with patient soprano?

270
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:53,867
- what?
- i'm talking about my father, elliot.

271
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,534
- i thought you were done.
- it happens too often.

272
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:59,800
i think that's
a non-sequitur accusation.

273
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:02,733
why don't you just
admit he's a gangster?

274
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,568
he was gunned down,
and you're into it

275
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:08,100
on a tabloid level.

276
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:11,434
you devoted quite a chunk
of last visit to him.

277
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:13,668
i'm responding to that.

278
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:16,234
nothing's changed, okay?

279
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:20,334
he refuses to really engage
on this trauma the uncle caused.

280
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:22,301
and i think it's just
a matter of time

281
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,800
before he totally
decompensates.

282
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:29,900
has he cried
or reported crying

283
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:33,000
at all about
this man buster?

284
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:35,034
junior, no.

285
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
hmm.

286
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:40,934
<i>this omerta concept</i>

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,334
comes from
a pre-therapeutic culture.

288
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:47,367
<i>this isn't omerta.</i>

289
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:49,934
it's something else.

290
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:12,700
hey, man...
park it in the garage

291
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,900
on 14th street,
not the other shithole.

292
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:17,367
watch for potholes.

293
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:19,301
what's going on, man?

294
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,900
how's it going?
good to see you.

295
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:28,267
his dad's
really a gangster?

296
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,967
<i>capo di tutti capi.</i>

297
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:32,967
what's that mean?

298
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:35,134
- how old are you?
- 20.

299
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:38,134
- shut up.
- 15.

300
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:40,367
- how old are you?
- 18.

301
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:45,401
when i take "e,"
my feet get cold.

302
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,401
that ever happen
to you?

303
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:49,000
i wear special socks.

304
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,634
let's go uptown to my
crib and get more twisted,

305
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,434
if that's possible.

306
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:56,967
- oh, it's possible.
- i could give you a massage.

307
00:19:57,034 --> 00:20:00,067
<i>yeah. yeah, you could.</i>

308
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,167
oh, yeah, all right.

309
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,401
we all good?

310
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:14,401
yeah, it's cool.

311
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:29,900
mr. soprano,
zasu said to tell you

312
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,967
he's honored to
have you in the club.

313
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:36,601
and please,
regards to your dad.

314
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,967
okay.

315
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:43,134
oh, yeah, right.

316
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,367
what can i do
for you, phil?

317
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:54,000
vito.

318
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:56,467
do we know
where he's at?

319
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:59,000
well, that really
doesn't concern you.

320
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:00,800
how's john?

321
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:04,000
i don't know. fine,
through his veil of tears.

322
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:06,034
but seriously,

323
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,800
vito, what's being
done about him?

324
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,134
like i just said, it's none
of your fucking business

325
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:13,967
- 'cause he works for me, not you.
- he's married to my cousin.

326
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:16,334
he dishonored me
personally.

327
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,501
what do you want me to do,
put out an a.p.b. on the guy

328
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,467
'cause he takes it
up the ass, huh?

329
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:22,634
it's a victimless crime.

330
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,201
marie is a victim.
her children are victims.

331
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:27,334
they've done nothing.

332
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:29,367
and they're forced
to live with the shame

333
00:21:29,434 --> 00:21:32,967
and humiliation.
i gotta be frank,

334
00:21:33,034 --> 00:21:34,767
in your father's day,

335
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,401
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

336
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:40,634
<i>a finook in his crew,
he knew how to handle that.</i>

337
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,034
i sympathize with marie

338
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
and the children, okay?

339
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:49,733
<i>but don't you fucking tell me what
to do. you're only acting boss.</i>

340
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,267
i swallowed my pride when
your murdering fuck of a cousin

341
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:55,234
killed my brother.

342
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:57,000
don't think i'm
gonna do it twice.

343
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:01,601
phillip, let's not make a
beef where there isn't one.

344
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:04,301
fundamentally,
we are in agreement

345
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:07,534
on this issue,
but i'll handle it.

346
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:15,833
you know, i saw you on tv when
your grandfather shot your dad.

347
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,733
and now we're
like friends.

348
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,733
- that's so weird.
- right.

349
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,401
so what's gonna happen to
him, your grandfather, i mean?

350
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,234
he's my great-uncle.

351
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:28,067
so isn't your dad
gonna do something?

352
00:22:28,134 --> 00:22:29,833
<i>you know, the "omerto"?</i>

353
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:33,501
we don't talk about that
with outsiders.

354
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:35,700
cool, but i mean,

355
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:38,301
he's not just gonna let
him get away with it, is he?

356
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,100
i'll probably
have to do something.

357
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,000
really?

358
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:47,334
you're so intense.

359
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,267
you probably left it
in the car, thad.

360
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:53,267
no, it was
on the bedside table.

361
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:56,201
- i was charging it.
- you're always losing something.

362
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:58,201
last week it was
the sunglasses.

363
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:01,000
he left them on the counter
at the t.c.b.y.

364
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:03,501
- what did you lose?
- cell phone.

365
00:23:03,568 --> 00:23:06,134
i didn't lose it. i was
charging the damn thing.

366
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:08,767
tell you what i do--
try to retrace my steps.

367
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:12,833
it was
on the bedside table.

368
00:23:16,534 --> 00:23:18,301
- hello.
- hey, it's me.

369
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:21,934
- where are you? who's thad mccone?
- some guy.

370
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,334
<i>- oh, my god, vito.
- not that.</i>

371
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:29,067
i'm just borrowing
his phone.

372
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:32,234
listen, marie,

373
00:23:32,301 --> 00:23:34,967
i'm sorry all this
had to happen.

374
00:23:35,034 --> 00:23:37,501
i never meant
to hurt you.

375
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:39,967
come back, vito.
just come back.

376
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:43,568
it's a little more
complicated than that.

377
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:45,733
please, phil said
it'll be all right.

378
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,201
we could get you help. we
could get you psychiatric help.

379
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:52,000
phil? i trust him
least of all.

380
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:55,434
how can you say that?
he's family.

381
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:58,534
- he loves you.
- not anymore, believe me.

382
00:23:58,601 --> 00:24:00,568
but i've been
reading online,

383
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:02,601
there are these
church groups.

384
00:24:02,668 --> 00:24:04,434
they could cure you
of this.

385
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:07,467
- marie-- - well, what are
you gonna do, never come home?

386
00:24:07,534 --> 00:24:10,634
i'm working on that.

387
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,800
in the meantime, you're
gonna need some cash.

388
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:16,234
i need you, vito.
i need my husband.

389
00:24:16,301 --> 00:24:20,434
listen to me, in the den
behind the elliptical trainer,

390
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,767
the baseboard comes off.

391
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:26,601
there's 30k in there.

392
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,267
you know, marie,

393
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:34,900
<i>- you would like it here.
- tell me where.</i>

394
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:37,201
i'll bring the kids.
we'll relocate.

395
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,067
i gotta go.

396
00:24:39,134 --> 00:24:41,334
don't you wanna talk
to frannie or little v?

397
00:24:43,201 --> 00:24:45,434
yeah, okay.

398
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:47,167
put 'em on.

399
00:24:47,234 --> 00:24:50,067
vito, your father's
on the phone.

400
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:52,234
he wants to talk to you.

401
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:58,034
hi, dad.

402
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,767
hey there, champ,
you been good?

403
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,767
you been behaving?

404
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,800
<i>yeah, you know...</i>

405
00:25:07,301 --> 00:25:11,334
- dad?
- i gotta go.

406
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:16,733
you take care
of your moth, okay?

407
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:37,434
mr. soprano.

408
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:39,534
- hey.
- hi.

409
00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:42,534
- good news.
- how'd you know to find me here?

410
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:44,067
i'm a real estate agent.

411
00:25:44,134 --> 00:25:46,900
uh-oh.

412
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:48,900
can i buy you
a drink?

413
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:52,534
uh, sure.

414
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:54,568
ginger ale with
lime juice, please.

415
00:25:55,668 --> 00:25:57,800
have a seat.

416
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:02,434
jamba juice upped
their offer--

417
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:04,434
225 a square foot.

418
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:07,134
i don't know.

419
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:09,067
how's this for an idea?

420
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,067
they let you
carry the note.

421
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:13,067
you won't get hammered
on the taxes.

422
00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:15,067
well,
that's an incentive,

423
00:26:15,134 --> 00:26:17,334
but the truth is
i don't wanna sell.

424
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:19,334
you're a businessman,
are you not?

425
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:21,334
as a businessman,
i gotta tell you

426
00:26:21,401 --> 00:26:23,800
that in 10 years' time
that property's gonna

427
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:26,601
be worth twice as much
as they're offering.

428
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,501
but, you know, it's not
just the money.

429
00:26:29,568 --> 00:26:33,000
you drive around america today and
everything looks the fucking same--

430
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:36,267
old navy and bed, bath and whatever.

431
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:39,634
but the north ward,
it's the north ward.

432
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,634
plus, i got business
interests there, so...

433
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,234
something like all immigrant
groups love to gamble.

434
00:26:48,634 --> 00:26:51,367
listen, why don't...

435
00:26:51,434 --> 00:26:53,367
me and you go get
some dinner?

436
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:55,067
i have a boyfriend.

437
00:26:55,134 --> 00:26:56,967
i'm engaged.

438
00:26:57,034 --> 00:27:00,000
i have a wife.
i'm married.

439
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:02,334
it's... you know,
we're talking business.

440
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:05,367
you just said you don't wanna
sell. what's there to discuss?

441
00:27:05,434 --> 00:27:08,267
truth is i'm
very attracted to you.

442
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,134
maybe you read in the
papers that i got shot.

443
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:15,867
well, julianna,

444
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:20,833
that experience made
me appreciate life.

445
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,800
it's short. it could
end at any time,

446
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:25,634
and if you've got
the chance to do something

447
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,000
that might make you happy,

448
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:32,668
you should take it,

449
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:36,167
you know, like when
you left binghamton.

450
00:27:45,568 --> 00:27:48,067
you're very persuasive.

451
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:51,067
and in the past,
i might have jumped.

452
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:53,067
like i said,
i'm engaged.

453
00:27:53,134 --> 00:27:55,201
and things
are going well.

454
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:57,634
i think for once
in my life,

455
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,267
i will exercise
a little self-control.

456
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
thanks for the drink.

457
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:26,900
guy sent this over.

458
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:29,434
i saw that guy
in the field the other day.

459
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,501
when we were
practicing dummy drag,

460
00:28:31,568 --> 00:28:33,900
he spent the whole time
in the bleachers stari.

461
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:37,334
yeah?
vince, come here.

462
00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:39,167
join us.

463
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:44,767
he's a very funny guy.
great sense of humor.

464
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,534
- thanks for this.
- thanks.

465
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:48,800
my pleasure.

466
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:51,000
we were talking about
a call we had last month.

467
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:54,334
<i>- we were lucky the roof held.
- did anyone hear that yma sumac scream</i>

468
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,501
when the ceiling fan
came down? that was ron.

469
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,534
the goddamn thing
almost killed me.

470
00:28:58,601 --> 00:29:01,100
- you would have
screamed too, you cunt.

471
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:04,501
fucking nancies.
don't argue now.

472
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:08,467
you know, guys, we've got to get serious
about the state muster next month.

473
00:29:08,534 --> 00:29:11,401
last year hinsdale whipped
our butt in that ladder carry.

474
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:14,668
- what's that, a deuce?
- fat boy.

475
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:17,668
chromed out the forks.

476
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:21,234
- nice.
- you ride?

477
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,967
i always wanted a
panhead. never happened.

478
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:27,134
you should get a bike.

479
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:29,134
out here when the leaves
are changing,

480
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,334
blasting down
the daniel webster highway,

481
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:35,100
- there's nothing else like it.
- yeah.

482
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,900
i bet.

483
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:42,534
you know,
i'm glad you decided

484
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:44,900
to write your book
in our little town.

485
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:53,534
what the fuck you doing? what
are you, some kind of fag?

486
00:29:53,601 --> 00:29:55,934
- guess i made a mistake.
- you sure as fuck did.

487
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,100
listen, closet queen, you can't
handle it-- don't sent out the signals.

488
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,967
dirty fighter, huh?

489
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,934
asshole.

490
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:39,334
see that?
you didn't even notice.

491
00:30:42,568 --> 00:30:44,067
what?

492
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,067
that salami--

493
00:30:46,134 --> 00:30:48,067
40% less fat
and sodium.

494
00:30:48,134 --> 00:30:50,134
you know...

495
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:56,100
you're always
looking out for me.

496
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:58,134
- i'm very lucky to have you.
- mmm.

497
00:30:59,634 --> 00:31:02,134
and don't you
forget it.

498
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:07,634
hey, prince albert,
you know what time it is?

499
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,668
huh?

500
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,034
these late nights
are getting to be

501
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,134
a real habit with you, a.j.
don't you have to work today?

502
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:19,634
look, i gotta
talk to you guys.

503
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,700
i need new clothes.
everything i have is so old.

504
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:26,134
you got money.
you sold your drums.

505
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:28,534
and i need that money
for living expenses.

506
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:30,534
what do you think
clothes are?

507
00:31:30,601 --> 00:31:33,301
no, i mean nice clothes,
not socks and underwear.

508
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:36,100
oh, so you can go out
to the clubs with...

509
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,568
fernando.
that kid is a creep.

510
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:41,134
hernan. and he's not a
creep. he's my friend.

511
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:43,434
and i don't talk about
your friends that way.

512
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,501
when they were in school,
hernan's mother and i

513
00:31:45,568 --> 00:31:47,234
were in the faculty
lunch committee.

514
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:49,700
- hernan has a reading disability.
- fuck that.

515
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:51,634
and we're not giving you
any more money.

516
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,568
frankly, a.j.,
i am a little concerned--

517
00:31:54,634 --> 00:31:56,568
the clubs, sleeping late,

518
00:31:56,634 --> 00:31:58,668
your lack of interest
in anything productive.

519
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,668
hey, i'm interested
in productive stuff,

520
00:32:00,733 --> 00:32:02,668
just not stuff
you care about.

521
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:05,367
- i could run one of those clubs.
- what?

522
00:32:05,434 --> 00:32:07,833
look, i'm not just partying
there. i'm learning.

523
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,601
i see what works,
what doesn't.

524
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:11,367
i could have a great club,

525
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:13,201
and really successful.

526
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:15,267
if you guys care so much
about my future,

527
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:16,800
then why don't you
stake me?

528
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:19,067
in a club?
get the hell out of here.

529
00:32:19,134 --> 00:32:21,634
you pick up the garbage in
a lot of clubs in new york.

530
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,334
you know people. you could
help me. it's not like you can't

531
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,800
afford to set me up. you have
all the money in the world.

532
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:29,267
this is ridiculous.
manage a club, a.j.?

533
00:32:29,334 --> 00:32:31,434
you've never even been
a busboy.

534
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:33,467
if you wanna get back
into event planning,

535
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,167
you should think about the
culinary institute in poughkeepsie.

536
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:39,067
culinary institute? why do you
keep talking about event planning?

537
00:32:39,134 --> 00:32:40,733
i don't even know
what that is.

538
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,900
if you're serious,
i'll tell you what i'll do.

539
00:32:42,967 --> 00:32:46,467
i'll get you a job at beansie's and you
can learn the business from the ground up.

540
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:48,201
that's a fucking pizza parlor,
not a club.

541
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:49,833
it's the service
industry!

542
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,668
why are we even
having this discussion?

543
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:53,800
you're going back to
college next semester.

544
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:55,733
see? this is
just what i mean.

545
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,201
you guys never give me any
support in anything i wanna do.

546
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,201
<i>- a.j.!
- oh!</i>

547
00:33:00,267 --> 00:33:02,534
<i>god damn him.</i>

548
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:05,334
this is fucking
demoralizing.

549
00:33:10,934 --> 00:33:14,167
maybe we should get him a club,
give him some responsibility.

550
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:16,067
maybe he'll rise
to the occasion.

551
00:33:16,134 --> 00:33:19,334
are you insane? he's not
even legal drinking age.

552
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:21,367
well, yeah yeah.

553
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,467
it's like a... bad smell
in the house.

554
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,833
it's always
hanging there.

555
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,100
more than that, it's no
good for me and carmela.

556
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,367
'cause arguing with a.j. is no kind
of aphrodisiac, i'll tell you that.

557
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:47,201
just when i was
beginning to feel

558
00:33:47,267 --> 00:33:50,401
physically good again,
like my old self.

559
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:53,733
- good. i see.
- but honestly, no one could blame a man

560
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,900
for seeking an extracurricular
outlet in a situation like this.

561
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:01,867
don't give me that look.

562
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:04,100
you're always telling me
that i'm projecting.

563
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,767
you're projecting.

564
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:09,601
so you're not seeking
an extracurricular outlet?

565
00:34:09,668 --> 00:34:12,467
no. i was just
being theoretical.

566
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,700
what carmela did for me
when i was hurt,

567
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:19,467
the way
she took care of me,

568
00:34:19,534 --> 00:34:22,700
nursed me back to health-- you
think i wanna fucking betray that?

569
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:25,034
is it possible
on some level

570
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,601
you blame her
for a.j.'s problems?

571
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,067
look, i don't know.

572
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:34,000
no. carmela's
a good mother.

573
00:34:36,467 --> 00:34:38,434
she did her best.

574
00:34:40,867 --> 00:34:43,034
look, could you
just give me

575
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,067
some practical advice

576
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:47,067
for once?

577
00:34:47,134 --> 00:34:49,800
tell me what the fuck
to do about my son?

578
00:34:49,867 --> 00:34:51,800
well...

579
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:53,833
i think it's
entirely appropriate

580
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,833
for you and carmela
to tell a.j.

581
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,668
you have certain
expectations of him,

582
00:34:58,733 --> 00:35:03,134
particularly since he's
living in your home.

583
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,167
<i>the most
important thing is</i>

584
00:35:05,234 --> 00:35:07,601
that you and carmela
are in agreement

585
00:35:07,668 --> 00:35:09,601
on the issues,

586
00:35:09,668 --> 00:35:11,601
that you don't
undercut each other

587
00:35:11,668 --> 00:35:14,201
or act at cross purposes.

588
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,067
here.
so you can buy a suit

589
00:35:22,134 --> 00:35:24,568
to look nice for job
or college interviews.

590
00:35:24,634 --> 00:35:26,767
this is not for fun.
this is not to be used

591
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,267
for any kind
of personal entertainment.

592
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,967
thanks.

593
00:36:21,401 --> 00:36:23,867
<i>hi.</i>

594
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:27,000
hey, mr. soprano.
what's going on?

595
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:29,167
welcome back.

596
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:32,668
hey, what's up?
meet my friends.

597
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:35,467
this is farhad and...

598
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:38,267
- daryl. what's up?
- ...daryl; a.j. soprano.

599
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:41,134
you know
tommy filippo?

600
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:42,900
- providence?
- no, i don't think so.

601
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,434
good friend of mine.
he's connected.

602
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:47,034
farhad and daryl are starting
a line of sports drinks.

603
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,434
- cool. - big thing now.
not just carbs-- protein.

604
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:52,434
when you exercise,
you drink four to one

605
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,534
carbohydrate
to protein solution--

606
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:56,800
decrease muscle damage,
increase endurance.

607
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:59,601
- yeah, that makes sense.
- they're looking for investors.

608
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:02,434
- maybe we can get you a prospectus, eh?
- absolutely.

609
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:05,234
for your dad. you can
ask him to look at it.

610
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,733
do you ever go to lotus?
good crowd on wednesdays.

611
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,700
- i was there twice. - i was
there last week-- unbelievable.

612
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:19,434
hey, wake me up
tomorrow, okay? 10:00?

613
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:24,833
we were just up
in bradford.

614
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,733
there's a beautiful
long truss bridge there.

615
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,167
mmm. right.

616
00:37:29,234 --> 00:37:31,401
if you're interested
in covered bridges,

617
00:37:31,467 --> 00:37:33,234
<i>you need to get over
to swanzey.</i>

618
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:35,467
<i>they have four marvelous
bridges there,</i>

619
00:37:35,534 --> 00:37:37,467
<i>including a queen post.</i>

620
00:37:37,534 --> 00:37:40,634
<i>honey, we could go tomorrow.</i>

621
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:43,034
<i>you know where else you
should go is shaker village.</i>

622
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,867
<i>- you can't beat those
shaker brooms.</i>

623
00:37:45,934 --> 00:37:48,000
<i>oh, i love old brooms!</i>

624
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:58,000
a.j.!

625
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,467
i woke you up two hours
ago like you asked me.

626
00:38:00,534 --> 00:38:02,534
now get up.

627
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,067
- ouch.
- carl, are you all right?

628
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:15,733
it is 4:00
in the afternoon.

629
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,367
you are not even dressed!

630
00:38:17,434 --> 00:38:19,833
i got the impression you had
something important to do.

631
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:46,900
- there you go, corrado.
- how come i don't get no mail?

632
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:48,934
maybe you need
to write some letters,

633
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,201
start a correspondence.

634
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:54,467
lying cocksucker!

635
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:56,800
they throw my mail out.

636
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:04,067
<i>your uncle is having
dinner, but you can see him now.</i>

637
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:06,134
<i>warren will take you in.</i>

638
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:11,067
this way.

639
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:17,668
wait for me, please.

640
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,668
he's over here.

641
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:42,134
- corrado, you have a visitor.
- what?

642
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:46,733
anthony!
my nephew.

643
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:50,067
take me home.
i wanna go home.

644
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:53,833
<i>knife!</i>

645
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,800
that's not my knife.

646
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:58,668
hey! hey hey hey!

647
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:01,434
- let go of me! let go of me!
- take it easy.

648
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:03,800
- he shot my dad!
- relax.

649
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:05,867
- he shot my dad!
- relax. take it easy.

650
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,934
uh, anthony soprano.

651
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,434
yeah. i just talked
to assemblyman zellman.

652
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,501
get him out of here.

653
00:40:45,534 --> 00:40:47,534
my stomach hurts.

654
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:53,700
you stupid fucking moron. you realize
what could have happened to you

655
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:55,934
if we didn't have
connections?!

656
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,034
some cop goes by the book
and they charge you

657
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,634
with attempted murder!
you hear me?

658
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:03,134
attempted murder!
then what? then what?

659
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:06,668
he shot you! you were just gonna
let him fucking get away with it?

660
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:09,234
i told you that's
my business, not yours!

661
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,634
and what did you do?
nothing!

662
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,401
zero!
a big fucking jerk-off!

663
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:16,434
- fuck you!
- i oughta break your fucking neck!

664
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:26,100
stop cryin'.
stop cryin'!

665
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:36,301
i guess your heart was
in the right place, a.j.

666
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,967
but it's wrong.
come on.

667
00:41:41,034 --> 00:41:44,833
- what?!
- it's not in your nature.

668
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,167
you don't know me. and you
don't know anything about me.

669
00:41:48,234 --> 00:41:51,668
you're a nice guy and that's a
good thing, for christ's sakes.

670
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:55,134
- bullshit!
- i mean it.

671
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:58,700
you're a good guy.
i'm very grateful.

672
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:00,700
well, you're a fucking
hypocrite,

673
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,900
because every time
we watch "godfather"

674
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:05,867
when michael corleone shoots
those guys at the restaurant,

675
00:42:05,934 --> 00:42:07,900
those assholes
who tried to kill his dad,

676
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:10,367
you sit there with your
fucking bowl of ice cream

677
00:42:10,434 --> 00:42:12,867
and you say it's your
favorite scene of all time!

678
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,733
jesus christ, a.j...

679
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,201
you make me wanna cry.

680
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:28,301
it's a movie.

681
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:34,167
you gotta grow up.

682
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:37,700
you're not a kid anymore.

683
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:39,668

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,833

685
00:43:07,267 --> 00:43:10,201
first of all, your mother
does not find out about this.

686
00:43:30,668 --> 00:43:32,134

687
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:35,034
i know you don't wanna sell,
but i thought you should know--

688
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,234
jamba juice upped their offer
to 275 a square foot.

689
00:43:38,301 --> 00:43:40,134

00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,134

691
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:44,800
<i>plus they'll let you
carry the note at 7.5%.</i>

692
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:47,234

695
00:44:03,301 --> 00:44:05,301

696
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:08,100

00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:19,668

00:44:36,601 --> 00:44:39,934

00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,634
coffee?

704
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,700
sometimes you tell
a lie so long...

705
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:09,534
you don't know
when to stop.

706
00:45:13,267 --> 00:45:15,334
you don't know
when it's safe.

707
00:45:17,767 --> 00:45:19,733
i hear you.

708
00:45:30,134 --> 00:45:32,067

711
00:45:39,034 --> 00:45:41,201
ooh, the canali.

712
00:45:41,267 --> 00:45:43,201
where are you going?

713
00:45:43,267 --> 00:45:46,034
i've got a...
real estate thing.

714
00:45:48,534 --> 00:45:50,534
my handsome man.

715
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,967
i can't get used
to this torque.

716
00:46:18,034 --> 00:46:20,067
what?

717
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,601
so my landlord, this
fucking armenian asshole,

718
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,767
won't give me my deposit
back. seven grand!

719
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:50,134
my dad's, like,
super pissed!

720
00:46:50,201 --> 00:46:52,668
anyway, i was thinking maybe
you could talk to your dad

721
00:46:52,733 --> 00:46:55,067
who could send someone to
lean on this prick a little

722
00:46:55,134 --> 00:46:57,467
and get him to give me
my money back.

723
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:01,401
soprano's the man!

724
00:47:22,067 --> 00:47:24,000
hey, are you okay?

725
00:47:24,067 --> 00:47:26,434
you want some...?

726
00:47:26,501 --> 00:47:28,467
no.

727
00:47:31,134 --> 00:47:33,067
hi.

728
00:47:33,134 --> 00:47:35,534
champagne?

729
00:47:35,601 --> 00:47:38,934
- we're celebrating, aren't we?
- i guess.

730
00:47:40,434 --> 00:47:43,867
in the trade, this is called
"the ben franklin close"--

731
00:47:43,934 --> 00:47:47,100
placing the pen on the line
you want someone to sign.

732
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:49,301
theoretically, it makes it
harder for them

733
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,367
to have second thoughts.

734
00:47:52,733 --> 00:47:55,401
i'll have to show you
my collection sometime--

735
00:47:55,467 --> 00:47:58,367
"the franklin mint."

736
00:47:58,434 --> 00:48:00,534
- you're not serious.
- what do you mean?

737
00:48:00,601 --> 00:48:02,534
okay, the contract.

00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,401

754
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:48,201

755
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:49,934

me to call an ambulance?

763
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:53,434
my heart,
it's beating so fast.

764
00:50:53,501 --> 00:50:56,000
did you take anything--
cocaine, amphetamines?

765
00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:57,334
no.

766
00:50:57,401 --> 00:51:00,000

ever happened to you before?

767
00:51:01,067 --> 00:51:03,568

of panic attacks?

768
00:51:13,434 --> 00:51:16,201
