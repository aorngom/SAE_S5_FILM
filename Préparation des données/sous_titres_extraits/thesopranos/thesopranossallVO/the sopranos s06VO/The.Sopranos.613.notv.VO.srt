1
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,800
<i>He's gonna win
another 50, 60k.</i></i>

2
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,800
<i>All right, let's not
go backwards, huh ?</i></i>

3
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,100
These people you run into wanna
be boss, huh ? They should know.

4
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,900
I told you. You don't listen, you nut.

5
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,800
You want a coffee ?

6
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,900
I don't know...

7
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,100
<i>FBI, get down !</i></i>

8
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,200
<i>FBI, down !</i></i>

9
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,300
What is that ?

10
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,700
<i>What ?</i></i>

11
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,200
Is this it ?

12
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,900
- What's going on ?
- Go back to sleep.

13
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,600
Anthony Soprano, detective
gaudioso, essex county.

14
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,000
- I have a warrant for your arrest.
- For what ?

15
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,400
- Are you Anthony Soprano ?
- What, did you bring the whole county with you ?

16
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,900
We don't take any chances when
it concerns an illegal firearm

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,700
Containing hollow-Point
ammunition.

18
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,100
What ?

19
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,800
Where's the FBI ?

20
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,100
Can I see a warrant ?
We have the right.

21
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
<i>Oh, thank God.</i></i>

22
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,200
Will you tell them he's
got a medical condition ?

23
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,800
This is his family doctor
right here. Ask him.

24
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,100
Hello, Janice.

25
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,800
Did you talk to Tony about ming
up to the lake for his birthday ?

26
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,500
Tony was arrested
this morning.

27
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
- For what ?
- Weapons charge.

28
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,100
They're booking him in north caldwell
before they take him to newark.

29
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,400
<i>- I'm dropping off his clothes right now.
- It's a gun, no big deal.</i></i>

30
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,100
Hollow-Point ammunition,
they said.

31
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,800
Yeah, well,
he'll still make bail.

32
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
You know he's not wild
about the drive, Janice.

33
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
I really think it's
not the time right now.

34
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, let him know
we're with him.

35
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,000
All right.

36
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,800
If you have hollow-Point bullets
in anything, take 'em out today.

37
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,100
Oh, God damn it, AJ,
there is tomato sauce

38
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,600
All over these pants.

39
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,800
AJ, I asked
for the brown suit

40
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,600
From the
dry-Cleaning bag.

41
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,400
The light didn't go on
in your closet.

42
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,500
Stop it,ill you please ?

43
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,500
That show of force,

44
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,400
Was that all about
humiliating dad ?

45
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,400
Your honor, the police
pulled over some kid

46
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,400
And found a baggie
with cocaine residue.

47
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,800
They also found
a gun loaded

48
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,200
With hollow-Point bullets
on the floor.

49
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,400
<i>Now in order
to beat the rap,</i></i>

50
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,900
<i>This 16-Year-Old punk</i></i>

51
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,700
<i>Claims he saw my client</i></i>

52
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,900
Drop that weapon. And
mind you, not yesterday,

53
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,000
But over two years ago,

54
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,200
Using it in the meantime
to shoot at cans

55
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,300
<i>And impress his friends.</i></i>

56
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,700
I gotta tell you, Phil,
you look fantastic.

57
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,000
- As in science fiction ?
- No. What ? Come on.

58
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,700
Fucking empty compliments. I had
major fucking coronary disease.

59
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,000
- He's not shitting you, Phil.
- I broke my fucking gazz in Florida

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,300
On that goddamn recumbent
bike, I'll tell you that.

61
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,000
Would I shit you ?
You're my favorite turd.

62
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,600
Fucking kid.

63
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,400
Why don't you get
a real bike,

64
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,600
Have some beach pussy
to look at

65
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,900
While you're
working the heart ?

66
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,700
Go over the handlebars, have some
fucking head trauma ? That's all I need.

67
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,300
I'm 66 years old.

68
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,200
Anyway, Phil,
welcome home.

69
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,600
Thanks.

70
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,200
Don't listen to me.

71
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,900
I'm a cranky fuck lately.

72
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,500
- Lately ?
- Ooh !

73
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Why don't you get
a bike, you fat fuck ?

74
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,700
Ho...

75
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,100
- how are you, doc ?
- Let me get a drink. I'll be right back.

76
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,800
All right.

77
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,300
Glad you're back, Phil.
This fucking guy.

78
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,400
How you doing ?

79
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,900
I'm here to enjoy
my grandchildren,

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,200
My home.

81
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,800
Did you hear the news ?
Pork chop out in Jersey

82
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,900
Got pinched on
a weapon charge.

83
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,100
Drops a gat in a field somewhere
three fucking years ago.

84
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,000
- What the fuck ?
- Jersey. Fucking farmers, I don't know.

85
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,800
Yeah, he was probably going
down on some sheep or some shit.

86
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,300
Gun violence is a blight
on essex county,

87
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,800
And Mr. Soprano
will be prosecuted

88
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,000
To the fullest extent
of the law...

89
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,700
you know what
that says, htor ?

90
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,500
That's your mommy's
name... Blanca.

91
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,800
<i>Blanca blanca blanca.</i></i>

92
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,400
<i>That's mommy's name.</i></i>

93
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,000
<i>AJ, can you
turn that off, please ?</i></i>

94
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,300
Tony.

95
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,500
Take the yellow ribbons down,
everybody. Our boy's come home.

96
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,700
- Dad.
- Hey. I'm fine.

97
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,000
They let him
out already ?

98
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,600
What she means is, in our neighborhood
people don't get out right away.

99
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
- Hello.
- Where's Christopher ?

100
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,100
I don't know.
I thought he was here.

101
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,000
Hold on.
It's Bobby.

102
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,600
<i>- Yeah.
- You want me to come down ?</i></i>

103
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,900
No, nothing a hot shower
won't fix.

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,500
Carm told jan you were on
the fence about the weekend.

105
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,400
I don't know.
Sit around, chew the fat.

106
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,000
We got the meeting
with the canadians.

107
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,800
Ton', with these hassles, you
should make it up our way here.

108
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,400
You know, maybe that's
not such a bad idea.

109
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,700
Mr. Federal attorney.

110
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,700
- What can I do for you ?
- You had to have your cheap headline, huh ?

111
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,300
Can you really not be aware
we've been building a Rico case

112
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,300
Against Tony Soprano
for five fucking years ?

113
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,500
Then you blow this
popcorn fart.

114
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,600
Are you gonna relax ?

115
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
It's just all this
little stuff,

116
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,800
Like my phone has
one little bar up here.

117
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,900
I mean, what if the broker's
trying to contact me ?

118
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,400
Caravan for my house is on
Tuesday, and the gas is still off.

119
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,300
Mine works.

120
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,700
- Hello.
- Essex county dropped the charges.

121
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,100
I told you it was
a piece-Of-Shit case.

122
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
<i>Two years old,
no decent prints.</i></i>

123
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,700
<i>Santa Claus could have
dropped that gun in the snow.</i></i>

124
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,600
They dropped the charges.
Well, I'd say I owe you one,

125
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,900
But I'm sure
it's more than one.

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Neil, thanks again.

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,300
Thank God. I really didn't want
it hanging over your birthday.

128
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,800
Can we forget already
that it's my birthday ?

129
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,600
You say that and then you get
upset if nobody makes a fuss.

130
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,900
- Hi.
- There you are.

131
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,700
I was starting
to get worried.

132
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,100
Traffic was horrible.

133
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,500
- I've had to pee since glen falls.
- Well, go.

134
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Hey, sis.

135
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,000
"National lampoon's
vacation."

136
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
How you doing ?

137
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,600
How are you ?

138
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,100
You know, I gotta
admit it... Every time,

139
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,400
Once you're up here,

140
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,200
It's pretty great.

141
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,400
Aren't you adorable too

142
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,800
With your matching dress
just like mommy's ?

143
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,200
- Hi, Mercedes.
- Hello.

144
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,000
It's your favorite uncle.

145
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,200
There she is.
It's that little girl,

146
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,200
But I forget her name.

147
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,600
- Gladys ?
- Nica.

148
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,500
- No, murgatroyd.
- Nica.

149
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,000
Uh-Oh.

150
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,700
Daddy.

151
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,200
- Oh, daddy's girl.
- Daddy's little girl.

152
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,100
- Who's hungry ?
- You know, a water would be perfect.

153
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,900
- Pellegrino ?
- Sure.

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,600
He's gonna pass.
He's stuffed.

155
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,200
- Shoprite sparkling ?
- Sure.

156
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,100
If frank sinatra were coming
here to celebrate his birthday,

157
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,700
Would you leave the lawn
like that ? Looks like shit.

158
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
He has enough lawn
maintenance at the new house

159
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,500
Since somebody let
the gardener go.

160
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,900
Oh, the house
wasn't enough.

161
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,700
I'm joking.

162
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,500
You know how
grateful we are.

163
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,800
Beer, Ton' ?

164
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,100
Absolutely.

165
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Madonn'.

166
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,900
800 rounds per.

167
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,300
He chromed out
the inner carrier.

168
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,600
And what I like, it's got
the panther fluted barrel.

169
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,100
Is this how
you bagged that deer ?

170
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,300
I wouldn't use a firearm
like this on a deer.

171
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,900
It's unsportsmanlike.

172
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,800
Oh, like the poor prick's
got a chance against a 30.06.

173
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
Actually,
last two seasons,

174
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,100
I've been using a bow
and arrow exclusively.

175
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,800
Get the fuck out
of here.

176
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,100
Seriously, it levels
the playing field.

177
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,800
The ar-10, that's my
birthday present to you.

178
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,300
Thanks, Bobby.

179
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't say shit
to Carmela.

180
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,600
Me and Tony almost got
a summer place--

181
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,000
Down the Shore,
remember, Tony ?

182
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,600
Any more
stuffed mushrooms ?

183
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,700
My pop bought this place
'cause it was close to canada.

184
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,200
He had ties in montreal.
You know, Ton'.

185
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,800
His father, my grandpop,
come into the country

186
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,700
Originally through
montreal, illegally.

187
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,000
No kidding ? He wasn't Ellis
island, your grandfather ?

188
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,800
Nah, got mixed up in some
shenanigans on the other side,

189
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,100
Anti-Government
or something.

190
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,300
Had a police record.

191
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,800
They oughta build
a wall now, though.

192
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,000
- I'm telling you.
- Amen.

193
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,600
Mommy !

194
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,700
When are
the kids back ?

195
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,500
Sophia the 7th and robert
the end of the month.

196
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,200
That's nice.

197
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
I'm very lucky
to be back

198
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,300
With my family
after all these years.

199
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,200
Look at you and me,
Tony.

200
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,300
Who would have thought we'd have
the kind of relationship we have now ?

201
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,600
The credit goes
to you.

202
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,000
You really changed.

203
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,200
So I had to change ?

204
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,000
It's a compliment.

205
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,600
You were fine.

206
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,200
You're different

207
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,100
Since that stuff
last year--

208
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,900
<i>The shooting.</i></i>

209
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,300
- I'm sure Carm would agree.
- I would.

210
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,900
Oh, look,
the fish are jumping.

211
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,700
I'm different how ?
How am I different ?

212
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
Story you heard.

213
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,600
- The pool.
- Oh my God, please.

214
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,200
- What ?
- You don't wanna know.

215
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,100
Pradeep,
our pharmacist,

216
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,900
Was at a pool party.

217
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,100
All the kids were playing
in the water.

218
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,500
The adults were all around
and having drinks, barbecuing.

219
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,600
Somehow even with
all these people around,

220
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,200
This three-Year-Old child
managed to fall into the pool.

221
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,000
Nobody even noticed till finally
they found him floating face down

222
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
In the water.

223
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,600
Brain dead.

224
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,400
Poor kid's in one of those
padded wheelchairs now.

225
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,600
Oh.

226
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,300
I can't get that story
out of my mind.

227
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't know why.

228
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Happy birthday.

229
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,700
It's supposed
to rain down there,

230
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,600
So make sure that all the
cellar windows are closed.

231
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,800
<i>- Okay.
- And make sure you check the one by dad's wine rack.</i></i>

232
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,500
- Okay.
- Easy, big fella.

233
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,600
- That jacuzzi's bitchin'.
- Who is that ?

234
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,500
That's fran the waitress.
We're really busy down here.

235
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,800
- You're at work ?
- Yes, I'm at the pizzeria.

236
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,400
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

237
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Bye.

238
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,600
The jacuzzi
and the tub's fantastic.

239
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,400
There's everybody.

240
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,000
Don't let us forget
to wash the sheets, okay ?

241
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,600
Yeah, ha ha !

242
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Anthony reboam Soprano.

243
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,100
What's up ?

244
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,500
Tony seem to hit the hooch
a little at lunch today ?

245
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,300
I think he's feeling
his age.

246
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,100
What do you think
it's like for me ?

247
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,000
When we were kids,

248
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,200
He'd do whatever I said.

249
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,900
He ate one of tippy's milk-Bones
because I told him it was a cookie.

250
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,800
My therapist sandy,

251
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,700
She said my ma
was a splitter.

252
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,700
She'd pit us three
against each other--

253
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,700
To toughen us up,
I guess.

254
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,900
I couldn't help hearing
you with AJ.

255
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,600
God, you gotta walk on eggshells
with these kids today, huh ?

256
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,800
We're almost through
that phase, thank God.

257
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
You're good with them.

258
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,000
Really ? I wish
he'd go back to college.

259
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,700
He sleeps most nights
at blanca's.

260
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,600
Speaking of kids and ma,

261
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Sandy said something
interesting--

262
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,700
That when we were babies,

263
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,900
Everything was fine,

264
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,300
But ma couldn't stand that
as her babies got older,

265
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,100
They separated from her.

266
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,300
When they started
to talk and express ideas,

267
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,600
That's when
the trouble started.

268
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,200
It wasn't that
she didn't love us.

269
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Mmm-Mmm !

270
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
<i>You've been a solid
performer for some time now.</i></i>

271
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,100
Plus, you're my
brother-In-Law.

272
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,300
You get older,
you think about things.

273
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,300
You're a young man.
We both are.

274
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,100
- World's still in front of us.
- Boss.

275
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
My estimate historically,

276
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,700
80% of the time it ends up
in the can like Johnny Sack

277
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,600
Or on the embalming table
at cozarelli's.

278
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,300
Don't even say it.

279
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,000
No risk, no reward.

280
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,900
I mean, yeah, our line
of work, it's always out there.

281
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,800
You probably don't even hear
it when it happens, right ?

282
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Ask your friend
in there on the wall.

283
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,900
Listen to us.
Morbid fucks.

284
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,100
Come to think of it, you never popped
your cherry in that regard, right ?

285
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,600
No.

286
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,200
Yet your old man was
the fucking Terminator.

287
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,300
I come close.

288
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,200
I done other shit,
but no.

289
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,800
A salut'.

290
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,000
It's a big fat pain
in the balls.

291
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,200
Especially now
with DNA evidence.

292
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,700
My pop never
wanted it for me.

293
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,800
He said there were times
with all the worry

294
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,800
That he wished he could have
stayed in the shop full-Time,

295
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,400
Just cut hair.

296
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,300
To be honest, I'd rather he
fucking shot me than cut my hair.

297
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,400
There's somebody I've been
bringing along to insulate myself

298
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,900
From the stuff that
could bring down a boss,

299
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,600
And take care of Carmela
too, in case...

300
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,900
God forbid.

301
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,700
Now maybe

302
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,500
Between me
and this person...

303
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,400
there's diverging agendas.

304
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,100
- Sorry to hear it.
- It happens.

305
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,400
Thing is, the newark
facilities manager,

306
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,800
He's gonna fix it so we do
all the window replacements

307
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,900
In the projects.

308
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,500
I was thinking maybe
you should work that.

309
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,200
I'm honored just
to be considered.

310
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,300
Then we'll see what happens
after that, long-Term.

311
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,700
- Time for presents.
- And grappa.

312
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,100
I told you people I didn't
want any presents, just...

313
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,900
just a few kind words.

314
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,300
That was my father's line
every year.

315
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,300
I get the joke,
believe me.

316
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,800
"Soprano home movies."

317
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,400
I had all the super 8s from
when we were kids transferred.

318
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,200
Oh, cool.

319
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,900
It's really
very thoughtful.

320
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,300
Thank you.

321
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,600
- Uh-Oh.
- Oh, look at these.

322
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,800
Oh, look at this.

323
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,900
Tailor-Mades, wow !

324
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,500
You're not just a funny,
smart, lovable,

325
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,400
Good-Looking guy.

326
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,400
<i>- You're mine."
- Aww.</i></i>

327
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,400
- Thank you, baby.
- Happy birthday.

328
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,700
Cent' ann', Anthony.

329
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,500
Oh, wait wait.

330
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,300
To have my health,

331
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,800
To be in this
beautiful spot

332
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,800
With people
that I love--

333
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,300
- I couldn't ask for more.
- Salut'.

334
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,200
Six.

335
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,200
Community chest.

336
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,100
"Pay hospital $100."
Fuck me.

337
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,600
What are you doing ?
It goes in the bank.

338
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,000
- We play the free parking rule.
- What free parking rule ?

339
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,700
Money from community chest and
chance goes into the middle.

340
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,900
Whoever lands on free
parking ge the money.

341
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,500
You show me that
in the rules.

342
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,400
Technically it isn't in the rules,
but a lot of people play it that way.

343
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
It adds a whole new level
of excitement to the game.

344
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,500
I don't agree with that.

345
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,400
When we were growing up in our
house, this is how we played.

346
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,400
You know, the parker brothers
took time to think this all out.

347
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
I think we should
respect that.

348
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,300
Fuck the parker brothers.
Just play the game.

349
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,800
Out of grappa.
How about some rémy ?

350
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,800
- 9, 10, 11...
- Yay !

351
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,500
- Fuck.
- Marvin gardens

352
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,000
With two houses--

353
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
360 simoleons.

354
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,000
Don't throw the money
at me. Hand it to me.

355
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,700
I saw that.

356
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,700
- Saw what ?
- You just kyped $500 from the bank.

357
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,200
God damn it, Tony !

358
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,100
I beg your pardon,
my sweet little potato.

359
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,700
You asshole.

360
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,700
- Free parking, baby.
- This is bullshit.

361
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,600
You take a game of skill and
you make it just about luck.

362
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,600
Are you listening
to this fucking crybaby ?

363
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,700
How about I make up
my own fucking rules ?

364
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,200
How about every time I land
on one of my properties,

365
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
I get $100.
How about that ?

366
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,500
How about that ?
How about that ?

367
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,400
Whose turn is it,
my turn ?

368
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,600
<i>It was mine.
Okay.</i></i>

369
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,400
Here's $150.

370
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,800
I want to put a house
on ventnor.

371
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,500
Daddy !

372
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,300
She wants to say
good night again.

373
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,500
- Aww.
- You gotta go to bed, baby.

374
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,800
Come here, my sweetie.

375
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,000
Yes, so if you go
to bed,

376
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,500
You know what ?

377
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,500
Mommy will give you
a willy wonka laffy taffy.

378
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,100
<i>- Laffy taffy !
- Jan, we talked about this.</i></i>

379
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,900
You tell me the difference
between bribery

380
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,200
And positive reinforcement.

381
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,100
That looked like
a bribe to me.

382
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,000
You know what, uncle Tony ?
Butt the fuck out.

383
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,700
In front of the baby.

384
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,300
They're in the kitchen.
Night-Night.

385
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,200
I could tape you. Send
it to "parents magazine."

386
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,200
What's that supposed
to mean ?

387
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,400
When we were kids,
remember ?

388
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
You tape-Recorded me
and barb fighting.

389
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,700
You blackmailed us
for over a fucking month.

390
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,500
- I did no such thing.
- Oh ! Yeah, you did.

391
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,800
- You fed him a milk-Bone.
- You what ?

392
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,800
You want to swap
family stories, Ton' ?

393
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,100
How about the time
that mom and dad

394
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,100
Were coming back
from the copa ?

395
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,600
That's enough, Janice.

396
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,300
And ma's hair...

397
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,200
that never even happened. And anyway,
it's not for public consumption.

398
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,400
- Oh, my God, what ?
- They're driving back from Manhattan

399
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,400
With uncle jun
and his goomar.

400
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,400
Oh, what was
her name, Tony ?

401
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,500
- Your ass. 
- That's how we
heard the story... Through her.

402
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,500
Rose marie.
Anyway,

403
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,200
My father's driving,

404
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,500
And she's ragging on his ass.
You know how she'd get.

405
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,100
He'd been drinking,
I guess.

406
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,200
- And he takes out his gun.
- Oh my God.

407
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,100
- Boom !
- Holy shit.

408
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,500
Fucking blew it

409
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,600
Right through
her beehive hairdo.

410
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,100
I can't believe you
never told me that story.

411
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Yeah,
what's the big deal ?

412
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,000
'Cause it makes us look like
a fucking dysfunctional family.

413
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,200
- Jesus Christ !
- My turn.

414
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,600
And don't you ever tell the kids
that about their grandfather.

415
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,400
Of course not.

416
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,000
So did you guys look at her
hair ? Was there powder burns ?

417
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,900
She had it bobbed
the next day.

418
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,000
- Play the game.
- Okay okay.

419
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,800
Doubles.

420
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,600
Ah, one-Two-Three,
four-Five-Six...

421
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,100
boardwalk--
I own it.

422
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,600
You blew guys
under it.

423
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,100
<i>I roll again.</i></i>

424
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,400
Okay.

425
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,300
"Second prize in
a beauty contest.

426
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,500
Collect $10."

427
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,100
Go ahead !

428
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,700
Make your stupid joke.

429
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,700
I got nothing to say.

430
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,100
Think I'll buy
a railroad.

431
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,900
A german shepherd's shaved
asshole won first prize.

432
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,300
Ho... You're talking
about my wife.

433
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,700
- You married her.
- This is my home.

434
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,200
No more talking
like that.

435
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,700
- It's okay, Bobby.
- Stay outta this.

436
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,900
You sopranos--

437
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,600
You go too far.

438
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,900
All right. You know,
jan, he's right.

439
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,200
I'm sorry.

440
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,300
I crossed the line.

441
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,900
<i>- Apologize.
It won't happen again.</i></i>

442
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,200
My turn--
Oh fuck, income tax.

443
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,100
...with his schlong
in jan's mouth...

444
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,200
- oh, Tony !
- Bobby !

445
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,600
No, stop !

446
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,300
What are you doing ?

447
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,900
Stop that now !

448
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,400
You fuck !

449
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,800
<i>Tony !</i></i>

450
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,600
Tony !
Stop it !

451
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,700
Ow !

452
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Bobby !

453
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,300
What the fuck are you doing ? Stop !

454
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,400
Stop !

455
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,000
<i>Bobby !</i></i>

456
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,100
<i>Mommy !</i></i>

457
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,000
<i>- Mommy !
- What do we pay you for ? Put her to bed.</i></i>

458
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,000
<i>Bobby !</i></i>

459
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,900
Tony... Tony,
are you all right ?

460
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,700
Oh, Jesus.

461
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,900
Come on... Oh.

462
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,400
<i>Bobby... Stop.</i></i>

463
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,200
Stop, you are
in no condition.

464
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,600
You'll kill
yourself !

465
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,500
Fuck !

466
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,700
I'm okay.

467
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,400
Oh, my shoulder
is killing me.

468
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,100
Jesus fucking Christ,
Tony.

469
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Is he all right ?

470
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,500
<i>Hold it, everybody.</i></i>

471
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,500
Look, Ton',
I'm really sorry.

472
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,900
Bobby,
just shut up.

473
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,500
Let's all just
go to bed.

474
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,100
I'll go get
some ice.

475
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,400
What the fuck were
you thinking ?

476
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,600
You're my wife.
He insulted you.

477
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,700
I'm a big girl.
I can take care of myself.

478
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,300
Oh, God, he is
head of the family.

479
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,700
Do you think he's just gonna wake
up tomorrow and forget about this ?

480
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,500
What the fuck
are you doing ?

481
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,300
You beat me
fair and square.

482
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,800
Come on,
let's just...

483
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,000
well, I hope
you're proud of yourself.

484
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,200
How's your shoulder ?

485
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,400
- Great.
- Maybe we should have it looked at.

486
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,400
I'm packed.
I would like to go.

487
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,400
You were right. You told me
to ease up on the drinking.

488
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,500
You shoulda' insisted.

489
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,100
So now it's my fault ?

490
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,800
Go wash your face
so we can leave.

491
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,500
I hope you're hungry.
I made a frittata.

492
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,900
And ramos fizzes.

493
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,900
Well, thank you but we think
it'd be better if we left.

494
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,200
Not because of
last night ?

495
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,900
It's for the best.

496
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,000
Come on,
we're family !

497
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,900
Jesus, these
things happen.

498
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,900
I really think we'd all
be more comfortable.

499
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,200
We had a little
too much to drink,

500
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,900
But no harm done. The whole
thing's already forgotten.

501
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,600
Besides, Tony, we have that
thing later. The canucks.

502
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,000
It's a sin
to waste food.

503
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,500
Well, I don't know.

504
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,200
Here--
Hair of the dog.

505
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,500
<i>...suicide car bomber
kills two us soldiers...</i></i>

506
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,700
<i>...west of baghdad.</i></i>

507
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,800
<i>That makes five americans killed
in iraq over the past two days.</i></i>

508
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,600
<i>There are more
aqi deaths,</i></i>

509
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,500
<i>At least 29 bodies found
scattered around baghdad today...</i></i>

510
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,700
fucking look at him
out there.

511
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,700
What ?

512
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,700
I've seen that
sitting in the chair thing.

513
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,300
Come on.
Peop sit in chairs.

514
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,000
<i>The couple from
verona never came back</i></i>

515
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,100
To take a second look
at the house.

516
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,100
Meadow's staying in
this weekend to study.

517
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,100
Pediatricians aren't
the highest-Paid doctors--

518
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,600
That's radiologists.

519
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:46,300
But still, what
a wonderful thing to be.

520
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,400
That fucking throw rug
hadn't been there,

521
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,000
Would've been Bobby
on his back, not me.

522
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,100
- What ?
- I wouldn't have slipped. I would have kicked his ass.

523
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,300
Jesus Christ,
do you think I care ?

524
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,800
Oh, you don't, huh ?

525
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,400
You were there--

526
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,300
That night in the crowd in
the parking lot at pizza world,

527
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,500
When I took
dominic tedesco.

528
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,700
I didn't even know your
name, but I remember

529
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,600
Our eyes met, and you
were blown away.

530
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,900
I was in fucking
high school.

531
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,100
I'm supposed to be turned on by
you beating up your brother-In-Law

532
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,900
At your 47th birthday ?

533
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,700
How old is Bobby ?
42, 43 ?

534
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,000
You think those four years
don't make a difference ?

535
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You had it coming.

536
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,300
You get away with murder
because you're his boss.

537
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,900
Oh, really ?

538
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,600
And how about the fact he wouldn't
be living in that fucking mansion

539
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,500
If it wasn't for me ?

540
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,700
I had to sacrifice my entire
friendship with Johnny Sack

541
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,600
To get him and Janice
that house.

542
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,600
Funny how everybody
forgets that, huh ?

543
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
They are grateful,
Tony.

544
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,800
Jesus-- !

545
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,400
You know, you and your sister,
you are emotionally blocked.

546
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,600
I'm old, Carm.

547
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,900
And my body has
suffered a trauma

548
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,700
That it will probably
never fully recover from,

549
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,500
So why don't we just
face the facts ?

550
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,500
- Yeah ?
- Hey, t, it's me.

551
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,700
Just wanted to wish you
a belated happy birthday.

552
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,500
We had a scare
last summer.

553
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,100
Guy down the road was fishing,
thought he caught a snakehead.

554
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Yuck.

555
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Thankfully, it was
only a bowfin.

556
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,300
<i>- What's a snakehead ?
- It's this horrible, ugly fish...</i></i>

557
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,000
tell you something,
Bobby.

558
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,800
We had this little tussle
a year ago,

559
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,300
Before my injury--

560
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,600
This again ?

561
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,400
Ton', I think
everyone here knows

562
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,800
You were at
a disadvantage.

563
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,600
I don't want to take
nothin' away from you,

564
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,700
But...

565
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,700
sucker punch is
a sucker punch.

566
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,200
So then it wasn't
fair and square ?

567
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,500
I mean, make up
your mind.

568
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,300
I think we both know
what's what.

569
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,500
But forget about it.
I have.

570
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,800
Come on, Bobby,
let's go.

571
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,500
Where are
you two going ?

572
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,500
Play some golf
with some people.

573
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,900
Oh, right.

574
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,700
Why don't you just hit
a few into the lake ?

575
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,600
Bobby, come on.

576
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,600
You okay ?

577
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,900
Could turn the air on.

578
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,800
I'm good.

579
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,100
Just I should have taken
a leak before we left.

580
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,100
Oh, honey,
look at you go !

581
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,200
Mercedes, you didn't tell me that
you were taking her in the lake.

582
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,500
I'm watching her,
miss Janice.

583
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,900
You're supposed
to tell me

584
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,400
Whenever you take her
in the lake.

585
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,600
It's all right.
I'm here, too.

586
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,200
I don't want nica
going in the lake

587
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,900
Without my knowing.

588
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,200
Come on, you've been
in there long enough.

589
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,500
Nica, did you hear me ?
I'm talking to you.

590
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,600
No !

591
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,100
What did you say ?

592
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,700
Nica, come over here.

593
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,700
- No.
- Don't tell me no.

594
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,300
Don't you ever
tell me no !

595
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,100
- Mad.
- You're not mad.

596
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
You have no right
to feel mad.

597
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,700
- I'll give you
something to be mad about.

598
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,300
Take her to the house,

599
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,300
And put her to bed now.

600
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,600
She's never spoken to me
like that before... Never.

601
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,400
- Probably needs that nap.
- That fucking Bobby jr,

602
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,600
He's going through his
goddamn adolescence.

603
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,100
He's nothing but
lip and attitude.

604
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,700
She's imitating.

605
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,400
She's got
that pitch-Perfect ear.

606
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm a little hyper today.

607
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,100
<i>Maybe it's these
estrogen pills.</i></i>

608
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,900
Well, if you're
as hungover as I am...

609
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,700
that was some ory
you told, though.

610
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,300
My dad and the gun ?

611
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,600
That alone was worth
the price of admission.

612
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,600
<i>Oh, he was nabolidan'
to his core, boy.</i></i>

613
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,100
Mmm.

614
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,700
I had this boyfriend once--

615
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,700
One night he hit me.

616
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,900
Boy oh boy,
I blew my lid.

617
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,300
I completely exploded.

618
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm more like my dad.

619
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,200
Than who ?

620
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,300
Tony, for example.

621
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,200
So, what are you saying ?
He's more like your mother ?

622
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,300
<i>No.</i></i>

623
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,300
Listen, he's got that
temper too.

624
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,600
In the end he went
his separate way.

625
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,200
Who ?

626
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,400
My boyfriend.

627
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
I'm not proud
of it, though.

628
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,900
Sounds like he deserved it.

629
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,500
My mother, though,

630
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,100
She could lay out in
the weeds for days, years,

631
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,400
Waiting to strike.

632
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,300
That verbal diarrhea,

633
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,600
When you got something in
that head of yours, Janice,

634
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,200
You give yourself away. What
are you saying about my husband ?

635
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,500
What... What did
I say ?

636
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,500
I don't know what goes
on in your house,

637
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:00,000
But for your information, Tony has
never raised his hand to his children.

638
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,700
Nothing goes on
in my house.

639
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,600
- Or to me.
- Fine.

640
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,100
But you know what,
I take that back.

641
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,100
Once he slapped AJ,
and he felt horrible about it--

642
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,400
For days.

643
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,700
Bobby took advanta of him
last night

644
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,400
When Tony had had
too much to drink.

645
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,300
There is no excuse for the way
Bobby blindsided him.

646
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,700
Tony is not
a vindictive man.

647
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,000
What did I say ?

648
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,400
You had a pretty good success
with the lipitor, right ?

649
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,400
Well, at this moment we could
also sell to you fosamax.

650
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,300
Medication for...

651
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,500
osteo... Osteporose, you know,
for the women, their bones.

652
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,300
Now, o month's
supply of fosamax,

653
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,300
<i>Four pilules --
Pills,</i></i>

654
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,700
Sells for $70 us
from the pharmacy.

655
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,000
We sell four pills
to you for $10 us.

656
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
<i>- What, are they counterfeit ?
- No no no.</i></i>

657
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,600
They're true. They're
from assurance maladie,

658
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:27,300
<i>But expiree,--
Like, old.</i></i>

659
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,500
Change the date,
nobody knows.

660
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,900
How much... fosamax
can you get ?

661
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,300
20,000 pills
every three months.

662
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,700
There some way we could
get you to lower your price ?

663
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,200
You already make
a big profit.

664
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,600
That's a good deal.

665
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,100
And we'll give you the first
pills in one week, Monday.

666
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,400
What ?

667
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,200
I cannot come
the week next

668
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,100
<i>Because ma soeur--
My sister,</i></i>

669
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,000
She has problems
in the court.

670
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,400
She got a good lawyer ?

671
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,900
Makes all the difference.

672
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Her old husband, he wants to
take the child they have together

673
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,500
To winnipeg, because
he's some drummer over there.

674
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,900
- Can you believe this ?
- She never see her son.

675
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,400
Separate a child
from his mother ?

676
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,900
I mean, what kind
of person does this ?

677
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,600
<i>I would give anything to be,
you know, debarasse of this shit.</i></i>

678
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,700
To have him gone
from her life--

679
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,700
<i>That's tough
talk, bon ami.</i></i>

680
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,400
I'm really serious.

681
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,800
I tell you what:

682
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,600
<i>You knock your price
down to 35 grande</i></i>

683
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,300
And we'll see what we can do about
making your sister's custody problem...

684
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,800
go away.

685
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,800
And I'm not talking
about a lawyer, either.

686
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,700
<i>Now, who does this ?</i></i>

687
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,000
You pay to some
drug addict ?

688
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,400
No, somebody reliable.

689
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,600
We got to talk.

690
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,000
You'll take care
of this, right ?

691
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,600
Sure.

692
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,500
No bow and arrows now.

693
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,900
<i>Ooh.</i></i>

694
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,900
Nice, huh ?

695
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,500
Bobby...

696
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,700
hi, hi.

697
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,700
Mwah !

698
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,000
Oh, how was the game ?

699
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,800
Oh, you know,
he held his own, but...

700
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,300
must have been
the new clubs.

701
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,200
- Yeah.
- Do you want to eat something ?

702
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,000
No no, I figure we
should hit the road,

703
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,800
Beat the traffic.

704
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,200
Okay.

705
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,500
You let him win.
Smart.

706
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,600
Drive carefully.

707
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,400
Here.

708
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,500
Thanks again
for my present.

709
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,700
Oh, wait till you see the shots
of aunt gemma from the '60s.

710
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,400
You forget what a beauty
she was before the steroids.

711
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,900
- Bobby, you're a wonderful host.
- It was our pleasure.

712
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,500
Gobye. When nica
wakes up from her nap,

713
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,200
Give her a belly
smooch from us.

714
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,400
Okay. Bye.

715
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,300
He broke your balls about
the fight, didn't he ?

716
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,000
No, he didn't.

717
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,600
<i>Bobby ?</i></i>

718
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,000
Where are you going ?

719
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,500
- It's business, jan.
- Now ?

720
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,700
- Yeah.
- Well, when are you coming back ?

721
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,300
I'm not sure.
A couple days.

722
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,600
A couple of days ? The
salernos are coming tomorrow.

723
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,500
Stop fucking nagging me.

724
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,800
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

725
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,800
<i>- Allo, natalie.
- Salut.</i></i>

726
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,300
Yeah ?

727
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,200
<i>Some news about this gun charge:</i></i>

728
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,700
<i>- It's not going away.
- You said they dropped it.</i></i>

729
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,800
Essex county did, but now looks
like the feds took it over.

730
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,100
<i>Fuck.</i></i>

731
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,800
What happened to
"it's a piece-Of-Shit case" ?

732
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,100
It is.
Unwinnable.

733
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,200
But fold it into a Rico,
it adds a predicate.

734
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,800
Good news is if they
had what they needed

735
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,500
We'd be having this
conversation through glass.

736
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,600
I gotta go.

737
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,300
Girls, let's do
the tea now.

738
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,500
Pour a little
for Jamie too.

739
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,300
- Bobby, finally !
- Hey, Bobby.

740
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,900
Daddy !

741
