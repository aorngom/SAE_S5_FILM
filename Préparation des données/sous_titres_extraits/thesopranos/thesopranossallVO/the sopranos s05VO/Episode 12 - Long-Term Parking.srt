1
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,100
Walter, hey, you looking for me?

2
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,400
The Crazy Horse, that's you, right?

3
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,500
- Yeah, you got something?
- Yeah, pole camera, three days ago.

4
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,000
She locks up the club for the night.

5
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,400
She's throwing away the garbage.

6
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,700
Yeah?

7
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,100
But then she changes her mind.

8
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,400
Interesting.

9
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,900
The good news is no polyps.

10
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,600
The bad news is, as you can see,

11
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,700
you've got a fairly severe case
of ulcerative colitis.

12
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,100
- Jesus Christ.
- She was getting better.

13
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,100
Then last week, another flare-up.

14
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,200
How about the Prozac? Is it helping?

15
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,500
She can't even sleep. Look at her.

16
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,000
I'd like to start you on a regime
of Prednisone. It's a steroid.

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,700
- Like for weightlifters?
- I've had great success

18
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,700
treating this type of condition.

19
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,800
I do need to warn you,
there are certain side effects.

20
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
These are temporary,
but there's a chance of weight gain,

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
accompanied by Cushing's Syndrome,
a swelling of the facial features.

22
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,500
- Sort of a moon face.
- What?

23
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,100
You've seen Jerry Lewis
in the last year or two?

24
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,900
She's planning a wedding, for Christ's sake!

25
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,500
It was fine one day,
then suddenly audio and no picture.

26
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,500
- Somebody been fooling around with this?
- AJ had his friends over.

27
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
How'd he do over there with your dad?

28
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,500
- Raking the driveway?
- Fine.

29
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,300
Except my mother kept asking him
if we were getting back together.

30
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,600
You know, I dreamed
that I moved back in here.

31
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,300
You know, just for the record...

32
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,200
I realise what I did was wrong.

33
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,000
My...

34
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,400
activities while I lived here.

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,900
Knowing you were wrong isn't the half of it.

36
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,400
Oh, really? What's the other half?

37
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,100
Well, suppose something
did happen where...

38
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,500
theoretically, we did get back together.

39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,900
- Any marriage would need fidelity.
- Like Popeye says, "I am what I am."

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Well, I didn't marry a cartoon.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,100
Well, it wouldn't be a cartoon.

42
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,500
You had your own indiscretions yourself.

43
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,500
- The thing with Furio?
- I did not sleep with him, Tony.

44
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,300
I'm just saying that we're all human,
that's all.

45
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,100
You know, the truth is, I got myself where I am.

46
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,900
But your open indiscretion, total disregard...

47
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,800
You're right, it was... it was horrible.

48
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,300
A knot in your stomach when the phone rings.

49
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,200
Like you were saying, you know.

50
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,200
Theoretically though, if we do reconcile,

51
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,500
that stuff will never happen again.

52
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,100
- Come on, you gonna go or what?
- I was finishing my drink.

53
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,300
Fuck!

54
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,000
You can't stay holed up here.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,200
- That's not healthy, Carmine.
- How'd it get to this?

56
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,900
Retaliation, counterattacks...

57
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,300
We're at a fuckin' stagmire.

58
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,800
We back down now, bunker down,

59
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,500
what kind of a message does that send?

60
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,300
Not just to Johnny's people, either.
Billy Leotardo. What the hell was that?

61
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,400
This Blundetto asshole went off
the reservation.

62
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,200
All due respect, Carmine,

63
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,300
that's why you need to get out there,

64
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,500
put your ear to the street,
let the guys see you take the reins.

65
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,700
That's not how I wanna handle it.

66
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,900
Hey, don't get me wrong,
I always liked your cousin,

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,700
but whacking Phil's brother
was a major poke in the ass.

68
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,200
You know my cousin almost cried
when I put him in charge of the casino?

69
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,600
After all I did for that blue-eyed prick,
then he completely fucks me over.

70
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,700
Now I practically gotta get
down on my knees to Johnny Sack.

71
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,900
Where the fuck you been?

72
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,500
Highway was jammed with broken heroes
on a last-chance power drive.

73
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,900
Oh, you're gonna get fuckin' cute now.

74
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,000
- Anything on Tony B?
- Nah, he's still on a milk carton.

75
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,500
There she is.

76
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,500
My Smelly Valentine.

77
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,400
Christopher, that's not funny.

78
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,500
What the fuck are you doing?

79
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,800
I can handle a cocktail once in a while.

80
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
You guys OK? You need anything else?

81
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,600
- You're still feeling sick, hon?
- Please.

82
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,800
They gotta replace her colon with a semi-colon.

83
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,200
Maybe you should be a vegan.

84
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,200
- Doctor says I gotta relax.
- From what?

85
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,000
She's got the world at her feet,
she walks around like impending doom.

86
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,700
Come on, we gotta go.

87
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Take it easy, now.

88
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,200
Don't listen. People who've got
their health take it for granted.

89
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,200
How's your thing with...?

90
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,700
Just gotta keep an eye on it, that's all.

91
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,200
So, Carm and me are getting back together,
maybe.

92
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,200
That's great. The kids'll be thrilled.

93
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,100
Yeah. When we get settled,
we'll have you guys over...

94
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
Family dinner.

95
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,800
Feel better, huh?

96
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,200
John.

97
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,600
First off, let me just say how sorry
I am for your loss. We all are.

98
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,600
Take your fuckin' sorrys
and stick 'em in your ass.

99
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,100
I could say nothing, be a heartless prick.

100
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,300
He tried to talk, he couldn't
even say his last words.

101
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,700
Anybody ever die in your arms,
you cocksucker?

102
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,800
A family member, somebody you love?

103
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
- No.
- Well, give it time.

104
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,200
See if I can't make that happen for you.

105
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
- That's enough.
- Philly, why don't you go have a drink?

106
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't tell me what to do, Jimmy.

107
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,400
Jimmy's right.

108
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,000
Fuck 'em, John. Fuck all of them!

109
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,000
Was that fuckin' necessary?
He shouldn't even have been here.

110
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He's got a right to be here.

111
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,400
He's got a right to a lot of things right now.

112
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,800
My cousin acted alone. I did not sanction this.

113
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
The lone-gunman theory.

114
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,600
You know how close he and Angelo were
in the can. He flipped the fuck out!

115
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,300
When he whacked Joey,
what flipped him out then?

116
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,700
What do ya want, John?
What do ya want me to say?

117
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,500
I want your cousin on a fucking spit!

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,800
I don't know where he is.

119
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,000
- Nobody does.
- Fine.

120
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,500
Maybe one of your other relatives then.

121
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,000
What, I gotta stand here
being threatened now?

122
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,400
All right, nobody's making threats.

123
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,500
Look, Tony's in hiding.

124
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,700
You either deliver that prick to my door
or I will rain a shitstorm

125
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,300
down on you and your family
like you have never fucking seen.

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,700
We're done here.

127
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,100
There are over 200,000 species of molluscs,

128
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,500
and right there is a good example
of a conch,

129
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,200
which is also known as a knobbed whelk.

130
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,600
See, these raised spines...

131
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,100
That's what I call my dick.

132
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,400
I heard that.

133
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,300
That's just nasty.

134
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,800
Oh, fuck! Yo, check it!

135
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,500
Oh, shit! Hurry up!

136
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,600
Don't touch it!

137
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,800
Apprentice Delaney, get back here!

138
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,300
Little Meadow in a bridal gown.

139
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,600
Couple more years, Grandma and Grandpa.

140
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,800
Bite your tongue.

141
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,600
So, the other day,
what you said, I processed it.

142
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,400
You know, your feelings.

143
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,600
It really hit home with me, finally.

144
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,700
With you out of the house,
I've had a chance to do a lot of thinking.

145
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,800
I mean, it's partly my fault

146
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,700
but I need something else in my life.

147
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,200
You know, with Meadow
getting engaged, AJ almost...

148
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,400
You want another kid.

149
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,900
No.

150
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,500
It turns out there is a lot
for sale over on Crestview,

151
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,500
a little over an acre.

152
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I was thinking I could build a spec house

153
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,000
and take my dad in as a partner.

154
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
I mean, my allowance is what it is, but...

155
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,000
- How much is the lot?
- 600,000.

156
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,900
Anyway, he would oversee the construction.

157
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, I'll call Ginsberg and...

158
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,200
have him free up a down payment.

159
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,300
And then?

160
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,900
I'll move back in.

161
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,700
Supposing that happened, what about
the other issues that were on the table?

162
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,700
Well...

163
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,700
I swear to you, on our children,

164
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:38,700
that my midlife crisis problems will
no longer intrude on you any more.

165
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,800
Are you having dinner?

166
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,600
- Have you settled on a caterer yet?
- Can I talk to you?

167
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,800
- You hear from Tony?
- I talked to Kelvin... Calvin... whatever.

168
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,700
That redneck from North Carolina.

169
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,200
The Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco called.

170
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,500
A bodega in Newark's selling
cigarettes without tax stamps.

171
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Stupid spics were supposed
to stamp 'em themselves.

172
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
The feds are all over it now.

173
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,900
I don't got enough on my fuckin' mind?

174
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,800
- Any idea how you're gonna handle that?
- Handle what?

175
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,100
Our cousin, you know, Phil and John.

176
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,500
I don't know, I gotta think about it.

177
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,700
From now on, Paulie supervises
the cigarette run. You split everything with him.

178
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,600
- What?
- You fuckin' heard me.

179
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,900
I got a fuckin' wedding to pay for.

180
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,300
Well, if I were you, I'd cut out the open bar!

181
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,300
Fuck this piece of shit.
I'm done! You hear me?

182
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,700
Put my life on the line! My fuckin' life!

183
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,800
Baby, I hate seeing you like this.

184
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,300
Fuck family, fuck loyalty.

185
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,900
You cost him a dime, you're a fuckin' pariah.

186
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,400
I gave that fuck pieces of my soul, Adriana.

187
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,600
You know what he said to me?

188
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,100
- He said I should have a fuckin' drink!
- When?

189
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,500
Up there, when we were up
at Uncle Pat's farm.

190
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,800
You don't need to listen to him.
Isn't that why you have a sponsor?

191
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,300
Him and Tony B, breaking my balls,

192
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,600
teasing me like when I was little.

193
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,600
What kind of fucked-up,
undermining shit is that

194
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,200
to tell someone who's got the disease?

195
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,800
You know I could take him out
in a second, that fat fuck. Bang!

196
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,000
His kids wouldn't even give a shit.

197
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,400
Don't talk like that. You're a better man
than he is, a better person.

198
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,400
Fuck all this shit with Paulie.

199
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,900
You know what hurts me worse,
right to my heart?

200
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,900
Him and our ass-wipe cousin,
that two-faced cocksucker.

201
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,500
He could get us all killed with New York
and him...

202
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,400
Tony has to think about
what to do with him now, after all this shit!

203
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,400
Me, he don't need to fuckin' think!

204
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
Well, maybe I need to think!

205
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,300
Ever thought of that, you fat fuckin' scumbag?

206
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,400
That's the guy, Adriana.

207
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,600
My uncle Tony.

208
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,200
The guy I'm going to hell for.

209
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,200
- Long Branch cops.
- What do you think?

210
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,700
Not your average bulls... detectives.

211
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,900
Call the Long Branch PD, find out what's up.

212
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,300
So, you all set?

213
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,400
- Don't look at me.
- Why? Ya look good!

214
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,400
And you're gonna look nice
with the short hair.

215
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,200
Like whatshername...

216
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,000
- That actress.
- Just take me home.

217
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,300
I can drop you off, but I really can't stay.

218
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,200
Why not?

219
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,100
All right, look. First off, like I said before,

220
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,100
as far as all the medical bills
and the prescriptions,

221
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,200
that's covered, ad nauseam.

222
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,800
- You motherfucker.
- Hey, take it easy.

223
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,800
This is how you leave me?

224
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,900
I'm almost burned to death
cooking you a fucking snack?

225
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,600
You could've been making yourself something.

226
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,100
- Am I that fuckin' horrible now?
- No. You're not horrible at all.

227
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm going back to my wife.

228
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You selfish fuck.

229
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,500
I hate you.

230
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,500
There's just no future with us,
I told you that from the get-go.

231
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,000
That's why I didn't want you hitching
your wagon to my star.

232
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,700
You'll heal up. You'll meet somebody else.

233
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Fuck you!

234
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,000
I didn't come here to fight, I came here to pick
you up and end this like a gentleman.

235
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
I'm gonna fuckin' kill myself.

236
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
I gotta take this.

237
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,700
Is that you?

238
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,100
I know you're there, just say something.
Where the fuck are...?

239
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,100
Your call cannot be...

240
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,900
- The Bing.
- Yeah, it's me.

241
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,300
Have your friend at the phone company
call me.

242
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,300
- Who, Gerard?
- I want to put traps on all my lines.

243
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,400
Jesus. What?

244
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,800
- We need to talk.
- I was buying medicine.

245
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,400
- This way, please.
- But my car!

246
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,900
Hello?

247
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,700
Give me a hand, will you?

248
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,600
I got more stuff in the car, so...

249
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,400
- Where should I put it?
- In the bedroom.

250
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,500
Oh, you made it.
Hey, I was just starting dinner.

251
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,900
Yeah, it smells good.

252
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,700
- What is this?
- I got you something small.

253
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,700
Oh, this is beautiful!

254
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,600
With my black coat.

255
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,500
It's a Hermès. Supposed to be the best.

256
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,900
There's the whipped butter too, if you like.

257
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,500
This is all right.

258
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,800
This is fuckin' weird.

259
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,500
- AJ...
- No, he's right.

260
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,900
It is fuckin' weird.

261
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,900
You know what? We should celebrate.

262
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,100
Here, give me your glass.

263
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,600
The trick is, you gotta hold the cork,
don't let it fly out.

264
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,800
Gab's uncle got a detached retina

265
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,900
at his retirement party.
He never saw outta that eye again.

266
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
That's festive.

267
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,100
I wanna make a toast.

268
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
To the people I love.

269
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,600
Nothing else matters.

270
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,000
Hear, hear.

271
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,500
Slow down.

272
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
You're supposed to savour it.

273
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,400
It's important in life.

274
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,100
- Open the door for Mr Mucklel
- What?

275
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,700
- Open the door for Mr Muckle the blind man.
- Call 'em off my kumquatsl

276
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
- What'd you say?
- Kumquatsl

277
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,600
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
It's all right. It's all right.

278
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
All right.

279
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,300
- So?
- I was throwing the garbage out.

280
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,700
So what? Isn't that illegal anyway,
to film people without telling 'em?

281
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,300
And the reason you didn't just leave
the garbage in the dumpster?

282
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,200
Bills and stuff.
Our account numbers were on it.

283
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,600
- Friend of yours?
- Jesus Christ.

284
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
His name is Gilbert Nieves.

285
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,400
Partial traces of an infrared stamp
on his hand from The Crazy Horse.

286
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,800
I don't know him.

287
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,700
You told the police
that he was at the club that night.

288
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,100
Let me ask you
a question, Miss La Cerva.

289
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,100
Do you really think we don't know
what's in that garbage bag?

290
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,800
He was stabbed in the club.

291
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,900
You tried to dispose of the evidence.

292
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,100
- I didn't do nothing.
- Miss La Cerva.

293
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,100
I suggest in the strongest possible terms

294
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,500
that you start telling us what you know.

295
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
There's this guy, his name's Matush.

296
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,400
He's a drug dealer.
He did it. I swear, not me.

297
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,300
What's Matush's last name?

298
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,700
I don't know. He's foreign, the Mid East
or something... Pakistan.

299
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,600
Anyway, Christopher don't
let him deal in the club,

300
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,400
but once in a while he'd sell me
some X or whatever.

301
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,900
This is my friend Kamal.

302
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,900
Listen, I need a favour.
We're trying to get an apartment.

303
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,900
I gotta fax a copy of my passport.

304
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:46,200
- You can't go to Kinko's?
- The guy's waiting. Two seconds, I swear.

305
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,500
It's in the office, but hurry.
If Christopher sees you, he'll shit.

306
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,400
That's for you.

307
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,900
This guy was at the club, the dead guy,
but I never saw him before.

308
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,000
Matush said he sold him coke once,

309
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,100
but the guy said Matush
ripped him off, it was all laxative.

310
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,100
Oh, boy.

311
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,700
What's the number again?

312
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,900
Hey, yo, you can't be back here, man.

313
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,300
Cool out, yo! What are ya doing?

314
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,100
- Give me my money.
- What?

315
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,000
Don't get stupid in here.

316
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,900
Fuck off, I got no beef with you.

317
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,700
You still sell that beat shit, huh?
Fuckin' baby powder?

318
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,700
- Look, I don't know...
- Get him!

319
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,300
I'll kill you motherfuckers! I'll kill you!

320
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,500
Oh, my God!

321
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,600
We had to wait till later to get out
the mops and stuff,

322
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,700
after we closed up.

323
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,500
- If Christopher...
- Nobody has to know anything.

324
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,000
- But you don't fuckin' understand!
- It's cool, OK?

325
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,300
We'll take him out through the basement.

326
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Dump him in the ocean.

327
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,400
Why'd you help this Matush?

328
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,400
I wasn't helping him, I was afraid for myself.

329
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,600
Besides, he's nice. I don't know.
I didn't wanna see him get into trouble.

330
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,000
- Sounds like a real sweetheart.
- The guy was gonna stab him!

331
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,600
He's not a bad person. He's very religious.

332
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,000
- Religious?
- He prays, like, all the time.

333
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,100
He went through a period
of rediscovering his religion.

334
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,800
He don't even do drugs any more,
he just deals.

335
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,100
Every month he sends all
his money home to his family.

336
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,800
- In Pakistan?
- His brother runs a prep school.

337
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,100
Some place for young boys.

338
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,300
I was very impressed with that.

339
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,900
He's buckled down.
He's much more serious as a person.

340
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,100
- Does Christopher know what happened?
- No! Are you crazy?

341
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,800
You're guilty of obstructing an ongoing
investigation into a drug-related homicide.

342
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,900
You are looking at 25 years.

343
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,200
- But I didn't do nothing.
- Take your head out of your ass.

344
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,800
- You knew what you were doing.
- We can arrest you now, have you charged,

345
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,400
send you over
to the women's house of detention.

346
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,700
Or in the alternative you can cooperate.

347
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,000
But I've been fuckin' cooperating!

348
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,200
You've been giving us shit,
and I've had it!

349
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,000
I want you wired up!
I want Tony Soprano on tape!

350
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,700
- Your boyfriend too!
- No, I'm not doing it!

351
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,500
Then you're all out of options!

352
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,600
I wanna talk to my lawyer.

353
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,700
Fine, who's your lawyer?

354
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,100
I don't have an official one.

355
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:38,000
- Maybe Christopher knows a good lawyer.
- Oh, you fuckin' piece of shit.

356
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,300
I'll call the Public Defender,
they'll send someone down.

357
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,000
Might take awhile, though,
this hour of the night.

358
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,300
I think I left some shoes over there.

359
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,500
I can iron these tomorrow.

360
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,100
- What for? Send 'em to the cleaners.
- I kinda miss it actually.

361
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,500
My wrist is getting weak.

362
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,200
- I could help you there.
- Get outta here.

363
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,800
No, let's give it some exercise.

364
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,700
- What?
- Stop.

365
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:41,300
Hi, it's Ade. Ma, if this is you, another gift
for the registry could be a decanter.

366
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,100
It's me. Where are you?

367
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,200
We may be doing it at our house.

368
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,600
We've only got the one leaf for 16 people.

369
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Could you do a buffet? Maybe set a card table
up for the kids?

370
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,600
It's our first holiday.
Ronnie wants us all together.

371
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,500
Ade? It's been 40 minutes.
How long you gonna stay in there?

372
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,000
How long will you let me go
without a lawyer?

373
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I told you, they're backed up.
We left four messages.

374
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,800
Eight fuckin' hours I've been here already.

375
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,700
- Jesus Christ, look at me.
- You want some coffee?

376
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,500
I can't, my stomach.

377
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,800
I wish you'd think about our offer.
It's not a bad deal.

378
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,400
I won't wear a wire, I told you. It's bad enough
how I betrayed him already.

379
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,800
It's not too late to have a future, Ade.
There are other options.

380
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,000
Don't start with
the Witness Protection again.

381
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,600
You love each other. You have your health.

382
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,800
Yeah, right.

383
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,700
Living like this
is what's costing you your insides.

384
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,700
- I really need a cigarette.
- OK. Come on.

385
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,100
There's no way she'll wear a wire,
but she might get Moltisanti to flip.

386
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,300
- Why now?
- Problems with Tony.

387
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,700
- Christopher hates him.
- That's confirmed by wiretaps.

388
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,700
Cl12 mentioned it too. Something to do
with Tony Blundetto, the cousin.

389
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,600
- What would Moltisanti want?
- I'm not sure.

390
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,600
- He's got some interest in screenwriting.
- Put in a call to Sam Goldwyn.

391
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,200
Promise her anything?

392
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,000
Depending on what he's offering, maybe
immunity and relocation for the two of them.

393
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,000
She's got to understand
that if she won't wear a wire,

394
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,700
we can't offer her protection or surveillance.

395
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,800
- I explained all that.
- She's got till 9am Monday

396
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,500
to bring him in or we turn her over
to Long Branch PD.

397
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,700
Tone, you got a call.

398
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,300
Jimmy Petrille, Brooklyn.

399
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,700
- Hello.
- It's me.

400
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,800
That tennis match with those guys?
My guy won.

401
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,900
- Oh, yeah?
- The other one, the son.

402
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,900
- He dropped out.
- What, he got hurt?

403
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,200
Nothing like that. Settled, that's all.

404
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,100
All right.

405
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,700
- Little Carmine's out.
- He's dead?

406
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,700
Seems like him and Johnny worked out a deal.

407
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,900
I knew he'd cave. He's a fuckin' pussy, that kid.

408
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,200
Johnny Sack, boss of a family.

409
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,600
Time was it would've been great
for us to have John as the boss.

410
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,000
Smart as a fuckin' whip.
He used to be a pragmatist.

411
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,100
Some people are better at being number twos.

412
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,200
You thought John had an ego before?
Forget it now.

413
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,400
- Did you sleep?
- A little.

414
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,100
- So where the fuck you been?
- Christopher, we need to talk.

415
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,600
- I asked you a question, Adriana.
- I know.

416
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,700
There's something I need to tell you.

417
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,500
- It's that fuckin' Bobby DeMarco?
- No!

418
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Please, Christopher.

419
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,000
I gotta get through this.

420
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,600
About a year ago...

421
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,000
more maybe, I don't know...

422
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,300
- I was arrested.
- For what? What are you talking about?

423
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,800
- For drugs.
- Where, at the club?

424
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,100
- You remember my friend Danielle?
- She set you up?

425
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,800
She was an FBI agent, Christopher.

426
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,400
She lied to me. They wanted
to arrest you too, Christopher.

427
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,100
I was just trying to protect you.

428
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:10,000
They said all they wanted was some
information and they would leave us alone.

429
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,600
I didn't tell them nothing, I swear to God...

430
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,800
Just licence plates, some other stupid shit.

431
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,000
They wanted me to wear a wire,
but I wouldn't do it.

432
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,200
But now there was a murder, Christopher,
and they know about it.

433
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,100
At the club, Matush and some other guy.

434
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:36,100
I tried to cover it up, but I had no choice.

435
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,700
They've been filming us in the parking lot.

436
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,400
We're dead, you know that?

437
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,600
What did you do, huh?
How could you fuckin' do this to us?

438
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,200
I fuckin' loved you!

439
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,100
I'm sorry.

440
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,900
My God!

441
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,500
What are we gonna do?

442
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Careful here, my son.

443
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,400
- Hello.
- T, it's me.

444
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,600
You awake?

445
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,100
I know you're mad, OK?

446
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,400
I'm sorry.
When I heard about Angelo I just...

447
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Don't say it. Not on the phone.

448
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
I know, I won't.

449
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,900
- What should I do?
- I'll tell you what not to do.

450
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,300
- That's come back around here.
- I know.

451
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,300
I know, but... my kids, my boys.

452
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,300
Don't worry. I'll look after them.

453
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Yeah, well, that's...
that's why I'm calling, to ask...

454
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,000
Sure, why not?

455
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,800
Anything else I can do for you?

456
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,500
I don't know what to say, cuz.

457
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
I'm leaving you with shit in your lap.

458
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,100
- Hello?
- The night you went away,

459
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,100
you know, 17 years ago,

460
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,400
I told you that I got jumped
by a couple of shines.

461
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
That's why I didn't show.

462
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,100
It was all bullshit.

463
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,800
I got in a fight with my mother and passed out.

464
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,100
- What do you mean?
- I don't know. It was like a panic attack.

465
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:29,100
I went down like a house of cards
and I cracked my fuckin' skull open.

466
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,200
Why are you telling me all this?

467
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,000
I felt guilty about it all these years,
like it was my fault you went away.

468
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,800
Anyway, now we're even.

469
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,100
So the casino, all that shit you did
for me is cos of that?

470
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,500
You just take care of yourself, all right?

471
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,400
You too.

472
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Hello?

473
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,100
Gerard, it's me.

474
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,000
- He just called.
- Give me a sec, I'll dump the line.

475
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,100
- You got a pen?
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

476
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:31,000
He's at Roy's. It's a business, Kinderhook,
New York. That's upstate.

477
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,400
Yeah, I know where it is. Thanks.

478
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,500
- Hello?
- Uncle Pat.

479
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,300
- How's life at the old folks' home?
- I don't like the people here.

480
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,200
- Do you know what time it is?
- I thought you were a night owl.

481
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,300
Did I hear a rumour there was a problem
up there at the farm?

482
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,800
The goddamn developer.
Some environmental crap.

483
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,900
They can't start the demolition
without some special permit.

484
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,500
And the house is sitting there empty,
damn it.

485
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,800
Remember that... that time at Lake George,

486
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,400
how you loved it?

487
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,400
We could live someplace like that, maybe.

488
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,500
- You could start writing again.
- I could do my memoirs, finally.

489
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,000
And we'd have a fireplace like you like too.

490
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,500
We could never come back here, Adriana.

491
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,700
I don't wanna come back. I just want you.

492
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,100
You couldn't even see your mother again.

493
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,600
You want some eggs?

494
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
I need to clear my head.

495
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,100
- You didn't even sleep.
- This is a lot to process.

496
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,700
I gotta think. I'll be back in a little while.

497
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,100
Stay, wait.

498
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,600
I'm gonna get cigarettes. I'll be right back.

499
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,800
Smoke mine. Don't smoke.

500
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,000
- Next you're gonna want a vodka.
- What? Come on.

501
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
I love you, baby.

502
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,900
I love you.

503
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,400
Hello.

504
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,400
- He wants to do it.
- Great, when are you coming in?

505
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,900
A couple hours.
We'll get some things together.

506
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,900
That's not what we said, Ade.

507
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,300
Please, if I push him he'll say no.
I know how he is.

508
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,300
I'm serious, Adriana. You've got till one o'clock.

509
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,200
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me.

510
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,800
Look, everything's OK.

511
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,600
Jesus, I don't even know how to say this.

512
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
It's Christopher. He tried to commit suicide.

513
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,900
- My God, is he all right?
- He's fine.

514
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,400
He was up by Ramapo,
apparently he took some pills.

515
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,900
A trooper found him in a bathroom of this diner.

516
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,800
They brought him to the hospital.

517
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,200
His mom's on her way up there now.

518
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,200
Did he say anything to you?

519
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,800
I mean, did he appear suicidal?

520
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,000
- No.
- Are you sure?

521
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,500
His mom said he's
very upset about something.

522
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,300
Anyway, I'm on my way up there now.

523
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,900
I'm gonna send Sil by to pick you up then, OK?

524
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,400
- Jesus Christ.
- You know he's been drinking.

525
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,400
He's probably fighting that heroin urge again.

526
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,500
- Anyway, Sil's on his way.
- OK.

527
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,900
All right. I'll see ya up there.

528
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,800
I'd stop to eat, but I don't wanna
get to the hospital after Tony.

529
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
I'm not hungry.

530
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,300
They'll keep him a few days, maybe.

531
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,400
Observation, do some tests,

532
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,700
who knows?

533
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,900
He's a strong kid.

534
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,400
He's tough, very resilient.

535
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,300
Why are you crying? He's gonna be fine.

536
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,600
- No, please!
- Come on. Come on.

537
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,600
- Where you fuckin' going?
- Please!

538
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,400
Come on, come on! Fuckin' cunt!

539
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,400
- Please! No.
- Come out of there.

540
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,100
This is long-term parking only.

541
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:11,400
Due to increased security,
cars being reclaimed in less than 14 days

542
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,800
must be left in lots L, M or N.

543
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,900
This is long-term parking only.

544
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,400
Due to increased security,
cars being reclaimed in less than 14 days

545
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,900
must be left in lots L, M or N.

546
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,300
The King of New York.

547
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,600
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Tony.

548
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,800
You deserve it.

549
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:55,000
I want you to know this is the last time
we'll meet like this. It's undignified.

550
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,400
So, what's the word on your cousin?

551
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,600
I think I know where he's holed up.

552
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,000
And?

553
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,600
I know this has to be done, John,

554
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,100
but I'm asking you now as a friend.

555
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,100
- Let me handle this myself.
- I can't do that, Tony.

556
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,000
You can do whatever the fuck you want,
you're the fuckin' boss.

557
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,200
I choose not to, then.

558
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
I want your promise it'll be quick.

559
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,200
I'm not gonna lie to you, Tony, I don't have to.

560
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,500
Phil's gonna do it, and he'll do it his way.

561
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,700
This is me now. Come on.

562
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,200
Anything else?

563
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,200
No.

564
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,700
You know what, John? I'll give you undignified.

565
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,100
Go fuck yourself.

566
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,100
You and Phil and whoever.

567
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,000
He's my fuckin' cousin.

568
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,700
- You all right?
- This is some funny shit.

569
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,600
What the fuck is wrong with you?

570
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,700
I snorted a little H.

571
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,200
I know, but...

572
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,000
I can't stand the pain. I loved her.

573
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,900
Fuckin' pain, huh?

574
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,000
You think you're alone in this?

575
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,800
It was a judgment call. She sounded OK.

576
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,600
The status on Moltisanti?

577
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,900
Seen yesterday leaving the Bing with Tony.

578
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,600
- Should we bring him in?
- That'll get us nothing.

579
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,400
She really could have fled.
She could be in China by now.

580
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,300
How should we handle the Nieves murder?

581
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,300
We have the terror possibility.

582
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,900
Take it over from the Long Branch PD.

583
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,000
Well, what did I say, is it beautiful?

584
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Yeah, it's a gorgeous piece of land.

585
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,900
With this view, it's well worth 600,000.

586
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,400
The surveyor's coming on Tuesday.

587
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,300
- You all right?
- Yeah. Me? Yeah.

588
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,900
Absolutely.

589
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,900
English
