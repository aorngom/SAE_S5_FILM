1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,300
# You woke up
this morning #

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,700
# Got yourself a gun #

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,900
# Your momma always said
you'd be the Chosen One #

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,300
# She said you're...
you're one in a million #

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,600
# You've got
to burn to shine #

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,600
# But you were
born under a bad sign #

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,400
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,200
# When you
woke up this morning #

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,100
# And all that love
had gone #

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,300
# Your papa never
told you about #

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,800
# Right and wrong #

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,100
# But you're...
you're looking good, baby #

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,500
# I believe that
you're feeling fine #

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,200
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,700
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,900
- # So sing it now #
- # Woke up this morning #

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,500
# Got a blue moon...
got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah #

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
# Woke up this morning #

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,900
# You say you woke up
this morning #

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,000
# The world
turned upside down #

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,300
# Lordy, well,
things ain't been the same #

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,600
# Since the blues
walked in our town #

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,000
# But you're... but you're
one in a million #

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,400
# 'Cause you got that
shotgun shine #

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,500
# With a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah #

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,500
# Woke up
this morning #

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,700
- # Uh-huh #
- # And got yourself a gun #

29
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,700
- # Woke up this morning #
- # Got yourself a gun #

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,200
- # Uh-huh #
- # Got yourself a gun. #

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,900
Here he is,
Mr. Clean.

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,000
- Want some coffee?
- Where's your dirties?

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,800
I'll get 'em.

34
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,400
What?

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,700
I don't know.
It's... it's...

36
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,300
it's hard seeing you
like this.

37
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,300
What, working,
with a real job?

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,000
It's like I've been telling Feech,
it's been a long strange trip.

39
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,700
Feech?

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,900
Anyway, it's the luck
of the draw, that shit.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,600
Could've just as easily
been me that went away.

42
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,200
Come on, I was gonna be there
that night of the hijack.

43
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, it ain't like you
came away totally unscathed.

44
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,100
No, a couple of goons jumped me
and cut my head open.

45
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,800
I couldn't go.
Still...

46
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,800
They could've killed ya.
You ended up in the E.R.

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,600
Got 16 stitches.
You got 15 years.

48
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,600
You always were
a lucky fuck.

49
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,600
Well, that's not
completely true.

50
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,300
I got a lotta sorrows
in my life.

51
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,700
Like him for example.

52
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,900
Thanks for lunch.

53
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,800
Stick with me, kid, I'll have ya eating
lunch like that every day.

54
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,600
I'm serious about
this massage therapy.

55
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,100
Well, you should keep a square job
like that for appearances.

56
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,000
Look at me
with the bakery.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,500
I told my cousin
I wanna stay a civilian.

58
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,800
Ah, yes.
The boy king.

59
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,200
Can I trust you if I talk to you
frankly about him?

60
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,000
- What are you doing?
- I gotta make a stop.

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,900
What the fuck you doing?

62
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,600
- Excuse me?
- What the fuck are you doing?

63
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,300
I'm trimming a lawn.

64
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,900
My nephew does the lawns
in this neighborhood.

65
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,200
I been working this
neighborhood for 26 years.

66
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,800
Are you fucking deaf?
I said my nephew has this area,

67
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,200
- Gary La Manna.
- Fuck off, huh? I'm busy here.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,400
You want me
to fuck off?!

69
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,100
How about I fuck off all over
your stupid fucking face,

70
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,500
you fucking mutt? Huh?

71
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,100
You don't work
this neighborhood!

72
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,400
Jesus Christ,
we're on parole.

73
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,900
What the fuck
you doing?

74
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,000
Anthony said the cable
box has to be on.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,700
It's on,
I'm doing it.

76
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,000
But let me tell ya,
our glass house couples

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,700
could probably decorate
in about 24 hours.

78
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,000
They have to,
each week.

79
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,800
Tony's whole life
was horses...

80
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
- No, it's not her.
- That's Judy!

81
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,300
- No, it's not Judy!
- The fuck?

82
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,900
- Yes, it is, of course it is.
- Why am I on there?

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,100
- What?
- Holy shit. I've seen Judy!

84
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,200
- That's not you.
- What's that, my trial?

85
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,400
...know the eyes.
- No, I do know the eyes...

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,500
Come on!
I've seen my daughter call her Judy!

87
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,700
- Sweet Judy Brown Eyes...
- That's Bobby.

88
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,500
What the fuck is this?

89
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,300
Junior, it's not you,
it's a TV program, a movie.

90
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,900
Judy, what?

91
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,500
Ton', he's here.

92
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,200
- Tony, hey, thanks for seeing me.
- How are ya?

93
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,200
How are you?

94
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,300
You want something?
Coffee, bialy?

95
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,900
No, I'm good,
thank you.

96
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,600
What's on your mind?

97
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,100
Well, honestly, I'll get
right to the point.

98
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,300
As regards
to your uncle,

99
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,100
'cause of the promotion
and all,

100
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,400
I kinda thought I'd be
out on the street more.

101
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,700
Staying off the street
nowadays is a good thing, no?

102
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,200
- It's a joke.
- I know, I mean I'm not complaining.

103
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,300
It's just it's over a year,
and I'm still

104
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,100
- picking up prescriptions.
- What do ya need, money?

105
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,100
All I want is
a chance to earn.

106
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,500
I mean, I'm happy to do it,
it's just 40 minutes

107
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,100
I spent at Rite Aids yesterday

108
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,900
getting him some stool softener
that was on sale.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,500
With Jan and the kids
to feed now...

110
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,600
How's she doing anyways,
my sister?

111
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,300
She sleeps a lot.
It's hard.

112
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,100
Still with
the Epstein-Barr, huh?

113
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
It's tough on her.
I don't know...

114
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,300
two kids,
a ready-made family.

115
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,000
She's prone
to depression, frankly.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,600
Mmm.

117
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,700
I mean, not that
I have any regrets.

118
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,800
No, no, course not,
she's a good kid.

119
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,800
Look, Bobby,
marriage...

120
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,700
or any partnership for that matter,
is a give and a take.

121
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,100
All right, look.

122
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,600
I hear what you're saying,

123
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,000
but the truth
is I depend on you.

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Beppy, Tommy...
come on.

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,900
You're the only one
I can trust over there.

126
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,100
And believe it or not, it's important
to me that he's cared for.

127
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,500
All right, let me figure out
how to take care of you.

128
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Maybe you could make more
collections or something.

129
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,400
Thanks, Ton'.
I appreciate it.

130
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,300
Yeah, all right.

131
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,500
All right.

132
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,500
And Friday we have fish,

133
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,400
if you're Catholic,
so that's nice.

134
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Sounds like the Ritz.

135
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,200
Ya gotta see her,
Aunt Mary,

136
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
she's the belle
of the ball over there.

137
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,000
Here, Ma,
rest those dogs.

138
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,500
Hey, what's going on?
Nobody cutting the lawn?

139
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,300
Oh, Madonn'.
Mr. Vitro, the gardener,

140
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,700
somebody beat him up,
broke his arm.

141
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,800
- God forbid.
- Sal Vitro?

142
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,800
- Who beat him up?
- Some men in a Cadillac.

143
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,700
He was mowing a lawn
on Kimball Street.

144
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,500
The man said he didn't want him
in the neighborhood.

145
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,200
Poor Sal, what
a nice man he is.

146
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,700
He put my garbage cans out
every time he cut my grass.

147
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,800
What's his name,
Aunt Mary?

148
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,400
- Salvatore Vitro.
- Ma, the guy that beat him up.

149
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,600
Man came by and said
he was gonna cut the lawns.

150
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,400
I said, "No,
I want Mr. Vitro."

151
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,700
"E. Gary La Manna,
Landscaping."

152
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,200
- Do you know him?
- Eat your scones.

153
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,300
I'll straighten it out.

154
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,900
95.5, WPLJ in Brooklyn.

155
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,300
- Sorry, we're not open.
- What, not open?

156
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,400
A man in your position turning
away fucking business now?

157
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,600
I didn't know
it was you, Lorraine.

158
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,500
Here ya go.
That's most of it.

159
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,800
Let me ask you
a question, Dan.

160
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,100
Say I'm some big nigger standing
here instead of a woman,

161
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
you still gonna tell me
you got most of it?

162
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Let's go, chop-chop,
pay the woman.

163
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,300
Phil, hey. I was just
thinking about you.

164
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,300
Those Islander tickets,
right?

165
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,500
How about
this humidity?

166
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,700
Hey! Hey!

167
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,100
- Guys, please, whatever this is...
- Shut up.

168
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,500
Two times you were told
to kick up to fucking Johnny Sack.

169
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,900
And what do you do?
You kick up to Little Carmine?

170
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,300
- Tape her.
- No! No!

171
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,300
Little Carmine, he was
my father's friend!

172
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,900
Philly, Joey, look...
okay, okay, okay.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,200
You're right, I'm sorry.
I'll pay you, okay?

174
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,200
I'll do anything you want.
I'll suck your cock, okay?

175
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,500
All of you guys!

176
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,900
- You'll suck our cocks?
- Yeah!

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,300
She any good?

178
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,700
What am I asking you for?
You probably showed her how.

179
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,300
- Shut up.
- Please, guys.

180
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,600
Relax.
This'll muffle the shot.

181
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,800
Adios, you fucking skank.

182
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,700
Hey, look at this, Joey.

183
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Today's her lucky day.

184
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,500
Only made it to the R's.

185
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,500
Next time,
there'll be no next time.

186
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,300
Come on.

187
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,700
Take as long
as you like, no rush.

188
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,600
I've got my
"Times Crossword"

189
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,300
and Agnes here will
get you anything you need.

190
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Thanks, Mel.

191
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
So how's it
being home, Angelo?

192
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Enjoying living
with your daughter?

193
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,800
It's like paradise.
I eat like a pharaoh,

194
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,000
- I got my own room, cable TV.
- I have cable.

195
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
My grandson,
he asked me... he says,

196
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,600
how come he never met
his grandpa before?

197
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,300
I said, "Because Grandpa's
been in Special Forces."

198
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,100
First he was
afraid of me,

199
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,300
but I said, "Come on,
we'll get some ice cream.

200
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,600
- We'll go to the park. It'll be..."
- Well anyway,

201
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,100
- here we all are.
- Right.

202
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,700
I called you boys because Lorraine
calls me and she said

203
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,200
there's a situation in our family
that's gotten outta hand

204
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,800
- with John and Little Carmine.
- This fucking Johnny,

205
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,200
he wouldn't even let
the maggots get on Carmine

206
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,400
before he's telling me
to kick up direct to him.

207
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,900
Problem is Carmine
never named a successor.

208
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,700
We all assumed
it'd be Johnny

209
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,200
'cause the son's down in Miami
with the discos and the whatnot.

210
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,400
He's grabbing
with both hands, John.

211
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,300
This could get ugly.

212
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,900
There's a lotta potential
for bloodshed.

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,700
Potential?
They almost killed us.

214
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Jason, men are
talking here.

215
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,200
Now you're
close to John.

216
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
- You have any ideas?
- What are you asking him for?

217
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,200
He never even had the makings
of a varsity athlete.

218
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,200
Your point being
what, Junior?

219
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,800
Oh, forget it,
he's just breaking balls.

220
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,500
All right,
one thought I had

221
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
in the interest
of harmony,

222
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,300
maybe there could be
a power-sharing situation.

223
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,700
The Sopranos
have two bosses.

224
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,200
That's not all it's cracked up to be,
believe you me.

225
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,000
Let's not get into that
right now, okay?

226
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,900
What I was thinking
was three bosses,

227
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,400
a triumvir-thing,
like Caesar.

228
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,900
- Little Carmine, Johnny and you.
- I'm retired.

229
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,300
You were Carmine's consigliere
for over 30 years.

230
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,900
If it wasn't for that construction beef
down in Yonkers

231
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,700
it'd be you running
that family today.

232
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,700
- Things happen how they happen.
- Think about it.

233
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,700
Doesn't have to be
9:00 to 5:00.

234
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,300
You could still take
your grandson to the park.

235
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,700
Things get heavy, you're just another
voice to weigh in.

236
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,100
And John still does
better financially

237
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,500
than he ever did
under Carmine.

238
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,600
There he is.
Salvatore, my Dali.

239
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
My aunt told me
about it.

240
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,100
I mean, what'd I ever
do to this guy?

241
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,800
They released
these fucks from the can.

242
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,300
Obviously,
he wasn't rehabilitated.

243
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,500
It's my livelihood.

244
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,800
I don't have a yard no more,
Sally, I'm in a condo.

245
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Otherwise, you know,
I'd have ya out there

246
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,100
with your snippers,
even with your bum wing.

247
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,600
My wife,
at this point...

248
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,100
she's got me thinking
about going to the cops.

249
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
What are you talking about?
Where are you from?

250
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,300
- I don't know what to do.
- You got friends, don't ya?

251
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,100
- I always steered clear of stuff.
- What stuff?

252
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
I go, I talk
to the guy for ya.

253
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,900
Get you back your stops.
I know him.

254
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,900
Yeah?

255
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,400
So you give me a token,
I don't know, couple percent.

256
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,100
Thanks, Paulie.

257
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
This one
and the next one.

258
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,200
There he is,
the king of breadsticks.

259
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,800
I'll give you a breadstick up your ass.
Come here, you.

260
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,800
Come on, sit down.

261
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,800
So, how's the kid,
huh, Tony?

262
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,600
He's good, you know.
But ask me,

263
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,100
he should've
stood with Carmela.

264
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,600
Some men need wives, huh?
Tell you when to shit

265
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,100
- and when to scratch your ass.
- Who needs them, huh?

266
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,600
What can I do
for you, Paul?

267
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,300
I got a guy, I think you
may have run into him,

268
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,100
gardener name
of Sal Vitro.

269
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,600
Does my aunt's grass.

270
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,500
He says your nephew's moving
into his neighborhood,

271
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,800
- Franklin Parkway.
- His neighborhood?

272
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,900
He's been working there
since back when I lived there.

273
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,700
Anyway, I'm here putting
in a word for the kid.

274
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,500
So do me a favor, huh?
You and your nephew over there, lay off.

275
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,200
- Hey, biscotti?
- No.

276
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,400
You know Mr. Jerry,

277
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,000
the fruit who owns
those hair salons, huh?

278
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,100
He came to me
the other day,

279
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,400
he asked me to take
his action on the Knicks.

280
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Jerry's my fucking customer,
for years now.

281
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,100
Which is why
I told him no.

282
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,700
This gardener, he cut the hair
on your balls, too?

283
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,300
He's a friend
of my Aunt Mary's.

284
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,300
Which is why he don't
belong to nobody.

285
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,000
What do you know about who belongs
to what? You been away 20 years!

286
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,200
- Which entitles me to earn!
- Which entitles you to shit.

287
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,000
In my book, you get points
for staying outta the can.

288
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,800
Good thing for me, then,
that your book don't mean oogatz to me!

289
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,200
What's yours
is yours, Paulie,

290
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,900
but what ain't
is anybody else's!

291
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,700
Now do yourself
a fucking favor

292
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,800
and get the fuck
outta my store!

293
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,800
So are we picking
Bobby up,

294
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,600
or is he gonna meet
us at Uncle Jun's?

295
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,500
He took the kids
to the 12:00 mass.

296
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I didn't know
he was religious.

297
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,700
At this point he'll try
anything, I guess.

298
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,400
Bobby Jr. started
wetting his bed again.

299
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,500
- Practically every night.
- Bobby came by to see me the other day.

300
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,000
Really?

301
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,200
So we discuss his career,
I'm his wife.

302
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,900
Sometimes he needs a push.

303
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,400
Junior's your uncle too, in case you
wanna play more of an active role...

304
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
I try, believe me.

305
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,900
Despite all the work
I have with my own family.

306
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,500
You know, I cook for Bobby
and the kids every night.

307
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
I did Sunday dinner
at my house,

308
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,400
and now I gotta
prepare the starters

309
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,600
and schlep 'em
to Uncle Jun's.

310
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,900
Yeah, Barb's helping out
all the way down from Brewster.

311
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,600
Barbara's kids are normal.

312
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,400
This family stuff,
these Sunday dinners,

313
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,300
they're important,
Janice.

314
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,200
Hey, Jan.
Julio?

315
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,700
- Help me get this order?
- Okay.

316
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,200
You know, every day I understand more
and more what Ma went through.

317
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,300
I mean we bitch about her,
but I tell you,

318
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,600
it is less and less a mystery
why she was the way she was.

319
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,300
- She chose to be that way.
- You don't choose that, Tony.

320
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,000
An ungrateful husband,
selfish kids.

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,900
- How's that food that Janice prepared?
- Two more minutes.

322
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,800
Artie's re-sautéing
the mushrooms.

323
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,700
Could I get you a glass of wine,
something to drink?

324
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,500
- No, I'm good.
- I'll have a pinot grigio.

325
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,700
20 minutes,
start the shells.

326
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,200
Just redoing the mushrooms,
two minutes tops.

327
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,700
Well relax, I just...

328
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,900
came in to say hello.

329
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,100
- So how you doing?
- Hanging in.

330
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,900
Heard you were over there
at the Motel 6.

331
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,900
My aunt took
the house back.

332
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,700
I'm moving in with my cousin
at the end of the month.

333
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,500
Look, if you want,
I'm staying over at my mother's

334
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,300
and the place is empty.
You can bunk with me for a while.

335
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,400
No. Thank you.

336
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,400
I was talking with
my cousin, Tony B,

337
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,000
and he said it's fucking stupid
that we're on the outs.

338
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,700
I'm telling ya, the place
is just sitting there,

339
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,300
two extra bedrooms.

340
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,900
- I don't know.
- Why not?

341
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,900
Artie, we're like brothers.

342
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,000
How long are we gonna
hold a grudge?

343
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,300
- Thanks, Ton'. Thank you very much.
- Yeah, all right.

344
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
All right.

345
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,500
Listen, I gotta talk to you
about your linens...

346
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,200
the napkins and tablecloths,
all that shit.

347
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,200
I got something going.
I think I can save you like 70%.

348
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,000
There's been a lot of
progress to the facade.

349
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,300
In some instances,
all of the paint comes off.

350
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,300
Now tell me, what
product is used...

351
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,800
I don't get these old antique houses.
They're grimy looking.

352
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,400
We gonna eat
today or what?

353
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Barbara and Tom aren't here yet
with the entrees, Uncle Jun'.

354
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,600
When were they
supposed to come?

355
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,800
2:00, I told you
five minutes ago. Here.

356
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,100
Why don't we start on the macaroni?
Everybody come on!

357
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,300
Bolognese has meat,
obviously, the marinara doesn't.

358
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,100
And Barb will be here with the chicken
parm and the veal pizzaiola.

359
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,800
So Anthony, how'd you guys do
against Delbarton last season?

360
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,200
- Not so good, we lost both times.
- It's that line coach.

361
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,600
"Star-Ledger" says Delbarton's gonna
be even tougher this coming year

362
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
- with that Chinese kid.
- Your father never had the makings

363
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,300
- of a varsity athlete.
- Oh, what the...?

364
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,900
- What the hell's with you?
- What?

365
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,700
It's not true.
I lettered in football.

366
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,400
- You never played college ball.
- College?

367
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,700
Those guys from Seton Hall
were seven feet tall some of them.

368
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,200
Took an academic
leave anyway.

369
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,800
Small hands,
that was your problem.

370
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,300
Oh yeah, Daddy
always said that.

371
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,900
That's not the point.

372
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
What is it with you and this obsession
with this varsity crap?

373
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,300
The other day
you said it.

374
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,700
When I was a kid you told the girl
cousins the same thing, it was hurtful.

375
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,100
- Tony, relax, it's not a big deal.
- It's undermining!

376
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,300
And it's the kinda stuff
I'm teaching my kids not to do.

377
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,100
So I don't wanna hear it again!
End of subject!

378
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,500
Honey, pass me
the ricotta, please.

379
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,100
Hello?

380
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,300
- In here! Hey!
- Hi, sorry we're late.

381
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,200
- The Tappan Zee was a nightmare.
- Checking the trucks again.

382
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,900
Well, sit down and dig into this medley
of pastas that Janice whipped up.

383
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,000
- How you doing, Uncle Jun'?
- I don't like tardiness.

384
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,600
- Let me unwrap these.
- This looks great.

385
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,300
- Thank you.
- So coming down I heard on the radio,

386
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,700
looks like the Jets are gonna grab
that kid from Tulsa, that tight end.

387
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,500
We still get those season tickets,
big brother?

388
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,400
He never had the makings
of a varsity athlete.

389
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,600
- Son of a bitch!
- What?

390
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,400
- Did I just tell you not to say that?!
- Say what?

391
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,200
You don't like the way
I talk, get outta my house!

392
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,400
- Here we go.
- Tony...

393
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,000
No "Tony" shit!
Get your coat, we're leaving.

394
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,600
- I don't have a coat.
- Well then get moving, God damn it!

395
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,200
Will someone please
tell me what's going on?

396
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,900
It's my last Sunday dinner here,
that's what's going on.

397
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,700
Uncle Jun', was that
really necessary?

398
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,900
He's a goddamn hothouse flower,
that's his problem.

399
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,300
Thank you for getting
my TV fixed, Paulie.

400
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,900
It's such a sin.
He fired his Spanish helper.

401
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,100
Took his boy outta college
'cause he couldn't afford it anymore.

402
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,100
He said it's his
last time coming here.

403
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,900
- You speak to the man?
- I'll see you later.

404
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,000
So what's up?

405
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,100
Nothing, I thought
we'd be first in line for opening day.

406
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,300
Peanuts are on me.

407
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,500
Angelo Garepe
came to see me.

408
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,600
- Mm-hmm.
- Lorraine Calluzzo reached out.

409
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,600
Fucking twat.
Didn't you fuck her once?

410
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,900
Yeah, a million years ago.

411
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,400
What, is nothing a secret?

412
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,800
Obviously you wanna
maintain stability,

413
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,200
but having Phil Leotardo
smack your shies around,

414
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,800
is that the smartest thing?

415
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,500
I gotta nip this Little Carmine shit
in the bud.

416
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,700
Otherwise I could see
a lot of people start fucking around.

417
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,000
Power vacuum,
the capos bide their time,

418
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,300
nobody's sure who to pay,
so nobody gets paid.

419
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,600
All right,
I hear you.

420
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,300
No one likes
that cunt anyway.

421
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,900
Any problem, she's "Whack
this one, whack that one".

422
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,800
Never enough body count
for Lorraine.

423
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,800
Fuck her, let her taste
her own medicine!

424
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,300
All right, whatever.

425
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,100
I'll tell you something else.
In large measure,

426
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
I blame you for this shit
with Little Carmine.

427
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,900
- What the fuck did I do?
- You legitimized him.

428
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,500
Man of your stature goes to Florida
to see that schmuck?

429
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,800
All right.
Come on, huh?

430
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,700
We both agree that little
Carmine's a fucking asshole,

431
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,300
but the fact is he's got a following
loyal to his old man.

432
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,300
So?

433
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,600
So, Angelo had an idea.

434
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,800
What if...

435
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,300
and he's just floating this
to keep the peace...

436
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,000
Mm-hmm.

437
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,200
What if there was
a power-sharing situation?

438
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,500
- Power sharing.
- You're all in charge equally,

439
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,400
but no major decisions
can be made without a majority of two.

440
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,900
What the fuck?

441
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,600
Hey, this way you're not such
a big target for the feds.

442
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,800
Three of the other families
have this kind of arrangement.

443
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,200
What's this,
the fucking U.N. now?!

444
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,300
- All right forget it! Forget I said it!
- Fuck that!

445
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,200
Everyone deserves
to choose how they feel,

446
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,700
to experience the love,
the joy, the happiness, the passion.

447
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,700
- Where's Junior?
- Upstairs taking a nap.

448
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,200
The garage is open,
his car is gone.

449
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,100
- Where is he?
- I'm telling you, I don't know.

450
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,900
You don't think somebody put
the snatch on him, do you?

451
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,300
When did you
see him last?

452
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,700
An hour ago. Two.

453
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,400
I fell asleep.
Maybe he drove to the store.

454
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,500
His wallet's here,
his watch.

455
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,500
With his bail, he's not allowed
to leave the house anyway.

456
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,200
Junior.

457
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,200
So when they say
they're not interested,

458
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,700
you say, "You're not interested
in keeping kids off drugs?"

459
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,600
What, Shabazz?

460
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,400
Nobody wants them
Turkish taffies.

461
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,300
You push harder.
What did I tell you about profit margin?

462
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,900
- Where's Johnny?
- We closed now.

463
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,700
- Let me talk to Damiano.
- We rented the hall today.

464
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,600
I'm looking for Johnny Soprano,
God damn it.

465
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Hey, this here's a church.

466
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,300
You can't talk
like that in here.

467
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,200
Get out, go on.
We're working here.

468
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,100
- I wanna see Johnny Soprano.
- Ain't no Johnny here.

469
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,000
- I'm his brother. He owns this place.
- Hold up, now.

470
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,900
Back in the day, this was
an Italian neighborhood.

471
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Some fellas
had this place here.

472
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,100
Kept those
vending machines.

473
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,600
Well, there ain't no vending
machines here no more.

474
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,600
Come on, fool, go on.

475
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,900
All right,
Roberta, thanks.

476
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,300
I'm sorry
to bother you.

477
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,700
Bobbi Sanfillipo?

478
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,000
Junior hasn't kept time
with her in years.

479
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,400
- Yeah, I realize that.
- You know, now that I think about it,

480
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,900
Junior was acting a little peculiar
when I got here today.

481
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,900
Said he wanted
to see Johnny.

482
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,100
What Johnny?

483
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,500
- His brother?
- I don't know.

484
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,700
Also there the other day,
we were watching the TV,

485
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,100
he thought he saw himself
on one of the programs.

486
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,800
We have got
the dishwashing liquid...

487
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,400
concentrated
dishwashing liquid.

488
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,700
No gloves, it's all-natural,
no chemicals.

489
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,300
- Hello?
- It's me.

490
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,100
- Did you drop off the drycleaning?
- Your uncle's missing.

491
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,500
He took his car.
He didn't call you, did he?

492
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,100
- No.
- Where the hell is he?

493
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,300
He's like an old woman.
He's probably gossiping with a neighbor.

494
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,500
Did you check
the Ramirez's next door?

495
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,400
I'm afraid he
might've wandered.

496
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,300
My grandfather did this.

497
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,600
Maybe you better
call Tony.

498
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,800
I can't just
dump this on Tony.

499
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,500
I gotta find him.

500
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,600
I need you to come here
in case he comes back.

501
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,100
- Bobby, I just can't...
- I need your help here! Jesus Christ!

502
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,600
Sometimes I think I love
Junior more than you do!

503
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,500
We may know that there are
five essentials for victory:

504
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,800
One, he will win
who knows when to fight

505
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,000
and when not to fight;

506
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,300
Two, he will win
who knows how to...

507
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,200
- You Gary?
- I'm Jimmy.

508
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
Gary's up there.

509
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,300
Hey, come down here!

510
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,000
- What?
- I said get down here!

511
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,200
I wanna talk to you!

512
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,500
- What do you want?
- I'm a friend of Sal Vitro's.

513
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
My aunt lives
on this street.

514
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,900
So?

515
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,000
So I'm guessing Sal Vitro
used to do this yard.

516
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,700
- A lotta things used to be.
- Maybe so,

517
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,200
but you're gonna make good
on his busted arm.

518
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,100
Oh yeah? Why am I
gonna do that?

519
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,300
'Cause I said so,
that's why.

520
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,700
- Eat shit, pal.
- Why don't you take a walk, huh?

521
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,700
Give me your wallet,
you prick.

522
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,400
This and the mower's
a down payment.

523
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,400
By next Tuesday I want Sal Vitro's
whole orthopedist bill paid.

524
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,500
Let's call it $1,200.

525
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,800
On top of that,
from now on I get 10%

526
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,500
of whatever you make
in this neighborhood.

527
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,000
- You motherfucker!
- Shut up or I'll give you a crack.

528
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,500
- Time is it?
- Don't worry, we'll take the tunnel.

529
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,700
All right,
this meeting today,

530
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,000
we're trying to nail down a new
contractor now with Massarone gone.

531
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,900
- That office park by Troy Hills?
- Listen...

532
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,000
and this is
very important...

533
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
if any of this shit
with Little Carmine

534
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and Johnny
comes up, you clam up.

535
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,700
- You got it, Ton'.
- Say nothing.

536
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,700
'Cause you say
the wrong thing...

537
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,300
- What?
- Tony, it's me.

538
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,900
Listen, it's your uncle.
He's gone.

539
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,400
- You mean he's dead?
- No, no, no, no.

540
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,300
We think he might've
wandered off.

541
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,300
You know, I didn't
wanna call you

542
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,700
- but it's been a couple hours now.
- Fuck him.

543
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,700
He said he was
going to see Johnny.

544
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,400
You think he might've
meant your dad?

545
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,900
- What?
- He's wandering, Ton'.

546
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,100
He can wander off
the Palisades for all I care.

547
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
He's fucking dead to me.

548
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,600
I called you
almost an hour ago.

549
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,300
- Where the hell have you been?
- Hello?

550
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,000
I was picking up
your daughter.

551
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,700
Stay here,
I'm going out.

552
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,500
Where the hell
is Tommy?

553
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
- I sent him home.
- Oh, wonderful.

554
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,400
He gets the day off,
and I get to wait by the phone.

555
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,600
- It's because of him Junior escaped.
- Dad, can I go with you?

556
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,000
- No.
- Can Janice go and we can stay here?

557
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,900
What'd I tell you
about being impolite?

558
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,300
If anyone cares, I'll be
upstairs lying down.

559
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,800
One hour of television,
then you both finish your homework.

560
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,600
And you, lay off
the Snapple.

561
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,900
What galls me is that before
Little Carmine went to Florida,

562
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,900
I was actually close with him.
I was in his wedding party.

563
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,200
Organized his whole
fucking bachelor party...

564
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,300
lesbian show, whores...
fucking disgusting.

565
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,800
Then when they had that kid
with the lung problem,

566
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,100
who you think got him that
doctor on Park Avenue?

567
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,000
Water over
the dam, huh?

568
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,900
I had no idea you guys
were that close.

569
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,200
Close? We were
like brothers.

570
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,000
It's a shame that you can't find
a way to work things out.

571
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,600
Give me piece
of bread, huh?

572
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,700
Have you thought
about this?

573
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,600
Maybe you let him
keep Lorraine,

574
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,400
and you take a bigger
piece of his Florida shit, the clubs.

575
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,700
If I wanted to worry
about Florida,

576
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,700
I would move
to fucking Miami.

577
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
You know, it wasn't
long ago I remember

578
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,500
you used to wait
in the car.

579
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,200
And as far as I'm concerned
you should still be there!

580
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,200
- He was just trying...
- Fuck "he was just!"

581
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,500
Everybody's got
a goddamn opinion!

582
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,700
I didn't say
nothing, Ton'.

583
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,100
- What the fuck did I say?!
- I'm sorry, T, I just...

584
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,300
Now I gotta un-fuck
what you just fucked up.

585
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,500
Gotta do something nice for Johnny.
Like what?

586
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,700
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?!

587
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,400
You gotta understand, this shit between
Johnny and Little Carmine is bad.

588
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,600
The instability.
But worse comes to worst,

589
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,700
it could work
to our advantage.

590
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,300
- How?
- They fight,

591
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,900
we pick up any crumbs
from the fallout.

592
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,600
The odds are that Johnny'll end up
on top, but who knows?

593
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,000
So keep your ears open
and your mouth shut!

594
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,300
Apparently, there's
a new president

595
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,800
at the electrician's union.

596
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,300
Tony sent Chrissy over
there to talk to him.

597
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,200
Something I've always been
meaning to get straight...

598
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,800
Tony calls Christopher
his nephew,

599
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,500
yet sometimes
you refer to them

600
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,800
as cousins.

601
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,300
Yeah, right.
See, Chrissy's not Tony's nephew.

602
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,100
Chrissy's Carmela's cousin.

603
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,400
She was first cousin
to Dickie Moltisanti, Chrissy's dad.

604
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,600
But he was always kinda like
a big brother to Tony, Dickie.

605
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,200
So Tony calls
Chrissy his nephew.

606
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,300
- It's an Italian thing.
- Okay.

607
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,900
Although technically,
Tony and Chrissy are cousins.

608
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,000
Joanne Blundetto,
Chrissy's mom,

609
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,600
is Tony's cousin
on his mother's side?

610
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,400
But, like way back.

611
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,100
Like from the old country
or something.

612
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,700
- Robyn?
- What?

613
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,400
How much longer am I gonna
have to keep doing this?

614
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,300
Major RICO against
Tony Soprano?

615
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,700
Those things take
years to build.

616
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,100
This recent case against
Joe Massino in New York?

617
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,100
It was seven years before
indictments were handed down.

618
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Hello, handsome.

619
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,000
Where you living now?
Around here?

620
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,300
- Do you know me?
- Do I know you?

621
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,100
Jupiter Club
on 6th Street?

622
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,000
Caught fire,
that place.

623
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,900
Lot of people died.

624
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,400
Do you know
my brother, Johnny?

625
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,100
You got all the looks,
I'll tell ya that.

626
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,000
What are you saying?

627
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,600
You and I
had relations?

628
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,400
Son of a bitch
in a taxicab,

629
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,500
run me right
over my foot.

630
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,900
- I have a car.
- Want a date?

631
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,600
I'll give you half and half
in the back seat.

632
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,000
- I want to go home.
- Let me get a ride by the shelter.

633
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,200
I have to find my car.

634
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,400
How you doing?

635
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,600
I don't gotta
tell you shit.

636
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,200
See some ID, sir?

637
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,300
Fuck you, copper,
I know my rights.

638
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,300
Hey, take
it easy now.

639
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,100
My car was stolen.
I want my lawyer.

640
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,200
- What's his name?
- Mel.

641
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,000
Okay, Mel what?

642
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,500
I see you went out
and forgot your shoes.

643
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,100
- Where do you live?
- Belleville.

644
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,000
Sure you don't want
to tell me your name?

645
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,500
- You're not in any trouble or anything.
- Corrado Soprano.

646
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
Tell you what, sir,

647
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,500
why don't you come and get in the car
where it's nice and warm?

648
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
We'll try to figure out
how to get in touch

649
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,300
with your lawyer,
all right?

650
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,000
Jesus, Uncle Jun',
thank God.

651
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,400
- This gentleman reside here, ma'am?
- He's my uncle.

652
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,000
Where have you been?
We were worried sick.

653
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,200
I'll need to see some
identification, ma'am.

654
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,800
- Oh, okay, I'll get my bag.
- His, actually.

655
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,600
Bobby, get
Uncle Jun's wallet.

656
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,700
It's upstairs
on his dresser.

657
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,100
Uncle Jun',
you're freezing.

658
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,300
We found him walking across
Clay Street Bridge in Newark.

659
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,400
Newark?

660
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,500
- Where's your car?
- They stole it.

661
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,700
- Who stole it?
- You know who.

662
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,200
It's him.
Junior Soprano.

663
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,100
- Here ya go, sir.
- Go shit in your hat.

664
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,500
Uncle Jun', stop.
Thank you, officers.

665
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,400
Thank you.

666
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,100
Uncle Jun',
did you tell Tommy

667
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,500
- you were going to see my father?
- Of course not.

668
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,100
What are you doing?
Sit!

669
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,600
- I have to use the facilities.
- Bobby, go with him.

670
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,400
God damn it,
I can piss by myself!

671
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,400
Okay, okay.

672
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,500
- I'll open some soup.
- You go out for some exercise,

673
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,700
people give you
the goddamn third degree.

674
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,800
- Hi, Ellie.
- Oh, hello, Louie.

675
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,800
How's the big
slot-machine king?

676
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,700
Oh, I ain't doing that
no more, I'm retired.

677
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,300
Tony, it's me.

678
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,900
- What's the matter?
- It's Uncle Jun'.

679
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,700
They found him in Newark,
in his slippers.

680
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,200
He was looking
for Daddy, Tony.

681
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,200
He may have Alzheimer's.
I don't know.

682
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,000
Good, maybe he'll forget
my phone number.

683
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,600
Jesus Christ.

684
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,000
Mozzarella in carrozza.
Still warm.

685
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,100
Artie, we're in the middle
of a family meeting.

686
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,100
I'm not even here.

687
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,700
He's our uncle, Tony. There may be
something seriously wrong with him.

688
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,900
Listen, Janice,
like I told your husband,

689
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,300
- he's fucking dead to me.
- Are you that fragile?

690
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,600
You don't know the half
of it when it comes to us.

691
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,200
And if you're so concerned,
take him to the doctor.

692
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,100
- 'Cause I've had it.
- You're the only one he relates to.

693
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,100
We won't even be able
to get him in the car.

694
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,900
Fuck him.
You reap what you sow.

695
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,800
You sure did.
You think maybe there's a reason

696
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,400
you're living all alone
here without your family?

697
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,700
Whoa.
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

698
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,400
You're gonna give me
advice on marriage?

699
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,800
You know, Tony, there's a lot I can say
right now that I am not gonna say.

700
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,300
Fuck it! Say it! Say it!
Who gives a fuck?

701
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,500
Think I don't know what
you're doing here, Janice?

702
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,600
Trying to pawn
this shit off on me.

703
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,500
Your whole life... whenever
there's a family problem,

704
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,100
- you shirk your duties or run away!
- Ran away?

705
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,100
- Tibet or fucking Berkeley.
- I was 18 years old!

706
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,700
I was 16 when you left me with our
head case of a mother.

707
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,100
Who you all of a sudden
relate to so fucking well!

708
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,500
I was merely saying...

709
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,100
Free-spirit Janice,
rebel without a cause,

710
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
while I sit here
mired in her bullshit

711
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,000
trying to be a good son
while you're off dropping acid

712
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,100
- and blowing roadies!
- Roadies?

713
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,300
- Oh, you don't wanna know.
- That is not true, Tony.

714
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,000
Now you tell him that
that's not true!

715
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,100
Poor fucking Janice,
she's so depressed.

716
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,200
Poor Janice, she can't get up
off the couch

717
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,400
'cause she's so tired
from her Epstein-Barr.

718
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,700
Poor fucking Janice.
Va fongul!

719
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,200
- Why don't we calm down?
- Maybe you were the smart one

720
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,000
'cause you got outta here,
but your hippie string ran out

721
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
and now you're gonna do to this man
what you do to every one of 'em.

722
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
- Fucking piece of shit!
- You stupid cunt.

723
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,100
Oh, just like
your mother, huh?

724
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,400
Now you can do to him
what she did to Daddy!

725
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,800
Cocksucker!

726
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,700
You want more
responsibility?

727
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,600
Start with controlling
your wife.

728
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,000
And then from nowhere,
he cracks one kid's head with a shovel

729
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,900
and the other one,
he knocks out of a tree.

730
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,700
He jumped out of the tree and came
at me with a chainsaw.

731
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,500
I got a right
to defend myself, Ton'.

732
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,100
All right,
take it easy, relax.

733
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,000
Sal Vitro's been
working the area

734
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
since my ma was still
working at Kresge's.

735
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,000
I should be able to help out a kid
from my own neighborhood.

736
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,900
All right,
how about this?

737
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,800
Vitro and your nephew
split the area...

738
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,900
east of Dyer is yours,

739
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,800
west of Dyer goes to him.
As for the broken arm...

740
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,100
I don't know,
give him $500.

741
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,000
I already told
the guy 12, T.

742
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,100
Well there's fucking
compromises in life, Paulie.

743
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,000
All right, make it a grand
for the pain and suffering.

744
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,200
Naturally I want
my taste, retroactive,

745
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,900
'cause this is the first time
I heard about any of this.

746
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,800
It's a new venture.
My nephew's barely on his feet.

747
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,300
I mean, I didn't
want to start kicking up

748
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,400
and pull it back
if it don't work out.

749
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,600
And of course Vitro'll
do your grass too, Ton'.

750
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,800
No charge.

751
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,200
Remind me to talk
to you about that later.

752
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,100
There he is.
Salvatore, my boy.

753
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,400
- How's that pitching arm?
- It's getting there.

754
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,400
Paul, say hello
to Mr. Gaultieri.

755
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,400
That's my middle
name, Paul.

756
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,700
So I talked to that guy.
Good news.

757
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,600
I got you 500
for your arm,

758
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,900
and you keep
half your area.

759
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,400
- Half?
- It could've been nothing.

760
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,900
Lucky you know me.

761
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,700
West of Dyer's yours,
east belongs to him.

762
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,500
Paulie, my wife's
gonna sh...

763
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,300
All right,
thank you, Paulie.

764
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,300
Oh, one more thing.

765
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,000
You're gonna have to cut a couple
of lawns on the comp.

766
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,300
Some friends of ours.

767
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,400
Some shot, huh,
the way it hooked?

768
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,400
You got a fucking
horseshoe up your ass.

769
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,200
Mr. Soprano?

770
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:24,100
Harry Winer, I was
your mother's neurologist.

771
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,300
- I did her work-up from Green Grove?
- Yeah, how you doing?

772
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,300
So I assume your sister
told you I'm treating your uncle.

773
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,500
Oh yeah, yeah,
she mentioned it.

774
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,600
- Catch you in there, T.
- Yeah.

775
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,400
I think with the right meds
we can control these things.

776
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,000
- What things?
- The infarcts.

777
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,200
They're akin
to mini-strokes.

778
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,200
He suffered significant brain trauma
the other day. You probably noticed him

779
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,700
acting differently over the past six
months, a year maybe.

780
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,100
Well to tell you the truth, me and my
uncle, we don't talk much anymore.

781
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,000
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

782
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Don't be,
he's a hostile prick.

783
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,700
Well, unfortunately obstinacy
is consistent with his condition.

784
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,000
Impatience, forgetfulness,
particularly with short-term memory.

785
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,000
Do you find he'll ask the same question
every three minutes?

786
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,200
What time it is?

787
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,700
I don't know.
Maybe.

788
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,000
It's frustrating, I know.
Anyway, the last thing I wanted to do

789
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
was get in the middle
of a family squabble.

790
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,600
- I just wanted to say hello.
- Well, nice seeing you.

791
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,500
Okay.
All right.

792
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,700
Member of the squirrel
family,

793
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,700
the prairie dog makes
its home mainly...

794
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,600
Tommy?

795
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,800
Brought you some fish.
Trying to clean out my refrigerator.

796
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,200
Make sure you form a seal
when you shut that freezer door.

797
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,600
Of the two main species,
the black-tailed prairie dog

798
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,800
is much more widespread,
inhabiting much

799
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,000
of the Great Plains
and the Great Basin.

800
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,300
So how you feeling?

801
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,800
Heard you had
a little problem.

802
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,200
What problem?

803
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,600
All right.

804
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,500
But your doctor said
something different.

805
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,800
Who, Kennedy?

806
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,700
Kennedy's
your cancer doctor.

807
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,700
I knew that.

808
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,900
You said doctor.

809
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,000
The white-tailed prairie dog
lives at higher elevations,

810
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,700
hibernating
throughout the winter.

811
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,900
Just take your medicine,
Uncle Jun'.

812
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,900
Make you feel better.

813
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,300
Help with your memory.

814
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,100
Believe me, there's plenty
I'd like to forget.

815
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,400
Yeah, you and me both.

816
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:44,100
- Feech was here?
- Yeah, he came to pay his respects.

817
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,700
What's this I hear,
you ruled against Feech?

818
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,900
- He's an important man.
- Why is he bitching at you about shit?

819
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,200
I'm still the boss
of this family,

820
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,300
despite any arrangements.

821
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,500
Yellow in color,
they often have dark...

822
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,300
These prairie dogs,
they'll sleep during the day.

823
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,300
Oh yeah?

824
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,100
Look, the doctor
said you

825
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,100
might not have known
what you were saying.

826
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,100
What are you
talking about?

827
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,600
The varsity shit.

828
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,900
So, what else did Feech
have to say?

829
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,600
Getting a new top
on his convertible.

830
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:49,200
All right, let's assume that you
didn't know what you were saying.

831

834
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,500
Why can't you repeat
something good?

835
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,500
