00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,880
melinda: previously on ghost whisperer...

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,540
let's have a baby.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,980
oh,god,i love you.

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,800
you did conceive,but your body didn't support the pregnancy.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,100
you have to understand--you move between the world of life and death.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,130
sometimes you come back from one with a touch of the other.

7
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,090
a touch?

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,040
of death.

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,930
be careful.

10
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,130
it might brush off.

11
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,130
on what?

12
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,750
on what you touch.

13
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,210
well,what is this prescription?

14
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,220
it's for a hormone.

15
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,350
it helps the embryo attach itself.

16
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,740
basically makes it feel more at home so it can-

17
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,280
-and this is all we need?

18
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,530
yeah.

19
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,760
so we're gonna be able to have a baby?

20
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,340
really?

21
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,330
i can't believe you worked on wall street.

22
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,140
neither can i.

23
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,130
uh,i told you that.

24
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,650
no,you told me he hates suits.

25
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,190
i told you he hated being a suit.

26
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,020
a suit who is on his way to a corner office.

27
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,980
-what can i say?
-well,i gotta tell you,

28
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,260
i'm glad i'm finally getting a chanceto meet the legendary jim clancy.

29
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,710
he's heard a lot about you.

30
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,750
you can hear a lot about somebody

31
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,620
when they've worked 80 hour weeks together.

32
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,300
so listen,jim,you don't missthe anxiety

33
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,820
and the tensionof tearing open that journal the moment you wake up,huh?

34
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,250

35
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,230
what i'm looking forward tois seeing your wedding announcementin this sunday's times.

36
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,630

37

39
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,070

40
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,250
a million squared.

41
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,200

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,400

a ballerina.

48
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,840
a beautiful ballerina.

49

well,i mean,the house has been locked down and closedfor a few months now.

121
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,600
it might be rustic to you,but i think it's a little rickety.

122
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,490
i don't think we should be in here.

123
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,890
this is hunter's room.

124
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,390

00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,310
what was he like?

184
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,600
natalie's dad?

185
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,030
ah,he was a little bit like hunter.

186
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,630
you know,kinda low-key but friendly.

187
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,600
you know,they'd been together since college.

188
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,360
so they spent some time here.

189
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,920
probably...

190
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,520
what?

191
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,150
just must be hard for him to let go.

192
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,820
before the ant thing,i heard natalie talking to somebody--

193
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,380
right,to her imaginary friend,huh?

194
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,040
yeah,the friend was whispering back.

195
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,150
oh,no.

196
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,860
you know,little kids can see spirits.

197
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,420
she's still young enough.

198
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,480
and you think it's tricia's first husband?

199
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,080
he died,she's getting remarried.

200
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,050
how would you feel?

201
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,910
probably about as mad as a mob of red ants.

202
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,460
hey,melinda.

203
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,450
meet another guest.

204
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,350
this is christopher murray,an old friend of hunter's.

205
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,720
-hi,nice to meet you.
-nice to meet you.

206
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,650
and you know my mom,of course,margaret.

207
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,910
yeah,well,you know,she rescued me on one of her morning walks.

208
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,240
it's not that easy to find this place.

209
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,770
well,we're obviously glad you did.

210
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,090
so why don't we get you settled.

211
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,220
sure.

212
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,610
oh,yeah,this,uh,a little something for the groom.

213
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,540
isn't that thoughtful?

214
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,140
christopher and hunter have known each other since they were 15.

215
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,020
now they're opening a restaurant together.

216
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,680
it's a place i invested in in dallas i told you about.

217
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,390
oh,yeah.

218
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,430
i'm sure it's hard to keep it all straight with this mogul.

219
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,920
one second we're slinging around rich guys' golf clubs

220
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,220
and the nextecond,he is the rich guy.

221
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,240
hold on a second.

222
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,080
i mean,you were the one who actually came up with the ideafor the restaurant in the first place,not me.

223
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,850
opening one was my idea,but everything else was yours.

224
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,970
the concept,the name.

225
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,950
what is the name?

226
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,560
axiom steakhouse.

227
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,170
hmmyou'll have to ask the genius what that means.

228
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,550
ah,come on,i can't brag about my old friend?

229
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,190
no,no,keep braggin'.

230
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,190
no problem.just save some for the toast.

231
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,900
let's get you a room,shall we?

232
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,500
see you later,darling.

233
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,110
bye,melinda.

234
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,880
i'm so glad that one of his friends took initiative.

235
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,800
hunter's not in touch with his family,and most of his friends are from work.

236
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,930
he won't admit it,but i think he kept his list shortso it wouldn't be too much about him.

237
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,030
where is she going?

238
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,910
you know,i take my eyes off her for one minute...

239
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,770
it's so unlike her,wandering off like that.

240
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,740
you know what,i can go check if you want,'cause i'm going out for a run,anyway.

241
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,060
you sure?

242
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,590
thanks.

243
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,430
natalie?

244
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,190
natalie?

245
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,090
it's pretty down here,huh?

246
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,240
you know,they had a stream like this where i grew up,too.

247
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,630
did your friend bring you out here?

248
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,080
it's ok if he did.

249
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,410
i know that most grown-ups don't believe in imaginary friends,but i do.

250
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,830
is he here with you right now?

251
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,140
he doesn't like to be around peoplebecause he's really sick.

252
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,740
ok,well,that's hard.

253
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,670
you know,your mom told me that your dad was really sick,

254
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,060
do you think maybe that's why he's being so shy--

255
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,930
i don't want to talk about this anymore.

256
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,800
ok,i'm sorry.

257
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,340
do you mind if i talk to him?

258
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,540
no!

259
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,730
i don't want you to and neither does he.

260
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,400
why not?

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,670
because he's mad.

262
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,810
he's really mad.

263
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,280
mommy,mommy!

264
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,100
well,hello,princess!

265
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,240
you have to come with me.

266
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,590
he wants you to see something.

267
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,800
who,your friend?

268
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,870
you know what,baby,i can't play right now.

269
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,980
the rehearsal dinner's about to begin.

270
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,220
mommy,he says it's important.

271
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,080
he says you have to come now.

272
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,400
please,please,please?

273
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,380
ok,but listen,it has to be quick.

274
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,380
-quick,quick.
-come on,let's go.

275
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,310
all right!

276
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,510
he wants us to follow him!

277
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,780
nat...

278
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,350
ok,what you want to show me?

279
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,030
did you do that?

280
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,390
that means he wants you to look inside.

281
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,420
that's the game.

282
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,970
right,the game.

283
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,740
ok.

284
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,820
mommy!

285
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,290
who put an ice pick in the linen drawer?

286
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,390
did you put that in there?

287
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,450
no!

288
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,860
i don't know why he did that to you.

289
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,880
natalie,you know what?

290
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,050
stop.

291
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,610
stop with the imaginary friend.

292
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,390
no more games,not like these.

293
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,320
sweetie...

294
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,920
i love you.

295
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,390
i love you so much,and nothing is going to change that.

296
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,610
but i'm getting married tomorrow.

297
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,840
no matter what.

298
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,250
do you understand?

299
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,040
natalie?

300
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,240
can i come in?

301
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,040
i heard about what happened to your mom.

302
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,880
it must have been really scary.

303
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,920
i don't know why he's being so mean to her.

304
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,290
what are you drawing?

305
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,830
that's me and mommy catching butterflies.

306
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,190
it's lovely.

307
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,860
what are the other ones?

308
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,270
that's owen.

309
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,850
owen?

310
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,330
is that your friend?

311
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,120
he's a little boy.

312
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,400
are those leg braces?

313
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,140
is that what you meant when you said he was sick?

314
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,890
why does he look so sad?

315
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,910
because he says something very bad is going to happen.

316
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,310
i-i don't mean to be dense,but i don't understand why you're asking me.

317
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,690
why would i know this boy?

318
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,390
he's not even real.

319
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:21,830
sometimes kids will model imaginary friendsafter real people that they've met.

320
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,190
so did nat ever see anyone maybe with leg braces?

321
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,510
you know,it could have been from a while ago.

322
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,950
maybe in the hospital when jeremy was sick?

323
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,940
i have never seen nat with this boyat the hospital or anywhere.

324
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,890
but i gotta say,i'm really proud of you,honey.

325
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,770
i mean,my gosh...

326
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,590
look at how creative you are--

327
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,960
owen's real.

328
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,710
of course.

329
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,040
in your mind,of course.

330
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,410
mommy,i didn't make him up.

331
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,320
well,let's take a look at these pictures.

332
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,140
someone decided to give him a red shirt and blue pants--

333
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,520
but i didn't draw those.

334
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,840
i just drew this one.

335
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,630
wait,that one's in marker.

336
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,620
those are in crayon.

337
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,380
we don't have any crayons here.

338
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,780
i know those drawings.

339
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,680
don't you?

340
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,950
why would i,mom?

341
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,240
you drew them.

342
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,650
there was a game you played that summer.

343
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,090
a strange little game.

344
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,600
with these drawings?

345
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,160
with your made up friend.

346
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,510
my made up friend?

347
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,710
what was the game?

348
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,180
it was sort of a word game,with a treasure hunt mixed in.

349
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,100
you'd hide objects around,and they spelled out words somehow.

350
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,320
wait,wait,i-- i seem to remember this,

351
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,050
but it's a game that you showed me,mom.

352
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,720
you showed me how to play.

353
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,950
you took the first letterof each hidden thingand put it together,right?

354
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,050
no,sweetheart,i remember distinctly.

355
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:46,230
i used to think,goodness,my tricia's working awfully hardfor me to believe--

356
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,790
owen did it!

357
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,420
he hid the clues.

358
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,530
he still does.

359
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,730
ok,nat.honey,look--

360
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,520
you know what,tricia,why don't you and i go and take a walk?

361
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,040
am i supposed to believei just conveniently forgot all this?

362
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,720
that i used to see ghosts,including a boy ghost i used to play with?

363
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,540
all children believe in thingsthey stop believing in as adults.

364
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:14,420
memories fade,and people have no room for it next to their logic and reason.

365
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,570
but you do.

366
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,350
well,i don't have a choice.

367
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,620
ok.

368
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,820
so let's say this owen is real.

369
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,620
what now?

370
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,200
we have to find out what he wants from you.

371
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,510
other than wrecking my wedding?

372
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,130
well,we're ok in one way--at least he wants to talk to you.

373
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,360
now we just have to get him to cut to the chase,which is why i brought you here.

374
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,700
here?

375
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,860
is his voice in the babbling brook?

376
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,710
does he use a tree phone?

377
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,350
i remember my wedding day,too.

378
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,600
i was also a little on edge.

379
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,620
i'm sorry,i don't mean to be disrespectful.

380
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,700
it's just,i'm so stressed out--

381
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,520
he's here.

382
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,160
where?

383
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,420
he's a little shy,so he doesn't liketo stay in one place at a time--

384
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,390
owen.hi.

385
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,090
i'm melinda.

386
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,180
look,i came here to tell youthat tricia,

387
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,460
she is not having fun playing your game--

388
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,650
she's not supposed to.

389
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,360
are you talking to him right now?

390
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,520
whatever it is you want her to know,just tell her.

391
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,410
no.

392
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,160
ok,you don't understand.

393
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,740
she doesn't have time to play your gamebecause she's getting married today.

394
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,610
look,since the two of you can talk to each other,

395
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,190
why doesn't he just play the game with you?

396
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,890
no!

397
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,920
what was that?

398
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,410
she has to play.

399
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,020
tell her if she doesn't,she'll be sorry.

400
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,790
tell her!

401
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,980
he says that you have to play.

402
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,880
you're the only one.

403
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,190
you know what?

404
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,590
i know you're trying to help,but i walk down the aisle in 6 hours,and,

405
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,490
uh,this is,uh,this is just too much for me.

406
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,840
i'll see you back at the lodge.

407
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,660
trish,honey,everyone's getting together outsidefor some candids before the ceremony.

408
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,380
are you still obsessing over that seating chart?

409
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,980
if i could think,i'd be done already.

410
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,790
just tell them i'll be down in about 10 minutes.

411
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,000
i'd better tell them 20.

412
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,010
mom,seriously,if you don't stop...

413
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,410
ok,fine.

414
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,930
let's play.

415
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,300
what am i scared of?

416
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,640
any luck?

417
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,370
sure would help if i had more than a first name.

418
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,720
you tried cross referencing the lodge nameor the street name...

419
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,870
yeah,sorry.

420
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,350
of course you have.

421
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,580
it's just trish is an old friend.

422
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,950
i'm a little worried about her.

423
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,430
you and me both.

424
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,680
if we don't get a handle on this ghost soon...

425
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,210
i know,don't say it.

426
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,250
you guys seen trish?

427
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,540
she was supposed to be down here to take some pictures.

428
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,230
oh,she's upstairs obsessing over the seating chart.

429
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,110
um,i'm gonna go,uh,track trish down.

430
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,620
bob.

431
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,030
who's bob?

432
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,940
what is this,apples?

433
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,450
you want me to bob for apples?

434
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,940
good for you.

435
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,000
well,she's not in her room.

436
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,980
i'm sure she'll be here any second,it's just--

437
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,450
well,we can both help you look.

438
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,150
*************

439
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,090
paah,just get it off!just get it off!

440
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,310
it's off,it's off.

441
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,630
sweetie,it's off.listen to me,hey.i got it off,ok?

442
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,750
it's the last one.it's the last one,i swear.

443
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,680
why is he doing this?

444
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,220
i just want this to end!

445
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,430
well,it's gotta be a message.

446
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,490
we just have to figure out--

447
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,790
no,we don't,ok?please save it.

448
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,260
can't you see she's been through enough?

449
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,290
look,i know you guys are trying to help,

450
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,080
and you're old friends and we appreciate it.

451
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,600
but the last thing trisha needs to hear about right now is ghosts.ok?

452
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,860
so please.

453
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,110
it's ok.

454
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,220
let's face it,we all have the same thing on our minds,even nat.

455
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,110
and i'm sure i'd miss jeremy too,if i knew him,but i don't,so--

456
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,680
we get it,ok?

457
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,850
just take care of your fiancee.

458
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,840
the game is leading to something,some answer.

459
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,630
there's something he wants her to know.

460
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,580
natalie said you take the first letterfrom every word,right?

461
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,640
right,so far we have ants,ice pick,and leeches.

462
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,830
a-i-l.ail?

463
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,130
what does that mean?

464
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,350
ailment?

465
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,170
i mean,natalie said owen was sick,right?

466
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,620
so maybe the subject of the message is ailment.

467
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,480
yeah,but what disease would he havewhere he'd have to wear leg braces?

468
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,060
polio,but only if he died a long time ago.

469
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,450
well,the lodge has been in tricia's family for generations.

470
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,470
um,there's hemiplegia.

471
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,760
muscular dystrophy--

472
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,010
ooh,wait.

473
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,040
that might be what i need to get his name.

474
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,300
there you go.

475
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,300
the owen grace muscular dystrophy foundation.

476
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,220
hit the mission statement.

477
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,090
"founded in 1981 by the grace family

478
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:39,050
in honor of their son,owen,who died...

479
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,660
but he didn't die of the disease.

480
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,870
he drowned in morton creek.

481
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,830
which is here,right on the property.

482
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,810
and where natalie was playing.

483
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,860
and probably tricia,too.

484
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,890
wait,you don't think maybe she had something to do with his death?

485
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,680
owen?

486
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,860
owen.

487
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,660
we need to talk.

488
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,820
look,i know what happened.

489
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,150
i know that you drowned here.

490
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,510
i can help you,ok,but you need to talk to me.

491
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,930
trish is done playing your game.

492
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,460
she can't be.

493
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,530
it's not over yet.

494
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,370
people don't want to play games that hurt them.

495
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,050
hurt tricia?

496
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,470
i'm trying to help her.

497
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,470
with ants and ice picks and leeches?

498
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,780
she hates that stuff!

499
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,630
exactly.

500
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,510
but that's a clue,too!

501
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,040
what does that mean?

502
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,370
what is a clue?

503
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,290
no,i'm not telling you.

504
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,890
it's our game,she has to figure it out.

505
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,840
not you.

506
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,060
ok...

507
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,340
owen,what if i get her to keep playing?

508
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,540
then will you tell me what happened?

509
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,990
that is my best deal,ok.

510
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,660
you have to tell me what happened here.

511
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,510
this is where i first met her.

512
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,930
wait up!

513
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,090
wait up!

514
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,950
but they wouldn't.

515
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,080
i'll be right back.wait there.

516
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,790
tricia came back with a pie of rope.

517
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,090
there.now you can cross.

518
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,120
careful!

519
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,390
we went back to her house and played till dark.

520
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,640
the next day i came back to see her again.

521
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,940
only she wasn't there...

522
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,720
but they were.

523
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,510
trish?

524
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,720
tricia!

525
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,150
tricia didn't come.

526
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,880
i thought maybe she was already on the other side.

527
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,650
and i really wanted to play.

528
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,630
so that's why you're still here?

529
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,750
because you blame her for what happened?

530
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,920
no.

531
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,400
i just told you,she wasn't even here.

532
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,910
i wanted to see her,so i waited.

533
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,000
that's all.

534
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,750
and you've been waiting here ever since?

535
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,980
i knew she'd come back...

536
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,300
i just didn't know she'd be in trouble.

537
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,850
what kind of trouble?

538
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,550
it's a grown-up secret.

539
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,840
she wouldn't want anyone else to know.

540
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,370
i gave her the clues.

541
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,910
well,whatever it is that you gave her,it's not enough.

542
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,040
yes,it is.

543
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,220
she just missed a few.

544
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,310
tell trish to keep playing.

545
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,720
i'm not suggesting that we look for more clues,

546
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,220
but if you could at least look at what we have--

547
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:00,940
no.

548
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,910
tricia,i understand.

549
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,060
no,i don't think you do,melinda.

550
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,120
this is my wedding day.

551
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,830
look what i found a few minutes agoin what would have been my wedding bed.

552
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,850
it's a rope.

553
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,640
the same onethat you helped owen cross the creek with.

554
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,860
rope,that's an "r," right?

555
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,240
ok,and we've got an a-i-l.

556
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,210
what is that,rail?

557
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,970
or liar.

558
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,100
that would describe the ghostfor ever letting me think this would be over.

559
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,910
he said that you have all the clues that you need,

560
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,520
you just haven't figured them out yet.

561
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,840
what does that mean?

562
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
that we're almost there.

563
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,600
let's just finish this,ok?

564
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,620
once and for all.

565
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,800
yeah,i saw those in there before.

566
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,220
who do they belong to?

567
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,590
it said "bob" in the mirror.

568
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,750
i--wait...

569
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,380
bob could mean--

570
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,970
short for robert.rgl.

571
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,460
natalie said that owen led her here.

572
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,800
maybe there's something we missed.

573
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,460
not unless it's hunter's boxers.

574
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,900
or this.

575
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,620
a gift for the groom from your old friend chris.

576
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,760
what is this?

577
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,970
it's hunter and christopher from 12 years ago.

578
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,480
trish,can i...

579
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,350
robert langowski.

580
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,440
oh,wait.

581
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,320
rgl?

582
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,180
bob?

583
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,140
the liar...

584
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,410
it's hunter.

585
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,690
what's keeping her?

586
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:03,400
there must be a dozen checksmade out to christopher for way morethan we agreed on.

587
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,840
goes,what does all of this mean?

588
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,850
whatever it is,i think owen was protecting you.

589
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,910
from hunter?

590
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,620
from robert langowski.

591
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,140
the restaurant in dallas,axiom steakhouse?

592
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,060
it doesn't even exist.

593
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,080
christopher was blackmailing him.

594
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,980
threatening to out him...

595
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,610
the way he hid the present,the lies--

596
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,380
yeah,i think there's more.

597
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,450
i just got off the phone with one of my police friends.

598
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:36,090
no one under the name hunter claytonor robert langowski ever went to the harvard business school.

599
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,370
i'm sorry,trish.

600
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,830
ireland,of course.

601
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,730
trica's always wanted to go there,so for our honeymoon--

602
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,860
robert langowski!

603
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,110
honey,come on.

604
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,830
-i found it,the picture of you and christopher.
-excuse us.

605
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,690
-honey,what are you doing?
-don't touch me!

606
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,150
-you're not supposed to be down here yet.
-everything...

607
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,220
none of it was real.

608
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,980
************

609
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,930
tricia£¬sweetheart.

610
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,060
tricia,darling,what's wrong?

611
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,760
owen?

612
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,840
you did it.

613
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,680
tricia knows the truth.

614
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,890
the game is over.

615
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,730
you saved her from marrying hunter.

616
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:23,090
isn't that-- isn't that what you wanted?

617
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,510
owen?

618
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,360
jim: maybe he crossed over.

619
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,100
melinda: i don't think so.

620
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,990
did everybody leave?

621
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,320
oh,people cleared out of there like the place was on fire.

622
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,940
trish and her mom are packing tonightto drive down to the city.

623
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,180
maybe we can check in on them this weekend,go down.

624
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,950
so,help me out here.

625
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,890
are your ghosts all-knowing now?

626
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,610
i mean,how did owen know the truth?

627
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,860
well,hunter was at the lodge for a few days,you know,

628
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,240
setting things up before the wedding.

629
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,080
owen probably overheard something.

630
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,320
and they're not "my ghosts.

631
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,690
"sorry.

632
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,550
did detective neely say what was going to happen to hunter

633
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,370
or bob or whoever the heck he is?

634
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,700
well,there's no law lying about your background.

635
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,490
but finance is all about trust,so his career is over.

636
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,820
marriage is about trust,too.

637
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,490
all right,one more trip,we should be done.

638
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,280
you want me to go with you?

639
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,070
uh,no.

640
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:18,860
um,why don't you stay here,you know,get everything done.

641
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,820
and then that'll give us time to come home early,right?

642
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,110
oh,right.

643
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,850
yeah,ok.

644
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,630
so i'll see you there.

645
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,980
all right.

646
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,380
owen?

647
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,090
owen?

648
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,490
where have you been?what's wrong?

649
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,480
i tried to fix everything for her.

650
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,320
and you did.

651
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,660
she's safe now.

652
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,000
hunter's gone.

653
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,540
he's still at the lodge.

654
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,030
he is?'cause--

655
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,560
i mean,i'm sure he's gonna leave soon.

656
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,040
there's no reason for him to stay there now.

657
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,910
same goes for you.

658
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,610
i think you're wrong.

659
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,830
he's really mad.

660
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,420
and he's acting weird.

661
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,720
acting weird how?

662
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,870
i don't want anyone else to get hurt.

663
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,460
especially not you.

664
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,190
Melinda calling

665
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,080
you've reached jim.

666
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,200
if this is an emergency,chances are,i'm already on my--

667
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,820
forget it.

668
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,530
detective neely.

669
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,060
hey,detective neely,yeah,it's melinda.

670
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,260
hey,melinda.what's up?

671
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,020
um,listen,hunter is still at the lodge.

672
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,290
and jim,he's up there...

673
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,270
is everything ok?

674
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,410
he's not answering his cell.

675
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,530
i'm kind of freaking out.

676
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,420
i can't really explain it.

677
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,820
can you just meet me there?

678
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,990
yeah,i'm on my way.

679
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,230
thanks.

680
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,550
hello?

681
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,970
is somebody here?

682
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,740
is somebody here?

683
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,970
what are you doing?

684
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,610
i'm waiting.

685
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,190
well,she's not coming back.

686
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,120
you know,let me ask you something,jim.

687
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:55,650
you think that ghostwaited his whole life to be with someone like her?

688
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,480
you need to leave.

689
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,100
his whole life?

690
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,710
that's right,i forgot,he's a ghost.

691
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,380
his whole life.

692
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,780
he's dead.

693
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,670
look,come on.

694
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,010
-listen to me--
-come to think of it...

695
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,700
so am i.

696
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,850
right.

697
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,600
you know,i grew up by a lake just like this one,jim.

698
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,910
when i was a kid,i used to sit on the beachand i had to watch the summer families just come and go.

699
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,820
i remember i wanted to...

700
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,070
go with 'em.

701
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,560
i worked really hard in my life.

702
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,470
but know what?

703
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,580
it's never been enough.

704
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,420
so i told a lie.

705
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,120
just a small,little,itty-bitty one.

706
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,790
just so i could open the door,you know?

707
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,540
and it just got bigger and bigger.

708
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,170
well,now's the time to shut it down.

709
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:41,660
ok?

710
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,430
give me the gun,hunter.

711
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,940
what,this?

712
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,780
dispatch 10 to 180,confirm your location,over.

713
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,410
280 to dispatch,i'm off highway 5 near morton creek.intruder possible.

714
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,210
stand by.

715
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:55,880
where's jim?

716
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,780
he's still inside.stay here.

717
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,020
hunter,you rebuilt your life from nothing.

718
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,580
you've done that,you did it before.

719
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,490
do it again.

720
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,340
you know,you're right.

721
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,530
nothing.

722
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,990
'cause that's what i am.

723
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,240
and that ghost is more real than you'll ever be.

724
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,620
no!

725
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,410

726
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,280
jim,it's bobby.

727
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,270
try to open your eyes if you can.

728
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,300
i'm here with melinda.

729
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,240
can you hear me?

730
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,040
jim,wake up.

731
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,290
jim,please wake up.

732
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:09,010
-mel.
-i'm right here.

733
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,300
oh,my god,i'm so sorry.

734
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,350
i tried to get here as fast as i could.

735
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,210
don't be sorry.

736
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,130
there's no pain.

737
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,810
you don't have to be brave.

738
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,840
i'm not,honey,i'm in shock.

739
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,860
i don't feel any pain.

740
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,190
oh,god!

741
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,250
guys,it doesn't mean i didn't feel that.

742
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,620
dude,wait.

743
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,700
sorry about our date.

744
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,520
shh,it's ok.

745
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,860
-rain check--
-yes,yes.

746
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,940
we gotta go.

747
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,910
i'll hold you to that.

748
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,380
go.

749
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,930
i didn't know what you wanted,so i got you hot chocolate,tea and coffee.

750
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,580
you're sweet.

751
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,370
hey,i'll put it down here.

752
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,050
so any news?

753
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,920
he was supposed to be out of surgery 40 minutes agoms.

754
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,990
gordon?

755
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,970
yes?

756
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:32,130
jim's surgery was successful,and he's in stable condition.

757
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,230
oh,thank god.

758
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:36,070
if you like,i can walk you down to the recovery area.

759
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,680
we'll wait here.

760
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,880
the damage was much less than we first thought.

761
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,170
the bullet went straight through his armand just barely grazed his ribs.

762
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,560
so he's going to be ok?

763
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,260
we'll be keeping an eye on him tonight.

764
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,230
there's always the risk of infection,

765
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:52,790
and especially with gunshot woundswe need to keep an eye out for embolisms.

766
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,320
we'll have our best cardiologist watching him through the night.

767
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,730
thank you.

768
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,030
a nurse will call you in soon.

769
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,480
how is he?

770
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,500
he's resting.

771
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,760
i feel horrible,for so many reasons.

772
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,860
it's ok,it's not your fault.

773
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,540
he'd be happy that you're here.

774
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,360
thanks.

775
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,110
owen's here too.

776
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,670
he is?

777
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,830
you can talk to him if you'd like.

778
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,120
i...think he wants you to.

779
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,320
owen...

780
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:46,540
owen,i wish i could still see you,like i used to.

781
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,840
but somehow i've gotten blindas i've gotten older.

782
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,590
i brought a stranger into our lives.

783
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,540
how could i not see who he was?

784
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,910
you see enough.

785
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,620
he says you see enough.

786
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,060
but i was completely--

787
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,120

788
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,430
yeah?

789
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,430
let him talk.

790
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,560
tell her to look hard.

791
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,920
ask what she sees.

792
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,150
he wants you to look hard...

793
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,660
see what you see.

794
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,670
nothing.

795
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,530
sorry,i just...

796
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,970
i only see my girl.

797
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,510
what?

798
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,650
you tell her.

799
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,170
he says you still see it.

800
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,110

801
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,260

802
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,140
everything...

803
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,320
that matters.

804
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,460
come here.

805
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,480
thank you,owen.

806
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,210
no.

807
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,960
thank you.

808
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,440
you were my friend.

809
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,480

810
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,250
what's that light?

811
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,640
you see it because you did a really good job.

812
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,910
i bet your grandma's there.

813
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,010
she's been waiting.

814
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,600

818
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,520
he's gone.

819
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:15,960
i love you so much,sweet girl.

820
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,460
has he woken up yet?

821
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,780
just the once,after anesthesia.

822
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,560
do you mind if i stay till he wakes again?

823
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,450
thank you.

mel,there's a thing that happened,um...

831
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,490
uh,that's called an embolism.

832
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,710
it's a technical term,and you don't need to know about it.

833
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,990

834
