129
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,880
hi.Wow.Good morning,indeed.

130
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,730
You just missed a fascinating
hour on megalithomania.

131
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,980
Oh.That's my favorite.

132
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,130
Um,actually,could I talk to you for a minute?

133
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,890
Well,yeah.For you,I have more than a minute.

134
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,840
Well,I don't know how to say this,except.

135
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:47,790
being with you last night reminded me
of how much it hurt when you dumped me.

136
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,070
Oh,I--I prefer to say,"broke up with.

137
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,530
" See,and I can't get
my heart broken again,ricky.

138
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,710
So it was fun.

139
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,540
- Nina.
- Hey.

140
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,330
You take care of yourself.Ok?

141
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,150
Nina.Come on.

142
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,550
Nina,come on.

143
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,970
Are you happy now,darling?

144
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,070
As if that's possible.

145
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,790
Honey,you want a glass of wine?

146
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,620
No,thanks.

147
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,830
Makes me sleepy.

148
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,330
Melinda,you can't stay awake forever.

149
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,750
And lookin' at these masks is
not doin' you any good right now.

150
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,530
I'm just trying to figure out which mask the guy's wearing
in one of my dreams or memories,whatever they are.

151
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,250
I know,but maybe you should take a break.

152
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,890
I don't know.

153
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,980
Uh,maybe help kate cross over.

154
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,450
Staying away from that one.

155
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,800
- Really?
- Yeah.

156
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,300
Payne doesn't want my help.

157
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,790
He seems to think this is
his chance to get back at her,

158
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,570
and she doesn't wanna
go anywhere near a light,so.

159
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,310
yeah.I get it.

160
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,020
Mel,I'm worried about you.

161
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,800
You hardly get any sleep these days.

162
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,690
And when you do,your nightmares are getting worse.

163
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,610
The only way it's gonna stop is if I can figure out
who this mask guy is and what he's trying to tell me.

164
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,970
I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my father.

165
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,650
Well,do you think you should talk to a professional?

166
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,960
I don't need therapy.

167
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,000
No,I mean,do you think you should
talk to a private investigator?

168
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,510
Remember my cop friend,carl neely?

169
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,990
It's what he does.He moonlights.

170
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,620
I mean,he could tell you how your
dad died,when,where he's buried,even.

171
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,230
You want me to call him?

172
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,060
Ricky.

173
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,120
- Hi.
- Hi.

174
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,820
Hi.

175
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,930
What are you doin' here?

176
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,150
Uh,I'm sorry about the hour,but,
uh,it's just-- can I come in?

177
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,190
- Uh,no.
- No.

178
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,380
- No.
- No.

179
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,540
Um,I'll come out.

180
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,980
Look,uh,I-- I don't,uh,blame you.

181
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,170
I wouldn't really trust me either.

182
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,210
But you need to know this.

183
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,560
I had--well,I had my heart
broken,twice,as a matter of fact.

184
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,320
I mean,once when kate died,and then
another time after she was already dead,

185
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,880
I found out that she had an affair.

186
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,020
I'm sorry.I--I didn't know.

187
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,780
I'm much more sensitive to people's
hearts since my heart has been ripped out

188
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,790
and kicked around like a hacky sack.

189
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,450
And the fact of the matter is we
really had a good time last night.

190
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,370
Yeah,we did.I know--

191
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,470
'cause if you're in town for a week,
we should make a go of this thing,

192
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,020
I mean,go have lunch.What's lunch?

193
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,840
Nobody ever got hurt by a lunch,unless
of course there was a food-borne illness,

194
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,870
and-- why are we whispering,exactly?

195
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,330
You're not alone in there,are you?

196
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,160
No.

197
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,230
No.

198
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,680
But it's not what you're thinking.

199
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,950
Mom,who you talkin' to?

200
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,470
Just a friend,baby.You go back to sleep,ok?

201
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,320
"Mom"?

202
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,410
I usually detonate that bomb on
the third or fourth date,but yes.

203
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,250
I have a son.

204
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,460
His name is elliot.

205
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,360
And since I would have to bring him
to lunch tomorrow,you can flee now.

206
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,030
No.No,I'm not fleeing.

207
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,350
Oh,no.

208
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,550
You-- you should bring him to lunch with us.

209
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,420
I love kids.What kind of a guy doesn't like kids?

210
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,020
I hate kids!

211
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,770
Maybe "hate" is a strong word,but
I have a profound lack of understanding
for the need to breed.

212
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,960
Plus,all kids are just filled with snot.

213
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,290
So it's a nonstarter for you.

214
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,410
I just think single moms are dicey.

215
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,910
None taken.

216
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,780
What?

217
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,320
I was just hopin' you'd throw a "no offense"
my way,but guess I gave you too much credit.

218
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,710
Oh,no,no,no,no,no.But your son ned,he's different.

219
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,020
He's a-- he's a teen or
tween or whatever they're called.

220
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,680
Teen'll do.

221
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,420
He's a teen.

222
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,600
And look,he's interacting.

223
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,950
Cyclical conversation.

224
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,570
He's fine.

225
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,600
He's self-sufficient.

226
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,660
Nina's son isn't going to be self-sufficient,and
he's gonna be a complete germ bag,for crying out loud.

227
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,480
Hey.You are a mom.

228
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,290
You could help me.

229
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,390
You--you can watch this kid while I go to lunch.

230
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,430
Oh,sorry,but I am taking my
son on a dicey single-mom lunch.

231
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,720
Let's go,ned.

232
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,190
- So what's the deal with that guy?
- You don't want to know.

233
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,190
Don't even look at me.

234
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,140
Hi,guys.

235
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,880
This is elliot.

236
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,400
El,it's professor payne.

237
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,300
Hello,young man.

238
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,120
How are you?

239
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,370
Hello,professor payne.

240
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,170
Please,call me,uh-- actually,
call me professor.That's good.

241
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,130
Hi.Elliot,I'm melinda.

242
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,700
Some people think dust is
mostly flakes from human skin.

243
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,580
Elliot.

244
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,900
A-actually dust is a lot of things.

245
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,170
Could be pet dander,pollen.

246
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,960
It could be soot.

247
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,760
Yeah,but its overall makeup
depends on where you live.

248
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,930
I think the human skin thing
was started to sell dust spray.

249
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,790
Are you an academician?

250
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,140
Oh,spare me.

251
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,080
Nobody but rick's that pretentious.

252
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,540
As a matter of fact,I am.

253
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,640
Why would you ask me that?

254
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,680
So's my dad.

255
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,470
You see,his,um,dad's
not really in the picture.

256
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,070
He's-- he's on an extended sabbatical in india.

257
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,100
They can't get text messages there.

258
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,830
Mind if i take a look at your victrola?

259
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,390
No.Go right ahead.

260
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,420
Uh,elliot,how old are you exactly?

261
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,680
Almost 10,sir.

262
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,850
That's a decade.

263
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,270
When's your birthday?

264
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,610
August 27.

265
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,690
I'm a virgo.

266
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,120
And we broke up in.

267
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,230
this isn't happening.

268
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,570
Maybe it's not what it seems.

269
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,710
Can I talk to you alone?

270
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,200
I just remembered we've got a,
uh,thing we're gonna be late for.

271
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,240
El,baby,come on.We gotta go.

272
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,250
Nice to meet you all.

273
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,280
Bye,guys.

274
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,080
there's no way I'm that kid's father,right?

275
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,310
Well,ignoring what she's
already told him about his dad,

276
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,120
the fact that he seems
to have your dna,math--

277
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:00,890
you're not helping.

278
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,580
You asked.

279
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,510
I know I asked.

280
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,290
You could always take a paternity test.

281
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,430
And confirm something
that I don't want to be true?

282
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,990
She hasn't exactly demanded one.

283
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,980
It's my own darn fault for chasing after her.

284
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,230
I--I didn't want kids when
I was married,let alone now.

285
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,660
Oh,neither do I,not yet anyway.

286
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,130
Why don't you want kids?

287
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,050
Do you mind me asking?

288
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,040
I do mind,actually,but I will answer.

289
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,870
It's your porch.

290
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,280
Kids are a huge responsibility,
and,uh,I'm selfish.

291
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,330
What's your excuse?

292
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:31,930
I'm afraid of juggling,you know,
the-- the feeding and the diapers
while dead people harass me.

293
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,980
You win.

294
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,580
I can't be a dad.

295
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,320
Look at me.I'm not father material.

296
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,010
I'm a miscreant of epic proportions.

297
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:42,930
Well,that's true.

298
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,890
All right.

299
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,280
Besides,we don't even know
if this is what nina wants.

300
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,550
Who knows what nina wants?

301
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,180
There's one way to find out.

302
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,980
I--you know what?

303
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,660
I hate talking to you.

304
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,900
I promote to a knight.

305
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:05,890
I found out I was pregnant after
you left,and I was so scared,ricky.

306
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,830
And I was gonna tell you,but you were.

307
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,400
already with kate,happy.

308
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,590
From the sounds of it,you've
all but told him I'm his dad.

309
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,570
No.I just kind of,you know,
dress it up a little.that way,

310
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,630
if he ever does find out,
it won't be such a shock to him.

311
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,860
Doesn't he have a right
to know who his father is?

312
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,100
It's complicated.

313
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,870
- Check.
- What again?

314
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,260
Oh,nice.

315
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,170
And he's mine.

316
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,820
He's brilliant.

317
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,150
He didn't get it from me.

318
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,740
Don't underestimate yourself.

319
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,010
I,uh-- I tried to enroll
him at archfield academy.

320
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,980
That's good.That's a good
school for pint-sized mensas.

321
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,280
Eh,it's not gonna happen

322
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,400
wait a minute.This kid could get into yale.

323
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,210
There's no way he didn't get accepted there.

324
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,940
Eh,he did.

325
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,460
It's just they-- they only
have 2 financial aid slots open.

326
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,770
He seems to be doin' ok at public school.

327
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,960
Public school?

328
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,910
Nina,no.

329
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,130
No,this kid's a genius.

330
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,810
You put him in public school,it's
like putting raw meat in a piranha tank.

331
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,730
They'll eat him alive.

332
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,910
You can't do that to him.

333
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,300
I don't sell enough
antidepressants to pay for it.

334
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,860
When kate died,I got a call
from my life insurance company.

335
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,440
Here's my wife of 8 years
dies in a freak accident.

336
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,300
Now they just wanna cut me a check.

337
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,400
I felt pretty awkward about it.

338
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,490
I didn't know what to do.
I never invested the money.

339
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,740
I just kept it in my savings account.

340
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,410
Bottom line is I'd like to use
that money to pay for elliot's school.

341
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,680
No.

342
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,160
Ricky,that's too generous.

343
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,020
Now,I didn't come here to ask you for money.

344
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,550
I didn't come here to ask you for anything.

345
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,460
I know that.

346
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,960
I'm pretty sure that's
what kate would have wanted.

347
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,340
You should move your pawn.

348
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,500
Don't count on it.

349
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,820
I don't need you to teach
me how to play chess,kid.

350
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,650
I'm just saying,if I were
you--I'd sacrifice my pawn.

351
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,780
Ah,he really is a chip
off the old payne,isn't he?

352
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,130
Alexander,you mind if I cut in?

353
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,140
This kid's too smart for me.

354
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,390
Well,don't blame it on him.

355
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,070
It's just his dna,I guess.

356
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,060
Unbelievable.

357
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,890
Do you mind if I finish his game?

358
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,070
Sure,professor,but you'll lose.

359
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,070
Whoa!

360
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,830
How 'bout you and i start from scratch?

361
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,440
Honey,I'm home.

362
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:49,230
Oh,how many times have I told you
about leavin' your shoes in the foyer,kate?

363
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,280
You know,kate,the scientist
in me is very intrigued,

364
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,710
but the human being in me has hair standing up in places
that I didn't even know that I had hair.

365
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,170
Come on,kate!

366
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,710
Is that the best you got?!

367
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,170
All right.

368
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,520
Getting better.

369
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:26,130
Oh,honey,that is such a textbook haunting.

370
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,280
A screw.

371
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,910
Are you tryin' to tell me something?

372
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,590
Ok,fine!

373
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,910
You wanna have this out!

374
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,560
Let's have it out right now!

375
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,810
You cheated on me with one of my colleagues!

376
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,990
So what right do you have to be mad at me?!

377
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,780
You think this is about infidelity?

378
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,480
What was that,honey?

379
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,410
I didn't quite hear you.

380
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,350
payne,where are you?

381
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,680
Here's something I never thought
I'd say-- I'm in here under the piano.

382
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,850
Oh,my.god

383
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,310
are you ok?

384
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,430
Well,not to be captain obvious,but not really.

385
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,710
There's an 800-pound baby grand on my back.

386
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,340
Can you feel anything?

387
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,080
Yes,jim,I can feel everything.

388
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,760
Thank you.

389
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,280
I'm gonna get the car jack.

390
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,170
I'm so sorry.

391
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,360
How's that?

392
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,220
Ahh.It only hurts when it hurts.

393
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,570
We're gonna have to get this x-rayed
and get you to the emergency room.

394
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,260
So you gonna tell me what happened?

395
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,220
Well,I was drunk.

396
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,960
I came home.

397
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,000
I decided to plow through my own
bookcase,swing from the chandelier,

398
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,130
and then me and the piano
rolled around on the floor-- all right.

399
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,330
I got in a fight with kate.

400
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,360
Yeah.She's obviously trying to tell you something.

401
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:50,980
Right.

402
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,430
It's like ghost charades with props.

403
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,240
You know,she seemed pretty upset
the day that you met elliot.

404
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,130
Is there something you're not telling me?

405
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,350
Well,kate wanted kids,and so did i
for a brief,brief moment of insanity,

406
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,980
and we tried everything,all the fertility drugs.

407
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,370
It was killing kate that nothing was working,
and I told her,"don't worry about it.

408
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,700
I don't even want kids," but you know the way i have
that great talent for saying things the wrong way.

409
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,140
It just--it got ugly.

410
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,430
Now you have one,a kid.

411
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,580
And she doesn'T.

412
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,660
That hurt?

413
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,050
Ah,compared to being under a piano,it's ok.

414
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,090
Do you think that's why she's
upset,because of elliot?

415
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,290
Well,I think it's only gonna
get worse until she crosses over.

416
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,770
Well,look,I don't speak ghost,
and I don't do humility very well.

417
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,940
Would you please talk to her,mediate,whatever?

418
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,320
Yes.

419
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,000
- Hey.Please?
- Ok.

420
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,640
Just stop baiting her.

421
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,470
I will not bait her anymore.

422
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,270
What's that look?

423
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,740
Nothing.

424
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,680
- Hey.
- How is he?

425
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,250
Lucky.

426
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,330
His foot's pretty banged up,but,uh,

427
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,010
hairline fracture of the tibia,
\and he broke his little toe.

428
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,930
He'll be fine.

429
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,820
Look,uh.

430
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:06,540
I heard you two talking about how
much payne's wife wanted a kid.

431
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,020
- And I hate to bring this up again,but
- I'm so sorry.

432
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,800
Could you just hold that thought?

433
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,180
I always do.

434
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,730
Maternity Ward
Nursery
Labor & Delivery

435
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,970
You could have killed him.

436
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,660
I lost my temper.

437
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,220
He has that effect on me.

438
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,090
And anyway,I thought he
could stand to suffer a little.

439
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,500
Hasn't he done that already?

440
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,820
I mean,it's been 3 years,kate.

441
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,700
It's time for you to let him move on.

442
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,330
The way he's let me move on?

443
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,940
He told me you wanted a baby.

444
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,400
Oh,I know what he told you.

445
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,480
I'm a ghost,darling.

446
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,870
I can go places,hear things.

447
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,550
It's the only upside to an otherwise lousy state.

448
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,620
I'm sorry.I really need your help.

449
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,090
I was here first.

450
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,380
Sorry.

451
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,640
That happens all the time.

452
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,820
Look,obviously you're upset that he has a child.

453
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,960
- Ok,it doesn't seem fair,and I get that.
- Do you?

454
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,880
She shows up here with this boy and plays her
sad little violin about needing money to

455
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,270
get him into some special school,
and he's all too ready to just write her a check

456
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,890
for my life insurance money,no less.

457
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,730
Seems a bit sketchy to me.

458
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,660
So you think she's playing him.

459
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,840
You're a clever girl.

460
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,930
Figure it out.

461
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,170
Hey,you.

462
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,040
What happened?

463
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,420
Broke my vestigial appendage.

464
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,450
- I'm fine,though.Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

465
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,140
- Yeah,but just let me go first,ok?
- Ok.

466
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,420
All right.Um.

467
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,980
I thought about your offer to pay
for elliot's school,and.

468
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,010
I accept.

469
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,980
And then I--
I swear we'll go back to the city,

470
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,990
and you'll never hear from us again.

471
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,870
I've been thinkin' a lot about it,too,
and I don't wanna be a checkbook dad,nina.

472
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,480
So the offer's no good anymore?

473
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,220
No,the--the offer still stands.

474
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,160
I just wanna sw-sweeten the pot.

475
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,620
I-I've thought a lot about it,and that is,I-if I'm...

476
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,560
ok,if I'm going to be elliot's dad,

477
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,350
then I wanna be elliot's dad.

478
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,050
How would that work exactly?

479
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,290
Well,we could take it slow.

480
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,650
You don't have to tell him right away.

481
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,240
You guys can move in with me.

482
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,730
Oh,r-ricky,wait.Slow down.

483
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,660
No,uh,it's not-- you know.

484
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,840
I have lots of space,lots of space,

485
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,670
and you and I,we don't have to
be this instant couple right away.

486
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,000
We don't even have to be a couple at all,
even,you know,but,um,

487
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,570
there's a great satellite school that the
college offers for gifted children.

488
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,510
We could enroll elliot there and--
I just--I don't know.

489
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,310
I think I'm ready.

490
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,510
I'm really ready to be a dad.

491
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,430
At least,I'm ready to give it a try.

492
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,040
So,uh,how is this all goin' over at home?

493
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,100
Well,you can tell that jim wants to talk about it.

494
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,180
I keep sidestepping.

495
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,550
I mean,what's the big rush,right?

496
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,760
There's gotta be some huge compromise
somewhere between forever and right now.

497
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,110
Yeah,except for men pretty much have forever,
and women don'T.

498
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,410
I'm still young.

499
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,250
ish...Ok?There's plenty of time.

500
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,050
Besides,I have to cross kate over,

501
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,330
and I can't do that until I find out
if nina's telling the truth,

502
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,560
which means you should stop changing the subject.

503
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,700
You know,you could always get that P.I.
you hired to help you out.

504
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,430
And distract him from getting me
more information on my dad?

505
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:55,990
I don't think so.

506
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,360
You know what I really need to do is
just yank a hair right out of payne's head

507
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,120
and then do my own paternity test.

508
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:05,310
You know,as much fun as that sounds,
I have a simpler idea.

509
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,680
Ready?

510
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,570
Hello.Yes,

511
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:17,490
is principal stickley available for dean
julia marlowe from the archfield academy?

512
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,220
It's regarding elliot haley.

513
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,960
I'll hold.

514
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,100
This sleuthing stuff is kinda fun.

515
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,560
You're oddly good at it.

516
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,010
Yes.One moment,please,for dean marlow.

517
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,400
Hello.Principal stickley.

518
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,500
Yes,we did receive elliot's application,
but the birth certificate,though,

519
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,790
I-it was a fax of a fax,
and so you know how that goes.

520
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,650
We really need to get the father's name.

521
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,270
Pen.

522
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,730
Yes.

523
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,710
Thank you so much for your trouble.

524
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,240
Damn.

525
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,360
I think you're just beating yourself up
over an accident.

526
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,570
Your time here earthbound,
it's about your redemption.

527
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,410
You did that.

528
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,900
You made that sacrifice.

529
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,450
But is it that simple?

530
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,760
It is if you can see the light.

531
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,500
Yeah.

532
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,640
Yeah,it's-- it's on the other side of that car.

533
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,930
What do I do?

534
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,390
Go into it.

535
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,740
Sort things out on the other side.

536
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,290
- Another one.
- Yep.

537
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,800
Just a random ghost.

538
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,640
Sometimes I wish they'd just leave me alone.

539
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,060
Yeah,you and me both.

540
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,330
So what am I gonna do?

541
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,840
I mean,am I gonna talk to rick,am I gonna confront nina,
or am I gonna just move to canada?

542
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,130
You'll figure it out.You always do.

543
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,410
That was really helpful.Thanks.

544
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,770
You want my real opinion?

545
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,730
I feel like you should tell rick first.

546
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,640
Why?

547
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:18,510
'Cause you guys have so much in common,
I think he'll be relieved that the kid is not his.

548
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,850
So that's why you're being distant.

549
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,040
We've talked about this.

550
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,580
Yeah,I know.We've talked,and we've talked,

551
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,820
and,melinda,I gotta say sometimes

552
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,630
I feel like you use your gift as an excuse
and that you care more about the dead than--

553
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,270
that is not fair,ok?

554
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,350
I'm just not ready to have a baby.

555
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,040
I'm beginning to wonder if you ever will.

556
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,520
I mean,we've been married 3 years.

557
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,870
Yeah,and we're still young.

558
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,310
Yeah.

559
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,780
So were payne and kate.

560
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,470
Look what happened to them.

561
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,520
- I gotta go to work.
- Yep.

562
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,830
Let me know how it goes with carl.

563
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,250
Have to tell you up front,melinda,
your father left a pretty cold trail.

564
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,650
Since 1989?

565
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:07,120
Uh,'91,2 years after you said
he left you and your mother for good.

566
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,530
Drained his bank account.Cashed out his ira.

567
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,930
Went back to the woman in colorado he had a son with.

568
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,210
Gabriel,my half-brother.

569
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,840
Other than that,the only record I have of him
is workin' as a short-order cook at a debby's in arizona.

570
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,540
What?

571
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,860
I mean,my dad was a lawyer.
That doesn't make any sense.

572
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,720
It does if he was on the run from somethin'.

573
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:26,880
The run from what?

574
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:33,570
Melinda,when you first asked me to look into this,
you told me your father was dead.

575
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,490
You were pretty certain of that.

576
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,890
Yeah.I guess I have...

577
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:43,130
been telling myself that for so long
that I started to believe it.

578
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,140
There's no record of his death?

579
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,100
Not that I could find.

580
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,070
No burial.No cremation.

581
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,190
The list of john does in this country's huge,
and without dental records or dna,

582
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,390
it's a needle in a haystack.

583
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,600
Look,I have some other leads,but--heh.

584
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,670
I'm startin' to feel guilty takin' your money.

585
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,010
You found out more than I ever could.

586
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,220
Well,it's your call.

587
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,750
Just don't give up,please.

588
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,600
I really need to know.

589
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,890
So I guess the final question is just do
I make the check out to archfield academy,

590
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,470
or,I mean,I could make the check out to
the school that's here in grandview.

591
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,710
I'm not tryin' to force a decision.

592
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,300
I know.

593
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,270
I'm just gonna need to take some time
to think about it,so.

594
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,810
maybe if you just make the check out to me,
I can put it into elliot's school fund.

595
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,190
That way,I can prove I can afford
whichever school he applies to.

596
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,420
What are these,professor?

597
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,870
Those are my fetishes.

598
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,930
Ricky?

599
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,020
He's 10.

600
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,720
I know he's 10.

601
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,120
That's actually what they're called.

602
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,210
They're called fetishes.

603
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,400
They're carvings from an ancient
zuni tribe from new mexico.

604
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,980
They carve each animal,

605
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,180
and they think that there's a spirit inside them,
giving each one a very specific power.

606
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,140
Why don't you pick one up and give it a try?

607
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,660
Ah.The wily fox.

608
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,310
He keeps his owner safe.

609
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,250
What you do is you put his nostrils in your mouth--

610
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,860
Inhales And you inhale.

611
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,430
Go ahead.Give it a try.

612
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,260
No,thanks.It's still flu season.

613
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,160
Hi,everyone.

614
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,150
Hey.

615
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,770
Actually,I'm here to see nina.

616
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,420
- You are?\n- Yeah.

617
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,140
Who's brian dobbs?

618
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,900
Who?

619
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,350
He was on the birth certificate as the father.

620
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,640
- How did you f
- I made a phone call.

621
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,900
And I can make some more.Yeah.Do I need to?

622
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,250
- It's not what you think.
- It's exactly what I think.

623
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,840
The question is are you gonna tell payne,or am I?

624
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,580
Hey.

625
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,480
- Sorry I'm late.
- No.Right on time.

626
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,600
Technically I should have them stored in cornmeal.

627
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,710
That's what they eat,and the more they eat,
the better they are,and the more power they have.

628
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,010
Uh,nina said that is was ok for delia
to take elliot for some ice cream.

629
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,590
Ok.What's going on?

630
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,750
Come on.

631
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,960
We'll be in the cafeteria.

632
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,740
Brian dobbs?

633
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,130
The guy that used to hang out in the
laundry room of our building,brian dobbs?

634
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,570
Anyway,he was nice to me.

635
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,850
After you started hangin' out with kate,
I saw the writing on the wall.

636
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,730
So he took advantage of you.

637
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,110
After you left,I found out I was 3 months pregnant.

638
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,740
When I told brian,he demanded I take a paternity test.

639
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,440
Kind of backfired on him.

640
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,540
He hung around for about a year.

641
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,720
Then he split.

642
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,030
Then what happened?

643
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,840
Bastard stole my social security number.

644
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,180
All of a sudden,I've got all these--
these credit card bills piling up.

645
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,610
I find out he's drained my savings account,

646
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,200
and I haven't heard from him since.

647
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,550
He left me with a one-year-
old and buried under a mountain of debt,

648
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,770
and I've been killin' myself,
tryin' to pay it off for years,

649
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,860
and now it's gonna cost my son his school.

650
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,070
I've never done anything like this before.

651
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,750
Why me?

652
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,680
Why'd you start with me?

653
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,100
I just thought the rick payne I remembered would.

654
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,010
give me money to make the problem go away.

655
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,210
I never in a million years thought
you'd want to be in elliot's life.

656
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,590
So I'm sorry for what I did.

657
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,560
Mostly I'm sorry I underestimated you.

658
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,090
Well,you're not half as sorry as I am.

659
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,080
I think you should go.

660
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,050
Yeah.I think you should go.

661
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,490
Kate.

662
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,930
Are you here?'Cause he really wants to talk to you.

663
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,800
Spooky.Is that it?

664
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:08,070
I bet you feel really stupid now that
it turns out the kid isn't even mine,don't you,honey?

665
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,410
Ask him how he thinks it makes me feel to watch him,

666
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:13,330
a man who told me flat out he
didn't want to have children with me,

667
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,840
become completely and utterly destroyed
over some kid who wasn't even his to begin with.

668
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:23,880
She's a little angry at how upset you were
when you found out that elliot wasn't yours.

669
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,150
What's that got to do with us?

670
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,900
I'll tell you exactly what that's got to do with us,
you miserable little.

671
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,320
I will not repeat that,and,you,calm down.

672
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,710
Why?What happened?What did she say?

673
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,590
She's angry.

674
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,540
because she thinks you didn't want a baby with her.

675
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,740
Wow.She thinks I didn't wanna have kids with her?

676
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,550
Kate,I--that's not what I said at all.

677
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,080
- Yes,you did,repeatedly.
- And I never once made this about you or about me,

678
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,230
- and you wanna think that I'm selfish.
- "One more year.

679
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,340
We have so much time,and look what that got--" .

680
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,510
child,elliot,and you wanna think that you're suffering.

681
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,720
- I'm the one that's suffering.
- You have no idea how much.

682
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,230
You don't even know the damn truth!

683
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,530
All right,enough!

684
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,180
She started it.

685
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,880
I didn't get any of that,nor did I want to,
but I did hear you say something about him not knowing the truth.

686
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,720
When we were trying to...

687
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,870
when I thought he wanted children as much as I did.

688
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,190
we were doing in vitro,fertility injections,and.

689
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,620
were you gonna tell me,rick?

690
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,510
I need a little more here.

691
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:29,170
The dean called.

692
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,240
Your grant's been approved.

693
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,640
2 years in peru when we're
trying to get pregnant,

694
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,880
and you didn't tell me.

695
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,970
Move over.

696
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,360
Come on.

697
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:50,870
Look,I am nowhere near ready
to have a child now,ok?

698
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,340
But we've very young.

699
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,240
We have lots of time.We have
all the time in the world,so...

700
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,430
it's ok.

701
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,670
Professor payne.

702
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,940
Sure.

703
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:12,460
It's the fertility clinic.

704
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,170
I know all this.

705
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:16,900
They called.

706
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:20,480
They said her eggs were not viable,
and she accused me of being relieved.

707
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,780
We fought.Blah,blah,blah.

708
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,670
I lied.

709
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,030
The doctor said we were good to go.

710
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,520
That was my one chance to get pregnant,

711
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,060
but because I knew he didn't want it.

712
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,200
I lied.

713
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,810
Few weeks later,I was dead.

714
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,650
What is it?

715
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,410
She lied.

716
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,860
She lied to you because she thought
you didn't want children.

717
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,290
The doctor said it was a good time.

718
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,750
She thought it was her only chance.

719
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,620
I didn't know.

720
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,710
If she lied,why is she mad at me?

721
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:01,660
I'm angry because you knew I wanted children.

722
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,140
and you said you wanted that,too.

723
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,250
Then every time I brought it up,
you just pushed me away.

724
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,590
But that didn't make it stop.

725
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,820
Even now,it.

726
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:21,850
I know it's not possible,so why
does the ache only get worse?

727
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:28,770
It hurts so much.

728
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,740
How can you make that go away?

729
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,460
I can'T.

730
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,320
But you have to move on now.

731
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,510
I mean,you know that.

732
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,400
You know I can'T.

733
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,380
Kate,please don't go.

734
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,640
oh,my god.

735
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,920
What is it?

736
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,570
Well,kate told me about her death,
but listen to this old article.

737
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,640
"A construction crane plummeted 8 stories "

738
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,290
at a brookside office complex
late yesterday morning,

739
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,410
"crushing to death a motorist
who was making a u-turn,

740
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,670
"the victim later identified as katherine payne.

741
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,410
Payne died moments before her body was freed.

742
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,360
" That is awful.

743
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,630
How random.

744
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,400
Just making a u-turn.

745
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,180
Hi.

746
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,830
I'm sorry just to show up like this.

747
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,480
- No.No.
- No.

748
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,990
What's goin' on?

749
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,500
Go on.

750
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,780
I took this from professor payne.

751
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,610
My mom wants you to give it
back to him for me and.

752
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,620
tell him I'm sorry.

753
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,800
Look,I may not be the world's best role model,

754
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,720
but I'm trying to raise an honest kid here.

755
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,100
No.You know what?

756
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,090
maybe you should do this yourself in person.

757
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:59,610
Pretty sure ricky never wants to see me again.

758
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,850
I think you might be surprised.

759
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,660
Are you crazy?

760
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,660
I told you I never wanna see her again.

761
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,210
That's why I put you in a moving
car before I told you.

762
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,880
Why don't you just waterboard me instead?

763
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,380
Wait a minute.

764
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,470
This is where kate died.

765
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,200
I hate this place.

766
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,410
Why would you bring me here?

767
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,020
Trying to kill 2 birds with one ghost.Come on.

768
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,860
Well,thanks.

769
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,270
What is it?

770
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,390
The fox fetish is in there.

771
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,700
I took good care of him just like you said.

772
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,450
You took it from me without asking?

773
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,860
Yeah.

774
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,470
I'm...I'm sorry.

775
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,600
I just thought it'd keep my mom and me safe.

776
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,630
Ok.

777
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,920
I thought you'd be here.

778
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,080
Seems like I'm always here.

779
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,230
There's this constant pull.

780
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,400
I...it's because this is
where your time was cut short.

781
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:04,420
You know,I don't normally
reward thievery,young man,

782
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,650
but I'm gonna make an exception.

783
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,440
I want you to do me a favor,elliot.

784
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,700
I want you to take this box,

785
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,690
and I want you to keep it,

786
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,850
because that way,

787
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:18,400
you'll always know that somebody's lookin'
out for you and your mommy,ok?

788
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,410
- Damn him.
- All right.

789
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,920
Listen,go,uh...

790
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,860
why don't you go wait in the car or somethin'.

791
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,540
I have to talk to your mom,ok?

792
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,660
Thank you,professor.

793
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:47,570
Well,if I felt stupid before,
I really feel stupid now.

794
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,330
He really got accepted to archfield academy?

795
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,460
Yeah.

796
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,380
Yeah.That much is true.

797
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,350
That's good.

798
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,000
That's good.

799
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,200
I'm proud of him,and I'm still paying for it.

800
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,970
You don't have to do that,ricky.

801
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,120
I know.That's why I'm doing it.

802
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,500
And for the record,after that first night,

803
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,970
I wasn't gonna go through with it,

804
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:09,490
but then you just surprised me.

805
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,280
And I started wishing it was true.

806
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,770
My grandma used to say,"wish again,

807
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,660
'cause you got bad luck on that last one.

808
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,610
There's another reason why
you keep getting dra here.

809
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,320
Wn I think it's what you're really mad about.

810
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,160
You wanted more time,and you were mad at him,

811
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,040
because he always promised
that there would be more.

812
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,240
It's not his fault.

813
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,440
Well,I don't have to guess who
you're talking to,do I?

814
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,860
Hello,kate.

815
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,250
Hi.

816
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,140
She says hi.

817
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,690
I don't want you to be mad at me,but I...

818
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,490
I can't stand the thought of that little
boy not getting what he needs,

819
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,300
whether he's my son or not.

820
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,820
She doesn't seem angry.

821
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,430
I'm sorry the guy I was
didn't wanna have kids.

822
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,460
It's 'cause I was selfish.

823
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,390
I just wanted you all for myself.

824
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,110
Think I needed to believe that
elliot was my son,because.

825
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,470
I don't have you anymore.

826
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,960
I'm sorry I didn't forgive you.

827
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,030
I forgive you.

828
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,330
But I couldn't before,because
I wasn't ready to let you go.

829
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,320
Oh,crap.

830
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,270
- You see it,don't you?
- Yeah.

831
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,830
It's magnificent.

832
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,150
Tell him I said I still love him.

833
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:58,500
and I think he'll make a
wonderful father someday.

834
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,080
I promise.

835
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,690
Good-bye,rick.

836
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:15,050
Tell him he should put his
ring in the sock drawer.

837
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,620
That way,when he opens it,

838
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,080
he'll think of me every now and again.

839
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,390
Hey,mel.I'm home.

840
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,130
You've got the.wedding china out.What's,uh...

841
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,850

842
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,360
Just celebrating life.

843
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,800
That's all.

844
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,370
Look,I'm sorry about today.

845
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,380
I...I'm not mad if that's

846
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,170
- what this is about.
- No.

847
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,470
It's not,not at all.I...

848
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,960
was just thinking about
what you said,and you're right.

849
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,520
I mean.

850
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,240
we never know what's gonna happen.

851
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,680
Wait a minute.

852
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:28,070
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

853
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,880
Let's have a baby.

854
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,570
Uh,look,don't do this just for me.

855
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,170
- I'm...
- no.

856
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,280
It's for us.

857
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,480
Life is too short.

858
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:45,190
You know?What the hell are we waiting for?

859
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,090
Oh,god,I love you.

860
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,650
I love you.

861
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,040
Don't answer it.

862
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,850
Oh,no.It's carl.

863
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:59,620
I told him to come by.

864
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,070
- He wanted to

865
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,380
- All right.I'm
-all right.

866
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,040
Look,I'm gonna go in the shower.

867
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,980
Hold this whole.

868
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,480
- hey.
- Hi.

869
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,370
Uh,look,I'm sorry.

870
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,900
This is it,everything
I could find on your father,

871
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,920
which isn't much.

872
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,900
Sorry I couldn't find more.

873
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,620
Are you ok?

874
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,460
Um,sorry.

875
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:32,630
It's chilly tonight.

876
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,930
Here.

877
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,390
What are these numbers?

878
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,070
I don't know.Must have pulled an old file folder.

879
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,200
It's not my handwriting.

880
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,810
Carl,I just saw you write them down.

881
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,110
I'm sorry,mel.I have no idea
what you're talkin' about.

882
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,490
Good night.

883
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,060
