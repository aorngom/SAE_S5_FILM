1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,485
Hey, by the way, thanks
for keepin' me company.

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,310
And miss a chance to ride
out to the country? Sure.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,420
Maybe you and jim will
move out here someday.

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,455
No. Jim is a city boy.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,975
I think village square is about
as country as he's gonna get.

6
00:00:22,393 --> 00:00:23,995
I never thought this
house would sell.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,730
Yeah, you and me both.

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,206
It's changed hands
4 times in 10 years.

9
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:30,907
Well, you know what they say.
It is the most haunted house...

10
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:32,470
In driscoll county.

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,807
I think it's not selling
'cause it's a money pit,

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,000
Not because of the ghosts.

13
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:38,300
Wow. This from you?

14
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,575
Vacant houses usually
aren't haunted.

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,300
No?

16
00:00:41,305 --> 00:00:43,703
They need the energy of
the living to feed off of.

17
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:45,204
There are more ghosts
in dentists' offices

18
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:47,139
Than there are in an
abandoned house like this.

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,339
Oh. Well, that must explain
my dentist's bad breath.

20
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,550
Eww.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,240
Hey! My first guests. Come on in.

22
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:57,500
Hey. Steve, i
- I hope you don't mind i brought a friend.

23
00:00:57,505 --> 00:00:59,156
This is melinda rdon. Hi.

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,359
I'm sorry. I just had
hand-To-Hand combat with a saw,

25
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,527
And the saw won.

26
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:04,694
Ouch. Yeah.

27
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:06,559
That word came in
handy a lot today,

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,144
Along with a few others, huh?

29
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,410
Well, i was just stopping by
to see how you were settling in,

30
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:12,257
If you needed anything.

31
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,381
Uh, yeah, a how-To
book on power tools.

32
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,400
This is my daughter.

33
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:18,120
Hi. Marlo, pioneer girl.

34
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,305
Do your horses need some feed?

35
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,960
Wagon wheels need a-Fixin'?

36
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,450
Marlo's just annoyed because the
closest mall is 10 miles away.

37
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,909
No, i'm annoyed because my
friends are a hundred miles away.

38
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,109
Anyway, i just have a couple papers

39
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,110
I need you to sign
from the title company.

40
00:01:31,115 --> 00:01:31,820
Yeah, sure.

41
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:35,570
You know, i think i'm
gonna clean up my thumb.

42
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:36,972
I'd rather not sign in blood.

43
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:38,990
Well, you're gonna,
whether you want to or not.

44
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,795
Hey, you work at an antique
store, too, don't you?

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,390
Uh, yeah. That's my boss.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,925
Oh. Hi.

47
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,800
Hi.

48
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:48,471
I found some really
cool old board games.

49
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:50,500
I was gonna keep some of them-

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,155
There's not a ton of entertainment
here at the homestead.

51
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,260
But i was wondering if you
could tell me what they're worth?

52
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,273
Sure. I could take a look at 'em.

53
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:58,040
Oh, perfect.

54
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,500
Have you ever heard
of a game called, uh...

55
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,705
Twister?

56
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,602
You wanna come and
check out the games?

57
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:07,939
No. I'm good. I'm
just gonna explore.

58
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,723
Ok.

59
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,200
Yep. This game. I'm not sure if
all the pieces are here, though.

60
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:15,271
This is a great game, yahtzee.

61
00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:16,205
You've never played?

62
00:02:16,272 --> 00:02:16,725
Never played it.

63
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:42,550
Is someone here?

64
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,680
Hello.

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,585
Hello.

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,820
I can help you.

67
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,275
Who are you?

68
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,246
One of them will die.

69
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,130
Are you ok?

70
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,120
Can you see us?

71
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,830
Wonder when this tipped.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,760
Floor's rotted through underneath.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,310
Made a little river
all through the ceiling.

74
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:25,315
What a mess.

75
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,600
I'm gonna see if marlo's
finished cleanin' herself up,

76
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:30,197
And i'll bring up some
paper towels and...

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,072
I'll bring her back up here.

78
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,835
You know, for a minute there...

79
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,546
You almost thought
there was a ghost?

80
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,296
No.

81
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,170
Have to remember my rule.

82
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:42,430
What rule?

83
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,175
Rational explanation
for almost everything.

84
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,660
Right.

85
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,610
Do you know why they moved?

86
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,434
You know, steve lost his
wife a few years back.

87
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,906
He said that marlo was having

88
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:12,500
A hard time in high school,

89
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:14,600
And i guess it was just too painful

90
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:15,400
To stay in the house.

91
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:16,750
Oh, that is so sad.

92
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,070
It's really hard on a kid
when they lose a parent.

93
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,365
Yeah.

94
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:24,800
It can be hard on
the other parent, too.

95
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,482
So do you know what happened?

96
00:05:29,485 --> 00:05:31,450
Do you know why she died?

97
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:33,540
No. He didn't say.
I don't know if...

98
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,749
Wait. I know that
tone in your voice.

99
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,207
You are asking for a reason.

100
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,353
I saw something, someone.

101
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,580
Are you saying that you saw
a ghost in steve's house?

102
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,031
In the garage, actually.

103
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:51,025
What? It's just that-

104
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:53,537
I mean, there's always a damn ghost

105
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,060
Everywhere you go. What is that?

106
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,086
Ok, i wish they weren't
always there, too, believe me.

107
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,700
But it's not like i go
out looking for them.

108
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,050
Don't you?

109
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,710
What?

110
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,605
Look, i'm sorry.

111
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,534
It's just that marlo and steve

112
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:11,901
Have been through so much.

113
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:13,545
They just need a clean start.

114
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:15,200
They don't need to
hear about ghosts

115
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:16,967
And have their whole
lives turned around.

116
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:19,301
Yeah, but what if the
ghost is marlo's mother?

117
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:21,700
Melinda, they especially
don't need to hear that.

118
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:23,180
They need time to heal.

119
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,752
There's obviously a-

120
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:27,140
A rational explanation. Well,
it's not always that easy.

121
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,050
I am just asking you
to give them some peace.

122
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,000
It's up to the ghost, not me.

123
00:06:37,516 --> 00:06:38,200
Fine.

124
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:40,511
You're gonna do
what you're gonna do.

125
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,417
I just sometimes
don't understand her.

126
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,100
I mean, what's it
gonna take, you know?

127
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:52,554
After all she's seen,
she can't just say,

128
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:54,001
"Ok, i get it. There's ghosts. "

129
00:06:54,068 --> 00:06:56,500
Well, sometimes what
people don't believe

130
00:06:56,504 --> 00:06:58,437
Is just as important to
them as what they do believe,

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,353
And some people feel better

132
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:02,420
Thinkin' that there's
nothin' after we die.

133
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,985
You didn't have a
hard time believing.

134
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,813
Well, it was because
i believed you.

135
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:10,100
Also, i don't know...

136
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,666
What?

137
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:13,700
Come on.

138
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:14,943
I always wanted to believe.

139
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,312
I mean, i always wanted to
believe that there was more.

140
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,856
I mean, after my father died,

141
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:21,200
I wanted to think that
everything we do here

142
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:22,650
Does not come to
nothing. And then...

143
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,600
There was melinda.

144
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,175
So what do you think?

145
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,280
Should i just stay out of it,

146
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,745
Let the family live in peace?

147
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:35,925
Hey, who says they're in peace?

148
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:39,318
I think you can cross this
ghost over quickly and quietly-

149
00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:40,818
In, out, nobody gets hurt.

150
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,118
Ha. Famous last words.

151
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,410
Are you here?

152
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,255
You scared me.

153
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:42,756
What are you doing in my garage?

154
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:46,191
I'm sorry. Um, it's
just that the, uh-

155
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:49,200
The furniture, it's so interesting.

156
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:51,710
Um, we could sell some of
it for you if you wanted.

157
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,525
I had a little something for marlo.

158
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,330
That's ok. I'd like to give
it to her myself, if i could.

159
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,077
It's adorable. Thank you so much.

160
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,800
It suits her.

161
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,109
I have to keep her in here,

162
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,347
'Cause my dad's not
crazy about cats.

163
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,340
How's your dad doing? He seemed-

164
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:15,347
Moody?

165
00:09:15,574 --> 00:09:17,228
Right.

166
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,580
He's been doin' pretty
well since my mom died.

167
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:22,115
What was her name?

168
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:24,825
Liz. Short for lisbeth.

169
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,370
She hated being called lisbeth.

170
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,510
Must be hard for you,

171
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,425
Moving and all, not knowing anyone.

172
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,905
She got me.

173
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:46,837
What?

174
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,450
My mom.

175
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,120
She-She got me.

176
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,075
She was the only one.

177
00:09:57,627 --> 00:09:58,727
Well, i'm sure your father-

178
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,374
I know.

179
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,667
But not like her.

180
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,570
Now i don't think
anybody ever will.

181
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,245
Sometimes i think he
blames me for what happened.

182
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,205
What happened?

183
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,451
Where's dora?

184
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:29,280
I hope she didn't
go in my dad's room.

185
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,660
Hang on.

186
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,673
Liz?

187
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,310
What happened?

188
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,599
The cat, it died.

189
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,895
What did you do to her?

190
00:10:57,434 --> 00:10:59,245
I didn't do anything to her.

191
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,325
I just found her like that.

192
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:04,278
Might have been some
rat poison or something.

193
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,585
I'm sorry, honey.

194
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,685
Steve, are you ok?

195
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,259
Yeah.

196
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,204
She sure did like that cat.

197
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:35,289
Yeah?

198
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:38,033
Hey. Steve. I'm so
sorry to bug you,

199
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:40,823
But i just thought i could walk
you through these county tax...

200
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,580
Rebate forms.

201
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,259
You know, it's a great program,

202
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,540
Especially if you plan on
putting any money into the place.

203
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,031
What's wrong with the place?

204
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:53,104
Well, you know. I
mean, whatever you do

205
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:54,670
For improvements, things like that.

206
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,061
I like the place
just the way it is.

207
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,124
Ok. Well, then, um, i could just-

208
00:11:59,125 --> 00:11:59,925
Just forget it.

209
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,078
If it makes life easier,
he's not interested.

210
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,780
Yeah, well, you're the
expert on easy livin'.

211
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,367
Never do today what you can
put off till tomorrow, right?

212
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,019
What are you saying? I'm lazy?

213
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:10,500
You didn't think i was lazy

214
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:12,885
When certain things had to
be done to a certain person.

215
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,650
I should have stopped you.

216
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,185
That's easy to say now,

217
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,663
But you had too much
to gain, didn't you?

218
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:21,315
As long as i was doing it, you
weren't gonna stand in my way.

219
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,730
You know, it looks like
i came at a bad time,

220
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:26,967
So i'm just gonna
leave these over here.

221
00:12:26,968 --> 00:12:28,445
Bad time for what?

222
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,355
Um, to sign the tax rebate form.

223
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,629
It's ok. I can just leave it.

224
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:34,920
If i sign it, will you
get the hell out of here?

225
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,070
Um, yeah.

226
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,803
It was like they were
2 different people.

227
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,037
It was so eerie.

228
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:55,865
Like they were in a trance?

229
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,738
Yeah, exactly. And
they kept talking about

230
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:00,167
Having done something to somebody,

231
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:05,019
And marlo said that her dad had
too much to gain to stop her. Weird.

232
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:07,250
Could they have been
talking about marlo's mother?

233
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:12,336
Well, why would you think steve would have
done something to the mother of his child?

234
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,620
Because of this.

235
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,650
"Liz sinclair, 36,
of oak hills died

236
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:19,207
"In a fatal fall
from a hiking trail

237
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,355
"In the northwest section
of ryden state park.

238
00:13:21,454 --> 00:13:24,410
"Her hiking companions,
husband steven sinclair, 37,

239
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:27,310
"And daughter marlo,
15, were unharmed.

240
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,750
"Sinclair was questioned
late into the night

241
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:32,107
"By the county sheriff and
released the next morning.

242
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,676
Officials would make
no further comment. "

243
00:13:33,677 --> 00:13:34,834
Yeah. Well, obviously
they let him go.

244
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,837
Yeah, which only means
they had no proof.

245
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,865
I mean, it could explain
why liz is haunting him.

246
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,116
Then again, marlo did
say that steve blames her.

247
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,017
Maybe she's haunting marlo.

248
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,500
Wait, wait, wait. Just hold on.

249
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,854
Did you say anything

250
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:47,120
The last time you were there
about ghosts or hauntings?

251
00:13:47,121 --> 00:13:48,100
No.

252
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:49,318
Are you sure?

253
00:13:49,554 --> 00:13:50,880
Yeah, of course i'm sure. Why?

254
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:52,621
I don't know. Maybe it's like

255
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:53,954
Power of suggestion, you know?

256
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,081
They think they're haunted,

257
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:56,520
So then they just
start acting like it.

258
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:57,914
Ok, i love you

259
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,221
Like a sister, really, i do,

260
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:02,530
But you are the
most stubborn person

261
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:03,856
I have met in my entire life.

262
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:06,048
I mean, you will twist
yourself up into a pretzel

263
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,209
Trying to rationalize some-

264
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,069
I'm sorry, i'm just looking for
a logical reason for them to-

265
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,059
Oh, you mean the believable
reason, not the real reason,

266
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,677
But the easy reason.

267
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,064
Whatever makes you comfortable.

268
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,237
Let me get this straight.

269
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,900
Daddy and daughter move to the
country to get away from it all.

270
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:29,190
There's a ghost in the
garage that predicts

271
00:14:29,193 --> 00:14:30,876
That one of them will be dead soon.

272
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:32,626
The cat turns up
somewhat less than alive,

273
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:35,900
And daddy buries it like it's
just another day of yardwork.

274
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:36,800
And this morning...

275
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:38,380
And this morning, delia
goes over to the house

276
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:40,873
And finds herself in the middle
of who's afraid of virginia woolf?

277
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:41,820
What are you doing?

278
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,803
Oh. I'm, uh-I'm trying

279
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:46,271
A radical new technique
to my class lectures.

280
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:47,830
What? Preparation.

281
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,556
Ok, so what am i looking
at with this ghost?

282
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,960
You're looking at, uh...

283
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,375
A little more jack nicholson,
little less linda blair.

284
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,433
Meaning?

285
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:57,944
Meaning it's not like there's a
demon taking over their bodies.

286
00:14:57,945 --> 00:15:00,900
It sounds like there's a spirit
influencing them from the outside,

287
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:03,311
Controlling their
behavior from time to time.

288
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:04,650
It's called "oppression. "

289
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:06,181
You mean "possession. "

290
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:08,700
No. I say what i mean. I
mean what i say, damn it.

291
00:15:08,702 --> 00:15:10,095
I said, "oppression. "

292
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,208
Ok, oppression. Sorry.
Never heard of it.

293
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,823
Basically it's when a
spirit controls a body

294
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:17,730
Without ever entering inside of it.

295
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,762
It's a bit like
hypnotic suggestion.

296
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:22,509
In essence, it directs how
it wants the body to behave,

297
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:23,900
And what's really
creepy is over time,

298
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:26,415
The person begins to act
more and more like that ghost.

299
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,334
It's possession lite, if you will.

300
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,307
It's all the bad manners
with half the head-Spinning.

301
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,825
Ok, so why not go
full-On possession?

302
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,989
Ah, possession, that's
a tool used by demons,

303
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,100
Spirits that never walked
the earth in human form,

304
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,976
Whereas oppression these are-These
are used by earthbound spirits,

305
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,796
Earthbound spirits
that are very stubborn

306
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,450
And will do whatever it
takes to get what they want.

307
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:45,440
Which is?

308
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,607
That's for the ghost to
know and for you to find out.

309
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,942
Ok, so how do i get the ghost
to stop, to leave them alone?

310
00:15:49,943 --> 00:15:53,421
That's hard to say. I'm not
sure, but i do know this.

311
00:15:53,422 --> 00:15:55,131
You have to be careful,
because an oppressive spirit

312
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:58,500
They will really take
advantage of any weakness,

313
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:00,570
Any vulnerability
that their host has-

314
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:02,429
A mental illness,
emotional turmoil.

315
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,796
Turmoil like, "i killed a loved
one"? That kind of turmoil?

316
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,473
Oh. Ok, i was thinking more
like white slacks in november,

317
00:16:09,474 --> 00:16:11,253
But sure, that would work also.

318
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,770
Steve?

319
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,955
Hey. Uh, i-I'm sorry that
i didn't call first. I just-

320
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,467
You play from your
head, not your heart.

321
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:03,884
That's why you lose.

322
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,937
I don't always lose.

323
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:09,270
Sometimes just let you win.

324
00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:10,610
Why?

325
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,330
Mess with your head a little bit,

326
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,040
False confidence
- Things like that.

327
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,130
Heh. You think i'm
falsely confident?

328
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,575
Why don't you make yourself
useful and go get me a drink?

329
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,465
Good idea.

330
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,140
Liz?

331
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,737
Stop it!

332
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,920
You're not liz
sinclair. Who are you?

333
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,324
You see me, don't you?

334
00:17:42,325 --> 00:17:43,092
Leave them alone.

335
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,165
Matt, we have more company.

336
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,080
Whoa. It's scary when they
look right at you like that.

337
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,613
Marlo, look, i don't
know if you can hear me,

338
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:02,700
But you're being used.

339
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:06,590
I- I know that you can't see
them, but you- You can feel them.

340
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,712
Steve, please listen to me, ok?

341
00:18:09,717 --> 00:18:11,055
You don't know what's happening.

342
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,250
Both of you get out of
this house right now!

343
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,383
Steve.

344
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,360
What did you do?

345
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,800
My daughter.

346
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,590
Where's my daughter?

347
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,725
She right here. She's fine.

348
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,810
She's goin' with you.

349
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,450
Hey, stay with these 2 guys.

350
00:18:49,455 --> 00:18:50,556
They'll take care
of you, all right?

351
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,900
You're playing too rough.

352
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,800
You're gonna break them
like you broke the others.

353
00:19:00,804 --> 00:19:02,039
You're just a sore loser.

354
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,000
No, i am not.

355
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:05,277
It's just that these two
are too perfect to lose.

356
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,262
I mean, all that guilt, i
can practically taste it.

357
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,192
What the hell are you two doing?

358
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,464
Sorry. It's a private game.

359
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,284
Oh, is that what this is? You just
play with them like they're toys?

360
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:17,920
None of your business. Buh-Bye.

361
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,325
Melinda.

362
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,020
Is he gonna be all right?

363
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,200
Zenorex prescribed
to steven sinclair.

364
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:26,934
Yeah, this is good news, actually.

365
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,281
It's an antidepressant.

366
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,345
He'd have to take a lot
of these to be fatal.

367
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,969
This guy just try to kill himself?

368
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,785
His daughter put it in his drink.

369
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,700
What? It wasn't really her, ok?

370
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:38,749
There's 2 ghosts in the house,
and they're trying to control them.

371
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,243
Wait. There are 2 ghosts
- What, they're possessed?

372
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:43,643
It's called oppression. They lived
here before. It's a long story.

373
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:46,000
Wait. You always say houses
aren't haunted, people-

374
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:47,711
Ok, just
- All right.

375
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,551
Well, do we call the cops?

376
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,541
Not yet. As long as they're
out of the house, they're safe,

377
00:19:52,545 --> 00:19:53,800
And they don't even
remember what happened.

378
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:56,545
I just can't let this little
girl get taken away from her dad.

379
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,500
All right.

380
00:19:57,503 --> 00:19:58,965
Ok, will you just keep
an eye on him for me?

381
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,355
I'll do what i can,

382
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,450
But i think they're only
gonna keep steven overnight.

383
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:04,518
I have to figure out who these
ghosts are and what they want.

384
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,453
Right.

385
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,486
Hey. Yeah?

386
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:08,220
You call me if anything changes?

387
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:09,167
You know it.

388
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,400
It was a man and a woman.

389
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:17,972
The woman is slightly
older than him.

390
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:19,544
It's not marlo's mother?

391
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,173
No. I don't think they're
connected to the family at all.

392
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:23,540
They might be
connected to the house.

393
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:25,600
But i thought you said places
aren't haunted, and people are.

394
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:26,460
All right, shush.

395
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,300
Hey, wait a minute.
You got steve and marlo

396
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:31,800
Out of the house.
That's a positive thing.

397
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:34,870
Except for the fact that marlo
practically killed her father.

398
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,583
Less positive, i admit.

399
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,489
Look, these oppressive ghosts, they're
stubborn. They're very powerful.

400
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,043
Powerful enough to survive
more than one owner,

401
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:43,534
Which is probably why the house
is haunted, and not the people.

402
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:45,910
Touché. All right.

403
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:49,746
So you said that these ghosts are treating
it all like it's some kind of a game?

404
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:51,070
Yeah. Like a contest.

405
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,320
What is it, the newlydead game?

406
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,265
That was good. I just made that up.

407
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,170
All right, what's the
point of their game,

408
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:58,776
Last ghost out of the house wins?

409
00:20:58,777 --> 00:21:01,300
Last man standing. Steve and
marlo are the game pieces.

410
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,015
Why don't you just figure
out what their names are,

411
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,374
Figure out how to play, and
beat them at their own game

412
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,535
And get them to cross over?

413
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,020
Don't make it sound so easy.

414
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,570
Maybe i already have a name.

415
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,831
You said that steve
signed a tax form-Sorry.

416
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:16,260
He did? Oh, there you are.

417
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,230
When you went down
there. Can i see it?

418
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,139
Uh, why? Why-Why do you need to?

419
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,313
Please. I just need to see it.

420
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:25,183
Is it something
about his handwriting?

421
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,140
Okget ready to think
of a rational reason.

422
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,050
For what?

423
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,597
Why steve sinclair signed his
name as "matthew sembrook. "

424
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,464
You know, i don't get it.

425
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:45,336
Why would steve sign
somebody else's name?

426
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,400
Because that's who he thinks he is.

427
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:48,564
Here. Look.

428
00:21:48,565 --> 00:21:51,755
"Matthew sembrook with father
erwin and mother vivian. "

429
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,370
Mother? She looks 10
years older than him.

430
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,921
Matt is erwin's son
from a previous marriage.

431
00:21:56,926 --> 00:21:58,370
He was vivian's stepson.

432
00:21:58,371 --> 00:22:01,579
It says here that matthew and
vivian died of natural gas poisoning.

433
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,715
What happened to erwin
sembrook? Where's he?

434
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,734
Dead, 6 months before.

435
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:09,511
Apparently, erwin died in an accident
shortly after marrying vivian,

436
00:22:09,515 --> 00:22:12,031
So mother and son inherited
the house and the fortune.

437
00:22:12,255 --> 00:22:14,910
So you're saying that these two,

438
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,900
Matthew and vivian, are
haunting the sinclairs?

439
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:21,010
Not only haunting them,
but controlling them,

440
00:22:21,011 --> 00:22:23,300
Which i'm sure is what they did with
everyone else who lived in that house.

441
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,900
Well, their death, what happened?

442
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:29,000
Was it an accident, a suicide?

443
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
What does the article say?

444
00:22:30,206 --> 00:22:33,120
Well, it says here that there
are unanswered questions.

445
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:35,140
Well, is there something
i can do to help?

446
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,427
Would you really want to?

447
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:41,880
Look. You're right.

448
00:22:42,173 --> 00:22:43,440
I don't know why,

449
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,400
But there is just some default
switch that goes off inside my head,

450
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:50,566
And it always resets
to "that can't be. "

451
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,363
Well, maybe it can be.

452
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,756
Ok.

453
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,615
Maybe it can.

454
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,273
I just don't want to
feel like i'm hurting you

455
00:23:01,275 --> 00:23:02,600
Every time that i question it.

456
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,078
It has nothing to
do with hurting me.

457
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,296
I just hate to see
you so closed off.

458
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,929
I mean, there are tons of things
in life that we take on faith,

459
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,235
That we can't see. Why can't
you do that with spirits?

460
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,444
I can.

461
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,100
I will.

462
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:24,355
I'm gonna try.

463
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,260
But if i can't-

464
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,500
I'm sorry.

465
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,700
Jim.

466
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,600
Mel, steve's being released
from the hospital tonight.

467
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:34,427
He's signing himself
out, goin' home.

468
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:41,377
I know who you are.

469
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,685
Matthew and vivian sembrook.

470
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,550
You like to play games?

471
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:55,460
So do i.

472
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,317
Let's see how you do with
someone you don't control.

473
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,840
Not so easy keeping up the energy

474
00:24:06,843 --> 00:24:08,370
When the sinclairs are gone, is it?

475
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,570
Oh, you'll do.

476
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,644
You both need to cross over.

477
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,425
No, thanks. We're good here.

478
00:24:14,616 --> 00:24:16,976
Ok. Then i'll play you for it.

479
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,782
For what?

480
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:21,535
A crossover.

481
00:24:21,935 --> 00:24:23,094
20 questions.

482
00:24:23,401 --> 00:24:25,735
If i can tell you what
happened when you lived here,

483
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,830
Then you have to cross over.

484
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,405
And if you don't guess?

485
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,260
I'll never bother you again.

486
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,460
Really? That is so stupid.

487
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,967
You don't bothers at all.

488
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,855
You mean nothing to us.

489
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,707
I like it.

490
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,570
Let's do it.

491
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:47,350
What were you doing when i
first saw you in the garage?

492
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,840
I never saw you in the garage.

493
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:51,396
Are you sure you want to
count that as a question?

494
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,955
Your late huand died in
this house, didn't he?

495
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,530
Yes.

496
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,669
And you were both here that night?

497
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,120
Yes.

498
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,130
And you feel guilty
about what happened?

499
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,280
Just like you feel guilty
about a few things, don't you?

500
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,970
About someone in particular, maybe?

501
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:07,656
I'm asking the questions.

502
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,567
That's right, andrea, you are.

503
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:10,955
What?

504
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,886
I'm sorry. Did i call you
by someone else's name?

505
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,393
Did you kill your husband?

506
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,707
You want to know what
happened that night?

507
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,407
Come.

508
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,040
Vivian, mathew, are you up ther?

509
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,645
How can you do this?

510
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,164
He's my son!

511
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,517
He's not my son.

512
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,573
He does something you never do,

513
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:06,760
Pays attention to me.

514
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,184
Vivian, wait.

515
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:13,127
And you! What kind
of a man are you?

516
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,097
A man raised by you.

517
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,765
Don't you turn your back on me!

518
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,351
Look, it was an accident.

519
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:30,210
Ok, i just saw it.
He missed a step,

520
00:26:30,212 --> 00:26:31,875
So you don't have
to blame yourself.

521
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,950
You guys can forgive each other.

522
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,127
And your dad, he's gonna
be in the light, ok?

523
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,129
He'll forgive you.

524
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,880
Wow. She did it.

525
00:26:41,197 --> 00:26:42,690
She wins the game.

526
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:47,330
So now you can cross over

527
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:48,720
And you can leave
the sinclairs alone.

528
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:53,505
Wait. There was one more thing.

529
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,575
Why?

530
00:27:10,383 --> 00:27:11,870
Why?

531
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:31,473
Stop it!

532
00:27:36,216 --> 00:27:37,316
You killed him.

533
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,440
Yeah, sorry. It's just that...

534
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,053
Well, we're really
not very nice people.

535
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,200
Melinda, what-What are
you still doing here?

536
00:27:56,201 --> 00:27:58,467
I'll explain later, ok, but
we have to get out ofere.

537
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,200
Now, you can just come a
- And stay with me,

538
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:02,420
But you have to get out
of this house right now.

539
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:04,910
Ok, let's go.

540
00:28:05,336 --> 00:28:06,000
Ok.

541
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:11,537
Don't be a sore loser.

542
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,335
And leave us the hell alone.

543
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,470
Steve, please don't do this.

544
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,655
Who are you?

545
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,175
Are you liz sinclair?

546
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,665
Are matt and vivian stopping
you from going in the house?

547
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:10,250
I'm too weak.

548
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:12,893
They're too strong for me.

549
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,503
They're only strong
'cause they've spent years

550
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:16,337
Feeding off of other people's fear,

551
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,545
Playing their little games.

552
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,771
Did steve cause your death?

553
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:24,157
Yes.

554
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,235
But he had to.

555
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:28,900
Why?

556
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,923
The alternative would
have been even worse.

557
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,900
I think that steve's guilt

558
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,935
Is what's allowing matt and vivian
to have so much power over them.

559
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,520
It's not just steve's guilt.

560
00:29:41,682 --> 00:29:43,255
What?

561
00:29:43,517 --> 00:29:45,500
It's marlo, too.

562
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,020
He will always blame you.

563
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,690
Every time he looks at
you, he sees his dead wife.

564
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,350
Do you know what that does to him?

565
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:09,785
There's really only
one way to end this,

566
00:30:10,737 --> 00:30:13,050
All this pain, all this anger.

567
00:30:14,156 --> 00:30:15,406
You know what it is.

568
00:30:17,223 --> 00:30:18,673
You know what you have to do

569
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,220
For your own protection.

570
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,536
You know what you have to do

571
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,380
To make sure you both get peace.

572
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,500
It's the best thing
for both of you.

573
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:20,310
It only hurts for a
second. You'll barely know,

574
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,482
And then you'll both
finally have some peace.

575
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:24,709
Don't listen to her.
Ok, this is not you.

576
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,169
This is a ghost that's
making you feel these things.

577
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,240
What?

578
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,413
This is what you do, isn't it?

579
00:31:30,217 --> 00:31:32,200
You just play your story
over and over again,

580
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:33,584
Except it's a new person each te,

581
00:31:33,706 --> 00:31:34,715
But your real story

582
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,365
Is that you were so guilty
about killing your husband

583
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,430
That you killed yourselves.

584
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,900
Looks and brains. I'm impressed.

585
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,230
The newspapers keep saying that
it's-It's poisoning from natural gas.

586
00:31:45,902 --> 00:31:47,625
It's a little more complicated
than that, isn't it?

587
00:31:48,685 --> 00:31:49,315
A bit.

588
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,046
And it wasn't about guilt either.

589
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:08,833
The thing is matt and i always
thought we were a perfect match,

590
00:32:08,835 --> 00:32:11,805
Because neither one of us
had a shred of conscience.

591
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:13,393
Oh, it was just delicious.

592
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,985
The problem is that when you realize the
man you love is as dangerous as you are...

593
00:32:32,713 --> 00:32:34,162
Let's just say it's
not a trust builder.

594
00:32:35,446 --> 00:32:37,255
Attraction turns to suspicion.

595
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,610
There was a lot of money at stake.

596
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,900
Erwin had left us
both very well off.

597
00:32:44,483 --> 00:32:45,799
So i started to wonder

598
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,025
Was matthew's devotion real,

599
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,907
Or did he really want
all that money to himself,

600
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,495
And what would he be willing to do?

601
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,745
He already knew what
i was willing to do,

602
00:32:59,347 --> 00:33:01,310
And i'm sure he was having
the same thoughts about me.

603
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,706
Which is why i decided

604
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,400
That the best thing
for our relationship

605
00:33:06,407 --> 00:33:10,395
Was for matt to have a
tragic, careless accident.

606
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,473
Control freak that i am, i wanted
to make sure that he fell asleep,

607
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:18,215
As it were, before
i left the house.

608
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:20,140
He was always so restless.

609
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:24,735
Imagine my surprise when i
fell asleep before he did.

610
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:28,217
Very sneaky stuff, natural gas.

611
00:33:28,734 --> 00:33:31,607
Turns out i was much more
sensitive to it than he was.

612
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:34,330
Of course, matt
followed soon after.

613
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,020
Then we woke up, and we were dead,

614
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,664
And we've been here
having a blast ever since.

615
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,355
What? What is going on?

616
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,360
I'm gonna get you out
of this house right now.

617
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,440
We'll get your father.

618
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,456
I vote for my guy. He's
gonna go all the way.

619
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
You should have behaved.

620
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,840
What are you going to do?

621
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,434
Don't count my girl out.

622
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:19,710
Both of you just stop it.

623
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:22,454
This is family business.

624
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,195
You should have left us alone.

625
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,000
Too late now.

626
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,400
Steve, please stop, ok?

627
00:34:35,401 --> 00:34:37,370
I've seen your wife.
I've seen her spirit.

628
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,740
My wife is dead.

629
00:34:38,934 --> 00:34:39,815
You should know.

630
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:42,407
You killed her. Me?

631
00:34:43,033 --> 00:34:45,029
If it wasn't for you,
she'd still be alive.

632
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,220
You let go!

633
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:47,560
You didn't listen to me!

634
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,396
Now that's entertainment.

635
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,050
Come on. Come on.

636
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,020
What's happening?

637
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,930
Just trust me. I'm
taking you to your mother.

638
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,094
Wait, waitwait!

639
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,256
What are you-What are
you saying about my mom?

640
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,472
Tell her i'm sorry that
it's been so hard on them.

641
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:14,220
Your mom is here with us.

642
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,167
I can see her.

643
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,200
Tell her i miss our nightly ritual

644
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:22,541
Of brushing each other's hair,

645
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,115
Her beautiful hair that she
got from her grandmother.

646
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:28,330
She misses brushing
each other's hair.

647
00:35:32,986 --> 00:35:37,120
Dad, uh, she says mom's here,

648
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,053
Her-Her spirit or-Or
ghost or something,

649
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,388
And she wants to help.

650
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,485
What-What are you talking about?

651
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,588
That shirt he's
wearing is my favorite,

652
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:47,623
Because he wore it
when marlo was born.

653
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,034
She remembers your shirt.

654
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,980
You were wearing it the
day that marlo was born.

655
00:35:55,063 --> 00:35:56,296
She said that?

656
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:01,450
She's really here?

657
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:06,430
They have to stop
punishing themselves.

658
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,629
She wants you to stop
punishing each other.

659
00:36:16,016 --> 00:36:17,455
I'm so sorry, mom.

660
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:22,016
Dad's right. If it wasn't for me, i
- No.

661
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,584
It's all my fault, and-

662
00:36:23,585 --> 00:36:24,460
No. It was me.

663
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:27,699
It was me.

664
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,880
I made the decision. It was me.

665
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,545
What happened that day?

666
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,286
We were so tired.

667
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,844
We'd been on that trail all day.

668
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,250
Watch my moves.

669
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,393
Oh. Hey, look!

670
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,630
It happened so fast.

671
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,367
Aah! Liz!

672
00:36:58,234 --> 00:36:59,380
No!

673
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,420
One second, she was next to me.

674
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:08,046
The next, she was
hanging off a cliff.

675
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,488
I was trying to pull her up,
but i couldn't get any traction.

676
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,800
Mom! No!

677
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,525
Dad! Stay there!

678
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,600
And that's when it all fell apart.

679
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,265
I knew i couldn't stop marlo.

680
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,950
How can you stop a child from
trying to save her mother?

681
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,000
Mom! Aah!

682
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,460
Marlo was falling.

683
00:37:46,217 --> 00:37:47,545
She was gonna die.

684
00:37:48,051 --> 00:37:50,654
I couldn't get liz
back on the ledge.

685
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,625
I thought there was
only one way to save her.

686
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:10,974
I let go of liz,

687
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,648
And i grabbed ahold of marlo.

688
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,636
Mom! Liz!

689
00:38:22,549 --> 00:38:23,920
I'm so sorry.

690
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,900
I should have tried
to save you both.

691
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,900
No. No, he couldn't.

692
00:38:30,904 --> 00:38:32,200
He did what i wanted him to do,

693
00:38:32,204 --> 00:38:33,600
The only thing that he could do.

694
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,000
You did everything that
she wanted you to do.

695
00:38:37,005 --> 00:38:37,875
You saved marlo.

696
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,550
And i know you were
trying to save me.

697
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:52,495
She risked her life for me.

698
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,566
She doesn't blame you.

699
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,395
She was really proud of you.

700
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,365
I'm so sorry, mom.

701
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,665
I don't know how to do
any of this without you.

702
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,460
You will always have me
with you in your heart,

703
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,915
But most importantly,
you have each other.

704
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,445
They've gotta stop
punishing themselves.

705
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,335
Please tell them that
we'll always be a family,

706
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,505
And they have to take
care of each other.

707
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,415
I will.

708
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,098
I have to go now.

709
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,285
She crossed over.

710
00:39:53,473 --> 00:39:54,470
Is she gonna be ok?

711
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,785
She was smiling, at peace.

712
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,880
She's always gonna
be in your heart.

713
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,475
How come i don't feel anything
bad when i go inside now?

714
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,955
They can't feed off your
guilt anymore. They're weak.

715
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,885
How can i sell this house to
somebody knowing what i know?

716
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,917
I'll come back, cross them over.

717
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,000
Don't worry about it. You
two just get a fresh start.

718
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,840
I cannot thank you enough.

719
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,155
Me, too.

720
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,200
Things'll get better
now. You'll see.

721
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,900
Would you mind checking
marlo into the hotel?

722
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:44,300
I just need to grab
a few more things.

723
00:40:44,305 --> 00:40:45,200
Sure. Come on.

724
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,065
Only one way to be sure
things'll get better.

725
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:09,645
Well played.

726
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,305
My dad!

727
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,389
Fresh start.

728
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,300
Hi, mel.

729
00:42:10,304 --> 00:42:13,485
Jim, you'd better get the fire
department to the sinclair house.

730
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,655
Steve did the only thing
he thought he could do.

731
00:42:16,004 --> 00:42:17,220
What will we do?

732
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,780
What if nobody else comes?

733
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:23,800
This is our home, the-The
place where we met.

734
00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:24,400
We can't leave.

735
00:42:24,402 --> 00:42:25,995
Don't worry. Somebody always comes.

736
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,725
They'll build.
They'll buy and sell.

737
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,219
All we have to do is wait.

738
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,280
What do we do in the meantime?

739
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,474
How 'bout a game?

740
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,500
20 questions?

741
00:42:38,505 --> 00:42:39,220
You're on.

742
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:42,500
Ok. Oh, i got a good one.
