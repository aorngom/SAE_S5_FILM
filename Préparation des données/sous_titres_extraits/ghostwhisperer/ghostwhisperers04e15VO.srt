00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,700
PREVIOUSLY ON
GHOST WHISPERER...

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,000
- NO!
- I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU MELINDA.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:06,900
NOT YOU.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,500
YOU HAVE TO CROSS OVER.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,800
I DON'T WANT TO.

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,100
THEY DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, I SAW
JIM'S GHOST STEP INTO SAM'S BODY.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,300
YOU'RE BACK!

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,500
DO I KNOW YOU?

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,400
I SEE THE SAME GUY
THAT YOU SEE. 

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,400
IT'S NOT JIM.

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,700
I JUST KNOW WHAT I SEE
WHEN I LOOK IN THOSE EYES.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,500
AND JIM IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,300
WAIT. YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TELL ME THAT YOU THINK

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,600
I'M YOUR HUSBAND REINCARNATED.

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,800
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO
CAN SEE ME. PLEASE HELP.

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,500
IS SOMETHING THERE?

17
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,900
SORRY AGAIN FOR BEING
SO DISTRACTED.

18
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,000
WHERE'S SHE ALWAYS
RUNNING OFF TO?

19
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,400
WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT IS
GOING ON BETWEEN US?

20
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,700
LOOK. I KNOW
WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

21
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,300
WHAT? 

22
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,200
THAT YOU'RE NOT
READY TO START DATING YET--

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,000
GET UP NOW! GET OUT OF BED!
NOW, NOW, NOW!

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,200
COME ON, MOVE ON.
GET OUT OF BED. LET'S GO!

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,900
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,500
LET'S GO NOW!
NOW! GET UP!

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:17,800
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,900
SHUT UP. MOVE IT.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,600
COME ON.

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,800
LINE 'EM UP!

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,500
COME ON, LET'S GO.

32
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,200
FACE ME. STAY.

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,900
YOU MAY LEAVE NOW, BROTHERS.

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,000
TONIGHT YOUR LIVES
WILL CHANGE FOREVER.

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,500
IF YOU WAIVER OR SHOW ANY SIGN
OF WEAKNESS, 

36
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,800
YOU WON'T SURVIVE.

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,900
THE BAGS OVER YOUR HEADS MAKE YOU
NAMELESS AND FACELESS IN OUR EYES.

38
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,400
ONLY THOSE OF YOU WHO PROVE
YOURWORTH WILL BECOME SISTERS.

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,200
UNTIL THEN...

40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,200
YOU'RE NOTHING.

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,500
SCISSORS.

42
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,000
NOW THAT WE'VE RESTORED
YOUR SIGHT,

43
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,000
YOUR MISSION IS TO EACH
RETRIEVE ONE TOKEN--

44
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,400
A SYMBOL FROM
THE SIGMA THETA CHI CREST.

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,100
THE SERPENT, THE GOLDEN DAGGER,

46
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,300
THE ORB, AND THE RAVEN.

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,100
YOU'LL BE GIVEN SEPARATE
INSTRUCTIONS.

48
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
ONCE YOU'VE FOUND YOUR TOKEN,

49
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,000
YOU MUST FOLLOW THE MAP'S DIRECTIONS
TO YOUR ASSIGNED LOCATIONS.

50
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,100
HERE'S A MAP WITH
DIRECTIONS. DON'T LOSE IT.

51
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,900
IF YOU DISOBEY BY JOING FORCES

52
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,300
OR SEEK TO LESSEN YOUR BURDEN
BY REMOVING YOUR HEAD COVERING,

53
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,700
YOU WILL BE ELIMINATED.
WE'RE WATCHING YOU.

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,900
THESE WOODS HAVE EYES.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,200
AND KNOW THAT IF YOU EVER
BREATHE A WORD OF THIS TO ANYONE,

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,400
YOU WILL FOREVER BE BANNED
FROM THE SISTERHOOD.

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,000
YOU HAVE UNTIL
THE SUN RISES IN 4 HOURS.

58
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,500
IF YOU COME UPON A NOOSE,

59
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,100
KNOW IT'S THE PLACE WHERE
OTHERS HAVE FAILEDORFALLEN.

60
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,100
DON'T TOUCH IT. LOOK AWAY.

61
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,500
AND RUN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.
AND PRAY NO ONE FOLLOWS.

62
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,600
NOT YOU, COURTNEY.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,500
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DROP OUT
NOW AND SAVE US ALL THE TIME?

64
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,500
TIE YOUR SHOES. GATHER
YOUR WITS. TIME IS TICKING.

65
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,300
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,000
SHOW US YOU'RE WORTHY,
OR YOU'RE OUT.

67
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,900
FAILURE IS NOT TOLERATED.

68
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,700
GET MOVING, NOW!

69
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,000
DID YOU PLANT THE NOOSES?

70
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

71
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,700
OH, GOD, WHERE AM I?

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,100
HELLO? WHO'S THERE?
IS ANYBODY THERE?

73
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,800
OK. I DON'T NEED
TO HEAR THE GORY DETAILS...

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,200
JUST YET.

75
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,200
IT'S GOOD. OK?
WE'RE HAVING A GREAT TIME.

76
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
AND WE HAD BREAKFAST TOGETHER
AGAIN THIS MORNING.

77
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT YOU...

78
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,400
WERE HERE DOING INVENTORY.

79
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,400
WITH SAM?

80
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,700
NO, ALONE.

81
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,400
WHAT?

82
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,000
YOU'VE DONE INVENTORY THE
3 TIMES. OK? IT WAS MY TURN.

83
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,500
OK. LET'S JUST BE
CLEAR HERE. SAM FIRST.

84
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,900
GHOSTS SECOND.

85
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,300
AND THE STORE...YOU KNOW,
WE'LL FIGURE THAT OUT.

86
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,900
WELL, THANK YOU. BUT I HAVE
RESPONSIBILITIES TO YOU AND TO THEM.

87
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,600
GHOSTS DO NOT TAKE SICK DAYS
JUST BECAUSE I'M DATING.

88
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,400
MORNING.

89
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,600
HEY. I THOUGHT I'D BRING
YOU GUYS A LITTLE JOLT.

90
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,700
THAT'S NICE OF YOU.

91
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,400
YEAH. THAT'S PERFECT.

92
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,600
- HERE, DELIA.
- THANKS.

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,100
I'M GONNA GO OVER HERE.

94
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,900
HEY, LOOK. I'VE GOT TO GO AND DO
A BID FOR A CONTRACTOR TONIGHT,

95
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,100
BUT I WAS WONDERING WHAT
YOUR AFTERNOON'S LOOKING LIKE.

96
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,400
I'LL COVER FOR YA.

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,400
WELL THAT'S NICE OF YOU.

98
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,800
I KNOW IT'S TOTALLY
OUT OF THE BLUE,

99
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,700
BUT I WAS THINKING, YOU KNOW,

100
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,400
YOU'RE NOT REALLY A PLANNING
AHEAD KINDA PERSON, RIGHT?

101
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,000
I KNOW, I'M SORRY.

102
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,500
NO, YOU'RE BUSY. I GET IT.

103
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,400
BUT, I GOT THIS INVITE
TO THIS ART OPENING.

104
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,400
AND ARE YOU INTO ART?

105
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,100
SURE.

106
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
I THINK I USED TO BE, TOO.

107
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,500
I'M ON THE EMAIL LIST
OF THIS ARTIST.

108
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,600
AND APPARENTLY I EVEN BOUGHT
SOMETHING FROM HIM.

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,400
THEY SAY HE'S
THE NEXT RODNEY SABLE.

110
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,300
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.

111
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,300
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW EITHER.

112
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,300
I DON'T KNOW. SOME UP-AND-COMING
ARTIST, RIGHT?

113
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,200
UM, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

114
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,200
YES.

115
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,000
- I MEAN, SHE CAN COVER.
- I'LL COVER...

116
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,600
- FOR HER.
- FOR ME.

117
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,300
GOOD.

118
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,200
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
- BUT IF YOU NEED TO CANCEL.
- NO, I WON'T.

120
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,400
UM, STARTS AT 2:00.

121
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,600
PERFECT.

122
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
See you at 2:00.

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,800
WHAT? I SAID "YES."

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,700
AND WHAT DO YOU SAY
IF YOU SEE A GHOST?

125
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,900
NO, THANK YOU.

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,900
EXACTLY.

127
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,300
OHH, IF ONLY
IT WERE THAT EASY.

128
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,900
HEY, DID YOU SIGN MY COPY?

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,100
HOT OFF THE PRESS.

130
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,300
LET ME SEE!
LET ME SEE!

131
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,800
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU RUSHED OVER HERE.

132
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,100
THE BOOKSTORE SOLD OUT
ALREADY.

133
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,700
ALL TO MY MOM, BUT STILL.

134
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,400
??

135
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,700
MAKING THE BOND,
BREAKING THE FEAR

136
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,900
ELI JAMES, PhD."THIS IS SO COOL.

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
YOU KNOW THAT JIM AND I
WERE YOUR INSPIRATION.

138
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,600
YEAH, I WROTE THE ENTIRE
BOOK BASED ON YOU TWO.

139
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,800
NO, THE THREE OF YOU.
ARE WE COUNTING SAM?

140
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,500
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
SINCE YOU BROUGHT IT UP--

141
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,100
YOU MAY WANT TO READ
A COUPLE OF CHAPTERS.

142
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,200
LEARN A FEW THINGS ABOUT
PRIORITIZING YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

143
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,500
DID DELIA CALL YOU?

144
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,000
YES.

145
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,500
DID SHE CALL IT A RELATIONSHIP?

146
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,600
YES. WHICH UNDER ANY OTHER
CIRCUMSTANCES I WOULD CALL FAST.

147
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,100
NOT YOU. YOU'RE SLOW.
MAKING THE POOR GUY WAIT.

148
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,300
OH NO.

149
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,000
WHAT?

150
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,400
THAT POOR GHOST,
AND I HAVE A DATE.

151
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,500
AND I PROMISED DELIA
NO GHOST STUFF.

152
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,700
OK. SOME OF US AREN'T
BLESSED WITH GHOST VISION.

153
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,700
CAN YOU MAKE IT TALK?

154
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,900
THAT MIGHT BE A HARD.
SHE HAS A BAG OVER HER HEAD.

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,500
WHAT ELSE?

156
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,700
UH...A BLACK SLIP AND SNEAKERS.
NOTHING ELSE.

157
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,700
GOOD TIMES.

158
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,300
LOOK. WHY DON'T YOU GO TALK
TO HER AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS?

159
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,300
ME?! I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHERE SHE IS. YOU GO!

160
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,900
YOU LOOKING FOR SOMEONE? 

161
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,100
YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?

162
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,900
ASK MY SISTER.

163
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,000
Can you see us?

GHOST WHISPERER

167
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,500
SO, I'M GUESSING SINCE SHE WAS
IN FRONT OF SIGMA THETA CHI,

168
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,000
"ASK MY SISTER"
MEANT SORORITY SISTER.

169
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,000
YEAH. BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE BAG OVER HER HEAD?

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
DO YOU THINK SHE WAS KIDNAPPED,
TORTURED, WHAT?

171
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,600
PROBABLY BOTH.
IT'S CALLED HAZING.

172
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,600
OH, YEAH. IT IS THAT
TIME OF YEAR ISN'T IT.

173
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,600
YEP. PLEDGE WEEK.

174
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,300
MORE APTLY TITLED,
LORD OF THE FLIESSEASON--

175
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,300
WHEN SWEET-SEEMING CO-EDS
LIKE THESE

176
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,400
TORTURE, ABUSE, AND MOLD THE
MIND OF EAGER YOUNG FRESHMEN.

177
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,100
WAIT. YOU WEREN'T--

178
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,500
IN A SORITY? NO.
ALL RIGHT, I WAS WAY TOO SHY.

179
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,100
BUT I THOUGHT THAT COLLEGES
BANNED HAZING.

180
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,700
TECHNICALLY THEY DID.

181
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,100
BUT MY BUDDY IS
THE FACULTY GREEK ADVISOR.

182
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,500
AND HE SAYS
IT STILL GOES ON.

183
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,100
MUCH MORE ON THE HUSH-HUSH SINCE THE
TRUSTEES ARE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR IT.

184
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,400
SO, YOU THINK SHE WAS
BEING HAZED WHEN SHE DIED?

185
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,600
WELL, THE BAG-OVER-HEAD
TELLS ME YES.

186
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,100
BUT IF A STUDENT RECENTLY
DIED OR EVEN WENT MISSING,

187
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,800
EVERYBODY WOULD BE
TALKING ABOUT IT.

188
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,400
UNLESS IT WAS REALLY RECENT
AND SHE JUST DIED.

189
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
AND THE HOUSE DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT YET.

190
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,900
WELL, THE GHOST SURE SEEMED PRETTY SURE
THAT THE SORITY SISTER KNEW ABOUT IT.

191
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,600
AND SHE DID KEEP LOOKING
AT THAT ONE GIRL.

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,200
I COULD GO FIND THAT ONE GIRL.

193
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,600
SEE IF SHE'S IN THAT SORORITY.

194
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,800
WHAT?

195
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,100
NOTHING. NOTHING.

196
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,200
I'VE JUST NEVER QUITE SEEN YOU
SO EAGER TO GO FOLLOW THE LEAD.

197
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,200
OH, COME ON.
DON'T EVEN GO THERE.

198
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,000
OK. I'M A FACULTY MEMBER.

199
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,400
TECHNICALLY. LEGALLY, I CAN'T
EVEN THINK THOSE THOUGHTS.

200
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,600
HALF-NAKED CO-EDS
IN JEOPARDY THOUGHTS?

201
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,300
ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
LEAVE ME ALONE.

202
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,000
FINE, I'M GONNA GO MEET UP
WITH SAM.

203
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,000
AND YOU'RE GONNA
FOLLOW THE GIRL...

204
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,300
- I'M ALL OVER THAT BLONDE.
- RIGHT.

205
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,700
METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING.

206
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,000
- UH-HUH.
- OK.

207
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,300
I'M MORTIFIED.
I USED TO INTO THAT KINDA THING?

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,700
YEAH...IT WAS INTERESTING.

209
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,100
YEAH. IF BY INTERESTING, YOU MEAN
COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS, THEN SURE.

210
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,300
COME ON. YOU DON'T FIND A
LIME JELL-O TOWER WORK OF ART?

211
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,200
MAYBE AT A VEGAS BUFFET.

212
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,600
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MUCH
I WANT TO KISS YOU RIGHT NOW.

213
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,400
DO I HAVE TO IMAGINE?

214
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,400
NO. BUT YOU KNOW...

215
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,600
DON'T MOVE.

216
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,600
LATELY I'VE BEEN REALLY
INTO MOMENTS, YOU KNOW?

217
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,800
NOT LETTING THEM GO BY.

218
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,200
I MEAN, AFTER LOSING
MY WHOLE LIFE.

219
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,300
IS THAT CRAZY?

220
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,600
NOT AT ALL.

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'M ALMOST DONE.

222
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,600
TAKE YOUR TIME.

223
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,800
HI! EXCUSE ME.
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

224
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,600
YOU'RE MAKENNA, RIGHT?

225
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,100
YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT OF SIGMA
THETA CHI, RIGHT?

226
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,600
I'M ELI JAMES. I'M A PROFESSOR
IN THE PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT HERE.

227
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,800
CAN I HELP YOU?

228
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,100
THE THING IS, I GOT A TEXT

229
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,300
FROM ONE OF GIRLS THAT I TREAT.

230
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
AND I THINK SHE'S PLEDGING
YOUR SORITY,

231
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,100
AND MAY BE IN TROUBLE.

232
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,300
WAS IT FROM COURTNEY?

233
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,400
I CAN'T SAY.

234
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,000
DOCTOR/PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY.

235
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,300
BUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH COURTNEY?

236
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,500
I DON'T KNOW.

237
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,800
I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM ONE OF THE SISTERS.

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
OUR PLEDGES WERE OUT
IN THE WOODS LAST NIGHT,

239
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,700
COURTNEY HASN'T COME BACK.

240
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,900
HOW LONG'S SHE BEEN GONE?

241
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,300
EVERYONE SPILT UP
AROUND 2:00 THIS MORNING.

242
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,600
SHE SHOULD'VE BEEN BACK
5 HOURS AGO.

243
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,300
THAT'S A LONG TIME TO BE
OUT IN THE COLD.

244
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,800
I KNOW, AND IT DROPPED
BELOW FREEZING.

245
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,500
WE DIDN'T MEAN
FOR ANYONE TO GET HURT.

246
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,700
DON'T LET ME HOLD YOU UP.

247
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,700
WE SHOULD GO FIND HER.

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,600
YEAH.

249
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'M SO SORRY, MOM.

250
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,400
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE LET HER
GO OUT THERE.

251
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,600
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

252
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,900
I HAVE TO GO.

253
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,900
DON'T WORRY. EVERYONE'S OUT
THERE LOOKING FOR HER.

254
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,900
I'LL CALL YOU
AS SOON AS I HEAR ANYTHING.

255
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,600

HEY, EM...I'M REALLY SORRY.

256
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,700
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

257
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,300
I GAVE COURTNEY HER DIRECTIONS,

258
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,100
BUT MAYBE THEY DIDN'T MAKE SENSE.

259
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,000
EMILY, I'M PROFESSOR JAMES.

260
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,500
I'M A THERAPIST
OVER AT ROCKLAND U.,

261
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,900
IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU NEED
TO TALK--

262
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,400
THANKS. REALLY,
I JUST NEED TO FIND MY SISTER.

263
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,400
THIS IS REALLY BAD. 

264
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,300
WE'VE NEVER
HAD A PLEDGE WHO DID NOT COME BACK.

265
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,900
WAIT. SO EMILY AND THE MISSING
GIRL ARE ACTUAL SISTERS?

266
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,500
EMILY'S A JUNIOR.
COURTNEY'S A FRESHMAN.

267
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,800
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW CRUEL THEY ARE.

268
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,600
COURTNEY? IS THAT YOU?

269
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,000
I WANT TO HELP. PLEASE.
FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR SISTER.

270
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,300
LET ME TELL HER
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

271
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,700
SHE ALREADY KNOWS.

272
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,500
SO, THE GHOST IS
EMILY'S REAL SISTER.

273
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,600
AND WE THINK THAT EMILY
KNOWS SHE'S DEAD?

274
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,800
EMILY WAS A WRECK.

275
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,600
IT COULD HAVE BEEN GUILT, 

276
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,800
BUT TO
ME SHE SEEMED GENUINELY WORRIED.

277
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,600
LIKE HOPING HER SISTER
WOULD BE OK.

278
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,300
YEAH. OR HOPING THAT SHE DIDN'T GET
CAUGHT FOR WHATEVER THEY DID TO HER.

279
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,900
I MEAN, CHOOSING HER "SISTERS"
OVER HER OWN BLOOD,

280
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,200
DOES ANYONE REALLY DO THAT?

281
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,400
SHE MAY NOT HAVE A CHOICE.

282
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,900
I MEAN, SOMETIMES THESE
SORORITIES CAN BE BRUTAL.

283
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,100
THEY CHOOSE SISTERHOOD OVER ALL.

284
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,100
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE IT'S A CULT.

285
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,800
WELL?

286
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,400
YOU'RE AWAY FROM HOME
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

287
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,900
THEY OFFER YOU PROTECTION,
FAMILY, COMFORT.

288
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,100
YOU HAVE TO DO THESE CRAZY RITUALS
AND SAY THESE WEIRD OATHS TO GET IN.

289
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,000
CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT.

290
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,700
OK. SO, IF IT'S A COVER-UP,
THEN THEY CAN CLOSE RANKS.

291
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,500
AND SOON.

292
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,400
WHICH MEANS I SHOULD TALK
TO THE PLEDGES ASAP.

293
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,100
SO, YOU'RE WITH
THE PSYCH DEPARTMENT.

294
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,900
THEY SENT YOU TO TALK
TO US ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

295
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,200
THAT'S PERFECT. BECAUSE WE
TOTALLY NEED OUR HEADS EXAMINED.

296
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,300
IT WAS A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE.

297
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,200
COURTNEY'S MISSING. ELISE TOOK
A FALL AND HAD TO GET STITCHES.

298
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,500
SO, WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?

299
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,000
LOOK, I KNOW YOU GUYS WERE
PLEDGING SIGMA THETA LAST NIGHT.

300
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,600
AND I KNOW YOU TOOK
AN OATH OF SILENCE.

301
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,400
LIKEWE'DBE PROTECTINGTHEM?

302
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,900
WE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO JOIN
THAT CRAZY PLACE.

303
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,300
COURTNEY TALKED US INTO IT.

304
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,200
SHE CAN TALK ANYONE
INTO ANYTHING.

305
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,500
EVEN WEARING A BURLAP
SACK OVER YOUR HEAD?

306
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,100
SOMEONE NARCED ABOUT THAT?

307
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,300
THOSE THINGS WERE NASTY.

308
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,200
IT'S SUPPOSED TO SYMBOLIZE
EQUALITY WITHIN THE SISTERHOOD.

309
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,300
WITH BAGS ON
WE ALL LOOK THE SAME.

310
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,900
WE'RE ALL EQUALLY HUMILIATED
IS WHAT SHE MEANS.

311
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,900
WEARING BLACK NIGHTIES
TO BED EVERY NIGHT.

312
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,600
KEEPING TENNIES BY OUR BED 

313
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,000
SO THAT WE'RE READY WHENEVER
THEY DECIDE TO COME FOR US.

314
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,500
IT'S ALL MEANT
TO KEEP YOU ON EDGE.

315
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,800
SO, WHAT HAPPENED
UP IN THE WOODS?

316
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,700
WELL, WE WERE ALL GIVEN A SPECIFIC
PART OF THE SORORITY CREST TO FIND.

317
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,500
THEY CALL IT A TOKEN.

318
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,100
THEY SAID IF WE DIDN'T FIND
OURS THERE'D BE CONSEQUENCES.

319
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,600
WE SPLIT UP TO SEARCH.

320
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,400
WE NEVER SAW
COURTNEY AFTER THAT.

321
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,200
DO YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED TO COURTNEY?

322
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,300
SHE SUFFERED
THE CONSEQUENCES.

323
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,900
HONESTLY, THEY NEVER SAID
WHAT OUR PUNISHMENT WOULD BE.

324
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,600
BUT THOSE GIRLS ARE SEVERE.

325
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,100
THIS IS LIKE LIFE AND DEATH
TO THEM.

326
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,700
IF COURTNEY COULDN'T
FIND HER TOKEN,

327
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,900
I COULD SEE THEM DOING SOMETHING
TO HURT HER, NOT ON PURPOSE--

328
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,100
BUT HER OWN SISTER
WAS UP THERE.

329
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,600
SO? SHE DIDN'T WANT COURTNEY
TO MAKE IT ANYWAYS.

330
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,300
REALLY?

331
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,900
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
EVERY SORORITY WANTED COURTNEY.

332
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,800
SHE WAS SMART, SWEET, POPULAR.

333
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,500
EMILY WAS...NOT.

334
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,800
SHE WAS TOTALLY HARSH
TO COURTNEY LAST NIGHT.

335
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,700
GRABBED HER BEFORE WE LEFT.

336
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,100
WE COULDN'T HEAR WHAT
THEY WERE SAYING, 

337
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,700
BUT IT LOOKED PRETTY INTENSE.

338
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,500
FIRST THING I THOUGHT WHEN
COURTNEY DIDN'T COME BACK

339
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,300
WAS THAT EMILY HAD SABOTAGED HER.

340
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,200
EITHER THAT
OR THE NOOSE GOT HER.

341
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,200
SHH.

342
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,900
COME ON. DON'T TELL ME YOU ACTUALLY
BOUGHT INTO THAT WHOLE STORY.

343
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,600
WHAT STORY?

344
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,600
IT'S NOTHING. JUST PART
OF THEIR PSYCH OUT ROUTINE.

345
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,800
IT'S ALL MADE UP.

346
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,900
BUT THE WEIRDNESS
BETWEEN EMILY AND COURTNEY...

347
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,900
THAT WAS REAL.

348
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
- LET ME GET THAT FOR YOU.
- THANK YOU. SORRY.

349
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,700
THANKS. HERE.

350
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,300
IT'S FREEZING IN HERE.

351
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,200
YEAH. I KNOW.

352
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,900
THE THERMOSTAT'S BEEN STUCK
AT 58 FOR 2 DAYS.

353
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,700
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

354
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,300
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST--

355
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,900
I FELT BAD ABOUT ASKING YOU
TO DO THINGS AROUND HERE,

356
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,800
YOU KNOW, SINCE WE'RE...

357
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,400
SINCE...WE'RE DATING.

358
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,000
WOW. IT'S WEIRD
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

359
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL.

360
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,600
WAS HIGH SCHOOL THIS AWKWARD?
'CAUSE I'M GLAD I DON'T REMEMBER.

361
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,500
NO KIDDING.

362
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,000
NICE.

363
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,700
LOOK. WAIT A MINUTE.

364
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,900
IF WE'RE DATING, SHOULDN'T I
HELP YOU WITH THINGS LIKE THIS?

365
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,400
I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT BOYFRIENDS DO.

366
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,700
YEAH. I GUESS SO.

367
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,100
I MEAN, IF YOUR THERMOSTAT'S BROKEN,
YOU KNOW. 

368
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,100
IF YOUR FIRE NEEDS FEEDING...

369
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
HEAT RELATED PROBLEMS...

370
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,800
I'M YOUR MAN...

371
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,100
YOU'RE A LITTLE WARM.

372
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,300
THAT'S ME.

373
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,300
THAT'S ME.

374
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,800
GONE.

375
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,500
I WAS-- I WAS WARM.

376
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
- YEAH?
- RIGHT.

377
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,100
YOU WERE...

378
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,100
HI. I DON'T KNOW
IF I HAVE THE RIGHT NUMBER,

379
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,600
BUT I'M LOOKING FOR SAM.

380
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,100
HE'S NOT ANSWERING HIS CELL.
UH, THIS IS ED, HIS SUPERVISOR.

381
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,300
LOOK. I GAVE OUT YOUR NUMBER
AS A REFERENCE FOR WORK.

382
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,000
NICE.

383
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,800
A ROCKLAND STUDENT'S GONE
MISSING UP AT RED MOUNTAIN.

384
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,100
IT'S SUPPOSED TO DROP
INTO THE 30s TONIGHT.

385
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,400
SO, WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER
A SEARCH PARTY 

386
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,300
AT THE FIREHOUSE IF YOU CAN MAKE IT.

387
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,100
WOW. THAT'S BAD.

388
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,800
YEAH.

389
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,700
TO BE ALONE IN THESE WOODS
ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS.

390
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,500
POOR THING.

391
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,700
UM, I HATE TO DO THIS,
BUT I SHOULD GO.

392
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,100
RIGHT. RIGHT.
I'LL MEET UP WITH YOU.

393
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,800
AND I'LL SEE IF CAN GET
DELIA AND ELI TO COME TOO.

394
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,800
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW LONG
SHE CAN LAST UP THERE.

395
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,800
NOT VERY LONG, I DON'T THINK.

396
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,700
I'LL CALL YOU.

397
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,500
HEY, EMILY. ELI JAMES.

398
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,800
RIGHT. I REMBER.
YOU HELPING WITH THE SEARCH?

399
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,300
YEAH. I WAS HOPING I COULD
TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

400
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
UH, YEAH. SURE.

401
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,500
HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT COURTNEY
PLEDGING YOUR SORORITY?

402
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,300
I WAS FINE WITH IT. WHY?

403
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,300
I SPOKE WITH A FEW PLEDGES
WHO SAID THEY SAW YOU

404
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,900
GETTING INTO A FIGHT WITH HER
IN THE WOODS.

405
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,300
IT WASN'T A FIGHT.

406
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,200
SHE'S LYING!

407
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,100
WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOU TWO?

408
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,500
WE JUST HAD A DISAGREEMENT.

409
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,700
HOW COULD SHE DO THIS?

410
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,600
SO, YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING?

411
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,700
MAYBE TRY TO GET HER
OFF TRACK SOMEHOW?

412
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,500
MY SISTER IS OUT THERE,
POSSIBLY FREEZING TO DEATH,

413
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,700
AND YOU'RE ACCUSING ME
OF TRYING TO SABOTAGE HER?!

414
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
I'M NOT SAYING YOU MEANT
FOR THINGS TO GO THIS FAR.

415
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,200
BUT THINGS MAY HAVE GOTTEN
OUT OF HAND.

416
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,900
YOU'RE WRONG.

417
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
I WAS DIRTY PLEDGING.

418
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,800
WHAT?

419
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,100
I WAS TRYING TO HELP
COURTNEY.

420
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,000
THAT'S WHY I PULLED
HER ASIDE IN THE WOODS.

421
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
NOT YOU, COURTNEY.

422
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,500
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DROP OUT
NOW AND SAVE US ALL THE TIME?

423
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,700
- COME OVER HERE.
- TIE YOUR SHOES. GATHER YOUR WITS...

424
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,900
GIVE ME YOUR DIRECTIONS.

425
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,500
NO, I NEED THEM
TO FIND MY TOKEN.

426
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU ATE?

427
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,700
I'M FINE.

428
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,700
I TOLD YOU TO STASH
A POWERBAR IN YOUR SNEAKERS.

429
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,300
YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

430
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,300
TAKE MY DIRECTIONS.

431
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,800
THEIR MAPS IS NO GOOD. YOU'LL BE
WALKING AROUND IN CIRCLES ALL NIGHT.

432
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,600
I DON'T NEED ANY SPECIAL HELP.
I CAN DO THIS ON MY OWN.

433
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,500
JUST TAKE MY MAP.

434
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,800
FINE.

435
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,700
COURTNEY HAS LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

436
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,100
IT'S USUALLY NOT A BIG DEAL

437
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,300
EXCEPT WHEN YOU'RE GRABBED
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

438
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,400
AND LEFT TO WANDER THE WOODS FOR
6 HOURS WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER.

439
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,900
IT'S ALL HER
FAULT. DON'T BELIEVE HER.

440
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,000
HAVE YOU TOLD ANYONE ELSE THIS?

441
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,000
I TOLD THE POLICE EVERYTHING.

442
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,600
THEY MADE ME RE-DRAW
THE MAP.

443
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,200
BUT THEY SAID SHE MUST'VE
WANDERED OFF COURSE.

444
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,100
THERE WAS NO SIGN
OF COURTNEY ANYWHERE.

445
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,400
WHAT IF SHE NEVER COMES BACK,
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF ME?

446
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,800
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD LEAVE
SOMEONE OUT HERE 

447
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,600
ALONE OUT HERE ALL NIGHT.

448
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,300
YEAH. WELL. THEY'VE BEEN DOING
SECRET HAZINGS FOR YEARS.

449
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,200
BUT HOPEFULLY AFTER ALL THIS,
NOT ANYMORE.

450
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,500
 HEY! WAIT UP!

451
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,300
YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T YOU
GO AHEAD, AND I'LL WAIT.

452
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,800
- OK. SURE?
- YEAH.

453
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,800
SO HOW SAD IS THIS?

454
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,900
EVERYONE'S ON A RESCUE MISSION
WHEN WE KNOW IT'S REALLY A RECOVERY.

455
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,800
YEAH. HOW'D IT GO
WITH COURTNEY'S SISTER?

456
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,400
EMILY? SHE'S REALLY WORRIED
AND UPSET.

457
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,700
SHE SAID SHE TRIED TO HELP OUT
COURTNEY 

458
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,800
BY GIVING HER A BETTER MAP.

459
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,000
YEAH? THEN WHY IS
COURTNEY BLAMING HER?

460
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,400
WHAT IS THAT?

461
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,500
IT'S A NOOSE.

462
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,500
IT'S OBVIOUS YOU DON'T HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES.

463
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,700
ALL YOUR FELLOW PLEDGES
FOUND ALL THEIR TOKENS

464
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,400
AND RETURNED
TO THEIR DESIGNATED SPOTS.

465
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,600
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

466
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,300
NO, PLEASE.
JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

467
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,100
YOU MUST ANSWER THE FOLLOWING
QUESTION CORRECTLY TO BE SPARED.

468
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,300
WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
STARS ON THE SIGMA THETA CHI CREST?

469
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,200
I DON'T-- I'M NOT SURE.
THEY NEVER TOLD US.

470
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,600
YOU WERE TOLD THE ANSWER
ON YOUR FIRST DAY AS A PLEDGE.

471
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,400
IT'S TIME TO PAY
THE CONSEQUENCES.

472
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU?

473
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,600
I WON'T LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN.

474
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,800
So they circle Courtney like
a bunch of wolves and then what?

475
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,700
Did your vision show you how she died?

476
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,800
No. Just that she was terrified.

477
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,200
Do you think she froze to death?

478
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,100
Maybe.

479
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,500
But you saw their faces?
The sorority sisters?

480
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,500
Oh,no. I saw the "sisters."

481
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,900
Not a group I want to be a part of.

482
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,300
More importantly,was Emily?

483
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,100
No,she wasn't there.

484
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,700
You know,what'd the ghost mean

485
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,400
when she said that "she already knows"?

486
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,800
So,what? Emily found out after the fact?

487
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,000
Don't know.
But someone from your vision might.

488
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,900
If we can I.D. them.

489
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,800
All right
meet me at the sorority house. Ok?

490
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,600
Where did I?

491
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,600
My keys.

492
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,400
Hey. Where you off to?
You left your keys in the door.

493
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,800
Gosh, that's not good.

494
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,300
You on your way out?

495
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,900
Yeah,I told Eli that I'd meet him at the house.

496
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,900
Fire house.

497
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,700
Wait. You're going to
volunteer there,too?

498
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,300
Yeah. Yeah. I just thought
I'd answer some phones.

499
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,000
Guess you don't have any time
for a little raisin bagel.

500
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,500

Toasted. Light cream cheese.

501
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,300
You're really good to me.

502
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,200
I just...I promised
that I'd be there,like,now.

503
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,300
That's sort of amazing.

504
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,100
I mean,you just spent
the entire night in the woods.

505
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,600
And now you're
going in for another shift.

506
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah. Well,you know.

507
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,300
Free time. And,uh...

508
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,200
So,I just thought
I'd help out some more.

509
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,800
Ok. Well, please take time to eat.

510
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,600
Yeah,I will.

511
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,200
Ok.

512
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,700
The girls that you
saw tormenting Courtney...

513
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,300
They didn't have
any bags over their heads

514
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
So that means they're
current members, not pledges. Here.

515
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Ok. So, Emily's class was 2010.

516
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,100
That's weird.

517
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,800
What?

518
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,400
Well,this is Emily and
the girls from her class.

519
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,900
But none of them were in my vision.

520
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,800
So,check the year
before and the year after.

521
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,000
Ok.

522
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,000
Nope.

523
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,900
Not in either. But look at that.

524
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,300
"we survived Rebecca's noose."

525
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,500
So,that's noose
the pledges were talking about.

526
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,800
Yeah. But who's Rebecca?

527
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,600
I don't know.
She seems to be all over this book.

528
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
Ok. But wait. Look at this.

529
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
"heed the warning of Rebecca's noose.

530
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,900
She preys on pledges to make them pay!"

531
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,800
So,I'm guessing
this Rebecca was sort of a legend.

532
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,600
Apparently.
And one that's been around a long time.

533
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,100
Here's another one.

534
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,300
"we survived hell week.

535
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Thank god we didn't get
86'd by Rebecca '68!"

536
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,200
'68. Ok. 

537
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,700
So she was the class of '68 then,right?

538
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,500
Uh...Here.

539
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,500
Yeah, look.

540
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,700
"In memorial of Rebecca kelly."

541
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,600
So,I'm guessing that '68
wasn't the year she graduated.

542
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,500
It was the year she died.

543
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,500
Look,it's her obituary from the paper.

544
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,100
"Rebecca kelly
a student at Rockland university,

545
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,900
"was found dead
on Monday of an apparent fall

546
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,500
While on a sigma theta chi
sorority nature walk."

547
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,300
Nature walk?

548
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,100
I'm guessing that's code for hazing.

549
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,700
So the noose,you think
they hung the pledge?

550
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,900
Could've been an accident,

551
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,700
or their tormenting drove her to it.

552
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,600
Yeah. But the ghost said

553
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,100
that she wouldn't let this happen again.

554
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,500
So,what if what happened...

555
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,200
Wasn't a few nights ago.

556
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,600
What if it was 40 years ago?

557
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,200
I know who you are.
Your name is not Courtney.

558
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,700
It's Rebecca kelly,
and you died in 1968.

559
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,700
You've been haunting
the girls here ever since.

560
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,800
Please,I want to help you.
Just tell me what happened.

561
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,600
It's all because of them.

562
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,700
Did your sorority do this to you?

563
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,600
It wasn't Courtney. Ok.

564
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,000
She's just a pledge, she's innocent.

565
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,900
They need to know what goes on.

566
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,400
The horrible things
they do to each other.

567
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
A girl is missing.

568
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,700
Did you lead her away?

569
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,200
Do you know where she is?

570
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,800
No one can get to her now.

571
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,800
She's finally safe from them.

572
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,700
What do you mean?

573
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,300
She's my sister now.

574
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,100
Thank you so much.

575
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,300
Ok. Hold on.

576
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,300
"she's my sister now."

577
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,900
Does that mean Courtney's dead?

578
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,300
Maybe.
Or maybe the ghost is just hiding her.

579
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,900
It sounded like she wanted to
hurt the sorority,not Courtney.

580
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,500
Well she could get her wish soon.

581
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,700
If Courtney dies pledging,

582
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,400
That's pretty much
the end of the sorority,right?

583
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,900
Well,maybe that's what she's going for.

584
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,500
Maybe she's sacrificing
Courtney to put an end to hazing.

585
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,400
That is some twisted logic.

586
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,500
I got nothing here.

587
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,900
Grandview's paper article
about Rebecca's death

588
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,300
just calls it accidental.

589
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,100
Same spin as the university's.

590
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,700
Well,someone from her pledge class

591
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,800
has to know what happened to her.

592
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,300
We'll have to get back in that sorority

593
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,800
and find that pledge book from '68.

594
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Or...

595
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,100
Or we could look at this.

596
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,000
What?!

597
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,000
I borrowed it.
Thought it might come in handy,

598
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,400
especially after
we found out that the

599
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Rebecca legend
wasn't a legend after all.

600
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,300
Nice. A little Winona Ryder action.

601
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,000
Strange. But there's no
Rebecca Kelly listed in '68.

602
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,100
Well,maybe that's because
she never finished pledging.

603
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,500
Right. 'cause she died.

604
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,100
Well, one of the
other pledges from that year

605
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,200
has to know what happened to her.

606
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,700
Let's see who stuck around
after graduation. All right.

607
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,300
Carolyn Bouker...Alaska.

608
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,800
Jennifer Myron...Nothing.

609
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,100
Lauren Stack...Ok. Here we go.

610
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,900
She's in Grandview.

611
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,800
Yeah. I heard about the missing girl.

612
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,100
It's...It's awful.

613
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,700
It really is...

614
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,700
And we know her disappearance
had something to do with hazing.

615
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,500
That's why we're reaching out
to former sigma theta sisters.

616
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,300
Well,I'm afraid I was never a member.

617
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,000
I pledged as a freshman, but I dropped out.

618
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,900
The whole thing was just horrible.

619
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,000
Apparently it hasn't changed.

620
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,400
So it was the same ritual back then?

621
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
The bag over the heads.
The search for the tokens.

622
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,500
The freezing woods half-naked.

623
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,800
Half the time in the rain.

624
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,000
The night I pledged
was the worst night of my life.

625
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,100
There was a girl
in your group... Rebecca Kelly.

626
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
Was she one of the ones
that they were especially hard on?

627
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,000
No. She wasn't a pledge at all.

628
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,700
She was a member. One of the leaders.

629
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,400
Rebecca? Are you sure?

630
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,000
Oh yeah. I'm quite sure.

631
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,000
She was one of my tormenters.

632
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,900
The meanest one  of them all.

633
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,400
Congratulations,pledges.

634
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
I see you've successfully
retrieved your tokens.

635
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,600
Please remove their hoods.

636
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,700
Your fellow pledge,Lauren,
not only failed her mission

637
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,400
But failed to learn what
each piece of the crest signifies.

638
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,300
Her fate rests in your hands now.

639
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Each of you have the
choice to volunteer your tokens

640
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,000
to save Lauren from elimination.

641
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
If you give up your token,

642
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,400
You'll be able to make up
for it in the next round.

643
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,200
But if none of you decide to help her,

644
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,700
Lauren will pay the price.

645
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,200
I'm sorry,Lauren. 

646
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
But none of your fellow
pledges believe you're worthy.

647
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,000
That means you'll
be left here all night

648
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,600
to think about what it
means to be a sigma theta sister.

649
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,600
You can't leave me here! It's freezing.

650
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,400
Stars.

651
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,000
If you move outside
of this circle before sunrise,

652
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,900
you're finished.

653
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Your life on campus
as you know it will be over.

654
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
We'll make sure of that.

655
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,300
But it's dark.
I'll never find my way out of here alone.

656
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,200
That's why you have to stay put.

657
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,800
And don't even try following us.

658
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,600
Remember, we're always watching.

659
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,300
This is insane.

660
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,600
Someone,any one of you.
Don't go along with this, please.

661
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,100
Don't leave me here. Please!

662
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,700
Wait, wait, you know this isn't right.

663
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,100
You were here once.
Don't you remember how this felt?

664
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,300
I'm begging you, please!

665
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,400
Come back!

666
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,000
I stayed there until
I couldn't take the cold anymore.

667
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,000
I managed to find my way back.

668
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,600
And never stepped foot
in that sorority again.

669
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,500
I'm so sorry that must have been awful.

670
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,700
The star markers that you mentioned.

671
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,000
Did they ever use
nooses in the rituals?

672
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,300
Not that I remember.

673
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,000
Well,then they must've started
using them  after Rebecca died.

674
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,600
So,maybe the nooses had something
to do with how she died.

675
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,900
If they're using now,

676
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,300
It has everything
to do with Rebecca's death.

677
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
They said she got lost on a nature walk.

678
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,000
But we all heard that they found her

679
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,200
hanging off a cliff
near the Yarra lookout.

680
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,400
But if she wasn't a pledge,

681
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,200
then why did she
have a bag over her head?

682
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,900
I doubt she did.
Only pledges wear those.

683
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,000
Look,Rebecca was cruel and heartless.

684
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,300
I really thought
I was going to die that night.

685
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,100
And believe me,I wasn't the first
pledge that she put through that.

686
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,500
I don't think you're the last one,either.

687
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
Who's there?

688
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,500
I just can't believe the pledge I saw

689
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,400
being tortured in my vision was Lauren.

690
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,300
Well if the potato sack bag head look 

691
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,900
was to make pledges anonymous,

692
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,700
It sure worked.

693
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,300
What I don't get is,
if Rebecca's a member,

694
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,900
Then why was she dressed as a pledge?

695
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,200
Probably another
twisted part of the prank.

696
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,600
And the way Lauren talked,

697
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,600
Miss sigma chai latt is out there
tormenting Courtney even more.

698
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,400
Yeah,well,maybe in life
she was into the sororities,

699
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,800
but now it seems like
she just wants to shut them down.

700
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,600
And that made sense
when we thought she was a victim,

701
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,300
But she wasn't.

702
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,600
No,she was the tormenter.
Lauren's tormenter.

703
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,100
Thanks.

704
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,900
So,what? Then in death
she becomes a reformer?

705
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,600
So what happened?

706
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,400
I don't know. Maybe that's
what the second vision was about.

707
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,600
Maybe the girl
I saw in the woods was Lauren.

708
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,200
Maybe that was the last thing
Rebecca saw before she died.

709
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,300
Yeah. And maybe whatever
she saw stuck with her

710
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,000
and changed her mind about everything.

711
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,400
I'll be right back.

712
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,900
Rebecca.

713
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,100
Rebecca.

714
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,400
I understand what happened that night.

715
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,000
What you did to Lauren.

716
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,700
It was a part of the ritual, wasn't it?

717
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,100
You were just trying to do your part, 

718
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,600
being a good sigma theta.

719
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,700
Weeding out the weak ones
building a stronger sisterhood.

720
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,800
That's what they said when I pledged.

721
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,800
What I told my pledges.

722
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,500
And I believed it.

723
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,600
But something changed your mind.

724
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,100
At first,all I could think
was how well it went.

725
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,500
Well,that is why you have to stay put.

726
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
There always had to be one
pledge who didn't make it in.

727
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,700
But it's dark.
I'll never find my way back alone.

728
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,300
A sacrificial lamb
to show how serious we were.

729
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,000
So why not Lauren?

730
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,000
She was timid and meek.

731
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,400
She was the easiest to get rid of.

732
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,300
Please stop! don't leave me here!

733
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,000
You can't leave me...

734
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,000
Yeah. But in the vision, she was alone.

735
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,400
Because when I got back to the cabin,

736
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,100
I realized that
I'd dropped my flashlight.

737
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,000
So I borrowed one of the pledge's
lights and went back.

738
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,500
I had seen lots of girls
crying during the ritual,

739
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,900
But this time Lauren got to me.

740
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,300
She was so scared. So desperate.

741
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,300
And we had done that to her.

742
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,400
I had done that to her.

743
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,700
I couldn't think of what to do.

744
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,900
But she was clearly asking for help.

745
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Help that she didn't think
she would get from any of us.

746
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,600
Lauren had to have
that dagger by sunrise.

747
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
And only another pledge
could give it to her. So...

748
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,600
I had to hurry or
the girls would come looking.

749
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,500
So,I took a shortcut.

750
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,600
I knew I wasn't supposed to be there.

751
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,700
It was a slide area.

752
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,400
But I had to find the token
and get back to Lauren quickly.

753
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,800
Then I heard the rumbling.

754
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,300
I knew what it meant,
but it was too late.

755
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,400
I let her down.

756
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,900
So,that's why you're out here?

757
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,600
Trying to make amends
for what you did to Lauren?

758
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You don't know what it's like.
They did it to me,too.

759
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,000
My supposed "sisters."

760
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,600
They humiliated and tormented me

761
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Until they finally broke my spirit.

762
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,900
If it was so awful, then why
did you do it to other girls?

763
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,600
Because once I was in,

764
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,900
I felt like
I was part of something special.

765
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,600
And in my mind,the hazing...

766
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,200
It was one of the
things that made it special.

767
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,900
That is how it works.
How it keeps working.

768
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,000
And it won't ever stop
until something terrible happens.

769
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,400
Like Courtney dying?

770
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,100
Yes. I've tried to stop them.

771
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,700
I've been trying for so long.

772
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,500
But nothing gets through to them.

773
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,400
Courtney's still alive isn't she?

774
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,700
It won't be long now.

775
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,900
You can't let that happen.

776
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,200
Look,what they did to you...
It was...Awful.

777
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,400
But hurting Courtney
is not gonna fix any of this.

778
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,400
Yes,it will.

779
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,100
It is the only thing that will.

780
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,100
They can't cover this up.

781
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,300
It's not about them.

782
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,200
It's about a pledge... Just like Lauren,

783
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,300
Who's young and scared and innocent.

784
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,200
You can save Courtney.

785
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,200
This is your chance to make it right.

786
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,800
Please,Rebecca. Show me the way.

787
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Wait I see something!

788
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,400
Hey,over here. We found her.

789
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,100
Courtney! Courtney!

790
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,400
Oh,my god. Thank god,you're alive.

791
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,300
You did it.

792
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,500
You saved her.

793
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,200
Hey,Sam,you hear? They found the girl.

794
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,900
Yeah. Yeah,I did hear that.
That's great news.

795
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,900
Look,can I ask you a favor.

796
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,200
I want to surprise a friend of mine.

797
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,000
I think she volunteers here.

798
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,400
Her name's Melinda Gordon.

799
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,000
I don't know her. 

800
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,800
But I can check the sign
in sheet if you want.

801
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:25,900
All right.

802
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,200
Melinda Gordon...

803
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,200
Hmm. She wasn't in this morning.

804
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,800
And...She wasn't here last night either.

805
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,000
Well,thanks. Thanks for checking.

806
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,800
Just in, we have cell phone footage
of the moment of the rescue.

807
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,400
This was sent to us from
one of the volunteers

808
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,100
In the first search group
to find Courtney Harris.

809
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,300
We can see several volunteers and

810
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,700
Rescuers looking on
as paramedics tend to Courtney.

811
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,400
Courtney was reunited
with her older sister Emily,

812
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,700
Also a student as Rockland university,
at the scene of the rescue.

813
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,100
Ok. That should do for now.

814
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,600
I'll be back with a stretcher.

815
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,400
Thank you.

816
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,200
Thank you.

817
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,000
Is it true what Emily just told me?

818
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,200
The legend of Rebecca's real,

819
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,700
And she was out there with me?

820
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,400
Yeah.

821
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,100
She led us to you.

822
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,000
I thought I felt something out there.

823
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,200
That was her.

824
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,800
And she's here with us right now.

825
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,500
I should've listened to you
and followed your map.

826
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,900
No. It's ok.

827
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,100
I should've known you'd
want to do this on your own.

828
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,100
Everyone in the sorority
kept telling me 

829
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,400
that you didn't want me there.

830
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,900
So,I just started to believe them.

831
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,800
No. It's not that
I didn't want you there.

832
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,600
I just didn't think that you
needed to join a sorority to make friends.

833
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,400
Why? Because everything
comes so easily to me?

834
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,900
Everyone always thinks that...

835
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,700
No, Courtney.

836
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,500
I just didn't want you to
go through what I had to go through.

837
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,000
You know that I only
wanted to join that stupid place

838
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,200
to be with you,right?

839
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,300
They have what I was always looking for.

840
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:19,700
I know.

841
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,300
What? What did she say?

842
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,500
She's happy. Seeing the 2 of you together.

843
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,800
You're true sisters.

844
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,900
Will you thank her for me?

845
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,100
I never would have been found without her.

846
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,100
You helped her find the light.

847
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:38,900
I think you're even.

848
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,100
Please tell Lauren that I'm sorry.

849
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,200
And that I tried to make it right.

850
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,800
I will... Will tell her everything.

851
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,700
I heard you come in.

852
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,000
You know they found that girl?

853
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,500
Yeah. It's great news.

854
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,400
I mean
I think the whole town is relieved.

855
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,500
Yeah. You're not kidding me.

856
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,200
I was with a bunch of guys.
We were about to go back up that hill.

857
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,900
They made the announcement,
everybody started cheering.

858
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,100
Yeah. It was amazing.

859
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,200
I mean there were
definitely lots of hugs

860
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,700
Yeah. Yeah.

861
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,900
Where were you?

862
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,900
The...The firehouse.

863
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,600
Right. Yeah,you told me that. I forgot.

864
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,100
Well,since there's happy news.

865
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,900
How about breakfast?

866
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,700
You know,
I'm so far behind on the job site

867
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,100
because of all this rescue stuff

868
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,700
I should just get myself
together and get back on that.

869
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,000
Of course,sure.

870
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,200
But thanks.

871
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,400
So,I'll see you later then?

872
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,500
Yeah. Of course.

873
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,500
Later.

874
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
