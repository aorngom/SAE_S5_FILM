00:00:00,168 --> 00:00:02,835
Previously on Ghost Whisperer...

2
00:00:04,802 --> 00:00:07,857
No! Please! Not you.

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,408
I'm so empty without you.

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:10,476
And I'm not going anywhere.

5
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:11,477
You have to cross over.

6
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,545
I don't want to.

7
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,421
Jim, no.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,058
- You're back. - Do I know you?

9
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,461
Look, I see the same guy that you see,

10
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,796
different hair, nose, eyes.It's not Jim.

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,516
I just know what I see when I look in those eyes.

12
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:36,168
And Jim, he's in there somewhere.He just has to be.

13
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,671
It's not much, but maybe you could help me finish my garage.

14
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,106
And you could live there while you do the work.

15
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,174
Just until you figure out your next move.

16
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:45,130
Will you tell me what's going on between us.

17
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:46,756
Do you know how lucky you are?

18
00:00:46,774 --> 00:00:49,582
You're going to get a second shot at your one true love.

19
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,236
I bought that less than a month ago.

20
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:55,688
Question is who did I buy it for?


22
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:23,810
Phones are finally turned on.

23
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,527
And I checked the faucets,and the water's running.

24
00:01:25,562 --> 00:01:28,345
Almost got lost on my back way here, this place is huge.

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,334
So is the commission if I land a sale.

26
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,920
These people must be loaded,

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,661
I can't believe they just left all this.

28
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,692
I know it happened sometimes.

29
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,452
So what if the new owners don't like their stuff?

30
00:01:40,487 --> 00:01:43,118
I guess we auction it off for charity.

31
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:45,612
Can I bit a dollar on the Xbox in the den?

32
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:49,441
No.But you can help me take all the pictures off the wall.

33
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:55,651
- Is this them? The Bancrofts.  - Yeah.

34
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:57,258
They left their pictures, too?

35
00:01:57,293 --> 00:01:59,000
That's why we're packing all these up.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,608
Because I'm sure they're gonna want some of these.

37
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:02,877
The walls are going to look pretty blank.

38
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:04,535
Well, you know, buyers like

39
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:06,158
to picture themselves in a house.

40
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,377
That's why Melinda is going to get

41
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,529
some prints to fill everything up.

42
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:15,747
That reminds me.I have got to go.Pick her up.

43
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:18,037
I need you to do me a favor.

44
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,072
Cut the grass.

45
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,380
The lawn-mower is outside back in the shed, ok?

46
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:25,103
People normally charge for that, you know?

47
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:28,964
Well...how does free room and board sound?

48
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,391
Fine.

49
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:32,080
I'm gonna take off for now.

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,770
But I'm just gonna be gone for about an hour.

51
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,688
Come on, come on, Come on, hurry.

52
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,079
911, what is your emergency?

53
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,430
Can you verify the location for me?

54
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:52,665
Sir, I need you to apply pressure to the wound.

55
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,799
Everything will be ok. Help is on the way.

56
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,935
911, what is your emergency?

57
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,649
We need help! Please send an ambulance.

58
00:03:58,684 --> 00:04:02,822
I've got your location, sir. 4225 Avalon Circle, is that correct?

59
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:05,068
He's bleeding, it's really bad... God!

60
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,279
Ok, I'm dispatching an ambulance right now.

61
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,215
Can you tell me, is the victim conscious?

62
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,550
Yes, It rolled over him, the lawn mower, he's...

63
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,819
Sir, can you tell me if he is breathing?

64
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:19,825
He's all cut up! 4225 Avalon Circle ... Please!

65
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,996
You'll see the staging is basically done for us.

66
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,399
None of the things seems the least big strange to you?

67
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,502
They left all their family photos behind. I mean, who does that?

68
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,805
As long as the commission check clears, I don't really care.

69
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:42,778
Is this the house you're selling?

70
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:45,784
Where is Ned?

71
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:49,185
What happened?

72
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,923
We got a call about an accident-kid hurt by a lawn- mower.

73
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,758
My God!

74
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,197
Ned! Ned, Ned!

75
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,615
And you do not have the keys to the house?

76
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:00,966
No, just the shed.

77
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:01,300
No, just the shed.

78
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,900
I swear I didn't make that call.

79
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,000
Ned! Are you ok?!

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,700
I'm fine. I don't know what they're talking about.

81
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,700
Hey, Bobby, What's going on?

82
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,100
- Melinda, How are you?  - I'm ok.

83
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
We got a 9-1-1 call from this address.

84
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,800
It wasn't me.

85
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,100
Could anyone else have used the phone?

86
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,400
This is my listing, nobody else has the key.

87
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,300
What about the sellers?

88
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,800
No, We changed the lock.

89
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,600
Your son said he didn't see anyone go in.

90
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,700
I was out here mowing the lawn,

91
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,200
So maybe I just didn't notice.

92
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,300
What was the emergency?

93
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,300
Caller said someone got badly cut

94
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,000
by the blades of a lawnmower.

95
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,200
I looked around.

96
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,600
There's no one else in there.

97
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,300
Must have been a prank.

98
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,400
Yeah, it wasn't a prank.

99
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,000
Somebody did need help,

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
They just didn't get to him in time.

101
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,700
That's him.

102
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,600
That's the boy that I saw in the yard.

103
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,500
That's the Bancroft's youngest son Josh.

104
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Well, It's a good bet he died at the house, then.

105
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,700
No, I just went over all the sales paperwork,

106
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,200
and the Bancrofts never disclosed a death on their property.

107
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,100
Well, It's not exactly a well-kept secret.

108
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,200
Listen to this article from 2 years ago-

109
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,700
"14 year old Josh Bancroft

110
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,400
"died in an accident at his family's home

111
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
"riding a lawnmower. Severe lacerations,

112
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,300
Paramedics were unable to revive him."

113
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,800
That is horrible. I can't even imagine it.

114
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,900
But why would the boy still be there?

115
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,600
Well, Bobby was sure that the call

116
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,100
was made from the house phone,

117
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,000
And the kid seemed fixated on the paramedics.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I think the ghost called 9-1-1.

119
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
A ghost that uses the telephone?

120
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,000
Those calls are recorded in some sort of databank,

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,100
and ghosts manipulate electronics all the time.

122
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,200
I just had that line turned on yesterday.

123
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,000
So maybe when Ned fired up that mower,

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,300
It provoked the ghost.

125
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,700
And what, he's calling for help?

126
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,300
well, he might not realize it's too late.

127
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,100
Someone needs to tell him that he's dead and it's time to move on.

128
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,800
Well, Could you?

129
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,400
I have an open house in just a few days,

130
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,500
and the market is tough enough as it is.

131
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,900
Yes, I'll get right on it, just as soon-

132
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,700
Who's he talking to?

133
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,000
This is going to drive me nuts.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,400
What?

135
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
He's trying to figure out

136
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,900
Who he bought that engagement ring for.

137
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,000
I mean,He could be talking to her right now!

138
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,400
Who,  he fiancee?

139
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,400
She is not his fiancee until he puts a ring on her finger.

140
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,300
It's ok, honey, Just breathe.

141
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,100
I know that he just wants to find her

142
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,500
and tell her that he didn't fall off the face of the earth.

143
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,800
That's right. There's really nothing to worry about.

144
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,500
He's just trying to make peace with his past.

145
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,400
Yeah, but his past isn't Sam's.

146
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,300
He's Jim. I'm his past.

147
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,100
Bye, Delia.

148
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,800
I know. It's been too long.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,700
Yeah, me, too.

150
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,700
I promise you're going to hear

151
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,300
a lot more from me from now on.

152
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,600
and Jordan, you know, please tell mom and dad I said bye, ok?

153
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,100
Thanks. hi.

154
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,100
Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear.

155
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,800
How's your sister?

156
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,400
Jordan's great, you know?

157
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,900
Things between her and my parents are really good now.

158
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,600
Great. So did she ever get you any answers?

159
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,000
You know, about the ring?

160
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Are you still trying to figure out who you bought it for?

161
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,100
no.

162
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,400
Jordan put a lot of things together for me.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,400
Well, Great. So...

164
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,100
Can I ask you a question?

165
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,300
When you met your husband Jim,

166
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,900
Did you know right away?

167
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,000
I mean, Could you tell he was the one?

168
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,900
Yes.

169
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,700
Jordan says it wasn't like that at all with me and Nicole.

170
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,200
- She's my   - Girlfriend.

171
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,600
Right. She said it was 8 years of on again, off again,

172
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
on again until I finally got the ultimatum,

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,300
Let's get married or get out of here.

174
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,700
So by the looks of my new zip code,

175
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,200
I chose door number 2.

176
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,900
But even though you moved here, you bought a ring.

177
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,900
Yeah, Which I then stowed in a safety deposit box.

178
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,000
So... It looks like I flaked on her again.

179
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,700
Yeah, or maybe, maybe-

180
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,900
Maybe you just hadn't decided yet.

181
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,000
Too many maybes, huh?

182
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,600
See you later.

183
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,300
Hey, Can you hand me the runner for the centerpiece?

184
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,100
So you haven't met the family yet?

185
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,200
No, just their lawyers, who threatened to fire me

186
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,500
When I asked why their son's death

187
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,800
wasn't on the disclosure form.

188
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,700
Well, I'm sure they'd rather get sued

189
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,000
then have someone ask them about it.

190
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,700
But you know, even the best lawyers

191
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,500
can't stop neighborhood gossip.

192
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,900
Is he here?

193
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,800
No.

194
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,200
No, Speak freely.

195
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,200
Ok. Well, Another realtor in my office

196
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,100
Said that she heard that Mr. Bancroft

197
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,200
was driving the mower when his son died.

198
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,700
No wonder they left everything.

199
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah, everything but their memories.

200
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,500
You know, It's just so sad.

201
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,000
The whole family falls apart, the parents get a divorce,

202
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,300
and then their son moves hundreds

203
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,400
of miles away to go to Strathmore university.

204
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,000
Do you hear that?

205
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,100
What?

206
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,100
We had a good idea it was a prank

207
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,000
When we got the same call from the same house.

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,300
Well, Do you know who placed the call?

209
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,700
Was it a woman or a man?

210
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,300
Dispatch said it was an adult male.

211
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,800
What's weird is, his side of the call was exactly the same.

212
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,000
No matter what he was asked, he used the same words

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,800
as the call yesterday, verbatim.

214
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,000
What the hell is going on here?

215
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,900
I - I don't know.

216
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,200
I put a call into the phone company,

217
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,100
and I'm hoping they might have some answers.

218
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,300
We can send more patrol over to help you watch the house.

219
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
- Whatever you can do to help. - Ok.

220
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,500
Josh, I'm sorry.

221
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,200
It's-It's too late.

222
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,400
They can't save you, you're already dead.

223
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
Why are you here?

224
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
To help you,

225
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,300
Cause I know that you're confused.

226
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,900
You're the one who's confused.

227
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,700
Josh... Your family moved on.

228
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,800
You should, too.

229
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,200
No. That's wrong.

230
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,600
They're running away, but they can't escape.

231
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,600
They're running away, but they can't escape...

232
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,000
What does that mean?

233
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,600
I don't know, I think maybe he wants them to come home?

234
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,500
I mean, they split up after he died,

235
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,200
So maybe he thinks showing his presence in that way

236
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,600
will get them back together again.

237
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,400
Yeah, but that's a tall order.

238
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,900
The lawyer says he can't even get the parents

239
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,400
in the same room together.

240
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,300
And what about those phone calls, anyway?

241
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,000
Bobby said that it was a man.

242
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,100
I think he's resending his original 9-1-1 calls from the accident,

243
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,600
And the caller, it had to have been his father.

244
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,400
Can you imagine the guilt?

245
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,800
- So what happens now? - I don't know.

246
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,000
But I won't know what we're up against

247
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,700
until I get to know the family better.

248
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,800
Hi, Mrs. Bancroft,

249
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
I have a delivery for you.

250
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,300
Well, please, come on in.

251
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,200
Thank you.

252
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,100
My name is Melinda Gordon. I'm friends with Delia,

253
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,600
who's selling your grandview house,

254
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
And I've been helping her stage it.

255
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,200
Anyway, when I saw this, um,

256
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,200
I thought that you would want it.

257
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,000
Thank you for coming all the way out here,

258
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,100
But, uh, no, I don't, actually...

259
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,200
want this.

260
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,700
Would you tell your friend

261
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,100
that I don't want anything

262
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,300
from that house?

263
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,600
Ok, Well, I'm sorry for the confusion.

264
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,100
I guess your style here is different.

265
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,500
It's lovely.

266
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,400
Thank you.

267
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,800
I just needed a change.

268
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,900
A fresh start.

269
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,400
I've been feeling the same way recently.

270
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,300
I just lost my husband, so...

271
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,300
Oh, I'm sorry.

272
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,500
So am I. About your son.

273
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,800
How did you get through it?

274
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,700
I just... knew he'd be with me.

275
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Wherever I went.

276
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,700
And...

277
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,500
He is.

278
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,900
What about you?

279
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,600
Do you feel like...

280
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,100
Here that your son is with you?

281
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,400
Well, he's in my heart always.

282
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,600
But I didn't move

283
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,700
to escape the memory of my son.

284
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,000
My older son, he's in college,

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,600
And my husband and I are...

286
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
divorced, and...

287
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,900
I did try not to blame him.

288
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,200
But I just, I couldn't help it.

289
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,300
Do you know we had the same argument

290
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,300
about parenting for 20 years?

291
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,600
Doug thought that I was too strict,

292
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,200
and I thought that he was too lenient,

293
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,300
And...

294
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,100
And I was gone for an hour.

295
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
For one hour.

296
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,100
Well, you can't blame yourself.

297
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
Oh, I don't. I blame Doug.

298
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,500
He is the reason that my son is dead.

299
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,800
I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee. See ya.

300
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,400
Ok, I'll see you later.

301
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,872
- Hi, Sam.  - Ned, how is it going?

302
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:05,940
Good, just here to do some statistics homework.

303
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:08,176
- You?   - Statistics? Brutal.

304
00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:12,747
Wait a minute. Can you help me?

305
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:17,318
I'm trying to get into my E-mail but I forgot my password

306
00:15:17,386 --> 00:15:19,153
When I guess when I forgot everything else in my life.

307
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,111
What have you tried?

308
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:25,059
My birthday, my Alma Mater, my family dog's name,

309
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:26,995
Every scrap of information anyone's ever given me.

310
00:15:27,062 --> 00:15:29,297
You might have allowed your browser to save your passwords,

311
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:31,266
Especially if you are working behind a firewall.

312
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,067
That sounds dangerous.

313
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:36,805
All right.Here is your password file.

314
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:38,673
Let's just hope it's not encrypted.

315
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:46,381
- You are in luck.  - No kidding.

316
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:48,783
- Thanks Ned. - FYI ...

317
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:52,620
- Your password is "password".  - Yeah.

318
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:57,091
Work, more work. Spam, a lot spam.

319
00:15:58,328 --> 00:16:01,906
And apparently I am really bad at fantasy football.

320
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:04,508
- Looking for something specific?  - I do not know.

321
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:09,037
I guess I'm looking for somebody to tell me what I was looking for.

322
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,774
Hey, black coffee, please.

323
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:16,477
Maybe I could tell me what I was looking for.

324
00:16:16,545 --> 00:16:19,279
Yeah, that's great, thank you.

325
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:24,819
"Nicole, I know you're mad, but this time is different "

326
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:27,822
"I bought the ring, I am ready"

327
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,242
"I love you, Sam."

328
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:37,466
- Who is Nicole72?  - I do not remember.

329
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,802
But it looks like that it was ready to marry her.

330
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:43,517
If the ghost wants his family to be together again,

331
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:45,197
It's getting be waiting a long time.

332
00:16:45,242 --> 00:16:47,958
- Yep, but it was an accident.  - Not in her mind.

333
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,134
I mean, She blames the father completely.

334
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:53,681
It was like the last in a series of very irresponsible moves.

335
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:58,086
Maybe just a inch that way.

336
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:02,791
You know, well, if Josh felt the same way,

337
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:06,227
Maybe that's what he meant when he said they were running away.

338
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:10,031
Maybe he thinks his father's running away is from his guilt.

339
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,343
Yes, or maybe not.

340
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,736
He came.

341
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:23,612
I guess I did not realize that we'd left so much behind.

342
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:25,880
Melinda has been helping me style the house.

343
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:28,077
She spoke with your wife to see

344
00:17:28,077 --> 00:17:30,272
if she wanted to keep any of the collectables.

345
00:17:30,307 --> 00:17:35,124
- Is there anything you'd like to keep?  - You saw Elena ...

346
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:36,891
How is she?

347
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:40,361
She seemed eager to sell the house.

348
00:17:41,324 --> 00:17:43,098
Well, I'm gonna be sorry to see it go.

349
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:49,004
Even with everything that happened, we were a family.

350
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:52,039
We were happy here.

351
00:17:54,543 --> 00:17:56,211
I'm so sorry.

352
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,681
I know that you lost your son here.

353
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:06,360
I still feel him aound me.

354
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:11,245
- Is that crazy?  - No.

355
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:19,934
If you could ... talk to him.

356
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:24,944
What would you say?

357
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,412
Do you have any idea how he died?

358
00:18:31,147 --> 00:18:34,183
There was so much blood ...

359
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:39,654
You just can't believe that there's that much blood inside anyone.

360
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:48,462
Josh had watched me teach Devin to drive.

361
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:52,867
Like any kid brother,he was jealous as hell.

362
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:56,838
Come on Dad, I wanna try it.

363
00:18:56,906 --> 00:18:58,206
I figured what would it hurt him

364
00:18:58,206 --> 00:18:59,507
to give him a chance to steer.

365
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:01,745
So I let him sit with me.

366
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,446
I thought it was safe. It was a bad call.

367
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:08,783
We lost control.

368
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,286
Josh! Josh!

369
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:12,754
And I lost Josh.

370
00:19:12,822 --> 00:19:16,758
Josh! Josh! God!

371
00:19:16,826 --> 00:19:19,461
God!

372
00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:23,664
My boy, my boy, my boy!

373
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:30,005
I would give anything to take him back, anything.

374
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:32,206
Liar.

375
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:36,244
Excuse me.

376
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:38,480
Hello?

377
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:39,631
911, what is your emergency?

378
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:40,715
We need help!

379
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:43,350
Please send an ambulance!

380
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:49,582
We need help! Please!

381
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:51,158
What's going on?

382
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:53,728
We need help! Please!

383
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,234
It is the same 911 call.

384
00:19:56,402 --> 00:20:00,303
Why is this happening?  Why won't it stop?

385
00:20:01,571 --> 00:20:03,705
Please stop this.

386
00:20:03,773 --> 00:20:05,773
In Avalon Circle, please!

387
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:14,149
These phone calls you've received them before, since when?

388
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,886
For a couple of days, Why won't they stop?

389
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:21,123
You are hurting him ... Why are you doing this?

390
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,058
He knows why.

391
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:26,728
Wait a minute, who were you talking to? What's going on here?

392
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:34,869
This has gonna stop.

393
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:45,376
- Hello?  - Hey, Bobby, It's Melinda.

394
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,249
Listen, are you on your way to the Bancroft's house?

395
00:20:47,316 --> 00:20:48,884
- Yeah, I am.  - Yeah, I know it.

396
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:50,615
I just want to tell you it's a false alarm.

397
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,500
Thanks for the head's up,

398
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,021
But we're headed in that direction,anyway.

399
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:54,289
One of the neighbors went out to get her mail

400
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:55,490
comes back in with palpitations.

401
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:57,559
- Why? What happened?  - You're at the house, right?

402
00:20:57,627 --> 00:21:00,495
- Yeah.  - 4227 Avalon Circle?

403
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:02,630
Take a look at the lawn.

404
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:12,746
Help me

405
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:22,317
- Help me.  - Yes, help me.

406
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,953
As if the 911 calls weren't enough.

407
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,789
He seared his plea into the neighbor's lawn.

408
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:30,025
No, I understood that part, I mean help me,it's my only tie.

409
00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:34,464
Sorry.

410
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:36,465
Well, it's interesting to see that the ghosts

411
00:21:36,466 --> 00:21:38,100
is branching out in the new media.

412
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:40,169
Yeah, but why?

413
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:42,171
I mean is he worried that this phone call is going unheard?

414
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:44,574
They sure got his father's attention.

415
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,108
Has the ghost tried to call anyone else?

416
00:21:46,176 --> 00:21:48,844
Mr. Bancroft said he has not heard from his son on the subject.

417
00:21:48,912 --> 00:21:51,547
- How about the mum?  - I do not think so.

418
00:21:51,615 --> 00:21:53,166
I gave her plenty of chances to talk about£¬

419
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,717
Bumps in the night,she didn't take the bait.

420
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:57,319
So it seems like the ghost has a beef with the old man.

421
00:21:57,387 --> 00:21:58,487
But why?

422
00:21:58,555 --> 00:22:01,991
I mean to make Mr. Bancroft feel...

423
00:22:02,058 --> 00:22:04,994
even more guilty for causing his death?

424
00:22:05,061 --> 00:22:06,645
I mean, the guy is so guilt-ridden already,

425
00:22:06,645 --> 00:22:08,230
What's the point?

426
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:10,221
"Help me"

427
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:14,020
Blot, don't rub.

428
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,239
No, this time makes me mulling the concept.

429
00:22:17,307 --> 00:22:19,008
Maybe it is not about blame,

430
00:22:19,008 --> 00:22:20,709
Maybe the ghost is asking for something.

431
00:22:20,777 --> 00:22:22,962
And we're just not getting it?

432
00:22:22,962 --> 00:22:25,147
I mean, he does keep sending the phone call,

433
00:22:25,215 --> 00:22:27,504
Maybe there's something we're not hearing.

434
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:30,764
You were right, calls we've been getting was a recording

435
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:32,377
of an original call back in 2006.

436
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:33,989
I got this copy from a buddy at dispatch.

437
00:22:34,357 --> 00:22:37,400
- How did you know about the accident?  - I know the family.

438
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:39,045
It's a shame.

439
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:40,596
Do you have any idea where these calls are coming from?

440
00:22:40,664 --> 00:22:42,398
- No.  - Do you?

441
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:44,600
I'm just trying to help the family.

442
00:22:50,806 --> 00:22:52,475
911, what is your emergency?

443
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:54,176
We need help! Send an ambulance!

444
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:55,911
Can you can tell me what happened, sir?

445
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:59,115
Yeah, It's rolled over him, the lawn mower. He's all cut off.

446
00:22:59,182 --> 00:23:02,135
Can you verify the location for me?

447
00:23:02,135 --> 00:23:05,088
Yes, 4225 Avalon Circle. Please!

448
00:23:05,956 --> 00:23:07,223
The ambulance is on its way.

449
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,540
I need you to check that the victim is breathing. Can you do that?

450
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:13,963
I don't know! He's bleeding! It's really bad! God!

451
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,298
Please! Could you please hurry up?

452
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,000
Well hang on .The other one's cued up as well.

453
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,403
The other one?

454
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,089
Came in a couple of minutes before this one,

455
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:23,709
From a different number.

456
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:27,576
- 911, what is your emergency?  - No, no, no, no!

457
00:23:29,797 --> 00:23:31,920
Was that Josh's father again?

458
00:23:31,955 --> 00:23:33,100
It is not uncommon for people

459
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,084
to reach for a backup during an emergency.

460
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:36,768
So then why did he hang up?

461
00:23:36,803 --> 00:23:41,251
Lost reception, had to help his son, I do not know.

462
00:23:42,092 --> 00:23:43,856
Can I keep that?

463
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:48,597
If it gives you any leads on who's been sending them, let me know.

464
00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:50,298
Thank you.

465
00:23:51,334 --> 00:23:53,018
I hate to bring this up,

466
00:23:53,018 --> 00:23:54,703
But I have a buyer who wants to come to see the house,

467
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:57,723
So I was just wondering what the next move was

468
00:23:57,723 --> 00:24:00,676
with the occupant.

469
00:24:02,356 --> 00:24:06,749
- I really don't have one.  - Really?

470
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:10,712
Delia, you're at the house right now,aren't you?

471
00:24:10,747 --> 00:24:12,234
Fine, OK.I'll meet you there.

472
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:13,722
No, no, no, I'm fine.

473
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,448
I just forgot some papers here.

474
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:18,816
Besides, you're the one who always say that

475
00:24:18,816 --> 00:24:21,149
ghosts can't really hurt people.

476
00:24:21,184 --> 00:24:23,733
- Right?  - Right.

477
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:27,970
Do they break windows?

478
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,072
I'm already looking for my car keys.

479
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,752
No, no, no, I'll just have Sam come and fix it.

480
00:24:32,787 --> 00:24:37,466
Besides, it is probably just the ghost, or whatever.

481
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:39,442
Just got a little annoyed

482
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:41,383
and probably tousled things around a bit,right?

483
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:43,169
All he's done so far has been a cry for help,

484
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:44,887
Just wait on me, okay?

485
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:46,706
Seriously, I will be there in 10 minutes.

486
00:24:46,706 --> 00:24:48,457
No, It's ok,don't worry.

487
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:51,460
It's a big deal, make me feel better.

488
00:24:53,531 --> 00:24:57,021
Hey! Did you go inside? I said to wait.

489
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:59,959
It's fine up here, Okay.

490
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:02,371
- God!  - Delia?

491
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:06,408
- Great, the electricity is out.  - What?

492
00:25:06,483 --> 00:25:08,482
That was probably just knocked out by the storm.

493
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:10,481
I mean,that can happen,right?

494
00:25:11,114 --> 00:25:13,015
Ok, well,I'm just gonna get my paperwork

495
00:25:13,015 --> 00:25:14,917
and get the hell out of here.

496
00:25:14,985 --> 00:25:18,591
OK, but I'm staying on the phone until you do, Hurry up!

497
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:22,258
- My God!  - What, what? What is it?

498
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:25,294
- I see something.  - What? Delia?

499
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:27,547
Hey, if you see something,get out of there!

500
00:25:27,547 --> 00:25:29,732
You can not see ghosts!

501
00:25:29,885 --> 00:25:31,900
Josh?

502
00:25:33,684 --> 00:25:35,678
Delia!

503
00:25:35,778 --> 00:25:38,842
Delia? Where are you?

504
00:25:38,877 --> 00:25:42,032
What happened? Where did you? Delia?

505
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:45,228
Delia, please!

506
00:25:45,263 --> 00:25:48,184
- Delia?  - I'm sorry, I'm fine.

507
00:25:48,252 --> 00:25:49,547
The phone just got knocked out of me.

508
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,842
What happened?

509
00:25:50,855 --> 00:25:55,334
The table got knocked over, only it wasn't a ghost, it was a guy.

510
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:59,162
A guy? inside the house? Look, Delia, get out of there.

511
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,847
Ok? I'm gonna call the cops.

512
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:02,465
No,no. I think it's ok.

513
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:06,863
I think I know who it is. I'm gonna call you back, ok?

514
00:26:14,044 --> 00:26:17,498
Devin! Is that you?

515
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:20,616
It's ok, honey. I just want to help you.

516
00:26:27,658 --> 00:26:29,759
- The one is there!  - Get down!

517
00:26:29,827 --> 00:26:31,428
On the ground! get on the ground now!

518
00:26:31,428 --> 00:26:33,029
Hands behind your back!

519
00:26:33,097 --> 00:26:35,165
- Wait, wait, stop!  - Down!

520
00:26:35,232 --> 00:26:38,501
Oh, please don't hurt him! I think he's the Bancroft's son!

521
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:41,171
Take a step back, ma'am. Take a step back. ok.

522
00:26:41,238 --> 00:26:43,590
You have the right to remain silent.

523
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:44,766
You give up that right, anything you say can and will be

524
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:45,942
Used against you in a court of law.

525
00:26:45,943 --> 00:26:47,677
You have a right to have an attorney present

526
00:26:47,677 --> 00:26:49,412
Both before and during any questioning.

527
00:26:53,555 --> 00:26:56,372
Apparently they didn't care that it was his house.

528
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,543
They brought him in on trespassing, breaking and entering,

529
00:26:58,578 --> 00:27:00,444
And now they're questioning him about the vandalism.

530
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:01,858
- It's the burned lawn.  - Yes.

531
00:27:02,105 --> 00:27:04,994
He's taking the blame for somebody else's handiwork.

532
00:27:05,062 --> 00:27:06,579
Well, maybe we were right.

533
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:08,097
Maybe Josh is getting exactly what he wanted-

534
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:10,934
His family back at the house one by one.

535
00:27:19,143 --> 00:27:21,010
Well, that was fast.

536
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:30,318
Delia. Look, I'm so sorry if my son gave you a scare.

537
00:27:30,353 --> 00:27:32,522
Yeah, everything ok?

538
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,858
It's just crazy they're even charging him.

539
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:37,126
Our lawyers will get that straightened out.

540
00:27:37,194 --> 00:27:40,430
He was just back on a visit, decided to crash at the old house.

541
00:27:40,498 --> 00:27:43,065
Isn't that right, Devin?

542
00:27:46,182 --> 00:27:47,844
Anyway, we didn't know, and apparently,

543
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:49,506
The lines got crossed somehow.

544
00:27:49,573 --> 00:27:51,925
Yeah, that seems to be happening a lot lately.

545
00:27:51,926 --> 00:27:54,277
Why did you go home now? Did you get a call, too?

546
00:27:54,345 --> 00:27:56,412
No, he was homesick.It happens.

547
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,242
Yeah, you got a 911 call.

548
00:27:58,242 --> 00:28:00,005
Your brother sent them to both of you.

549
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,946
How could she ...? Who are you?

550
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,853
All right, Devin. Not now okay?

551
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:06,122
Look, I need to get my son home.

552
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,124
Now, I imagine that you're here to give your statement,

553
00:28:08,192 --> 00:28:10,010
And I'm sure that you're going to explain to the police

554
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,828
About the whole misunderstanding.

555
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:19,169
This is what always happens. Dad makes things go away.

556
00:28:23,407 --> 00:28:25,859
I've been through every email in my inbox..

557
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:28,311
Nothing from Nicole.

558
00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:29,642
Can't say I blame her.

559
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:33,431
What kind of schmoe asks someone to marry them in an email?

560
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:35,118
Wait, so you think that's why she didn't respond?

561
00:28:35,186 --> 00:28:37,454
No, she responded.

562
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:39,722
Women don't not respond to marriage proposals.

563
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,135
Of course, the answer can vary

564
00:28:42,135 --> 00:28:44,481
From a giddy yes to a resounding no

565
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:47,430
Or maybe .If you're willing to work on your narcissism

566
00:28:47,498 --> 00:28:49,032
And latent mommy issues.

567
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:52,421
She was a colleague. It really didn't work out.

568
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:55,338
Look, if she did reply, Then why can't I find the email?

569
00:28:55,406 --> 00:28:57,220
Just because you lacked any sense of romance

570
00:28:57,221 --> 00:28:59,035
doesn't mean she did. Maybe she wrote you a letter.

571
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,912
No, no. I've been through all my stuff. There's nothing.

572
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,249
How about a voicemail? Have you checked your phone?

573
00:29:06,317 --> 00:29:10,153
No. I don't know the password, So I can't access the account.

574
00:29:10,221 --> 00:29:13,142
Can't? or don't want to?

575
00:29:13,177 --> 00:29:15,231
Why would I not want to?

576
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:17,453
Because if she said yes,

577
00:29:17,454 --> 00:29:19,641
You're engaged to somebody you don't even know.

578
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:22,324
And if the answer's no, you were rejected by the one person

579
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:24,973
Who could tell you who you were.

580
00:29:29,006 --> 00:29:31,374
- You are a talented shrink.  - Thanks.

581
00:29:32,034 --> 00:29:35,802
I'm not gonna tell you what to do, but just so you know,

582
00:29:35,837 --> 00:29:38,305
It only takes a social security number for the phone company

583
00:29:38,306 --> 00:29:40,774
to let you access your messages.

584
00:29:54,064 --> 00:29:56,399
So did she send him a voicemail?

585
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:58,568
I left it up to him, so I don't know.

586
00:29:58,568 --> 00:30:00,670
And even if I did, I couldn't tell you.

587
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,821
You have to have gotten some idea what he was gonna do.

588
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:05,306
Fine.

589
00:30:11,906 --> 00:30:13,306
911, what's your emergency?

590
00:30:13,324 --> 00:30:14,390
Is that the 911 call?

591
00:30:14,598 --> 00:30:16,319
Yeah, I just don't know why he's using tape calls

592
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,640
instead of talking to me.

593
00:30:19,014 --> 00:30:20,436
Well, he's been communicating with

594
00:30:20,436 --> 00:30:21,859
the brother and dad same way, too.

595
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:24,084
Yeah, the two people who were there when he died.

596
00:30:24,112 --> 00:30:25,821
What message is he sending?

597
00:30:27,017 --> 00:30:28,818
You're not gonna believe this. I just came from the house.

598
00:30:28,818 --> 00:30:30,220
The cop's searched it,

599
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,790
and they found Devin's bag pack with a big box of weedkiller in it.

600
00:30:34,471 --> 00:30:36,780
Wait, he trashed the lawn? Not the ghost?

601
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:39,220
Apparently. The detective told me that

602
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,422
he's having trouble in school,

603
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,470
that he was on the verge of being kicked out. And then 3 days ago,

604
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:45,000
He just bailed.

605
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:47,122
That's the same day that the house phone was hooked up.

606
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,657
So he must started getting phone calls and came straight here.

607
00:30:49,944 --> 00:30:50,940
Crying out for help.

608
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,950
Just like his dead brother's doing it on his behalf.

609
00:30:55,946 --> 00:30:56,930
That's it.

610
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,550
It's gotta be the first 911 call.

611
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,750
911, what's your emergency?

612
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,252
No, no, no, no, no, no!

613
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:06,240
Did you hear that?

614
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,950
His voice got louder.

615
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,790
Yeah, like he was going towards the phone.

616
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:12,390
So Mr. Bancroft isn't the one who made that call.

617
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,312
Devin was the one calling for help.

618
00:31:15,912 --> 00:31:18,010
It sounds like the old man was trying to stop him.

619
00:31:18,907 --> 00:31:20,034
Why would he do that?

620
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:21,200
Something Devin did.

621
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,340
Something that a father wouldn't want his son to get blamed for.

622
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,812
Mr. Bancroft, hi, it's Melinda Gordon.

623
00:32:45,812 --> 00:32:48,142
It's really important that we talk. It's about your son, Devin.

624
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,920
Please call back. Okay?

625
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:53,531
- Hello?  - Hey, Mel, I'm Bobby.

626
00:32:53,568 --> 00:32:55,519
Please tell me not another 911 call.

627
00:32:55,944 --> 00:32:57,624
This time a call from a neighbor.

628
00:32:57,624 --> 00:32:59,305
Said they saw a kid jumped off the roof.

629
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:01,783
Devin!

630
00:33:07,677 --> 00:33:09,380
Please, please .Please, please.

631
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,399
Help! Somebody help us!

632
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,560
Call 911!

633
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:33,650
They're on their way, a neighbor called.

634
00:33:33,853 --> 00:33:35,170
Melinda, I need you to listen carefully.

635
00:33:35,489 --> 00:33:36,949
I've reduced the shoulder dislocation,

636
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:38,410
but he needs to be immobilized.

637
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:40,884
Can you go in the house and bring me a blanket and two towels?

638
00:33:42,014 --> 00:33:43,490
And a lot of magazines.

639
00:33:44,111 --> 00:33:44,840
Magazines?

640
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:46,486
The thicker, the better. I have to build a splint.

641
00:33:46,486 --> 00:33:47,491
The arm might be broken.

642
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:52,522
- Melinda, quickly, please.  - All right!

643
00:33:54,814 --> 00:33:57,170
You gotta be still, you could still damage the nerves in your arms.

644
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,240
You're gonna be okay. Don't move.

645
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,230
You'll be all right. My name is Sam. You'll be all right.

646
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:15,400
He was lucky you were here.

647
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:17,120
Yeah, I guess so.

648
00:34:17,406 --> 00:34:19,058
Where'd you learn to make field splints?

649
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:25,450
Guess I just see stuffs on TV.

650
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:31,810
So how is that feel?

651
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,580
He needed help, I helped him.

652
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,240
How did it feel to remember? I mean,

653
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,277
that stuff had to come from some place.

654
00:34:38,315 --> 00:34:39,765
I know I was an architect.

655
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:41,216
Why would I know about emergency medicine?

656
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,620
I know that you feel strange, but it's progress.

657
00:34:44,944 --> 00:34:46,643
I mean, you have to believe that

658
00:34:46,643 --> 00:34:48,343
it's all gonna come back now, right?

659
00:34:58,148 --> 00:34:59,575
It was an accident. He fell.

660
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,740
What was he doing up there?

661
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,280
What was he even doing at the house?

662
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:08,350
And vandalizing other people's lawns?

663
00:35:10,445 --> 00:35:13,170
Doug, he needs help. Can you see that?

664
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:15,443
Someone has seen it.

665
00:35:17,948 --> 00:35:19,835
Someone who loves you very much.

666
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,290
Your brother.

667
00:35:25,262 --> 00:35:27,703
I'm sorry, Ms. Gordon. Isn't it?

668
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:30,269
This really is not a good time for visitors.

669
00:35:30,288 --> 00:35:32,044
Yeah, I couldn't disagree more.

670
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,504
Josh's been waiting to see you all together.

671
00:35:34,504 --> 00:35:36,598
It's something he's been wanting for quite some time.

672
00:35:38,572 --> 00:35:41,750
If there's anything you want to say, Josh, this is your chance.

673
00:35:42,817 --> 00:35:44,380
Tell them to stop fighting.

674
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,188
Please, not now. Okay?

675
00:35:46,216 --> 00:35:47,239
Josh ...

676
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:48,862
Tell them to count to 3 fingers.

677
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,530
He wants you to count to 3 fingers.

678
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,478
Well, that's what Uncle Chip said

679
00:35:53,478 --> 00:35:54,807
whenever he got on fight with Aunt Pansy.

680
00:35:55,474 --> 00:35:58,470
You know,3 fingers? How much liquor to put in your drink.

681
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,650
It's what Uncle Chip would say to Aunt Pansy.

682
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,540
Oh. My God.

683
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,074
And, and he's really still here?

684
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,470
Josh! What is he saying?

685
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,519
Why can they just talk?

686
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,400
Why can't they just say what they're feeling?

687
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,987
He wished you guys could just talk.

688
00:36:24,107 --> 00:36:27,113
It's been really hard for him watching his whole family fall apart.

689
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,626
Over a lie.

690
00:36:32,654 --> 00:36:34,280
What? What lie?

691
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,553
Josh, if you're really here,

692
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:40,342
then I know you'll want what is best for us, for all of us.

693
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,450
Dad, stop it! You're not helping!

694
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,850
It was too late to help me then, and I know you were trying,

695
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,320
but you're not helping!

696
00:36:47,635 --> 00:36:48,903
You're not!

697
00:36:54,227 --> 00:36:55,490
It was me.

698
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,020
What?

699
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,030
That accident. It wasn't dad's fault, mom. It was mine.

700
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:12,640
Dad wasn't even there.

701
00:37:13,229 --> 00:37:15,870
Dad was inside, working. The driving lesson was over.

702
00:37:18,565 --> 00:37:21,030
Josh was begging for a dirt riding,

703
00:37:21,382 --> 00:37:23,020
so I let him sit with me.

704
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,120
Come on! Go faster!

705
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,995
- No! - Come on, Dev. Let me steer.

706
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:33,420
Then he wanted to steer, and I kept telling him no, but ...

707
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,679
I won't listen.

708
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:40,911
So I grabbed the wheel.

709
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:43,435
- Stop!  - Devin, let me steer!

710
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:45,535
- Josh  - Come on!

711
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:47,235
No!

712
00:37:47,235 --> 00:37:49,435
Josh!

713
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:01,609
Josh! Josh!

714
00:38:02,412 --> 00:38:04,590
Dad heard the screams,and he came out and found us.

715
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:16,490
- 911, what's your emergency?  - No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

716
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:18,650
He grabbed my phone when I called 911.

717
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,975
Josh...

718
00:38:22,985 --> 00:38:24,117
Then called himself.

719
00:38:24,117 --> 00:38:26,650
Made me promise to say I was inside studying.

720
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,190
Why?

721
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,890
Why did you lie to me?

722
00:38:33,402 --> 00:38:35,410
Because I thought...

723
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,300
You'd already lost one child.

724
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,410
You don't want me to... lose the other?

725
00:38:45,336 --> 00:38:47,610
Because you thought that I couldn't forgive him.

726
00:38:48,163 --> 00:38:49,891
You didn't give her a chance.

727
00:38:52,557 --> 00:38:53,965
And ever since that,

728
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,313
The lie, it's been killing me, Dad.

729
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:03,495
- I know what I did was... - Devin

730
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,890
It was a mistake.

731
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,130
A stupid mistake.

732
00:39:09,873 --> 00:39:11,873
But lying to mom about it made me feel...

733
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,675
Unforgivable.

734
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:25,571
But I'm the one who should be mad at.

735
00:39:25,815 --> 00:39:27,693
Not Devin, not Dad.

736
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:30,680
It was my mistake.

737
00:39:32,187 --> 00:39:34,100
Josh feels like it was his fault.

738
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,174
Josh, no!

739
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:36,620
It was!

740
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:38,746
And it racked everything.

741
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:43,046
You guys are all apart now because of me.

742
00:39:44,428 --> 00:39:46,503
He feels like he destroyed your family.

743
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,630
Josh. It was nobody's fault.

744
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:53,940
And I love you. Both of you.

745
00:40:01,427 --> 00:40:02,601
Even if I ...

746
00:40:04,084 --> 00:40:06,113
Even if I have to go away?

747
00:40:07,478 --> 00:40:09,500
He wants to know if you will still love him

748
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,870
even if he has to go away

749
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:17,300
Yes.

750
00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:19,519
Even if you'd leave us.

751
00:40:23,332 --> 00:40:24,694
I saw that once before.

752
00:40:27,557 --> 00:40:28,684
Is that for me?

753
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,815
But I don't want them to be alone.

754
00:40:35,754 --> 00:40:38,082
He doesn't want you all to be alone.

755
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:44,213
We're not alone.

756
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:51,493
Because we have each other.

757
00:40:52,976 --> 00:40:55,361
And we will always be a family.

758
00:40:55,605 --> 00:40:56,601
No matter what.

759
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:08,068
He's gone.

760
00:41:23,031 --> 00:41:26,102
All right.It's less than the asking price, but it's an offer,

761
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:27,701
and they obviously love the place,

762
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:29,580
because it's their third time coming back.

763
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,939
Third time? You own there. They are hooked.

764
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:34,140
Listen, if I make the sale,

765
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,310
I want you to celebrate with me at the SPA. It is my treat.

766
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,751
I totally owe you one.

767
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,597
It's a deal.

768
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,991
And speaking of coming back,

769
00:41:42,188 --> 00:41:44,252
Has there been any memory breakthrough for Sam?

770
00:41:44,288 --> 00:41:47,520
I'm not sure, but you know what?

771
00:41:47,557 --> 00:41:49,610
I just feel like Jim is in there somewhere, waiting to come out.

772
00:41:50,499 --> 00:41:52,537
And now is the perfect time to find out.

773
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:54,330
I want details. Call me later, bye.

774
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:57,084
Sam!

775
00:41:59,118 --> 00:41:59,832
Sam?

776
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:01,980
Oh, hey. Hi, Melinda.

777
00:42:02,178 --> 00:42:03,267
- Hey...here. - Thanks.

778
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,180
Seems like you have a lot of new mind lately.

779
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,082
Yeah.

780
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,980
I mean it's just a lot of stuff that doesn't fit.

781
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,326
Shoulder pain, weird violent memories and

782
00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:15,035
the inexplicable medical knowledge.

783
00:42:15,063 --> 00:42:16,453
But you know what I'm going to do what you told me.

784
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:17,843
I'm gonna find somebody who understands me.

785
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:19,121
Well, that's great.

786
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:21,062
I mean, Eli said that he wanted you to try

787
00:42:21,062 --> 00:42:23,084
the past life regression therapy. So...

788
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:25,050
I think I'm gonna talk to somebody who ...

789
00:42:25,506 --> 00:42:26,940
actually knows where the stuff is coming from.

790
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:28,180
Like?

791
00:42:29,134 --> 00:42:29,960
Nicole.

792
00:42:30,787 --> 00:42:32,777
I mean I was with her for almost a decade. So...

793
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,720
You know,who would know me better?

794
00:42:35,957 --> 00:42:37,385
That's a good question.

795
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,150
Yeah, so I'm gonna go to Raleigh. Thanks.

796
00:42:41,029 --> 00:42:42,447
So that's what all this is for?

797
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:43,405
Yeah.

798
00:42:43,805 --> 00:42:46,894
I'm leaving tomorrow. I don't know how long I'm gonna be gone.

799
00:42:56,271 --> 00:42:57,463
Wish me luck.

800
00:42:59,837 --> 00:43:00,790
See you.
