00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,690
Previously on ghost whisperer...

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,070
- No!
- I will always love you, melinda.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,610
Not you.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,670
You have to cross over.

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,900
I don't want to.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,020
*****

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,470
You're back.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,330
Do i know you?

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,740
I see the same guy that you
see-- different hair, nose, eyes.

10
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,740
It's not jim.

11
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,180
I just know what i see when i look in
those eyes, and jim is in there somewhere.

12
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,860
Wait. You're not gonna tell me you
think i'm your husband reincarnated,

13
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,580
Because you're the only sane
person i've met since i woke up.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,030
I bought that less than a month ago.

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,270
Nicole...**********

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,890
Do you know how lucky you are?

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,210
You are gonna get a second
shot at your one true love.

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,880
Seems like you've had a
lot on your mind lately.

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,310
Yeah. I mean, there's just a lot of stuff that doesn't
fit-- shoulder pain, the weird, violent memories.

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,690
You know, i'm gonna do what you told me.

21
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,920
- I'm gonna find somebody who understands.
- Like?

22
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,240
Nicole. You know, who
would know me better?

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,380
That's a good question.

24
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,790
Ok, i have silverware, candlesticks.

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,170
What about the china?

26
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,240
Is it too middle-aged?

27
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,630
It's perfect. Why are you so nervous?

28
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,670
I'm not nervous.

29
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,110
It's just been ages since i've
thrown a dinner party and--

30
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:20,090
Twice that long since i've seen marla and
jody, so, ok, i guess i'm a little nervous.

31
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,570
Here's a thought.

32
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,270
You could just cancel or go
out, you know, without me.

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,630
It's one dinner party.

34
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,200
Besides, you and eli are
gonna have a ball mocking me.

35
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,340
Yeah, friday night with mom and her
high school theater geek friends.

36
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,010
Good times.

37
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,230
You invited eli?

38
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,400
Well, he makes a living
out of talking to strangers.

39
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,800
Wish you would reconsider.

40
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,460
Sorry. Told you. Plans.

41
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:47,080
Tearing your hair out while sam goes and visits
his fiancee in raleigh does not constitute plans.

42
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,740
Actually i'm going with him.

43
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,100
You saw him remember
his paramedic skills.

44
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:58,260
I mean, his memory' coming back, so now
he just needs a crash course in jim clancy.

45
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,750
A crash course?

46
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,820
Look, when i was
opening the shop--

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,250
Jim and i used to
love taking road trips.

48
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,450
We'd hit all the estate sales,
antique shops, listen to music,

49
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,770
Play games, stop by our
favorite restaurants.

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,490
So you think by recreating all
of that, it might jog something?

51
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,310
Look, sam thinks he should know nicole,

52
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,260
So he'll wanna believe whatever she
says, which'll only confuse him more.

53
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,650
You could just tell him the truth.

54
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,940
Yeah, i tried that once, and he
looked at me like i was mpletely nuts.

55
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,480
I just have to get him to remember jim, you
know, but gently, so he doesn't get scared away.

56
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,890
The heating guys are
coming first thing tomorrow.

57
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,780
Could you swing by the
house and let them in for me?

58
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,730
Sure. What time?

59
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,860
7 a.m.

60
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,130
Maybe i should just cancel.

61
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,470
No. I'll do it.

62
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,490
Well, that's nice. Thanks.

63
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,980
Oh, i get it.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,570
You're thinking maybe you
should spend the night, housesit,

65
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,490
and be there in the morning
for the heating guys.

66
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,180
Yeah, and i have an english lit paper due on
monday, so i could use the peace and quiet.

67
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,950
It would help me out.

68
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,950
Fine. Fine. Abandon your own mother.

69
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,380
So how did you talk
sam into letting you go?

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,030
Well, i haven't yet.

71
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,700
But trust me. I have a foolproof plan.

72
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,450
Wait, you--you bought a
garage full of furniture?

73
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,460
Uh, antiques. I got 'em online.

74
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,420
Now you're gonna drive
down to raleigh, too?

75
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,480
Uh, new hope, actually. It's
about an hour from there.

76
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,330
Anyway, with the price
of gas, i just thought--

77
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,430
aw, melinda, i don't know.

78
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,780
I mean, nicole called me and left me a message
the day before the accident saying, Yeah,

79
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:33,590
she'd meet me if i was serious about the proposal,
but i mean, now she must think i got cold feet.

80
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,110
She won't return my calls.

81
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,850
She's changed her cellphone number.

82
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,260
I just don't know how she's
gonna react, and if you're there--

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,930
Well, i could make myself scarce, you know, while you
guys are talking, if you need to reconnect, i mean.

84
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,040
Melinda, i just owe her
an explanation, right?

85
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,800
Maybe she could explain
some things for me.

86
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,870
Like?

87
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,910
You know, like how i got
all that medical knowledge.

88
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,170
You know, if we do share the driving,
could get there early tomorrow morning,

89
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,210
And i could just use the
change of scenery, so...

90
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,550
You and me, a road trip?

91
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,820
All right. What the heck, huh? Why not?

92
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,230
But, um...

93
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,120
Is all that stuff in the
garage gonna fit in my pickup

94
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,680
probably not.

95
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,330
Which is why i got us a truck.

96
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,850
So you're cool if i just
stay for drinks, right?

97
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,640
If you want me to beg, i'll beg.

98
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,640
I doubt that i have anything in common with
these girls, and you--you can talk to anybody.

99
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,540
Yeah, but usually i get paid for it.

100
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,930
Well, i really should get goin'.

101
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,540
Traitor.

102
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,800
I got it, ok?

103
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,570
Well, hello.

104
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,320
Jode, you didn't tell me
delia was seeing someone.

105
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,220
I'm marla, and this is jody.

106
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,290
I'm eli.

107
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,980
Delia and i are just
friends. We're not dating.

108
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,110
But how 'bout you two ladies?

109
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,400
Oh, we're not dating.

110
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,570
Deally!

111
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,590
Oh, my god! Look at you!

112
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,110
I know.

113
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,250
Oh, my god. You look beautiful.

114
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,390
I see you've met eli.

115
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,470
Yes, we did.

116
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,520
Oh, eli, would you mind
opening one of these?

117
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,550
- Sure, my pleasure.
- Thank you.

118
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,210
And who is this?

119
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,710
Ah, this is ned, my son.

120
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,110
He's actually going out, but he
wanted to stay and meet you guys.

121
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,850
Oh, i wish you could
meet my daughter carly.

122
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,740
You'd like her.

123
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,540
Maybe next time.

124
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,710
Oh, god. It's official.

125
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,560
We are now our parents' age
when we were in high school.

126
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,550
This calls for alcohol.

127
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,140
Well, it was nice to meet you. Have fun.

128
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,560
- Ok.
- Bye.

129
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,500
We've got 25 years of catching up to do.

130
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,550
Logan, i already texted dylan.

131
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,920
I can't go out with you guys.

132
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,860
B-because i'm
housesitting and--

133
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,560
logan, hang on a sec.

134
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,540
Hello?

135
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,670
Whoever's there, melinda isn't home.

136
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,820
And since i can't see or
hear you, maybe you should--

137
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,660
- logan.
- Gotta call you back.

138
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,750
What are you guys doin' here?

139
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,590
You couldn't come to the party,
so we brought the party to you.

140
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,320
wait. How much furniture did you buy?

141
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,730
An entire estate sale.

142
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,550
I didn't know how big
of a truck we needed.

143
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,460
If you wanted somethin' smaller,
you should have called before.

144
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,000
No, no, no, no. It's
fine. 'Cause you know what?

145
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,920
We might go to other estate sales, maybe even
thrift shops. I mean, doesn't that sound like fun?

146
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,990
Yeah. I mean, we are in
kind of a hurry, i mean.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,710
What is this stuff?

148
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,250
Just in case we get bored on the road.

149
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,590
- Come on. We'll put our bags in the back.
- Yeah.

150
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,290
You ok?

151
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,330
That is such a loud door.

152
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,630
You can see me, can't you?

153
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,340
You can!

154
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,960
Thank god! Where are you people headed?

155
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,280
- Raleigh.
- Gesundheit.

156
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,230
I call shotgun.

If you were in nicole's shoes, you'd
want an explanation, too, right?

161
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,060
My name is frank, frank whitaker.

162
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,770
If you'll just talk to me.

163
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,130
Not now.

164
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,190
Why not now?

165
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,830
She's probably angry as hell
that i flaked on her, again.

166
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,530
Well, hopefully she'll understand.

167
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,980
- You ok?
- Yeah. Just stretching.

168
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,180
How 'bout some music for the road?

169
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,230
Oh, this song, it was popular when we...

170
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,880
I--sorry--moved
to grandview.

171
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,790
It was playing when i found the
vacant storefront on town square.

172
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,160
Oh, i get it. You like him.

173
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,680
What, are you married, dirced? What?

174
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,280
Look, i'm not going anywhere, so if
you wanna get me out of your hair--

175
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,630
uh, you know what?I just remembered there's
a phone call that i have to make, so...

176
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,940
Oh, for cryin' out loud.

177
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,460
Hey, frank. It's melinda.

178
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,050
Got your voice mail, but it was a
little garbled, so what were you saying?

179
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,080
Thank you.

180
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,910
I rented this truck to haul
some stuff to a coin show.

181
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm a numismatist.

182
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:59,220
Anyway, i was fixing a flat on the shoulder
outside charlotte when the jack gave away.

183
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,490
Man, did that hurt.

184
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,140
Ok, you know what?

185
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,190
The reception's a little rough out here,
so if you could just get to the point.

186
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,630
Ok, there's a 1943 copper penny
fell into a crack ar the cargo door.

187
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,500
It's worth a fortune.

188
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,610
I--i been tryin' to pick it up
forever, but, hey, watch this.

189
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,310
My wife could use the money.

190
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,810
I need you to find that
penny and send it to her.

191
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,330
June whitaker on allenwood in raleigh.

192
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,860
She's in the book.
Will you do that for me?

193
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,060
Be happy to help.

194
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,800
Ohh, thank you.

195
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,980
Well, it's about damn time. Ciao.

196
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,760
There weren't enough guys in drama,

197
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:50,300
So we did some gender bending with
that--that one act by that french guy.

198
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,310
Moliere.

199
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,260
Yes!

200
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,880
Thank god somebody has
a functioning memory.

201
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,940
Anyway, marla was playing
valere, the male lover,

202
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,690
And when she kissed
deally, the place went nuts.

203
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,700
Oh, i could imagine.

204
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,280
God, memory lane's
such a dead-end street.

205
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,730
Let's party already.

206
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,650
Eli, i'm so glad you stayed.

207
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,170
Oh, wouldn't have missed it.

208
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,460
Deally, more champagne?

209
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,740
No, no, no. Just 2 is my limit.

210
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,160
You know, motherhood and all.

211
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,070
You never
know when--

212
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,330
that's more like it.

213
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,230
- Deal, d-did you just put
this on? - No. No, i didn't.

214
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,240
Hey, watch it.

215
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,660
This was playing at the wrap party.

216
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,430
Yeah. That was the
night that, uh--

217
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,210
excuse me.

218
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,440
Hello. Yeah.
Hi, mrs.--

219
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,070
what?

220
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,760
Who are all these people?

221
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,560
Your party must have gone viral.

222
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,310
- This isn't my party.
- Really?

223
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,140
- Then whose is it?
- Mom.

224
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,560
Ok, guys, party's over.

225
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,140
Everybody can start cleaning up!

226
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,800
And nobody is leaving
without a designated driver!

227
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,940
- Mom, listen-- -
no, you listen to me.

228
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,640
You wanna make some excuses,
you can save your breath.

229
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,370
Now, get to work. You're
comin' home with me.

230
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,860
- But this
isn'my-- - now!

231
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,240
Let me just tell you what happened.

232
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,190
No, i know exactly what happened.

233
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,180
You violated my trust and melinda's.

234
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,260
I told dylan that i couldn't go out tonight because
i was housesitting, and then the next thing--

235
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,070
You let them in!

236
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,000
They brought alcohol.

237
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,970
- Were you drinking?
- No.

238
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,830
Will you just chill for a second?

239
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,680
Chill? Come back here,
i'm talking to you.

240
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,420
Please shut up.

241
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,420
Don't be slamming doors!

242
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,900
- I didn't.
- I did.

243
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,060
Stop, ok. Just stop.

244
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,460
You need to go to bed, and i need to
think clearly about your punishment.

245
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,570
Delia rayburn, the party animal?

246
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,770
No way.

247
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,590
Oh, my god.

248
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,830
How are you?

249
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,090
That was quick. Is that her?

250
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,970
No, her roommate, uh, cheryl.

251
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,660
Uh, nicole took off 2 days
after i never showed up,

252
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,940
and then she made cheryl promise
she'd never tell me where she was.

253
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,350
I'm sorry. So it's a dead end.

254
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,920
Not exactly.

255
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,760
Cheryl gave me nicole's new number.

256
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,850
I didn't wanna do this over the phone.

257
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,210
- hey, it's me. Leave a message.
- Voice mail.

258
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,570
Nicole, hi. It's sam.

259
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm really sorry i never explained to
you why i didn't show up, and i just--

260
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,930
I had this accident, and my
life's been messed up ever since.

261
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,700
Uh, i just would really like a
chance to explain what happened.

262
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,460
Well, i hope to hear from you. Bye.

263
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,570
Hey, you're not
goin' anywhere until--

264
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,280
melinda's heater guy, remember.

265
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,330
Well, i want you home
right after so we can talk.

266
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,410
Whatever.

267
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,890
Brightness.

268
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,710
When did you get so... Old?

269
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,370
Um, is somebody here?

270
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,030
God.

271
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,770
Come on, doobie-ah.

272
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,310
You know, loosen up a little.

273
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,580
Have some fun.

274
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,730
That'll work.

275
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,090
Ok, where's the ghost?

276
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,650
Uh, this is me you're talking to.

277
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,740
Sorry. I'm not a morning persrson.

278
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,980
Well, it's in here somewhere.

279
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,730
Well, i believe "it's" a she.

280
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,350
I heard her talking
at dinner last night.

281
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,210
Teenager, kind of snarky.

282
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,420
Well, do you think ned brought
home some rand ghost girl?

283
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,130
No. I believe she came with your
friends, looking for a party.

284
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,860
Uh, hello?

285
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:17,420
Whver you are, i can hear
you, maybe even help you.

286
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,480
Well, if she's here, she's not talkin'.

287
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,770
Oh, my god.

288
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,510
That song that played last night.

289
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,730
Angie hollensbach.

290
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,010
She was a girl that we
went to high school with.

291
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,310
I had drama class with her.

292
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,490
She loved to party so...

293
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,090
If it really is angie, you
gotta help me get rid of her.

294
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,870
That girl was nothing but trouble, just always
wasted, and if she's hangin' around ned--

295
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,090
How'd she die?

296
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,140
Uh, she got really messed up on
our senior wrap night, and, uh,

297
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,690
She decided to walk home, and then the next
day, we heard that she got hit by a car.

298
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,680
Anyway, that is not the
only reason why i called you.

299
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,990
No, thanks. Makes me paranoid.

300
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,710
No. I-- i found this
here. I know my son.

301
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,660
And this is not like him, and angie the pothead
just happened to show up at my house the night

302
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,710
Before i find drugs in it.

303
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,030
Oh, sure. Blame me. You suck!

304
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,890
Kids today. Kids yesterday.

305
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,290
This is nuts. You are a therapist.

306
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,450
Ghost or no ghost, how--how am i
supposed to confront ned about this?

307
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,490
First of all, i wouldn't confront
anyone until i was sure it was his.

308
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,260
What? You had the banger
sisters over here last night.

309
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,780
What makes you think they didn't
bring the ghost and the ganja?

310
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,890
Find something?

311
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,700
See a penny, pick it up.

312
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,810
That's old. That could
be worth somethin'.

313
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:58,740
Yeah. I have a--a friend who's a collector,
so whenever i find anything, i send it to her.

314
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,710
You for real?

315
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,880
It's a lot of stuff.

316
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,150
It's nicole.
I should, uh--

317
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,690
Yeah, thanks for callin' me back.

318
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,710
Nah, i know. I know.

319
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,090
I really owe you an explanation, but
this is gonna sound completely crazy.

320
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,650
Look, i was in an accident
on my bike-- uh, motorcycle...

321
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,750
Put that down.

322
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,140
- Anything at all.
- Sorry.

323
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,830
You know what?I'll find a really
nice place for your things--

324
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,640
but you should go into the light.

325
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:46,820
On her deathbed i'd be buried with
her brooch, and my sister--heh.

326
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,630
My senile sister forgot.

327
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,670
I'm sorry about that.

328
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,560
But if you've
already been buried--

329
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,150
my funeral's tomorrow,
silly.I'm at callaway mortuary.

330
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,080
Open casket.

331
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,320
And that, um-- the
little treble clef.

332
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,020
Yes, thank you, dear.

333
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,560
but you're the only person
truly who can help me remem--

334
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,330
yeah.

335
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,760
Ok. You, too.

336
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,720
So how did that go?

337
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,280
She told me to have a nice life.

338
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,200
That's cold.

339
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,980
I don't know. I wouldn't blame her.

340
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,970
Why should she believe me?

341
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,400
I'm sorry.

342
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,720
Well, i should get the truck
loaded. It's a-- it's a long drive.

343
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,490
Ok. I'm so sorry to bother you.

344
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,090
Yeah, it was, uh, great
seeing you, too. I'll call you.

345
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,440
No, i promise. Really. Ok. Bye.

346
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:58,970
Marla and jody both said no, so
that leaves ned-- my worst nightmare.

347
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,140
So if it is ned's, any chance angie would
have led you to that joint on purpose?

348
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,670
Well, if she did, she
did it to stir up trouble.

349
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,080
That was her specialty.

350
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,280
She might just be a nuisance ghost, or
she's stuck in some juvenile defiance thing

351
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,190
And acting out through ned,

352
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,400
or she was thinking you may be
a little more shall we say...

353
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,330
Simpatico.

354
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,040
Where did you get my yearbook?

355
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,450
At your house this morning.

356
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,260
I've been reading what people wrote
to you, and from what i can gather,

357
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,020
it sounds like angie wasn't the
only one who liked to par-tay.

358
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,240
Yeah. Well, one of us grew out of it.

359
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,180
And the other one died.

360
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,530
All the more reason i don't want ned
to make the same mistakes that i did.

361
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,290
Then you need to have a sit-down,
get him to open up about it.

362
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:42,960
Easier
said--

363
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,000
delia, if you get involved with
this now, you can nip it in the bud.

364
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,740
So to speak.

365
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,640
Why would i lie about amnesia?

366
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,430
I mean, who even gets amnesia?

367
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,170
It happens obviously.

368
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,490
Here i am goin' on about things when you're tryin'
to pay respects to your mother's friend and--

369
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,360
no, it'ok. I hardly know...

370
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,780
Myrna very well.

371
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,460
Um, my mom just told me that she
died and asked me to stop by, so...

372
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,680
You didn't know her very well?

373
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,390
Wh-why do you keep doin' these
random nice little things for people?

374
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,410
I mean like this, and
you mailed that penny--

375
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,720
karma.You know, do unto
others, that whole thing.

376
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,790
Oh, yeah? Well, what
would you do in my shoes?

377
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,240
Oh, that's--
that's hard to say.

378
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,600
I don't believe you.

379
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,700
I think if you left somebody hanging, you'd
wanna go see them face to face, wouldn't you?

380
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,300
So that's what i'm gonna do.

381
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,690
Ok.Ok,
but--

382
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,970
but first, i'm starving, and i
know this great ace near here.

383
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,590
Do you-- do you
like mexican?

384
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,680
I don't remember.

385
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,270
Something tells me you're gonna love it.

386
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,460
So, um, just--just wait
for me in the truck, and--

387
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,560
yeah.

388
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,520
They did a lovely job, didn't they?

389
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,920
Except for that hair.

390
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,620
Here you go.

391
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,920
Do you see a light?

392
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:19,380
I do now. Bless you.

393
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,280
Is everything ok?

394
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,220
Heating's fixed. Finished my paper.

395
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,650
No parties.

396
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,900
Great. So let's talk.

397
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,460
Figured.

398
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,550
Look, those kids just
showed up, i swear,

399
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,170
And the next thing i knew,
it was out of control.

400
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,040
Ok. I believe you about that.

401
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,610
What does that mean?

402
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,940
Look, you know you can talk
to me about anything, right?

403
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:06,240
For example, if you're into any
kind of drugs, you can tell me.

404
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,120
What? I'm not doing drugs.

405
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:14,410
I know. Hypothetically, if you
were, you could come and talk to me.

406
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,760
After the way you acted last night?

407
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,990
Hypothetically, probably not.

408
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,200
I was angry.

409
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,840
Obviously you still are.

410
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,950
Yes. Sometimes people make bad
choices just so they can fit in,

411
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,170
And if your friends are
gettin' high or smokin' pot,

412
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,630
You need to tell me about that.

413
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,040
I'm not smoking anything.

414
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,020
Really?

415
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,560
Then why did i find
a joint in your room?

416
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,970
It's so after-school special.

417
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,060
Are you kidding me?

418
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,510
Maybe one of your friends brought it.

419
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,170
Well, they didn't.

420
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,910
- If you would just be
honest-- - i am.It wasn't me.

421
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,690
- Best sangria in the world...
- Yeah?

422
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,890
- From my very limited experience.
- All right.

423
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,240
Well? Was i right?

424
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,470
Yeah. I mean, it's good.
It's nd of sweet, though.

425
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,750
I'll probably end up drinkin'
beer with dinner. Sorry.

426
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,530
Hey, i'm-- did i see you put something
in your mom's friend's casket?

427
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,580
That. Yeah, it was a brooch.

428
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,350
I--i guess the piece was
really important to her.

429
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,500
So i am hungry. Are you hungry?

430
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,830
Yeah. Yeah, i am hungry. I'm hungry.
You've been here before, right?

431
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,370
- Several times.
- With jim, huh?

432
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,870
- Sorry. I keep doin' that.
- No, it's fine.

433
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:34,720
Look, i know that jim would want
me to be happy, and i will be,

434
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,390
So in his honor, i just
keep moving forward.

435
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,840
- All right.
- Great.

436
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,390
World's greatest mole sauce.

437
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,360
- Oh, yeah?Ok.Try it.
- Yeah.

438
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,150
All right. You're right.
That is really--that's...

439
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,080
Wait a minute. I've--
i've had this before.

440
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,740
I've tasted this before more than once.

441
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,850
I-i'm guessing that you have.

442
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,850
- Are you ok?
- Yeah. It's just maybe a kind of a sensory overload.

443
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,370
You know, the music, the food.

444
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,520
Melinda, i've--i've
been here.

445
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,370
Really?

446
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,400
Uh, i mean, do you think
that-- you think you and i...

447
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,050
Yes?

448
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,780
Might have been here at the same time?

449
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:32,810
You know, like, uh, me and nicole and-- and you and
jim sittin' at--i mean, that'd be a weird thing, huh?

450
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,100
I mean, what a small world.

451
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,260
Wh-what's wrong?

452
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,840
Oh, no. I've gotta be allergic
to this. Excuse me. Sorry.

453
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,480
Excuse me, does anyone
have antihistamines?

454
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,910
<i>prty2******</i>

455
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,560

460
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,570

00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,450

Drina. Drina.

465
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,740

- What about drina?

470
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,400
Su nueva novia...

471
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,870
She says, "su nueva novia..."

472
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,450
What?

473
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,590
Es una perra callejera.

474
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,640
Uh, "es una perra..." What?

475
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,620
- Ahh, did she just...
- Callejera.

476
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,700
Who does she think she is?

477
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,740
You're saying my girlfriend
looks like a hooker?

478
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:16,480
Oh, no.Uh,
drina--

479
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,930
drina's been dead for 2
years. Who the hell are you?

480
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,500
Hey, hey, what's goin' on? There's
gotta be a misunderstanding, right?

481
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,790
Oh, yeah. Let me clear it up.

482
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,630
Hey, you know, there really
has been a misunderstanding.

483
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,090
Hey, are you ok?

484
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,480
Sam!

485
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,010
Sam. Hey, are you ok?

486
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:48,870
Yeah. You know, a couple stitches, a tetanus shot,
but, um, you know, you should see the other guy.

487
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,040
Like, speaking of which,
what happened back there?

488
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:55,020
Well, let's just say i won't be
using my high school spanish again.

489
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,340
- Do you smell that?
- What? Disinfectant?

490
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,900
No, it just... Seems familiar.

491
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,120
Try to open your eyes if you can.

492
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,030
Sam? Sam.

493
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,330
Uh, sorry. I just got a
little lightheaded there.

494
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,560
Does your shoulder hurt?

495
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,080
Yeah, like hell.

496
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,600
I just had the weirdest memory.

497
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,550
What? What did you remember?

498
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,410
Something that's not possible.

499
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,810
Look, this is gonna sound nuts,
but i think i remember getting shot.

500
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,630
Dinner's almost--
where you going?

501
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
Out.

502
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,040
That cracking sound you hear
is the ice you're standing on.

503
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,110
Relax. It's just a party.

504
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,270
Are you forgetting what
happened last night?

505
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,520
How could i? Am i grounded?

506
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,250
You're this close.

507
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,760
What is goin' on, ned?

508
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,440
Why don't you just talk to me?

509
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,310
You wanna talk? Fine.

510
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,790
Let's talk about this.

511
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,810
- Yeah.
- Hey, delia, it's marla.

512
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,790
Look, about your call earlier,
i'm pretty embarrassed.

513
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,610
I was with my daughter, so
i sort of told a little fib.

514
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,130
Anyway, yeah, the joint's
mine. I'm sorry. Just...

515
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,270
You're mad at me about something that
wasn't even my fault when the whole time

516
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,270
you were here getting
high with your friends.

517
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,020
No, i wasn't, and i-i'm sorry
that i accused you, but--

518
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,300
Mom, your friend angie's here, too.

519
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,330
She showed me your yearbook, so i don't think
you wanna be lecturing me about anything.

520
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:53,280
Ned, angie was always a troublemaker,
and she still is, and for some reason,

521
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,180
She is trying to get
between the two of us.

522
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,730
Your friends called you doobie-ah.

523
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,200
You're all over me about something i'm
not even doing when obviously you did.

524
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,710
Hey, this is not about me.

525
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,940
So you're saying you did.

526
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,390
No.I am
saying--

527
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,490
now who's not being honest?

528
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,720
Now who's grounded?

529
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,710
Why don't you just go into your room until we
can have a rational conversation about this.

530
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,190
Sounds like never to me.

531
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,400
I know it must be painful, but it's...

532
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:23,330
A good sign you're remembering.

533
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,840
Yeah, but remembering what?

534
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:30,630
Everything my family tells me, none of
this fits-- the emergency medical knowledge,

535
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,670
The taste of food i'm
allergic to, getting shot.

536
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,680
Melinda, i feel like i'm losing my mind.

537
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,000
Or maybe you're finding it.

538
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,700
I-it's possible.

539
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,980
Maybe you're trying to
remember the wrong life.

540
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,680
What do you mean?

541
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,340
Well, you have this idea ofho you are
based on what other people have told you,

542
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,900
So that's the sam that you're trying
to get back to but--but maybe just...

543
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:00,090
Maybe there's this-- this whole
other person inside you entirely.

544
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:04,260
Wait a minute. Eli talked about some
kind of regression back to a past life.

545
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,490
- Is that what you mean?
- Maybe.

546
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,940
If you just open your mind...

547
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,620
And your heart, maybe
you'll find the key.

548
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,570
You mean a key like a place...

549
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,990
Or a person.

550
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,140
Sure.

551
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,840
Someone who's always been there for me,

552
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,880
someone who knew me
better than anyone else.

553
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,960
That's right.

554
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,190
It's gotta be nicole.

555
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,770
******

556
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,530
Nicole, hi. It's sam.

557
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,700
Look, i'm sorry i keep
leaving you these messages,

558
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:58,930
But i mean, everything i told you about the
accident and my memory, please, it's all true.

559
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,550
And i was hoping maybe
you would help me...

560
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,100
Nicole, no, it's too much of a
burden to put on you to ask you to

561
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,140
help me with all that after
what i put you through, so...

562
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:24,400
If you need to move on, maybe--maybe
that's better for both of us.

563
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,790
Be well.

564
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,170
You're not answering your phone.

565
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,680
I left my cell in the car.
Rry. Did you talk to ned?

566
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,730
More like yelled with.

567
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,590
- So you got angry.
- I know. I know.

568
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,530
We both did, and then he busted me.

569
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,470
And thanks to marla and jody,
all of my credibility is gone.

570
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,790
Parents don't have credibility.

571
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:04,370
Hi, angie. M eli.

572
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,520
Yeah, the shrink. I know.

573
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,200
Nice to meet you, too.

574
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:12,290
- Your parents tried counseling?
- Yeah. Look how well that turned out.

575
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,100
Now delia's just like them.

576
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,590
She says you're acting like her parents.

577
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,080
Why does she care?

578
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,660
Because you used to be so cool.

579
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:25,860
She's hangin' around because she thought you
were cool, but now she thinks you're a hypocrite.

580
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,010
Yes.

581
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:31,510
I lied to my son, because i'm old
enough now to want to protect him,

582
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:34,430
And if that means i'm a hard-ass,
then that's the way it's gonna be.

583
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,930
You're just an ass.

584
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,640
Oh, that was angie. It wasn't me.

585
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,540
- She says she thinks-- - i don't care
what you think, angie.I really don't.

586
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,750
I just wanna protect my son
from ever ending up like you.

587
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,160
Well, you can seriously go...

588
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,190
What?

589
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,350
Well, looks like somebody's gonna
miss the party of the century.

590
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,480
Can't. Grounded.

591
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,550
You're gonna let that stop you?

592
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,740
Come on, man. Your mom's not even home.

593
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,120
Hey, angie?

594
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,240
Come on. Life's short.

595
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,460
Trust me on that.

596
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,840
Hey, is this music too loud for you?

597
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,150
Blondie?

598
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,780
Well, at least he's got good taste.

599
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,780
Yeah, i'm not so sure it's his.

600
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:18,460
Ned! Honey, i'm comin' in.

601
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,110
What kind of party is under a bridge?

602
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,740
I think it's the next block up.

603
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,380
You mean that place
with all the cop cars?

604
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,590
My god.

605
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,020
Excuse me. I am looking
for my son, ned banks.

606
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,120
Sorry, ma'am. You're gonna have
to come down to the precinct.

607
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,280
Are you arresting everyone?

608
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,110
Yes, ma'am. Drugs and alcohol.

609
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,950
Where the hell is he?

610
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,650
He went home. Wuss.

611
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,630
He went home.

612
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,350
What?

613
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,660
I brought trivia cards
just to help pass the time.

614
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,000
Trivia? With me?

615
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,640
Right. Bad idea. Sorry.

616
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,330
I hope i did the right thing here.

617
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,800
The important thing is you tried.

618
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,950
Well, with your help. Thank you.

619
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,660
You do that, you know, not just with me.

620
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,740
Yeah, random acts of kindness.

621
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,430
Right.

622
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:01,310
I gotta say you're kind of amazing.

623
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,630
I mean, you're a little strange, too.

624
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:10,020
So are you. Amazing.

625
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,920
Amazing.
Not--not strange.

626
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,050
Would it be wrong of me to want to...

627
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,820
Run into a little traffic here?

628
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,630
Why would you want that?

629
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,320
Make the trip last a little bit longer.

630
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,140
Do you have any idea how
much trouble you're in?

631
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,100
No, but i'm sure you're
gonna tell me all about it.

632
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,290
- Ok, let's all try to-- -
first of all, you're grounded.

633
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,240
Second of all, you're grounded.

634
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,090
Was it really worth it just
risking your life for some party?

635
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,490
That's a little
dramatic, don't you think?

636
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,750
I didn't really risk my life.

637
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,030
Guys, if you'll
just let me--

638
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,710
when we got there, the police were
arresting almost all of those kids,

639
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,160
and 2 of them were taken
away in an ambulance.

640
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,410
I left before they got there.

641
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,220
You weren't supposed to
be there inhe first place.

642
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,550
Yeah, at least he's still alive, and i
would be, too, if it weren't for my parents.

643
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,150
- I told you,
ne-- - wait.

644
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,590
Angie's here.

645
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,850
You know what? I have had it with her.

646
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,880
Actually, i think you
may wanna hear this.

647
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,250
Angie, what did you mean about
being dead because of your parents?

648
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,780
I wasn't walking back home
the night i was killed.

649
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:27,450
I was walking back to the
party to be with my friends.

650
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,090
It's the only place i felt safe.

651
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,850
You were walking back to the party.

652
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:37,570
Yes, because by the time i'd
gotten home, i was 5 minutes late,

653
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,760
5 stinking minutes late, and my
dad locked me out of the house.

654
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,920
So i started walking back to the
party, and i was crying so hard...

655
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,170
I didn't even hear that car.

656
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,440
What is it? What's going on?

657
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,350
She says her parents locked
her out of the house that night,

658
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,330
Because she missed her
curfew by 5 minutes.

659
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,980
They were that strict.

660
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,970
That's hoible.

661
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,700
I would never do that to ned.

662
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,680
She says you already have, locked
him out, because you're lying to him.

663
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:14,300
And she wants to know how's he ever gonna learn from
your mistakes if you're not being honest with him?

664
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,640
That's
not--

665
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,070
ok.You're right.

666
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:30,190
But you know, what happened to
you, i learned such a huge lesson.

667
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:35,270
What i mean is a lot of
this is because of you.

668
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,980
When jody called me that morning
to tell me that you were dead,

669
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:44,710
My whole life was completely changed.

670
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,380
And when i finally stopped crying,

671
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:54,500
I vowed that i would never let anything
like that happen to somebody i cared about.

672
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,450
So i guess...

673
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:06,120
I wouldn't be the mom i
am if i hadn't known you.

674
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,390
And i wouldn't have a son like ned.

675
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:16,080
If my parents talked to me like that...

676
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:19,420
It's never too late, even now.

677
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,450
You can talk to them.

678
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,200
That's genius, einstein.

679
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,450
I'm dead.

680
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,700
That's what i'm here for.

681
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,480
I already called them.

682
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:48,950
Just so you know, when i got to
that party, i saw how crazy it was,

683
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,370
so i turned around and came home.

684
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,950
I'm proud of you, ned.

685
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,720
I'm not sure that's what i would
have done when i was your age.

686
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,500
And i'm sorry for the way i acted.

687
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:06,390
Good. Me, too.

688
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,220
The truth is i'm always
gonna worry about you.

689
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,640
And the drugs and the drinking,
i know they're all around,

690
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,320
And its not that i don't
trust your judgment.

691
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,460
It's just what happens to your judgment
the second you're drunk or getting high.

692
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:22,730
Mom, i know.

693
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,110
I'm sorry you lost your friend.

694
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,650
Me, too.

695
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,580
Thank you.

696
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,550
I guess thers nothin' like a road
trip to help you forget your past.

697
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,230
I mean my past, not your
past. I'm sure yours is fine.

698
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,200
No, i need to move forward, too.

699
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,170
That's good to hear.

700
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,670
Hey, uh, look, i know we just got here.

701
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,610
But, um, you wanna go down
to the village? I don't know.

702
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,500
We could go to a restaurant or, um...

703
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,220
Hit a bookstore. The only bookstore.

704
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:24,450
Uh, or we could just, you know, get a movie
and then have takeout, come back here, and...

705
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,650
We could, uh...

706
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,550
Go to a hardware store a-and
t some spackle and then...

707
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,730
Spackle?

708
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,150
You know, i think i've forgotten how
to do this along with everything else.

709
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,970
Do what?

710
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,710
Ask somebody out.

711
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,870
- Is that what you're doing?
- Yeah.

712
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,320
Sam!

713
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,480
I got your message, and--and
then i spoke to cheryl.

714
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,890
I'm so sorry.

715
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,380
Oh, my god. It's true. You
don't know who i am, do you?

716
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,400
I'm sorry.

717
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,690
You must be nicole.

718
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,870
Nikki. It's nikki.
