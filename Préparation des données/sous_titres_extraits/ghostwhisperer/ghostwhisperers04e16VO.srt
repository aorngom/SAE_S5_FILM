19

Where were you?

20
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,300
At the--The firehouse.

21
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,200
Oh, right. You told me that. I forgot.

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,700
Later.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,900
oh!

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,000
If that's sam, could you just tell him
That i'm at the restaurant already?

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,800
'Cause I don't want him
to cancel on me again.

26
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,700
it's a telemarketer.

27
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,400
What is going on?

28
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,100
Well, it's just,
he's been acting weird lately,

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,800
You know, like something's changed.

30
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,800
Like what?

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,800
I don't know.

32
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,100
It's like he can't trust me,
which, Who can blame him?

33
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,800
I'm always running around after ghosts
Or hushed conversations with eli.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,200
But you do know.

35
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,000
It's all about ghosts.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,300
Melinda, you have to tell him about it.

37
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,900
I mean, at best he'll believe you,

38
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,400
At worst, he'll think you're...

39
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,800
eccentric. Like I did.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,900
What?

41
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,600
Nothing.

42
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,500
It's just, I was gonna tell him
at dinner tonight,

43
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,200
But a part of me was hoping
That you would really talk me out of it.

44
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,500
Why? You tell people
you see ghosts all the time.

45
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,600
Yes, but it's not
usually followed up with,

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,700
"Oh, by the way,

47
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
"You're my husband's soul
in another man's body.

48
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,700
Could you--Could you
pass the salt?"

49
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,900
Are you planning on
telling him everything?

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,300
First i'm going to see
how he deals with my gift, you know?

51
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,600
Baby steps.

52
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,000
good night.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,100
you didn't eat much.

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,700
yeah, I guess i wasn't hungry.

55
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,600
Well, i'm glad that
you got some free time.

56
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,100
Yeah, schedule's been crazy.

57
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,100
Look, I wanted to
spend time together, but...

58
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,200
Never mind.

59
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,000
Look...

60
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,800
I think I know what's going on,

61
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,500
And I just want to clear the air,
Because I hate having secrets.

62
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,700
Good. That would be great.

63
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,800
What's wrong? It's like
you've seen a ghost.

64
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Actually...

65
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,300
what the hell?

66
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,600
all right, so
we got everything, right?

67
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,200
So, um, how long do we
have to stay at this hotel?

68
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,700
Oh, probably just the night.

69
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,300
If the events are as
frequent as you say they are,

70
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,800
I should know something by dawn.

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,100
John, devin, what's going on?

72
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,400
Oh, hey, melinda.
We were just, um...

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,900
Some weird stuff has been going on.

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Uh, noises, things moving.

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,200
Then doors started opening--
Locked doors.

76
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,100
Yeah, we're at the end of our rope.

77
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,400
Yeah, see, I know you probably
think This sounds crazy,

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,700
And that's no offense to you,

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But when the plumber and
the electrician couldn't help us,

80
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,000
We didn't know who
else to call, but--

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,200
Linus van horn,

82
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,500
Spi--Supernatural,
paranormal investigation.

83
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,300
Oh, here's my card.

84
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,100
What do you do, exactly?

85
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,400
Uh, well, spectral beings emit energy,

86
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,200
So I set up infrared
still and video cameras,

87
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,300
Ultra sensitive audio recorders,
Thermal measuring...

88
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,100
There are a lot of
non-Believers out there.

89
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm guessing you're among them?

90
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,900
no, no, no. It's just...

91
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,800
- Really?
- Absolutely.

92
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,700
So if you ever need
a ghost hunter--

93
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,300
no, that's all right.
I'm already In hock to my, uh,

94
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,400
witch doctor, but thanks.

95
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,500
Witch doctors.

96
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,500
Ghost hunters?
Are people really this stupid?

97
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,500
The clients, or the ghost guy?

98
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
What's the difference?
I mean, this is nonsense. Ghosts?

99
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,000
Look, what you were saying
about clearing things up--

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,400
You know what,
i, um, i--Ugh,

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,400
I forgot to write a check
to the website guys.

102
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,800
I'm just gonna run back to the store.

103
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,000
I can go with you. That's ok.

104
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,600
'Cause i'm probably just
gonna do some other things

105
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,700
While i'm there, so i'll just--
I'll see you later.

106
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,000
Right.

107
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,300
I was this close!
You know, to coming clean.

108
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,700
And then this guy had to show up.

109
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,700
You know, how is sam
supposed to take me seriously

110
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,600
When there's a hearse
driving around town

111
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,800
With a big, giant ghost on top?

112
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,900
Well, what if there really
is a ghost in your friend's abode?

113
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,000
Well, then it needs
to be handled respectfully

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,200
And crossed over, you know?

115
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,600
Not tormented and photographed

116
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,900
by some guy Who has no idea
what he's dealing with.

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,600
Wait a minute. So these guys
Actually really can detect ghosts?

118
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,700
Yeah, some of them, but
that's all, you know?

119
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,100
They can capture recordings and sounds,
But they can't communicate with spirits.

120
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,700
So people end up spending All of this money

121
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,500
just to confuse and anger ghosts,
and make things worse.

122
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,300
All right, our ability should
be on a need to know basis.

123
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,500
Otherwise, we run the risk of
becoming a complete laughingstock.

124
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,500
Trust me.

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,200
Sounds like you speak from experience.

126
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,200
yeah. I was almost outed
by that shame the devil website.

127
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,700
So you come to me to do what, rant?

128
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,700
No, for help.

129
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,700
Oh, boy.

130
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,600
Please?

131
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,500
Ok, will you just go over there
And find out if there's a ghost,

132
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,700
and cross him over?

133
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,000
All right? And tell that guy To take
his carnival act somewhere else,

134
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Because I really...

135
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,500
I really need to tell sam the truth
With just a little shred of dignity.

136
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,800
if you want to learn about ghosts,
You need the right equipment.

137
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,800
That's a k-2 meter.
That measures magnetic fields.

138
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,600
Theoretically, if used properly,

139
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,800
You should be able to get
ghosts to communicate with you,

140
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,200
You know, like 2 blips for yes,
One for no sort of thing.

141
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,400
Sounds primitive.

142
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,400
Have you communicated with any ghosts?

143
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,900
Uh, well, no, not yet.

144
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,400
But I have heard them, Through evp.

145
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,900
Electronic, um--

146
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,200
Voice phenomena, yeah.
And i've seen them, too.

147
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Well, the recorded images.
Here, check these out.

148
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,600
Huh?

149
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,900
Look at that.

150
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,800
I used to use a t.I.D.C.

151
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,700
That's a thermal imaging digital camera.

152
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,200
Detects, you know, long wavelength Infrared,

153
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,100
you know, things are invisible
to the human eye.

154
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,200
But then I upgraded to the m.F.S.C.

155
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,500
I'm not gonna touch that one.

156
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,600
That's a multi-Frequency
sensitive camera.

157
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,000
And ever since I got
this baby right here,

158
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,500
I've been detecting ghosts everywhere.

159
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,100
They look like little specks of dust.

160
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,200
Uh, yeah, But they were
taken in total darkness

161
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,900
Where there's no light to detect dust.

162
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,200
I thought you said you were a believer.

163
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,100
Oh, I do believe--
With the skepticism of science.

164
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,500
Wow, that's a really hot ghost.

165
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,400
What?

166
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,500
Oh, no. I'm sorry. That's, uh,

167
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,900
that's my ex-Girlfriend.

168
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,500
And you got all this using your multi...

169
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,900
Frequency sensitive
camera, that's right.

170
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,100
This baby right here.
And not cheap.

171
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
What do we do now?

172
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,300
We turn off the lights and we wait.

173
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,900
no, no, hey!

174
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,800
Wait, shh, shh! Hey, hey, hey!

175
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,900
look at this, come here!

176
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,600
Oh!

177
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,800
There is definitely a presence.

178
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah, you can call it that.

179
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,400
This is so weird. Usually
when I pick up an e.V.P.,

180
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,100
Something comes up--

181
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
Stairs! Go towards the stairs!

182
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,000
What?

183
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, there it is!

184
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,700
Wait, is that-- Is that--

185
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,200
It's that, really. Come on, come on.

186
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,700
I just saw my first ghost.

187
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,700
Yeah.

188
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,600
How did you know where it was?

189
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,000
can you see us?

190
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:52,400
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com presents</font>

191
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000

Sync:FRS@wdysai</font>

192
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,400
GHOST WHISPERER S04E16

193
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,500
Are you listening?
I said I saw my first ghost!

194
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,400
Wait, so this ghost guy
is the real deal?

195
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,900
Only in that he can take pictures.
Nothing else is new.

196
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,400
Oh, really, miss I see
ghosts all the time?

197
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,800
Can us newbies bask a little? Please.

198
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,800
Ok, enough basking.
Did you talk to the ghost?

199
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,200
No.

200
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,800
But I kind of let it slip
that I could hear them,

201
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,800
So linus is extending his run.

202
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,200
Ugh, eli, you validated this guy?

203
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,100
No!

204
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,600
I merely heard
the ghost he photographed,

205
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,000
Which means he's legit.

206
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,800
Besides, won't this help you
prove to sam that ghosts are real?

207
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,500
Yeah, well, fuzzy orbs
wouldn't have swayed me.

208
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,800
Thank you. You know, eli,
You have to cross this ghost.

209
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,800
And get rid of this guy.

210
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,000
Just give me a little bit more time.

211
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
I don't have much more time.

212
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,900
I know. But when I tried to engage
her in a little one-On-One,

213
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,000
She realized she was
being videoed, she bounced.

214
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
Great, so she's hiding something.

215
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,900
It'd be so much easier
if you just came over there and just--

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
I can't, ok?

217
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,300
If I start hanging out at a house
with a plastic ghost in front,

218
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,600
Sam's gonna think i'm nuts.

219
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,200
Ok, look, i did my research.

220
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,900
Your friends bought
that house in a probate sale

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
From the estate of one evelyn bellsbury,

222
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,900
Senior citizen who lived there from 1972
Until she vanished a few years ago.

223
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,900
The case was never solved.

224
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,100
Well, then, solve it for god sake, ok?

225
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,000
Just find out what's keeping
this mrs. Bellsbury here.

226
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,100
Get her into the light
so melinda can tell sam!

227
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,900
I really, I just can't
take much more of this!

228
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,000
Ok! I'm on it.

229
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
Ok, hmm...

230
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,200
Melinda Gordon + Grandview

231
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,600
Come on.

232
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,300
Let's see who you are.

233
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,100
???

234
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,100
"Grandview antiques
dealer melinda gordon

235
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,700
Seems to be hiding a
very mysterious sideline."

236
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,900
???

237
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,600
Damn it.

238
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,000
trouble, no!

239
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,900
No! Hey, sorry,
but can't you read the sign?

240
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,800
uh, i'm actually Not selling anything.

241
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,800
Um, i'm--You're
jeffrey crockett, right?

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm dr. Eli james.

243
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,100
Um, i'm writing a paper
On the plight of grandview's elderly,

244
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,100
And, uh, I was wondering
if you knew anything

245
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,200
About your neighbor, evelyn bellsbury.

246
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,300
Uh, a little.

247
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,300
We bought the house 10 years ago,
Right before she disappeared.

248
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,600
I was hoping to learn a
little bit more about that.

249
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,900
Well, yeah. She was, uh,
a really sweet old lady.

250
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,900
We called her mrs. Blueberry

251
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,900
Because she made
the most amazing jellies and jams.

252
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,000
Trouble! No!

253
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,200
I didn't realize she was married.

254
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,200
Well, she wasn't.

255
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,800
It was just her And her parakeet
as far as I know.

256
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,000
Anyway, we were shocked
when she went missing.

257
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,800
Do you remember anything about that?

258
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,400
Let's see, um,

259
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,700
she brought over these scrumptious
Blueberry tarts for the holidays.

260
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,200
I mean, the filling was unbelievable.

261
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,100
The pastry was like butter. It--

262
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,400
Trouble!

263
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,600
And then a couple weeks later,

264
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,800
There were cop cars out
in front of her house.

265
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,500
So she just left?

266
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,400
Well, nobody really knows.
I mean, her car was there,

267
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,100
Her keys were in her purse in her house
With her license and her passport.

268
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,700
There was still a bunch of
blueberry tarts on the windowsill.

269
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,000
Any chance that she could
have just wandered off?

270
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,400
I don't know how far
she would have gotten.

271
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,900
She walked with a cane.

272
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,600
Listen, I gotta
let the dog out, you gotta go.

273
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,600
Give me a 5 second head start, ok?

274
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,600
hey.

275
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,600
Sam, hey.

276
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,500
Um, i'm sorry, but melinda
Just stepped out for a while.

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,200
Um, do you have any idea
Where she might be?

278
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,600
Um, actually I don't, but
you're welcome to stay,

279
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,500
Or I can just tell her
that you stopped by.

280
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,500
Oh, ok, yeah.

281
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,800
She's pretty guarded,
isn't she? Melinda?

282
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,600
You know, where she goes all the time.

283
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,300
What she's doing.

284
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,100
Yeah, she's, um,

285
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,900
Kind of a private person.

286
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,700
Look, I don't want to seem
like i'm checking up on her, ok,

287
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,600
But I just can't shake the feeling

288
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,900
That there is more going
on in her life than...

289
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,700
Selling antiques.

290
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,500
She's, um...

291
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,700
Complicated.

292
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,400
I know. I get it, I do.
And that's cool.

293
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,900
Just lost her husband, and maybe
i'm asking for too much, too soon.

294
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,600
But if there is something
going on with her,

295
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,400
I just want her to
know she can let me in.

296
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
She will.

297
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,100
I know she will.

298
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,900
I hope so.

299
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Sam,

300
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,700
melinda has got this huge heart.

301
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,600
And she's such a good person,
And she helps a lot of people,

302
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,100
And she just doesn't like to be

303
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,500
in the limelight or take credit.

304
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Credit for what?

305
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,400
You just gotta give her some time.

306
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,300
Yeah.

307
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,700
And when she does talk to you,

308
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
You gotta keep an open mind, ok?

309
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,800
Like, wide open.

310
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,700
Here you go.

311
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,400
Coffee, and in honor of our ghost,

312
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,900
Blueberry pastries.
'Cause I did a little research,

313
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,700
And our ghost--

314
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,700
Is most likely evelyn bellsbury,

315
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,800
Who the neighbors
affectionately refer to as

316
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,300
mrs. Blueberry.

317
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,700
So you met trouble.

318
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,600
Yes, I met trouble, and
I brought him dog biscuits, too.

319
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,300
I really do my homework.

320
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,500
You know, if mrs. Bellsbury
Tells us what happened to her,

321
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,000
She could be--
She could be the one.

322
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,000
The one?

323
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,700
Yeah, I mean, people may think
That folks like you and I are crazy,

324
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,000
But if we can actually prove

325
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,300
that a ghost helped us solve
A missing person's case...

326
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
oh, she's here!

327
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,500
Hit the lights.

328
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,700
Come here.

329
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,900
Holy cow.

330
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,200
Talk to her.

331
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,200
Talk to her!

332
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
Evelyn?

333
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,100
Can you tell me what happened to you?

334
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,300
Whoa, she's on the move. Here.

335
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,600
Put these on.

336
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,200
She's moving
kind of slow because--

337
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,500
She walked with a cane.

338
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,700
Yeah.

339
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh, look!

340
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,300
There it is.

341
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,800
Oh, my god.

342
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,800
It really is her.

343
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,600
This is awesome!

344
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,900
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

345
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,700
That's the door the occupant
said kept opening.

346
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,000
Even when it was locked.

347
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,800
I got goosebumps.
Do you have goosebumps?

348
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,700
Mrs. Bellsbury?!

349
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,900
She's gone.

350
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry. My bad.

351
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,300
Cake mix?

352
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Cake mix?

353
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,300
It's empty.

354
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,500
Hey, look, there's
a false bottom to this.

355
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,200
13 cents.

356
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
It's an old savings passbook.

357
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,400
Look at this--
Right before she disappeared,

358
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,900
She withdrew everything she had in cash.

359
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Do you think she hoarded
all of her money In these cake boxes?

360
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,100
Yes, I do.

361
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,700
But where's the money now?

362
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,900
Little old lady, living alone.

363
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,700
Withdraws all of her
savings, and then--

364
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,600
Wait, wait, you think somebody knew
That all of her money was here?

365
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,500
Could have been anyone.

366
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,500
Housekeeper or someone
Who followed her home from the bank.

367
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,300
- 'Cause the next thing--
- She disappears.

368
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,900
She leaves a fresh batch
Of blueberry tarts

369
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,000
just sitting on the
windowsill, Cooling.

370
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,600
What a waste.

371
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,100
???

372
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,600
murder!

373
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,700
We're talking murder!

374
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,800
Poor little mrmrs. Blueberry,
She put all her money into dry goods,

375
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,600
And they whacked her!

376
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,200
All right, keep your voice down!

377
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,500
God, what are you, in the mob?

378
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,800
Wait until you see the footage.

379
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,000
did he upload this
to his website already?

380
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,600
yeah, guy's gotta make a living.

381
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,000
And if linus cracks a murder,

382
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,900
He's on his way to
some serious ghost coin.

383
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,600
I thought you said
this was a passion for him.

384
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,800
It is! And after seeing my first spirit,

385
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,900
I'm thinking about
quitting my day job, too.

386
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,200
You were that inspired

387
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,400
By some shifting, grainy blob?

388
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,200
Don't call mrs. Blueberry a blob.

389
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,900
She's a nice, murdered little old lady.

390
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,900
How do you know?

391
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,400
She baked treats.

392
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,200
How do you know that she was murdered?

393
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,000
Ok, so, fine, she led
you to some stored money--

394
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,300
Uh, all of her money,

395
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Withdrawn days before she disappeared.

396
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,500
One day it's gone, and so is she.

397
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,900
What?

398
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,300
What, you think she went to paris
and left her tarts on the windowsill?

399
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
I don't know.
The woman was 76 years old.

400
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,900
Maybe she forgot about them.

401
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,200
oh! I forgot about them!

402
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,600
Why can't this be murder?!

403
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,100
Are you jealous because
i'm playing with linus and not you?

404
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,600
look, if she
was killed by somebody,

405
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,900
Why wouldn't she
just tell you that?

406
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,500
- Sam!
- Hey.

407
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,800
Eli!

408
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,800
Melinda.

409
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,100
Eli.

410
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,100
Sam.

411
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,900
Yeah, I just, uh,
i thought i'd come by.

412
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,300
I saw you were home, and...

413
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,000
What is that?

414
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,400
Uh, that's--

415
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,800
That's the guy.

416
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,500
That's the ghost guy, right?

417
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,200
Yeah, uh, eli was just showing it to me.

418
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,300
Yeah, uh, I was talking to him.

419
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
I like people who are
different and stuff.

420
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,400
Wait a minute, what's that?

421
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,800
Supposed to be some kind of ghost?

422
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,600
I think so, yeah.

423
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,400
Yeah. How did he do that?

424
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,700
What makes you think he did anything?

425
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,500
What, you guys don't believe
in this stuff, do you?

426
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,100
Well, I mean, he recorded sounds
And some energy moving around.

427
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,500
Yeah, well, it's easy enough
to doctor footage, isn't it?

428
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,600
Well, yeah, I guess so, but the
neighbors did say that they heard voices,

429
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,200
You know, when nobody else was home.

430
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,300
Right, hearing noises,
like bumps in the night.

431
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,100
It's basically air and plumbing.

432
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,200
And energy moving around,

433
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
isn't that just when We forget
where we put our keys?

434
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,700
Well, what makes you so sure?

435
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,400
You know, I barely
know who I am right now,

436
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,600
So i'm not sure about much,

437
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,600
but the one thing I am sure of
Is that ghosts aren't real,

438
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,300
And i'm very sure that guys
like this who say they are

439
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,600
Are just preying on
other people's fears.

440
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,900
what's up with
jim's negativ-O attitude

441
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,800
About all things paranormal?

442
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,500
You'd think a ghost ate
his dog or something.

443
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,900
Yeah, it's weird. I mean,

444
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,800
jim was never like that, not at all.

445
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,100
When you told him,
he just jumped right in a believer?

446
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,400
All I know is, he--

447
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,800
He believed in me,

448
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,000
And somehow it's harder
for him to do that.

449
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,900
oh, wait, ok! Listen,
I really get the sense--

450
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,400
And this knucklehead,
He's not making it any easier.

451
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,200
what can you do?

452
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,800
Nothing! It's probably fine.

453
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,700
Look, you said a woman was murdered
in our house and she's still there.

454
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,800
How is that fine?

455
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,400
it's, uh--Oh, hi.

456
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,800
Hey, I was just coming by
to see how everything's going.

457
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,700
Honestly? Terrible.

458
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,400
Guess what? We bought a haunted house.

459
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,300
- Honey, i--
- You saw the proof!

460
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,600
You guys are talking about
the previous owner, right?

461
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,300
Mrs. Bellsbury? Did you ever meet her?

462
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,400
No. Did you?

463
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,500
No.

464
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,400
Did you actually--
Did you actually see her?

465
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,200
I mean, how did she
make her presence known?

466
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,100
Well, we started hearing clanging
And banging in the night.

467
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,700
And the jars would
rattle in the basement.

468
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,600
The jars?

469
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,700
You know, the sealed glass jars
People buy for canning.

470
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,300
She left hundreds of them.

471
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,300
Uh, look, we, uh, we have
to re-Register at the hotel

472
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,600
If we're going to stay another night.

473
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,700
It's good seeing you, melinda.

474
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,500
- ??
- And you,

475
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,900
you call us
if there's any resolution.

476
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,000
And I truly believe that spirits
Do not mean us any harm,

477
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,800
you know, They just want to be
heard and understood!

478
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,100
You didn't tell me about jars.

479
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,100
I didn't know about them, i still don't.

480
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,100
Ok, well, you said that she was
hiding her money in the pantry.

481
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,000
Then it's gone, what else is missing?

482
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,500
Um, her body?

483
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,700
The fruits of her labor.

484
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,300
Ok. All right, she was stocking up.

485
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,500
What year did she go missing, exactly?

486
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,400
Uh, I guess it was 1999.

487
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,400
So the last time that
the neighbors saw her,

488
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,600
It was christmas.

489
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,400
But what if--What if she
wasn't saving up for christmas?

490
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,200
What if it was for new year's?

491
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,700
Mrs. Bellsbury?

492
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,400
If it is you,

493
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,000
Can you please tell me
what happened--

494
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,100
Oh, no. No.

495
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,300
No, no, no. Hey, wait, wait, come back!

496
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,000
She's here!

497
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,800
Um, she's, um, she's here! She's here!

498
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,000
He's a psycho. Let's go.

499
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,300
what is that?
Do you hear that?

500
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,000
I don't hear ghosts. You do.

501
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,600
Oh, right.

502
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,400
Oh.

503
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,600
Come here,

504
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,500
Why is she making that noise?

505
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,800
No!

506
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,500
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

507
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,700
Wait a minute. What happened?

508
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,700
are you seeing this?!

509
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,600
It's mrs. Bellsbury!

510
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,000
I know that dress.
I saw it in a photo. Holy cow!

511
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,200
Hello, are you seeing this?!

512
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,300
I see it!

513
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,400
I saw it.

514
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,400
And?

515
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,700
Right body, wrong ghost.

516
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,000
The pressure latch jammed.
She got locked in.

517
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
Wasn't a robbery, either.

518
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,300
The police said they found
Her life savings down there.

519
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,800
Minus the 13 cents
we found in that cake box.

520
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,500
So much for robbery murder.

521
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,400
Yeah. I'm glad about that.

522
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,600
Look, i'm gonna try
and grab some more gear,

523
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
See if I can get in there.

524
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,500
The police might need my help, you know?

525
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,400
There's still a story to be told here.

526
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,300
And thanks to this puppy,
i'm the man to tell it.

527
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,800
I think mrs. Bellsbury's been
at peace For a long, long time now.

528
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,500
Are you sure you didn't see her spirit?

529
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,900
Not unless she was trans-Gendered
Or cut twenty years off her age.

530
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,300
What was she doing down there?

531
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,800
I think she was preparing
for the millennium.

532
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,500
I mean, the jars, the preserves,

533
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,600
The money that she was
hiding in her secret room.

534
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,300
A panic room.

535
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,500
She was making a panic room
because 1999 Was coming to a close.

536
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,200
Yeah, the whole world was freaking out.

537
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,600
You know, january first, 2000.

538
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,600
The computers were supposed to fail;
Banking systems collapse.

539
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,400
Life as we know it would cease.

540
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,500
She was a y2k nut.

541
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
But who's the ghost that led us to her?

542
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,200
I have no idea.

543
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,500
Neither does linus.

544
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,700
And mrs. Blueberry sure ain't talking.

545
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,600
Wait a minute.

546
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,400
Linus.

547
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,100
What if we're right?

548
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,200
What if the ghost isn't someone
in her life Or the new owners?

549
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,500
Who else does that leave?

550
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,600
Linus?

551
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,700
But I only said that
'cause you said it already.

552
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,300
Ever since he got his fancy equipment,

553
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,900
His very accurate fancy equipment,

554
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,000
He's been able to see ghosts everywhere.

555
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,200
I haven't seen ghosts everywhere.
Have you heard any?

556
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,800
I just assumed he was exaggerating.

557
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,900
What if he wasn't?

558
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,900
What if the reason he's
the only one who's finding ghosts

559
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,000
Is because he's the one who's haunted?

560
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,700
Anyway, as you can see,
there's a lot of activity here.

561
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,300
it's unbelievable!

562
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,100
I've gotten 3 calls
from reporters, 2 new clients,

563
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,500
and my website Is
getting slammed with hits.

564
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Congrats.

565
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,800
You're the one that figured out
That mrs. B was canning for catastrophe.

566
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,200
You should be sharing
some of the credit.

567
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,100
I appreciate that, but I prefer
To keep what I do private.

568
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Why? It's so cool.

569
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,300
Eli, you could change
the way that people think

570
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,300
About the dead, about the unknown,
About everything.

571
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,400
Yeah, well, it might change
the way people think about me.

572
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
you can't--

573
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,500
You can't be worried about that.

574
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,900
I--I--Yes, I know,

575
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,200
I paid the price for believing,

576
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,300
But it doesn't matter,
'cause it's important to me.

577
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,400
Why?

578
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,000
I mean, one day i heard ghosts,
I needed an explanation.

579
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,600
But you, you took a leap of
faith long before you had proof.

580
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,200
Oh, I had proof.

581
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,700
Believe me.

582
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,700
I grew up in a bad part of the city.

583
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,300
And when we were 9,

584
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,600
My friend, he got shot.

585
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Just crossing the street.

586
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,100
It was pretty hard to feel safe
after that, But...

587
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,700
i did.

588
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,000
Why?

589
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,500
My grandmother told me
that he was with me.

590
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,400
Your friend who died?

591
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,200
Did your grandmother have the gift?

592
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,500
well, she can't see
or hear ghosts,

593
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,900
But she believes in guardian angels.

594
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,100
And she said that
I have one with me now.

595
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
And she must have been right,

596
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,500
Because how else would I
have gotten out of there?

597
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Gone to college, graduate school.

598
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,100
All along the way, being guided
to people who would help me.

599
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Well, like carrie.

600
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,500
Carrie? Who's carrie?
Is that someone who died?

601
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,700
No. No, no, no. It's my ex-Girlfriend.

602
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,000
You saw her picture.

603
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,500
Yeah. Even after she broke up with me,

604
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,200
She loaned me the money to buy that
multi-Frequency sensitive camera.

605
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,600
I mean, is that nice or what?

606
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,300
Um, mixed.

607
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,300
But i'm interested in
this guardian angel.

608
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,200
Is he still with you?

609
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,500
Sure, yeah, I guess.

610
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,700
Do you think it's someone other than
your friend Who died as a child?

611
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,900
Say a man, mid-Fifties,
you may have known?

612
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,800
That's pretty specific, eli.

613
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,500
Do you know anyone who died
who matches that description?

614
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,900
No, no, not a soul.

615
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Why? Do you hear somebody around me?

616
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,200
Because i'm pretty sure that carrie
would have captured something like that.

617
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,400
Carrie, your girlfriend?

618
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,000
No, no, no, no. I named
my mfs camera in her honor.

619
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,000
Ok.

620
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,600
When you said carrie
picks up ghost images,

621
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,200
Basically everywhere you
go since you got it--

622
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,300
Her, There's a spirit around you.

623
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,700
Spirits are everywhere.

624
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,200
I mean, I just didn't see them
until I got carrie.

625
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,900
When was that, exactly?

626
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,100
He doesn't know anyone
who fits that description?

627
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,500
He didn't seem to, but I do know
when he started clocking spirit stuff.

628
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,400
Spirits, or this particular spirit?

629
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,600
That's for you to figure out.
I got papers to grade.

630
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
But it all started when his
girlfriend carrie gave him the boot

631
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,400
And a nice loan for his
fancy camera-- A rather large loan.

632
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,500
Eli, i'm not a jealous guy.

633
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,000
I mean, she and i haven't
been dating long enough

634
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,900
For me to even be jealous.

635
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,700
But, look, i have to say,

636
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,000
I do notice you coming in and out
of melinda's At all hours, I do.

637
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,100
We're friends.

638
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,900
I know that, And that's not
what i'm after here.

639
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,500
I don't think for a minute
that you guys are involved.

640
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,500
Not for a minute?

641
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,300
I mean, we're not, but...

642
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,000
a minute?

643
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,000
Eli...

644
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,300
I'm here about the bodies.

645
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Excuse me?

646
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
The dead people that tend to surface

647
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,900
Every time melinda becomes
interested in something.

648
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,500
There was--There was the little girl
At the bottom of the well

649
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,000
She was suddenly fascinated by.

650
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,300
There was the sorority
girl lost in the woods.

651
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
She wasn't dead.

652
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Nearly dead. And then there's
the old lady that they just found.

653
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,800
Look, eli, tell me, i know
you worked on this case.

654
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,200
Case? What are you talking about?
I'm a professor.

655
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,900
Yeah, but you're also
a clinical psychologist

656
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,300
Who consults with the police.

657
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,400
What makes you think that?

658
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,900
Because you told me
one night, over drinks.

659
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,300
I gotta quit drinking.

660
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,300
You had one beer.

661
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,600
That's pathetic.
I gotta quit bragging.

662
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,200
Look, I talked to delia
and she said, look,

663
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,000
Cut melinda some slack, ok,

664
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,900
because she does so much
For the community, You know.

665
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,900
She helps people.

666
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,100
Now you tell me, how does
an antiques dealer do that?

667
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,000
Well, you can do stuff.

668
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,900
Ah, you can't tell me.
All right, i'll say it--

669
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,800
She's a profiler, isn't she?

670
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,600
Well, if she was,
and i'm not saying she is,

671
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,700
Don't you think it should
be her place to tell you?

672
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,200
She lies to me.

673
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,700
And I just want to know why.

674
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,500
And if she's not working with the law,
Then what the hell is she doing?

675
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,400
Please.

676
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,300
Ok, look.

677
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Her official title is criminologist, ok?

678
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,000
But she operates completely
and totally under the radar.

679
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,800
The fed insist on that.

680
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,400
Yeah.

681
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,700
So linus sent you to me for a reference?

682
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,500
Well, how did you know you were haunted?

683
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,300
I've, um...

684
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,900
i've sensed things around me,

685
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,900
I'm guessing that you
believe in what linus does.

686
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,000
What's important is that he believes.

687
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,200
He's not in it for the money.

688
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,100
When I was with him, 

689
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,300
I had to push him to
even bill for his time.

690
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
Do you--

691
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,600
Do you feed the birds
like that every night?

692
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,500
no.

693
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,500
It's a baby raccoon.

694
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,800
I think its mother abandoned it.

695
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,700
Oh.

696
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,800
I guess i'm just
the patron saint of lost causes--

697
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,200
Like linus.

698
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,900
I'm guessing that
he wasn't having much luck

699
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,800
When you with him.
Finding ghosts, I mean.

700
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,900
No.

701
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,600
Not too many.

702
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
But did you see him
on the news last night?

703
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,000
He found this woman
who had been missing for years.

704
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,700
If only some people could see him now.

705
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,500
Who are we talking about?

706
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,500
My father.

707
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,600
He, uh, he died.

708
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,800
I'm sorry.

709
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,600
He was always so hard on linus.

710
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,800
You know, he thought he was

711
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,100
Such a loser and a kook,

712
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,100
A pile of wasted potential.

713
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,400
Not someone to build a future with.

714
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,000
And when the rent checks kept bouncing

715
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And a fun date

716
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,200
Meant going to the impound
to get the boot off our car...

717
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,300
I caved.

718
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,600
And I dumped him.

719
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But you missed him.

720
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,900
A lot.

721
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,600
Enough to buy some
new equipment for him?

722
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,200
Well, after my father died,
i didn't see the harm.

723
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,600
Do you--Do you have
a picture of him?

724
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,100
Your father?

725
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,700
Yeah, why?

726
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,400
I think I can tell you in a minute.

727
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,300
If I could just see a picture.

728
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,200
Ok, I have some on my phone.

729
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,300
He would roll over in his grave
If he knew what I did with his money.

730
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,900
Yeah, I think he's done
much more than that.

731
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,700
???

732
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,700
Well, I guess the linus
show is extended once again.

733
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,800
But what people don't realize

734
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,300
is the ghost h he's looking for
Is his ex-Girlfriend's father.

735
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,500
What is wrong with you?

736
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,600
You'd think as a shrink
i'd know what to do with my anger,

737
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,500
But look at me, my body is vibrating.

738
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,700
You're really that mad?
I mean, he's a ghost.

739
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,800
They lie to us all the time.

740
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,200
No, this is different.

741
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,100
Linus can't detect ghosts like us,

742
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,800
Ok, but that never shook his faith.

743
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,300
He doesn't deserve to be
deliberately mocked this way.

744
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,200
Wow, you really care about him.

745
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,300
Yeah, I do. He's kind of like my protÉG?.

746
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,500
He kinda looks up to me.

747
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,100
Aw, that's cute.

748
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,900
It's not cute, it's serious.

749
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,500
I hope this ghost creep
stays earth-Bound forever.

750
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,600
I'm just glad the old man
screwed up so bad

751
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,700
He made linus look like
an actual genius.

752
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,500
You just said that the ghost actually
Made linus look like a genius.

753
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,500
Yeah, his plan backfired, precisely.

754
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,400
What if that was his plan?

755
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,900
Ok? What if--

756
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
What if that ghost is
actually trying to help him?

757
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,700
Oh, great.

758
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,400
So now all of a sudden,
the ghost is a good guy?

759
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,800
What would be wrong with that?

760
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,200
What am I supposed to
do with my anger now?

761
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,500
Walk it off.

762
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,600
All right? We have to go talk to linus.

763
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,300
Go.

764
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Walk.

765
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,500
With a full night to observe, maybe two,

766
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,000
I can confirm whether or not

767
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,300
your manifestations
Indicate a spectral infestation.

768
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,400
So this is for real?

769
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,800
Those machines can prove
we have actual ghosts?

770
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,200
Didn't you talk to devon and john?

771
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,800
Well, what happens after?
How do you get rid of them?

772
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,600
Uh, well, I mean,
there's a whole process.

773
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,500
Um, but detection is the first step
To elimination.

774
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,100
Could you excuse us for a minute?

775
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,300
Yeah, of course.

776
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,800
So I guess word of mouth
is good for business.

777
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,400
You know, it's like ever since
that mrs. Bellsbury thing,

778
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,300
It's like everybody who has
air in their plumbing Has a ghost.

779
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,300
It's not that i'm saying
that they don't.

780
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,100
It's just I feel kind of bad
taking advantage, you know?

781
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,500
So is that how john and devon found you?

782
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,100
Is you helped somebody they knew?

783
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,000
Actually, there's a funny story to that.

784
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,400
Both john and devon each said that

785
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,000
they found their browser
Open to my website.

786
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
And they thought that
the other one left it for them.

787
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,500
I've seen evidence of ghosts

788
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,600
interacting with electronics before, But..

789
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,300
it's almost like mrs. Bellsbury
Wanted me to find her, you know?

790
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,000
Yeah, it's a lot like that.

791
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Ok.

792
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,900
Ok, you may be right.

793
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,400
The ghost may not be evil.

794
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,100
Yeah, which means he's been
leading you this whole time--

795
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,600
To the money stash,
the basement room, Everything.

796
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,800
But we did some pretty good
detective work. I mean...

797
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,300
And the ghost had us
look where he wanted.

798
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,200
Look, I wasn't suggesting
That you're not a good profiler.

799
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,200
You, either.

800
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
The best.

801
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,500
Yeah, except i'm not a profiler.

802
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,400
What?

803
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,300
Sam stopped by earlier.

804
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,800
Had some questions.

805
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,000
eli!

806
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,700
And I was a vault on
the whole ghost thing.

807
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,800
I didn't say anything,
not a word, not even a syllable.

808
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,400
The whole ghost thing?

809
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,900
Yeah. Sometimes you have to use
A smaller lie to cover the larger one.

810
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,600
What did you tell him?

811
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,600
He may have gotten the impression

812
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,200
That you sometimes
work for the government.

813
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
The government?!

814
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,100
Fbi, really.

815
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,100
Fbi?!

816
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,000
As a profiler, but
it sounds pretty sexy, right?

817
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,200
Hey!

818
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,900
- Oh, my god.
- ??

819
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,300
- Are you ok?
- ??

820
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,800
- Are you ok?
- I'm ok.

821
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,000
You were running so fast--

822
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,900
Jacob, honey, what happened?!

823
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,800
- I'm ok.
- You ok?

824
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm ok. I just fell.

825
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,200
What are you scared of?
Why were you running?

826
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,300
He said there were ghosts!

827
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,100
He said that?

828
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,200
Is that true?

829
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,200
You told this child there
were ghosts in his house?

830
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,100
No, I was trying to explain to
the parents how this all works--

831
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,400
Wait a minute, how what works?

832
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,800
How your camera takes pictures
of things that aren't there?

833
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,900
Or how to make out the check?

834
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,300
Sam, listen, i think that

835
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,100
You don't understand the whole picture.

836
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,200
No, I think I do.

837
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,700
The credit this guy
Is taking for finding a dead body

838
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,300
actually belongs to someone else,

839
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,700
And none of this has
anything to do with ghosts!

840
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,100
- Well, actually--
- No, I know this.

841
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,600
I'm not going to tell you
how I know this, but I know it.

842
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,700
No, you don't!

843
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,100
Melinda, you don't
have to defend him--

844
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,200
Yes, I do!

845
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,100
Linus is telling the truth.

846
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,600
What? I don't understand this.

847
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,100
It's all real.

848
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,000
Linus, the ghost, the machines.

849
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,700
Melinda, I can make you a ghost
detector machine in 5 minutes.

850
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,900
You need batteries, diodes, and--

851
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,000
Yeah, except I don't--

852
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,200
I don't need the machine
to tell me that it's real.

853
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,000
I see ghosts.

854
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,800
I have since i was a little kid.

855
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,300
All right, if this is
supposed to be funny, it's not.

856
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,900
??

857
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,100
Come on, come on.

858
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,600
What took you? I got everyone here,
But i'm a little stuck without my eyes.

859
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,600
Is this ghost ready
for the big crossover?

860
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,000
Why don't you ask him?

861
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,400
Well, he's here, i established that,

862
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,100
I just don't know
what kind of mood he's in.

863
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,200
Better than mine.

864
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,300
Oh.

865
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,800
Ahh, that thing with sam?

866
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,200
Let's just get this over with.

867
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,600
That's the attitude.

868
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,800
Carrie, hi. Um...

869
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,900
Your father's here, and I think there's
something he wants to say to you.

870
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,700
Not only her.

871
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,100
I want to say something to linus.

872
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,100
And to linus.

873
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,500
I'm sorry that i doubted you

874
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,400
When you told me
what you believed about ghosts.

875
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,300
I don't know if I can do this.

876
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,800
I remember when linus first explained
Where his belief came from.

877
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,300
His guardian angel.

878
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,500
He remembers when you told him
about your friend,

879
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,600
The one that died.

880
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,600
That was the first i brought linus home.

881
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,000
Probably not the best way
to make an impression.

882
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,900
I thought he was weak-Minded
to believe in such nonsense.

883
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,400
Until I was dead, i never...

884
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,400
Understood how alone he must have felt.

885
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,000
Or how strong he was to believe anyway.

886
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,600
Nolan says he never appreciated

887
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,300
How hard it must have
been for linus to believe

888
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,600
When everyone doubted him.

889
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
And to think my not believing

890
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,900
Might have ruined
their chance at love...

891
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,100
I couldn't go on until I made it right.

892
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,800
Nolan couldn't stand the idea

893
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That his doubt kept you two apart.

894
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,000
So that's when he found mrs. Bellsbury

895
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,300
And led linus to her.

896
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,600
He thought if linus got some
credibility for the case,

897
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,700
It would bring carrie back to you.

898
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,600
Is that about right?

899
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,200
Thank you.

900
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,900
Thank you.

901
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,800
You've given me the greatest joy.

902
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,200
He's crossing over,
and he says good-Bye.

903
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,300
Come here.

904
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,700
Why is it so hard?

905
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,400
What?

906
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,400
Believing.

907
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,700
Hey.

908
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,600
You got a minute?

909
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,600
You must hate me right now.

910
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,000
Hate you?

911
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,600
For making you feel
bad about...what you do.

912
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,600
Look, who the hell am I to--

913
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,700
It's not your fault.

914
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,000
It's just a sensitive thing for me.

915
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,500
Ever since i lost my memory,
and my life.

916
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,400
I try to latch on to
things that are solid,

917
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,600
And so it's made me allergic
to things that are...

918
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,600
Not so solid.

919
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,600
That makes sense.

920
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,200
It's funny.

921
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,400
Because some of the best things in
my life right now Make no sense at all.

922
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,400
Like what?

923
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,800
Like us.

924
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,500
We don't make any sense?

925
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,800
No, me waking up out of this coma

926
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,200
And the only thing i know
are my feelings for you.

927
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,200
I can't explain it. I--

928
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,000
I have to rewind the tape.

929
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,500
No, please, let's--

930
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,600
Let's not rewind the tape.

931
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:21,900
Right.

932
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
If you're looking for something solid...

933
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,000
What about ghosts?

934
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,800
Why would I let something
I can't see come between us?

935
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,300
Because this thing
that I do, it's--

936
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,000
it's a really big part of me,

937
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,500
And if you don't
believe in it, i--

938
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,700
Hey, you needed a little time
and a little space

939
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,300
To get ready to tell me this.

940
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,900
Let me have the same
to get used to it.

941
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,600
Take all the time you need.

942
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,400
all right,

943
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,000
thanks.

944
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:14,500
