1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,993
Previously on Nip / Tuck...

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,799
You look good.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,280
I found something
that I know can help me.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,193
- What?
- Scientology.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,555
I want to do an operation on the baby.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,074
It may take multiple surgeries.
I can't know that yet,

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,196
but I want to do it soon.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,269
Okay.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,752
Do it, Sean.

10
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,436
Like my new baby? 230 grand.

11
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,991
Spoils of the sale, my friend.

12
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,469
Four hundred and fifty horse,
top speed of 192 per hour,

13
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,198
multi-point sequential fuel injection,

14
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,795
and a color TV in the dash
so I never miss an episode of Oprah.

15
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,553
I picked up a new set of wheels myself.

16
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,474
Oh, yeah.

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,158
Sixty miles to the gallon,
and I can drive it in the carpool lane.

18
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,753
Check this out.

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,478
I had it installed this morning.

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,232
- Any day now, huh?
- Yeah.

21
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,834
- Nervous?
- Third time's a charm.

22
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,071
We're hyper-prepared this time.
No surprises.

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,789
Which is why I want you to have this
for when Julia's water breaks.

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,755
I mean, you were there
for Matt and Annie's births.

25
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,229
It's a McNamara family tradition.

26
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,473
Call my cell phone.

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,552
Beepers are for plumbers
and drug dealers.

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,471
You never answer your phone.

29
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,159
The line of my jacket's ruined, Sean.

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,553
Look, Christian, I need to take care of Julia
during the birth.

31
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,552
Allamby is adequate,
but I want a doctor there I can trust

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,154
in case there are any complications.

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,949
Okay.

34
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,036
What's so funny, ladies?

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,114
Linda, are you blushing?

36
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,679
- Yeah.
- Roll over. I want to spank your ass.

37
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,952
- Oh, baby. Huh?
- Yeah.

38
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,758
- Do you like it that way, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

39
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,070
Yeah, I want every inch of you, baby.

40
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,273
Oh, yeah. Here we go.

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,920
Oh, yeah! Touchdown, baby! Touchdown!

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,070
- Yeah! We're good!
- Touchdown, man! Yeah, baby!

43
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,479
Good! Give me more! Give it to me!

44
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,596
- Christian, is that you?
- All right, you want more, baby?

45
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,908
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,434
I can go all night.
I'm a goddamn juggernaut!

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,794
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

48
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,678
Where the hell did you get this?

49
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,389
Looks like you screwed over
one AV nerd too many, hot pants.

50
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,438
This was posted on YouTube yesterday.

51
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,478
It's gone viral in the last 24 hours.

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,714
Your fat ass has been downloaded
6,000 times, Christian.

53
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,679
This is bullshit.

54
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,558
It's also illegal. You could sue.
This is an invasion of privacy.

55
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,438
I don't give a shit about that.
Leaked sex tapes are gold.

56
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,397
But look at the angle
she's got on my tummy.

57
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,879
I look like Jabba the Hutt.

58
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,996
- Look at me!
- I'm looking at you!

59
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,354
Jesus!

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,431
The camera does add 15 pounds.

61
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,589
Yeah.

62
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,511
Say I'm the hottest piece of ass
you ever had.

63
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,273
Okay! Okay! You're the hottest,
sexiest piece of ass I've ever had!

64
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,999
- Yeah!
- Yeah! I'm coming. I'm gonna come!

65
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,838
Oh, yeah.

66
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,876
- What?
- Yeah.

67
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,799
- I'm gonna go wash it off, baby.
- Okay, baby.

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,352
Oh, yeah. What a body.

69
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,749
Holy shit.

70
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,988
Is that my ass?

71
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,431
Is this a stretch mark?

72
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,913
It's nothing.

73
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,591
You didn't get stretch marks
with Matt or Annie.

74
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,831
- Why worry about them now?
- I wasn't 40 when I had them.

75
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,957
Here, let me do it.
I'm not gonna let you have all the fun.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,399
Don't forget to be home early.

77
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,472
We have the interviews
with the nurses Linda recommended.

78
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,030
Of course. Nose jobs will have to wait.

79
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,229
This is my priority right now.

80
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,673
Do you think it's too early
to be hiring a night nurse?

81
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,309
If there's one thing I learned
from having two kids already,

82
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,197
it's that they don't give out
parenting medals

83
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,759
for being up all night.

84
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,878
His condition is gonna be
challenging, Julia.

85
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,437
The only way
we're gonna be able to handle it

86
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,317
is if we hit the ground running.

87
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,716
- Say it.
- This is ridiculous.

88
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,314
What's the difference?
You say it 10 times a day.

89
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,636
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

90
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,519
I'd like you to do some lipo
on my midsection.

91
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,669
You're overreacting.

92
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,352
My imperfections, while slight,

93
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,795
have been broadcast
for the whole world to see, Sean.

94
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,279
Now, I have a strong ego,

95
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,830
but when a whole city
starts looking at you as if you're flawed,

96
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,110
it's hard not to start believing.

97
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,994
I went to a club last night.

98
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,152
I could feel everybody's eyes
looking at my stomach.

99
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,232
Christian, this is classic
body dysmorphic disorder.

100
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,915
Look at yourself in the mirror.
You are a model of physical perfection.

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,072
I know, but I can be better. I know I can.

102
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,390
Would you tell a millionaire
to stop making money?

103
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,631
Do you say that "hottest piece of ass" line
every time you have sex?

104
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,119
Pretty much.

105
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,116
Fine, if you don't do it for me,
then do it for the business.

106
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,031
Plastic surgeons can't be fat.

107
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,917
There's an epidemic of obesity
in this country,

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,879
and it is our job
to exemplify a healthy alternative.

109
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,758
Passing on the Key lime pie
or that second bottle of merlot

110
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,559
might be a more reasonable way
to set an example.

111
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,959
- Diet?
- Yeah.

112
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,709
Is that what we tell
the 20 people a week who come in here

113
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,951
looking to get their spare tires
sucked out? No, Sean.

114
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,792
We're in the quick fix biz.

115
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,799
I went through the video
a few more times,

116
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,872
and I've identified these
as my problem areas.

117
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,314
I saw the video, too. I think
it's your ass you should be marking up.

118
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,911
Just put me on the books.

119
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,999
- How can you do this to me right now?
- Do what?

120
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,354
I'm having a handicapped son
in a few days.

121
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,910
How can you stand in front of me
and be so superficial?

122
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,037
Well, I'm sorry. I...

123
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,159
I guess I thought you were doing okay.
I mean, you seem so on top of everything.

124
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,908
You need to talk? I'm here for you.

125
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,188
No, I'm fine.

126
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,840
It's just... There's still a lot to do.

127
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,592
I just think you should call your trainer
before you call your doctor.

128
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,116
15, 16...

129
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,158
You know, this would be a lot easier
if you came to see me more often.

130
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,992
Candy, I'm a plastic surgeon.

131
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,514
I don't have time to come down here
and sweat it to the oldies

132
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,999
five times a week.

133
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,869
Models and actors.
Nothing but time to work out

134
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,110
and jerk off
looking at themselves in the mirror.

135
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,795
Yeah, actually, he's not an actor.
That's Dr. Mike Hamoui.

136
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,031
He's a plastic surgeon, too.

137
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,799
Come on.

138
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,950
Let's go. Come on.

139
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,357
Nineteen. Come on, Christian!

140
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,035
Up, up, up! All the way! Let's go!
20, 20, 20! All right.

141
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,511
Are you staring at my dick?

142
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,830
No, I'm checking out your ass.

143
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,353
- Dr. Christian Troy.
- Dr. Mike Hamoui.

144
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,235
- McNamara/Troy, right?
- You've heard of us, huh?

145
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,835
Yeah, you guys were front-page news
for a while.

146
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,150
And I saw your video.

147
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,474
Seriously, though,
it's an honor to meet you.

148
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,189
You guys were the first place in town
to mix plastic surgery with style.

149
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,714
You paved the way, my brother.

150
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,672
How big is your practice?

151
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,399
Too big.
Just had to hire two new associates,

152
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,119
and we're thinking of
taking on a third next month.

153
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,998
I tell you, Christian,
this town is filthy with malakas

154
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,992
who will pay the big bucks
to look half as good as we do.

155
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,672
Let me ask you something.

156
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,474
How do you get that delineation
in your abs there?

157
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,993
I've been doing
a thousand crunches a week,

158
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,868
and I can't seem to get mine
to pop like that.

159
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,359
I don't eat.

160
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,794
Seriously. I have protein shakes
for breakfast and lunch and a light dinner.

161
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,598
And no refined sugars.

162
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,434
- And I'm in here every day.
- How do you find the time?

163
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,308
Well, the hour you spend
watching SportsCenter, I'm in here.

164
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,439
During your 45-minute lunch
at Joe's Stone Crab,

165
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,195
I'm jogging down the strand.
You gotta make the sacrifices.

166
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,237
Sacrifices?
You're a goddamn physical terrorist.

167
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,069
But I don't have to wait to get into heaven
to screw 40 virgins.

168
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,038
Look, thing is, I'm 33.

169
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,398
Your basal metabolic rate slows down
10% every decade after 30.

170
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,516
Now, you look great for your age.

171
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,479
But it's next to impossible for you
to look like me. Not naturally.

172
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,869
Hey, it's nice meeting you, huh?

173
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,551
Why the hell haven't you returned
any of my calls?

174
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,191
I didn't know you worked out here.

175
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,157
I've been trying to get ahold of you
for a week, Mattie.

176
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,878
I've been kind of busy.

177
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,270
Doing what? Handing out leaflets
at airports with Hare Kimber?

178
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,510
You see, that's why
I don't want to talk to you, man.

179
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,909
You're an SP.

180
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,959
- God damn it, I'm not superficial.
- No, suppressive personality.

181
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,718
That's someone who keeps you
from being your true self,

182
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,916
realizing your full potential.

183
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,754
- Who told you that, the self-help fairy?
- No, Kimber.

184
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,077
She's got a lot more to her
than you think, man.

185
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,276
Trust me, slick,
I know every inch of that woman.

186
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,157
She's nothing more than
a bleached-blonde vampire,

187
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,470
and you need to stay
the hell away from her.

188
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,913
Wait, Mattie. Mattie, Mattie, wait!

189
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,952
Come on.
After everything you've been through,

190
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,996
you're vulnerable right now, that's all.

191
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,196
Kimber feeds off that.
You can take my word for it.

192
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,669
Since when did you become
the moral authority?

193
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,070
All you care about is women,
how to abuse them,

194
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,991
and maybe flashy cars.

195
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,956
Look, I just can't have you
in my life right now.

196
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,432
All right. How long is this gonna last?

197
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,199
Until I decide.

198
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,390
I'm getting my nursing degree at Barry.
That's why I moved down from Akron.

199
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,469
Yeah.

200
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,877
And have you worked
with handicapped children before?

201
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,110
I prefer "handi-capable. "

202
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,634
The child doesn't think
there's anything wrong with him.

203
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,756
It's just the way life is.

204
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,310
I hope it's okay,

205
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,868
but when Nurse Linda told me
of your child's condition,

206
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,757
I did some research.

207
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,273
I assume, as a plastic surgeon,

208
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,113
you'll be performing
the reconstructive surgeries on him?

209
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,235
That's right.

210
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,595
Well, I'm very comfortable
administering medications

211
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,591
and changing bandages.

212
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,319
Now, poopy diapers, that's another story.

213
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,037
Well, Monica,
I'm gonna check your references,

214
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,997
but barring anything unforeseen,

215
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,390
I think that we'd love to have you
working with us.

216
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,591
Do you guys know
how often the bus stops

217
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,033
at the station on the corner?

218
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,669
- You don't have a car?
- It's being shipped from Akron.

219
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,637
I promise it'll be here before I start work.

220
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,269
You know what? This is silly.
I mean, it's pouring out.

221
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,954
- Sean will drive you home.
- Yeah, of course.

222
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,554
Are you sure? I won't melt.

223
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,270
Oh, please. He never misses a chance
to take his new hybrid baby for a spin.

224
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,553
Excuse me. The garage is back here.

225
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,558
So how are you doing, Dr. McNamara?

226
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,508
I don't mean to pry.

227
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,434
It's just that I've worked with a lot
of families with handi-capable kids

228
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,196
and it's always the father who takes
the back seat to everyone, even the dog.

229
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,872
We don't have a dog, but thanks. I'm fine.

230
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,952
I'm so excited to start working down here.
You know, in a big city.

231
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,750
Oh, Miami's great. You've got the beach,
the Everglades, lots of young people.

232
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,877
With your personality,
I'm sure you'll make plenty of friends.

233
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,154
Yeah.

234
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,828
I went to South Beach
when I first got here.

235
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,153
I know how far my personality will get me
next to those perfect bods

236
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,037
in their dental-floss thongs.

237
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,395
No, don't say that.

238
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,632
- You're a very attractive girl.
- For Akron.

239
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,710
Would you give me your honest opinion
on something as a surgeon?

240
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,678
What do you think
about this bump on my nose?

241
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,275
I always thought it sort of looked like
a permanent zit.

242
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,350
I wouldn't change a thing.

243
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,349
- Hey, you mind if I turn this on?
- Sure.

244
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,918
- Here. This one.
- Where's... I can't...

245
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,754
- You turn that. That's up and down.
- Oh, wow!

246
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,199
Cool.

247
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,193
Oh, yes! I love this song.
This would be my prom theme.

248
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,594
Mine was Stairway to Heaven.
God! Makes me feel so old.

249
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,110
God, I miss that time.
Nothing to do but chill and have fun.

250
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,758
No responsibilities.

251
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,960
All that ends when you have kids.

252
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,838
That feeling of freedom,
nobody demanding anything from you.

253
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,477
That's what youth is.

254
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,989
Yeah.

255
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,195
I guess I should try and enjoy it more
while I still can.

256
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,071
What's a wonderwall?

257
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,069
It's somebody you can always lean on.

258
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,438
No matter what you need,
they're there for you.

259
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,876
I don't understand.
How does an electric car run out of gas?

260
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,599
It's not a golf cart, Julia. It's a hybrid.

261
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,353
Electric and gas.
You still have to fill up the tank.

262
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,429
The electric engine's very sensitive,

263
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,116
and once you run out of gas,
it just shuts itself down.

264
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,832
I'm waiting for AAA.

265
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,593
Did you at least drop Monica off first?

266
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,240
It's just...
I'm sure she's gonna get other offers,

267
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,038
and I don't want her not to like us

268
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,634
just 'cause you made her
stand out in the rain for an hour.

269
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,711
No, she's fine.

270
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,992
- I'll see you later. I love you.
- I love you, too.

271
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,433
Be careful.

272
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,193
Did she buy it?

273
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,477
Look, Monica, I'm sorry...

274
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,075
No, I'm sorry, Dr. McNamara.

275
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,636
I have to stop doing this.

276
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,551
You've done it before?

277
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,837
Just once, with a father
I worked with in Akron.

278
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,230
That was after I worked for them
for, like, two years,

279
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,757
and his wife was a total bitch.
Not like your wife.

280
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,039
I've just been so lonely since I moved here,

281
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,553
and I know it's silly, but I miss him.

282
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,154
And you kind of remind me of him.

283
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,392
I don't think it would be appropriate
for you to work for us, Monica.

284
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,358
I understand.

285
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,994
Screw you, Monica.

286
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,912
Every time you get close
to something perfect,

287
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,991
you have to ruin everything.

288
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,040
Randall, the dad from Akron,

289
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,956
he used to tell me
I made love like an ugly girl,

290
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,674
grateful for whatever I could get.

291
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,477
I need to go. Can you take me home now?

292
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,356
What's the point, right? Lipstick on a pig.

293
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,229
That's what Randall used to say.

294
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,392
Why don't you let me
do something for you?

295
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,754
I thought we didn't have anything
till 10:00.

296
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,115
I thought you were meeting
with your trainer this morning.

297
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,997
She canceled. Food poisoning.

298
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,868
- Who's this?
- Family friend. Deviated septum.

299
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,393
Poor girl can hardly breathe.

300
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,314
Nobody tells me anything.
I thought we didn't have surgery till 10:00.

301
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,995
Just a deviated septum.
Nothing I can't handle on my own.

302
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,037
- Isn't that Monica Wilder?
- Who's Monica Wilder?

303
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,158
She's the night nurse
I referred to Sean and Julia.

304
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,151
I didn't know she had a deviated septum.

305
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,798
So you'll give your night nurse a nose job,

306
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,598
but you won't give your partner
some lunchtime lipo?

307
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,513
She's not my night nurse.
We didn't hire her.

308
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,269
She didn't really have enough experience.

309
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,593
You porked her.

310
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,390
This girl can't breathe
during allergy season.

311
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,755
Her needs are totally different
from yours. Mallet.

312
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,674
The only difference is that you deviated
your dick into her, hypocrite.

313
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,350
She has a deviated septum.

314
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,436
Can I help?

315
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,950
Yeah, sure. Sure. Thank you.

316
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,553
No problem.

317
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,672
I really appreciate all of the upgrades
that you've made around here.

318
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,429
Well, I really appreciate
appreciative employees.

319
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,793
It's so nice to have a woman in charge.

320
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,151
Well, the boys need to know
that we can do a lot more

321
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,993
than answer phones
and make a good cup of coffee.

322
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,833
Thank you.

323
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,755
Michelle?

324
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,355
I just want you to know
that I was in the same boat as you

325
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,158
when I got my memo.

326
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,993
I wasn't married, but I was
living with a guy when I came out.

327
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,878
Came out? What are you talking about?

328
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,428
Well, I saw you in the parking lot

329
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,396
with your girlfriend.

330
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,392
She's just a friend.

331
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,110
She was fondling your breasts.

332
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,118
I just want you to know
that if you ever want to talk,

333
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,713
then I'm here for you.

334
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,477
Hey.

335
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,993
We paid over $1,000 for this thing

336
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,355
and the instructions
don't make any sense!

337
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,838
I think someone has the new-daddy jitters.

338
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,039
It's just that with him coming
and selling the business,

339
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,509
it's a lot of change all at once.

340
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,915
Don't worry. I can handle it.

341
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,277
Well, can you handle a little more?

342
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,074
I just got off the phone
with Monica Wilder.

343
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,678
- What did she say?
- She's passing on the job.

344
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,235
- Why?
- She's moving back to Akron.

345
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,313
She said she found everyone in Miami
too image-conscious.

346
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,791
Hey, relax. We'll find someone else.

347
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,839
Are you okay?

348
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,518
Honey, is there something
you want to talk to me about?

349
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,828
No. Why?

350
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,356
It's just that you're my husband
and I know that when you get upset,

351
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,193
you know, you get effective.

352
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,556
You manage the stuff
to manage your anxiety.

353
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,475
Now, this baby is coming home
to two people who love each other,

354
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,949
and that's all he's gonna need.

355
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,593
- Jules.
- Dr. Allamby said

356
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,796
we should start having sex.

357
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,072
It induces labor.

358
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,398
Maybe we should wait.

359
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,710
Till we've found another nanny
and the nursery's finished?

360
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,910
Yeah, you're probably right.

361
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,593
I'll talk to Linda,

362
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,638
have her suggest a few more candidates.

363
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,552
- Okay.
- I'll hold this, and if...

364
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,756
- Yeah.
- Remember, you need the screw.

365
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,957
No, I've got the screw, but it's...
I'm trying to screw it in there.

366
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,594
Two gastric bypasses,
three surgeries to remove excess skin,

367
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,079
now a pannus removal.

368
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,390
Maybe he should have
just laid off the guacamole.

369
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,515
It's not that easy, Liz.

370
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,512
With the amount of high-calorie choices
available to consumers these days

371
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,398
and the enormous portions
restaurants shove in your face,

372
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,550
surgery is some people's only option.

373
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,473
Standing proud
with your fat-ernity brother, Christian?

374
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,836
You know, you can't hide behind those
slimming scrubs anymore, super-chub.

375
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,433
I saw the tape.

376
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,590
I don't think it's appropriate to discuss
your new jerk-off material over surgery.

377
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,636
Oh, I didn't masturbate
to your sex tape, Christian.

378
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,358
I am not a chubby chaser.

379
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,671
Can you even find your weedy cooch
under that massive gunt of yours?

380
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,909
Listen...

381
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,440
Michelle, will you stop
contaminating the sterile environment?

382
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,839
This will only take a minute.

383
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,037
I won't tolerate sexual harassment
in my office.

384
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,680
- Finally.
- Liz, you're fired.

385
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,953
You can't fire Liz, Michelle.

386
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,519
This is my practice, Sean.

387
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,909
I won't stand for an employee
feeling pressured sexually,

388
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,797
and that includes me.

389
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,952
Since when is offering a kind ear
to a coworker

390
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,758
considered sexual harassment?

391
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,559
You turned an innocent encounter
I had with an old friend

392
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,949
into a lurid sexual tryst.

393
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,314
I won't work in an environment

394
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,358
where I have to worry
that every contact I have with a woman

395
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,715
encourages your sexual fantasies.

396
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,951
I am sorry if I offended you,
and maybe I went too far.

397
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,314
But I know what I saw.

398
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,597
- You saw what you wanted to see.
- What is that supposed to mean?

399
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,036
It means that not everyone is gay, Liz.

400
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,316
You can sing whatever song you want to
in front of them,

401
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,119
but I will not let your gay shame
cost me my job.

402
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,191
You know,
I thought having a woman run this place

403
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,872
was gonna make a big difference,

404
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,158
but with you, it's all espresso machines
and fresh carpeting, Michelle.

405
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,629
I am still working for a dick!

406
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,473
That's enough, Liz.
Let us handle this, all right?

407
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,835
I am not too proud to litigate.

408
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,395
Why'd you do that, Sean?

409
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,993
I was hoping
for a good old-fashioned catfight.

410
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,115
This is serious, Christian.

411
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,829
Hey, I'm with Michelle.
Fire the bitch. She's a man-hater.

412
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,155
Michelle, you're taking
a trivial misunderstanding

413
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,993
and twisting it into a substantial situation.

414
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,311
How would you feel
if I started going around

415
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,868
spreading rumors
about you and Christian being lovers?

416
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,995
That's entirely different.

417
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,514
Liz isn't inventing what she saw
out of whole cloth.

418
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,398
- You're saying you believe her?
- Look, it doesn't matter what I believe.

419
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,072
We all have lives outside of the office.

420
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,798
You're proving my point.

421
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,872
Once accusations start to fly,
it doesn't matter if they're true or not.

422
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,033
Her lie is a threat to my authority
and my marriage.

423
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,237
Michelle, you've earned the staff's respect.
They love you.

424
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,949
But they love Liz more.
If you fire her, you'll lose them.

425
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,435
She's on probation.

426
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,750
One more strike and she's out.

427
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,709
Great. I gotta get to my training session.

428
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,190
Candy makes me do an extra
couple of lunges for every minute I'm late.

429
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,839
This lunchtime lipo's fantastic.
It's the 21st century bulimia.

430
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,514
And it's 40% of my Wednesday schedule.

431
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,750
People eat Big Macs all week,
then come in here

432
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,354
to have them sucked off their hips
in time for the weekend.

433
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,115
- We can't all have your genes.
- You don't want my genes, Christian.

434
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,112
In São Paulo
they call my family as Gorduras.

435
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,156
That's Portuguese for "the Fats. "

436
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,674
I can't even visit them anymore
with their pão de queijo

437
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,149
and pounds of pork
they shovel into themselves.

438
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,708
It's like visiting a stable.

439
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,758
Lighten up, there, buddy.
They're not serial killers.

440
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,310
Oh, but they are.
They're slowly murdering themselves.

441
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,990
Being fat isn't a handicap
you're born with, Christian.

442
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,275
It's a lifestyle choice.

443
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,078
You want to give me an eight-pack?
Tilt that cannula at 45 degrees.

444
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,549
I want my come gutters to run deep.

445
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,277
I drive a Ferrari Diablo.
Want to know why?

446
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,510
Nowhere for the backseat driver to sit.

447
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,989
You keep joking, junior.

448
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,911
Ten years from now,
you'll be lying on my table,

449
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,831
I'll be sticking that thing into you.

450
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,512
Time is a bitch.

451
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,956
So how come your partner
isn't doing this for you?

452
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,395
I hear he's a hell of a surgeon.

453
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,317
Oh, we don't have time
for any in-house freebies.

454
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,316
Besides, Sean's got a lot on his plate.
His wife's about to have a baby.

455
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,117
I understand if I make you uncomfortable.

456
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,919
Most couples have a hard time
with a male nurse.

457
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,079
That was a joke.

458
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,389
Oh.

459
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,873
Yeah, I actually asked Nurse Linda
to refer a couple of male candidates.

460
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,632
I thought it'd be nice
to have a masculine influence

461
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,199
around the house while I'm at work.

462
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,317
That's very forward-thinking of you,
Dr. McNamara.

463
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,837
Most men get a little territorial
about having another man in their home.

464
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,759
I see you have a degree in art restoration.

465
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,638
That's very unusual for a nurse.

466
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,632
Yeah, well, if I was half as good a painter
as I am a nurse,

467
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,950
that degree might be worth something.

468
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,315
I still paint, just more like a hobby.

469
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,510
And have you worked
with handi-capable children before?

470
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,954
"Handi-capable. "

471
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,157
That's like calling me "height-challenged. "

472
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,074
The worst thing you can do for your son
is tiptoe around his condition.

473
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,549
I speak from personal experience.

474
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,399
Luckily, it looks like we're gonna be able
to reconstruct his hands

475
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,232
with a series of surgeries.

476
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,358
Can I ask why you've decided to operate
before you've even met him?

477
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,756
We feel it's his best chance
to live a normal life.

478
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,068
Okay, but don't you think it's important
to hold his hand before you change it?

479
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,194
Well, thank you for coming by,
Mr. Sawyer.

480
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,873
We'll let you know.

481
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,677
Do me a favor, Julia.

482
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,553
Native Americans believe
that if you look a child in his eyes

483
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,757
the moments after it's born,
you can see his soul.

484
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,990
When they hand your son to you,
can you do that for me?

485
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,635
Sorry about that, Julia. I had no idea.

486
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,751
It'll be all right. We'll find someone.

487
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,798
You better do it soon.
My water just broke.

488
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,036
Christian, where are you?
I paged you nine times.

489
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,749
The baby's breeched.

490
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,274
We're gonna have to do
an emergency cesarean.

491
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,555
We're going to start, Doctor.

492
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,869
Get here.

493
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,037
- Is our baby okay?
- Absolutely.

494
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,316
Late-term breeches occur
about 4% of the time.

495
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,550
He'll be out in three minutes.

496
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,119
Ten-blade.

497
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,836
Make sure you're in the pubic crease.

498
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,911
Otherwise, she'll never be able
to wear a bikini again.

499
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,833
I've done a few of these before, Doctor.

500
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,078
She's doing great.

501
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,672
- It's okay.
- No.

502
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,718
It's okay. It's okay.

503
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,279
Okay, almost.

504
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,873
He's out.

505
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,029
Okay.

506
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,473
Hey.

507
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,672
What do you think, honey?
Does he look like a Conor?

508
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,231
He looks like you, Dad.

509
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,349
- What is she doing?
- Diaper check.

510
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,591
- Let me go!
- No. Hey, no. I'll go.

511
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,357
She'll get used to it.

512
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,751
Hi, Mr. Sawyer?
It's Julia McNamara calling.

513
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,268
Yes, I had the baby,
and we're fine, thank you.

514
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,560
Look, I was wondering if you'd
still be interested in working for us.

515
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,991
- Does he have a name?
- Conor.

516
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,590
Jesus, Sean, he's beautiful.

517
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,473
Look, I'm sorry, but it was just his birth.

518
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,869
Everybody has one. Nobody remembers it.

519
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,678
Call me when the kid needs stitches

520
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,115
or wants to learn
how to tie a Windsor knot.

521
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,276
He didn't need you, I did.

522
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,759
I know. I'm sorry.

523
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,471
I'll make it up to you.

524
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,311
What's wrong with you?

525
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,789
Lipo.

526
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,278
How are his hands?

527
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,789
English
