1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,235
Previously on Nip / Tuck...

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,469
Push.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,949
What are you gonna do?

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,838
I'm not gonna walk away
over dumb shit like DNA.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,639
He's not your son, Christian. He's mine.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,598
What are you saying, James?
That you're taking Wilber home with you?

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,669
Yes.

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,878
I simply need the use of McNamara/Troy
three nights a week after hours.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,678
No one need know about it.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,998
We just don't belong together anymore.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,632
You think she'll like it?

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,035
- I could get her the earrings to go with it.
- Yeah, sure.

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,429
She can carry it
in her Barbie Bling Bling Bag

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,875
along with her Little Mermaid Tiara.

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,918
Annie's only 12, Dad.
Don't you think it's a little extravagant?

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,709
I think she'll love it.
She'll look just like a princess in it.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,720
You know, she is coming to see you, Dad.
Not for all the loot.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,835
I know.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,433
This is the first time
we'll be opening presents

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,635
without your mother and me together.

21
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,358
I want it to be special.

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,988
- Listen, Dad, I...
- Hey, what do you think?

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,549
For your mom?

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,190
I know it's sort of weird,
but I'd like to get her something.

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,191
I mean, it's Christmas, right?

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,316
It just feels so strange, you know?

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,278
Her being in New York with Erica
and not with us.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,755
It's her.

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,710
Your mother's got a sixth sense, especially
when it comes to buying her presents.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,789
Hey.

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,794
Mattie and I are just picking up
a few things for Conor and Annie.

32
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,793
Did she see a doctor?

33
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,919
Did he prescribe...

34
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,629
Good.

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,476
That should clear it up
within a week or so.

36
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,118
Kiss her for me, okay?

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,075
And Conor.

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,872
Tell them their presents are coming
by reindeer express.

39
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,475
Okay.

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,749
Strep.

41
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,438
What are you gonna do?

42
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,400
Looks like it's just you,
me and Kimber, bud.

43
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,639
Listen, Dad.
I'm sorry, I should've told you sooner.

44
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,633
Kimber and I are going on the Freewinds
Scientology Cruise for five days.

45
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,199
We're not gonna be here.

46
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,679
Well, you should've told me, Matt.

47
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,558
I was really counting on the family,
or what's left of it, being together.

48
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,119
I know, it's just...

49
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,152
You know, I got my new family now.

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,512
And it's really important to Kimber.

51
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,797
It's a chance for her
to advance to the next level, and...

52
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,311
You know, I can't not go.

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,472
Don't worry about it.
We'll celebrate when you get back.

54
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,829
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,797
Why don't we grab
a cappuccino or something at the bar?

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,274
Gotta get home.

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,588
- Jesus.
- I know.

58
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,917
It's my night to make dinner.

59
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,909
Come here.

60
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,717
Merry Christmas, Dad.

61
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,032
Can I get another?

62
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,719
A dollar?

63
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,118
That the best you can do?

64
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,953
Come on, bro. 'Tis the season.

65
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,469
You know what?

66
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,155
You're a healthy white dude,
who's industrious enough

67
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,834
to appropriate a Salvation Army bucket
during peak season,

68
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,909
so you know what I think?

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,592
A dollar's more than generous, okay?

70
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,398
Now don't be so sensitive.

71
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,756
I just have to do my major fundraising
this time of year.

72
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,239
My name is Reefer.

73
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,918
It's not what you think.

74
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,156
I was a surfer when I was young,

75
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,198
and the name just sort of stuck,
for other reasons.

76
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,359
I knew something smelled
like my old dorm room.

77
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,715
Jesus.

78
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,320
Hey, man, I didn't steal this bucket.

79
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,118
- I found it.
- Right.

80
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,475
Next to a woman in a bonnet,
ringing a bell?

81
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,471
You stay sober, Reefer, and who knows?

82
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,437
Maybe Santa'll bring you a job
for Christmas.

83
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,748
I got your job right here.

84
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,558
- Oh, yeah.
- Asshole!

85
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,995
Crystal. 250 bucks each. No two are alike.

86
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,356
My sister and I
used to make our own decorations.

87
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,113
Popcorn, cotton balls for snow.

88
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,350
Sometimes we'd take
the tops off aluminum cans

89
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,874
and punch holes through them
so the light could shine through.

90
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,154
From cans to crystals.

91
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,754
- You've come a quite long way, baby.
- I know.

92
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,193
But I sort of miss making
something from nothing, you know?

93
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,750
And the tree.
We would wait till the last minute,

94
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,796
pick up the bargain leftover.

95
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,237
Sometimes the branches were half-dead,
but at least it was real.

96
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,639
So's this.

97
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,152
I see we're getting an early start
on the festivities.

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,433
Are these the same ornaments
from last year?

99
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,638
A slight upgrade, my friend.
It's a harbinger of things to come.

100
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,359
I just got an eight-footer this year
for Annie.

101
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,590
She's got strep and can't come.

102
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,109
Hey, why don't you guys stop by?

103
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,873
It wouldn't be Christmas Eve without
Christian Troy's famous mulled cider.

104
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,195
We can't. We're going to St. Petersburg.

105
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,510
Christian booked a room
at the Grand Hotel.

106
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,794
Impulse travel.

107
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,395
We're gonna spend a white Christmas
somewhere we've never been.

108
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,668
Some impulse.

109
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,108
Can I come?

110
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,635
Kidding.

111
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,629
Impulse response. Really? That's great.

112
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,198
You guys deserve it.
Give my best to Putin.

113
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,116
Hey, Sean, Sean, wait up a sec!

114
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,153
I need to give you my 10:30 consult.

115
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,516
It's a little,
kind of, provocative for me at this point.

116
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,398
Just consider it
an early Christmas present.

117
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,112
And by the way, there's a gift for you
from Diana Lubey.

118
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,629
It's on your desk.

119
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,189
Mrs. Hickock, tell me,
what you don't like about yourself?

120
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,033
I'm a frigid bitch, according to Hickie.

121
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,229
- Hickie's your husband, I presume?
- Yeah. Well, Hickie is his pet name.

122
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,154
It was either Hickie or Cock,
usually followed by "sucker. "

123
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,313
- We're getting divorced.
- Sorry.

124
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,389
So, Hickie was unable to satisfy you?

125
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,711
It's not that I don't like sex. I enjoy sex.

126
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,279
It's just I rarely could go over
the waterfall, if you know what I mean.

127
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,115
So for Christmas this year, I have decided
to ask Santa for a killer orgasm.

128
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,478
And a new wardrobe.

129
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,029
I see.

130
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,238
Well, since I'm not a couturier, I assume
you're here for a G-spot amplification.

131
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,356
If that's where you inject Restylane
into my cooch

132
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,034
and I come like a house afire, then yeah.

133
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,915
Yes.

134
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,518
Just because my marriage is over,
doesn't mean my life is.

135
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,556
That's a very healthy attitude.

136
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,111
I'm going through a divorce myself
and the holidays...

137
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,310
Well, so far they sort of suck ass.

138
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,352
Well, see, we've gotta be proactive.

139
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,238
'Tis the season to stop thinking of others.

140
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,958
We've gotta start thinking
about ourselves!

141
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,508
For instance, what are you
gonna get yourself this holiday season?

142
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,715
New suit, perhaps?

143
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,075
Something a little less brown, maybe?

144
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,355
Sorry. I'm just rambling.

145
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,996
I guess I'm nervous. Needles.

146
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,559
It's actually an easy outpatient procedure,

147
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,315
whole thing takes 20 minutes,
once we zero in on our target.

148
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,956
The G-spot is actually

149
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,717
a web of nerve endings and blood vessels

150
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,469
located on the anterior wall of the vagina.

151
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,596
It can be tricky to find
if you're not used to it.

152
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,070
Sometimes you need a helping hand.

153
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,679
It's somewhere beneath the urethra
and extending to the cervix.

154
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,714
Now, let me know
when you feel a tingly sensation.

155
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,949
Okay.

156
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,356
You know,
you'd look really great in Versace.

157
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,759
Well, thank you.

158
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,231
There's a spongy area that gets
engorged during arousal,

159
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,629
feels like a little red bean.

160
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,553
The injection swells it,
makes it easier to find.

161
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,151
Just do me a favor.
No more Brooks Brothers, okay?

162
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,796
You're a young, good-looking guy.
You've got your whole life ahead of you.

163
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,108
So do I.

164
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,639
We gotta stop living for assholes
who don't care anything about us.

165
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,280
We gotta start taking care of ourselves,

166
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,799
making ourselves happy,
'cause hey, you know what?

167
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,556
Hey, we're the only ones who can do it!
Do it! Do it!

168
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,952
Oh, do it! Do it! Daddy, do it! Oh, do it!

169
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,509
Oh, do it.

170
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,429
Oh, God.

171
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,917
I'm sorry. Sorry to interrupt.
I knocked but you didn't...

172
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,358
No, it's fine. I was just...

173
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,352
- What can I do for you?
- I'm Wendell Sutherland.

174
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,878
You knew my father. James?

175
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,956
Of course. Of course, yeah.

176
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,629
Come in.

177
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,313
How's your father?

178
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,710
My parents were both killed
in a car accident,

179
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,479
two weeks ago
on their way back from church.

180
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,919
I'm so sorry, I...

181
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,758
- What about Wilber... I mean, Gabriel.
- He's fine.

182
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,071
And it's still Wilber.

183
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,310
Little brother wouldn't answer to
anything else, so they gave up.

184
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,630
Said they didn't want to confuse him.

185
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,559
If you ask me,
the kid's got a stubborn streak.

186
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,519
My father named you legal guardian
in his will.

187
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,673
Wow, it's just...

188
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,598
I'm just a little stunned.

189
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,718
Why didn't he give him to you
or your brother?

190
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,152
It was hard on us
when my father brought Wilber home.

191
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,749
My mother never really got over it.

192
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,754
His betrayal.

193
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,870
It suddenly changed everything,
having this baby in the family.

194
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,188
As for me and my brother,
we're both in no position right now.

195
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,589
We have our own futures to think about.

196
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,756
My father always talked
about how much you loved him.

197
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,831
I did. I do.

198
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,072
This is a lot to absorb.

199
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,718
What about his mother?

200
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,391
My father was very adamant that she have
as little to do with Wilber as possible.

201
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,755
He made that very clear in his will.

202
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,669
It's just...

203
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,559
I'm getting married.

204
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,393
Hey, I get it.

205
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,799
Life changes, huh?

206
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,790
If anyone's at fault, it's my father.

207
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,430
He should've let you take him
off our hands when you offered to.

208
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,720
- Congratulations on your wedding.
- Thanks.

209
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,915
Wait.

210
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,353
I haven't said no yet.

211
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,588
What'll happen to him if I don't take him?

212
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,516
The church'll find him a good home.

213
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,678
They're actually the best foster agency
in the state.

214
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,509
Damn.

215
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,915
Look who just stepped off
the pages of Gentleman's Quarterly.

216
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,915
What is that shit? Valentino?

217
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,109
Gucci.

218
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,232
I bet that ran you, what?
Two or three thousand, eh?

219
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,714
All right.

220
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,353
I get your point.

221
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,039
Jesus... Here's a five, okay?

222
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,194
Doc, when a man can afford
to look that good,

223
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,748
it is a sin to walk around in anything less.

224
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,037
Now what are you doing
with all that Brooks Brothers shit?

225
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,710
Forget it. We both know if I give you a suit
you'll sell it for a week's supply of Jack.

226
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,394
Hey, asshole, you think Jesus loves
you more just 'cause you got money?

227
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,035
No.

228
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,032
Do you think Jesus loves you more
because you don't?

229
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,640
You want to believe there's virtue
in your poverty? That's fine.

230
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,234
But don't accuse me of being an asshole
because I'm rich.

231
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,959
I'm not going to apologize for it.
I earned it, okay?

232
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,600
If it weren't for a lifetime
of hard work and sacrifice,

233
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,636
I wouldn't be where I am today.

234
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,679
It's all right, Doc.

235
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,632
Clothes don't make the man
any more than this does.

236
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,998
Pain is pain, right?

237
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,713
Who says I'm in pain?

238
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,115
Man, I'm drunk, not blind.

239
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,198
I'm sorry, Christian, but I can't.

240
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,314
I just finished taking care of someone.

241
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,718
I didn't expect
to be changing diapers again so soon.

242
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,238
It's life, Michelle.
Shit happens, unexpected shit.

243
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,719
Sometimes, you just got to go with it.

244
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,030
At least with Burt, I owed it to him.

245
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,750
But this isn't my child, Christian.

246
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,679
It isn't even yours.

247
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,870
He felt like mine when he was with me.

248
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,837
- I never even thought about it.
- What about his mother?

249
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,194
Why can't she take care of him?

250
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,794
His parents
wanted what was best for Wilber.

251
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,275
If I don't take him he'll go to
a foster home. I've been there.

252
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,396
I know what it's like,
I'm not gonna let that happen to him.

253
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,708
So you'd take him over me?

254
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,678
- I want you both.
- But if you had to make a choice?

255
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,315
Remember when I asked you to marry me?

256
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,272
And you said,
"Why don't we live together first,

257
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,157
"see how it goes, see if it's right?"

258
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,118
Well, why don't you just see how it goes?

259
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,515
Meet him. Hug him.

260
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,398
If it doesn't feel right
we'll talk about it then.

261
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,799
We have a problem.

262
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,551
Any idea why Escobar Gallardo

263
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,393
would be sending you a ham
as a Christmas present?

264
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,875
Not a clue.

265
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,712
Because he wants
to slaughter us like pigs?

266
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,598
Must be some kind of
twisted practical joke.

267
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,272
I'm just relieved it's not a bomb.

268
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,998
You were right to call the FBl.

269
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,275
He's obviously
trying to maintain contact with you.

270
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,999
Can you think of any reason why?

271
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,718
I can't. Sorry.

272
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,478
- You?
- Nope.

273
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,949
Just when I was starting to sleep
through the night again.

274
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,713
We'll be installing surveillance
cameras on the premises.

275
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,030
I'll also be assigning agents
to the periphery of the building.

276
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,396
They're pretty good
about being as unobtrusive as possible.

277
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,029
That would be wonderful.
I can't tell you how much safer I feel.

278
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,515
Good.

279
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,199
If you notice anything else suspicious,
don't hesitate.

280
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,079
- Thank you.
- Yes.

281
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,390
We appreciate all your help and...

282
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,038
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

283
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,835
That's a really nice suit. Gucci?

284
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,029
Nice tie.

285
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,559
Did you know that a dog chases his tail

286
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,598
when he finds himself in a dilemma
he can't resolve?

287
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,389
- You can't stay here anymore, James.
- It's pointless behavior, of course.

288
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,032
But they just can't help themselves.
Just have to keep trying.

289
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,078
- You have to listen to me.
- Or?

290
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,349
You'll what?

291
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,956
Tell the authorities? I don't think so.

292
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,231
You have way too much to lose.

293
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,516
Let's just put up
with this tiny inconvenience

294
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,794
till I fill my Christmas quota.

295
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,952
Christmas is going to have to come early
this year, James.

296
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,591
McNamara/Troy's now under
FBl surveillance 24 hours a day.

297
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,275
There's agents outside the entrance
until they set the cameras up.

298
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,312
So stay as long as you like.
Just make sure they get your good side.

299
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,549
Michelle.

300
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,832
Thank you for warning me.

301
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,832
That was generous of you.

302
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,113
I would like to think
that your decision to tell me

303
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,316
indicated that you still
have some warm feelings for me.

304
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,038
Think whatever you like.

305
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,509
You'd just be chasing your tail.

306
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,071
Thank God you're not finished yet.

307
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,639
- Hey, doll.
- Hey.

308
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,193
Poppy asked if she could be here.
He's one of her closest friends.

309
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,875
He was my neighbor for like 10 years.
The sweetest guy, too.

310
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,471
Oh, God. Look at that.
Is he gonna be able to walk?

311
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,834
Well, it'll take some time to heal,

312
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,549
but once we've debried the necrotic skin
and the pieces of melted boot...

313
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,709
Sucks.

314
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,158
Guy was playing Santa Claus for his kids
like he does every year,

315
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,198
except this time his ex incinerates him
coming down the chimney.

316
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,840
- Maybe he should've called first.
- He did.

317
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,999
They're in the middle of a divorce.

318
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,436
So down he comes, right on time,
straight into a lit yule log.

319
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,714
The bitch pretends
she forgot he was coming.

320
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,116
Can I get a little saline here?

321
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,716
Now everyone's so screwed, too.

322
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,560
He played Santa at our "What a Pair"
Breast Cancer Fundraiser last year

323
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,552
and he was amazing.
I mean, the kids were just all over him.

324
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,189
You know, they loved him and
he was on a high for months afterwards.

325
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,157
All that loving coming to Santa.

326
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,154
Hey, Sean,
what are you doing Christmas eve?

327
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,275
Well, that's really sweet of you
to ask, Poppy.

328
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,112
Actually, I've got this beautiful tree
if you...

329
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,273
No. I was just thinking maybe
you could play Santa.

330
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,636
You know, take some pictures,
have some kids sit on your lap.

331
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,472
You would be so cute.

332
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,791
Maybe some other time.
It's not exactly what I had in mind.

333
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,916
Okay, whatever, Mr. Scrooge,
you enjoy your little pity party.

334
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,914
Sorry I'm late.

335
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,830
What is this? The dynamic dyke duo?

336
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,230
This is one of Poppy's closest friends.

337
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,630
Come on, Lizzy, even lesbians
can enjoy a little levity at Christmas.

338
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,836
You look like you've got enough
to go around for everyone.

339
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,549
I am rejoicing.
"For unto us a child hath been born. "

340
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,551
Did I miss something?
You don't even believe in God.

341
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,313
I do now. Guess what. I inherited Wilber.

342
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,272
I know, I know.
It's a long story, I will explain later.

343
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,236
But my son is back.

344
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,073
Isn't that cool?

345
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,395
- Think he'll remember me?
- Well, he was very young, Christian.

346
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,392
Yeah, of course, you're right.
It's ridiculous. He won't remember me.

347
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,357
But you never know, he might.

348
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,959
Anyway, listen.
I gotta be out of here by 3:00,

349
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,155
'cause I gotta go to the lawyer's office

350
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,275
to make this whole thing legal.

351
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,432
I'm not letting anybody
take him away from me this time.

352
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,511
Go. What are you doing standing here?

353
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,874
You sure?

354
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,034
I owe you one.

355
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,798
Wow, that kid is gonna need
a shitload of therapy.

356
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,916
Fine. I'll do the mall thing.

357
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,911
Get me a new pair of boots and I'm in.

358
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,991
Santa could use a little loving.

359
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,229
I don't think that you understand

360
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,073
the gravity of the situation
that you put me in.

361
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,276
Maybe you're just getting used to
a completely new set of sensations.

362
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,032
It's like living on a roller coaster.

363
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,315
The first couple of times? Yeah, thrilling!

364
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,789
After a while, you just have to get off.

365
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,755
Shit.

366
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,120
Oh, God, oh, God!
Oh, God, oh, goddamn vibrate!

367
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,238
"Getting off" doesn't seem
to be a problem anymore.

368
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,597
- Are you drunk?
- No, of course not.

369
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,399
Yeah, you were drunk when you gave me
that shot, weren't you?

370
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,674
I knew I smelled it on you.

371
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,749
Don't be ridiculous.

372
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,310
Look, I'll give you some Hyaluronidase
to decrease the pressure.

373
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,436
This is just not a problem.

374
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,238
Mrs. Hickock? I'm Dr. Troy.

375
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,595
I believe you're unhappy
with your G-spot amplification?

376
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,999
Yeah, I'm unhappy.

377
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,514
Because of Dr. McNamara's
drinking problem,

378
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,511
it is not safe for me to drive a car,

379
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,079
or use my clothes dryer,

380
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,516
or, oh, my God,
show my face again in spin class again.

381
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,958
I'm sure that Dr. McNamara would never
operate under the influence of alcohol.

382
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,075
Absolutely not.

383
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,357
However, we would like to make sure
that you're satisfied.

384
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,873
I mean, pleased.

385
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,559
I would like to reverse the procedure

386
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,232
and offer you some
complimentary BOTOX.

387
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,392
This whole thing will be history
in a matter of moments.

388
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,598
Fine. Whatever.
Just do what you have to do.

389
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,639
I've had enough orgasms
for one lifetime and two vaginas.

390
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,470
You're just lucky it's Christmas.

391
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,109
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

392
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,597
- Wanna lose your license?
- No.

393
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,752
Then again, I didn't want
to lose my family either, but here I am.

394
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,150
This seems to be the only friend
I can count on for comfort.

395
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,438
I didn't realize
you were in such a bad state.

396
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,559
That's because you live in a remote
little country called "Christian-land. "

397
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,757
I would have been there for you
if you'd just lost your wife and kids.

398
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,071
I wouldn't be flying to Moscow with
my fiancée over Christmas on an impulse.

399
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,197
We're not going anymore.
We're staying put with Wilber.

400
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,037
Look, it's all so new, you know?

401
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,313
We need to stay together as a family,
to bond, you know what it's like.

402
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,757
Yeah, I know what it's like.
I had a family once. You were part of it.

403
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,196
Pretty stupid of me to think
that I'd be part of yours.

404
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,313
Come in.

405
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,158
His bags are in the lobby.

406
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,949
Wow.

407
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,988
Look at you. You're such a big boy.

408
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,750
You probably don't remember me,

409
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,592
but I remember you way back
when you were a tiny, tiny little baby.

410
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,829
Daddy.

411
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,392
Yes, I am your daddy.

412
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,631
We're gonna have so much fun together.
Did you know that?

413
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,957
And I'm going to take
really good care of you, I promise.

414
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,794
I love you.

415
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,910
Hey, guys. Hang on, Santa will be out
in just a minute, okay?

416
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,792
Okay. Where the hell is Sean?
We're getting a little backed up over here.

417
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,031
- Merry Christmas. Thank you. Okay.
- Merrily, come here!

418
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,078
Tell Santa to stop feeding his reindeer
and get his jolly ass out here.

419
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,513
- Hi.
- Got it.

420
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,312
Poppy says your break's up.

421
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,795
Hey, do you, do you know Marlowe?

422
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,309
- Marlowe? Which elf is he?
- He was my wife's elf.

423
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,469
I thought maybe you all knew each other.

424
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,110
Looks like Santa needs a little hand.

425
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,915
Are you a friend of Poppy's?
You know, lesbian?

426
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,079
I've been known to dabble.

427
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,275
But every now and then,

428
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,830
Santa's helper enjoys a good North Pole,
if you know what I mean.

429
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,831
Why you little ho-ho-ho.

430
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,073
So, what do you want for Christmas?

431
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,957
I want a GT full-suspension mountain bike

432
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,237
with a new hydroformed downtube
and a zero stack headtube.

433
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,993
Why?
So you can crack your head wide open

434
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,310
going downhill at breakneck speed?

435
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,868
Won't feel like such a big man then,
will you?

436
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,758
And I want a big chocolate cake

437
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,118
with chocolate bunnies and a whole
house made of chocolate-chocolate chip.

438
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,189
Great.

439
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,313
You want Santa to bring you diabetes.
Is that it?

440
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,118
Is your mom single? She's got nice tits.

441
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,910
And I bought her this beautiful necklace
with this little red crystal heart.

442
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,798
I'll bet she looks just like
a real princess in it.

443
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,232
You think she'll like it?

444
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,233
Okay, okay, you know,
Santa's a little sad today.

445
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,676
It's okay, one of his reindeer died.
Okay, so run along.

446
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,110
Thank you, Liz. You were right.

447
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,394
I'm so glad I did this.
Everybody loves Santa.

448
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,675
We're actually losing money
on these photos.

449
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,034
Santa is freaking these kids out.

450
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,633
Nothing but love, it's waves of love.

451
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,869
You want a latte?

452
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,349
A latte? Well, that'd be great.

453
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,637
Santa could definitely use
a little beverage.

454
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,830
Okay...
You want a little help to the workshop?

455
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,992
- I'm okay. I'm just a little tired.
- It's okay, it's all right.

456
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,231
- I know, sweetheart. I know.
- It's just too much love.

457
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,112
And don't forget,
this is not the real Santa, okay?

458
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,276
This one's just pretend.
So there's no need to get scared.

459
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,078
It's just Uncle Sean dressed up like Santa.

460
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,470
Oh, my God, Christian, he is so cute.

461
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,030
Wilber, you are adorable!

462
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,070
I'm your Auntie Liz.
And this is Auntie Poppy.

463
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,550
- And isn't he adorable?
- He is cute, don't get any ideas.

464
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,678
Well, we came to see Santa.

465
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,719
Right? Didn't we? And do a little shopping.

466
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,477
Yeah. Well, you know,
Santa is a little overwhelmed right now.

467
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,838
I think it's all a little bit too much
with all the stuff.

468
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,758
- Right.
- With Julia and everything.

469
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,992
And you know, Santa is in his workshop
and he's resting.

470
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,995
Did you hear that?
Santa is in his workshop.

471
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,274
Wanna go see if he's making toys?

472
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,759
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

473
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,192
- What are you doing here?
- Getting a suntan.

474
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,554
I come at night when it's not so crowded.

475
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,469
You don't belong here.

476
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,120
I don't belong anywhere anymore,
so why not here?

477
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,031
Right across from my office.

478
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,190
Hey, you should get that looked at.
It could get infected.

479
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,589
My HMO doesn't cover bum fights.

480
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,116
- You got in a fight?
- Yeah. I got paid 20 bucks.

481
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,998
It's the newest sport.

482
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,518
You get a couple of assholes desperate
enough to kill each other, then go at it.

483
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,235
I figured I could get some money
to buy my daughter a Christmas present.

484
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,877
Damn foster parents spent all the money
on their own kids.

485
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,799
What's her name?

486
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,149
Lucy.

487
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,877
She hasn't had a decent Christmas
since her mama died.

488
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,152
What the hell.
All the stores are closed anyway.

489
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,433
I'll do like you said,

490
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,874
just use it to get me some Jack
for another day.

491
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,309
Want some?

492
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,634
Go on.

493
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,951
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- What the hell are you doing?

494
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,712
Pain's pain, remember?

495
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,315
You wanna come down here
in the hole with me?

496
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,516
'Cause right now
you're just circling the rim.

497
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,433
If you fall down, you'll find
the walls are so steep you'll never get out.

498
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,272
That's where I wanna to be.

499
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,950
Where it's so dark nobody knows
who you are or what you've become.

500
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,389
I know.

501
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,998
You're just going through
the dark night of the soul.

502
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,909
But you still got light in you.
You gotta hang on to that.

503
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,158
Your nose looks broken.

504
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,591
And you could use some stitches.

505
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,877
My office is not far.

506
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,349
All right.

507
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,996
I think you're good to go.

508
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,268
What about you?

509
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,150
I think I'm good to go, too.

510
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,154
All right, then.

511
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,439
You know, there's only
one other patient in recovery.

512
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,351
Why don't you stay here tonight?
Warm bed. Quiet.

513
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,950
You can take a shower in the morning.

514
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,954
Clean sheets. It's been a while.

515
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,829
Look.

516
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,714
I don't know
what your plans are tomorrow,

517
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,829
but if you'd like to stop by my place,

518
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,353
have a bite to eat.

519
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,998
This is my address.

520
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,991
I'll give you a couple of suits.

521
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,155
If you don't mind brown Brooks Brothers.

522
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,117
Beggars can't be choosers.

523
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,358
You're not a beggar.

524
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,318
You're not an asshole.

525
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,514
Hey, Doc.

526
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,154
Merry Christmas.

527
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,151
Merry Christmas to you, too.

528
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,271
It's cool, huh? That's it.

529
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,278
You just put it on here
and then it's hanging.

530
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,319
There she is. Let's go say hello to her.
Come on.

531
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,998
Come on over. Come on.

532
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,034
Hi. You must be Wilber.
It's really nice to meet you. I'm Michelle.

533
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,636
And that is the most beautiful tree
I have ever seen.

534
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,428
Ever.

535
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,630
Can I help you finish decorating it?

536
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,916
Let's go show her
how to decorate the tree, shall we?

537
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,434
Give me a kiss?
Okay, come on, let's show her!

538
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,316
You can get up? Up the tree?

539
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,954
Okay.

540
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,189
Let's show her exactly how to do this.
'Cause I'm sure she can't remember.

541
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,759
Okey-dokey. Let's put it on the tree.

542
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,075
Hello?

543
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,398
Need anything before I go?

544
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,310
I thought the place was deserted.

545
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,916
I'm solo on Christmas eve, too.

546
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,118
There's a guy in recovery.

547
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,314
I don't know if you're up to it,
but he could certainly use a friend.

548
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,312
Yes. Well, we all could.

549
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,513
- Good night.
- Night.

550
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,838
It's awful being alone on Christmas Eve,
isn't it?

551
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,719
Care to join me?

552
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,713
I'm on the wagon.

553
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,508
On Christmas eve? Nonsense.

554
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,039
It's a 1991 Philipponnat.

555
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,119
It's perfection.

556
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,471
Makes life worth living.

557
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,393
Takes the sting out of being away
from one's family and one's friends.

558
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,118
- I don't have any.
- No?

559
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,239
Except a daughter.

560
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,675
- Far as she's concerned, I'm dead.
- That is so sad.

561
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,394
Well, we'll be each other's family
this Christmas eve, shall we?

562
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,318
After all, we're all alone.

563
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,153
Just the two of us.
Even the night nurse is gone.

564
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,749
- I'm James.
- That's a man's name.

565
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,674
In French, j'aime means, "I love. "

566
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,195
Reefer.

567
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,028
Well, that's the same in any language,
isn't it?

568
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,273
It's absolutely heavenly.

569
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,638
Bubbles going to my head.

570
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,991
Reefer, wouldn't you like to join me?

571
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,271
I feel pathetic drinking alone.

572
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,434
Just a little.

573
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,314
Isn't champagne positively magic?

574
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,435
One glass
and all your troubles vanish into thin air.

575
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,394
Cheers.

576
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,350
Why didn't you tell me he was black?

577
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,468
It's just not something
I ever thought about.

578
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,275
All I see when I look at him is him.

579
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,276
He's like a little angel
come to us on Christmas.

580
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,636
One of Burt's plant managers. Hello?

581
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,959
I'll be right there.

582
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,513
A pipe burst
in one of Burt's medical supply plants.

583
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,828
It's Christmas eve.

584
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,310
- We're just about to eat.
- I know. I won't be long.

585
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,391
I'll call you on the way back.

586
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,473
Oh, my God.

587
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,711
- What have you done?
- Such shock?

588
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,155
Surely in med school you must've
encountered a cadaver or two.

589
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,435
What kind of monster are you?

590
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,393
This was a human being!

591
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,029
He had no family or friends.
His only skill was drinking.

592
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,908
At least we gave him an opportunity
to contribute something to society.

593
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,399
And contribute he did.

594
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,710
Briana made a pretty clean sweep of him.

595
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,791
Of course his liver was useless.

596
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,273
She snuck them out in a Gucci travel bag,
a little Christmas present from me.

597
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,478
- Then what do you need me for?
- Clean-up, darling. Garbage disposal.

598
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,232
Or would you prefer that
I left him there on the table

599
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,799
for the FBl to discover in the morning?

600
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,949
I can't.

601
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,633
I can't do this any more, James.
I can't. Please.

602
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,077
Imagine trying to explain this
to your future husband?

603
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,391
It could ruin everything
you've worked for, n'est-ce pas?

604
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,713
I couldn't do that to you.
Not on Christmas.

605
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,078
And after I cut him up,

606
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,152
how do you suppose
we get him out of here unnoticed?

607
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,148
There are agents surrounding the building.

608
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,192
Do your work, darling,
and I'll attend to the details.

609
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,953
Mrs. Landau?

610
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,039
- Agent Kraft.
- Friend of yours?

611
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,190
- She's a patient. Was...
- Yeah.

612
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,593
She's been discharged for Christmas.
We're doing volunteer work together.

613
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,754
Need some help with that?

614
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,037
No, no we can manage. Toys.

615
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,158
We deliver them to the children's hospital.
Pass them around.

616
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,434
That's nice.

617
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,430
Thinking of others on Christmas eve.

618
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,592
Thanks for keeping an eye on the place.
It feels good to know that you're here.

619
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,189
Good night.

620
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,592
- Good night.
- Good night.

621
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,479
- Hey.
- Hey.

622
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,869
Wilber wanted to spend Christmas
with his Uncle Sean,

623
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,394
and I wanted to check up on Santa.

624
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,758
I was worried about him.

625
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,069
What happened to Michelle?

626
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,878
She come down with the flu
or something?

627
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,872
A pipe at one of Burt's plants burst.

628
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,315
That's price you pay for being in love
with a businesswoman, I guess.

629
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,997
Well, I've got some Christmas
chicken noodle soup cooking.

630
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,233
- Or we could order out.
- Chicken noodle soup?

631
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,512
Chicken noodle soup?
We love chicken noodle soup.

632
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,589
Do you like chicken noodle soup?

633
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,795
Do you like chicken noodle soup?

634
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,235
Do you like it?
Yeah, we like chicken noodle soup.

635
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,709
Hey, you wanna help me
finish decorating the tree?

636
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,554
Yeah? Come here. All right.
It's right in here.

637
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,870
- Can I come, too?
- Yeah, you can come.

638
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,909
See there?

639
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,908
We got this.

640
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,631
You hold it by the string,
and you put it as high as you can, okay?

641
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,914
Here. You just got to

642
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,638
pick the right branch.

643
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,755
That's high, too. Very high...

644
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,749
ENGLISH
