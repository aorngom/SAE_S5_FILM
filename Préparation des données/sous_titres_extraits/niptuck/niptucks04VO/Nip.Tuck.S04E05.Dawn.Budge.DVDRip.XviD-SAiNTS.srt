1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,349
Previously on Nip / Tuck...

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,592
What I'm having trouble with is getting
you out of my mind. How you touched me.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,433
Monica, I'm married.
We both made a mistake.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,556
I'm committed to getting better

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,393
and I've found something
that I know can help me.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,152
- What?
- Scientology.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,111
So who's the mystery woman, Michelle?

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,668
Her name is James. I'm indebted to her.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,352
Please, don't tell Burt.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,715
I won't tell him your secret,
if you don't tell him mine.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,949
What's your secret?

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,871
That I made love to his wife before dinner.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,312
The jig is up, sweetheart.

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,789
It's time to take your little
whore-and-pony show to a different city.

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,677
Michelle told me about your escort ring.

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,990
We haven't even ordered the wine yet,
Dr. Troy.

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,950
Shall we share a bottle of pinot noir?
I know we both enjoy the darker varietals.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,710
I don't... I don't think I can do this
anymore, Christian.

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,870
Last week you were seducing me
in the operating room.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,359
This is all happening too fast.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,036
I won't deny what we feel because of fear.

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,749
And I won't waste time playing games.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,192
Her pussy must have really purred
for you, Dr. Troy.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,671
Of course, Michelle has been known
to meow for her customers.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,988
It's why so many came back.

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,751
Is her husband aware of your relationship?

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,870
Burt can't find out about this.

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,995
He won't.

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,150
Of course he doesn't know.

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,590
So it looks like she has you right
where she wants you, Doctor.

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,516
I want you to stay.

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,190
You know I can't do that, Christian.

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,231
If I'm late, Burt will suspect something.

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,556
I'm already living one lie.
I can't live with another.

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,876
Then turn one lie into the truth.

36
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,349
Be with me.

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,235
She belongs to me.

38
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,517
- How much does she still owe you?
- The price is $500,000.

39
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,478
That's insane.
You're nothing but a street pimp.

40
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,473
Far from it. My girls are intelligent,
sophisticated women.

41
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,916
I just help them to get a little more
out of life than they would on their own.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,911
My deal with Michelle was very clear.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,958
I send her to med school,
she gives me four years of service.

44
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,238
She deserted me after less than two years.
The loss of income was substantial.

45
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,595
Perhaps, but nothing approaching 500k.

46
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,877
She's not worth that much to you?
Do you love her?

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,230
I don't have that kind of liquidity
right now.

48
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,433
Then I suggest you melt
some of your money.

49
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,873
Everyone has a price. Even you.

50
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,549
That Jaeger-LeCoultre would
look fantastic on your wrist.

51
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,392
I don't disagree.

52
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,189
Excuse me, I asked you here for
your help, not to watch you model.

53
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,032
Engagement rings, please.

54
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,513
Now, are you sure you want
to go through with this?

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,955
Don't get me wrong, I think it's great
that you and Julia are together,

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,792
but do you really have to
go ask her to marry you again?

57
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,155
I love her,
and I want to prove I'm committed.

58
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,753
To her and to our family.

59
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,075
Okay.

60
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,633
What about this one?

61
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,915
That's the one they sell to teenagers
who knock up their girlfriends

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,911
and only have their lunch money to spend.

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,151
We'd like to take a look at that one.
Right there, thank you.

64
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,753
You have exquisite taste.

65
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,355
This is a four-carat emerald-cut diamond
set in platinum,

66
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,193
with four one-carat
diamond baguette accents,

67
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,794
all of extreme high clarity and color.

68
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,394
It's beautiful. What's it go for?

69
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,670
$165,000.

70
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,918
It's a little out of my range.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,673
Would you excuse us for a moment,
please?

72
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,998
You banged the night nurse, Sean.

73
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,353
I'll take it.

74
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,034
Holy shit, is that Matt?

75
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,236
Keep your eyes on the road.

76
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,433
Did you know about this, Sean? Huh?
Did you see him?

77
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,351
He was picking up goddamn Big Gulps.

78
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,398
Julia said something about Matt
volunteering for his church today.

79
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,799
I'm sure it's harmless.

80
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,553
At least he's not dating Nazis
or transsexuals anymore.

81
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,518
I can't believe you're fine with this.
It's humiliating. For him, for us...

82
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,798
Julia thinks he's doing all right.
His grades are improving...

83
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,112
We're doctors, Sean,
wealthy, successful doctors.

84
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,873
Is this really what you want for him? Huh?

85
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,878
Hey, come in. You're gonna love this.

86
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,078
Sweating in here is really gonna go
a long way towards cleansing your body

87
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,469
of all the poisons you've ingested.

88
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,516
You've been taking your vitamins
and minerals?

89
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,751
No. It's not like
I was a drug addict, Kimber.

90
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,115
I just took the antidepressants
the shrink gave me.

91
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,474
We're all addicts, Matt.

92
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,313
Even without the poisons
of prescription drugs.

93
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,873
The average person's thinking
and awareness is clouded

94
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,873
by thousands of chemicals that are
put in our food and in our drinking water.

95
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,076
It does feel good.

96
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,951
It's pretty cool that you have a sauna
in your condo.

97
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,828
Yeah. It cost a fortune,
but it's worth every penny.

98
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,515
But doesn't it ever get lonely?

99
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,353
I mean, having this great place
and no one to share it with.

100
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,392
Sometimes. But I'm really so busy
with classes at church,

101
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,357
I barely have time to think about it.

102
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,029
When you do think about it,

103
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,749
what kind of man
are you looking for this time around?

104
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,758
Well, I want someone with havingness.

105
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,472
What's "havingness"?

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,676
It's self-respect and potential.

107
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,558
And the ability to communicate
with the things,

108
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,236
the possessions that come to you as a
result of the inner work that you're doing.

109
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,232
Tell us what you don't like about yourself.

110
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,835
Nothing money can't buy. I have
a few extra layers on my pound cake.

111
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,353
That's where you come in.

112
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,829
So you'd like some liposuction,
Mrs. Budge?

113
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,150
I mean all over. Even behind my ears.

114
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,356
Whatever it costs, I can afford it.

115
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,512
I hit the big Powerball, $381 million.

116
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,999
Maybe you saw me on Maury?

117
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,237
- Congratulations.
- Wow.

118
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,912
Excuse me. I won it.

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,833
I am the one who sat for two hours
in the humidity,

120
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,595
my fat ass in a broken-down lawn chair
just to buy my tickets,

121
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,477
while these two booger-eaters
were staying home

122
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,471
to watch a rerun of the Ghost Whisperer.

123
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,198
It was the second of a two-parter, Dawn.

124
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,633
And the only reason you didn't stay home

125
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,392
was 'cause you'd already seen it, Ma.

126
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,072
Zip it, Mallory.

127
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,070
Anyways, after I won,

128
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,118
the first thing I purchased
were the exact replicas

129
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,158
of the mirrors Louis XIV has in Versailles.

130
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,913
You know, France?

131
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,154
Fifteen grand apiece.
I would've paid $5 million.

132
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,234
After I had them professionally hung,
I looked at myself in them and I thought,

133
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,117
"Pudge Budge has got to go. "

134
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,668
It is time my body
matched my bank account.

135
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,029
If that's what you're after, hell,
you've been skinny your whole life.

136
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,157
She was only making 15 grand
down at the Jiffy Lube.

137
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,152
Can you sew her mouth shut?
I mean, literally.

138
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,596
Can you put a zipper on there?
Because I swear to you, I will do it.

139
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,878
Is there something you're interested in
having done, Mallory?

140
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,273
I want some new tits. Big ones.

141
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,550
Finally, something we agree on.

142
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,676
I mean, she's gotta do something about
those mosquito bites.

143
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,035
She's never gonna get a man
and move the hell out of my house.

144
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,634
And while you're in there,
do something about her belly button.

145
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,029
It's disgusting. Show the doctors, Mallory.

146
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,758
I always though it was kind of cute.

147
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,752
How the hell are you gonna walk around
South Beach in a tube top?

148
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,149
Look, Dwight, it's bigger than your penis.

149
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,878
Mr. Budge, we haven't heard
much from you.

150
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,155
Do you think your daughter should...

151
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,676
Excuse me. Dwight is my second husband.
He is not Mallory's father.

152
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,149
He is here
because he would like a bigger dick.

153
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,913
And those pumps?
A total waste of money.

154
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,078
So you'd like a penis enlargement,
Mr. Budge?

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,356
Hell, I don't know. I never
really thought about having an operation.

156
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,353
It never came into your head before
because we never could afford it, honey.

157
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,035
Now that's all changed, now.
We're the rich folks now.

158
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,954
It's time that we got what we deserve.
And we deserve these operations.

159
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,192
I have to say, Mrs. Budge,

160
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,273
McNamara/Troy won't operate on patients
who are uncertain in their convictions.

161
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,475
Oh, no, they want them.

162
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,949
It's all we talked about the whole drive
down from Pensacola.

163
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,190
All the same, Mallory, Mr. Budge,
you really want these procedures?

164
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,040
Yeah, I think Mom is right.

165
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,350
My outie, it scares people.

166
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,635
If it'll make Dawn happy...

167
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,993
I'll make it easy for you.
I'll pay you double.

168
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,313
Screw it. Triple.

169
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,116
We'll put you right on the schedule.

170
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,749
Just like I said.
Money changes everything.

171
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,837
Dawn Budge got me thinking.
Money talks.

172
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,391
- A Porsche?
- For Matt.

173
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,675
We need to do something drastic
to get this kid's attention.

174
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,193
I know the dealer.
We can have a car within a week.

175
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,236
You want to bribe Matt
into quitting Scientology?

176
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,878
Why not? He needs a car.

177
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,190
Besides, I'm sure when his janitor
buddies see him rock up in this,

178
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,635
they'll kick him straight back to reality.

179
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,349
You know, Sean, you've let Julia drag
you around by the short and curlies

180
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,271
with her accepting permissive bullshit.

181
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,554
I thought he'd grow out of it.
I thought he'd get bored.

182
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,269
Well, he didn't, and now he's picking
up junkie condoms on the side of the road.

183
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,511
You know, turning the other cheek
doesn't work with this kid.

184
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,079
It just makes him more defiant.

185
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,673
We need to go in waving a white flag.

186
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,150
Be his best friend and offer him
an alternative he can't refuse.

187
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,280
Julia will never go for it.

188
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,671
Then leave her out of it.
You wanna get Matty back, don't you?

189
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,909
- Dr. Troy?
- Yeah.

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,798
There's a woman waiting for you
in your office. Says you're friends.

191
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,359
What are you doing here?

192
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,079
Some other $5 skank
kick you off her corner?

193
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,388
Not exactly, darling.

194
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,393
I just thought I'd come by
and check in on my latest pet project.

195
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,790
Your first payment is due on Friday.
$100,000.

196
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,713
I'm not paying you a cent.
Go spread your herpes somewhere else.

197
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,597
I didn't know that Michelle was ready
for your relationship

198
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,749
to come out of the closet.

199
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,638
If you tell Burt Landau or anyone...

200
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,870
I prefer pictures over talk.

201
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,233
Shit.

202
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,916
Look, I wasn't kidding when I said
I wasn't liquid right now.

203
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,276
I just redid my apartment,
spent $200,000 on a car.

204
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,349
I just bought my son a car...

205
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,274
Then I have a proposition for you
that might ease your pain.

206
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,789
I'll knock down your first payment
to something more manageable,

207
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,839
say $75,000, if you throw in a hand job.

208
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,154
Don't be vulgar.
I want a hand rejuvenation.

209
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,316
I thought vampires
kept their looks forever.

210
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,072
Sometimes we need a little help.

211
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,314
You know, once I get you on the table,
any number of accidents could occur.

212
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,550
Well, that's not going to happen.

213
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,230
Or those photos,
they will reach their destination.

214
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,117
So I was thinking, you know,

215
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,395
maybe we should buy Matt a car.

216
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,468
You know, to reward him for doing
better in school.

217
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,231
Are you having an affair?

218
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,957
What... What are you talking about?

219
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,199
Well, tell me about 1-900-555-YOU-COME.

220
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,472
That? It's just a few phone calls.

221
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,798
It's a former patient.

222
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,113
I gave her a voice lift.

223
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,954
She's a phone sex operator,
and I just wanted to check in with her.

224
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,517
Make sure the work was sufficient.

225
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,637
There are $500 in phone calls here.

226
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,552
I stopped calling over a month ago.

227
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,833
I'm sorry. Just...

228
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,231
It won't happen again.

229
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,758
You know, I mean, I almost understand it.

230
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,993
You know, since the baby,
I haven't been available much.

231
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,958
I can't remember the last time
we made love.

232
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,197
You should know something, though.
We barely made it through Megan.

233
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,753
If I ever find out you have touched
another woman, I'm leaving. I'm gone.

234
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,593
That won't happen. I promise.

235
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,158
And... Do you... Do you need me
to buy you some pornography?

236
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,795
What do you like? Girl-on-girl?
Three-ways?

237
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,998
Interracial couples?
At least DVDs are cheaper.

238
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,149
You are the coolest woman in the world,
you know that?

239
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,310
You give me everything I need, this house,

240
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,316
our children...

241
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,799
I love you.

242
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,557
Sean, what are you doing?

243
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,358
I'm proposing.

244
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,158
Marry me again, Julia.

245
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,232
Morning, partner. I have news.

246
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,679
Julia said yes to my marriage proposal.

247
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,197
Well, look at you. Congrats.
You're on the road to redemption.

248
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,033
I can finally afford the wedding
she always deserved.

249
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,599
This time we'll go all-out.

250
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,116
Did you tell Matty yet?

251
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,037
No. He locked himself in his room all night

252
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,793
and then left this morning
before we had a chance.

253
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,269
You know, maybe the car
is overdoing it a little.

254
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,715
- We should wait till after the wedding.
- No, we can't.

255
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,712
I want Matt firmly back in the family fold
before the wedding.

256
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,915
You were right about the ring.

257
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,468
Julia's eyes popped out of her head
when she saw it.

258
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,711
And you're right about the car idea, too.
I went ahead and ordered it.

259
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,638
And Julia's fine with this?

260
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,598
Well, I brought it up last night.
She didn't blink.

261
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,675
Great.

262
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,915
How long is this gonna lay me up,
Dr. Troy?

263
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,473
Well, you'll be badly bruised
and feel like you got hit by a truck,

264
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,993
but you'll be on your feet again tomorrow.

265
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,278
Good. I can't wait to go buy out
all the size 10s down at the Maxx.

266
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,475
You know, T.J.?

267
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,909
Yeah.

268
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,634
You know, I can vacuum you down
to a skeleton, Dawn,

269
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,756
but I can't suck out the white trash,
now, can I?

270
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,876
You want real class,
you're gonna need a new face

271
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,757
and wardrobe to go with your new body.

272
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,633
Are you gay, Dr. Troy?

273
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,598
No. But for a price,
I will play Queer Eye for you.

274
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,669
How much?

275
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,795
50,000 bucks will get you

276
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,668
the Christian Troy treatment
at the best salons and boutiques in Miami.

277
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,150
- I'm in.
- Great. We'll start tomorrow.

278
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,392
I thought you said I'd be bruised and sore.

279
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,352
Beauty is pain, Dawn. Suck it up.

280
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,873
I forgot.
I'll need your share of the car by Friday.

281
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,075
No problem.

282
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,358
Oh, sweet Jesus!

283
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,151
Keep praying, Dawn.

284
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,434
More.

285
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,631
So, whose turn is it to have
a mid-life crisis this week?

286
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,156
You like it? 0-to-60 in five seconds.

287
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,117
It's pretty sweet.

288
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,196
Wow. I guess selling the practice
has paid off.

289
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,597
The car's yours if you want it.

290
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,758
What's the catch?

291
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,118
The catch is that you start acting
like a teenager and enjoying yourself.

292
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,431
You deserve this, Matt.

293
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,908
You're doing great in school. We know
it's been hard not having your own car.

294
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,877
And that's it? Nothing else?

295
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,474
We'd like to see you around the house
a little more,

296
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,994
have some more family dinners together.

297
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,513
We miss you, that's all.

298
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,112
Wanna go for a ride?

299
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,228
Yeah.

300
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,918
Let's do it.

301
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,714
- You got enough room?
- Yeah.

302
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,199
All right.

303
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,551
This is a hot car, Matt.

304
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,312
But not as hot as you.

305
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,029
I'm gonna need satellite radio.

306
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,598
Okay. Open your eyes.

307
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,108
Wow.

308
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,430
- You like it?
- It's nice.

309
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,954
You know what you said about havingness
the other day,

310
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,032
I think mine just manifested itself,
so I embraced it.

311
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,959
Well, havingness is the feeling
that you deserve material things.

312
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,679
So why do you deserve this Porsche?

313
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,917
My dads gave it to me
for doing better in school.

314
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,558
Don't be naive, Matt.

315
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,433
Christian and Sean are
suppressive people, you know that.

316
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,238
Yeah, but they're not influencing me.

317
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,799
Oh, they're just bribing you?

318
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,394
They're buying your affection
to manipulate you

319
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,674
into doing what they want.

320
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,320
And what they want is for you
to leave the church.

321
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,868
To choose materialism
you're not ready for

322
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,791
over your obligation to yourself

323
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,519
and your spiritual growth.
Look at it, it's clear.

324
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,477
I'm sorry, I can't be a part of this.

325
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,599
No, Kimber, wait. Hey. Whoa, wait.

326
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,591
Okay. What can I do?

327
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,319
You need to be in an environment
that will be supportive.

328
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,109
And I understand what you're going
through. I've faced all these temptations.

329
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,192
I've heard all the entheta.
Give me your phone.

330
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,873
We need to be stronger than ever now.

331
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,235
These are beautiful, Simon.

332
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,231
Thank you, Mrs. McNamara.

333
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,471
Now, paint me a picture
of your dream wedding.

334
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,555
Saint Mary's Cathedral for the ceremony,

335
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,870
because we couldn't afford it
the first time.

336
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,839
And then the reception maybe at
The Shore Club, probably for around 300?

337
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,148
And the wedding party?

338
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,631
I'm sorry, but all this is sounding
really expensive.

339
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,075
Simon, may I ask how much you charge?

340
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,754
My services start at $25,000.

341
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,071
I require three assistants minimum
for a wedding this size.

342
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,752
- That's not a problem.
- Great.

343
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,796
Now my availability.

344
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,677
I'm booked through New Year's,

345
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,035
which means we're looking at January
at the earliest.

346
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,271
Which I love because it gives you
plenty of time to get into gown shape.

347
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,079
With the new baby and all,
you might want to drop a few.

348
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,672
Sean, I don't think
we need a wedding planner.

349
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,909
But if you want a big wedding,

350
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,956
we need someone to take care
of all the logistics, honey.

351
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,430
I never said that I wanted a big wedding.
That was your idea.

352
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,230
I wanted it to just be us, you know.
You, me, Matt, Annie, Conor. That's all.

353
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,555
You two should discuss this.

354
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,797
- I'm sorry about this.
- Not at all.

355
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,549
You can keep the damn car.

356
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,996
What are you doing here, Kimber?

357
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,230
I'm helping Matt move out, Julia.

358
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,159
- Want the posters?
- No, just his clothes and essentials.

359
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,559
Who are you?

360
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,279
Parker works for the church.
She's here to assist.

361
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,033
Get the hell out of my house!
You're not going anywhere.

362
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,270
Your son is 18 years old, Mr. McNamara.

363
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,157
Legally, you can't keep him here
against his will.

364
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,559
Watch me.

365
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,315
Who are you calling?
More of your Kool-Aid drinking friends?

366
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,550
The police,
to report a parental kidnapping.

367
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,310
Matt, what is going on?

368
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,516
If you're upset about something,
talk to us.

369
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,272
Matt thinks that it would be easier

370
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,272
if he didn't communicate
with you guys right now.

371
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,920
Matt, this isn't what you need.
These people don't care about you.

372
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,399
Don't you get it, Sean?

373
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,995
You can't bribe him into quitting
Scientology with a $100,000 Porsche.

374
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,991
You gave him a Porsche?

375
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,799
I'm trying to do everything I can
to keep this family together!

376
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,472
Kimber was right.
You don't care about me.

377
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,118
You and Christian
just did what you always do.

378
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,395
You used money
as a replacement for love.

379
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,993
Sweetie, I... We...

380
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,231
No, look, Mom, I'm sorry. I just
can't stay here and be repressed.

381
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,275
How many more men in this family
do you have to corrupt, Kimber,

382
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,035
to ease your own pain?
First Christian, then Sean, now my son.

383
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,590
This is not a battle you are gonna win.

384
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,074
Nice ring. Looks like it worked on you, too.

385
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,114
There'll be some scabbing,
but once they fall off,

386
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,918
your hands will look 20 years younger.

387
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,515
I'm impressed with your work, Doctor.
My money's been well spent.

388
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,717
Despite the fact that at this hour, I
should be curling up on the goose down,

389
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,872
not slinking around your office
like a phantom pariah.

390
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,349
I'm doing this after-hours
because I don't want Michelle to know.

391
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,158
You deal with me now.

392
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,879
You're not going to tell her the sacrifices
you're making on her behalf?

393
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,355
And they say chivalry is dead.

394
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,469
She's fragile.

395
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,348
She already lives with too many lies.
She doesn't need to cover up another one.

396
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,908
I'm not the monster you think I am.

397
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,116
I have feelings for Michelle, too.

398
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,394
Deep feelings.

399
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,396
You and I, we're the same.

400
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,674
I'm not a lesbian.

401
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,035
I've only been with one woman, one time.

402
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,311
Michelle. I was in love with her.

403
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,076
And the feelings were not returned.

404
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,834
So you understand it's rather hard
for me to just walk away.

405
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,473
How do they feel?

406
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,709
Clean.

407
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,798
Untouched by time.

408
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,715
If only you could do the same
with my heart.

409
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,755
I'm gonna do something
that's a bit out of character, Dr. Troy.

410
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,035
I was planning on having fun with you
a while longer.

411
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,997
You are cute when you squirm.

412
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,958
But you have moved me.

413
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,311
After I receive all my money,
I will disappear.

414
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,473
I'll give you back the photos and I won't
bother either of you again, ever.

415
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,878
So where's my $75,000?

416
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,159
- It's all there.
- Of course it is.

417
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,876
And next Friday the second payment
will all be there.

418
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,390
James, I don't know where
I'm gonna get the money.

419
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,472
Darling, you're a smart man.
I'm sure you'll find a way.

420
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,869
Really, I don't think Chinese chicken salad
is anything to have as an entrée.

421
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,236
I'm a girl again.

422
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,312
You're a genius, Dr. Troy,
a frigging genius.

423
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,119
I look gorgeous.

424
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,154
Almost as gorgeous as my house.

425
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,834
My very own McMansion,
just like I always dreamed.

426
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,673
Don't you just love the place?

427
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,036
It looks like Liberace took a dump in here.
You have no sense of style, Dawn.

428
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,678
It's terrible.

429
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,988
Well, shit.

430
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,719
What the hell am I supposed to do now?

431
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,356
You're gonna need
my interior design services, as well.

432
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,274
But like everything else,
they don't come cheap. Another 75k.

433
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,350
Fine. Let's start upstairs.

434
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,159
All right, any reference to the
Confederate flag, country music

435
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,196
or NASCAR
need to be burned immediately.

436
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,316
Can't I keep the Dale Earnhardt shrine
in my bedroom?

437
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,470
- I'm telling you, I think it really works.
- No.

438
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,118
Yes, you have to see it.

439
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,191
Christian, open your mind.

440
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,790
And the portrait is a limited edition.

441
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,510
I had it picked out myself and framed
in a fabulous gold. You'll see...

442
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,832
This isn't what it looks like, Dawn.
I mean, I swear.

443
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,480
I just wanted to try out
my new titties, Momma.

444
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,356
Well, isn't this rich? Even richer than me.

445
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,119
So your son has been kidnapped?

446
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,270
He moved out under his own will,
Mr. Staubeck.

447
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,873
I'm not sure it can be called a kidnapping.

448
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,032
Well, don't be so quick to make
that assumption, Dr. McNamara.

449
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,396
Matt has been robbed of his ability
to think critically.

450
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,469
So? What do we do?

451
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,715
We kidnap him back.

452
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,791
Wait a second.
What if something goes wrong?

453
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,950
That's why Dr. McNamara called me.

454
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,554
I insure that nothing goes wrong.

455
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,110
Look, gentlemen, I am the best
that your money can buy.

456
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,634
But I won't deny
that there are risks involved.

457
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,190
If by some small chance
the deprogramming fails,

458
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,796
the rift between Matt and you,
his family, will widen.

459
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,555
It can't get wider than it already is.

460
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,274
How much?

461
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,869
Matt, please call me back.

462
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,509
If you don't want to talk to your father,
call my cell instead of the house.

463
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,477
I understand.

464
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,633
After what he did, I don't want
to talk to him either. I love you.

465
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,635
I'll get him back, Julia. I promise.

466
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,429
Christian and I have hired someone
to help us. Everything's gonna be all right.

467
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,112
You've hired someone?

468
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,760
A professional who specializes
in extricating people...

469
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,070
And you're telling me this now?

470
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,996
We're not a family, Sean.

471
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,039
A family makes decisions together.
I mean, first it was the Porsche, and...

472
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,838
I told you I wanted to get Matt a car.

473
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,151
And you conveniently left out
the $100,000 price tag.

474
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,516
Okay, I admit, that was wrong.
I was worried about your reaction.

475
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,558
But we're running out of time, Julia.
So fine, make me the bad guy.

476
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,914
You don't want him
with these people either,

477
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,797
but all you're offering is passivity!

478
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,190
What I'm offering is communication,
but because of what you've done,

479
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,872
you've made that all but impossible.

480
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,077
God damn it, these people are powerful
and they have resources we don't.

481
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,832
I'll spend every last penny I have to.

482
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,230
Oh, well, then this should help. Hock it.

483
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,992
I'm not the enemy, Julia!

484
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,150
Okay. Yeah, I'll see you all later.
See you. Bye.

485
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,158
Matt, wait a minute. I wanna talk, Matt.

486
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,159
Wait a minute. I wanna talk to you.

487
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,279
Everything's spun out of control, Dr. Troy.
Can I come in?

488
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,836
Wow, this is nice.

489
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,115
The black thing's a little gay, but...

490
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,395
What are you doing here, Dawn?

491
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,751
It's lonely at The Ritz, Dr. Troy.

492
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,949
I usually make friends with the ladies
who do my nails,

493
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,077
but I can't understand a word
those Cuban gals are saying.

494
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,478
Well, I'm getting a drink.

495
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,996
Great. Make it two.
I'll have a white wine spritzer.

496
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,752
That's classy, right?

497
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,839
You know, his whole life, Dwight
did nothing but sit around the house

498
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,672
and pick corn from his teeth.

499
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,036
The man's a simpleton,
but he worshipped me.

500
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,556
I can't believe he did this to me.

501
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,713
You know, Mallory I understand. I mean,
Dwight's so hunky, he's hard to resist.

502
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,952
But the whole thing
makes me feel so worthless.

503
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,437
So dump him.
There are plenty of other guys.

504
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,590
Who will love me for my money.

505
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,274
That idiot fell for me
when we both had nothing.

506
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,590
And I know he still loves me.

507
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,233
Dawn.

508
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,029
Dawn.

509
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,508
What are you doing, Dawn?

510
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,718
I want to buy one more thing, Dr. Troy.
A night with you.

511
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,588
I need Dwight to know he can't do
what he did without consequences.

512
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,319
Basically, I want a revenge screw.

513
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,994
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

514
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,399
You need to take a deep breath.

515
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,789
I will pay you $100,000.

516
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,189
I wouldn't sit on the same toilet seat
as you for 100 grand.

517
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,635
Name your price, sexy man.

518
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,634
400,000 bucks gets you 10 minutes.

519
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,519
Strictly missionary, nothing kinky.

520
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,593
I'll throw in an extra 20
if we can do it on the rug.

521
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,508
Your ass is really brown.
What is that, Mystic spray-on tan?

522
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,111
Are you all the way in?

523
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,954
I am so worried about Britney and K-Fed.

524
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,033
He's just like Dwight, overwhelmed
by the sudden glamour and wealth.

525
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,839
Zip it, Dawn, or it'll be another 100k.

526
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,915
You got any mac and cheese?

527
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,194
Zip it, Dawn.

528
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,271
- Because I could make...
- Zip it.

529
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,709
I thought it would be more fulfilling.
Something out of a movie.

530
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,758
Fireworks, flowers.

531
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,913
Frankly, I only did it so Dwight
would get jealous and wise up.

532
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,320
Right now, I feel worse than I did before.

533
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,236
That's because deep inside
you know you're responsible

534
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,596
for driving your husband
and your daughter into bed together.

535
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,272
I'm responsible?

536
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,920
I gave those two every goddamn thing
they ever wanted.

537
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,118
You buy them everything you want.
You're a mean and selfish bitch, Dawn.

538
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,431
And no money in the world
is gonna change that.

539
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,636
Then why'd you help me
with my clothes, my look?

540
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,119
Why'd you have sex with me?

541
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,510
Because I needed the money

542
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,114
for somebody I think I'm in love with.

543
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,198
Well, take it from me, Doc,
money can't buy you love.

544
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,398
Thinner thighs, absolutely.

545
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,759
As soon as the kids are asleep, I'll leave.

546
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,717
I got a room at the Marriott
until I find a place.

547
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,109
Oh, please don't do that.

548
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,000
This has been hard for both of us, Sean.

549
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,680
Now, I'm not saying that
what you did wasn't wrong,

550
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,992
it's just that I've been so busy
worrying about Conor and Annie,

551
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,516
and you at least tried
to do something about Matt.

552
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,636
I should have acknowledged that.

553
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,759
What I'm trying to say
is neither of us can do this alone.

554
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,755
Only you and I can save our family.
Not money or cars or deprogrammers.

555
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,909
And our family needs us together.

556
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,791
That's my old wedding ring.

557
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,155
I found it with your cufflinks.

558
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,950
Will you marry me, Sean McNamara?

559
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,153
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

560
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,513
There you go. $400,000.

561
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,351
I thought you didn't know how
you were gonna dig up such a lofty sum.

562
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,953
Where I got it doesn't matter.

563
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,349
What matters is that
once I get all the photos

564
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,238
and the negatives, you're a ghost.

565
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,872
That's a shame.

566
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,632
We have such great chemistry.

567
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,313
I envy you.

568
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,188
The only true joy in life is being in love
and have those feelings reciprocated.

569
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,348
I hope it works out for you. Both of you.

570
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,032
How could you be so careless?
I taught you better than this, Michelle.

571
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,908
Never leave a trail.
This last slip-up is positively slug-like.

572
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,037
Get out of my goddamn car
and out of my life.

573
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,870
I'm tired of your threats.

574
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,716
You're right. I should take it up
with Christian. Blackmail him.

575
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,153
Of course, he's such a strong personality,

576
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,310
he'll probably go straight to your husband
and confess all.

577
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,834
Cut me off at the pass.
You know how men are.

578
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,388
What do you want? More money?

579
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,758
I don't want money.

580
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,919
I want your skills.

581
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,878
No. I won't do that anymore.

582
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,479
Think hard before you turn me down.

583
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,159
Please. You told me
I'd never have to do that again.

584
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,391
I'm short on girls.

585
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,828
You're the best.

586
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,509
I'm sorry.

587
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,518
Hi, this is Michelle.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

588
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,791
Is this seat taken?

589
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,552
And now we'll have the exchange of rings.

590
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,719
"Dear Dawn,
Mallory and I moved back to Pensacola.

591
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,473
"You were more fun poor. "

592
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,917
With the authority vested in me
by the State of Florida,

593
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,312
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

594
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,872
Steady, girl.

595
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,509
English
