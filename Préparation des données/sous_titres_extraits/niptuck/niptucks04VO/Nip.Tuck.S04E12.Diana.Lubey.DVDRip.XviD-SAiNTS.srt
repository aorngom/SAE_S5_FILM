1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,315
Previously on Nip / Tuck...

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,594
What are you doing in my house?

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,671
I just came by to get rid of some evidence.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,990
I've been plotting this operation
for months.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,150
I'm a diagnosed sexual compulsive.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,118
I thought I had it under control,
but clearly I don't.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,031
- How's it look?
- I think he'll like it.

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,599
He knows who you are, James.

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,716
If we take his kidney,
he'll know it was you.

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,552
It's harvest time, darling.

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,597
And I am under a lot of pressure.

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,954
I can get us out of this.

13
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,918
We just don't belong together anymore.

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,599
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself, Mrs. Luby.

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,113
Lubey. It's French.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,911
Nip/tuck vacations
are very popular these days,

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,309
particularly with the Euro's strength
against the dollar.

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,790
- Did you come to us by way of Paris?
- Paris has too many tourists.

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,429
I've lived in New York most of my life,
Miami the last 15 years.

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,950
Where do you hide all your ashtrays?

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,953
Actually, we don't allow smoking
in the building.

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,279
In any case,
what can we do for you, Mrs. Lubey?

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,873
Not enough, it seems.

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,918
I'm here for my breasts.

25
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,832
If I may say,
they look quite spectacular as they are.

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,150
- Saline or silicone?
- Saline.

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,834
My Victor put them in
almost five years ago.

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,710
Victor was your previous surgeon?

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,278
Victor was my late husband.
He passed two months ago.

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,070
- I'm very sorry to hear that.
- Are you?

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,109
Could you know what it's like

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,795
to lose the one true love of your life
after 20 years of marriage?

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,155
Yes, I can.

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,079
So, what can we do
with your breasts, Mrs. Lubey?

35
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,991
Are you sleeping at all yet?

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,712
The nights are the worst.

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,794
It's hard to accept that he's really gone,
isn't it?

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,113
He's not really gone.

39
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,995
I carry him with me everywhere I go,

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,917
although it's getting harder and harder
to find the right handbag to carry him in.

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,191
- Is that...
- My Victor, yes.

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,078
I'm here because I would like you
to place his ashes into my breasts.

43
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,995
Sorry?

44
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,548
You dilute his ashes in a saline solution,

45
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,594
then replace my current implants
with those.

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,110
The procedure's unique, yes, I know,
but it's been done before.

47
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,111
Why would you want to do that?

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,914
When Victor and I
used to lie in bed together,

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,434
he would put his head here and fall asleep.

50
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,152
Said it gave him comfort.

51
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,389
I couldn't save him from cancer,

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,950
but at least I can give him
the restful place he's always wanted.

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,999
And just knowing he's there,
closer to my heart, would relieve my grief.

54
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,396
- It's a little...
- Romantic.

55
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,314
It's very romantic.

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,118
I was gonna say
"out of touch with reality. "

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,237
Well, the reality is,
these days people have all kinds of options

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,390
when it comes to cremated remains.

59
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,517
There are companies
that will place ashes into coral reefs,

60
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,079
shoot them into space.

61
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,232
With the proper sealant,
I see no problem with your request.

62
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,073
- You have no problem with this?
- Please, Doctors.

63
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,472
There was no greater joy than when Victor
was inside of me when he was alive.

64
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,118
Don't deny me that pleasure anymore.
Please.

65
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,112
God, I feel like
I've just been let out of a chain gang.

66
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,075
No more sneaking around,
nobody telling us what to do.

67
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,593
We're free, baby.

68
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,397
You think it's appropriate for you two
to be groping in the office?

69
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,234
Michelle just got back today, Sean.
You could be a little nicer.

70
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,478
Linda just told me
that we're passing on Diana Lubey.

71
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,917
When I told her
that you and I hadn't consulted on it yet,

72
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,958
she said that didn't matter because
you and the boss here already had.

73
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,519
Jesus, Sean, that chick's a whack job.

74
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,114
I usually have to convince you
to take those cases.

75
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,351
Ms. Lubey has just suffered
a debilitating loss.

76
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,880
If the procedure is medically sound,

77
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,032
it's our obligation as doctors
to help relieve her pain.

78
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,673
I thought you of all people would
understand what she's going through.

79
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,638
I scattered my husband's ashes
along Mount Bonnell.

80
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,156
I didn't have them placed into my body.

81
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,151
I appreciate Mrs. Lubey's suffering,

82
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,153
but I'm not risking a spike
in our malpractice insurance to alleviate it.

83
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,519
So interesting
when the hooker becomes the pimp.

84
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,594
I'd hardly say
you were in a position to throw stones,

85
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,114
considering I came back to a crime scene.

86
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,472
How could you operate
on a convicted murderer?

87
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,356
Even people in prison
are entitled to medical care.

88
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,875
This was a request
by the Florida Department of Corrections,

89
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,918
and you weren't here
to turn down that request, boss.

90
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,836
And now he's still at large,
and I'm up to my ass in affidavits.

91
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,672
Let me be clear.

92
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,272
Landau Industries
owns 51% of this practice,

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,993
and according to Burt's will,
Landau Industries is now 100% me.

94
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,235
I don't expect
to ever have to explain my decisions

95
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,390
about what is best for my company.

96
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,350
Do you realize what it's gonna take
for me to clean up that mess?

97
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,668
I need to protect my standing.

98
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,228
Bullshit. This is about Julia leaving you.

99
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,552
Don't take your pain out on us
just because we're happy.

100
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,358
You're right. I'm sorry.
Tell Michelle I'm sorry, too.

101
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,396
You need to go see somebody, Sean.

102
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,278
A shrink, an acupuncturist,
a hooker, whatever.

103
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,591
You don't, it'll tear you apart.

104
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,230
I should've stood up for you better.

105
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,278
Forget it, Christian. I have.

106
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,233
Sean's not himself.

107
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,950
Think about what he's going through.

108
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,679
His wife left him, took the kids with her.

109
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,910
He must feel so completely alone.

110
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,038
- What?
- You're amazing.

111
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,473
You're just so beautiful, inside and out.

112
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,837
I don't think there's anything
you could say or do, anything,

113
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,992
that could change
the way I feel about you.

114
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,993
I love you, Michelle.

115
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,469
To you.

116
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,628
Is there something
in your champagne glass?

117
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,634
- Oh, my God.
- Will you marry me?

118
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,314
Was that a yes?

119
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,633
I want to say yes,

120
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,190
but you really don't know
what you're getting yourself into.

121
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,278
You've never been married.

122
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,029
I think we need to live together first.

123
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,353
That makes some sense.

124
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,193
Why don't you call Irma, get her
to pack your stuff and bring it over here

125
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,748
so you never have to leave here
ever again?

126
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,475
That's the thing.
I feel strange about this place,

127
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,039
knowing all the women
that have slept in that bed.

128
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,115
We need to find our own place,
with no memories, no ghosts.

129
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,108
But the first step is definitely
putting this apartment on the market.

130
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,515
Thank you again for seeing me
on such short notice.

131
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,272
No, I'm flattered you called.

132
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,477
- Who in your office recommended me?
- Linda, one of our nurses.

133
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,675
She mentioned that you came in

134
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,149
for a tattoo removal
with my partner last month?

135
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,355
That's right.

136
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,591
Dr. Troy, was it? Yeah.

137
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,479
He doesn't know I'm here,

138
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,553
but he is the one who suggested
that I talk to somebody.

139
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,033
And why's that?

140
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,955
Your wife of 18 years leaves.

141
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,274
I guess that's reason enough right there.

142
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,232
And I tend not to be
too open with my feelings.

143
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,437
I let things build up

144
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,910
and then I explode.

145
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,472
Like at work the other day.

146
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,234
What happened?

147
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,630
Christian... Dr. Troy and I had an argument
about taking on a surgery,

148
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,710
and he sided with his girlfriend,

149
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,719
so I attacked her.

150
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,076
It was nasty and untoward,
and frankly, I feel like a shitheel.

151
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,517
Girlfriend? I don't understand.
What was she doing at the office?

152
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,996
She actually owns the business.

153
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,515
The point is, I overreacted.

154
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,511
They didn't want to take on the case.

155
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,353
Well, sounds to me like
they were out of line, Sean, not you.

156
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,113
You lost your wife.

157
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,236
You're dealing with
what any psychologist will tell you

158
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,197
is the equivalent of a death.

159
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,152
Ganging up on you
when you're in such a vulnerable state,

160
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,958
well, it's unconscionable.

161
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,715
What's this girlfriend's name?

162
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,234
Michelle.

163
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,357
Are you uncomfortable
with the fact that your partner,

164
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,954
the one stable person
in your life right now,

165
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,275
is having a sexual relationship
with someone who's also your boss?

166
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,437
Are you feeling excluded? Shut out?

167
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,593
I do feel shut out.

168
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,114
I guess I'm just worried that...

169
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,270
That you'll get dumped yet again?

170
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,032
What am I supposed to do?

171
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,830
She's our boss. I can't fire her.

172
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,999
I can't just ask Christian
to dump her for me.

173
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,957
Well, you don't have to let either of them
step over you.

174
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,033
And part of your emotional recovery
needs to be you reclaiming your power.

175
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,673
Now, if that surgery
was something you felt strongly about,

176
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,035
call that patient back. Bring them in.

177
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,909
Your wife recently acted out
in a way that made you feel powerless.

178
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,358
Don't let your partner
put you in that same kind of position.

179
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,838
Happiness becomes you, darling.
You look positively ebullient.

180
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,356
We have nothing to say to each other
anymore, James. Get out.

181
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,352
You wound me to the bone.

182
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,392
Is it too much to expect to get
a little gratitude after all I've done for you?

183
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,469
You mean, to me?

184
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,358
You expect me to thank you for
all the torture you've put me through?

185
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,749
Dues, darling. We all have to pay them.

186
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,909
You're a rich woman now, aren't you?

187
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,833
- Because of me.
- He's dead, James.

188
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,436
- It's over.
- Is it?

189
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,919
Money can buy a great deal.

190
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,109
The silence of the coroner,

191
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,351
the efficient dispersal
of your husband's mutilated body.

192
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,193
But it can't erase the past completely,
now, can it?

193
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,636
Well, not while I'm around, anyway.

194
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,150
I have a modest proposal for you.

195
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,756
I simply need the use of McNamara/Troy
three nights a week after hours.

196
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,832
No one need know about it.
We're very tidy.

197
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,275
I won't involve them
in your business anymore.

198
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,112
I won't involve him.

199
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,598
- Christian?
- For the first time in my life, I'm in love.

200
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,793
First time?

201
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,598
We're getting married.

202
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,158
Well, congratulations.

203
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,880
I imagine after a year
of coaxing a fossilized phallus,

204
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,996
your cravings for something youthful
and hard needed to be satisfied.

205
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,638
Just leave!

206
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,672
I lack the ability
to truly get inside you, darling,

207
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,953
but don't let your appetites
get the better of your judgment.

208
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,998
As I recall,
you were always a malleable little mouse

209
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,479
after an orgasm.

210
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,352
Be careful, pet.

211
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,348
A mouse may get to roar
once in a lifetime,

212
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,113
but at the end, it's still a mouse.

213
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,077
I doubt your husband-to-be
would relish the thought

214
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,752
of his wife being a murderer.

215
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,832
I have a list of every girl in your employ

216
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,792
and every victim in every state
you've ever drugged and cut open.

217
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,278
Go ahead, James,
shout it from the rooftops.

218
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,551
You can't threaten me anymore.

219
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,198
'Cause if I'm going down,
you're coming with me.

220
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,832
Count backwards from 10 for me,
Ms. Lubey.

221
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,195
One moment.

222
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,236
Would it be possible
to have one last drag?

223
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,880
You know, just in case
I join my Victor on the other side?

224
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,949
Excuse me?

225
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,190
Well, you know, a cigarette. Just a puff.

226
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,511
Oh, no. No, no.
Don't worry, I'm not gonna lose you.

227
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,398
Americans never had
any glamour or romance.

228
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,558
And I don't know...

229
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,754
How we doing?

230
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,834
I think these implants
are contaminated, Sean.

231
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,990
I mean, what's that gray stuff
floating in the saline?

232
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,594
We're replacing Mrs. Lubey's implants
with these

233
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,319
because they are ashes
sealed inside them.

234
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,675
They're sterile. It's completely safe.

235
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,354
Wow. Frenchie really does
like her cigarettes.

236
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,079
They're the ashes
of her deceased husband, Liz.

237
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,189
This way, they'll never be apart.

238
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,509
10-blade.

239
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,757
What the hell is she doing on the table?

240
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,434
Michelle and I told you
we weren't gonna do this operation.

241
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,512
For 10 years we've made
our surgical decisions together, Christian.

242
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,751
I'm not suddenly gonna let an outside
non-medical professional like Michelle

243
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,229
tell me who I can and cannot operate on.

244
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,000
Now either scrub up and assist me
or get out.

245
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,749
Look, if this means that much to you,

246
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,753
if this helps you with your feelings
about Julia or something, fine.

247
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,115
I'll explain your actions to Michelle.

248
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,995
But if you care about me at all, Sean,

249
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,071
you're gonna have to give her
some respect.

250
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,718
I know she's your girlfriend, Christian.

251
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,392
Actually, she's gonna be more than that.

252
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,993
She's gonna be my wife.

253
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,310
I can't believe his insensitivity.

254
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,631
Now he's getting married.

255
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,958
- Married? When did that happen?
- He told me about it yesterday.

256
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,517
And the thing is, I can't stand her.
She's opportunistic,

257
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,157
taking control of the business,
our business that we built together, and...

258
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,514
And what?

259
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,430
And she's taking him away from me.

260
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,953
Now, when I really need him.

261
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,069
Jesus, you'd think we were gay.

262
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,111
I certainly wouldn't think you were.

263
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,876
- Excuse me?
- Oh, nothing.

264
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,108
- Forget I said anything.
- What did you mean?

265
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,397
I just think you might be internalizing
some of Christian's projections.

266
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,595
What?

267
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,557
I've known him since college.

268
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,753
I mean, Christian gets more ass
than anyone in South Florida, okay?

269
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,957
If there's one man who's not gay,
it's Christian Troy.

270
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,316
Okay, look, you can't just play
"don't ask, don't tell. "

271
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,834
This is my best friend we're talking about.

272
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,876
If he were gay, I think I'd know about it.

273
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,555
And you've never sensed any of
his ambivalent feelings towards you?

274
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,438
- Look, you don't know him.
- Christian was a patient of mine.

275
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,188
It was his homosexual feelings for you
that brought him here.

276
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,237
Look, I have already overstepped
all sorts of professional boundaries,

277
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,278
but I cannot sit here
and watch your confusion.

278
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,389
My God.

279
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,957
There was a period of time.

280
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,436
I mean, he was acting so strangely.
It's like he wanted to avoid me or...

281
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,635
And now,

282
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,789
the one time that you are
alone and available,

283
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,079
suddenly he's not?

284
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,671
He's so afraid that he might actually
act on his feelings for you,

285
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,118
he's attached himself to a woman
who's cheated on him.

286
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,357
I can get into a lot of trouble
for revealing this, Sean.

287
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,278
Should I say something?

288
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,829
- I'm not...
- I can't tell you what to do.

289
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,637
That would be unprofessional.

290
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,750
I'm gonna go catch a movie
or get something to eat or something.

291
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,589
But don't get too full.

292
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,830
I really think you're gonna have
multiple offers to digest

293
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,876
when you come home.

294
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,919
Christian, hey!

295
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,833
I'm not too early, am I?
I wanted to be first in line.

296
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,831
Your open house is today, right?

297
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,559
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come in.

298
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,629
All right.

299
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,989
Yeah, I've been looking for a new condo.

300
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,077
When my realtor told me
Christian Troy's place was available,

301
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,072
I thought, "Damn, I have to see
what the view is like from the top. "

302
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,878
Would you like to sign in?

303
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,433
Would you give me the tour?

304
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,795
I'd really like King Arthur
to show me his castle.

305
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,758
Sure, sure. He's a friend of mine. Come on.

306
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,909
All right.

307
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,835
Here's the bed.

308
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,388
Back here's the bathroom.
It's pretty standard.

309
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,438
I had this shower custom-built
when I first moved in.

310
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,154
Wow.

311
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,994
You can still hear the screams
from the women you banged in here.

312
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,319
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there've been a few.

313
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,515
A few?

314
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,636
More like a few thousand, right?

315
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,352
Hope those walls are thick.

316
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,394
Oh, and if these walls could talk,

317
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,671
they'd tell you you're not ready
to get married, Christian.

318
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,598
You're not ready to give up all of this.

319
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,798
You've never been a one-woman guy,
have you?

320
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,558
Not even with me.

321
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,591
Go ahead, marry Michelle,

322
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,556
but you're just gonna cheat on her.

323
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,548
You're gonna screw it up
like you always do.

324
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,118
Your fate's inevitable.

325
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,277
Built-in closets back there.
And that's pretty much it.

326
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,314
The view's what sold me in the first place.

327
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,078
On a clear day, you could probably
see the Bahamas from here.

328
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,913
You wanna know what I saw,
even though I'm blind?

329
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,840
You weren't ready
for a serious relationship.

330
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,391
We could've been married by now,

331
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,792
but you were too afraid
of real intimacy, weren't you?

332
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,358
And you still are. I can feel it.

333
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,154
- You okay, bro?
- Yeah.

334
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,673
I'm fine.

335
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,357
That's the living room,
the dining room, kitchen.

336
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,829
- That's where all women belong.
- Nice!

337
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,832
Barefoot and pregnant
and cooking dinner for their man.

338
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,148
Does it come with all the appliances?

339
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,071
And a place for recyclables.

340
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,358
Because that's all women really are
to you, isn't it?

341
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,479
Something to use, discard and recycle.

342
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,839
Yes, it comes with all the appliances.

343
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,269
Sold.

344
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,753
- It's my romantic surgeon.
- Hello, Mrs. Lubey.

345
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,836
How's your pain level?

346
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,239
Are we keeping you comfortable?

347
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,673
Very comfortable.

348
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,069
And I'm very grateful to you,
Dr. McNamara.

349
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,879
I know your partner
was against the surgery,

350
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,670
but you saw the poetry in my situation.
You believed.

351
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,439
What's her name?

352
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,989
Julia.

353
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,629
Julia.

354
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,438
You know what I think?

355
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,030
I think you'll fall in love again.

356
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,268
I won't.

357
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,238
You're too young and too handsome
to be so cynical.

358
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,599
What are you thinking?

359
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,675
I try to imagine my life from here on,

360
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,357
how that one woman who would have
carried my ashes inside her is gone.

361
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,708
Gone for good.

362
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,635
I admire your devotion, even in death.

363
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,031
Where are my goddamn ashes?

364
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,872
Excuse me,
we're in the middle of an exam.

365
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,188
Well, look at you, Diana.

366
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,114
Having some plastic surgery
so you will attract your next man?

367
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,428
You are so predictable.

368
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,318
- What are you doing here?
- You know what I'm doing here.

369
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,311
When Victor's ashes
disappeared from the urn,

370
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,951
I hired a detective, and the trail
brought me right here to this room, Diana.

371
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,112
He loved me. He didn't love you.
He was just afraid of you.

372
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,315
You need to leave.

373
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,312
Oh, you
with your phony, cigarette-smoking,

374
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,834
oh-so-French line of bullshit.

375
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,959
You had him fooled, but not me.

376
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,110
- Not me, Diana.
- Who is this woman?

377
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,111
I am Mrs. Victor Madsen,

378
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,399
and if you will kindly ask your patient
to tell me where my husband's ashes are,

379
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,753
I will leave her to her new boob job.

380
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,440
- Everything all right?
- Fine.

381
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,278
Wanna get me a drink?

382
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,515
I owe you an apology about Diana Lubey.

383
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,032
She wasn't Victor Madsen's wife,
she was his mistress.

384
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,395
We're under court order

385
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,392
to remove the implants
and return the remains to his wife.

386
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,550
I told you that bird was a loony.

387
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,832
She's not a loony, she's just lonely.

388
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,558
We all do crazy things
to stave off the loneliness.

389
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,475
That's kind of why I'm here, actually.

390
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,994
You think I'm being crazy,
getting married?

391
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,191
You're having second thoughts?

392
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,037
Not about Michelle, about me.

393
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,118
I've never been able
to commit to one woman before.

394
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,471
What makes me think I can now?

395
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,517
- You can just tell me, Christian.
- Tell you what, Sean?

396
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,153
I guess I should have known,
considering your affection for Julia.

397
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,953
I must have been too blinded by jealousy
to see the big picture.

398
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,077
No, this has nothing to do with Julia.

399
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,751
This is about me and Michelle.

400
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,230
No, you're talking about you and me.

401
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,159
I know you have feelings for me.

402
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,235
I mean, romantic feelings.

403
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,473
It's typical for children of abuse

404
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,235
to have trouble dealing
with their sexual identity in a healthy way.

405
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,030
What are you saying? Are you saying...
You think I'm...

406
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,269
You said it yourself, Christian.

407
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,318
You've never been able
to commit to a woman. Not one.

408
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,431
And yet, no matter
how many times I've tried running away,

409
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,670
you've found a way
to keep our relationship together.

410
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,150
- That's because we're best friends.
- No, we're more than that.

411
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,315
We're brothers.

412
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,392
Which is why none of this changes
how I feel about you.

413
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,590
I love you, Christian. I always will.

414
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,633
But not like that.

415
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,238
Have I been doing something lately?
Walking weird or something?

416
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,719
Is it my eyebrows?

417
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,838
Because I tell you, if I don't wax,

418
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,515
then I get this whole unibrow thing,
and it just... It looks ugly.

419
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,239
But just because I groom
doesn't mean I've gone Brokeback.

420
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,073
Don't make excuses. I'm not judging.
It's okay.

421
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,913
No, it's not okay, because it's not true.

422
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,550
Who told you this bullshit, anyway?

423
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,240
You remember when you told me
to talk to someone?

424
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,836
Hey, Doc. Remember me?

425
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,231
It's nice to see you, Christian.

426
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,958
Maybe we should set a time
where we can talk

427
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,349
when I don't have patients waiting.

428
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,195
Don't worry, I told them
you were about to lose your license.

429
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,197
- They're gone.
- You did what?

430
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,033
Did you really think
telling my partner all those lies

431
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,712
wasn't gonna get back to me?

432
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,788
I'm sorry. Telling who what lies?

433
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,031
Sean told me
about your little session the other day.

434
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,751
All that shit about me being gay?

435
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,194
Christian, even if Sean was a client,
which I can neither confirm nor deny,

436
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,670
what makes you think I would share
the details of our session with him?

437
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,273
That's for you to do.

438
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,679
Although I do hope that you shared
your conflict with your fiancée.

439
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,075
Dr. Wolper.

440
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,549
I see.

441
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,718
- Well, I guess I owe you an apology.
- You're damn right, you do.

442
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,518
I meant to you, Sean.

443
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,390
It was completely unprofessional,
my revealing what I did about Christian.

444
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,150
I put you in a terrible position,
and I'm sorry.

445
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,958
I know.
I tried to explain that to Christian...

446
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,712
Hold on, Sean.

447
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,429
It's one thing to slip up.
It's another to lie about what I said.

448
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,757
So you're denying
that you ever had feelings for Sean?

449
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,355
I never said I was gay, and I never said
I wanted a relationship with him.

450
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,396
I never said those words.

451
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,040
Oh, Christian, when people come to me,

452
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,159
they do so because they don't
have the words to express how they feel.

453
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,119
It's my job to map out those emotions,
to interpret their desires.

454
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,394
Desires?

455
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,472
Well, the dream that you had
where you and Sean were lovers?

456
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,469
You didn't tell me about a dream.

457
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,471
You're not still buying into her crap,
are you?

458
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,118
Well, if it's not true, why are you so upset?

459
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,792
Look, you have enough to deal with
in your life

460
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,189
without taking advice
from some psychotic.

461
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,239
Sean, would you excuse Christian and me?
I think I could calm him down.

462
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,594
No, no, no.

463
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,197
Since we're spilling secrets,

464
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,352
did you tell Sean about your tattoo?

465
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,314
Two wrongs won't make a right, Christian.

466
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,116
Dr. Faith Wolper
is a sexual compulsive, Sean.

467
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,436
After I nailed her in this office
and then removed her tattoo,

468
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,149
which said, "Property of Marco,"
she thought I had the hots for her.

469
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,674
Didn't you, Doc?

470
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,869
You're lying.

471
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,714
If you wanted me to bend you over
the desk again, why didn't you just ask?

472
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,030
Why'd you have to involve my partner?

473
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,592
Unless, of course, you wanna do us both.

474
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,595
Stop.

475
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,355
Hey.

476
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,193
No, let me show you
what she's really about, Sean.

477
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,274
Jesus.

478
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,358
I hope you didn't pay for any sessions
in advance.

479
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,918
I thought I smelled brimstone.

480
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,434
Why don't you get back
on your broomstick?

481
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,109
Holy shit.

482
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,995
What happened?

483
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,878
I was given an incentive
to increase profits.

484
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,469
Apparently I've fallen below
management's projections this quarter.

485
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,119
I'm sorry.

486
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,834
Michelle didn't tell me
her pimp had a pimp.

487
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,636
Well, we all eventually
have to face a higher power.

488
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,789
Some are a bit more brutal than others.

489
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,195
You've definitely fractured
your cheekbone.

490
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,191
Your eye looks unscathed.

491
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,239
You might want a little rhinoplasty

492
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,039
to raise that patrician nose of yours
back in the air.

493
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,633
Please do it for me.

494
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,873
Ask your boss for a name.
I'm sure he has a list.

495
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,276
I trust you, Christian.

496
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,550
Wish I felt the same, sweetheart.

497
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,598
Sorry, but even a squashed spider
spins its web until its final breath.

498
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,235
I am begging you.

499
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,550
There's nowhere else I can turn to.

500
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,914
I have no one. Nothing.

501
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,873
At least just leave me my vanity.

502
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,513
Hey, Gustav, can you send me up
the Lonely Boy Special?

503
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,635
Yeah, wild salmon and the house salad.
Thanks.

504
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,151
Your appetizer's plated
and ready for you, sweetheart.

505
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,033
Did we have a date?

506
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,032
No, I had a fantasy.

507
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,718
I wanted to be the last person
you made love to on this bed.

508
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,073
I guess it was a bad call.

509
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,832
No, no, no, I just...

510
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,717
I just had a rough day, and I'm beat.

511
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,713
Why was it such a hard day, sweetheart?

512
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,877
Well, I had a disagreement of sorts
with Sean,

513
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,111
and then when I got back to the office,
our friend the vampire was there.

514
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,315
James?

515
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,398
Her pimp had given her the once-over,

516
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,994
which took me three hours of surgery
to fix.

517
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,397
How could you do that in my business?

518
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,313
That's what I do. I'm a doctor, remember?
I fix people.

519
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,393
Operating on James without talking
to me first was a betrayal, Christian,

520
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,515
no matter how you spin it.

521
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,558
The woman's alone in the world.
Don't you remember what that's like?

522
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,710
- Jesus, Michelle.
- Give me a break.

523
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,157
Since when are you so sentimental
towards lonely women?

524
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,200
Are you looking for a way
out of marrying me?

525
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,639
'Cause that's what this feels like,
sabotage.

526
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,109
Clever boy.

527
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,431
Make her angry so she'll be the one
to leave. It's always worked before.

528
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,638
- That is bullshit.
- No, it's not. I can't trust you.

529
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,188
Isn't that what marriage is all about,
honesty and trust?

530
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,716
This is your opportunity to bail, Christian.
Seize it.

531
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,080
She's handing it to you on a silver platter.

532
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,238
You're right. I suck.

533
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,949
I suck as a friend, I suck as a lover,
I suck as a fiancé.

534
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,911
I'm tired of defending myself.

535
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,797
I'll call the realtor and cancel escrow.

536
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,791
I knew this moment was coming.

537
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,351
I knew once you really had me,
you'd find a way to run.

538
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,351
Just go. Just get out of here.

539
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,399
Honey, I'm gone.

540
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,148
Michelle, wait.

541
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,198
It was only a matter of time, sweetheart.

542
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,953
Hello, darling.

543
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,798
So glad you could make it.

544
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,075
I always thought that playing music
during surgery was a touch baroque.

545
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,037
It really does pep up the joint.

546
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,918
- Who is that on the table?
- Just another customer.

547
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,995
We have been rather messy, haven't we?

548
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,000
Tatiana, you shouldn't be operating
on a frog.

549
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,194
Why don't you come over here
and finish for us?

550
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,759
For old times' sake.

551
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,399
Your husband's ashes.

552
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,234
I used a small hydraulic press
to remove the excess saline solution

553
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,390
and facilitate the drying process.

554
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,830
Your signature authenticating
that Mr. Madsen's remains

555
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,831
is all that remains.

556
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,356
It's hard to believe
that this is all that's left of Victor.

557
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,711
His body, Mrs. Madsen.

558
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,953
I don't know
if you believe in an eternal soul.

559
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,079
Trust me, Doctor,
that's the only thing that keeps me going,

560
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,675
knowing that his soul is roasting in hell
for all eternity.

561
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,753
Now, if these are legally mine,
I'd like to give the bastard a proper burial.

562
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,554
Mrs. Madsen?

563
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,029
You got a goddamn toilet in this place?

564
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,549
I'm gonna flush him down the crapper
like the piece of shit that he is.

565
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,553
Screwing his froggie mistress
for the last 10 years.

566
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,113
You think I didn't know?

567
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,553
Think about what you're doing, Beatrice.

568
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,519
She got everything. Time, attention, love.

569
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,669
All I got were endless lies
and these goddamn spoiled kids.

570
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,593
Well, now she's the one who gets nothing!

571
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,080
There, Victor. You're fish food.

572
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,871
At least now I can sleep

573
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,158
knowing you'll never go
anywhere near that bitch's tits again.

574
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,470
They tell me she made quite a scene.

575
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,673
I'm sorry you had to hear about it.
It must have been very disturbing for you.

576
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,759
He suffered so much
from her cruel unhappiness.

577
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,999
But he wouldn't leave.

578
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,833
He was just like that,
an old-fashioned man.

579
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,079
Divorce was unthinkable.

580
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,913
He couldn't face his children,
his grandchildren.

581
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,117
He loved me,
but I was the one left with nothing.

582
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,593
Not a mention at his funeral,
no closet full of his shirts to sleep in.

583
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,554
So I stole those ashes, and I valued them.

584
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,953
My only crime was loving him too much.

585
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,237
Look at you. You're even more handsome
when you're sad.

586
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,193
- Diana.
- Please, Doctor, it's been days.

587
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,589
Days, has it?

588
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,429
One of my nurses
found this under your bed

589
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,958
filled to the brim with ashes
and cigarette butts.

590
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,675
- Bad girl.
- I know nothing about that.

591
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,349
Well, whoever filled it

592
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,830
provided us with a nice little package
for the grieving widow.

593
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,433
What do you mean?

594
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,671
These are Victor's real ashes.

595
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,477
Why would you do this for me?

596
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,159
All those years
you shared him with others

597
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,437
must have been so difficult,

598
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,159
so lonely.

599
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,275
Your love for Victor is the real deal.

600
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,831
Deserves a nod from someone.

601
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,589
Plus, it helps me believe.

602
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,277
I have nothing to offer.
How can I thank you?

603
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,869
Maybe this.

604
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,713
"Out, damned spot! "

605
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,274
Sorry, just a little joke.

606
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,357
We have orderlies to do that.

607
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,350
We're gonna need to get new ones.

608
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,117
The new health codes
regarding private operating rooms

609
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,191
are considerably more stringent.

610
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,389
One stray drop of blood and we could be
out of business for a week.

611
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,309
Wait.

612
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,396
I'm sorry.
I've been an ass, to Christian and to you.

613
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,477
I understand, Sean. I really do.

614
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,836
Being alone after so long is so hard.

615
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,951
Christian and I have been best friends
for over 20 years.

616
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,550
I've seen him with hundreds of women,

617
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,072
and he's never fallen as hard or as fast
for any of them like he did for you.

618
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,435
You two are the real deal.

619
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,077
Don't let the fact that he's an asshole
get in the way.

620
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,349
But

621
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,477
it isn't just about him, Sean.

622
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,316
- What about my baggage?
- He can handle it.

623
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,597
- But I don't know if I can.
- So use him. Let him help you.

624
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,429
He's strong.

625
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,632
Christian and I are brothers,

626
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,951
which means when you two get married,
we become family.

627
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,989
Trust him, and trust me.

628
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,759
And trust us.

629
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,228
Kitchen's done,

630
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,080
unless you want me to pack
the leftovers in the fridge.

631
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,197
You know what?
The maid's coming tomorrow to finish up.

632
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,714
- I think we're good.
- What about that?

633
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,036
- You guys gonna carry it down together?
- You want the cock?

634
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,112
- I don't want the cock anymore.
- No, I don't want the cock.

635
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,875
You should've asked if I wanted the cock.
I would have said yes.

636
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,278
I'll be downstairs
loading what's left in the car.

637
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,950
You two are getting along better.

638
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,955
Every engagement must go through
a divorce before you get married.

639
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,392
No, I think we're doing really good,
thanks to you.

640
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,719
Actually, I've been wanting to talk to you
since Faith's office.

641
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,958
I lied about what happened in there.

642
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,678
I knew you didn't screw her over the desk.

643
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,675
No, that part's true. I mean
about what she said about the dream.

644
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,360
About me having feelings for you.

645
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,234
Not those kind of feelings.
I never really thought I was gay.

646
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,478
It was Faith
who tried to convince me of that.

647
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,632
I just think I have intimacy issues,
you know?

648
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,314
With anybody in my life that I love.

649
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,038
You know, I get confused, and it's
really hard for me to express myself.

650
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,117
- That sounded really gay, didn't it?
- Yeah.

651
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,758
Yeah. Well, screw you.

652
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,229
Screw you.

653
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,829
Seriously,

654
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,795
I love you.

655
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,558
I know. I love you, too.

656
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,476
And I really think
that you should take the cock.

657
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,199
Yeah, I know. I know you want it.
Come on, come on. Take the cock.

658
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,555
Look, let's go help your fiancée, okay?

659
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,469
You know what? You go ahead.

660
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,473
I'm gonna soak it up for a minute
before I hand over the keys.

661
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,113
Goodbye, ladies.

662
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,118
It's been swell.

663
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,993
Christian.

664
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,509
English
