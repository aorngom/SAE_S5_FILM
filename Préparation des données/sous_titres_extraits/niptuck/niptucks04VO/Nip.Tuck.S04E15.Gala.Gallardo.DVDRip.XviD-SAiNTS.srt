1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,235
Previously on Nip / Tuck...

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,550
Your boss, James, worked for me.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,916
And now that she's gone,
you're gonna take her place.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,879
I told you that if you fix my face,
I set you free as well.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,589
A man is nothing in this world
ifhe doesn't keep his word.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,671
Do you know
that aggressive sex during pregnancy

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,035
can be interpreted by the fetus as abuse?

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,190
I fear for your child's future.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,998
I want you and Michelle to buy me out.

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,718
I don't know who I am without you!

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,711
I need to find that out.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,595
Smudge the air over the couch, honey.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,036
And then cleanse the TV area,

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,271
just in case they watched
one of those dirty cable shows.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,518
- Good point.
- Good point.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,838
- What the hell are they doing?
- Sage-ing the place.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,234
Some kind of feng shui thing, I don't know.

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,798
Burning sage supposedly cleanses the
environment of bad events, bad memories.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,913
Like a divorce.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,793
Or if someone was shot in the head in
the living room, that sort of thing.

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,999
They still paid top dollar, though.
I got exactly what I asked for.

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,197
Yeah, yeah, that's good.
That lighting has got to go.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,759
It's so Pottery Barn in here.

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,273
It is, it is.

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,839
Actually, they're kind of cute.

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,798
They remind me of you and Julia
before the whole...

27
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,394
You know.

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,109
Sorry.

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,957
Hey, you guys
might want to sage the nursery.

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,270
His ex-wife screwed a dwarf in there.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,638
Let's get in there now.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,991
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,675
Nice.

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,395
What the hell are we doing, Sean?

35
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,515
We're packing up all your shit,

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,715
we don't even know
where you're going yet.

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,869
Yes, I do.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,989
Where?

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,070
The plastic surgery capital of the world.

40
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,673
- Brazil?
- Los Angeles.

41
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,399
I have a job interview at a cooperative
next week, they're very interested.

42
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,191
You are so not gonna deal
with not being your own boss.

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,475
If I put up with Michelle
for almost a whole year,

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,993
think I'll be fine.

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,398
- Easy.
- Oh, that reminds me.

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,315
I have your going away present.

47
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,556
It's in the amount you asked for.
You're officially bought out.

48
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,632
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

49
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,749
Great.

50
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,071
But I'm gonna need royalties
on the name, my friend.

51
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,957
Actually, we're gonna change the name.

52
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,032
To Troy/Landau.
Maybe Troy/Troy, after we get married.

53
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,429
You'll be there for the ceremony, right?

54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,596
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

55
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,435
Okay.

56
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,431
So, we'll be back in an hour,
to continue the ceremony.

57
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,555
Why not finish now?

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,198
We tried to sage the master bedroom,

59
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,840
but the handyman said
we were disturbing him.

60
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,954
- I didn't know you had a handyman.
- I don't.

61
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,273
I need you.

62
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,188
Okay, you can take the blindfolds off now.

63
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,558
I really appreciate you guys coming
along like gentleman. Give me.

64
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,629
Yeah, like we had a choice

65
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,359
with the Paul Mitchell twins
pointing guns at our heads.

66
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,908
You know, that really hurts me, Christian.

67
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,868
Now, I gave my word to Sean
after you fixed my face that we were even.

68
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,599
You'll understand if we find that
hard to believe. What is this?

69
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,477
It's a consult. Have a seat.

70
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,752
Okay, say it.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,594
- You know, your line.
- Is this some kind of joke?

72
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,749
Say it!

73
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,072
Tell me
what you don't like about yourself, Ms...

74
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,832
Mrs. Gallardo.

75
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,079
Gala Gallardo.

76
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,869
McNamara, Troy,
I'd like you to meet my wife.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,319
This is bullshit.

78
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,913
Christian. Christian!

79
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,869
You're embarrassing me.

80
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,279
I don't give two shits
about what I'm doing.

81
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,918
You wanna give your wife a free boob job?

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,150
I need reconstructive surgery.

83
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,635
My husband says
that you are the best in Miami, no?

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,119
I like to think so.

85
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,996
Sit down. This won't take long.

86
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,510
I took over my husband's
pharmaceutical business in Cali

87
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,874
while he was in jail.

88
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,157
You know, profits have doubled
since my girl took the reins.

89
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,595
Wow, a female drug lord.

90
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,874
You have a family? Children, yes?

91
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,271
My husband has many enemies.

92
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,591
They want him dead, they want me dead,
they want my children dead.

93
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,559
The only safety in Colombia is money,
mountains of it.

94
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,108
I do what I have to, to protect my family.

95
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,959
Unfortunately, the hatred is so strong
you can't build walls high enough.

96
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,796
There was this girl, Antonia Ramos.
Do you remember her?

97
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,791
One of his double-D drug mules.

98
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,269
She developed an infection
from her implants.

99
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,591
She lost both of her breasts
when she returned to Colombia.

100
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,118
Her brothers couldn't get to him,

101
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,112
so they came for me.

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,551
I was taken from a cafe,
in front of my children, tortured.

103
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,511
I thought they will kill me,

104
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,349
but they just wanted to make me suffer,
like their sister suffered.

105
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,759
You know, every night in prison

106
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,277
I closed my eyes and I dreamed
of my bride's perfect sweater puppies.

107
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,713
Now look at them.

108
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,908
I will not return home to our family,
to our lives,

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,877
until they are perfect again.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,673
Are you currently on medication
for the pain?

111
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,797
Yes, but I lowered the dosage.

112
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,438
I can handle agony.

113
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,075
Two-hundred fifty grand.
That's your fee for the surgery.

114
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,551
I understand
you've been through a lot, Mrs. Gallardo,

115
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,553
but the last time I took
a briefcase full of cash from your husband

116
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,868
I got a BOTOX shot in the dick.

117
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,872
Hey, Christian,
I can't just walk into some doctor's office

118
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,518
and give them
my Blue Cross number, okay?

119
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,113
I had to sneak Gala into the country.

120
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,873
If the Feds knew she was here,
we'd both go to prison.

121
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,518
Why not have the surgery
done in Colombia?

122
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,909
We are too hated there, we trust no one.

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,389
Okay, look.
Please, I'm begging you, as a friend.

124
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,040
Friends don't shoot
their friend's anesthesiologists,

125
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,236
they don't threaten their families.

126
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,118
My wife and I have different ideas
about how to do business.

127
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,031
She thinks you attract more flies
with honey.

128
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,155
Look, the fact is,

129
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,196
as soon as you murdered Alejandro Perez
in my living room

130
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,555
you lost any power you had over us.

131
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,590
We're not getting involved
with you anymore.

132
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,638
How dare you talk to me that way
in front of my wife.

133
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,753
Take them home.

134
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,758
Or haven't you learned it's not good to
make enemies?

135
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,551
Man of your word, huh?

136
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,439
I'm sorry, Mami.

137
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,392
Get me a Diet Coke.

138
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,513
You know, your day job is really
starting to get in the way of my business.

139
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,594
That's Natalie.

140
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,434
You'll be working with her tonight
up in Coral Springs.

141
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,351
Order is for two kidneys.

142
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,356
Call me on this when it's done.

143
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,475
No.

144
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,517
I want you to listen to me.

145
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,559
I'm not as polite as that old British hag
you took orders from before.

146
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,990
You don't get second chances with me.

147
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,708
Kill me. I can't do this anymore, I won't.

148
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,876
- You're just gonna have to kill me.
- You believe this shit?

149
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,673
Look, we had an arrangement. Didn't we?

150
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,274
Med school for four years of service.
There was a trust factor.

151
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,510
Frankly, reneging like this
really calls into question your character.

152
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,828
My character?

153
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,198
I realize as your boss, physically
hurting you only reduces my inventory.

154
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,150
You really wanna pay off your debt?
You wanna do us both a favor?

155
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,309
My wife.

156
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,355
She has this problem with her breasts.

157
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,319
She needs a skilled surgeon
to reconstruct them.

158
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,875
Get your fiancé to do the job.
I swear, I'll consider us even.

159
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,273
He's not cooperating.

160
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,275
Men listen to their women.

161
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,438
Don't I know it, right?

162
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,599
What do you say?

163
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,390
I don't need to involve Christian.

164
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,233
I have a better idea.

165
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,119
I bet you do.

166
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,316
- Don't you dare.
- I can't help it. I miss you already.

167
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,279
When it's all over
we'll have a good cry over margaritas.

168
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,432
In the meantime, let's focus
on making the last one a good one.

169
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,839
10-blade.

170
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,119
- I don't need any assistance, Michelle.
- I'm just here to watch.

171
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,637
This is your last surgery and I wanted
to soak up every last bit of your expertise.

172
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,189
I've normally seen you go in
through the armpit or under the breast?

173
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,590
I prefer going through the original
scars on a mastectomy patient.

174
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,829
There are a lot of adhesions,

175
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,992
it keeps the bleeding down
and the landmarks consistent.

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,151
And why did you choose
not to do the free flap procedure?

177
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,238
When it's a prophylactic mastectomy,
I think the implants are preferable.

178
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,072
Can you step back a little?

179
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,637
Are you planning on inserting the implant
under the muscle, or over it?

180
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,199
What is up with you, Michelle?

181
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,191
You know better
than to disrupt a procedure.

182
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,589
Can I have the implants, please, Linda?

183
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,072
I'm so sorry, Sean.
I guess I am a little over-eager.

184
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,519
I've decided to finish medical school
and do my surgical residency here.

185
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,076
I'm gonna be a plastic surgeon.

186
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,834
What are you doing
with my coffeemaker, Sean?

187
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,831
Since it's one of the few things of mine
in here,

188
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,512
I figured I'd take it with me
to Los Angeles.

189
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,999
Michelle and I bought you out,

190
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,117
which means that we own
everything in this place.

191
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,510
You can take the fishies from your office
if you like,

192
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,352
but the coffeemaker stays.

193
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,392
Cichlids don't travel well, Christian.

194
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,869
I have surgery this afternoon, Sean.
If I don't get my caffeine,

195
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,758
I will fire Linda as soon as she even thinks
about rolling her eyes at me.

196
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,230
Linda is irreplaceable.
There is no McNamara/Troy without her.

197
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,677
And there shouldn't be a Troy/Landau
without her, either.

198
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,990
You're the one I can't replace, Sean.

199
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,595
Well, after Michelle finishes med school,

200
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,797
I'm sure her surgical skills
will complement yours quite well.

201
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,155
And, for once, you'll be the one
with the talent and experience.

202
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,071
Michelle's not going back
to medical school.

203
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,390
That's not what she said in the OR today.

204
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,995
Scrubbed and gloved and asking 20
questions about breast reconstruction.

205
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,150
She seemed like a student already.

206
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,434
She said she was going back
to medical school?

207
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,035
If this is news, Christian, I can only
wonder what else she hasn't told you.

208
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,633
Look, I know you never liked her,

209
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,756
but that doesn't mean
you have to go throwing wrenches around

210
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,909
right when you're leaving, all right?

211
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,399
Michelle and I are fine. Okay?

212
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,994
You just misinterpreted
whatever's happening.

213
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,790
Yeah, I'm sure that's what it was.

214
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,479
Take the freaking coffeemaker,
for Christ's sakes.

215
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,235
Maybe when you become a big
successful Beverly Hills plastic surgeon

216
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,709
it'll remind you of where you came from.

217
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,319
Wilber's out.

218
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,631
Elsa said he fell asleep
the second she put his jammies on.

219
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,078
I don't know how anyone
manages these days without help.

220
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,718
Especially at his age.

221
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,279
What's the matter?

222
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,873
Why didn't you tell me you were thinking
about going back to medical school?

223
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,279
Sean told me.

224
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,636
It's something I've been thinking about.
It isn't definite.

225
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,150
I was gonna talk to you about it.

226
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,958
What other surprises
haven't you told me about?

227
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,029
Nothing.

228
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,518
I'm sorry you feel you can't trust me.

229
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,513
I do, it's just, I don't like hearing
things about you from other people.

230
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,235
You weren't exactly up-front
about your past, and I don't know...

231
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,878
Would you have been if you were me?

232
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,518
We need to be able to be honest
with each other.

233
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,715
I am.

234
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,949
Hello?

235
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,908
Yes, of course.

236
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,633
No, I understand.

237
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,756
I'll be there as soon as I can.

238
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,874
The alarms went off at one of Burt's
office buildings, down on Wilson.

239
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,029
Security's already there,

240
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,749
but they need me to inspect the place
before they file a report.

241
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,349
Would you like to go with me
to make sure I'm telling the truth?

242
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,238
No, I think I'll skip playing detective
right now.

243
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,995
It's much more fun playing
sleep-deprived physician.

244
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,480
- Any trouble getting through?
- Not at all.

245
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,199
Her face was bandaged,
just like you told me.

246
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,238
Good.
We'll give you some general anesthesia,

247
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,596
and the procedure should take
no longer than two hours.

248
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,352
I want them to look natural.

249
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,238
That's why I came to this country
to have it done.

250
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,588
No scars.

251
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,434
- Escobar wouldn't like it.
- I understand.

252
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,716
- How many of these have you done?
- Too many to count.

253
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,519
As I told your husband,
I studied with the best.

254
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,758
Count backwards from 10.

255
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,437
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.

256
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,713
You shouldn't have agreed to this
if you're not sure of what you're doing.

257
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,156
- It will be bad for both of us.
- This is something I can do.

258
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,470
Okay, then why is your hand shaking?

259
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,631
What the hell are you doing?

260
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,353
- Why did you lie?
- I didn't want to involve you.

261
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,351
You decide to put on a gown
and play surgeon?

262
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,670
- Tell me the goddamn truth!
- Escobar came to me.

263
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,830
He said you and Sean
refused to operate on his wife

264
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,194
and he was gonna make you pay.

265
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,271
- So I begged him not to. I could do it.
- You're lying!

266
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,839
Everything you say is a goddamn lie.

267
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,434
- Why did he come to you?
- He knew we were engaged.

268
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,717
That I loved you.
He was hoping I could change your mind.

269
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,675
How do you know him?

270
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,672
- How do you know him?
- Christian, you're hurting me!

271
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,998
James worked for him.

272
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,997
Prostitution? That's bullshit.

273
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,991
He stuffs his bitches' tits full of heroin.

274
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,674
They're worth more to him as mules
than they are whores.

275
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,957
He runs an international
organ harvesting ring.

276
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,115
What?

277
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,792
That's when I stopped working for James.

278
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,155
When she expanded her business
and joined forces with him.

279
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,559
So Liz's kidney...

280
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,993
James had a quota to meet.

281
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,548
Escobar hated it when you were behind.

282
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,634
When I refused to help her,
she took Liz's kidney as a punishment.

283
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,711
- God!
- I didn't know anything about it.

284
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,030
I swear. You can't think that of me.

285
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,311
He said if I helped
with his wife's procedure,

286
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,152
he'd leave afterwards. I'd be free.

287
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,549
So coming to McNamara/Troy,
was that all part of your plan?

288
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,870
Burt was humiliated
after his cancer operation.

289
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,076
James trafficked in beautiful people.

290
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,879
When she said you were the best,
I believed her.

291
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,510
She must have heard it from Escobar.

292
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,994
Is there anything you haven't lied about?

293
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,034
That I love you. I love you.
I've never lied about that.

294
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,797
And what does he have on you?

295
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,909
What? What are you talking about?

296
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm not the only one
with secrets, Christian.

297
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,590
There's a reason you agreed to fix his face.
A known criminal.

298
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,199
I'm a plastic surgeon.

299
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,636
If somebody wants to improve
their appearance, I quote them a price.

300
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,109
I don't ask them
how they're gonna pay for it.

301
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,668
Christian, help me. Help us.

302
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,270
Thanks for helping me out, partner.

303
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,999
The nerve damage is so severe,
I could never fly solo on this one.

304
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,718
Don't "partner" me, Christian.

305
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,756
I'm consenting to do this as a favor to you.

306
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,229
That doesn't mean
I'm consenting to your choices.

307
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,469
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

308
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,950
How many times does she have to lie
before you open your eyes?

309
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,237
She may not have
actually removed Liz's kidney,

310
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,629
but she brought the people who did
into our lives.

311
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,030
We do this, he leaves,
and takes his wife with him. Right?

312
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,997
We're free, finally.

313
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,638
Look, we've all done something
we're ashamed of,

314
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,039
and this surgery
is gonna make things right.

315
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,635
It's not the past I'm worried about,
Christian, it's your future.

316
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,149
Liars don't just pick a day to stop lying.

317
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,391
And if you lay down with dogs
you can wake up with fleas.

318
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,228
- Speaking of dogs...
- Okay, not today, Christian.

319
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,470
I'm only here because of my feminist guilt.

320
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,028
If that woman hadn't been brutalized
even worse than I was,

321
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,112
there is no way in hell you'd get me in
the same room with her pig husband.

322
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,475
I can always find myself
another anesthesiologist.

323
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,074
Well, you know what, Christian?
That is a really good idea.

324
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,039
Because if this is indicative of
how things are gonna be at Troy/Landau,

325
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,270
I won't be working here much longer.

326
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,109
You still haven't told me how the hell

327
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,952
we're supposed to
sneak this past the authorities.

328
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,029
Michelle already told them

329
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,032
that the surveillance cameras
and the coffee-swilling G-men

330
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,678
were bad for business.

331
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,829
They haven't had a lead in a month.

332
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,071
They agreed it was a waste of time
and taxpayers' money.

333
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,878
Just so we're clear, then.

334
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,436
Not only has your fiancée brought
a psychotic killer back into our office,

335
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,990
she's dismissed the people
who were here to protect us from him.

336
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,279
You're in my seat.

337
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,309
Hey, Lizzie.

338
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,070
Hey, I just wanted you to know
that your kidney

339
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,628
went to a very deserving
Saudi businessman.

340
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,836
I think he was a member
of the royal family.

341
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,480
I think all those guys
are members of the royal family, right?

342
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,312
- I can't do this.
- Wait.

343
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,152
If you want to touch those implants again,
you say sorry to this woman.

344
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,875
I'm sorry.

345
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,476
Make me beautiful again.

346
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,992
Lizzie, hit it.

347
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,840
Hard part's done,
you can finish on your own.

348
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,076
Sean, wait, you can't leave yet, man,
those titties have got to be perfect.

349
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,675
I'm sure Dr. Troy's new partner
will be happy to help him finish.

350
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,799
Thank you.

351
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,835
- Hey.
- Hey, Mattie.

352
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,909
Well, come on in.

353
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,032
Kimber around?
I brought something for the two of you.

354
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,677
No, she's in the bathroom getting dressed.
We have to be at the church in an hour.

355
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,593
You know, I'm sorry I couldn't make it
to the house to help you pack up.

356
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,079
Kimber had me running all over town

357
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,833
trying to find this cream for
her nonexistent stretch marks.

358
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,592
That's okay, you're busy.

359
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,028
I just wanted to give you this. Come here.

360
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,836
The house sold for the asking price.

361
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,993
Christian and Michelle gave me my share
of what the business is worth, so...

362
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,879
I wanted you
to have your share of it all, too.

363
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,351
To help start your nest egg.

364
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,192
Dad, this is a lot of money.

365
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,236
It's to help pay for your child's education.

366
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,880
Or yours,
if you decide to go back to school.

367
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,631
Kimber will really appreciate it. Thank you.

368
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,551
Does she appreciate you?

369
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,437
How is married life?
Everything you thought it'd be?

370
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,439
Yeah, it's great.

371
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,834
You don't have to stay with her, you know.

372
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,911
I think Christian was right.

373
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,590
I think she's still in love with him.

374
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,550
And I think she just married me
in some twisted way to get back at him.

375
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,711
Oh, Matt. Come here.

376
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,832
Listen, sometimes it's better
for parents to be apart.

377
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,434
Your mother and I
could never make it work.

378
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,512
We put you and Annie through so much.

379
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,955
Matt? Was that the doorbell?

380
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,950
Yeah, it was just my dad.
He just came by to drop something off.

381
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,589
I should go.

382
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,799
I still have a lot to do
before I leave tomorrow.

383
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,794
You'll come back for the birth,
though, right? Help deliver the baby?

384
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,833
It would be an honor.

385
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,637
- Sean, hi.
- Hi.

386
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,950
My dad just gave us a lot of money
for the baby's education fund.

387
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,030
Well, that's generous of you, thank you.

388
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,474
- You're gonna change?
- Yeah. I'll get dressed.

389
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,395
So, you're gonna go find some cute
movie star out in Hollywood?

390
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,875
- Do you know how much he loves you?
- What's that supposed to mean?

391
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,510
Do you even know how to be loved?

392
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,669
- I love Matt, Sean.
- No, you don't, and you know it.

393
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,718
And the sad thing is,
that baby's gonna know it, too.

394
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,835
I'm trying.

395
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,758
Well, try a little harder.

396
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,672
I want to thank you.

397
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,920
That's not necessary. This is my job.

398
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,999
I'm aware of that.

399
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,038
I'm thanking you
because you could so easily kill me.

400
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,949
Put a little extra something in the IV

401
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,034
for revenge.

402
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,111
I know you'd like to kill my husband.
It's natural. But you're afraid.

403
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,313
I'm second best now.

404
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,600
Don't tell me
you haven't thought about that.

405
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,273
Of course I have.

406
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,635
I have been shot, seduced,
humiliated, cut up.

407
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,278
I almost lost my life.

408
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,912
I spent weeks
afraid to leave my own house.

409
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,875
I still can't sleep through the night.

410
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,834
So, I know this is the $64,000 question

411
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,630
and probably there is no answer that
will really satisfy me, but I have to ask.

412
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,319
Why did you marry a pig like him?

413
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,152
Why did I marry him,
or why am I still here?

414
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,796
These are two different questions.

415
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,078
Well, I assume that when you married him,
you didn't know any better. Right?

416
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,631
He was quiet and soft-spoken.

417
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,831
I mistake that for sweetness.

418
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,435
But he is not sweet, he is weak.

419
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,951
You know what they say,
"Beware of weak men. "

420
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,393
They're the most dangerous because
they'll do anything for a little power.

421
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,476
With all the money and the drugs,

422
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,870
it wasn't long
before he became a complete monster.

423
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,597
But doesn't being married to him

424
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,150
and running his business
make you Mrs. Monster?

425
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,797
History will decide that.

426
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,274
My husband has a very long reach.

427
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,518
I'm a practical woman.

428
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,071
I want to keep my children safe.

429
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,356
I want to thank you, because you
have made me feel very blessed.

430
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,432
When you leave here,
you're still stuck in your living hell.

431
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,668
But me, I'll be free.

432
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,116
- Tell me what you want, baby.
- Tell what?

433
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,190
Anything. Tell me.

434
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,828
I want to know if you had anything to do
with taking people's kidneys.

435
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,154
No.

436
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,958
Then why would Escobar trust you
with the surgery?

437
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,428
And why did he come to you
to fix his face?

438
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,634
Is there something you're not telling me?

439
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,957
I already told you the truth.

440
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,709
The nanny called.

441
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,758
She said she had to take her mom
to the doctor tomorrow.

442
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,115
I said I'd stay home and watch Wilber.

443
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,915
We're ready.

444
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,831
The big unveiling. I can't wait.

445
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,992
Where are you two perverts going?

446
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,640
You think I'm gonna let you
see my wife's tits?

447
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,110
You stay here,
and stop screwing around with the lotions.

448
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,589
You smell like a couple of panty liners.

449
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,115
Let's begin.

450
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,910
Doctors, if you don't mind
I'd like to finish undressing my bride.

451
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,039
It's okay?

452
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,391
Get your hands off her.

453
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,675
- Jesus Christ, Liz.
- Have you gone crazy?

454
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,035
Crazy is trusting that this monster
is ever gonna leave us alone.

455
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,997
This is gonna end right here.

456
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,234
Hey, Lizzie, my sweet little angel,
what's gotten into you?

457
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,038
I'll tell you what's gotten into me.

458
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,554
You took my kidney, you asshole!

459
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,757
You opened me up and you took it out!

460
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,958
Liz, just put the gun down, all right?

461
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,632
- Dr. Cruz?
- Come on, put it down.

462
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,392
Look at the way your hand is shaking.

463
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,072
Baby, you ever even held a gun before?

464
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,639
For Christ's sake, put the gun down!

465
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,948
I'm not putting this gun down.

466
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,079
I have wanted to do this ever since
you put a bullet in my leg.

467
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,674
The only reason I agreed to help
with her surgery

468
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,117
is so that I could get close enough to you
to return the favor.

469
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,155
This is gonna end, right here!

470
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,997
Pull the trigger, then. Kill me.
Pull the trigger, anesthesiologist.

471
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,640
- Put me to sleep.
- Shut up! Shut up.

472
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,269
Dr. Cruz. Dr. Cruz, this is not your way.
I know your pain.

473
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,557
- Lizzie, put the gun down.
- Dr. Cruz, give me the gun.

474
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,630
- I said, give me the gun.
- Lizzie, put the gun down.

475
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,837
Come on, put it down!

476
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,675
See, that's my girl, saving my ass again.
Is she the bomb or what?

477
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,034
Christ.

478
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,359
Put them down. Put them down!

479
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,078
Do you want to work for me
or a dead body?

480
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,068
Good, then go get my car.

481
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,555
You killed him.

482
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,996
Yeah, well, I certainly
wasn't going to screw him again.

483
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,156
That pedazo de mierda makes love
like an adolescent bull.

484
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,874
Besides, business was better without him.

485
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,674
Take it as payment for the surgery.

486
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,873
Now you can be sure
that he'll leave you alone.

487
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,150
- So, am I checked out or what?
- You need to take him with you.

488
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,356
I know. It would be a bitch
to get through customs.

489
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,839
You can have him.

490
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,114
Thank you for my breasts, Doctor.

491
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,520
Well? What are we gonna do?

492
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,434
- What are we gonna do, fix this?
- How?

493
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,115
Can't go to the authorities now,
the questioning would never end.

494
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,918
- We have to get rid of him.
- Well, where?

495
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,752
Where are we gonna do that?

496
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,989
Where?

497
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,268
I know a place.

498
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,799
You got the twine?

499
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,396
There we go. Twine.

500
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,638
Now what do we do?

501
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,235
Wait.

502
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,955
This is what you did to Silvio's body.

503
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,433
Yeah. No evidence.

504
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,511
Lizzie, you missed a bit.

505
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,232
I'm gonna need a raise, Christian.
Big raise.

506
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,358
Thank you for waiting.

507
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,953
Well, judging from your qualifications,

508
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,600
I would think
you're interviewing for my job.

509
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,153
I'm really not interested
in that kind of pressure anymore.

510
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,912
You wouldn't have that problem here.

511
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,037
85% of our clients
are breast enlargement,

512
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,556
actresses who want lipo and BOTOX
shots, that sort of thing.

513
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,716
Are you sure you're interested
in joining such a large staff?

514
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,951
With all due respect,
I've spent the better part of my life

515
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:11,433
trying too hard to really change people,
give them new faces, new bodies.

516
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,519
It doesn't work.

517
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,954
I think I'm the one
who needs to change now.

518
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,673
Well, what can I say?

519
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,834
Welcome to California, Doctor McNamara.
And welcome to the team.

520
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,559
Are you ready
to make the first incision, Doctor?

521
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,279
Actually, I'd prefer
if you made the first cut, Dr. McNamara.

522
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,839
I'm kind of nervous.

523
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,356
And actually, I'm not a doctor.
Third-year intern.

524
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,156
- And I take it this is your first assist?
- Yeah.

525
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,276
And it is such an honor to do it with you.

526
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,237
I mean, we read about you
and your partner in med school.

527
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,551
The Rosenberg surgery,
your son's recent ectrodactyly operation.

528
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,519
You're kind of a legend.
Way too legendary to be working here.

529
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,400
I'll do the first eye, you can do the second.

530
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,948
And don't be nervous,
you're in good hands.

531
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,749
Got it.

532
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,268
15-blade.

533
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,149
Suction.

534
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,232
You want that,
you'll have to take me to dinner first.

535
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,073
Scoot over, junior.

536
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,634
I'm sorry, you are...

537
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,312
Dr. Troy, from McNamara/Troy.

538
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,516
- Maybe you've heard of us.
- Dr. Troy? Oh, my God.

539
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,114
- I was just telling Doctor...
- What kind of car do you drive, son?

540
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,838
- A Civic?
- How'd you know that?

541
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,433
Hate to burst your bubble, buddy,

542
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,637
but I think you're a little inexperienced
to be assisting my partner, Dr. McNamara,

543
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,312
in a very, very complicated surgery.

544
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,550
I know. I was worried about it, too.

545
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,879
Listen to me, son.
There's a Lamborghini out front.

546
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,111
Take it for a drive, take it for a wash,
and then have it back in an hour.

547
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,713
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

548
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,595
Yeah.

549
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,196
Nice place you're working at here.

550
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,679
I haven't seen color on walls like this

551
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,230
since we puked up wine coolers
during our sophomore year, remember?

552
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,788
I remember. What are you doing here?

553
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,239
Taking a vacation.

554
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,948
Yeah, took Wilber up to Universal City,

555
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,951
left him with the nanny
at the Peninsula Hotel,

556
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,918
did the whole Mann Chinese Theatre stuff,
all the touristy crap.

557
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,831
- Get me a sponge.
- Sure.

558
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,198
You know what my first impression
of Hollywood is, Sean?

559
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,599
It's a shithole.

560
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,878
Where's the excitement I grew up
reading about, where's the glamour?

561
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,076
Huh? This town needs me.

562
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,557
Which is why I'm moving here.

563
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,714
- With Michelle?
- Actually, she bought me out.

564
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,478
You love her, Christian.

565
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,274
I do love her. But I can't trust her.

566
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,759
Apparently, you're the only person
I can trust.

567
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,513
Absolutely trust.

568
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,794
Which got me thinking,
I'm auditioning new partners.

569
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,518
Maybe you're interested.

570
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,513
Why would you need a partner?

571
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,194
You must be rolling in it
after Michelle's buyout.

572
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,431
Actually, the buyout isn't so lucrative
when you quit,

573
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,788
and ask for the ring back on the same day.

574
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,789
Yeah.

575
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,636
Just so you know, this Encino crap
ain't gonna cut it. All right?

576
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,029
It's Rodeo Drive the whole way.

577
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,237
With my sizzling good looks
and brilliant business savvy,

578
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,393
and your moderately impressive talent,
I think we could take over this town.

579
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,200
Sorry, not interested.

580
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,635
Unless I get to pick out the carpet
this time,

581
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,029
and retain my customary first billing.

582
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,991
I think we could work something out.
Yeah.

583
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,869
Hey, sweetheart?
It's quieter than an ant's fart in here.

584
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,916
Can you get that music playing?

585
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,274
- You stay away from her.
- Don't think I can.

586
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,033
- Well, you'll have to absolutely, yes.
- Oh, no, no, no.

587
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,190
You're gonna have to. She's mine.

588
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,869
