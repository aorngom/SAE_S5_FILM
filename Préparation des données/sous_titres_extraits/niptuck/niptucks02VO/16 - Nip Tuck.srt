<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,673
No!

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,115
We have an obligation
to this community, Christian.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,078
We need to go out there
and show people how to stand up to him.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,312
Repair one of
my masterpieces again and I'll kill you.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,914
We found this next to
the carved face of a girl.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,514
It's a dare.
He wants to know if we're going to fix her.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,353
You screwed me when I was 12
and you said you loved me!

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,748
Did you sleep with him?

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,911
The only man I've been with
since I met you...

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,195
is you.

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,557
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,119
Are you kidding? Everything.

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,955
My body's dropping so fast
my gynecologist needs a hard hat.

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,077
But seriously, I was sent to you
by Barbara Busberger.

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,356
She told me
you're the best surgeons in Miami.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,636
Barbara also told me
to buy a condo down here...

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,394
without saying it's God's waiting room.

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,270
So, what exactly...

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,438
I wanna look like her.
Joan Alexandra Molinsky.

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,429
Born in Brooklyn, raised in Larchmont.
Graduated from Barnard Phi Beta Kappa.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,477
- This is you?
- That's me.

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,394
Unretouched.
The face and the photograph.

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,792
- I want you to make me look just like that.
- Like a 4-year-old girl?

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,394
I think I want you to do the surgery.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,038
- You haven't said what it is yet.
- Sign this first, if you don't mind.

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,112
Confidentiality agreement?

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,193
Ms. Rivers, everybody knows
that you've had a few procedures done.

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,429
A few?

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,479
My face has been tucked in more times
than a bed sheet at the Holiday Inn.

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,153
What I want you people to do...

32
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,993
I don't want the media to know about it
till it's finished.

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,549
That's why I came to Miami
instead of New York or L. A.

34
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,790
Once you unveil me,
we'll hit the talk shows.

35
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,918
<i>I'll do Oprah, Larry King, Regis and Kelly...</i>

36
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,516
<i>and the cover of People magazine.
I know it will happen.</i>

37
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,759
As long as we're clear that signing this
doesn't obligate us to do the surgery.

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,356
There's no obligation.
Just that you keep it undercover.

39
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,309
Great.

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,671
Okay. Here it is.

41
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,553
I've always wanted to have a twin
because I wanted to see...

42
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,109
what I would look like
if I never had plastic surgery.

43
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,555
But I don't have a twin. I just have me.

44
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,359
So I want you to put me back
the way I would look...

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,795
if I had never been Joan Rivers.

46
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,358
I'm confused. Are you asking us
to do a complete makeover...

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,877
- that will restore your natural appearance?
- Yes. It'll be career Viagra.

48
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,117
I can bring back all those jokes
I used to do about myself...

49
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,554
before plastic surgery.

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,235
I had great jokes. I was so ugly
that if I wanted to moon somebody...

51
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,631
I'd just show them my face.
Or, my body is dropping so fast...

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,758
I can have a mammogram
and a pedicure at the same time.

53
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,992
Ms. Rivers, with all the work
that you've had done...

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,676
it seems like a pretty extreme thing to do
for the sake of your career.

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,279
Well, it's not just my career.

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,350
It's also my grandson, Cooper.

57
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,795
We have the most amazing relationship.
It's probably the most...

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,997
honest relationship I've ever had
with anybody in my whole life.

59
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,469
He loves me exactly the way I am.

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,874
- So why change?
- I'm a goddamn lie.

61
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,195
Look...

62
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,757
I know I'm the one that brought
plastic surgery into the mainstream.

63
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,151
I know I'm the one that convinced
all those thousands of housewives...

64
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,357
if you don't like your face,
then do something about it, change it.

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,478
But now I want to send out
a different message.

66
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,234
My grandson is... He's so pure.

67
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,790
He's so happy with himself the way he is...

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,632
and I want him to stay that way.

69
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,236
<i>I don't want him to grow up hating
the thought that he's gonna get older.</i>

70
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,951
I don't want him to care if he gets acne
at 20 or if his hair starts to recede at 40.

71
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,392
I just want him to know
there's nothing to be ashamed of.

72
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,869
It's the natural order of things.

73
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,114
And, boy...

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,629
<i>it will get me some magazine cover.
People. Oh, my God.</i>

75
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,713
Before, after. No one's ever done
something like that. It's gold.

76
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,756
And I could use a cover. I haven't had one
since 1994. Those sons of bitches.

77
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,758
<i>Come on, what about it?</i>

78
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,276
I am offering you
the mother of all plastic surgeries.

79
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,993
Will you do it?

80
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,071
You never smile anymore.

81
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,593
Talk to me, Ava.

82
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,515
Tell me, how can I make you happy?

83
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,474
- We'll never be happy.
- Aren't we happy right now?

84
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,795
Here in our warm little cocoon.

85
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,356
But once we leave the safety of this nest,
they'll always be there.

86
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,555
Harassing us, judging us, tormenting us.

87
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,951
They'll never understand.

88
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,319
To them, our relationship is unnatural.

89
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,792
Let's go away, then.

90
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,073
Let's go away
and start a new life together.

91
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,678
Let's go to Paris.

92
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,712
My life is here, Matt.

93
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,356
We'll eat croissants all day.

94
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,232
We'll drink wine. We'll make love.

95
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,470
I can't. Adrian might come back.

96
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,637
You have a cell phone.

97
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,237
I have medical issues.

98
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,350
We'll find a doctor in Paris.

99
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,519
I'll get three months of your medications
from my dad's office.

100
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,880
Your whole life is ahead of you, Matt.

101
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,110
There isn't one without you.

102
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,839
You smiled.

103
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,632
Just say yes, Ava.

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,194
Say yes.

105
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,515
My God, when is this gonna end?
Four new victims this month alone.

106
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,877
The cuts on her face
look worse than the others.

107
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,195
He's getting bolder. Probably feels
he's not getting enough attention.

108
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,316
You're the one stealing his headlines.

109
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,756
Not by choice.
Why are you fixing his work again?

110
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,230
Because every other plastic surgeon
in town is afraid to.

111
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,634
It's my moral obligation.
I'd stop it if I could, but I can't.

112
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,074
15-blade.

113
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,230
Sean. How's it hanging, homie?

114
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,110
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- You started a war, Sean.

115
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,192
You're gonna need more than a scalpel
to finish it.

116
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,279
Hey, sexy. How's that leg?

117
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,433
What are you talking about?

118
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,160
You and The Carver, brother.
You remember what he said.

119
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,198
Fix his work again,
he's coming back for you.

120
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,151
You asked how to stop it.
I'm telling you. Cap his ass.

121
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,272
You, of all people,
know I can't use this thing.

122
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,634
15-blade.

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,115
Pussy.

124
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,910
Maybe what you really need
are some balls, bro.

125
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,992
I've got balls. You know I do.
You're in jail because of me.

126
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,516
That was your finest hour.
Truth is, Sean, I made you a man.

127
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,989
- You didn't do shit.
- I gave you the guts to pull a gun.

128
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,197
I gave you the strength to risk
killing someone to save yourself...

129
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,875
and your family. And your business.
I gave you character.

130
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,593
Where did it go?

131
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,438
And what's with this music?
I hate this shit.

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,436
Now that's more like it.
God, do I love the '80s.

133
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,190
Turn that down.
I can't operate under these conditions.

134
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,356
Hey. You think fixing her face
is going to make everything better?

135
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,557
You wanna restore real order
to this mess, Sean?

136
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,671
You gotta be ready to go one-on-one
with The Carver. Like you did with me.

137
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,710
I think she needs some more gas.

138
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,156
No. I won't do that again.

139
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,998
Yes, you will.
Because you got a death wish.

140
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,878
So repressed, our little Sean.

141
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,759
You gotta take this guy out.

142
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,595
Restore the order and kill The Carver.
Kill The Carver.

143
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,031
Don't tell me this guy scares you
more than me. I'm getting jealous.

144
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,349
Shut up!

145
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,159
- Make me.
- Gun.

146
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,193
Good. Ready? Aim. Shoot!

147
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,996
What the hell are you doing?

148
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,794
Nothing.

149
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,793
I was just...

150
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,798
Temesta?
You're stealing anti-anxiety pills?

151
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,354
Look, I've been upset, okay?
And I didn't feel like asking for them...

152
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,909
and going through the third degree.

153
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,711
Helix? Don't you know
it's dangerous to self-prescribe?

154
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,032
Come on. They sell this shit
at school to help you get through...

155
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,430
Get your hands off me.

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,549
Clomiphene citrate has nothing to do
with stress, asshole.

157
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,794
I'm sick of your goddamn lies, Matt!

158
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,711
I don't know what's going on,
but clearly these pills aren't for you.

159
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,189
So you tell me
why you're stealing these drugs...

160
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,271
or I will personally bring you to the cops...

161
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,431
encourage them to lock you up
and keep you...

162
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,672
- until you're too old to enjoy them!
- Okay, fine!

163
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,836
They're for Ava. I'm stocking up.

164
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,669
Why?

165
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,355
Because we're going away. Forever.

166
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,873
Go ahead. Turn me in to the police.
I'll deny everything.

167
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,759
Matt will support me entirely,
and all you'll accomplish...

168
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,070
is starting a criminal file
for your very own son.

169
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,719
Matt won't be arrested. You will.

170
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,552
Pharmaceutical drug theft is a felony.

171
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,790
<i>Do your research
before you come into my house...</i>

172
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,520
with your pathetic Chicken Little act.

173
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,469
Vodka, rocks. If memory serves...

174
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,996
you downed it last time you were here
barking similar hollow threats.

175
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,912
Drink up and then get out.

176
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,193
How barbaric.

177
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,558
Despite your doctor's degree
and your slick veneer of sophistication...

178
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,234
when it comes to women
and how to treat them...

179
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,749
you've crawled right out of a cave.

180
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,434
I'd watch my mouth if I were you.

181
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,517
Or what? You'll hit me?

182
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,912
If you were a man, after the hell you've
caused my family, you'd be on the floor.

183
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,953
And you'd be right on top of me,
wouldn't you, Christian?

184
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,270
Because you want me, don't you?

185
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,509
You lubricate acid. If I stuck my dick
in you, it would sizzle off.

186
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,150
Oh, it would sizzle all right.

187
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,270
Matt's not here. But you knew that
before you walked in here...

188
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,398
carrying your big stick
you're afraid to swing.

189
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,232
You're not upset Matt's seeing me.

190
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,550
- You're upset that you're not.
- You're crazy.

191
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,994
And let me make myself clear.

192
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,233
I'm not leaving this hell house
until you agree to stop seeing Matt.

193
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,637
I will kill you before I let you
take him out of this country.

194
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,315
Screw the petty threats.
You want me to stop seeing Matt?

195
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,113
Then make me.

196
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,272
You want me to stop?

197
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,356
Then there's only one thing for you
to do, Christian. Make me want you more.

198
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,275
Conquer me. You don't have the guts.

199
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,078
Neither does Sean or Julia.
I have the power, and I'm keeping it.

200
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,790
I see now.
You're just like the rest of them.

201
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,839
Threatened, kowtowed, spineless.
Terrified of the unconditional.

202
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,038
Of a woman
with mental and sexual intelligence.

203
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,797
You disappoint me, Christian.
In the end, you're all bark and no bite.

204
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,516
- Bite me.
- How hard?

205
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,558
You started it. You're gonna finish it.

206
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,839
No. Not that!

207
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,873
You wanna be conquered?
Consider it done.

208
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,558
What's wrong?
Am I too much of a woman for you?

209
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,151
No, Sean. I can't allow this.

210
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,914
- It's the only way to make him stop.
- When?

211
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,118
I don't know. End of the week?

212
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,158
Pull the security detail off.
Let him see that I'm vulnerable.

213
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,634
We're waiting inside the house.

214
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,234
No, he's smart. He'll sense that.
We don't tell anybody.

215
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,075
My family, my partner. No one.
I'll be alone with him. Just me.

216
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,869
And once he thinks he's got
what he wants, then you come in.

217
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,754
We're sort of
in the middle of something here.

218
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,273
It can wait.

219
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,637
- This had better be important, Christian.
- It is.

220
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,993
Ava's a man.

221
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,916
Anything?
Still checking.

222
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,312
Are you certain she didn't just have
a naturally shallow vaginal canal?

223
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,758
Believe me,
there was nothing natural about it.

224
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,678
You're plastic surgeons.
If this is true, I don't understand...

225
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,239
why you couldn't tell right away.

226
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,870
She's the goddamn Hope Diamond of
transsexuals. Flawless in every way.

227
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,873
I called Abe Ruckman at the
Avon Sexual Reassignment Clinic...

228
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,600
Stephanie Duncan at the
Gene Identity Center in Colorado.

229
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,911
Nobody's ever heard of her.
Ava Moore has never existed.

230
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,798
As a woman, you mean.

231
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,270
Look, Julia, I thought it was
a preposterous conjecture, too.

232
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,115
Then he gave me the list of drugs
Matt was stealing for her.

233
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,238
- This is Greek to me.
- The compounds are very specific.

234
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,675
Spironolactone for breast
and nipple development.

235
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,592
Premarin for vaginal dryness.

236
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,673
And all in amounts and calibrations
we've never even seen before.

237
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,953
It's quite brilliant, really.

238
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,509
No prescription to chase?
Nothing.

239
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,116
- We need to tell Matt.
- No.

240
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,590
If this is true, and he finds out,
he will never recover from it...

241
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,150
and he'll be sexually ruined
for the rest of his life.

242
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,309
And if he finds out
you screwed his girlfriend...

243
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,836
he will never forgive you for it
or trust you again, Christian.

244
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,594
What? She jumped me.

245
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,553
Bedroom cam's working great, Sean.
So's that one in the dining room.

246
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,278
<i>What's that for?</i>

247
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,191
It's just part of the new security system
I'm putting in.

248
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,920
- Thanks. We'll talk later.
- All right.

249
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,999
Not one match.

250
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,354
Let me see.

251
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,998
We can't just keep
barging into her house...

252
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,390
and confronting her
without indisputable proof.

253
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,633
We get one more chance at this before
she leaves town and takes him with her.

254
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,074
Well, at least she thinks like a woman.

255
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,950
Hermes?

256
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,749
Remember when Suzanne hired a private
investigator to follow her husband?

257
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,674
He told her about a site where you could
look up other people's credit accounts.

258
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,038
She has an outstanding balance
at the Hermes store in Vienna, Virginia.

259
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,833
How close is Baltimore
to Vienna, Virginia?

260
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,472
- How old is Adrian again?
- Seventeen. Matt's age.

261
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,517
Well, 17 years ago, if you wanted
a state-of-the-art sex change...

262
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,353
there really was only one place
in the world to go.

263
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,671
The person you need to see at
Johns Hopkins is Carol, formerly Carlos.

264
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,955
She's been there 10 years.

265
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,997
Why would showing up in person
do the trick...

266
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,559
when leaving five messages didn't?

267
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,473
Sofia says the transgender community
is incredibly protective.

268
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,551
They won't open up
to someone they don't know.

269
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,073
They need to see you to trust you.

270
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,789
Explain to me how two strangers
can build a relationship in five minutes.

271
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,555
For God's sake. You've charmed half
of the female population of Miami.

272
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,553
- Not to mention a few transsexuals.
- One transsexual.

273
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,676
- And Ava fooled everybody.
- Not everybody.

274
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,831
There was a reason
I wasn't attracted to her.

275
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,560
- What if charm doesn't work? Any ideas?
- Be empathetic.

276
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,439
Convince her that you're there
as professionals to help Ava.

277
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,158
That you're concerned in her welfare.

278
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,799
- I'm not sure I'm a good liar.
- I am.

279
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,632
Come on. We're late.

280
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,317
This one here's a Fillet Tarpon Bay
with a rubber handle.

281
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,596
Real good for securing the grip.

282
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,877
Real nice choice
for barbecuing or dressing meats.

283
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,839
This one's my favorite.
A Buck Nighthawk. Very stealthy.

284
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,156
Comes with a nylon sheath.

285
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,239
It has a 650 tool steel
drop point blade for a real long life...

286
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,630
no matter what the elements.

287
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,435
Any other questions for you today?

288
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,357
Yes. Which one would you recommend
if I wanted to gut something?

289
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,195
<i>Dr. Davis,
telephone, please.</i>

290
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,834
I went into a men's restroom yesterday.

291
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,871
I've never been so scared.

292
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,553
You've been living as a man now
for five years, J. T.

293
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,996
<i>You've certainly used the male restroom
since your surgery, right?</i>

294
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,673
<i>So why the fear?</i>

295
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,476
It was a trough urinal...

296
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,195
where all the guys pee in the open.

297
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,269
<i>What if the guy next to me
sees it's a brand-new penis and...</i>

298
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,590
he wants to beat me down? You know?

299
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,631
See, you know what? You just need
to learn how to protect yourself.

300
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,839
Does nothing make you afraid, Carol?
Is there nothing you fear?

301
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,555
Yeah.

302
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,628
Airports.

303
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,792
Making it through security as a woman.

304
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,637
Man, since 9/11, it's like...

305
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,598
It's like they scrutinize so carefully now.

306
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,110
Lord, if you can make it through
those security lines...

307
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,239
undetected and accepted,
it's like you're real.

308
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,314
You know?

309
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,039
This is a closed meeting. Can I help you?

310
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,874
We're looking for Carol Nelson
in Room 305.

311
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,234
And you are?

312
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,949
I'm Dr. Christian Troy.
This is my partner, Sean McNamara.

313
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,394
We've been trying to reach you.
Sofia Lopez gave us your name.

314
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,759
Listen. Now why don't we just take
a quick little break?

315
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,913
Go outside, have a little snack.
And I'll see you guys back in 10.

316
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,232
Thanks a lot, Carol.

317
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,389
How can I help you?
We're plastic surgeons.

318
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,870
We've flown from Miami because
we need medical information on a patient.

319
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,950
Really?

320
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,032
I guess as surgeons and friends
of Sofia's, you have to know...

321
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,830
that a gender-reassignment file is as
classified as a nuclear weapons program.

322
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,319
We are aware of that, Ms. Nelson,
and we're completely sympathetic.

323
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,759
- So who's the patient?
- The name she goes by now is Ava Moore.

324
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,278
My partner Sean was the surgeon
who performed Sofia's bottom surgery.

325
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,159
He also saved her
from a botched tracheal shave.

326
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,598
Well, that's touching. But it doesn't
change a thing, gentlemen.

327
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,598
You see, these people here?
They're fragile.

328
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,991
So why is it
that I should betray their confidence?

329
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,955
If Ava Moore wants her records,
why hasn't she contacted us?

330
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,833
Because Ava is afraid. Seventeen years
ago, when she had her surgery...

331
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,831
there was no community.

332
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,354
She needs help. She's had a weakening
of the reconstructed vaginal wall...

333
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,909
and the bladder is coming through.

334
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,555
For us to repair it, we need to see
her records, because she claims that...

335
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,554
she had an adverse reaction
to the anesthesia in her original surgery.

336
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,154
We're here to help Ava, Ms. Nelson.

337
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,798
We're not into taking risks with her life.

338
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,753
Well, you don't wanna talk to me.
You want to talk to her surgeon.

339
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,277
He's retired,
and he's taken her records with him.

340
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,119
Where is he?

341
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,598
Dr. Barrett Moore?

342
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,949
I've been expecting you, Doctors.

343
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,390
I understand you've met my wife.

344
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,359
Pollinator.

345
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,914
Hybrids.

346
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,116
The first orchid hybrids
were produced in 1858...

347
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,159
and since then the process
has accelerated. But because of their...

348
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,675
artificial and unnatural evolution...

349
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,149
they're unable to attract
a suitable pollinator...

350
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,995
and hand pollinization is so unreliable...

351
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,952
and time-consuming.

352
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,589
There are mysteries to be solved.

353
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,993
You retired from medicine
to become a botanist?

354
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,232
I retired from medicine
because my work was done.

355
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,995
Every orchid here has been altered.

356
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,199
Each one evolving right before our eyes
into new species...

357
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,270
changing their very identities.

358
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,118
You mastered the technique on humans.
Why turn to flowers?

359
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,509
Because they never leave.
And they rarely disappoint.

360
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,510
Humans and medicine are so...

361
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,434
fallible.

362
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,548
There was nothing fallible
in your transformation of Ava Moore.

363
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,349
She's the work of a medical genius
at the peak of his career.

364
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,159
Why stop at the height of your success?

365
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,395
Avery Tanner is responsible
for the success that I have.

366
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,552
He was a walker, which is to say
that he was an escort...

367
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,157
to some of the wealthiest society women
looking for philanthropic causes.

368
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,431
He was a very good-looking young man...

369
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,717
and unusually interested
in the unorthodox work...

370
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,110
of an inexperienced new doctor.

371
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,679
He would bring them
to my fundraisers...

372
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,994
and charm them
into giving large donations...

373
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,470
for a field of medicine
that they barely understood.

374
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,193
At first, I thought as a gay man,
he was drawn to the transgender world...

375
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,113
because of the possibilities for himself.

376
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,599
But he wasn't. He was drawn to me.

377
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,039
We became close,
but I couldn't be with him...

378
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,316
the way that he wanted me to.

379
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,758
That's not my nature.

380
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,676
One night, Avery came to me in despair.

381
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,068
Suicidal.

382
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,117
And he asked if I were to change him
into a woman, could I love him then?

383
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,877
And I believed that I could.

384
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,630
The resulting operation was...

385
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,669
perfect.

386
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,876
Thank you, Harry. You may go.

387
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,511
To an outsider, we were like
any other happily married couple.

388
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,194
But on the inside, sexually...

389
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,192
I could not forget.

390
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,639
She thought that a child
might normalize what wasn't.

391
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,349
So we agreed that my assistant
would be impregnated with my sperm...

392
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,636
and carry the baby to term for us.

393
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,759
After Adrian was born,
things seemed to be more comfortable.

394
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,309
But soon after, they deteriorated.

395
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,636
I couldn't give her what she wanted.
It wasn't her fault.

396
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,950
I was the failure.

397
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,038
I couldn't see... her.

398
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,034
I could only see my own work.

399
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,433
And so she left?

400
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,475
I came home one day
from a conference and they were gone.

401
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,194
And I've never heard from her since.

402
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,154
How is she?

403
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,835
She's given up philanthropy
for a career as a life coach.

404
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,589
The ultimate creature of transformation
transforming others.

405
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,515
There is some poetry in that, Doctors,
you have to admit.

406
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,196
Her behavior isn't poetic. It's predatory.

407
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,038
Ava Moore is sleeping
with my 17-year-old son.

408
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,348
And yours.

409
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,870
Sleeping with juvenile males makes sense.

410
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,952
They're not experienced enough
to spot a fraud.

411
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,396
I had planned on one last procedure...

412
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,791
to go in, reconstruct the vaginal floor.

413
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,871
Make it less constricted.

414
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,711
I thought maybe it would bring her
some sense of peace, some closure.

415
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,317
But I couldn't find her.

416
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,236
- It would help us if we could see her files.
- You know better than to ask that.

417
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,676
We need to confront her
with more than just a story.

418
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,232
You couldn't save your son from her,
Dr. Moore.

419
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,271
At least help me save mine.

420
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,959
Hey, can I come in?
Please.

421
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,758
I probably should have called first.

422
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,435
- Is your friend here?
- Kevin? Oh, no, he's teaching.

423
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,429
- Did you get it?
- Yeah. And I brought you something else.

424
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,199
Just in case.

425
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,796
You shouldn't need it,
but for when Kevin isn't here.

426
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,798
- You've got to stop doing this.
- Doing what?

427
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,555
Stopping by to give me Mace,
asking me to stay over.

428
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,912
You don't need to protect me.
You're the one who was attacked.

429
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,436
We may be separated, but I'm still
allowed to worry about you, aren't I?

430
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,151
- I'm the one who's worried about you.
- Why? I'm fine.

431
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,517
Don't do anything silly
to prove that you're brave.

432
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,113
Your courage
has already been documented.

433
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,311
Did Matt agree to see you?

434
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,309
- We're meeting him for lunch.
- Good.

435
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,718
Be direct but gentle.

436
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,757
Are you sure you want to handle Ava
on your own?

437
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,830
Yeah.

438
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,157
I'm the one who got her into his life.
I should be the one to get her out.

439
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,712
It's been a long time since I've seen you
as Julia, instead of my wife.

440
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,708
I like it.

441
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,872
- Who else knows about this?
- Three of us. Sean, Christian, and myself.

442
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,591
Angry villagers with torches, here to
drive out the monster the doctor made.

443
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,355
I don't think you're a monster.
I think you're a sad, lonely individual...

444
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,353
who does monstrous, selfish acts
to cope with conflict.

445
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,990
Be careful with your choice of pronouns.
Have some goddamn respect.

446
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,674
I am a woman.
I don't care what this file says.

447
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,229
Break up with my son
and get out of our lives.

448
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,789
- Or what?
- Or I'll tell him the truth about you.

449
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,349
And then your well-kept secret
will be out.

450
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,398
As you know,
secrets have a way of spreading.

451
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,957
Did you ever love him?

452
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,031
I loved that he loved me.

453
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,994
I love her, all right?
And I will always love her.

454
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,799
If this is another intervention
trying to make me see her...

455
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,871
for what she is, you're wasting your time.

456
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,634
I do see her, completely,
which clearly you don't.

457
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,189
We're done with threats.
That's not why we're here.

458
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,669
We're here to support you.
Unconditionally.

459
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,831
We'll respect your choice, whatever it is.

460
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,514
My choice is her. We're leaving next week.

461
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,990
You have until the beginning
of next week to break it off and leave.

462
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,153
And if you need money, help finding
a place for you and Ava to live...

463
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,117
we want you to know
that we're here for you.

464
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,034
You're serious. I don't believe you. Why
are you doing this now? What happened?

465
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,158
What happened is you grew up.
You're not a boy now, Matt.

466
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,880
You're a man.
And we're treating you like one.

467
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,716
If it works out with Ava and you find
a cool job that you love in Gay Paree...

468
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,235
- well, that's great.
- And if it doesn't?

469
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,356
Then you'll hurt like hell.

470
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,035
But you have someplace
you can come home to, if you want.

471
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,509
I don't have anywhere else to go.

472
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,951
I don't have Adrian. I have no one.

473
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:47,830
You have yourself. And from what
I've witnessed, you're a survivor.

474
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,470
<i>And survivors reinvent themselves.</i>

475
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,871
They rise from the ashes of their failures
like phoenixes...

476
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,600
and fly off to their next destination.

477
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,952
Well, Julia, we've come full circle,
haven't we? You're coaching me now.

478
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,313
The truth of the matter is, Ava,
you really were a good life coach.

479
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,555
And if it wasn't for you
and the truths that you forced...

480
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,473
I wouldn't be able to stand up to you now.

481
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,909
I'm not leaving that easily, Julia.

482
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,558
If you want me gone,
then you talk to your doctors.

483
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,790
What do you want them to do?

484
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,828
Finish me.
Correct the one flaw that gave me away...

485
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,156
so I'm never found out again.

486
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,996
This operation will take under an hour.
You'll be up and on your feet tomorrow.

487
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,314
The last vaginoplasty hurt like hell.
Will this one?

488
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,592
The final expander
causes minimal discomfort.

489
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,839
The ditch was already dug pretty deep.
Just not deep enough for me.

490
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,873
You think this is pretty funny, don't you?

491
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,316
I'm a despicable joke to you.

492
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,716
Actually, Ava, I think you're one of the
most fascinating people I've ever met.

493
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,198
Have you done
many of these types of surgeries before?

494
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,636
No. That's why we brought in an expert.

495
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,234
Hello, Ava.

496
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,913
You are more beautiful than ever.

497
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,639
How is Adrian?

498
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,274
Like you.

499
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,952
Smart, beautiful...

500
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,594
conflicted.

501
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,031
I would like to see him.

502
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,871
I don't know where he is.

503
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,151
Or if he'll ever come home.

504
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,234
I need to be done with this, Barrett.

505
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,076
I can't keep running anymore.

506
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,033
Don't worry. That's why I'm here.

507
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,116
To finish what I started.

508
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,316
Count back from 10 for me.

509
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,710
Ten, nine...

510
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,710
eight, seven...

511
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,913
Ava, I got them.

512
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,398
Hey, I've got them.

513
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,795
What?

514
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,794
I was just saying I got them.
Two first-class tickets to Paris.

515
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,752
Great. And I'm guessing you put
the $10,000 charge on my credit card.

516
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,390
That's what you said to do.
I thought, I don't know...

517
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,348
you might surprise me
and find a way to pay for them yourself.

518
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,070
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- You!

519
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,676
You eat crap like a grubby little slob
on a $25 a yard couch...

520
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,673
and then expect mommy
to clean up your mess. I'm sick of it!

521
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,070
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make a mess.

522
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,357
But you did, Matt, and I get it.
Boys make messes.

523
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,114
They leave water marks
on the French lacquer dining table.

524
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,713
They don't do their own laundry.

525
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,475
They're helpless until they go off
to college and learn to be self-sufficient.

526
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,234
But I'm not going off to college.
I'm going off with you.

527
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,515
Oh, Christ!
What?

528
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,671
Another water mark!
Did you do this, Matt?

529
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,559
I don't know, Ava. Are you on your period?

530
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,469
Look, you're stressed and you're upset.
And I get it.

531
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,956
You just need a vacation.

532
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,711
<i>I got us a travel backgammon set...</i>

533
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,514
and a crossword puzzle book.

534
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,470
I don't like backgammon.
And I'm not going to Paris with you.

535
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,631
It's such a cliché, anyway.

536
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,070
What happened
between the time I left and now?

537
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,715
This just doesn't work for me, Matt.

538
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,158
I was a mother once. I don't want to have
to do it all over again with you.

539
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,437
The pretense that you're a man
when you're not...

540
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,916
has become wearisome for me.

541
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,036
I need a genuine companion.

542
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:53,636
There are things I've been denying myself,
things that come with age...

543
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,154
which you can't possibly understand.

544
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,432
You're afraid of the unknown, okay.
I get it.

545
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,198
But we've got to be united, just like we
always have been. We've got to be strong.

546
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,350
No, you need to be strong, Matt.

547
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,994
We had a fling and it was charming.

548
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,552
We don't have the components
to build from that.

549
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,277
To create a relationship
out of mere physical heat.

550
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,398
It was inevitable. The natural order.

551
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,957
One day you'll see that.

552
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,318
Do you have any clothes
left in the house?

553
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,435
No.

554
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,711
Everything's in here.
Good.

555
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,872
Be a good boy.
Turn around and walk out the door.

556
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,193
Did you hear me? Leave, Matt. It's over!

557
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,235
This is completely unnecessary.
You don't have to show me this.

558
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,915
We would be comfortable knowing
you entered this procedure fully informed.

559
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,117
But I don't have time to keep
schlepping down here for visual aids.

560
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,716
There are several reconstructive
procedures we want you to know about.

561
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,199
Take a look.

562
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,870
<i>We'd start by inserting
a balloon-like device, a tissue expander...</i>

563
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,349
in the areas where the skin
has been tightened...

564
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,876
allowing it to stretch
and assume a more natural hang.

565
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,710
We'd also do a flap surgery...

566
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,634
where we take tissue and fat muscle from
your back and tunnel it to your front...

567
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,031
so your breasts could regain their
age-appropriate fullness and slope.

568
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,239
In other words, I'll have saggy bad girls.
I get it, okay? I get it.

569
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,760
We'd do several skin grafts,
which would also...

570
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,069
Oh, blah, blah.

571
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,915
Please, I'm going to be late for QVC.
Just cut to the chase.

572
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,588
Of course.

573
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,834
Who's that?

574
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,519
That's you, Ms. Rivers. What you would
look like now if you had nothing done.

575
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,830
Yeah. Very funny. Who is that?

576
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,751
These computer-generated images
are only an approximation...

577
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,036
of the natural aging process.

578
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,957
That hag looks like ET.

579
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,512
It is what you asked for.

580
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,797
No, it's not what I asked for.
I asked for someone who would look...

581
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,350
like a grandmother for Cooper,
not like some piece of shit.

582
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,637
Now, what is your problem here?
The kid loves me. I make him laugh.

583
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,519
He runs to me. If I looked like that,
he'd run the other way.

584
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,114
I thought you wanted to be natural.

585
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,235
You know what's natural? Evolution.

586
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,280
Cooper doesn't live in the Stone Age.

587
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,271
He lives in the year 2004.

588
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,633
And we have tweezers,
and we have alpha hydroxy acids...

589
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,836
and we have plastic surgery.

590
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,392
And thank God, because...

591
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,111
My God. If I looked like that now,
can you imagine what I'd look like at 90?

592
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,078
- I'm glad we caught this early.
- Oh, me, too.

593
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,630
Thank you both so very much
for giving me the heads up.

594
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,158
Oh, and put me down tomorrow
for another lift.

595
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,878
Oh, what the hell?

596
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,952
I'm in town anyhow.
It'll kill a couple hours.

597
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,355
So, what are you doing tonight?

598
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,520
Apparently, planning Ms. Rivers' tuck.

599
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,715
Julia's coming by with the kids.
Matt's staying with her.

600
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,392
He's not doing too well
since the Ava breakup.

601
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,597
Can you come by
and break bread with the family?

602
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,118
I didn't know Julia wanted me back in the
family after everything that's happened.

603
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,794
We told Matt
he'd have a safe place to land.

604
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,953
No matter what else is going on,
all of us need to follow through.

605
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,869
Hi, Mom.

606
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,472
Oh, my God. Adrian.

607
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,840
I was so worried.
Where have you been?

608
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,639
Squatting on empty houseboats.
You know, the whole Cunanan thing.

609
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,473
- What do you care?
- I do care, deeply.

610
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,357
Are you going somewhere?

611
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,675
Paris. But you're coming with me.

612
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,276
You, me, and Matt?
We'd make quite a sight, wouldn't we?

613
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,114
No, I ended it with Matt. It's over.

614
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,077
You know what I think, Mom?
I think he dumped you.

615
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,271
You couldn't take it because you
don't know how to handle losing anything.

616
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,716
So now you know what you're doing,
Mom? You're running away from us all.

617
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,916
'Cause that's the only thing
you know how to do.

618
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,275
I thought you were gone forever.

619
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,396
But now we can make
a fresh start together.

620
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,755
There are no more fresh starts!

621
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,509
Everything is rotten to the core.

622
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,437
Okay, look, just come with me.

623
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,873
We'll talk about it all on the plane.
Look, I've got two tickets.

624
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,039
It'd be just the two of us,
like you've always wanted.

625
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,955
You and me, Adrian.
Everything else goes away.

626
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,598
I don't believe you.

627
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,998
That's what kills me.

628
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,516
- I love you.
- No!

629
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,558
I needed to be sure
you'd never leave me again.

630
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,630
No!

631
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,998
I love you, you know.

632
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,118
I love you, too. Always.

633
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,871
I'll help you clean up.

634
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,911
So I'll see you tomorrow?

635
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,876
Make sure you lock this door.

636
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,512
Excuse me, ma'am.

637
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,358
Could you take off
your sunglasses, please?

638
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,150
Can I see your passport, please?

639
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,439
Thank you, Ms. Moore. Have a nice flight.

640
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,108
Thank you.

641
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,270
