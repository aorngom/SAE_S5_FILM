00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,870
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,439
We maybe...

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,239
have one civil interaction
every other leap year.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,914
And now you're offering me your sperm?

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,071
I'd like to accept your offer.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,191
You already have a son, Christian.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,670
Matt.

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,230
- Christian's my real dad, isn't he?
- Yes.

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,838
None of this changes the way
that I feel about you...

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,356
- the way your dad feels about you.
- Does he even know?

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,238
Or have you been lying to him
this whole time, too?

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,791
Ms. Ripp, tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,270
How much time you got?
If you could just be precise.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,679
I banged 92 guys since I hit the streets.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,989
They don't give out ribbons
at the 4-H Fair for that, do they?

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,673
I've had five abortions.

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,195
Been arrested seven times
for disorderly conduct.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,158
Three near overdoses
'cause of the freebase.

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,674
But I'm clean now.

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,833
This is a cosmetic surgery office,
not a confessional booth.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,639
Don't be rude to me.
I see that look in your eye.

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,758
All my life,
men have been giving me that look.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,549
But I forgive you for it
just like I forgive them.

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,751
Is Christian to forgive.

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,029
Have you sustained injuries
or scars you would like removed?

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,116
Would you like to show us?

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,636
- Are you claiming you have...
- The stigmata. Yeah.

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,592
That's what I told the church, anyway,
but the truth is I did it myself.

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,156
It was my biggest sin of all.

30
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,435
You watch out for false prophets.

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,716
They come to you in sheep's clothing,
but inwardly, they're ferocious wolves.

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,191
That's Matthew 7:15.

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,591
Can I see your arms again?

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,313
<i>The other side.</i>

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,359
Did you lie and tell people
Jesus made those cutting marks, too?

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,795
I don't like him.

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,794
My civility will increase once I have proof
that your check won't bounce.

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,349
Yeah, well, that's why I came here.

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,717
I saw last week on the news
that girl got her face all cut up...

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,916
and the reporter said
y'all fixed that for free.

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,436
- That was a special case.
- Okay, look, you got to help me, okay?

42
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,556
I think I got an infection or something
setting in, because I feel hot.

43
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,711
Then go to an emergency room.

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,554
It's not the infection that's going
to kill me. Don't you get it?

45
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,752
It's the pressure.

46
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,517
Now you got to tell them that I'm a liar...

47
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,240
and they will believe you
because you're a doctor and all.

48
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,789
- I can't face them again.
- Face who?

49
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,794
Sister Rita Claire, who took me
into her program at St. Olive.

50
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,711
But mostly the parishioners.

51
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,594
They believe I'm touched by divinity.

52
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,872
So you got to tell them
that I did it just for attention.

53
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,352
You tell them that I ain't nothing special.
I ain't nothing but a whore.

54
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,158
Will you please?

55
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,069
You got to ask them to forgive me.

56
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,395
Please.

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,113
Can you believe
those poor suckers from her church?

58
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,829
So desperate to believe
in something that they deify a prostitute.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,992
You know what, Christian?
I understand that want.

60
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,197
I loved being a Catholic
when I was a kid. The drama of it.

61
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,193
The feeling that there was
a mysterious man in the heavens...

62
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,475
watching out for you.

63
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,110
When did you lapse?
When I became a pro-choice lesbian.

64
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,834
Scissors.

65
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,229
But I'm thinking about having my kid
go to church like I did.

66
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,029
You know, if only for the structure
and the comfort of it.

67
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,597
You're pregnant?
Couple of weeks. It's early.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,638
Why didn't you tell me?

69
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,917
What's with the accusatory tone?
I just found out.

70
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,911
The baby shower's
in a couple of months.

71
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,469
You'll have time to buy a new suit.
Trust me.

72
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,709
Well, congratulations to you both.

73
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,712
I just hope I'm as good a godfather
to your baby as Christian has been to Matt.

74
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,634
Remember Matt's baptism?
There wasn't one.

75
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,713
Exactly. Sean vetoed all
the religious nonsense, but kept the party.

76
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,269
A tradition I'd like to follow.
Sorry.

77
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,398
Christening gowns are the cutest.
I'm getting my kid baptized.

78
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,994
Over my dead body.
Easily arranged.

79
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,709
Even though you are not religious...

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,632
would you come
to the ceremony, Godfather?

81
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,949
I'm religious.

82
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,079
Religion is about believing in
a cause larger and more precious than you.

83
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,835
My faith rests in two higher powers,
my practice and my family.

84
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,074
Hemostat.

85
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,716
We are praying to the woman inside.

86
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,113
To Agatha.
She has been touched by God.

87
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,716
A nun at our church told us
that we could find her here.

88
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,871
I'm sorry, but this is a place of business.

89
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,838
You're going to have to leave,
or I'll have to call the police.

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,869
But God is here. With her!
Please, we need her to help us.

91
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,076
I need her to pray for my baby.

92
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,349
Is your baby sick?

93
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,957
<i>He is possessed by Satanás. Mire.</i>

94
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,315
Please, please.

95
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,154
Please have Agatha touch my baby.

96
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,632
<i>Por favor, señor.</i>

97
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,795
Father Malley, the exterior
of our office has become a shrine...

98
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,871
to a power that does not exist.

99
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,429
What do you propose I do, Dr. McNamara?

100
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,828
Tell your parish the truth.

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,911
That Agatha Ripp is a prostitute
and a fraud...

102
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,789
who inflicted the wounds herself so she
wouldn't be evicted from your shelter...

103
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,632
and have to sleep in a halfway house.

104
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,395
Dr. McNamara, I take it you reject
the concept of the miraculous.

105
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,915
Organized religion
to you is clearly a...

106
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,559
Borrowed myths.

107
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,199
Your point, Father?

108
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,273
I understand that two of our parishioners
came to you with their 6-month-old.

109
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,352
Yes, they think their child
is satanically possessed...

110
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,876
- because he has a caudal appendage.
- A caudal appendage?

111
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,270
A dermal tail adjacent to the sacrum.

112
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,955
But don't you see, Dr.
McNamara, because of Agatha...

113
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,917
a miracle has occurred.

114
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,631
The child was directed in some divine way
to you and your partner...

115
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,791
who have the talent to remove
the vertebrae...

116
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,838
and give the child a normal,
productive life.

117
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,557
Not to be rude, Father,
but I'll go out of business...

118
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,757
if I continue to do pro bono surgeries
on devotees...

119
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,639
who sadly misinterpret science
and natural law...

120
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,759
because they're not getting the education
it is your obligation to provide.

121
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,709
How is Agatha, Doctor?

122
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,390
Tomorrow, her sutures come out.

123
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,996
She's been on an antibiotic drip.
She's stabilized.

124
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,759
Does she have family?

125
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,638
<i>Someone we could discharge her to...</i>

126
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,995
who could properly look after her
during her recovery?

127
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,912
I've been searching for that information.

128
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,799
I've called two numbers in Tallahassee,
where she's from.

129
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,269
Sister, I'm sorry,
but if you can't find someone...

130
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,398
who'd be willing to step
into a guardian position...

131
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,357
we'll have to turn her over to the State.

132
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,317
Agatha will be embraced by St. Olive's...

133
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,357
until our investigation is complete...

134
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,717
and her stigmata
is either accepted by the Vatican...

135
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,836
or denied as heretical blasphemy.

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,470
- Look, stop deluding yourself...
- Would you like some proof?

137
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,629
Open it.

138
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,270
Those were taken
shortly after the discovery...

139
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,749
when the wounds were still fresh.

140
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,555
<i>As you can see, Doctor,
the stigmata are not circular or jagged...</i>

141
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,395
which would denote a puncture
with a common ice pick or knife...

142
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,518
but symmetrically square and smooth.

143
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,273
Christ's wounds at crucifixion...

144
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,355
were said to have been made
with a square peg nail.

145
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,153
I believe this to be true.

146
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,756
The Vatican believes this to
be true. But how could Agatha know this?

147
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,275
I doubt
she's ever read a book.

148
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,355
Additionally, Christ's crucifixion wounds
were on the wrists, not the hands.

149
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,399
make the mistake
of puncturing their palm.

150
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,754
The wounds are slightly odd,
I agree with you.

151
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,596
But if you refuse to embrace
the possibilities of fraud...

152
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,955
I would direct the energies
of your investigation...

153
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,079
toward psychogenic purpuras,
rather than miraculous mumbo jumbo.

154
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,519
Psychogenic purpuras?

155
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,711
<i>A psychosomatic disorder.</i>

156
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,789
<i>The body sometimes creates
physical manifestations of pain...</i>

157
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,396
<i>to express what the mind cannot.
Induced by what?</i>

158
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,236
<i>Guilt, shame.
Usually of overwhelming proportions.</i>

159
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,757
If I can acknowledge the science...

160
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,558
which gives you such sustenance...

161
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,554
why can't you, at the very least,
respect the beliefs that I have faith in?

162
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,599
A faith that not only feeds my soul
but those of my parishioners.

163
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,950
Sister, I'll keep Agatha until the end
of the week before I involve the State.

164
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,112
Agatha Ripp
is psychologically unbalanced...

165
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,919
not a candidate for beatification.

166
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,750
I'll share those thoughts with the media...

167
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,276
if that what it takes to restore order
to my place of business.

168
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,758
Dr. McNamara.

169
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,671
There will come a day,
as it does for every man...

170
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,639
when you will need more than cold logic...

171
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,237
to define you or sustain you.

172
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,235
How's that feel?
It burns.

173
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,878
I was out in the garden yesterday.
Something must have bitten me.

174
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,759
These aren't bites, Julia.
They're shingles.

175
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,591
Let's run a temp,
see if you're fighting a bigger infection.

176
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,555
- Normal.
- I don't feel sick.

177
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,312
Just a little run down.

178
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,994
- No morning sickness?
- No. Is that bad?

179
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,192
Morning sickness is a sign
that the hormones are kicking in.

180
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,636
But then again, 20%/% of all
pregnant women never feel nauseous.

181
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,190
And they have perfectly
healthy babies. Let me see the liner.

182
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,750
Some spotting in the first trimester
is normal, right?

183
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,717
Or is that a sign that something's wrong?

184
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,032
Isn't shingles a sign of lowered
immunity? Is something wrong with me?

185
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,795
You had a complete physical last month.
You checked out fine.

186
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,236
This is emotional.
Don't isolate yourself, Jules.

187
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,550
- Tell me what's going on with you.
- Nothing.

188
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,077
Just the usual stress stuff, you know?
Going to school, raising a family.

189
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,991
I guess it just all caught up with me.

190
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,994
An outbreak of shingles usually
accompanies bigger life-changing events.

191
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,718
A death, divorce.

192
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,916
Maybe it's because of Matt.

193
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,752
The Ava situation.

194
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,593
It's okay.

195
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,829
This is what happens when you raise
teenage boys.

196
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,719
You get stressed. You're gonna...

197
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,634
...be okay. You just need to relax.

198
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,116
One day we'll look back on this
and we'll laugh.

199
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,590
Yeah. You examining my panty liner.
That's hilarious.

200
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,479
I'm glad that you came to me with all this.

201
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,077
I was getting the feeling you didn't want
me involved in any way with this baby.

202
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,831
I was in a bind. I couldn't get
into my ob-gyn until tomorrow.

203
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,155
Great. Well, I'll come with you.

204
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,319
Let me know what time
the appointment is.

205
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,634
- How bad is the outbreak?
- Pretty severe.

206
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,754
I started her on a round of acyclovir
and told her to lay low.

207
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,477
I do understand the intensity
of her reaction, though.

208
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,514
Julia's never made friends easily...

209
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,111
and then when she finally did let down
her guard and invited Ava into our family...

210
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,952
only to be betrayed?

211
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,551
Agatha Ripp did at least have one point
that makes sense.

212
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,269
That Bible quote,
"Watch out for false prophets...

213
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,195
"they come to you in sheep's clothing,
but inwardly, they are ferocious wolves. "

214
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,476
That's what the devil is, you know.

215
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,315
Not some obvious Machiavellian figure
with horns and a tail...

216
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,074
but a silent foe disguised as friend.

217
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,518
Someone you trust, even love,
whom you let into your life...

218
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,636
only to find out too late
they've made a shambles of it.

219
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,392
Our patient is in twilight.
This is Taylor. He'll take it from here.

220
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,472
I don't understand.

221
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,353
Sorry, Sean. I just don't think
I'll be able to make it through the surgery.

222
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,835
What's wrong with her?

223
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,309
We've done surgical procedures
on kids before.

224
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,597
Yeah, but not kids
with congenital birth defects.

225
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,671
If I was
an expectant mother over 40...

226
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,115
I probably wouldn't want
to watch this, either.

227
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,475
Hit it.

228
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,469
We've got an emergency in recovery.

229
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,279
Linda, close.

230
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,589
- She might be septic.
- Draw a CBC.

231
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,678
Her blood pressure's dropping.

232
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,035
Liz? I need a dopamine drip.
Okay.

233
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,952
Agatha, where's the pain?

234
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,913
God damn it.

235
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,159
Sean, what are you doing?

236
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,915
Where's the instrument you used
to do this? Where'd you hide it?

237
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,514
I didn't do it. He did it.

238
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,989
- There was no one in the room but you.
- Jesus came to me again.

239
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,437
I lied the first time when I said
I did it myself.

240
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,356
God, please make it stop.

241
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,796
Thank you for calling me. How is she?

242
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,918
She's medicated.
She was bordering on hysteria.

243
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,230
Did you find the instrument
she used to puncture herself?

244
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,474
She did it to herself, I know she did.

245
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,878
Agatha is self-destructive...

246
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,749
and sadly touched by a madness...

247
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,753
that I find terrifying.

248
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,791
May we speak in private?

249
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,232
When she first came to me
and my program...

250
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,394
I asked her about the cuts on her arm.

251
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,915
She told me she began self-mutilation
shortly after her stepfather raped her.

252
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,079
Other girls in my program cut, too.
Agatha was not my first.

253
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,270
They do it to deflect the pain.

254
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,112
But they're creating pain.

255
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,068
The pain of the flesh doesn't compare
with the pain of the soul, Dr. Troy.

256
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,231
When I met with Father Malley,
why didn't you...

257
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,914
Side with you, Doctor?
Say I didn't believe?

258
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,150
He'd only
cut my program further, out of spite.

259
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,512
Sister, I think Agatha injured herself again
so she could stay in your shelter.

260
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,513
She was terrified of going back
into the county system.

261
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,355
I don't blame her.
Dogs at the pound are treated better.

262
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,758
I fear that Agatha is not
a person to Father Malley...

263
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,398
but rather a holy relic
to shine and display...

264
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,275
and only if she helps his cause.

265
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,996
I just pray that God will protect
her better interests.

266
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,031
If there is a God anymore.

267
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,633
That's a radical statement coming from
someone who's devoted her life to faith.

268
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,119
Yes, well...

269
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,597
when you see girls like Agatha...

270
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,115
resorting to self-stabbing...

271
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,158
to assure themselves
protection and food...

272
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,876
shining halos worn in youth
tend to tarnish.

273
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,279
I'm sorry.

274
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,640
You can help save Agatha, Sister.

275
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,912
You can stop her
from continuing to stab herself.

276
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,030
Tell your parishioners that she's a fraud,
that it's a continuing pattern of self-abuse.

277
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,635
If Agatha can't barter her stigmata
for security, she'll stop.

278
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,553
I can't be public on this, Doctors.

279
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,588
I can't.

280
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,349
He'll cut my programs completely.

281
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,313
You know...

282
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,915
there is one thing you could do.

283
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,351
Check the blood coming from Agatha's
stigmata against her own blood type.

284
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,555
I don't understand.

285
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,075
According
to historical teachings...

286
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,437
the blood seeping
from a genuine stigmata...

287
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,989
belongs to our Lord Jesus Christ.

288
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,709
If Agatha's own blood
weeps from her wounds...

289
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,990
then she will not be recognized.

290
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,350
The investigation will be closed...

291
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,796
and this misguided circus will be over.

292
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,913
You were right to call about the spotting.

293
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,991
The volume's increasing?

294
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,032
Yesterday I had three stains. Today, six.

295
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,278
Am I miscarrying?

296
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,309
There seems to be some bleeding
where the placenta's forming.

297
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,279
There's increased nuchal lucency,
which, as you know...

298
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,116
could be associated with chromosomal
abnormalities specific to Down's.

299
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,598
But it might not be.

300
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,554
Unfortunately, Liz, you're going to be
swimming in unknown waters for a while.

301
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,914
I'm sorry.

302
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,393
I don't do the unknown very well, Cynthia.

303
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,791
But that's what being a mother
is all about, Liz.

304
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,598
You spend your life
trusting in the unknowable.

305
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,155
Where does the trust come from?

306
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,589
Faith.

307
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,869
- Why are you doing this? It hurts.
- To make sure there's no infection.

308
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,634
I've been tested for HIV. I'm negative.

309
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,356
Don't know how that happened.

310
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,359
Maybe God has plans for you, Agatha.

311
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,113
Just like I like to think
he has plans for my baby.

312
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,878
How old's your baby?

313
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,477
He's still in here. Couple of weeks.

314
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,717
Well, congratulations.

315
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,996
You seem real nurturing and all.
I'll bet you'll make a good mom.

316
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,431
I tried to be, but I screwed it up.

317
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,713
You're a mother, Agatha?

318
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,838
Well, they took her from me, the State...

319
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,154
on account of she was born
with drugs in her system.

320
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,510
They said she could have been born
all defected...

321
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,830
and that it would have been my fault.

322
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,717
That'd be worse than dying.

323
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,158
She was fine, though.

324
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,078
She was so beautiful.

325
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,759
And I got to hold her for a minute,
right when she came out.

326
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,476
She only weighed 3 pounds.

327
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,833
I'm sorry.

328
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,629
I don't mean
to spread my misery.

329
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,475
I think something's wrong with my baby.
I can feel it.

330
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,152
I keep spotting
and my doctor told me to have faith...

331
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,709
and I'm trying, but I need a little help.

332
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,195
Agatha, do you know the Bible story
of the woman who couldn't stop bleeding?

333
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,435
There was this woman
who spent all her means...

334
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,196
and 12 years of her life...

335
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,632
trying to heal from hemorrhaging.

336
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,395
She couldn't touch
anything or anyone...

337
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,555
because the object of her touch
would be deemed unclean.

338
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,152
- She was an outcast of society.
- Like me.

339
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,990
But one day, Jesus came to preach...

340
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,837
and the woman suddenly reached out
as he passed...

341
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,036
and touched the hem of his garment.

342
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,113
She was one of the only people
in the crowd who had faith in him.

343
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,468
And her bleeding instantly stopped.

344
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,637
And Jesus said to her,
"Be of good comfort.

345
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,914
"Thy faith has made thee whole. "

346
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,877
That's a good story.

347
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,391
Is it a story, Agatha?

348
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,078
I'm not making it up.

349
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,518
No one believes me.

350
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,954
I feel like Jesus.

351
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,711
And I feel like the woman
who needs a miracle.

352
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,389
Please.

353
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,949
I want to believe in you, Agatha.

354
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,432
I need to believe in something so badly.

355
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,359
You were right.

356
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,879
It's a boy.

357
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,839
All religious fanatics
have been certifiable.

358
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,958
A century ago, the surest way
to reach sainthood...

359
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,156
would be to suck pus from lepers.

360
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,993
Those people probably
weren't touched by the divine...

361
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,038
but by a major chromium deficiency.
You got an image?

362
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,595
Got it.

363
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,519
Now we have similar troubled souls...

364
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,911
in search of answers
who worship a prostitute.

365
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,277
These people need anti-depressants
not religion.

366
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,349
What? Is the sample compromised?

367
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,152
The sample's fine.

368
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,515
It's not Agatha's blood, Sean.

369
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,912
How's the bleeding?

370
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,679
It stopped.

371
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,029
- After I touched you?
- Yes.

372
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,791
Praise be to God.

373
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,358
Wherever she is.

374
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,472
Do you promise me they're not
sending me back to that county place?

375
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,710
You're coming with us, Agatha.

376
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,798
We've missed you.

377
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,560
I get to stay there for a while, right?

378
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,435
Yes. You have a safe haven, my dear.

379
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,233
I'll need the evidence
before I leave, please.

380
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,630
It's been requested
by a higher authority.

381
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,998
I won't feed into your frenzy. I'm sorry.
We won't release that information.

382
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,749
Because your science wasn't
strong enough to dispute faith?

383
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,959
That's fine.

384
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,239
<i>Proof of His existence will never
manifest itself through science.</i>

385
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,556
But He communicates through signs
in front of us every day, Dr. McNamara.

386
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,678
You just have to know how to read them.

387
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,158
Come with me, Agatha.

388
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,193
- I'm going to run her blood work again.
- I've already done it twice, Sean.

389
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,111
I'll run the antibody.

390
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,795
A Dr. Adams for you on Line 2.

391
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,559
Are you sure?

392
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,469
Are you?

393
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,354
Relax.

394
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,949
<i>Relax.</i>

395
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,271
We're going to begin now.

396
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,353
- How are they?
- They're scabbing up.

397
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,915
Good. That means they're healing.

398
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,675
I'm going to grab a beer,
and then let's go out for dinner.

399
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,637
It's been a rough day.

400
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,630
What's wrong?
Why was your day so tough?

401
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,470
The patient we're treating,
Agatha Ripp?

402
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,791
I've turned my office upside down,
and I can't find the instrument...

403
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,155
she's using to puncture herself.

404
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,831
Then we ran a blood test.

405
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,312
The blood coming out of her wound
isn't hers.

406
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,151
I know there's a reasonable explanation
behind all of this...

407
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,039
but it's bugging the shit out of me
that I can't pinpoint it.

408
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,872
It defies all logic.

409
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,792
Sometimes, Sean...

410
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,318
you have to be willing
to give in to the unknown.

411
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,878
No, I don't. I'm a doctor.
Every symptom has a cause.

412
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,354
How much do you believe in us, Sean?

413
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,269
- Honey, what's wrong?
- No, please. Answer me. I need to know.

414
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,598
I don't understand.

415
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,355
If you believe in us, Sean,
if you believe in our love the way I do...

416
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,870
then it can override everything,
even the truth.

417
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,752
The truth about what?

418
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,917
The truth about Matt.

419
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,313
Is he sick?

420
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,758
He's not your son.

421
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,351
What are you talking about?

422
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,158
I was there when he was conceived.
I pulled him out of you when he was born.

423
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,637
He's everything like me.

424
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,918
Too emotionally shut off.
He's too in his head.

425
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,358
This thing with Ava is completely
non-McNamara-like. I'll give you that.

426
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,755
Is that what you're trying to say?

427
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,037
- Is that what you're saying?
- I didn't mean...

428
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,589
Just answer me! I am Matt's father!

429
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,073
Christian is.

430
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,592
That's not true.

431
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,354
Christian and you
have never been together.

432
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,433
Matt looks like me! You're lying!

433
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,918
Why are you doing this to me?

434
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,878
Because I can't live with this any longer!

435
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,598
This is not true.

436
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,949
I slept with him once. One time.

437
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,915
When?

438
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,036
I went to him. I was afraid.

439
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,790
You said you loved me.
You said you wanted me.

440
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,076
I did. I do...

441
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,715
but it was 17 years ago,
when I was a girl...

442
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,791
and I'd only been with one man, you...

443
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,599
and I was terrified
that I was missing out on something.

444
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,991
- Stop talking, just shut your mouth!
- I have to say this!

445
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,151
I went to him. We had sex one time.

446
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,758
Christian would never do that to me.

447
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,753
- He's like my brother.
- I didn't know, Sean.

448
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,799
All these years, I didn't know.

449
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,554
And then I couldn't live
with the not knowing anymore...

450
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,472
and I took the test.

451
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,714
I love you! Only you.

452
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,390
All this time, it's been a lie?

453
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,114
- My life has been a lie?
- No, that's not true.

454
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,676
You get out of my house!

455
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,751
- Sean, please!
- You're weak.

456
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,196
You've always been weak. I gave you
my whole life to make you strong...

457
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,032
and I want you out!

458
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,433
Get out!

459
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,280
- We need to talk.
- About what?

460
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,589
If you want to go through this pregnancy
on your own, fine...

461
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,558
but when we have this child, I have rights.

462
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,480
I want to see it,
I want to spend time with it.

463
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,110
You can't shut me out forever, Liz.
That wasn't the arrangement.

464
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,839
There was no arrangement,
legal or otherwise.

465
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:25,198
There probably should've been,
but we were winging it.

466
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,715
Were?

467
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,159
You miscarried?

468
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,112
It wasn't a miscarriage.

469
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,112
You got rid of our baby
and you didn't tell me?

470
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,673
It's my body, Christian,
and it was going to be my burden.

471
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,516
So save me the lecture. I know you.

472
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,557
Cars, women, homes, babies.
You like everything pretty.

473
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,394
I hardly think
you'd be equally devoted to a child...

474
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,152
that everybody was going to stare at...

475
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,154
and not because it was cute,
but because it had a birth defect.

476
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,474
I would have loved that kid,
no matter what.

477
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,157
I would have helped you.

478
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,350
It would have been difficult,
but it would have been fine.

479
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,193
But I didn't have that faith, Christian.

480
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,110
I looked deep within myself,
and all I saw was doubt.

481
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,638
I didn't believe that I could take care
of a challenged child...

482
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,519
when I feel so challenged and conflicted.

483
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,076
The only faith I had at the end of the day...

484
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,029
was my gut feeling that I couldn't do it.

485
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,869
If you didn't want a co-parent...

486
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,636
who had equal say
in whether his kid lived or died...

487
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,516
why didn't you make it easier
on everybody...

488
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,636
and go to a goddamn sperm bank?

489
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,555
I wanted proof that my child
had at least one parent who was beautiful.

490
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,078
It makes life easier,
or haven't you noticed?

491
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,478
That's all I was to you,
a goddamn pretty face?

492
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,951
That's all you wanted from me?

493
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,269
A guarantee of beauty.

494
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,477
Something I so desperately wanted
and never had.

495
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,312
I'm ashamed to say it, but yes.

496
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,034
Sean, what are you doing? Sean, no!

497
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,238
I loved you the most.

498
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,677
What are you doing here?

499
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,391
I want to learn how to pray.

500
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,956
But you're not a believer.

501
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,599
All of the things I believed in were lies.

502
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,114
I need to put my faith
in things I dismissed, things I doubted.

503
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,115
Help me understand. Please.

504
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,635
You shouldn't have come for me.

505
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,389
I can't guide you. I can't.

506
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,677
But if anybody should have forsaken God,
it's you.

507
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,591
After what you've been through,
what you've seen.

508
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,791
Tell me how you didn't.

509
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,550
I did forsake him, a week ago.

510
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,314
But now...

511
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,951
look at all those people.

512
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,111
All here because of me...

513
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,032
their faith renewed.

514
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,791
But you were right from the beginning,
Dr. McNamara.

515
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,319
I'm a fraud.

516
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,471
It was the Sister's idea...

517
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,555
and Father Malley wasn't involved.

518
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,999
They were going to close this archdiocese
'cause of poor attendance.

519
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,755
Sister Rita Claire's programs,
they would all be over then.

520
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,992
So she talked to me.

521
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,198
She told me I could stay here
and be safe...

522
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,756
for as long as I wanted...

523
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,311
if I would let her do it.

524
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,354
So I did.

525
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,793
And now everybody gets what they want...

526
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,639
mostly them.

527
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,869
This going through life
with no faith in anything...

528
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,793
is the worst hell of all, don't you think?

529
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,152
So God bless them.

530
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,398
God bless them all.

531
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,238
You stabbed yourself?

532
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,958
I couldn't do it.

533
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,393
The Sister did it.

534
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,120
That one time you were in surgery,
it was planned.

535
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,713
She snuck in...

536
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,874
hammered the nail through my feet...

537
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,358
left her own blood.

538
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,798
Come along, Agatha.

539
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,833
I'm so sorry.

540
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,915
Please.

541
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,355
I need to believe in something.

542
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,918
Don't you get it?

543
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,034
There is nothing to believe in anymore.

544
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,510
