00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,871
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,995
What are you gonna do?

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,038
I'm not gonna walk away
over dumb shit like DNA.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,792
I want a face-lift.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,710
I think I work better on women
I've screwed.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,713
Once you've seen a woman's come face,
you've seen her soul.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,552
You slept with my mother.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,236
Stop hurting me because
you can't have me, Christian.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,310
Ms. Mabika, tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,875
My...

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,554
clitoris.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,472
- And the problem with it is?
- I want an orgasm.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,112
In America, on my modeling shoots,
I meet women who enjoy having sex.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,190
Sex, sex, sex. All the time.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,592
They do take a break every now and then.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,712
I was victim of female genital mutilation.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,316
<i>The daja, the midwife...</i>

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,989
she said I was the worst girl she ever cut...

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,790
because of all the screaming.

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,311
My mother had to sit on me
and hold my legs open...

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,553
while the witch sliced off my clitoris
with a sharp piece of glass.

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,509
And then she used it
to tear out the folds surrounding it.

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,957
I didn't think
this sort of thing still went on.

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,318
In Somalia,
over 90%/% of the women have it done.

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,515
It is a fatwa.

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,989
One of the 10 obligations
a woman must adhere to...

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,230
if she wishes to attain perfection.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,472
- And if you refuse?
- An uncut woman cannot marry.

29
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,954
She is considered masculine, unclean.

30
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,634
Sexual urges belong only to the male.

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,955
So I am asking you,
can you give me an orgasm?

32
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,275
That may not be possible.

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,949
But this is America. Anything is possible.

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,872
Anything, but not everything.

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,429
We can certainly reconstruct
your pudenda...

36
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,797
but as far as rebuilding a clitoris
and restoring sensation...

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,555
Well, actually, there is
an experimental procedure.

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,434
It's called a free flap transfer where
we take the tip from one of your toes...

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,397
and attach it to the clitoral area.

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,630
But it's only been tried a few times.

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,872
The chances for a successful graft
aren't optimal.

42
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,914
But if there is even a little chance...

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,235
please, Dr. McNamara...

44
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,431
what have I got to lose?

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,878
I came up with the idea, I'm doing it.
You can assist.

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,679
We're talking about
microsurgical free-tissue replantation.

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,558
It can't look pretty, it's gotta work.

48
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,836
You might be more adept
at nerve reattachment...

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,072
but I am a goddamn genius
when it comes to pussy.

50
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,436
If I build it, she will come.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,831
Then maybe we should let Liz operate.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,719
She knows more about the clitoris
than either of us.

53
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,677
I'm sorry,
I meant because you're a woman.

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,751
No, I know what you meant.

55
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,952
How can you read this
and remain unaffected?

56
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,914
Manya Mabika's
been hideously disfigured...

57
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,196
so that a man could use her
as a blow-up doll.

58
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,238
Do you think you could chuck
your male egos for a sec...

59
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,994
and pick the best surgeon for the job?

60
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,878
Right. What was I thinking? Okay. Call it.

61
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,349
Tails.

62
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,518
Congratulations.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,753
You wanna know anything,
I'm here for you.

64
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,753
Shit emergency.

65
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,873
Good morning to you, too.

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,079
I was down the block having breakfast
with my sponsor when I ran out of diapers.

67
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,232
Kid is a feces factory.
He's covered in shit up to his neck.

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,716
If this smell doesn't make you think twice
before having sex, nothing will.

69
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,919
You hear that, Wilber?

70
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,117
Mommy says you smell so bad
that she's closing down Fort Bushy.

71
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,508
Good job.

72
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,709
I know. It's not as much fun
as sitting in your own poop...

73
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,759
but someday you'll be able to pay some
beautiful lady to do this to you all day.

74
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,399
Yes, you will.

75
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,633
You're good.

76
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,115
I'm always so nervous
when I give him a bath.

77
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,750
If you relax, he'll relax. Here we go.

78
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,434
Look. All clean. What happened?

79
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,470
What happened to you?
You're all clean all of a sudden.

80
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,471
Come on, my little boy.

81
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,953
There you go. Okay, come on. Let's go.

82
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,468
It's cold.

83
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,189
Maybe we should have another one.

84
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,077
One that's both of ours.

85
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,599
That was great.

86
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,878
Mornings are best.

87
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,109
How soon does Annie go to college?

88
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,990
I should shower and get going.

89
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,834
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

90
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,873
I hope you're at least
fantasizing about me.

91
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,108
Of course.

92
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,153
Except you were younger, taller,
and looked a lot like Jude Law.

93
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,077
Excuse me. I'll leave the two of you alone.

94
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,949
Honey, I was just
helping myself to seconds.

95
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,678
I didn't get enough the first time around.

96
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,511
You didn't come with me, did you?

97
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,356
I'm just not...

98
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,358
having orgasms that easily right now.

99
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,673
But it has nothing to do with you.

100
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,479
Wow. I had no idea
you were such a good actress.

101
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,995
I wasn't acting. It all felt good.

102
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,071
Just not good enough.

103
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,800
I'm sorry. Maybe I should have told you.

104
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,793
It's me. I'm off. It's just a phase.

105
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,311
Maybe you should see someone.

106
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,632
I already have one therapist
under my roof. I don't need another one.

107
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,515
I'm just blocked. It'll be fine.

108
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,879
All right.

109
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,749
Sorry I'm late.

110
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,356
My son dropped the mother load
and then decided to finger-paint with it.

111
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,033
Sounds very special.

112
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,919
I'd love to stay and hear about
your son's bowel movement...

113
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,913
but the patient's been ready
for 20 minutes.

114
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,069
It's like I'm addicted to him or something.
He forces me to be in the moment.

115
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,915
You're on your hands and knees, trying
to get the stain out of a Chinese rug...

116
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,230
and the little bastard starts to laugh...

117
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,313
and that makes you laugh, and then
it dawns on you, you're happy.

118
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,474
Something matters. Wilber matters.

119
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,553
I don't wanna do it. I can't make her come.

120
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,116
Yes, you can.
Come on, it's a new procedure for us.

121
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,636
- It's natural to be nervous.
- I'm talking about Julia.

122
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,550
I went down on her this morning,
and I could have sworn I was in the zone.

123
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,713
- And what, she fell asleep?
- No, I caught her finishing what I'd started.

124
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,757
She says she's been faking it for months.

125
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,559
You can understand
how I'd be hesitant to reconstruct...

126
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,838
Ms. Mabika's genitalia when I have no idea
how my own wife's operates.

127
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,109
You ever tried doing the alphabet?

128
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,959
With your tongue?

129
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,315
- What are you, 12?
- Women are right brain.

130
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,392
They're instinctual, intuitive,
and, above all, verbal.

131
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,348
You wanna be a successful lover,
work on your language skills.

132
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,077
They're a mystery, you know.

133
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,631
I can reconstruct her external parts,
maybe even revitalize dying tissue.

134
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,357
But pleasure...

135
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,678
release, ecstasy...

136
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,878
All we're doing
is maximizing her potential.

137
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,792
She just wants a fighting chance
to feel, or at the very least...

138
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,270
to look like the woman she could've been
if she lived in this country...

139
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,159
instead of some place
where men are such pussies...

140
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,392
they have to neuter their women
to get a hard-on.

141
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,272
Let's go build a clitoris.

142
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,678
- What am I gonna do with you?
- I think he's had enough.

143
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,354
Come on, Mom. Five more minutes.

144
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,598
If he doesn't nap,
he will be up all night and so will I.

145
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,992
And if I don't sleep, then I can't be
my usual sunny self, all right?

146
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,954
Good job.

147
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,234
And here is your blankie.

148
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,672
You're a great dad.

149
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,232
Wilber adores you.

150
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,632
I want to adopt him.

151
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,956
I want to be his father legally.

152
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,759
Let's do it tomorrow.
We could check with a lawyer.

153
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,071
We could see how long it takes
for all the paperwork to become official.

154
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,753
This is perfect.

155
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,197
This way, you can be the father
to both our kids.

156
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,552
It's better for Wilber, and it's better for us.

157
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,193
I didn't say anything about another kid.

158
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,879
I know, but you implied.

159
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,555
Wilber. I didn't say anything
about having another baby.

160
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,078
With me, you mean.

161
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,959
You don't wanna have
another kid with me.

162
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,479
Two is a lot more work than one.

163
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,712
I don't think it's the best thing
for you either, not in your state.

164
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,518
My state?
What are you, a goddamn shrink?

165
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,272
Honey, calm down.

166
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,355
The only reason you want another baby
is to fill up that void inside of you.

167
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,273
One isn't quite doing it. Maybe two will.

168
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,669
You're an addict, Gina.

169
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,400
Only this time,
instead of craving sex or drugs...

170
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,949
you're trying to fill
that bottomless void with babies.

171
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,109
Listen to me, asshole.

172
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,316
You don't wanna have
another baby with me, fine!

173
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,199
There are a thousand men
who could make a better dad than you.

174
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,512
I could find better spunk
off a shit-stained urinal in a strip joint.

175
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,599
- Where are you going?
- You can forget about being a father!

176
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,309
There is no way in hell
I am gonna let you adopt my baby!

177
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,872
You're not gonna keep him from me.

178
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,472
I know you're pissed because I won't
have another baby with you...

179
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,232
but you're not taking it out on Wilber.

180
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,675
You're right. I'm taking it out on you.

181
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,400
Don't test me, Gina. You'll regret it.

182
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,710
You think you can do this on your own?

183
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,996
I don't need your filthy money.
I could get work.

184
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,436
Doing what? You never finished college,
you've got no references.

185
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,830
You want me out of the picture?
Just say the word.

186
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,673
You can go back to your shitty houseboat.

187
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,949
Fine.

188
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,117
You can have him this Friday,
from 6:00 to 9:00.

189
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,152
Take it or leave it.

190
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,393
- You got a hot date?
- You might say that.

191
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,357
You can't run away, Elias.
You have to run toward.

192
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,314
I'm sorry.

193
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,713
I changed my mind.

194
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,156
That's okay, Mr. Perri.
Come back when you're ready.

195
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,119
Mrs. Perri.

196
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,550
I'm not Elias' wife, Dr. McNamara.
I'm his life coach.

197
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,637
We're working together to overcome
self-defeating patterns...

198
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,917
that keep him
from experiencing self-fulfillment.

199
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,750
That's it, Elias. Way to go.

200
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,993
I don't want to minimize the trauma
of male pattern baldness...

201
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,115
No.

202
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,280
Forgive me, Mr. Perri. I didn't realize.

203
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,750
Were you born with this condition
or was it acquired through an illness?

204
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,990
This is the way God made me.

205
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,719
Rugged, huh?

206
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,873
Smooth as a baby's bottom. All over.

207
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,595
Mr. Perri, with alopecia universalis...

208
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,150
there are no live hair follicles
to graft and transplant.

209
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,548
I knew it.

210
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,230
There's nothing anyone can do.

211
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,875
But we could have the lab
match you with a donor...

212
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,713
and do a follicular graft
on the pubic and underarm areas...

213
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,438
and hope the match isn't rejected.

214
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,795
- What if it is?
- It'll fall out.

215
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,676
Great. How am I supposed to get hard...

216
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,274
if I'm thinking about
the hair on my balls falling out?

217
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,432
Then don't think about it.
At least you'll have tried.

218
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,956
You didn't just sit back and wait
for change to happen. You demanded it.

219
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,636
Which brings you one step closer to
your goal, having more pleasure in life.

220
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,317
- When's your next opening?
- Congratulations, Elias.

221
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,798
Why don't you see our receptionist,
and she'll check our availability?

222
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,788
Thank you.

223
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,078
Excuse me, Ms. Moore.

224
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,432
Do you have a minute?

225
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,916
I'll be with you in a sec.

226
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,596
This is kind of awkward,
especially considering...

227
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,593
I'd never heard of a life coach
before you walked in here today.

228
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,320
It's a growing alternative,
a good one, I think...

229
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,712
for those of us who have spent too many
years on a couch and still aren't happy.

230
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,675
I was wondering if you had any openings
in your schedule.

231
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,194
- I could see you...
- It's not for me.

232
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,592
I'd like you to talk to my wife.

233
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,951
"I tend to be optimistic. "

234
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,509
Accurate, somewhat accurate,
or inaccurate?

235
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,999
Somewhat accurate.

236
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,675
I think I did this test
the last time I had my roots done.

237
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,353
"I'm physically affectionate. "

238
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,034
Well, I've never been much of a hugger.

239
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,589
She had acute haphephobia
till she was 11.

240
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,637
You know, the fear of being touched.

241
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,360
Or didn't they cover that at Life Coach U?

242
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,829
- Mother, please.
- Ava doesn't mind a few questions.

243
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,070
After all, she's trying to become
your therapist.

244
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,674
I'm not trying to become a therapist.

245
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,594
As a matter of fact, I don't believe in it.
It focuses on the imaginary wounds...

246
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,116
that keep people from progressing
'cause they're so busy picking at them.

247
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,115
As a practicing therapist with a Ph. D.
in Clinical Psychology from Columbia...

248
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,953
let me assure you, the wounds are real...

249
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,113
and if you pretend they don't exist
and slap a bandage on them...

250
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,870
you'll wind up with
a case of pus-oozing gangrene.

251
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,915
- Look, it's getting late...
- No pus.

252
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,072
- Sorry?
- Gangrene occurs from...

253
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,438
a lack of blood supply to the tissues.
It's anaerobic, so there's no pus.

254
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,391
Or didn't they cover that at Columbia?

255
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,193
I guess that took the wind out of my sails.

256
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,190
I'll go study up on pus...

257
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,029
and leave you girls to your quiz.

258
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,670
- Your mother's a bitch.
- She's having a rough time. My father...

259
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,037
Blah, blah, blah. Get rid of her.
She's a vampire.

260
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,471
She's attached herself to your neck,
and she's sucking the life blood out of you.

261
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,598
Listen, I know it's weird,
my being introduced by your husband...

262
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,479
and it's fine if you don't want a life coach...

263
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,076
but I can't leave
until you promise to send her packing.

264
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,636
- She's not your friend.
- I'm her daughter.

265
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,314
You're her blood supply. It's her or you.

266
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,317
And she's had her turn.

267
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,550
You take care of yourself, okay?

268
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,674
Ava...

269
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,670
I'm willing to give it a go.

270
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,110
You are gonna get more from life
than you ever dreamed.

271
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,236
And we're gonna start
with that sexual problem of yours.

272
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,232
What are you talking about?

273
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,836
Sean told me you couldn't come
when he went down on you.

274
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,069
Ms. Mabika. How are you today?

275
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,392
Well, according to my mother,
I am immoral and unclean...

276
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,118
and have made myself vulnerable
to disease, drug use, and promiscuity.

277
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,877
I got the same letter
when I went away to college.

278
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,078
I'm gonna take a look,
if that's okay with you.

279
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,433
Could you scoot down for me a little bit?

280
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,798
That's it. Just a little further. There we go.

281
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,559
Okay, I'm gonna stimulate the clitoris
and check for blood flow.

282
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,154
Stop me if you feel any discomfort.

283
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,993
It doesn't hurt.

284
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,635
Good.

285
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,636
All right, you can sit up.

286
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,191
You're healing...

287
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,914
very well.

288
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,518
Can I have sex soon?

289
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,752
What's the hurry?

290
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,112
Hurry? I've been waiting 10 years.

291
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,796
I think that's very patient.

292
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,069
You might wanna take it slow,
not have too many expectations.

293
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,754
I would hate to see you disappointed.

294
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,233
I know what to expect, Doctor.

295
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,910
A man who has lost his sight,
he's not without vision.

296
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,949
He's lost the use of his eyes, yes...

297
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,954
but he still distinguishes shapes
and distances in his own way.

298
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,714
The same is true of one's genitalia.

299
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,918
I mean, I have never climaxed,
that's true...

300
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,559
but my body still tingles...

301
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,718
when I run my fingers lightly
up and down my arm...

302
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,596
or when I caress my breasts...

303
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,198
and my nipples.

304
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,838
I, too, have vision.

305
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,634
As they say,
one who has vision can achieve it.

306
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,515
Dr. McNamara, he is a great doctor...

307
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,672
but you, Dr. Troy...

308
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,195
I sense in you a true healer.

309
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,439
Are you a true healer, Dr. Troy?

310
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,512
Will you heal me?

311
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,794
It doesn't mean
that the surgery wasn't successful.

312
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,510
It's still too early to tell.

313
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,756
- It's just not working.
- I don't care how long it takes.

314
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,469
We're both just trying too hard.

315
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,073
Honey, it's not that
what you were doing didn't feel good.

316
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,359
It felt great.

317
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,234
It's not a problem you could fix.

318
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,951
I could if you'd let me.

319
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,430
If I could let you, it wouldn't be a problem.

320
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,152
I hope you didn't make lunch plans.
I'm squeezing Manya in at 1:00.

321
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,710
- I think we should both be there.
- You told me she was healing nicely.

322
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,393
I did a follow-up.

323
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,074
She should be experiencing
more sensitivity by now.

324
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,470
Maybe the coaptation failed.
We need to explore it.

325
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,950
She was released less than 48 hours ago.
When did you do this follow-up?

326
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,348
Yesterday.

327
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,071
Night. She asked me to.

328
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,994
- To what, be an asshole?
- Look, the point is it isn't working, okay?

329
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,913
I spent a good 30 minutes
doing the entire Gettysburg Address.

330
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,308
In Somali?

331
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,595
The procedure is rare.

332
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,274
This has nothing to do with
your competence as a surgeon.

333
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,634
Or your technique as a lover.

334
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,509
- Which has a success rate of 100%/%.
- Try 90%/%. It didn't work with Julia.

335
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,194
I went through the goddamn alphabet
three times.

336
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,153
- All I can say is it's always worked for me.
- Till Manya Mabika.

337
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,039
Besides, what makes you so sure
the others weren't faking it?

338
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,872
Julia had me fooled.

339
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,073
- I can tell the difference.
- No, you can't. No man can tell.

340
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,151
We'll never really know
what gets them off...

341
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,880
like they'll never know
what it's like to have a hard-on.

342
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,315
It's like trying to describe the sky
to a blind man.

343
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,710
We're just groping in the dark.

344
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,155
The pubic and axilla areas
are marked and prepped.

345
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,390
Just didn't know how low
you wanted to graft.

346
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,996
Mr. Perri, I can't tell you how happy I am
that you're a man.

347
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,072
At least I know my way around a penis.
Hit it.

348
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,355
There's no evidence of fibrosis on
the smooth muscle tissue of the clitoris...

349
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,748
or the vaginal wall.

350
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,672
Let us know
as soon as you feel something.

351
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,478
If it's too intense...

352
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,513
Can you feel that?

353
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,874
A little.

354
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,958
The way you feel your tooth
after the dentist gives you Novocain.

355
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,833
How about that?

356
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,032
- Maybe she's not ready yet.
- We should be seeing some signs by now.

357
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,475
Vaginal lubrication,
clitoral and labial engorgement.

358
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,236
Excuse me, Doctors, but there is a patient
on the other end of that speculum.

359
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,357
Manya, this is a biothesiometer.

360
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,115
It measures the sensitivity of the skin
to high and low-frequency vibration.

361
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,794
We use it to determine
the sensitivity of the clitoris.

362
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,393
For God's sake.

363
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,719
Listen, do you think Manya and I
could have a minute to confer?

364
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,834
Absolutely.

365
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,754
Speculum?

366
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,197
You know, cells have a memory,
and when we've had a trauma...

367
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,040
our nerves shut down to protect us...

368
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,675
from re-experiencing the pain.

369
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,675
So...

370
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,275
you think my body's protecting me
from pleasure as well?

371
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,718
Before we can let someone
touch us there...

372
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,679
we have to let them touch us here.

373
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,470
Perhaps I'm more afraid than I thought.

374
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,393
You won't be
when you find the right lover.

375
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,559
Meet Ms. Right.

376
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,636
That girl? No.

377
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,678
- She knows nothing about making love.
- She knows you. What you like...

378
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,871
what it feels like...

379
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,079
to have your fingertips
rub across your belly...

380
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,752
around your thighs...

381
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,230
and into your sacred center.

382
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,153
Feel the energy pulsing through you...

383
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,838
as you touch and tease yourself...

384
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,040
back and forth...

385
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,190
faster and slower...

386
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,838
harder and softer.

387
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,717
We have to remember we're treating
a human being, not just a vagina.

388
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,394
It's easy to forget
after a year with Vagina Gina.

389
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,875
Houston, we have liftoff.

390
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,796
She rubbed her magic lantern,
and set the genie free.

391
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,197
Congratulations, Doctor.

392
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,234
Wow. I feel like
I should be congratulating you.

393
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,557
You connected the circuitry,
I just helped her turn it on.

394
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,792
She's waiting for you.
She'd like to say thanks.

395
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,119
Don't let this crush your ego.
You can't win them all.

396
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,273
She told me you tried.
I was appalled until she told me she asked.

397
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,717
I didn't know she was gay.

398
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,792
Because you didn't get her off,
she must be gay?

399
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,111
You really have no idea
what goes on inside a woman.

400
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,829
You know, I think I've been inside
enough of them to have some idea.

401
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,195
Evolve a little, why don't you?

402
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,109
You wanna get inside of a woman,
stop thinking like a dick.

403
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,593
Sorry, I...

404
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,070
Liz told me everything was...

405
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,909
- I can come back another time.
- No.

406
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,716
Please stay.

407
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,829
It was so beautiful.

408
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,680
Well, I'm glad you're happy.

409
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,513
It's natural to feel emotional
after experiencing a release.

410
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,470
A release? Yes, it was.

411
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,789
It was like God
was waking up inside of me.

412
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,678
I've never heard it described
quite like that.

413
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,673
At first, I was afraid.

414
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,998
It was as they said.

415
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,596
I was protecting myself...

416
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,839
but then...

417
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,239
such joy.

418
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,270
The body's incredibly resilient.

419
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,192
It is nothing compared to the soul.

420
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,315
Now, anything is possible.

421
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,358
Even forgiveness.

422
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,959
I forgive them, Dr. McNamara.

423
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,992
I forgive them all.

424
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,999
I'm whole now.

425
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,874
I'm free.

426
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,714
Now watch Mommy's face.
Flowers are magic.

427
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,032
As soon as a woman sees them,
she forgets all about how angry she is.

428
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,837
Smart. Start them young.

429
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,429
You gonna watch Daddy
park the pink bus in the fur garage?

430
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,870
She is one cranky hot bitch.

431
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,830
You wait here, little buddy.
Daddy'll be right back.

432
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,237
- What the hell are you doing?
- You're early.

433
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,235
God, I thought you were taking Wilber
to the zoo and then to dinner.

434
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,833
Come already.

435
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,596
Get the hell out of here.

436
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,399
- I said get your shit and get out of here!
- Cool off, man.

437
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,596
Thank you for your deposit, Gil.

438
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,593
What are you, on drugs?
You organized your own gangbang?

439
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,991
They are my gang, asshole,
from Sexaholics Anonymous.

440
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,798
It's a good cause. They volunteered.

441
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,155
To do what?
Jump off the wagon and onto you?

442
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,949
It's called heterospermic insemination.
It's the surest way to get pregnant.

443
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,678
The more partners, the more sperm...

444
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,150
the more competitive
the little bastards are to come in first.

445
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,515
Wilber's gonna have a brother
with or without you.

446
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,398
You are so goddamn sick.

447
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,552
What is your problem, asshole?
They've all been tested.

448
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,632
There's not so much as a herpes
in the bunch.

449
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,758
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm getting Wilber out of here.

450
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,992
You've got no right.
There is no biological or legal connection...

451
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,549
between the two of you,
and there's no law against...

452
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,632
having sex with multiple partners
or you would be on death row.

453
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,395
Right. When I sue you for custody,
you be sure to say that!

454
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,432
He's blissed out.

455
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,318
Great, huh, buddy?

456
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,640
It's what's called maternal instinct.

457
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,510
I didn't know where else to go.

458
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,190
It's been a long time
since I've held a baby like this.

459
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,233
Brings back all those nights
with Matt and Annie.

460
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,356
That silent communication.

461
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,590
So uncomplicated.

462
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,313
So intimate.

463
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,077
Sometimes feels more intimate
than anything else.

464
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,755
Maybe you could help me with him.

465
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,596
Just until this thing with Gina
is resolved, until I get custody.

466
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,432
- What if you don't?
- I will.

467
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,795
No judge is gonna deem her competent.

468
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,475
I think it would be great for Wilber
to have someone like you in his life...

469
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,993
someone so...

470
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,074
nurturing.

471
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,714
I don't know.

472
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,713
Whenever I'm out,
and I see parents my age with babies...

473
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,599
I just feel relief. It's too much work.

474
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,833
- I've already done it twice.
- Not with me.

475
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,993
It could be fun, raising a kid together.

476
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,873
What about Sean?

477
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,032
You mean Uncle Sean?

478
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,833
- He'll be part of the family, too.
- I thought I heard a baby.

479
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,471
Isn't he adorable?

480
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,760
Darling, I hope you don't mind
my borrowing your sweater.

481
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,038
I needed color to accent my face.
My editor's taking me out to lunch.

482
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,549
I didn't realize
doctors still made house calls.

483
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,599
- How nice of you, Christian.
- Hello, Erica. How are you healing?

484
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,474
Beautifully. Like it never happened.

485
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,038
This must be Wilber.

486
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,869
- Your girlfriend's baby.
- He's mine.

487
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,157
Yes, I can see the resemblance.

488
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,596
Don't let him fall asleep with that bottle.
He'll start depending on it.

489
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,514
- Maybe he finds it comforting.
- He should learn to fall asleep on his own.

490
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,478
He'll be more self-reliant without a crutch.

491
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,831
You know what? I'd be happy to help you.

492
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,673
- Call whenever you need me.
- Help him what?

493
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,594
I just asked Julia
to help me take care of Wilber.

494
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,553
Isn't that nice, sweetheart?
It'll be like giving it another shot.

495
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,595
There he is. Hey.

496
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,312
Mommy misses you.
Mommy loves you. Yeah.

497
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,991
What the hell do you want?

498
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,879
There's someone I thought
you should meet.

499
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,469
Christian Troy, James Sutherland.

500
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,598
Wilber's father.

501
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,713
His real one.

502
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,232
<i>Frances gave the galleys of my book
to The New York Times.</i>

503
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,391
Apparently, they loved it.

504
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,119
You're pouting.

505
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,876
Are you angry because
I think you're making a mistake?

506
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,590
What mistake am I making this time,
Mother? I'll add it to the list.

507
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,719
The one where you insist on putting
everyone else's needs ahead of your own.

508
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,599
- Aren't you getting bored with it?
- I don't do that.

509
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,955
Volunteering to take care
of Christian's child.

510
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,873
- I happen to have the time.
- No, you don't.

511
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,509
When are you going to step it up, darling?

512
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,398
Do you think sacrificing your potential...

513
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,676
for Christian's bastard
is in your best interests?

514
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,831
You don't give a shit
about my best interests.

515
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,151
All you think about is yourself.
Don't give me that patronizing look.

516
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,436
I'm not one of your patients.

517
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,630
I am not to blame for the way
your life has turned out.

518
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,558
You never wanted me to succeed, did you?

519
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,274
It's too much competition.

520
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,590
Is that why I pushed you
to have a career...

521
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,069
to put off marriage
till you'd established yourself?

522
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,673
Because I was competitive?

523
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,231
Is that all you care about?
How big my career is?

524
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,198
God, Mother, when you look at me,
is that all you see, what I'm not?

525
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,713
- You disappoint me, Julia.
- Consistency's what counts.

526
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,997
I raised you
to confront your feelings honestly...

527
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,674
to tell the truth about yourself to yourself.

528
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,515
The truth according to you, Mother!
You wanna hear my truth?

529
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,872
You won't let me succeed if you haven't.

530
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,433
I can't be in a loving relationship
when yours failed so miserably.

531
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,394
I can't possibly
have raised children who love me...

532
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,949
when yours can't stand you!

533
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,554
Is that why you're in love with Christian?

534
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,712
Because your marriage
is succeeding so brilliantly?

535
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,030
- What?
- Come on. I saw how you looked at him.

536
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,156
Why else would you wanna
raise the child?

537
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,675
Because you loved mothering
the first time around?

538
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,479
He's been one of my closest friends
for over 20 years.

539
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,438
And you've been in love with him
for all this time.

540
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,672
Hey. Christian call you?

541
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,753
He had some question
he wanted to ask you about Wilber.

542
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,469
I don't know how he's gonna manage
on his own.

543
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,476
- What's going on?
- Nothing...

544
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,393
except that my mother is leaving tonight.

545
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,030
- Are you sure you...
- She doesn't have a say in the matter.

546
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,713
I want her out.

547
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,516
I think it is for the best.

548
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,674
Unless Sean would like to hear
what we're talking about.

549
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,030
I'm sure he would be interested.

550
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,074
I'm not.

551
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,791
Whatever problems Julia's having
with you are hers to solve.

552
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,750
All I can do is support her...

553
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,350
and drive you to the airport.

554
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,630
No faking it that time, huh?

555
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,675
No.

556
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,471
That was extraordinary.

557
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,312
Ava was right.

558
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,076
I came when my mother went.

559
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,477
Boy, it was like something inside you
just woke up.

560
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,956
I've never heard you so...

561
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,709
free.

562
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,750
English
