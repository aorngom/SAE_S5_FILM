00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,916
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,035
We lie, Sean.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,794
We keep secrets in order
to protect the people that we love.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,235
Just answer me! I am Matt's father!

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,389
Christian is.

6
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,913
Get out of my house!

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,311
You've always been weak. I gave you
my whole life to make you strong...

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,799
and I want you out!

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,474
Sean, what are you doing? Sean, no!

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,038
I loved you the most.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,914
I have to agree with Sean.

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,514
<i>Your turning out to be the father
of his teenage son...</i>

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,717
will trigger the force majeure clause
of the partnership agreement.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,235
Certainly a cataclysmic
and unforeseen event.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,914
That was 17 years ago.
Before we even signed that contract.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,036
There must be a statute of limitations.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,158
There's no statue of limitations
on being a backstabbing asshole.

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,595
After what you did
how could I ever trust you again?

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,513
With a lot of hard work,
on both of our parts.

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,992
Yes, I screwed up. So did Julia,
but we were 23. We were just kids.

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,149
You're my brother, Sean.

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,198
Brothers don't sleep
with each other's wives.

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,795
Dr. Bahar is the best couples' therapist
in Miami.

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,117
He specializes in business partnerships
on the rocks.

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,592
Our business isn't on the rocks,
it's smashed to hell, mast to rudder.

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,714
What about a cooling-off period?
Before we do something rash and stupid.

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,438
I don't want to cool off.

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,990
I want you to box up your office
and get the hell out of my life.

29
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,914
Fine, but it won't be a mole removal.

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,594
You want out? It's gonna get invasive.

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,157
I get custody of the furniture
I picked out for the waiting room...

32
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,356
the anesthesia machine, Liz.

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,830
That machine is worth over $90,000.
You can't have it and Liz.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,433
May I speak frankly?

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,910
Right now, you each net
over $1.4 million a year.

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,793
Split up, you'd be lucky
to earn half that, combined.

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,472
Business breakups are oftentimes more
devastating and ugly than a marital split.

38
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,754
Loyal and grapevine clients
are likely to get confused.

39
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,717
Which doctor is the better one?

40
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,395
<i>Patients end up going somewhere else
for fear of choosing the wrong doctor.</i>

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,155
Apart, you guys are nowhere near
as strong as you are together.

42
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,878
Not at this phase of your lives.

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,554
- That's not something I'm worried about.
- You should be.

44
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,996
You think patients will travel
from all over the state to visit you...

45
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,118
in your office with your birds of paradise
and faux marble tiles?

46
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,236
It'll be easier for me to find a decorator...

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,153
than for you to find a doctor
who will carry your dead weight.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,110
If you're irreconcilable, I suggest you both
list the company's assets independently...

49
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,350
and we'll divide things
as amicably as possible.

50
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,272
What about surgeries
already on the books?

51
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,590
I've cancelled everything
past this afternoon...

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,830
except the Rosenberg case next week.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,230
Of course. Keep the one pro bono
on the docket.

54
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,279
It's a high profile case. The good publicity
will boost both our future practices.

55
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,228
I've seen your work over the last 10 years.
You'll need all the help you can get.

56
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,310
I'm not going.

57
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,233
This operation requires
two plastic surgeons.

58
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,038
Lives are at stake.

59
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,557
Or do you wanna destroy
more than you already have?

60
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,394
What is my severance?
I feel I'm owed that.

61
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,118
You're not gonna be out of work, Liz.

62
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,589
We'd like to offer you a position
in our new practices.

63
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,274
You're McNamara/Troy's
most valuable asset.

64
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,436
Computers and carpets are assets.

65
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,717
I'm a person with feelings,
who thinks being shot for both of you...

66
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,317
entitles her to an explanation.
What is all this drama about?

67
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,118
Christian slept with Julia.

68
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,918
17 years ago.

69
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,069
Before they were married.

70
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,357
Nine months before Matt was born.
You do the math.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,275
I am so sorry, Sean.

72
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,552
Are you all right?

73
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,556
Julia and I have started
the initial separation phase.

74
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,794
You have until we get back from New York
to decide which one you'd rather work for.

75
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,111
We both know it's not in your character
to choose an immoral traitor.

76
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,192
Just because Liz and I
dip into viciousness every now and then...

77
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,316
- doesn't mean we don't love each other.
- Stop.

78
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,438
I've been with the two of you
since you framed your first nickel.

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,478
So has Linda, and half the people
who work here.

80
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,596
You're not just dismantling a business.

81
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,149
You're dismantling a family.

82
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,477
I'm not saying you need
to forgive and forget.

83
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,553
I am just asking you to consider
everything you're giving up.

84
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,076
I'm not giving up anything
that hasn't already been taken away.

85
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,878
We'll be finished
with the Rosenberg case next week.

86
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,076
Make your decision by then.

87
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,637
Where's Annie gonna stay
when you're gone?

88
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,394
With her. It's only three days.

89
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,634
I left lunch and dinner money
on your nightstand.

90
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,189
No parties and no girls in our bed.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,115
My bed.

92
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,038
I'm late for school.

93
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,073
Matt, please sit down.

94
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,115
- I wanna talk to you.
- There's nothing to say.

95
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,670
You haven't been able to look me
in the eye since you found out.

96
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,918
You are my father.

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,069
Not him.

98
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,271
Is that what you wanted to hear?

99
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,315
Yes.

100
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,316
- When's Mom coming back?
- She's not.

101
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,152
- She wants to.
- I don't care.

102
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,833
I'm upset with her, too, now...

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,309
but I want to believe
you're a bigger man that this.

104
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,515
I'm not.

105
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,795
You know...

106
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,953
Nobody stopped to ask me,
"Matt, are you okay? How are you doing?"

107
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,112
That's bullshit. I tried to talk to you.
You wouldn't open up.

108
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,512
That's right, because retreating,
feeling dead and closing off...

109
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,830
that I got from you, Dad.

110
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,434
What's happened
between the three of you...

111
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,910
is painful, but we can fix this.

112
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,878
Your mother slept with my best friend
and you were the result...

113
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,554
and I didn't know for 17 years,
so stop defending them...

114
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,076
And my mother is sleeping in a hotel
because you kicked her out...

115
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,518
I can hear you crying through the walls
at night, so don't you dare scream at me!

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,433
Have a nice trip.

117
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,432
<i>Final boarding
call for Flight 714 to New York.</i>

118
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,155
Economy?

119
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,232
You know when the last time was
I flew anything but first class?

120
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,628
I could give a shit.

121
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,633
The university made arrangements.
I called about other flights.

122
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,995
None of them
would've gotten us there on time.

123
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,276
We're already late as it is.

124
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,751
Would you mind sitting between us?

125
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,194
Do you love her?

126
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,080
I'm not gonna play this game with you.

127
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,798
You owe me answers.

128
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,994
Do you love her?

129
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,509
Yes.

130
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,510
Like I love you. You're my family.

131
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,712
Does she love you?

132
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,429
No.

133
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,717
Did she come with you?

134
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,078
We came together.

135
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,357
Do you wanna be with her now?

136
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,719
I've thought about it.

137
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,269
Do you think Matt looks like you?

138
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,435
Yes.

139
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,715
<i>This is the captain speaking.
I'd like to thank your for flying with us.</i>

140
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,429
<i>Flight attendants, please prepare
for landing. Thank you.</i>

141
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,792
When you masturbate,
do you ever think about her?

142
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,715
Yes.

143
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,470
Did you ask her not to marry me?

144
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,869
No.

145
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,233
Did you want to?

146
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,915
Yes.

147
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,675
<i>It's a bare-bones operation
here this week.</i>

148
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,796
I apologize in advance
for the accommodations.

149
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,757
- Which are?
- Like all our surgical teams...

150
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,229
you'll be sharing a room
in the dormitories.

151
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,392
The university has donated room
and board for the doctors and media.

152
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,913
I'm sorry. That's not acceptable.

153
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,119
With the toy fair convention
in town, that's really the only choice...

154
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,998
unless you made advance reservations.

155
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,038
Your sacrifice of time
and amenities will be well worth it.

156
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,031
This is an historic surgery.

157
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,715
The Rosenbergs are the oldest individuals
to undergo this type of procedure.

158
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,713
An historic surgery, all right.
This'll be the last operation...

159
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,475
- of the McNamara/Troy partnership.
- We're going to pursue separate interests.

160
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,959
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

161
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,793
For the true talent,
a split usually proves to be a boon.

162
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,633
- Like after the Lennon-McCartney split.
- We got Wings.

163
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,155
<i>John Lennon, the true visionary,
recorded Imagine...</i>

164
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,357
<i>- and Double Fantasy, singular classics.
- And here we are.</i>

165
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,556
Dr. Troy, Dr. McNamara.

166
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,754
I'd like you to meet
Rose and Raven Rosenberg.

167
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,108
Hi.
HI.

168
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,079
You're late.

169
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,999
I'd like to introduce you all
to Rose and Raven's mother, Rachel.

170
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,075
Hi.

171
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,715
I would like to thank you all so much
for donating your time and support.

172
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,593
<i>I asked Dr. Atherton
to call this meeting today...</i>

173
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,832
to give you the opportunity
to get to know Raven and Rose...

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,878
the way I know them,
to see the things about them...

175
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,076
that CAT scans and MRIs don't show.

176
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,279
Even though they're physically
and emotionally connected...

177
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,149
I want you to know my daughters
as the individuals they are.

178
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,353
Feel free to ask any questions you like.

179
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,238
Hi. Dr. Avery Atherton, neurosurgery.

180
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,437
<i>I know your nerve endings are separate,
but a little I'm unclear...</i>

181
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,433
as to how the sensation
is interpreted in your brains.

182
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,479
For instance, if Raven hurts herself,
do you feel it, Rose?

183
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,632
We share tissue and bone, not feelings.

184
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,192
That's great. Thanks.

185
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,749
Dr. Carrie Kozinn, ear, nose and throat.

186
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,759
How do you handle your personal needs?

187
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,510
I shower every morning.
Rose likes her bath at night.

188
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,198
How is it that Rose
isn't in the shower with you?

189
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,998
We put the shower curtain between us.

190
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,674
Yes, they're not just lines, it's true.

191
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,068
Thank you.

192
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,515
Hello. Dr. Sheelen Jeevan,
micro-neurovascular surgeon.

193
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,717
What if one of you is tired
and the other isn't?

194
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,513
I go to bed.
Yeah.

195
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,748
We go to bed.

196
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,593
The other one will lay there
and read or do something.

197
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,796
And the other one will sleep.

198
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,236
What about intimate relations?
Do you have boyfriends?

199
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,960
I had a boyfriend,
but we had to break up.

200
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,712
Raven couldn't stand him.

201
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,669
But Raven is my best friend...

202
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,195
so I had to put her feelings first.

203
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,952
I see. Thank you.

204
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,995
Dr. Christian Troy, plastic surgeon.

205
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,991
He's cute.
Let me see.

206
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,357
We wanted to talk you
about what we're going to look like after.

207
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,953
How do you wanna look?

208
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,190
Sean McNamara, plastic surgeon.

209
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,430
As much alike as possible.

210
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,273
Have you thought
about what it'll be like to be separated?

211
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,113
Any fantasies about being alone
for the first time?

212
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,918
No.
No.

213
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,955
You must have at least considered it.
Dreamed about it?

214
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,315
The amazing sense
of freedom and release?

215
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,869
I had a dream
we were once separated...

216
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,238
then I got scared, and reached out
for Raven, but she wasn't there.

217
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,153
So, if you had the choice,
you'd stay together?

218
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,075
Of course. I hate my cancer.
I feel so guilty.

219
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,151
It's not your fault, Rose.

220
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,992
<i>I'm the one who feels guilty...</i>

221
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,958
because I'm not strong enough
to handle your chemo.

222
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,271
To you, being together looks hard.
But it's all we know.

223
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,155
I got a call from Kuram.

224
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,910
He said you missed
both your SAT tutorials this week.

225
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,715
So?

226
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,312
I pay Kuram $75 an hour for those classes.

227
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,150
Don't you mean Dad does?

228
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,397
Take your anger out on me
and not your future.

229
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,314
I don't want you regretting choices
you made at an emotional time...

230
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,436
for the rest of your life.

231
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,431
You are the expert on that.

232
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,554
I called you three times yesterday
to help me with my move.

233
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,676
You want me to help you
move out of our house...

234
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,076
because you destroyed our family.

235
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,430
Who the hell do you think you are?

236
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,230
Hey!

237
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,839
I am your mother, and I deserve
some goddamn consideration.

238
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,754
And all of this doesn't change
the fact that I love you...

239
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,912
and that I was the one up with you
and your colic for eight months.

240
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,311
I was the one cutting the ends
off your peanut-butter sandwiches.

241
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,837
I was the one who put my career
on hold so I could stay at home with you.

242
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,359
And all the while,
you knew it was one big lie.

243
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,117
I didn't know it then. I don't want
to know it now. Don't you see that?

244
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,191
No, Mom, I don't see that.

245
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,874
Fine. I'm a liar.

246
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,199
I'm the worst human being on the planet.

247
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,312
But one day...

248
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,514
you will realize that I was lying...

249
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,159
because I thought it was
what was best for you, and for your father.

250
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,470
I can't believe anything you say.

251
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,631
<i>Okay, I know I came out of your body...</i>

252
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,758
but I don't feel any connection
to you anymore.

253
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,594
Where are you going?
I'm going to Ava's.

254
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,751
You're seeing her again?

255
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,675
Yes.

256
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,273
At least I can trust her.
She's the only real adult in my life.

257
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,919
She's not an adult, Matt.

258
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,799
She's a parasite.
You have to trust me on this.

259
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,032
You don't own
the moral high ground anymore, Mom.

260
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,275
It's shocking. You'd think these girls
would be thrilled about being separated.

261
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,556
But they're questioning doing it at all.

262
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,234
They're just afraid of having
to face life on their own.

263
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,592
Or maybe they see that their individuality
shines brighter when they're together.

264
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,797
Cut the Hallmark bullshit.
I'm only in the same room with you...

265
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,871
because I need you
to be flawless tomorrow.

266
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,112
I can't operate on both girls at once.
Be professional or shut up.

267
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,679
Fine.

268
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,717
According to their CTs,
Rose doesn't have an eye socket.

269
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,233
We're gonna have to build one.

270
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,834
We'll need enough tissue
to sew the flap over the eye.

271
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,231
A prosthetic can be added
by someone else during rehabilitation.

272
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,109
How far do we inflate the skin expanders
when we can't measure her face?

273
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,829
If we are short on tissue,
we'll end up using free grafts.

274
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,197
All we need now is a bong
and a Flock of Seagulls album...

275
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,271
and we'd be right back
to where we started.

276
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,637
College was great.
Great for you.

277
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,429
You had all that free time to party
while I carried us through prerequisites.

278
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,318
You didn't carry me.

279
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,519
- We were a team, same as now.
- You have always been reliant on me.

280
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,592
And you on me. If not for me,
you wouldn't have had a social life.

281
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,034
<i>You wouldn't have met Julia.</i>

282
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,918
I think you're forgetting how we met.

283
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,992
You paid for my tray at the cafeteria,
and then begged me...

284
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,037
to tutor you up to a B in microbiology.

285
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,954
And that tutoring
bumped your A-minus to an A.

286
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,317
You have never appreciated
my contribution to this partnership.

287
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,314
We're symbiotic. Guiding me
gives you the motivation to excel.

288
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,870
You've got talent, but you never
would have had the nuts to express it...

289
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,678
without me
to compare yourself to.

290
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,910
I have your ineptitude
to thank for my success?

291
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,957
You have my 10-inch dick to thank.

292
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,509
<i>Surgery is the one place
you're more of a man than I am.</i>

293
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,558
You need to be better than me,
because in your twisted brain...

294
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,678
you think that's what keeps Julia.
So you work harder, you focus.

295
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,718
And that's why with all of your bullshit
about carrying me...

296
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,552
you've never been able to leave.

297
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,870
You couldn't do this without me.

298
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,198
- Where are you going?
- To study. Alone.

299
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,998
- What?
- I need your help with Matt.

300
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,435
Call his father.

301
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,797
Sean won't take my calls.
I need you to talk to Matt.

302
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,712
He's destroying his future.

303
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,275
He's upset. Let him process.

304
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,910
<i>That process is gonna land him
in Biscayne Community College.</i>

305
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,789
You know how important
junior year is for college admissions.

306
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,116
<i>He hasn't been to his SA Ttutor.</i>

307
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,919
<i>God knows if he's going to school, and...</i>

308
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,078
he's seeing Ava again.

309
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,358
I can't cut Sean's balls off right now.

310
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,351
I'll talk to him about it.

311
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,799
How is he?

312
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,789
Bad.

313
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,439
Talk to me about what?

314
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,160
Your son. He's not managing.

315
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,517
And Julia called you to help?
I guess the new era has begun.

316
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,079
She said you won't take her calls.

317
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,198
Bullshit. She's just playing us
off each other.

318
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,590
Fine, do it. Raise Matt.

319
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,435
I've spent years trying to corral
your bad genetics.

320
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,795
Let's see if you can do better.

321
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,838
Raven?

322
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,511
I'm scared. Sing to me.

323
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,389
<i>Hush, sweet Rose,
don't say a word</i>

324
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,429
<i>Sis is gonna buy you a mockingbird</i>

325
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,069
<i>And if that mockingbird don't sing</i>

326
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,833
All right, doctors,
let's make history.

327
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,758
How much room do you need?
A two-centimeter window.

328
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,229
That should be adequate.
You've got it.

329
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,516
Okay. Let's flip them.

330
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,192
All right, on the count of three.
One, two, three.

331
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,957
10-blade.
She's bleeding through.

332
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,235
Let's get suction.

333
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,595
I'm opening her.
Get a unit of blood.

334
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,194
Pressure's dropping.
Give her one milligram epi.

335
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,511
Start one unit of blood.
Unit of whole blood going in.

336
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,149
Shit. Suction.
Start a dopamine drip.

337
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,594
The sagittal sinus is blown.

338
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,639
Epi going in.
Rose's pressure is dropping.

339
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,390
Shit. Is she bleeding, too?
No. This doesn't make sense.

340
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,314
Flatline. Give atropine.

341
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,432
Giving one milligram atropine.

342
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,194
Disconnecting.
I'm breathing for Raven.

343
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,831
One milligram atropine in.

344
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,834
Let's get suction.
She's losing too much blood.

345
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,158
She's 80 over 50. Start dopamine.

346
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,834
I've got to open her up.
We're losing her.

347
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,109
One milligram atropine.

348
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,635
Still flatline.
She's bleeding out.

349
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,953
I'm calling it.

350
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,989
Time of death, 3:42 p. m.

351
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,559
Heart rate's 16 per minute.
Starting compressions.

352
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,598
Giving one milligram epi.
Good for fusion.

353
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,794
One milligram epi in.

354
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,997
There's no cranial bleed.
This shouldn't be happening.

355
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,749
She knows her sister's gone
and she's giving up.

356
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,754
She's not giving up.
She can survive on her own.

357
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,999
She can survive.

358
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,436
She can survive on her own.

359
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,110
Pressure's coming back.
68 over 48.

360
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,157
Heart rate's 45 and climbing.

361
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,993
You want me to leave the bottle?

362
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,674
Just keep pouring it till that's gone.

363
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,957
Business or personal?

364
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,469
I'm sorry?

365
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,119
Classy-looking guy like you ends up
drowning in Scotch on West 112th.

366
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,478
He's either just lost a big account
or his wife's screwing her personal trainer.

367
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,672
A little of both. Am I that obvious?

368
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,911
Depends on who's looking.

369
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,310
Rene.

370
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,669
Sean.

371
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,153
Can I buy you a drink? Apparently,
I now own the whole bottle.

372
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,313
We can share.

373
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,111
You wanna talk about it?

374
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,118
No. I'm tired of talking.

375
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,679
Let's just make trivial small talk, then.

376
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,512
What's your business, Sean?

377
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,518
What do you do?

378
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,272
Plastic surgeon.

379
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,832
Well, that's pretty cool.

380
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,752
Can I get your professional opinion
on something?

381
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,237
Should I get a boob job?

382
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,439
You already did.

383
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,031
- You're good.
- So are they.

384
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,512
- What?
- You're very beautiful.

385
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,997
- That's just the Scotch talking.
- Really. You remind me of somebody.

386
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,110
Somebody special I used to know.

387
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,393
You're sweet.

388
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,277
But you really don't need
to work so hard, baby.

389
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,309
How much?

390
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,550
Depends on what you want.

391
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,830
I just wanna make a connection.

392
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,873
Hi.

393
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,909
Hi.

394
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,390
You needed to take a piss, honey?
The restroom's right in there.

395
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,715
Thanks.

396
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,993
What are you doing?

397
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,109
Getting laid.

398
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,471
What's it look like I'm doing?

399
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,392
Where'd you get the weed?

400
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,711
I found a dealer in the dorm next door.
Who's the girl?

401
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,069
A sure thing.

402
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,354
- I'm paying.
- You're out of control.

403
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,272
It's about time, don't you think?

404
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,192
- This is payback.
- For what?

405
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,397
For all the times in school when you had
some slut in your bed...

406
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,472
and I'd lie there in the dark,
listen to you moaning and coming.

407
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,595
It made me sick.

408
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,593
We had a system.
If I had a girl in the room...

409
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,399
I'd put the Men at Work album outside
against the wall...

410
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,551
and you'd know not to come in.

411
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,314
It's always about what you want, asshole.

412
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,310
You insisted on coming in
most of the time...

413
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,756
because you had
a heavy course load and needed the rest.

414
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,717
Pussy. I knew what you wanted.

415
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,668
- What did I want?
- You wanted to hear me screw.

416
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,872
Because it was the closest thing
you could get to getting laid.

417
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,352
Being linked some way to my conquests,
living vicariously through me...

418
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,191
is always what's gotten you off.

419
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,920
And I could say the same thing
about Julia.

420
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,193
How it must have killed you
that I got what you never could.

421
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,438
I did get it. Once.

422
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,717
- Three-ways are double.
- We're not having a three-way.

423
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,519
Why not? Everything else has been.

424
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,593
I'll pay, Julia.

425
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,555
- My name's Rene.
- Not tonight. Tonight it's Julia.

426
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,833
Isn't this what you've always wanted?
Isn't this your dream?

427
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,993
Being part of Julia and I here,
not being the outsider looking in?

428
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,798
- You're crazy.
- And you haven't got the balls.

429
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,439
- Maybe I should come back.
- No.

430
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,679
Stay, Julia.

431
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,273
We'll always be together.
Is that how you want me to say it?

432
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,715
Yes.

433
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,390
Yes.

434
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,034
Good night.

435
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,437
Please come in, Doctor.

436
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,756
- How is she?
- The same.

437
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,469
Hello, Rose.

438
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,117
I'm Dr. McNamara.

439
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,078
One of your surgeons.

440
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,473
All night long, Rose was reaching out...

441
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,271
twitching her hand a little bit.

442
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,318
Grasping for something.

443
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,234
I was sitting beside her, talking to her,
telling her everything would be okay.

444
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,914
I thought she was reaching out
for me but...

445
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,238
I know now that she wasn't.

446
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,553
I finally told her:

447
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,871
"Rose, honey, Raven is in heaven.

448
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,950
"Your little sister didn't make it. "

449
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,873
After I told her that...

450
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,672
her fingers stopped moving.

451
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,159
I could feel her soul leave her...

452
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,871
just like I felt the breath come into her
when she was born.

453
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,038
Even if she gets better...

454
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,916
and we can take her off this thing...

455
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,038
she's not really gonna have any kind
of a life, is she?

456
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,992
Other than to be studied.

457
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,233
Other than to have those damn tabloids
try and sneak in and take her picture.

458
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,995
No.

459
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,596
She'll probably never have
the same quality of life on her own.

460
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,838
And she didn't want to.

461
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,598
They made a living will...

462
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,992
right before the surgery.

463
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,714
They didn't wanna live
if the other one died?

464
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,712
Why didn't you tell us that?

465
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,150
I told the girls I would, but...

466
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,839
I was selfish.

467
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,078
I didn't wanna be alone.

468
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,875
I kind of suspected that Raven
couldn't survive such a brutal separation.

469
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,519
She was so small...

470
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,398
and weak. She was like...

471
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,399
a little dove. But...

472
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,317
I thought maybe Rose,
even with the cancer...

473
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,991
maybe she had a chance
because she was just such a fighter.

474
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,955
But...

475
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,152
even if she got better...

476
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,108
a part of her...

477
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,755
the biggest part of her, has already died.

478
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,836
And I know in my heart...

479
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,557
that she wants to die with her.

480
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,788
After I do it...

481
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,629
will you put them back
the way they were...

482
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,511
so they can be together forever...

483
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,918
as God wanted them to be?

484
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,629
Thank you.

485
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,079
Go to your sister.

486
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,919
Go to your sister.

487
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,635
Fly.

488
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,070
I have to admit to you, Christian...

489
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,156
I am a better doctor because of you.

490
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,512
A better doctor with you.

491
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,194
I will never forgive you for what happened.

492
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,435
I know.

493
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,758
I'll never forgive her.

494
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,199
And then there's Matt.

495
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,114
The best thing
this partnership ever produced.

496
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,837
You raised him, Sean, not me.

497
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,551
I've tried to deny it, Christian...

498
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,912
but we raised Matt together.

499
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,718
Through good and bad...

500
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,469
he was always the best part of both of us.

501
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,429
He still is.

502
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,749
And that's a connection I can't let die.

503
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,475
English - SDH
