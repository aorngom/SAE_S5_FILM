00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,109
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,714
Do you think you could give
the coaching thing another try?

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,599
- I was hoping you'd ask.
- For Matt, I mean.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,749
I'm sure Julia will be very interested
to hear about what parts of life...

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,114
you're coaching her son in.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,114
And I'm sure Sean will be very interested
to know who Matt's real father is.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,154
Dr. McNamara, you come
to my lawyer's office and you talk to him.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,993
To your continued success.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,310
Maybe we should just skip
the rest of dinner...

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,598
and go right to the reward.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,911
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,750
If you're unsure, Mrs. Declan,
start with why you're here today.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,674
Well...

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,798
I made the appointment
because I was offered a senior discount...

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,235
at the movies without being
asked proof of age...

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,438
but now I think I've made a mistake.

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,878
You can relax. We're not here
to pressure you into any surgery.

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,871
I want a facelift. I mean,
choosing the two of you was a mistake.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,754
Before you jump to any conclusions,
can I give you a list of our references?

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,830
Save the spiel.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,197
The lady in your waiting room
convinced me you weren't worth my time.

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,952
I just wanted to see for myself.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,755
These butchers aren't interested
in your feelings.

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,309
You're just a literal pound of flesh to them.

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,074
- Mrs. Broderick, what are you doing?
- Hello, Dr. McNamara.

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,118
I'm just sharing with others
the legacy of your work.

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,510
Technically, it's called slander. Leave now.

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,194
After they've taken your money
and left you scarred...

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,799
you're no longer worth their time.

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,918
She is a disgruntled client.
Do not listen to what she's saying.

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,197
That's right.
A picture's worth a thousand words.

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,956
Nearly 20%/% of patients
who get lipo experience dimpling.

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,314
I explained those risks.

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,675
You shoved a waiver in my face
and said "sign. "

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,114
<i>That is not explaining.</i>

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,113
Look, if you want our help
at this point, a second surgery...

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,508
I don't want any surgery!

38
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,955
I could never trust you
to touch my body again.

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,634
Not after you...

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,395
violated me like this.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,275
- What do you want? Money?
- I don't need money.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,752
I'm not interested in going to court.

43
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,158
What I want is for you to publicly
acknowledge what you did to me...

44
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,311
and take responsibility for your actions...

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,755
so that other women
can learn from my tragedy.

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,319
What do you mean, "publicly"?

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,350
I contacted Andrea Hall.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,833
<i>She's the consumer-advocate reporter
for Channel 9 News...</i>

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,797
and Andrea agrees with me.

50
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,233
I'm one of an increasing number
of victims of careless plastic surgeons.

51
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,675
A victim? You're the one victimizing us!

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,479
Driving away patients,
confronting me in restaurants.

53
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,154
- I never got my job because of you.
- You never got it...

54
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,477
because nobody wants to buy tube tops
from a 55-year-old housewife...

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,437
who's suffering
from empty-nest syndrome!

56
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,790
Andrea will contact you
about the story this week.

57
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,311
Either you admit to your negligence
or you suffer the consequence.

58
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,956
I am not some piece of meat...

59
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,236
you can carve up and throw away.

60
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,950
Know that.

61
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,234
It's these women who need
to take more responsibility.

62
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,478
They try a new diet for a week,
and then when it doesn't work...

63
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,596
they think lipo
can solve all their problems.

64
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,399
Oh, my God, this rapist struck again.

65
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,279
There are serious risks involved,
but once you tell them...

66
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,352
they can go from a size 10 to a size 6,
that's all they hear.

67
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,231
She contacted the local media. You realize
what that could do to business?

68
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,392
Honey, you'll be fine.

69
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,917
You saw her at the restaurant.
That woman's unstable.

70
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,510
The truth will out. It always does.

71
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,558
Have you watched the local news lately?
They don't want truth.

72
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,757
They want salacious scandal.
That's what Bobbi Broderick is selling.

73
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,799
- The truth can't compete with that.
- I wish it couldn't compete with that.

74
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,669
"For the third time this month, another
young woman was brutally raped...

75
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,593
"by an unidentified man
waiting inside her home.

76
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,149
<i>"Due to the increasing brutality
of the attacks...</i>

77
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,311
"the police are calling him The Carver. "

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,879
We have to get an alarm for the house.
This happened 4 miles from here.

79
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,759
I'll call today. Who was the latest victim?
Did they say?

80
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,751
Naomi Gaines. A model.

81
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,159
You see? That's a real victim.
Not Bobbi Broderick.

82
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,915
That's someone who suffered a tragedy
she didn't instigate with carelessness.

83
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,229
This poor girl.

84
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,915
She probably won't work again
after what he did to her.

85
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,039
- You can drive Matt to school?
- He already left early to go in and study.

86
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,473
I guess Ava's really been on him
about his grades.

87
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,913
I wish we had more time together,
don't you?

88
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,998
Not if it means
missing more school, young man.

89
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,838
I could sleep over next time.

90
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,030
I could sneak home early
before anyone gets up.

91
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,353
We'd have all night.
Wouldn't that be great?

92
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,473
What would be great is if you could
come quicker, so I could get some rest.

93
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,637
Why aren't you at school?
I don't feel good. I'm not going.

94
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,394
Fine. Leave us alone, then.

95
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,111
If you're sick, I want you in bed.

96
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,119
All right, move over.

97
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,472
Dude, get the hell out of here.

98
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,756
Dude, don't think you're special.

99
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,994
She will dump you
as soon as she's sick of you, too.

100
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,753
What is with that kid?

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,276
He's jealous. Completely immature.

102
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,317
I swear, there are days
when I think of who I was at 16...

103
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,596
and regret I didn't have that abortion.

104
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,157
You had Adrian at 16?

105
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,430
That's gotta be weird for you, Ava.

106
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,716
Me being the same age as your son.

107
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,359
I mean, why are you with me?

108
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,669
I told you,
I'm attracted to your soul, Matt...

109
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,114
not your age.

110
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,798
Maybe what you're really saying is...

111
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,394
that you're uncomfortable being
with an older woman.

112
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,639
Let me shut the door if we're gonna talk.
I just want a little privacy, okay?

113
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,109
There's no shame
in what we do or say in here.

114
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,074
If we're gonna have
an open and honest relationship...

115
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,995
we can't hide behind closed doors.

116
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,392
- I thought you were with a consult.
- My third no-show this morning.

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,035
- In a row?
- Yup.

118
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,634
When I checked the appointment book,
I figured out why.

119
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,869
They're all fake.

120
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,158
8:00 a. m., Marion Crane.

121
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,391
<i>That was Janet Leigh's
character in Psycho.</i>

122
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,835
9:00 a. m., Sharon Tate. Manson murders.

123
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,276
9:45, Kitty Genovese...

124
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,635
woman in New York, 1964.

125
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,109
Like 38 people heard
her being stabbed to death...

126
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,599
and no one helped.

127
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,116
- Bobbi Broderick.
- And her gallery of famous victims.

128
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,876
This was sitting in the lobby for you.

129
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,672
Smells like a cheap fruit basket.

130
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,309
Oh, Christ.
Jesus.

131
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,234
"If you find yourself
with some free time this week...

132
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,555
"here's some more meat for you to carve. "

133
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,069
Unsigned.

134
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,153
- Your 11:00 is here.
- She's in my office? You saw her?

135
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,753
You don't forget that face.

136
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,437
NAOMl: You still think
you can help me now?

137
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,355
I hope you understand,
I wouldn't have insisted...

138
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,193
you come in if I didn't think time
was a critical factor.

139
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,030
<i>If we can properly close and reconstruct
the tissue in your cheeks soon...</i>

140
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,236
there'll be very little permanent scarring.

141
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,676
You mean on the outside, right?

142
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,473
I'm sorry. I'm afraid
I'm playing catch-up here.

143
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,915
How exactly did you get the scars?

144
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,355
Don't you ever pick up the paper,
watch the news?

145
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,830
Miss Gaines was brutalized
two nights ago by a serial rapist.

146
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,634
I'm so sorry.

147
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,919
The Carver.

148
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,231
That's what they're calling him.
Isn't it clever?

149
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,830
- You don't have to go into painful detail.
- No, I need to.

150
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,631
Do you know what he says
while he's ramming himself into you...

151
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,032
and you're choking on your own blood?

152
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,031
"Beauty is a curse on the world. "

153
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,792
He said that to the other girls, too.

154
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,432
And after that comes the good part.

155
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,555
That's when he takes out the knife.

156
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,349
May I?

157
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,029
It's okay.

158
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,716
Can you smile for me, Miss Gaines?

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,309
It's important, even if it's a little one.

160
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,273
I don't know if it's because I can't...

161
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,394
or I don't want to.

162
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,753
I think you can't
because your nerves have been severed.

163
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,917
- Is that permanent?
- Repairable.

164
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,674
I'd like to think
most of what's happened to you is.

165
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,390
I booked my first cover last month.

166
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,112
After five years of shitty catalog
and runway work...

167
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,719
I booked a cover.

168
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,957
I was making a name for myself.

169
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,798
Now people look at me...

170
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,154
and all they see is a victim.

171
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,397
I want my life back.

172
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,958
I can give you back your smile.
Won't that be a good start?

173
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,477
We'll see you Thursday at 3:30.

174
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,277
I forgot to ask you, how much is it?

175
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,271
I have some money in savings...

176
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,192
There will be no charge, Miss Gaines.

177
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,595
Thank you.

178
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,679
Why'd you call her in?

179
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,799
I just wanted to work on someone
who really needed my help.

180
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,673
It is a hell of a story.

181
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,110
I know. Can't keep those images
out of my mind.

182
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,996
Imagine what they'd look like on TV.

183
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,873
To hell with Bobbi Broderick.

184
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,837
We'll beat her at her own game.

185
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,910
How?

186
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,355
By delivering our own story
to Andrea Hall.

187
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,430
<i>I'm sorry. Mr. Alfred. Andrea Hall
from Channel 9 News.</i>

188
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,034
I wondered if you'd comment
on the asbestos charges...

189
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,155
<i>brought against you.</i>

190
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,993
<i>When I asked
the landlord about the asbestos...</i>

191
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,593
<i>he declined to comment...</i>

192
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,957
God, Jack, I come here
to get away from work, not relive it.

193
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,112
<i>Anything
you'd like to say?</i>

194
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,316
My usual poison, please.

195
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,035
Put it on my tab.

196
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,995
Thank you.

197
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,994
I have to say, you are much better-looking
in person than you are on TV.

198
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,391
In my business,
that's not necessarily a compliment.

199
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,155
Christian.

200
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,949
I'm a big fan.

201
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,032
In that case,
mind if we make this a double?

202
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,679
- It's been a long day.
- Please.

203
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,557
Exposing corruption.
It's a dirty business, huh?

204
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,188
It has its rewards.

205
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,595
It gets even better
if you let me buy you dinner.

206
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,359
What would you recommend here?

207
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,238
- Why would I know?
- This is your regular place.

208
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,877
- How do you know I come here after work?
- I did my homework.

209
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,839
See, now you're starting
to sound like a stalker.

210
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,229
As someone who hunts people down with
a camera and catches them off-guard...

211
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,909
I would have thought
you'd admire my approach.

212
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,515
But if I'm out of line...
No, I'm sorry.

213
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,314
You exploit people
on the 6:00 news for a living...

214
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,994
and sometimes it can come back
and bite you in the ass.

215
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,074
I promise not to bite.

216
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,798
Unless you ask me to later.

217
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,799
What the hell?
The alarm. Someone's breaking in.

218
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,559
What the hell are you doing?

219
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,356
- When did we get an alarm?
- This morning.

220
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,956
- Where are you coming from?
- I was at a friend's house studying.

221
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,553
It got late and we dozed off.

222
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,076
You expect us to believe you snuck out
in the middle of the night to study?

223
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,198
You wanted me to get my grades up.
It was late. I didn't wanna...

224
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,634
Whose house?

225
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,117
Adrian. Ava's son.

226
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,599
Ava doesn't have a son.

227
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,637
Yeah, she does. He's my age.

228
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,314
She tutors us together sometimes.

229
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,351
Look, I'm sorry, it won't happen again.

230
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,269
Next time you call,
no matter what time it is.

231
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,519
- Good morning.
- Not until I put my makeup on, it isn't.

232
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,313
I think all women look their best
before they get out of bed in the morning.

233
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,717
Maybe when you're 20.
Not when you're 35.

234
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,472
You mean 35 plus 10.

235
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,870
And you were such a gentleman last night.

236
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,150
- How old are you?
- You don't want to guess?

237
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,598
What are you doing?

238
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,669
I am a reporter, remember?
I stop at nothing to get the truth.

239
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,470
June, 1964? Asshole.

240
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,273
I guessed 36.

241
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,269
Wait a minute. Troy? Dr. Christian Troy?

242
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,035
Of McNamara/Troy, the plastic surgeons?

243
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,156
I'm honored. You've heard of me.

244
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,793
- You're my sweeps story.
- What do you mean, "sweeps story"?

245
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,354
Bobbi Broderick. That ring a bell?

246
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,398
She had some routine lipo done
at your firm recently.

247
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,830
She came out
looking like a pit-bull chew toy.

248
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,117
She contacted me about doing an exposé.

249
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,040
Did you know about this
before you slept with me?

250
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,398
You didn't honestly think...

251
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,478
that I would kill my story
because we had sex, did you?

252
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,638
Because my personal life
has never dictated my career.

253
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,790
Andrea, if you want
to prolong your career...

254
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,756
doing a smear story on plastic surgery,
which you're clearly going to need...

255
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,835
might not be the best thing for you.
Personally.

256
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,479
Bobbi was wrong about you
and your partner.

257
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,036
You're even worse than she described.

258
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,153
You want a real story, Andrea? Dig deeper.

259
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,751
This week, my partner and I
are doing pro bono work...

260
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,717
on one of the victims of The Carver.

261
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,759
My mom called? What did she say?

262
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,550
She left a message. I have to call her back.

263
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,994
What exactly did you tell her
about the other night?

264
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,991
I told her I was with Adrian.

265
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,869
Do you think she knows about us?
What should I do?

266
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,434
You can start with rubbing
more oil on my back.

267
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,790
First of all, if you keep acting
like a scared little boy, she will know.

268
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,758
Mothers have good intuition
when it comes to their children.

269
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,030
The only way to deal
with a situation like this...

270
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,519
is to confront it head-on.

271
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,391
I'm gonna call your mother back
right now.

272
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,276
You're not gonna tell her
about us, are you?

273
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,318
Why, are you ashamed of the feelings
we have for each other?

274
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,390
Does anybody wanna
put sunscreen on my back?

275
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,713
I'll be right back.

276
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,398
You wanna jerk off or something?

277
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,235
- What?
- Before the old lady comes back?

278
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,517
Relax. I gotta take it when I can get it.

279
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,668
There's no locks in the house.

280
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,434
The only privacy I get is out here
when she's in there.

281
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,999
Yeah, well, it's not appropriate,
and don't ask me that again.

282
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,879
Right, you need to save your load
for my mom, anyway.

283
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,272
Look, Adrian...

284
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,794
I don't want there to be
any weirdness between us, okay?

285
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,871
Save the father-son talk for your daddy.

286
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,435
Your psychobabble attempt
at bonding is pathetic.

287
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,109
Chill with the attitude, okay?
I'm not here to take your shit.

288
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,309
You're boring me.

289
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,473
Your boyfriend misses you.

290
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,552
Tomorrow night, don't make any plans.

291
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,996
We're going to the McNamaras
so Julia can meet Matt's study partner.

292
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,718
So I have to do you a favor now?

293
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,428
Watch your lip, mister.

294
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,556
You're not too old for a backhand,
and I'm wearing heavy rings.

295
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,358
Fine, I'll play along. But then I get a favor.

296
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,635
So what'd she say?

297
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,879
We're all gonna have dinner
with your mom tomorrow night.

298
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,758
And this is what we're gonna do.

299
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,117
BOBBl: Take a look at the plastic surgery
of McNamara/Troy.

300
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,113
That's my stomach.
Are you considering plastic surgery?

301
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,111
Look at this picture. This is my stomach.

302
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,918
What do you think you're you doing?

303
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,753
What you're not.
Informing vulnerable women...

304
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,798
about the three most dangerous words
in the English language:

305
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,871
"It's only liposuction. "

306
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,076
- Nice.
- Yeah. I got tired of flashing people.

307
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,592
Are you interested in liposuction?
Are you interested in plastic...

308
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,274
- I have lawyers.
- Tell that to Andrea Hall!

309
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,635
I'm sure she'd love to interview them!

310
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,513
BOBBl: Don't go in that office.

311
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,515
No, we're gonna be here for a few hours.
I'll call you when we're leaving. Bye.

312
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,550
<i>Dr. McNamara?
Andrea Hall, Channel 9 News.</i>

313
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,794
Yes, I know, I've seen you on TV.

314
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,115
Let's go into my office,
where I can give you my point of view.

315
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,998
Bad idea, partner.

316
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,557
The fishies are pretty,
but they don't make interesting B roll.

317
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,594
Maybe you'd like to take
a look at our surgery suite.

318
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,673
- I just propped it out a little for you.
- Terrific. Thanks.

319
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,754
Guess who I gave
four orgasms to last night.

320
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,238
Oh, Christ.

321
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,755
- I thought she was here about Bobbi.
- No, Naomi.

322
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,832
But she has to agree to go on camera,
talk about her attack...

323
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,752
- and have her surgery filmed.
- What?

324
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,556
We don't know if she'll do all that.

325
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,952
I think that when you ask her, you stress
to her that her story of survival...

326
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,429
could be very inspirational
to other women.

327
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,909
I'm not gonna manipulate her,
and neither are you.

328
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,437
Hey, I already put my ass on the line
for us last night, Sean. Literally.

329
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,595
- Now it's your turn.
- Where're you going?

330
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,116
Facial. We have to look our best
if we're gonna be on camera.

331
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,672
This model recreates the damage
to your facial nerves.

332
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,991
In order to reverse paralysis here...

333
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,276
I'll bring in a donor nerve from your thigh.

334
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,512
<i>That'll allow me to reconstruct
the nerve endings in your cheeks...</i>

335
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,477
so that after we re-suture the scar...

336
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,910
you'll be re-booking that cover in no time.

337
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,198
You think I can still have a career?

338
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,072
More than that.

339
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,036
I think your story of survival...

340
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,554
could be an inspiration
to a lot of other women.

341
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,879
- That was the wrong thing to say.
- No. It wasn't.

342
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,713
It's just, you're the first person...

343
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,992
who's seen me as someone
who can really recover from all of this.

344
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,515
It gives me hope.

345
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,878
Imagine what other people might feel
if they heard your story.

346
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,474
- What it could do for them.
- What do you mean?

347
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,151
The timing might be odd...

348
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,629
but we have a news crew
coming by to record...

349
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,552
some of the pro bono work we do here.

350
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,076
I think you should let them interview you.

351
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,474
Go on camera, looking like this?

352
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,870
No.

353
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,949
Every time I've seen
someone like me on the news...

354
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,752
all I can think is:
"I'm glad that didn't happen to me. "

355
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,356
I'm sorry, that probably sounds awful.

356
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,559
Personally, Naomi...

357
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,760
if I saw you on television
sharing your story...

358
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,911
I'd think you were very courageous.

359
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,998
When you first came into our office...

360
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,754
you said you didn't wanna
be seen as a victim anymore.

361
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,750
By showing your face and telling
your story, you're taking your power back.

362
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,269
15-blade.

363
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,237
Think we could
switch sides now?

364
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,193
I spent $200
on a mineral exfoliating scrub.

365
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,955
They've only shot the back
of my head this whole time. It isn't fair.

366
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,636
Could you focus
on the patient, please?

367
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,759
Bring in the microscope.

368
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,352
Thanks. I feel so silly
that I never knew you had a son.

369
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,478
I'm so used to keeping my personal life
from my clients.

370
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,552
It's just instinct not to reveal
those details anymore.

371
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,633
You sure it's not because you like
to pretend I don't exist?

372
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,395
I guess we can all help ourselves.

373
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,160
Mom, you really went all out tonight.

374
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,511
My mom's roast chicken is the best.

375
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,956
I don't eat anything
that used to have a face.

376
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,832
I'm a vegan, Mrs. McNamara.

377
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,789
Since when?

378
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,755
That's okay.

379
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,517
Getting Matt to eat
anything but red meat is an effort.

380
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,909
I guess that's the one thing
we don't have in common.

381
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,674
What do you and Matt
have in common, Adrian?

382
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,033
You mean aside from the fact
I have to share him with my mom?

383
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,195
She really is the best French tutor
you can get.

384
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,034
She's very hands-on with Matt, too.

385
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,359
Music. We share the same taste in music.

386
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,036
House, Rasta.

387
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,030
Then, Matt, why don't you show Adrian
your CD collection...

388
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,350
and that'll give me and Ava time...

389
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,909
to make something
that we can all eat together.

390
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,512
Have you and my mom done it in here yet?

391
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,949
Adrian, your mom said
you were cool with all this.

392
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,156
Why do you keep trying
to blow it out there?

393
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,595
This your dad?

394
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,351
Yeah, his 40th birthday party.

395
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,636
I know your parents weren't married.

396
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,312
Do you ever see your dad?

397
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,196
I don't even have a picture of him.

398
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,634
Certainly never had a birthday
with the son of a bitch.

399
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,675
You guys close?

400
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,553
Of course you are. You're just one big,
happy family in this house.

401
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,839
No wonder my mom fell for you.

402
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,753
You have everything.

403
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,989
You even smell good.

404
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,597
What are you doing? I'm not gay.

405
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,318
So what? Neither am I.

406
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,474
Dude, kissing another guy is gay.

407
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,473
Hey, I'm warning you, stay away from me.

408
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,238
After what happened with Henry...

409
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,597
I've been so worried about Matt
meeting the right friends.

410
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,193
You really did make me something.
I'd have eaten the chicken.

411
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,915
I'm so used to asking for things
and not getting them...

412
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,752
I didn't realize someone would care.

413
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,037
You're confusing personal attention
with ground rules, Adrian.

414
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,915
The truth of the matter is
you're denied nothing.

415
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,913
Really, Mom? When I asked you
and Matt to keep it down...

416
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,117
while you were humping the other night,
you didn't do that for me.

417
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,275
That's denial.

418
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,592
Did he mean what he just said?

419
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,279
Go wait in the car, Adrian.

420
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,714
- But Matt's mom's...
- Now!

421
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,280
Julia, Matt and I discussed
the fact that our...

422
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,631
relationship would come as a shock...

423
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,230
but please realize
it has nothing to do with you.

424
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,072
You call it a relationship?

425
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,757
I let you into my house...

426
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,478
and you violate that trust...

427
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,596
by using me to seduce my son?

428
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,352
But, Mom, it wasn't all her fault.

429
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,033
There are no victims here, Julia.

430
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,317
Matt's old enough to make his own
decisions about his sexual partners.

431
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,879
What are you, a pedophile?

432
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,634
I put an alarm on this house
to keep monsters out...

433
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,109
when shockingly, the true monster...

434
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,919
was right in front of my face
the entire time.

435
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,355
Look, I understand
why you'd be uncomfortable...

436
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,078
with the notion of sexual expression.

437
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,832
That's why you came to me...

438
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,719
to deal with your own shame issues
around sex.

439
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,191
Now really, if Matt's gonna learn
anything positive about intimacy...

440
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,032
he needs someone with the right skills.

441
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,714
Just because you can't get
your own child to love you...

442
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,989
don't try and take away mine.

443
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,310
He's not yours to have anymore, Julia.

444
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,870
You need to get over this Oedipal stage
before you smother Matt...

445
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,235
and he never forms
a healthy sexual identity.

446
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,712
Boy, I bet your bullshit business
would just tank if your clients knew...

447
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,873
that their life coach was sleeping
with boys barely out of puberty!

448
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,432
Don't try and intimidate me, Julia.
You wanna play games?

449
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,559
I will push right back and I will win.

450
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,279
Don't threaten my mom.

451
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,510
Matt, your mother doesn't really have
your best interests at heart here.

452
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,955
Don't you ever touch him again...

453
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,236
or I swear to God I will kill you.

454
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,550
Now get out of my house!

455
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,316
I know we both wants what's best for him.

456
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,713
I'm sure you can figure out
for yourself what that is, Matt.

457
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,478
How could you not tell me about this?

458
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,551
- Mom, I'm sorry...
- Don't.

459
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,629
Just don't.

460
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,710
- Can I look?
- Yeah.

461
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,550
Oh, my God.

462
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,790
I never thought I would see
this person again.

463
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,790
NAOMl: Thank you.

464
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,830
I need you to smile for me,
so I can tell if the nerves are fusing yet.

465
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,390
What if I can't? I'm scared, after all of this.

466
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,914
I don't know.

467
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,992
Why did the turkey cross the road?

468
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,359
It's the chicken's day off.

469
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,191
My daughter told me that.
It's one of the only jokes I know.

470
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,839
I guess it didn't work.

471
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,789
Yeah. Very nice.

472
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,349
No, it's okay if it hurts.
That means it's healing.

473
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,755
So this is where you hide your victims.

474
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,714
How did you get in here?

475
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,673
I'm still your patient.
I have every right to be here.

476
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,270
I brought this for you to take a look at.

477
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,472
It concerns your safety.

478
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,357
- I'm sorry. Who are you?
- Nobody. Excuse us.

479
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,317
Don't you touch me again.

480
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,033
You might be able to get Andrea
to drop my story...

481
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,714
but you are not gonna be able
to get out of a lawsuit.

482
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,512
I'm putting together a class-action suit
against McNamara/Troy.

483
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,553
I'd encourage you to take a look
at my story of surgical negligence...

484
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,393
and join me in putting
these monsters out of business.

485
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,311
- What went wrong? You look fine to me.
- Fine?

486
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,869
I was lied to...

487
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,436
about the consequences of my liposuction.

488
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,149
I have bumps all over my stomach.

489
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,513
And what happened to you?

490
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,471
I was attacked in my home by a man
who raped me and carved up my face.

491
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,592
How can you violate this girl again?

492
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,672
BOBBl: Hasn't she suffered enough?
NAOMl: What are you talking about?

493
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,274
Dr. McNamara fixed my face...

494
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,637
and he probably saved my career.

495
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,675
I thought since we were both victims...

496
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,909
NAOMl: Lady, hold on.

497
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,073
You are not a victim.

498
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,550
Next time you look in the mirror
at your flat stomach that you paid for...

499
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,076
think for one second what I went through,
and you'll see the difference.

500
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,108
I'll take care of this.

501
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,108
Now I'm pressing charges.

502
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,078
Did I really walk into her room
and compare her story to mine?

503
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,435
I understand why they didn't hire you.
You're crazy.

504
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,398
They didn't hire me
because I didn't show up for the interview!

505
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,869
I chickened out.

506
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,358
It wasn't your bad lipo job, it was me.

507
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,916
I did everything
that you told me not to do.

508
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,110
I overate. I didn't exercise.

509
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,599
I did this to myself.

510
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,800
That way I could blame it
on everybody else...

511
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,315
except myself.

512
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,395
Why?

513
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,958
They were never gonna hire me
to be a personal shopper.

514
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,996
I didn't have the experience.

515
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,115
All I really wanted
was for somebody to say:

516
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,993
"What do you think, Bobbi?"

517
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,193
I just wanted to matter again.

518
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,030
I didn't realize
you were under so much stress.

519
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,555
I'm sorry.

520
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,439
I could have explained
about your recovery a little better.

521
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,432
I'm sorry about the meat thing.

522
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,033
It was really wrong.

523
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,832
We usually give all our potential clients
a list of references...

524
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,831
before they schedule any surgery.

525
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,675
If you'd be open to it, I'd like to add you
to the list for them to call.

526
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,832
You'd use me as a reference now?

527
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,195
I mean, my liposuction was a disaster...

528
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,640
- and I couldn't lie about that.
- I don't want you to.

529
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,710
A "con" point of view might be
a nice and necessary perspective.

530
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,030
It'd also give you a chance to hear
someone ask, "What do you think, Bobbi?"

531
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,193
I wanna break up with you.

532
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,913
Matt, don't allow fear to destroy
the good in your life.

533
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,833
I'm not changing my mind.

534
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,510
I just wanted to be a man,
and come over and tell you to your face.

535
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,070
Be a man? Okay, I can respect that.

536
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,116
If you're so grown up then, explain to me...

537
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,555
why you feel we can't
continue this relationship.

538
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,349
I can't keep going around
and lying to everyone.

539
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,389
I'm done.

540
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,749
The last thing I wanna do
is cause you more pain.

541
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,076
But through my professional experience,
I can see what you don't.

542
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,316
Your mother is the duplicitous one,
not you.

543
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,870
Why would you say that?
You don't know her at all.

544
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,878
These unexplained,
subconscious feelings of conflict...

545
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,113
bubbling up to the surface
and causing painful exterior drama...

546
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,275
are completely explainable.

547
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,438
They are not your fault.

548
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,959
When you've been cruelly denied
the truth about the core of your identity...

549
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,078
how could you not have doubt?

550
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,275
My identity is fine, Ava.

551
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,515
Your identity is predicated on a lie,
perpetuated by your mother.

552
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,717
What are you doing in my room?

553
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,110
Something I should
have done a long time ago.

554
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,557
Finding out what the hell
is going on in my son's life.

555
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,994
By going through my stuff?

556
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,072
From now on, you'll have to earn
your privacy in this house.

557
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,716
There are gonna be
no more secrets between us.

558
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,394
Why don't we start by the one
you're keeping from me?

559
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,072
- What are you talking about?
- Ava told me.

560
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,358
You've been lying to me,
my whole life, about who I am.

561
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,479
Ava is a manipulator, Matt. You cannot
believe anything she tells you.

562
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,392
Christian's my real dad, isn't he?

563
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,314
What?

564
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,672
That's crazy.

565
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,912
I've seen the way you two look
at each other, how close you are.

566
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,071
He even said he thinks of me as a son.

567
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,996
If you want me to be honest with you
about my life, then tell me the truth.

568
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,078
Is Christian...

569
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,394
my real father?

570
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,989
Tell me!

571
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,315
Yes.

572
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,030
I didn't know for the longest time.

573
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,557
Matt, I'm so sorry.

574
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,909
I didn't know what to do. We're a family.

575
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,709
No, this whole family is bullshit,
and you're the reason why.

576
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,553
Don't talk to me like that.
I am still your mother!

577
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,716
You're not my mother. You're a whore.

578
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,032
Even if you did hit me,
it would still be true.

579
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,269
Matt, I am so sorry.

580
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,233
You have to understand...

581
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,673
none of this changes
the way that I feel about you...

582
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,877
the way your dad feels about you.

583
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,716
Does he even know, or have you been
lying to him this whole time, too?

584
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,394
About what?

585
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,394
Lying about what?
What the hell's going on here?

586
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,554
Ava...

587
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,992
and I have been seeing each other.

588
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,235
We slept together.

589
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,595
What? Since when?

590
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,632
You just found out about this?

591
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,629
It's over.

592
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,595
Dad.

593
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,193
Hey, it's okay, Matt.

594
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,228
We'll figure this out.

595
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,595
Its okay.

596
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,069
