1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,359
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,189
Is that why you're in love
with Christian?

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,439
He's been one of my closest friends
for over 20 years.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,716
And you've been in love with him
for all this time.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,552
What's going on?
Nothing...

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,154
except that my mother is leaving tonight.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,549
How long have you
been sleeping with her?

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,149
Oh, God. I feel like
I'm going to be sick.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,230
Welcome to my world.
Doesn't feel good, does it?

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,031
Miss Charles, tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,754
You tell me.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,709
It's not about what we think.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,758
<i>It's how the patient experiences
their own appearance.</i>

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,157
What they'd like to change
to improve their negative self-image.

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,710
You know the only thing worse
than having a negative self-image?

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,910
- Having no self-image?
- I'm impressed.

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,512
I wouldn't expect a lothario like you
to get that.

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,029
What makes you so certain
that he's the lothario?

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,189
Well...

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,036
any successful man like yourself who
wears Old Spice got it for Father's Day.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,076
Any man who'll spend a $185 on a bottle
of Creed isn't wearing it to please his wife.

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,509
They should put you to work
solving crimes.

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,956
Actually, I'm a designer. Rockets.

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,035
Perfume.

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,233
Two of my scents became
best sellers this year...

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,589
so I decided to do a little remodeling,
for the dating season.

27
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,998
What's the name of your scent?
I'll have to buy some.

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,559
Well, that wouldn't be fair.

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,994
To whom?
Women.

30
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,678
You're hard to resist as it is without
adding extra pheromones into the mix.

31
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,832
Miss Charles, are you flirting with me?

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,194
That depends.

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,275
Am I pretty enough to flirt with you?

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,392
- No.
- Good.

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,992
Then fix whatever needs fixing.
Make me into someone that you'd want.

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,156
- Make me a 10.
- We're not cosmeticians, Miss Charles.

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,591
We're talking about permanent changes.

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,957
Besides, everyone's idea of beauty varies.

39
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,352
It's in the eye of the beholder.
Wrong.

40
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,031
Pretty is in the eye of the beholder.
Beauty is in the soul.

41
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,157
You can't see it,
but you know it when you feel it.

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,315
<i>Come on.</i>

43
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,792
You guys are the top plastic surgeons
in Florida. Give me the superficial facts.

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,799
What would you change?

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,475
- Your eyes. The pigmentation...
- They're spooky.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,594
Thank you. Go on.

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,234
Was this the result of a trauma or illness?

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,069
I was born this way.
In the dark, so to speak.

49
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,791
I have no way of knowing if my nose
is too big, if my lips are too thin...

50
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,633
Except for your eyes, you're a 10.

51
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,637
Although you already know that.

52
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,589
We can recommend an excellent ocularist.

53
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,678
We'll work with him together
on color, size, shape.

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,318
What color will they be?

55
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,149
Blue, maybe.

56
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,478
With a tiny hint of green.

57
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,914
Blue. Like the ocean and the sky.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,069
Nice.

59
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,514
- You're smiling, aren't you?
- Actually, it's more of a smirk.

60
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,791
You're not as good as you think.

61
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,392
How about Thursday afternoon?
I can make an appointment for you.

62
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,996
I can make my own appointment.
I like to be independent.

63
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,278
I also like to be driven.

64
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,910
Learning to skate, or do you just want
to carry a big stick?

65
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,832
Tampa Bay Lightning,
signed by the entire team.

66
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,911
Only $350. It's worth a lot more
after winning the cup.

67
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,997
It's nice that you're here.
I wasn't expecting to see you.

68
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,636
You usually hate these things.

69
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,156
If it's for Annie's school,
it's the least I could do.

70
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,594
I'm used to going
to these things by myself.

71
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,436
Then tonight's no exception.

72
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,518
I was at your sign-up sheet,
and there's all these women there...

73
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,830
but they're too embarrassed
to put their names down.

74
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,956
But I think I got the ball rolling.

75
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,999
I told them you did a great job on these.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,070
Oh, hi.

77
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,399
Maybe I should go
and keep pumping the bids.

78
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,715
You're too good to give it away for free.

79
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,157
I can't believe you brought that...

80
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,915
walking slab of silicone
to our daughter's school.

81
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,433
She's the one who suggested I donate
my surgical skill to the highest bidder.

82
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,354
I thought you didn't even like big tits.

83
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,155
I guess I was lying. My bad.

84
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,269
- Well, I'm just glad I didn't bring Annie.
- Yeah, you better watch out.

85
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,954
She'll end up
running away from you like Matt.

86
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,474
What's happened to you?

87
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,552
I'm having a good time, Julia.
A really good time.

88
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,759
Your holier-than-thou attitude won't make
me feel shitty for bringing Kimber here...

89
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,833
'cause you've got no right to be holier
than anybody ever again.

90
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,273
Every guy in this room is looking
at her tits, and wishing they were me...

91
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,635
and not going home with their bitter,
unhappy, and resentful wives.

92
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,074
Is this how it's going to be from now on?

93
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,351
Face it, Julia. You've lost your boy.

94
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,359
Methyl methacrylate.
It's lighter...

95
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,828
and more responsive to the muscles
that control the movement of the eye.

96
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,952
And it's virtually unbreakable.
Unbreakable?

97
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,949
You mean in case
they pop out of my head?

98
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,511
No, but, they might fall from the sink
when you're trying to wash them.

99
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,952
I recently replaced a patient's left eye
because it had been eaten by his dog.

100
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,874
May I?
What are you doing?

101
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,273
Eyes are a reflection
of the soul.

102
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,909
<i>I need to know
who's behind the eyes I'm making.</i>

103
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,356
That's why it takes me a little longer
than the rest.

104
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,033
To me,
it's more than a science. It's an art.

105
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,076
There are 12 steps
to the painting alone.

106
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,278
<i>Each element within the eye
requires its own special blend of color.</i>

107
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,112
<i>The red veins are sometimes duplicated
by using thin strands of fabric...</i>

108
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,476
<i>and carefully placing them on the plastic.</i>

109
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,155
The verisimilitude is astonishing.

110
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,590
When do you think I could have them?

111
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,434
As soon as your damaged eyeballs
are removed...

112
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,318
and the implants sewn into place.

113
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,358
- I can schedule her next week.
- Then next week it is.

114
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,430
<i>Once the orbal implants
are in place...</i>

115
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,712
<i>they provide the necessary anchor
for the artificial eye.</i>

116
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,395
That's when you and I are ready to begin.

117
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,474
You come in...

118
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,838
and I position this impression tray
in your socket.

119
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,511
Don't worry. It will feel odd,
but not painful.

120
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,509
<i>I use it to make an algenate impression
of the cavity within your eye.</i>

121
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,475
<i>When it's dry and smooth
and a perfect fit...</i>

122
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,558
<i>it serves as a mold
for the actual plastic insert...</i>

123
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,713
<i>that will become your new eye.
Then the fitting.</i>

124
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,591
<i>That's when the miracle happens.</i>

125
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,952
<i>Miracle?
Animating what's lifeless.</i>

126
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,870
<i>A mere piece of plastic,
and we give the soul its voice.</i>

127
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,278
It all sounds so gruesome.

128
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,353
- Do you really think it's worth it?
- I've never had a disappointed customer.

129
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,958
I don't like to toot my own horn...
Well, yes, I do, because I'm the best.

130
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,750
If you weren't, we wouldn't be here.

131
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,718
So, you wanted to know
what my recommendation would be.

132
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,679
This is it.

133
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,556
What color eyes were you thinking?

134
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,237
Blue. With a hint of green.

135
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,075
Good.

136
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,836
Life's about change right? Transformation.

137
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,278
And I'd just like to see this time
as an opportunity...

138
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,876
to explore other possibilities.

139
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,272
Well, outside of being a wife
and mother, I mean.

140
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,312
- Did you say you were divorced?
- Separated.

141
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,833
If it makes you feel any better,
70%/% of the breast augmentations I do...

142
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,037
are on women divorced or in the process.

143
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,276
It can be quite healing and a way
of affirming your desirability.

144
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,189
Some of my patients even have implants
as part of their settlement.

145
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,314
Well, there's a thought.
Maybe I should wait until we file.

146
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,633
Why don't you open your blouse so we
can see what we have to work with here?

147
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,919
Have you done a lot of these?

148
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,556
Let's say that since I began this practice,
micromastia has become an epidemic.

149
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,474
- Micromastia?
- Small-breastedness.

150
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,110
I always thought they were average.

151
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,273
Micromastia? It sounds like a disease.

152
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,192
In our culture, it often is.

153
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,435
Breasts are a symbol
of our femininity...

154
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,830
the closest thing we have
to a phallic symbol...

155
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,879
and like it or not,
we live in a world where size matters.

156
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,674
For both.

157
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,230
I think we can go up to a C or even a D
and still keep your natural drop.

158
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,389
I don't want them to be huge.
I mean, just different.

159
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,870
Better. A new me, you know?

160
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,154
I'm sure you'll be delighted because
you're doing it for the right reason.

161
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,514
Yourself.

162
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,953
What's sad are the ones that do it
thinking they can get their husbands back.

163
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,279
It's heartbreaking.

164
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,155
What are you doing?

165
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,550
I'm monitoring
your heart, sweetie.

166
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,037
Standard procedure. Try to relax.

167
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,396
You know,
maybe I shouldn't be doing this.

168
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,869
I have two kids.
The youngest one is only eight.

169
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,554
She's at my husband's.
If anything happened to me...

170
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,513
Don't you worry. Dr. Copley's the best.

171
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,757
She hasn't botched one yet.

172
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,194
Yeah. She did these. Pretty good, huh?

173
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,111
Did having them done
really change anything...

174
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,519
in your love life?

175
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,275
Fourteen carat, and he never gets bored.

176
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,634
Okay, Julia, we're going to begin.

177
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,313
As the anesthesia starts to work,
you're going to feel as if you're floating.

178
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,678
One more look, for old times' sake.

179
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,672
And now, counting back
from 10 to one.

180
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,790
Ten...

181
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,030
nine...

182
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,719
<i>eight...</i>

183
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,918
I love Oceania. I love it.
They make the best Chilean sea bass.

184
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,559
<i>You know what? I'm not sure...</i>

185
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,792
but my doctor just walked into the room,
so I'll ask him.

186
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,476
Is it too soon for me to make
dinner plans for Saturday night?

187
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,958
You're an independent woman.

188
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,156
- Hot date?
- Hope so.

189
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,909
He answered my personal ad
on the Internet.

190
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,159
Well, why don't you call him back after...

191
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,197
I've finished checking you out?

192
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,314
Ron, can I get back to you?

193
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,190
My very hunky doctor wants to stare
deeply into my beautiful new acrylic eyes.

194
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,511
Great. I'll talk to you later.

195
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,632
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

196
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,552
I'm just checking your tear ducts.

197
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,035
Something.

198
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,070
It's written all over your forehead.

199
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,670
No man who answers an Internet ad
is after a deep personal connection...

200
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,751
that doesn't involve his penis.

201
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,593
You know, I think I read that
in a fortune cookie once.

202
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,318
I thought you were smarter than that.

203
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,950
Funny, my incredibly smart friend Janet
met her husband that way.

204
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,189
Was she blind?

205
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,275
I'm sorry. I just meant that...

206
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,153
men are assholes, and being blind
just makes you an easier mark.

207
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,558
Are we through here?

208
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,639
Look directly at me and try
to move your eyes from side to side.

209
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,552
There's not a lot of mobility yet...

210
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,234
but the muscle reattachment
seems to be holding.

211
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,229
Is that it?

212
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,190
Look, it's men. We're just wired that way.

213
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,035
Even if some small part of our brains
actually gives a damn about your soul...

214
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,988
it's always short-circuited by the part
that wants to get into your pants.

215
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,912
I'm a big girl, Doctor.

216
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,638
I don't use a Seeing Eye dog.

217
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,634
I certainly don't need
a seeing-eye doctor to rescue me...

218
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,754
from all those bad, big,
scary men out there...

219
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,753
just waiting to prey on us blind
damsels in distress.

220
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,594
Be careful.

221
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,629
You know what the upside
to being blind is?

222
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,710
There's no fear of the unknown,
because it's all unknown.

223
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,078
Everything is chance.
Meeting this guy, crossing the street...

224
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,393
picking outfits that match,
buying groceries.

225
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,515
I'm not expecting to fall in love.

226
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,399
But you never know.

227
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,319
Just a minute.

228
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,031
Matt wasn't exaggerating, was he?

229
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,151
You really do look a bit
like a crack whore, sweetheart.

230
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,669
- I can't believe that Matt called you.
- I can't believe you didn't.

231
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,953
Did he say anything else?
About why I moved out?

232
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,039
Because Matty has two fathers.
You were young, you made a mistake.

233
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,033
You don't have to spend
the rest of your life atoning for it.

234
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,189
Why not?

235
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,994
- I ruined my husband's life.
- Bullshit.

236
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,351
You ruined your own by not living it.

237
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,990
If Sean doesn't want anything
more to do with you, yippee. You're free.

238
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,438
Get off your ass and stop depending on
other people for your sense of self-worth.

239
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,999
You really should have
your own talk show.

240
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,635
Now, I'm staying at the Raleigh.

241
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,749
You're coming with me...

242
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,912
until we can find someplace
more suitable for you and Annie.

243
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,669
God knows
what's living under these carpets.

244
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,671
Please leave my things alone, Mother.

245
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,512
I don't need you to swoop in here...

246
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,194
and start telling me
what I should and shouldn't do.

247
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,473
Take enough Xanax,
it won't matter what you do.

248
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,394
It's Vicodin. I need something
to help me with the pain.

249
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,071
I had my breasts augmented.

250
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,152
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

251
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,233
Good for you, sweetheart.
At least you did something.

252
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,914
When I said you should make
the most out of yourself...

253
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,917
I wasn't referring to your bra size.

254
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,469
You had a facelift, Mother.
What's the difference?

255
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,312
I did it for professional reasons.

256
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,393
The only professional reason for that
is to look better dancing on a pole.

257
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,628
You're a brilliant, gifted girl, Julia.

258
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,117
Why are brains the last
on your list of things to develop?

259
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,472
Because they're the last things
on the list that matter.

260
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,555
Just be smart enough to know
that when your kids come home...

261
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,914
they need a hug,
a kiss, some goddamn tenderness.

262
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,273
And they don't want to be told
how they screwed up...

263
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,193
because 10-to-1 they already know.

264
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,433
Tell me what you need.

265
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,749
For God's sake, Erica, look around.

266
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,631
<i>I've been eating
microwave macaroni and cheese.</i>

267
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,158
I haven't washed my hair in days
because I can't lift my arms.

268
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,438
And if I leave the garbage out any longer,
I'll start attracting wildlife.

269
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,275
Why didn't you arrange
for a practical nurse...

270
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,953
before you left the hospital?

271
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,155
Because I chose to have it done,
and I don't want Sean paying for it.

272
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,873
I'll write a check.

273
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,514
Forget it.

274
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,149
The interest is way too high.

275
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,631
But thanks for coming over.

276
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,876
And if you happen to bump into anyone
resembling a mother...

277
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,511
tell her I could use one.

278
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,309
Tits.

279
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,389
- What are you talking about?
- Bazooms. Power boobies.

280
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,592
Apparently, an IQ of 160 isn't enough
to get her through this transition...

281
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,594
without acquiring
equally impressive knockers.

282
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,958
Julia got breast implants?

283
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,109
- I don't believe it.
- What the hell was she thinking?

284
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,193
Sean, according to Matt,
you're dating Porn Star Barbie.

285
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,915
That would make any woman
feel inadequate.

286
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,475
What do you expect us to do?

287
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,757
Take them out and tell her
they were fine the way they were before?

288
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,469
Julia's in crisis.
Have you seen where she's living?

289
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,356
Where Annie's living
when she's not with you?

290
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,795
You're not suggesting
I take Annie away from her.

291
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,030
Let's just hear what she has to say.

292
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,556
I want us all to come together,
in a caring...

293
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,638
nonjudgmental manner...

294
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,753
and present Julia
with our observations and concerns.

295
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,679
- You want us to stage an intervention.
- Oh, God.

296
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,829
Yes.

297
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,799
I've gotten the name
of the top psychiatrist in the area.

298
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,078
I've pulled strings to make an appointment
but I can't make sure she shows up.

299
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,157
- Why not?
- Because I won't be here.

300
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,435
Of course.

301
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,719
This is beautiful.
But your daughter's in crisis, Erica.

302
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,479
What's more important than that?

303
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,915
I have to be in Los Angeles
at the end of the week.

304
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,071
I'm giving a lecture.
On mothering?

305
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,389
But you'll be back.

306
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,551
You can't just intervene and run.

307
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,431
I'm trying to put a support system
into place before I go.

308
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,112
You mean dump her on us.

309
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,994
So you're just going to cut her off.

310
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,037
Where'd you get the balls?

311
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,873
She's the only one being punished.

312
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,429
If she's got to wear a scarlet letter,
then so do you.

313
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,397
How about I stage
an intervention with you?

314
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,470
Take it easy.

315
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,712
You've done more harm to Julia
than we could ever do in a lifetime.

316
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,757
You're the real reason
she's so screwed-up!

317
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,912
You never saw her
except as a reflection of yourself.

318
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,991
Shit, you never saw her, period.

319
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,988
You were always busy working,
helping your patients with their problems.

320
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,430
Well, she's your problem now, Erica.

321
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,637
You broke her, you fix her.

322
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,637
The best thing about not being with Julia
is I don't have to be nice to her mother.

323
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,993
- You think I'm a dick?
- I didn't say anything.

324
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,199
You want to become part
of Erica's intervention?

325
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,274
I hurt Julia.

326
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,351
I do that a lot. Hurt and run.

327
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,634
- If there's a chance to help...
- She's had enough help.

328
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,032
I've spent my life rescuing, supporting,
protecting her, and so have you.

329
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,989
Now look what's happened.
We've enabled her so much she's disabled.

330
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,279
You want to be a hero?
Go find someone who really needs one.

331
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,190
Ron. Hi.

332
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,033
What's so funny?

333
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,913
Me. I'm such an asshole.

334
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,398
One more?

335
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,909
Honey, hold still. It's hard to see
when you keep moving around.

336
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,553
But it really itches.

337
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,030
Honey, can you go get that?
It's your grandmother.

338
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,833
There she is.

339
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,912
How are you, sweetheart?

340
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,237
There's a charming
two-bedroom on Collins.

341
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,198
<i>I've made an appointment for you
to see it tomorrow at 11:00.</i>

342
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,920
I'm not looking
for another apartment, Mother.

343
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,157
Once I'm better,
I'll fix this place up. It'll be fine.

344
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,750
You can at least look at it.
If you don't like it, he's got others.

345
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,959
And here.
I called the department at Columbia.

346
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,795
I've got you an appointment with the top
psychopharmacologist in the state.

347
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,349
He also happens to specialize
in depression.

348
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,633
I'm not depressed, Mother, I'm separated.

349
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,916
Oh, God, there's one.

350
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,957
Are you going to have to shave my head?

351
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,634
- Shave your head? What for?
- Lice.

352
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,791
They're going around at Annie's school.

353
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,157
You're pulling.
Oh, my God, they're everywhere.

354
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,038
What's next, Julia? Scabies?

355
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,749
How much further down do you have
to go before this stops? Shitter's Alley?

356
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,038
You don't have to be a member
of a third world country to get lice.

357
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,352
They're not a sign of uncleanliness.

358
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,035
They're not what I would call
a status symbol. You never had them.

359
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,670
Honey, take your clothes off
and throw them on the bathroom floor.

360
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,910
I'll be in to run the water.

361
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,239
Do you think you could help me
to strip the bed?

362
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,475
Just put all the pillow cases
and the sheets in a pile.

363
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,631
They have to be washed separately.

364
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,235
What do you say
we just toss the whole mess out?

365
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,392
No, it'll be fine.
I'll just wash it in hot water.

366
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,194
You really want your daughter
to risk recontamination?

367
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,078
- Linens cost money.
- My treat.

368
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,150
Mommy.

369
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,278
Just put the laundry
in a goddamn pile, okay?

370
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,113
Fine. Do everything the hard way.

371
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,949
<i>It's not enough to swim across the ocean.</i>

372
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,636
You have to do with 20-pound boulder
strapped to your back.

373
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,599
Oh, God. I think I felt one.

374
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,991
- Mother, you don't have lice.
- Where Annie put her head.

375
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,195
Mommy.

376
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,998
Something is crawling through my hair.

377
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,709
Mother, why don't you
just go back to your hotel room...

378
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,232
and have a nice hot bath.
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

379
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,669
Actually, the conference called.
My schedule's been changed.

380
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,197
I have to leave in the morning.

381
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,558
Mommy, are you coming?

382
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,309
You go and take care of yourself.

383
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,918
At least that's one thing
you've always been good at.

384
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,349
Excuse me.

385
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,958
Do you see a blind girl sitting over there,
by herself?

386
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,555
I see her. The one you were sitting with?

387
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,389
Right. Is she hot?

388
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,353
She's attractive, yes.

389
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,910
Well, can you give me a number?
Is she an eight, a nine?

390
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,152
Well, how's her body?
Does she have a good pair of tits?

391
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,193
You want the truth?

392
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,793
She's got to be
at least 10, 15 years older than you.

393
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,632
- What a liar. She told me she was 30.
- Old women lie about their age.

394
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,117
She thought she could get away with it
because you were blind.

395
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,556
Screw her. Do me a favor, will you?

396
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,189
Tell her my mother had a stroke
and I had to leave.

397
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,636
- That's the best you can do?
- She's the one who lied, not me.

398
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,112
Was I right about the salmon?

399
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,669
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you.

400
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,074
Really?

401
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,150
I'm not here spying on people.
I'm with someone.

402
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,479
Not anymore.

403
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,032
Thank God. What an asshole.

404
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,113
All he talked about was what
his last girlfriend said about his body.

405
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,393
Why didn't you tell me
that your blind date was blind?

406
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,629
Was he?

407
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,199
You didn't ask, and I don't consider
blindness to be a defining characteristic.

408
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,918
Why are you here?

409
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,875
Protect you from bastards. Like me.

410
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,352
Well, you can go now.

411
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,959
I don't want to.

412
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,716
It feels good,
your not being able to see me.

413
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,318
Like I'm a blank slate.

414
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,152
Tabula rasa.

415
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,437
No preconceptions.

416
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,074
Give me your hand.

417
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,072
Did you know that everybody
has their own special scent?

418
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,833
And that each scent
has three distinct parts.

419
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,389
Or, as we say in the biz, notes.

420
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,433
- No kidding.
- No kidding.

421
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,676
There's a top note, a middle note,
and a base note.

422
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,274
Most people are only aware
of their top notes.

423
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,591
How they want to be perceived,
their image.

424
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,590
The middle layer is a buffer...

425
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,630
to keep the external highs
away from the forbidden lows.

426
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,075
Why forbidden?

427
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,194
Because it's what people
are most afraid of. Their true selves.

428
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,069
So what am I afraid of?
I already know I'm a bastard.

429
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,873
Are you sure?

430
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,113
Maybe...

431
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,672
you're afraid of finding out
you're not the bastard you think you are.

432
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,073
I see...

433
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,795
someone kind...

434
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,234
and gentle...

435
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,594
and scared.

436
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,716
I think maybe you're the one
who needs to be rescued.

437
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,712
What are you doing?

438
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,719
Just looking.

439
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,830
Close your eyes.
I want you to really see me.

440
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,073
You're so beautiful.

441
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,755
Annie's pretty pooped.

442
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,878
She ran straight to her room
to lie down before dinner.

443
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,958
You're later than usual.

444
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,354
I had to stop and get a few things.

445
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,719
We had a rough night.

446
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,589
Here.

447
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,352
Anti-lice shampoo?

448
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,636
It has chemical insecticides in it,
so use it sparingly.

449
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,951
- Annie has lice?
- Had lice, hopefully.

450
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,829
You leave it on for about 10 minutes
and then rinse.

451
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,353
How did she get lice?

452
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,069
There are 32 students in her class, Sean.
It happens.

453
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,711
Aren't you going to say anything?

454
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,709
Our daughter has lice.
What else would you like me to say?

455
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,110
About my breasts. I had them done.

456
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,432
Your mother told me.

457
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,750
- Would you like to see them?
- No.

458
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,353
I'd like you to.

459
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,398
I think Dr. Copley did a good job, but...

460
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,032
I'd feel better if you looked at them,
just to make sure.

461
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,388
The symmetry's excellent.
Sloping's natural.

462
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,080
Peri-areolar incision. That was smart.

463
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,876
Dr. Copley's a professional.

464
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,796
She knows what she's doing.

465
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,792
Do you like them?

466
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,277
It doesn't matter what I think.

467
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,309
It's how the patient feels
about themselves.

468
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,478
Screw you, Sean.

469
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,872
I don't care what you think.

470
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,630
I don't care what anybody thinks.

471
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,359
Oh, God.

472
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,950
