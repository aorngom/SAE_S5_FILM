1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,268
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,350
Can I help you?

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,478
I'd like to test the paternity of my son.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,671
<i>I thought the answer
would change my life.</i>

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,752
<i>Now I'm not sure that it has to,
or that it should.</i>

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,873
Just because you know
doesn't mean that anybody else has to.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,349
Gina tracked down
Wilber's biological father.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,238
A blood test
Confirmed paternity...

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,472
and now he's decided to align himself
with her in the custody hearing.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,110
Gina's had 292 sexual partners
in the last three years.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,550
She's not fit to be this baby's mother.

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,995
Yes.

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,436
Wilber, I baptize thee,
in the name of the Father...

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,590
and the Son...

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,670
and the Holy Spirit.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,876
<i>I'd like
to hold my son now, James.</i>

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,712
He's not your son, Christian.

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,474
He's mine.

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,195
What are you saying, James?
That you're taking Wilber home with you?

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,510
- Yes.
- I won't let that happen.

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,954
<i>I'm sorry, Christian.</i>

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,394
<i>Deeply sorry.</i>

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,037
<i>Hey.
Hey, babe. I'm on my way.</i>

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,110
<i>We need anything?</i>

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,675
I'm buried in the mysteries
of the adrenal gland.

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,796
<i>Can you pick up takeout for dinner?</i>

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,110
<i>I was thinking lime AJ's lime chicken.</i>

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,598
Didn't we have lime chicken on Monday?

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,239
Then get garlic chicken.

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,197
How about the orange chicken?

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,309
Sean McNamara.

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,479
Oh, my God!

33
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,472
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,835
- Is he all right?
- Miraculously, yes.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,353
Sean.

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,272
This is why I've been nagging at you...

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,715
to get a hands-free thing
for your car phone.

38
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,633
Wouldn't have made a difference.
The guy ran a stop sign.

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,030
Doesn't change the fact
that you could've died.

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,111
Hey. This is my patient.

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,032
And he's my partner and best friend.

42
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,794
Why would I leave his mug
in your inexperienced hands?

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,394
I have pubic hairs that are older than you.

44
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,312
You need a few days off.

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,994
- I can handle the farm.
- Christian, I'm fine.

46
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,318
Is that why you let me put
three sutures in without Novocain?

47
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,198
You're in shock.

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,914
It's a normal response to sudden trauma.

49
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,355
I know what shock is, Christian,
and I'm not in it.

50
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,317
Then where's your other shoe?

51
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,876
Dr. McNamara, I'm Officer Strand.

52
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,076
I need a report,
when you're up to it.

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,710
We've got plenty of witnesses
who say it was the other guy's fault.

54
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,235
- How is the other guy?
- He didn't make it.

55
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,070
He died in the O. R. a few minutes ago.

56
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,952
That's a mistake. I saw him
walk out of his car, he was fine.

57
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,829
Internal bleeding or something.
I'm not a doctor.

58
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,997
Where's my baby, asshole?

59
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,314
I could call the cops.

60
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,118
This is kidnapping!

61
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,031
James has him. He's suing for full custody.

62
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,434
Full custody?

63
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,314
From me?
Congratulations, Gina.

64
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,755
In your pathetic attempt
to screw with me...

65
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,151
you handed Wilber to the one person
who can actually take him from us.

66
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,878
He can't do that.

67
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,669
You can't take a baby away
from its mother.

68
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,193
Oh, God!

69
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,156
Christian, what are we going to do?

70
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,590
Don't. This is your fault.

71
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,074
You're the selfish prick
who didn't have the decency...

72
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,674
to turn the three of us into a real family.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,230
Why aren't you
at your lawyer's office fighting this?

74
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,630
It's a little late for that.

75
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,353
As you keep reminding me,
I don't have any legal rights...

76
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,195
and I gave James enough dirt on you
to have the state tie your tubes.

77
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,270
We're done. He's gone.

78
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,395
So that's it.

79
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,994
You're just packing up his shit
and moving on?

80
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,993
Isn't that so typical?

81
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,277
Don't you have any feelings for Wilber?

82
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,432
If I were to stab you in the heart,
would I hit ice?

83
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,552
- I love that kid.
- Then why aren't you fighting for him?

84
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,194
You're so scared
to get your dick lopped off...

85
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,794
that you won't stick it out
for your own son.

86
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,671
- Hey.
- Hey.

87
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,071
The sound is giving me a headache.

88
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,559
Sorry.

89
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,999
How are you doing?

90
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,314
Good. A few aches and pains.

91
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,511
When Mom told me
you got into an accident...

92
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,830
I didn't breathe
until I saw you with my own eyes.

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,231
If I wasn't wearing a seatbelt,
you might've had to see me in a coffin.

94
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,119
That's why I'm always on your ass
to buckle up.

95
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,913
What are you reading?

96
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,476
<i>Consumer Reports Auto Safety Guide.</i>

97
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,837
We're gonna have to get a new car.

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,072
Let me guess, another Audi,
or a Volvo wagon.

99
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,751
There's nothing wrong with a car
that's designed to extend your life.

100
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,275
Yes, there is,
if that's all it's designed to do.

101
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,998
What's that supposed to mean?

102
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,594
Nothing. We just see things differently,
that's all.

103
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,274
You like the family Truckster...

104
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,796
and I like Christian's Ferrari.

105
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,995
Let's face it Dad, not even Christian
can get laid in a Volvo wagon.

106
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,272
You think I'm a pussy.

107
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,271
- I didn't say that.
- You're wrong.

108
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,679
I'm very bold.

109
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,790
Come on, Dad.

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,231
You could write a book
on the dangers of mundane situations.

111
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,074
I'm the only kid I know of
who never had the carpets...

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,310
in his house cleaned
because of Yamaha Syndrome.

113
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,233
It's Kawasaki Syndrome
and it's a very real issue.

114
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,472
Overly stripped carpet fibers
are havens for dust mites.

115
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,632
Children can get
very serious lung ailments from them.

116
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,833
Did you e-mail that car company?

117
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,031
Yes. I wanted to thank them.

118
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,112
Their safety features saved my life.

119
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,352
Must have been a pretty good e-mail.
They're on the phone.

120
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,438
The car company
forwards us any consumer feedback...

121
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,352
like that thank-you e-mail that you sent.

122
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,273
One of our guys flagged you
as a local plastic surgeon...

123
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,273
and we figured we'd bring you in.
We want your expertise.

124
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,112
I'm sorry. For what?

125
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,039
Climb in.

126
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,634
Dr. McNamara...

127
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,995
luxury cars are loaded
with safety features.

128
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,593
You could fill this car with eggs...

129
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,399
and crash it at 40 miles per hour
without breaking one shell.

130
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,312
Impressive.
Not perfect.

131
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,233
That cut on your face,
happens all the time.

132
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,311
<i>Blunt force trauma caused by the airbags.</i>

133
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,471
Muslin-skinned dummies
can't tell us anymore...

134
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,518
what really happens to people
when this safety stuff hits them.

135
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,432
Then what do you use?

136
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,994
The bodies come from
a special donor program.

137
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,714
You read those crash-test results
before you buy a car?

138
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,030
Religiously.
So does everyone else.

139
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,555
If we don't get our results in
before publication...

140
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,837
we don't get in the report,
and then people don't buy our cars.

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,594
<i>We've got 10 days
before the fall deadline...</i>

142
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,512
and we've just lost our medical expert...

143
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,717
due to work-related stresses.

144
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,316
Okay. There are freak cases,
one in a million...

145
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,075
when the bags balloon out
in a funny angle...

146
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,318
and decapitate the driver.

147
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,317
It happened to one of the cadavers.
Kind of spooked the doc.

148
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,114
What would the job entail?

149
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,111
Examining the bodies after we mash them.

150
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,953
Looking for the hidden bumps
and bruises...

151
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,838
so that we can recalibrate our systems...

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,788
and make sure that we're treating
our paying customers more kindly.

153
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,077
And we'd throw in a free car.

154
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,514
Top-of-the-line model.

155
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,353
Navigation, XM Satellite Radio,
hands-free phone.

156
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,071
My wife would certainly love that.

157
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,713
Do you want to hit the B. O. D.?

158
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,677
- The B. O. D.?
- Button of Death.

159
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,514
I named it.

160
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,069
You okay?

161
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,310
Brody, go get the doc something
from the machine.

162
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,754
No. I'm fine.

163
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,309
But I'm sorry, Mr. Kintner,
I'm gonna have to turn down your offer.

164
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,756
What happened?
Rental car wouldn't start?

165
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,275
I told you to upgrade
to the premium model.

166
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,876
I couldn't drive.
I couldn't even put the car in gear.

167
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,433
I was frozen.

168
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,477
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

169
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,877
I didn't go to war, Christian.
I had a car accident.

170
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,998
Your brain doesn't care
if it was a bullet or a Yugo.

171
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,878
You faced death.

172
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,955
You know the worst part of it?
How familiar it all feels.

173
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,671
Being afraid to even move.

174
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,636
I've felt that way most of my life.

175
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,592
- What are you afraid of?
- I don't know.

176
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,189
Dying.

177
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,674
Is that all?

178
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,749
What's all that?

179
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,356
Wilber's stuff from my apartment.
I'm giving it to charity.

180
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,559
Getting rid of evidence doesn't mean
you can eradicate memories, Christian.

181
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,549
Deciding to raise a baby
that wasn't my own...

182
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,790
was the worst mistake of my life.

183
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,311
And I have an impressive list.

184
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,151
I just want it all to go away.

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,195
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself.

186
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,839
229 feet.

187
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,273
<i>That's the distance between
the bottom of the Hillary Step...</i>

188
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,317
and the summit at 29,029.

189
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,031
That's where I donated my nose
and half my fingers to Chomolungma...

190
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,473
the Mother Goddess of the World.

191
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,875
Mount Everest.

192
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,757
We got pinned down
for two hours there in a storm.

193
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,114
Do you have a picture
of what your face looked like...

194
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,396
before it suffered frostbite trauma?

195
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,269
Here.

196
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,389
They're what got me off the hill.

197
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,915
<i>Just the thought of a graduation
or a wedding dance...</i>

198
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,877
<i>can get you through anything.</i>

199
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,759
Not to be too personal, Mr. Gideon,
but with such a large family to support...

200
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,751
why did you risk the climb
in the first place?

201
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,956
I was a medic in the Special Forces...

202
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,951
I'd jumped out of helicopters.

203
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,751
<i>Then I met my wife, had my kids...</i>

204
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,514
<i>and got a job
as a high-school guidance counselor...</i>

205
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,195
and for the first time in my life
I felt scared.

206
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,193
What were you scared of?

207
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,952
Losing who I was.

208
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,191
<i>But when you are ticking off the years
past 40 and the sailing is smooth...</i>

209
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,910
suddenly you realize,
statistically speaking...

210
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,038
I'm closer to the end of my life
than I am to the beginning.

211
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,111
I decided I wanted my kids...

212
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,757
to grow up with the memory
of a father who had lived his life...

213
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,435
rather than a shell of a man
who surrendered to fear.

214
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,920
So I started climbing mountains.

215
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,277
Mr. Gideon, to repair your injuries,
we'll need to remove the dead tissue...

216
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,434
and then graft skin
from a harvest site on your body.

217
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,797
If we do our job correctly,
there'll be minimal scarring.

218
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,391
Small price to pay for the rush
of being on top of the world.

219
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,434
What happens now that you've lost
the ability to get that rush?

220
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,194
Lost it, my ass. I'm going back.

221
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,631
That ice-covered bitch took my nose,
I'm taking her summit.

222
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,510
Not to be a fatalist, but what if you don't?

223
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,797
You know, freezing to death
isn't that bad of a way to go.

224
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,396
Seriously, your body goes numb
so there's no pain.

225
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,836
The way I felt up on that hill,
during that storm...

226
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,637
my body was totally numb...

227
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,271
but on the inside I was on fire.

228
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,438
I'd take a numb nose
over a numb soul any day.

229
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,117
Get your coat
and your bitch on.

230
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,077
We're meeting with my lawyer in an hour.

231
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,674
They aren't taking our son without a fight.

232
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,590
Mr. Kintner. About that free car...

233
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,469
I'm a big fan of night blue.

234
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,479
His name was Mike. Big Mike.

235
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,678
Best buddy in the world.

236
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,838
We worked here
loading the masher together, 10 years.

237
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,840
This is my going-away present
for him.

238
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,075
I figured a guy who never did
anything exciting his entire life...

239
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,589
deserved one good thrill
before we put him in the ground.

240
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,598
How did you get away with that?

241
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,752
Fudged some paperwork
and got him into the program.

242
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,199
Mike and I were the presidents...

243
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,276
of the "gonna" club.

244
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,035
As in we were gonna do a lot of things.

245
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,832
Since we started putting
real people in the masher...

246
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,632
it was like, "Damn, it could be us. "

247
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,872
We decided to do something.

248
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,949
Something that just scared
the piss out of us.

249
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,756
Like what?

250
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,274
Shark diving?
Mikey and I were scared of sharks.

251
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,749
<i>Me, too. Ever since I saw Jaws.</i>

252
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,072
You mind if I hit the B. O. D., Doc?

253
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,634
No, please.

254
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,671
Ride of your life, Mikey.

255
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,435
Low-grade abrasions
around the thorax and lower extremities.

256
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,593
One-inch scrape along the clavicle
indicating blunt force trauma.

257
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,750
Small laceration of the left cheek...

258
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,073
just below the eye.

259
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,198
First, I want to thank all of you
for agreeing to go to arbitration on this.

260
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,595
<i>Court cases can be ugly and expensive.</i>

261
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,072
Just so we're all clear, is there no way
I can convince you to share custody?

262
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,311
We live 3,000 miles away.

263
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,234
Joint custody is not an option.

264
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,593
But you're asking for more
than just full custody, Mr. Sutherland.

265
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,034
<i>You want closed custody.</i>

266
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,953
You don't want the mother involved
in the child's life at all.

267
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,350
I assume you've read
the information we provided...

268
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,078
about Ms. Russo's sexual addiction.

269
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,912
I'm in recovery.

270
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,918
How was that recovery going
when you had unprotected sex...

271
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,275
with my husband at the airport Ramada?

272
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,519
Gina is working hard
to deal with her illness.

273
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,830
Have you seen the recommendation
from her SA sponsor?

274
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,436
And the one from my shrink.
I have.

275
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,160
In terms of testimonials,
those good ones...

276
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,195
are outweighed by the numerous
less flattering affidavits...

277
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,910
from your and Ms. Russo's extensive list
of former acquaintances.

278
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,074
What kind of man is this child
going to grow up to be...

279
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,276
if he has one parent
who sees commitment...

280
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,715
as something that ends
when the martini wears off...

281
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,031
and the other who sees herself
as no more than a sexual receptacle?

282
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,952
There is no need to be cruel.

283
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,550
Don't you dare defend her in front of me.

284
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,154
You want this baby, I'm getting it for you.

285
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,715
Not that I don't want him, too.

286
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,157
Listen, role models come in many forms.

287
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,559
Yes, Gina is flawed.

288
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,394
But she's working hard
to overcome her illness.

289
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,879
Who are you?

290
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,235
Excuse me?

291
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,391
You're not her husband or her boyfriend.

292
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,199
<i>From what my husband tells me,
you don't even like her.</i>

293
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,351
<i>You're not the child's father, so...</i>

294
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,873
why are you here?

295
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,513
It's a fair question.

296
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,116
Doctor, even if I were to grant custody
to Ms. Russo...

297
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,669
you would have to deal
with the adoption process...

298
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,513
before you had any legal parental rights.

299
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,718
I never had a real father.

300
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,957
I never had someone love me...

301
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,076
so much that he risked
changing his life for me...

302
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,033
like I have for Wilber.

303
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,599
I love him.

304
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,512
I love him
more than I've ever loved anyone...

305
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,353
or anything in my life.

306
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,999
Cicely's right.

307
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,909
I've held hundreds of women in my bed...

308
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,039
and counted the minutes
till the sun came up...

309
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,271
and I could get rid of them.

310
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,471
But when it's late at night...

311
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,917
and that little boy is asleep in my arms...

312
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,558
I wish the Earth could just...

313
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,559
freeze there forever.

314
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,680
You're right, sweetie. Frisky's pregnant.

315
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,838
I'm gonna be a mommy.

316
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,876
- So?
- It's a massive tumor.

317
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,389
As difficult as it may be,
we're going to have to tell her the truth.

318
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,519
Can't we let her celebrate life a little
before she has to deal with death?

319
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,955
Hey. Thank you.

320
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,236
Okay, goodnight.

321
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,635
Jesus, Jules. How about a little variety?

322
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,910
With your sensitive stomach, Sean...

323
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,196
there are only so many places
we can order from.

324
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,193
I don't have a sensitive stomach.
Right.

325
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,112
Do you remember
when Christian took us...

326
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,953
to that cool Vietnamese restaurant
and all you ate was rice?

327
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,714
- And you still had diarrhea.
- It was a bug!

328
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,555
Dad, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

329
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,995
You just like what you like, that's all.

330
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,268
Okay, that's it.

331
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,713
We're not wasting one more night
of our lives eating the same bland chicken.

332
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,038
This family is gonna start
experiencing life.

333
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,032
Well, where're we gonna go?

334
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,873
Somewhere where they don't
serve chicken.

335
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,588
You drive.

336
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,349
Who do you think could win in a fight?
A shark or a bear?

337
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,957
A shark, definitely.

338
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,998
Shark talk freaking you out, Dad?

339
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,232
Four California rolls, four spicy tuna rolls...

340
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,870
- four spicy yellowtail...
- Sorry, no Chicken of the Sea, Jules.

341
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,797
Two sea urchin, two live baby shrimp,
two giant clam.

342
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,994
Excuse me. What is this here?

343
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,639
<i>Fugu. Blowfish.</i>

344
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,033
Isn't that the stuff that can kill you
if it's not made right?

345
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,509
Very uncommon.
There's poison in the spikes.

346
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,638
Bad chef and...
But our chefs are very good.

347
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,757
- Let's try it.
- Stop joking around, Sean.

348
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,639
I'm serious. She said the chefs were good.

349
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,351
Come on. There's a big difference between
shaking things up and killing yourself.

350
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,478
Relax. He's just screwing with us.

351
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,278
<i>Bring us an order of fugu.</i>

352
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,391
<i>Fugu!</i>

353
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,072
Did you have an MRI after the accident?
Because I think you have brain damage.

354
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,356
Not damage. Awareness.

355
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,188
Excuse me.

356
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,516
Enough. This isn't funny.

357
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,036
Come on. We're taking a bigger risk
by driving home.

358
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,358
- What do you think?
- I'll try it if you will.

359
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,954
You're not eating it because we're leaving.

360
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,951
<i>It's one thing to put yourself in danger.</i>

361
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,351
Encouraging your children
to do the same thing is over the line.

362
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,238
<i>Come on, Annie, Matt.</i>

363
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,798
It's pretty bold, Dad.

364
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,513
Don't die or anything.

365
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,398
Not on your life.

366
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,633
See you.

367
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,519
Excuse me.

368
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,230
How long does it take for the symptoms
to kick in if something goes wrong?

369
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,630
The chef leaves some blowfish toxin in.

370
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,836
<i>Just enough so your lips
and tongue feel numb.</i>

371
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,956
It's called "the taste of death. "

372
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,038
Poison works fast, though.

373
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,589
15 seconds go by
and you feel nothing but the taste...

374
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,909
you're A-okay.

375
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,436
They bill it as Shark Alley.
It's a feeding channel off the keys.

376
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,034
Are funeral expenses included
in the price?

377
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,749
They've only had one incident
and that guy was irritating the sharks.

378
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,036
How does one irritate a shark?

379
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,155
You wanna be bold?
Start slow.

380
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,311
Wear some flat-front pants.

381
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,793
So what you're saying
is you're a pussy.

382
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,191
There's a difference between
being a pussy and respecting fear.

383
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,430
It reminds me
to slide on a johnny hat...

384
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,639
every time I perform a slip-in-dick-tomy
on a woman of questionable standards.

385
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,435
Look, Sean.

386
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,318
I'm allowed to take risks.

387
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,155
<i>I don't have a wife and kid to leave behind
if something goes wrong.</i>

388
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,750
Taking risks is easy
when you're alone.

389
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,633
Dr. Troy?

390
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,234
Ms. Russo's on the phone.
The decision came down.

391
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,158
Good morning, everyone.

392
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,795
Coming to a decision has been difficult.

393
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,315
On the one hand,
I have Mr. and Mrs. Sutherland.

394
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,552
You've raised
three successful sons.

395
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,595
But chasing around a toddler at 60
is different than chasing one around at 30.

396
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,992
<i>I also question Mrs. Sutherland's desire
to raise Wilber at all.</i>

397
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,600
On the other hand I have Dr. Troy.

398
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,113
Your unconditional love
for Wilber is obvious.

399
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,756
But unfortunately, all emotion aside...

400
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,434
you have no legal right
to parenting the child.

401
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,117
<i>So it comes down to Ms. Russo.</i>

402
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,638
<i>You are the child's biological mother.</i>

403
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,799
And you're the only one...

404
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,872
with whom I fear Wilber
could be in physical danger.

405
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,713
Frankly, I fear for his life
if he remains with you.

406
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,512
I'm granting the Sutherlands' request
for custody of the child.

407
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,193
What?

408
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,830
But, that's my baby. That's our baby.

409
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,560
Ms. Russo and Dr. Troy
will not be allowed contact...

410
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,870
that is not initiated
by Mr. and Mrs. Sutherland...

411
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,190
until the child is 18 years of age.

412
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,874
You can't do that.
That's not the law. It's...

413
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,956
Christian, do something.

414
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,759
<i>Loss is a part of life.</i>

415
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,359
You can't really care for something
or someone...

416
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,512
until you realize that one day,
they may be gone.

417
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,875
And when they do go...

418
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,634
we feel as if everything goes with them...

419
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,869
and we feel like we'll never really care
about anything again.

420
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,189
But we do.

421
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,872
And we discover that
that loss was a gift...

422
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,909
that helps us appreciate
all of the things we still have.

423
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,950
Should we push the dirt on now?

424
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,758
Yes, sweetheart.

425
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,638
Why don't you go and comfort Frisky Two?

426
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,916
It wasn't even about me.

427
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,996
Gina was the deal-breaker.

428
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,354
I lost him.

429
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,916
Christian.

430
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,150
I am so sorry.

431
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,675
I know that feeling of loss.

432
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,875
It's how I felt after the miscarriage.

433
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,033
I know you can't believe it now...

434
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,839
but one day, you'll feel better,
stronger and you...

435
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,878
Thank you, but
the "sun will come out tomorrow" crap...

436
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,270
isn't gonna cut it today.

437
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,071
You lost a zygote.

438
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,356
Wilber was my son.

439
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,195
Appease me with platitudes
when you've experienced...

440
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,396
some real loss in your life.

441
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,071
I think Julia's miscarriage
and my father leaving when I was five...

442
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,071
was experience enough.

443
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,790
I can see it's had a big effect
on your life, Aquaman.

444
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,560
<i>You're making sure
your kids don't have to experience...</i>

445
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,711
the same kind of loss, aren't you?

446
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,077
I understand that you're hurting...

447
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,549
but lashing out
isn't gonna make you feel any better.

448
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,393
Wait a minute. Aquaman?
I don't understand.

449
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,114
Captain Nemo didn't tell you...

450
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,078
about his dick-swinging competition
on Saturday?

451
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,477
I'm going shark diving this weekend.
I was gonna tell you tonight.

452
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,996
Is your goal to have us crying
over your coffin, Sean?

453
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,756
How can you be such a hypocrite?

454
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,672
<i>Didn't you listen to your own eulogy?</i>

455
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,115
"What's the use of living
if you don't embrace life?"

456
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,396
What the hell is the matter with you?

457
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,472
Pushing your luck
is no way to raise a family!

458
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,676
Don't come into my house and lecture me
on the subtleties of parenting.

459
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,469
You were a father for six months.
I've been one for 16 years.

460
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,354
I may have only been a father
for a few months...

461
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,192
but one thing I am dead sure about...

462
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,794
is that fatherhood's
not about proving to your family...

463
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,678
that you've got steel balls.

464
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,717
It's about taking care of them...

465
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,237
keeping them safe, and making sure
they never feel the way I do right now.

466
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,836
You used to know that.

467
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,832
Just so you know,
in your quest to find yourself...

468
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,518
you're losing something.

469
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,793
My respect.

470
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,270
Are you really gonna do this?

471
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,957
Yes. And you're coming with me.

472
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,553
Don't you have enough already?

473
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,109
There's gonna be 50 sharks down there.

474
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,876
Do you want them snacking on the chum
or on your leg?

475
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,836
I don't know what scares me more.
The sharks...

476
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,877
or Mom after she finds your note.

477
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,268
If you're freaked, we can bail.

478
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,317
Are you kidding? This rules.

479
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,912
Let's gear up, boys.

480
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,270
Brody, this is my son, Matt.

481
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,079
Hey.

482
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,316
Into the buffet line, fellas.

483
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,032
Ride of my life!

484
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,795
Dad!

485
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,275
Dad?

486
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,679
You ready to go?

487
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,910
We're not going. Come on.

488
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,114
What are you doing?

489
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,316
I'm being a responsible parent.

490
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,354
I know you're scared, but...

491
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,317
Sometimes being scared is a good thing.

492
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,994
It's your brain telling you
not to do something stupid...

493
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,354
to prove something to your son.

494
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,671
Bullshit! Look, we're not gonna die.

495
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,755
You really are a pussy.

496
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,393
Call me what you want.

497
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,950
If it's a choice between losing your respect
or losing you, I'll keep you.

498
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,395
Quinn, diver in trouble.
Get him up.

499
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,949
Give us a hand!
Get him up the ladder!

500
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,758
All right, get him up here.

501
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,076
He got down to 25 feet
and he freaked.

502
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,832
He shot to the surface like a rocket.

503
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,309
Get the divers up. Pull anchor.

504
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,710
Something don't feel right, Doc.

505
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,079
Holy shit.

506
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,756
He's got an arterial gas embolism.
Get his feet up.

507
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,554
Can you regulate that
to give him 15 liters per minute?

508
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,193
You got it.

509
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,752
Is he gonna die?

510
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,194
If he can't get to a hospital...

511
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,432
with a hyperbaric oxygen chamber
within an hour, he might.

512
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,560
Never give a girl your number.

513
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,439
Always take hers. Keeps you in control.

514
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,310
And no American cars. German, Italian...

515
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,040
or the occasional English.

516
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,149
Treat yourself to a barber-shop shave
once a month.

517
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,869
Take a beautiful girl to Florence
and eat at Enoteca.

518
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,953
Talk to Marino. He'll take care of you.

519
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,513
Tell him you're my son.

520
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,796
Don't take any crap off anyone.

521
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,551
You're better than that.

522
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,154
Try to be good to people.

523
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,075
Never get too jaded to care.

524
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,311
Remember me.

525
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,595
Just a second.

526
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,673
Just one more second.

527
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,792
You wanna come in?

528
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,479
Yeah, but, we should go.

529
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,038
<i>We have a 6:00 flight.</i>

530
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,239
You guys good?

531
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,553
Thanks for this.

532
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,354
I figured you deserved an hour
after all you did for him.

533
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,559
If you ask me, you saved his life.

534
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,719
May I?

535
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,678
I hope you understand...

536
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,116
we're serious about enforcing
the no-contact thing.

537
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,957
Cicely and I think
it's what's best for Gabriel.

538
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,437
That's what we're calling him.

539
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,109
Say goodbye, Gabriel.

540
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,789
Bye.

541
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,395
You have nothing
to be ashamed of, Brody.

542
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,437
At least you went in.

543
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,432
Look, I gotta run.

544
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,676
Call me when you get out of the hospital.

545
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,193
All right.

546
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,754
Is he gonna be all right?

547
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,194
He'll live.

548
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,954
Listen...

549
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,398
I wanna apologize
for what I said to you on the boat.

550
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,916
About you being a pussy and all that.

551
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,112
You don't need to impress me.
You're my dad.

552
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,953
That used to be enough.

553
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,471
When you were a kid,
I could wow you with state capitals.

554
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,797
I'm still wowed by you.

555
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,430
What you did for that guy on the boat?

556
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,712
It was amazing.

557
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,673
What are you writing?

558
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,359
My obituary.

559
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,749
I read somewhere that writing your own
was a good motivational tool.

560
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,558
And what does it say?

561
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,835
"Dr. Sean McNamara, 101 years old...

562
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,991
"died Tuesday night of natural causes.

563
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,674
"Inventor of bipolar liposuction.

564
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,793
"He was described by his friends
and large family as a good doctor...

565
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,119
- "good husband... "
- And a good father.

566
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,551
Where's Mom?
Is she still pissed about the trip?

567
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,794
What trip?

568
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,473
Is that the note?

569
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,438
What she doesn't know
won't hurt her, or us.

570
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,117
Dude. We cheated death.

571
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,118
Thanks, Julia, but I'm not hungry.

572
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,919
You asked me to come around
and make you feel better. This is step one.

573
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,198
I shouldn't have called.

574
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,353
I think I just didn't wanna be alone.

575
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,835
The place feels so empty with him gone.

576
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,835
I keep thinking I hear him in the bedroom.

577
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,109
This is what happens
when you let people in.

578
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,476
Don't shut off, Christian.

579
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,355
You can still have other children.

580
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,599
I want him.

581
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,271
I want my son.

582
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,317
But he's gone.

583
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,751
You can't let that scare you away...

584
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,916
from loving another child.

585
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,478
What do you know about real fear?

586
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,120
<i>Losing a ring down the garbage disposal
isn't the same...</i>

587
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,239
as a court telling you
you can't see Annie again.

588
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,279
Have some stranger tear Matt
literally from your arms...

589
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,555
and then tell me that a new son
is gonna replace the one that I lost!

590
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,195
I feel dead inside.

591
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,476
Nothing's getting me back from this.

592
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,479
I'm sorry.

593
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,111
I just miss him so much.

594
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,633
What's wrong?

595
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,197
I can't do this anymore. It's killing me.

596
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,274
I feel like I am being stalked
by a huge bear.

597
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,958
I keep pretending it's not there...

598
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,431
and hoping it'll go away
but it just keeps following me.

599
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,271
I don't understand.

600
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,075
What if I told you...

601
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,310
that you already had a son?

602
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,275
What?

603
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,833
You already have a son, Christian.

604
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,839
With me.

605
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,470
Matt.

606
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,670
