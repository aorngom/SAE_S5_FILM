1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,870
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,837
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,197
I want a face-lift. Age is what mutilates.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,913
It was a hit-and-run, Henry.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,197
Hey, don't do anything stupid.
It's a little late for that.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,555
Won't your dad work on her face?
Won't he help us?

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,119
15-blade.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,150
<i>I have a yip.</i>

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,073
You operated on a patient knowing
it'd affect your performance?

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,229
What was I supposed to do?

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,550
If I can't operate, we can't operate.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,789
Oh, yeah.

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,279
Slow it down.

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,273
That's right.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,038
Now use both hands.

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,712
And don't be afraid
to use that either, sweetheart.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,710
I don't usually get so many notes
during a performance.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,877
- Am I not...
- Amazing.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,034
Absolutely.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,749
It might help more
if you paid me a little attention first.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,151
First come, first served.

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,392
Why didn't you say so?

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,634
Saddle up.

24
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,188
Oh, my God!

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,636
You like that, don't you?
Down?

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,271
Sweetheart, I can't go down
any further than I already am.

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,433
No. Down.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,231
I'm super allergic to...

29
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,317
The gall of her lawyer
to say the morphine made her do it.

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,268
Libby Zucker blew her best friend's head
off out of revenge. Pure and simple.

31
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,718
What's not simple is the week we have
to spend in court to clear up her mess.

32
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,756
What happened to you?
Husband come home early from work?

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,192
The model that was sitting on my face
this morning sneezed...

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,351
and jammed her pussy...
Christian!

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,751
With a mouth like that, she could've
done us a favor and broken his jaw.

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,354
I thought finally
we had something in common.

37
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,080
Isn't this what happened to your nose?

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,512
Where are you headed?

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,831
I got an operation at 9:00.

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,872
See you after surgery.

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,870
I'm fine. I haven't had a single tremor
in 10 days.

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,669
The neurologist verified it was a symptom
of psychosis triggered by anxiety.

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,991
Not surprisingly, now that
my mother-in-law's face-lift is over...

44
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,798
so is the anxiety.

45
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,472
Welcome back, partner.

46
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,269
Can I...

47
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,116
Can I get a second opinion?

48
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,868
Up until now, the worst thing that's
happened to this face is a rough exfoliate.

49
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,076
I never even had a pimple as a kid.

50
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,629
Doesn't look like your orbits are involved.

51
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,917
Maybe just a deviated septum
along with a fractured nasal bone.

52
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,878
I'll reset it after surgery. You'll be fine.

53
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,719
Fine? This face? No.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,276
You gotta make it
what it was before, Sean: perfect.

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,871
I only do perfect. Remember?

56
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,354
Holy Mother of God,
it's the steatoma from hell.

57
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,910
That he couldn't afford to have
it removed, even at this stage...

58
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,672
We're doing him pro bono.

59
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,278
You ever lance one this big?
In a nightmare, once.

60
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,069
The quicker we get
Elephant Man out of here...

61
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,390
the quicker you can fix my nose.

62
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,352
Oh, my God!
He hit a pumper.

63
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,953
Vascular clamp.

64
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,633
He's tacking.

65
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,111
He's losing pressure, Sean.

66
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,869
I got it.

67
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,713
You got it?
Got it. I need a 5-0 Prolene.

68
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,515
What the hell
just happened, Sean?

69
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,159
Tell me what you
don't like about yourself.

70
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,599
If I'm gonna work on your nose...

71
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,354
I want to follow the same procedure
as for all our patients.

72
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,590
We're not here
to talk about my nose, Sean.

73
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,910
We're here to talk about
what happened at surgery.

74
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,991
Nothing happened. It was a minor mishap.

75
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,991
You call that river of blood "minor"?

76
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,436
Unger bucked from a bad anesthesia
reaction. It's happened before.

77
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,670
- Your hand palsied again.
- No, it didn't.

78
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,034
Bullshit!

79
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,238
Your problem is getting worse.

80
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,392
- It's not getting worse.
- So there is a problem.

81
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,074
Surgery is our livelihood, Christian.

82
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,758
Do you really think I'd hide something
from you serious enough to destroy it?

83
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,517
Let me take a look again.

84
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,149
Don't.

85
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,633
It hurts. That's all.

86
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,155
You don't trust me to reset your nose.

87
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,199
It's just a hairline fracture.
Surgery might be unnecessary.

88
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,191
What about your burning need
for perfection?

89
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,433
You're always saying that plastic surgeons
can't look worse than their patients.

90
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,955
I don't give a shit
what anybody else thinks.

91
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,272
What I care about is what you're gonna
say to Unger when he wakes up.

92
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,668
What's up?

93
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,799
Matt McNamara?

94
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,830
I'm Det. Collins.
This is Det. Volpey from Miami-Dade.

95
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,278
Are you aware that your friend,
Henry Shapiro, was arrested last night?

96
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,875
Henry? No, why?

97
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,749
Your name came up relating to a crime
involving Cara Fitzgerald.

98
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,229
We need you to answer some questions.

99
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,598
Two days ago, Henry attacked
and sexually assaulted Cara...

100
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,159
on her way home from school.

101
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,550
<i>She's in the hospital in serious condition.</i>

102
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,109
Henry's being held, pending charges.

103
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,554
Oh, my God.

104
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,670
That's terrible. I had no idea.

105
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,471
So that's your official story, Matt?

106
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,712
You don't know anything
about what happened to Cara Fitzgerald?

107
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,074
No.

108
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,309
Here's our contact information.
You can call us at any time.

109
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,036
You don't wanna lie to the police, Matt.

110
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,270
If we find out there's more to this story...

111
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,318
you could wind up in jail
right along with Henry.

112
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,956
How do you improve on that?

113
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,714
There are ways, believe me.

114
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,832
Can I ask how you...

115
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,718
Bedroom acrobatics.

116
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,990
- Are you here to get it reset?
- No, that's for wimps.

117
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,391
I'm here to consult
Dr. Jordan about a surgical technique.

118
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,551
She's a colleague of mine.

119
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,519
Consult?

120
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,478
She doesn't know how to operate,
or something?

121
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,712
Dr. Christian Troy.

122
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,679
Calvin Murray.

123
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,518
What you here for, Calvin?

124
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,033
It's kind of embarrassing.

125
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,270
The only thing
to be embarrassed about...

126
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,716
is not taking advantage
of a doctor's free advice.

127
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,431
Triple nipple. Very rare.

128
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,753
I'm betting you're here
because it affects your sex life.

129
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,558
If I had one, yeah.

130
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,474
I won't take my shirt off at the beach.

131
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,512
And you're about to take it off
in front of Dr. Jordan?

132
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,831
Let a chick in scrubs
poke around your chest?

133
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,789
Come by my office tomorrow at 9:00.

134
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,478
This says 10:00.

135
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,079
My waiting room is filled
with beautiful women...

136
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,549
like the one that just strolled out of here.

137
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,597
<i>If we're gonna really fix your problem...</i>

138
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,672
I'd like to make
a few introductions beforehand.

139
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,838
Awesome! Well, thanks, Dr. Troy.

140
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,549
My pleasure.

141
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,712
I'd leave before she comes,
or you may get charged for the visit.

142
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,518
Right. Cool.

143
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,915
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Great.

144
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,592
Dr. Troy. What a surprise!

145
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,108
Good to see you, Monica.

146
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,113
I couldn't believe it when I saw you
on my appointment sheet.

147
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,352
- What happened to your nose?
- That's why I'm here.

148
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,034
I broke it playing a game of hoops
with the boys.

149
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,112
I'm looking to get a rhinoplasty ASAP.
How's your schedule?

150
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,429
I don't understand.

151
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,639
You're partners with Sean McNamara.
Why is he not fixing it for you?

152
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,231
The scar is gonna feel tight for a while,
but otherwise you're healing nicely.

153
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,391
What do you think, Jess?

154
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,471
- I kind of miss it.
- Miss it?

155
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,793
It scared people.

156
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,678
It was a part of you.

157
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,397
I love you because of your flaws,
not despite them.

158
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,355
Can I get dressed now, Doc?
I gotta get back to work.

159
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,393
I'm afraid I can't let you leave just yet,
Mr. Unger.

160
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,551
There was a small complication
during surgery.

161
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,233
<i>You lost an excess amount of blood.</i>

162
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,073
We need to keep you here
for another day of observation.

163
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,992
- Liz?
- Another day?

164
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,991
Only as a precaution.

165
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,439
What happened?

166
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,080
You husband spasmed
during my initial incision.

167
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,470
A superficial artery was nicked.

168
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,432
I suspect it's because you had
an adverse reaction to the anesthesia.

169
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,835
I don't understand.
I don't feel weak or anything.

170
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,954
- I feel fine.
- That's what we wanna hear.

171
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,639
Sorry to interrupt...

172
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,758
but there's a gentleman in the lobby
who insists on seeing you.

173
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,239
It's about Matt.

174
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,518
So what did I do now?

175
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,558
Matt, Henry's father came by
to see me at the office today.

176
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,111
- He told me what happened to Cara.
- Why didn't you tell us?

177
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,069
I guess I didn't process it yet.

178
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,755
Henry's saying you were involved.

179
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,237
I didn't rape anybody.

180
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,670
That's not what Henry's saying.

181
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,310
He told his father you both hit Cara
with Henry's car six months ago...

182
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,879
and then left the scene.

183
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,157
What a guilty person will do
to deflect his crime.

184
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,515
To lie like that so blatantly!

185
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,474
His own father doesn't even believe him.

186
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,037
Wasn't that what he told you?
In so many words.

187
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,273
Henry's father did ask if you'd come in
to give a statement to his lawyer.

188
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,317
<i>Your side of the story.</i>

189
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,791
Are you okay with that?

190
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,911
I have to go get Annie.

191
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,069
What?

192
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,549
Did you have anything to do
with that hit-and-run?

193
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,071
How could you even ask me that?

194
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,630
I did find it odd that you begged me
to reconstruct the face of a girl...

195
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,916
I wasn't aware you knew
prior to the accident.

196
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,719
Do you really think
I could hide something from you...

197
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,633
that could destroy my whole life like that?

198
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,313
You know what, Dad, I'll tell my side
of the story to Henry's lawyer.

199
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,391
I'm sure he'll believe me.

200
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,593
Where's your partner?
I thought he'd be doing this.

201
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,513
I can assure you
you're in very good hands.

202
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,108
Do you know how Dr. Troy's consult
with that other surgeon went?

203
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,119
What other surgeon?

204
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,034
Dr. Jordan. We met in her office.
He was gonna show her how to operate.

205
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,636
Can you believe they let
incompetent doctors cut into people?

206
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,518
We're ready to prep him.

207
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,392
Mr. Murray, the ladies will escort you
to surgery. We'll begin momentarily.

208
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,717
You sure you don't
wanna check up on me?

209
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,678
Make sure I'm handling everything
all right?

210
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,152
Just a minute, Sean.
We gotta set the record straight.

211
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,276
I rechecked my numbers on Unger.

212
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,271
Even the BIS showed he was deep.

213
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,752
- Maybe you read the monitor wrong.
- Machines don't make mistakes, Sean.

214
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,588
People do.

215
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,031
You're here for prep early.

216
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,671
Why didn't you tell me you met
our triple nipple at Dr. Jordan's office?

217
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,997
You're gonna have her
do your rhinoplasty, aren't you?

218
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,678
That's right, I am.

219
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,555
You caught me red-handed, Sean.

220
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,712
I'm cheating on you.

221
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,440
This partnership is a goddamn joke.

222
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,990
I have one minor mishap
after 15 impeccable years of surgery...

223
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,276
and suddenly all your trust
swirls down the drain.

224
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,351
Don't forget whose talent
built this business.

225
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,069
Your talent? Let's take a look
at your record on talent, shall we?

226
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,232
You're the one who left the cautery tip
in Mrs. Grubman, not me.

227
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,153
You're the one
who failed the review boards, not me.

228
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,438
And you're the one who almost cut off
Unger's head the other day. Not me!

229
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,997
Is this gonna be pistols at 20 paces,
or is someone gonna get to work here?

230
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,951
What are you
waiting for, Sean?

231
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,392
Give me the scalpel.

232
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,157
Give me the scalpel, Sean.

233
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,108
Now leave.

234
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,955
I think you're meant to let a doctor
take off your bandages, Mother.

235
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,951
I am a doctor, darling.

236
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,237
I'm thrilled with the results.
Absolutely thrilled.

237
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,398
Is it painful?

238
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,431
Everything just throbs.

239
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,194
Did you drain your fluids today?
Sean said...

240
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,716
I was going to do that now,
if you'd give me a chance.

241
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,078
Here, let me help you.

242
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,357
Please. Hold up the mirror, will you?

243
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,550
What's wrong now?
Is this too disturbing for you?

244
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,356
What's disturbing me is some news I got
the other day about Matt's friend, Henry.

245
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,590
He raped a friend of theirs.

246
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,674
How old?
Sixteen, and so sweet.

247
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,110
I don't understand how a boy
who was so young and easygoing could...

248
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,477
Lose control like that.
Do you want my professional opinion?

249
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,835
Can't we pretend
we're having a conversation...

250
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,991
without dragging
your credentials into this?

251
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,594
I'll tell you exactly why he did it.

252
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,070
Children these days are under
the same pressure as adults are.

253
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,959
Society's constantly pushing them
toward perfection.

254
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,678
It's the parents' fault, really.

255
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,638
<i>All these baby boomers...</i>

256
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,076
<i>grew up with high expectations
of what life should be.</i>

257
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,949
<i>Then they woke up in middle age
and became unglued.</i>

258
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,030
- What do you mean?
- It's called transference.

259
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,672
<i>The parents never learned
how to deal with their own failures.</i>

260
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,230
<i>So they pass their unrealistic expectations
on to their kids.</i>

261
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,075
They put pressure on them
to excel in school and relationships.

262
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,958
And it's too much.

263
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,429
Do you think Matt feels that way?

264
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,792
- I don't think I try to pressure him.
- All this is unconscious, Julia.

265
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,873
But, yes, I think you do.
That's why he's so quiet.

266
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,717
<i>He wants to appear in control,
even when he's not.</i>

267
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,675
<i>You make him sound
like he's some sort of ticking time bomb.</i>

268
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,512
<i>It's simple psychology, really.</i>

269
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,116
<i>If you're in an environment
where you feel you can't fail...</i>

270
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,272
<i>sooner or later, you'll explode.</i>

271
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,075
Okay.

272
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,197
I never do two consultations
for rhinoplasty.

273
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,591
Why can't we schedule
and get it over with?

274
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,994
Because that's not the way I work,
Dr. Troy.

275
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,912
Another perfectionist?

276
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,149
I thought you might be looking
for a little more than a consult.

277
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,437
No. I just like to take my time...

278
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,993
and be thorough.

279
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,715
What is the big deal?

280
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,350
You only need to administer a local,
reset the fracture, and stabilize it.

281
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,590
Maybe you'd like to
do this procedure yourself.

282
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,751
Could save an awful lot of money.

283
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,828
I'm sorry.

284
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,631
Rough day at the office.

285
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,036
Don't you find that working hard all day
can build stress?

286
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,870
I know how I like to release that tension.
What do you do?

287
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,911
How's Thursday for you?

288
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,911
That's it? We're done?

289
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,629
Unless there's something else
you'd like to tell me how to do, yes.

290
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,791
Now that you mention it...

291
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,193
I haven't had an all-over
body mole check in a while.

292
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,510
Perhaps you could take a look?

293
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,513
Seeing as you're so thorough.

294
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,314
Would you like a gown?

295
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,836
Actually, Doctor,
on occasion, I sunbathe in the buff.

296
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,868
A scrotal melanoma is a stain
I don't want on this birthday suit.

297
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,750
It looks like you've got
more than your share down here.

298
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,592
Wait another minute.

299
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,555
Jesus! What the hell are you doing?

300
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,350
No moles. But I'd recommend some lipo
for those hips.

301
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,309
Are you saying I have love handles?

302
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,116
I do not have love handles.

303
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,835
Not that it's noticeable to
the untrained eye, but to a professional...

304
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,672
I am a professional, sweetheart.

305
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,354
Don't try and sell me
something I don't need.

306
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,234
You're 40 years old, Dr. Troy.
A few preventative measures now...

307
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,870
could help you hold onto your current look
for another five years.

308
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,713
I'd recommend scheduling lipo
and some Restylane...

309
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,350
to soften those puppet lines around
the mouth during the same appointment.

310
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,432
Men half my age
want to look as good as this, okay?

311
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,353
<i>You're the one
who needs the work done, Doctor.</i>

312
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,035
Lasik.

313
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,950
Hey!

314
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,714
I need the number
of our insurance adjuster.

315
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,518
Did you just have an accident?

316
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,035
There was a car blocking my space
at work.

317
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,555
I backed into it so I could get out.

318
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,354
You ran into another car on purpose?

319
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,278
I think four times qualifies
as "on purpose," yes.

320
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,034
Sean, what is going on?
Why are you so angry?

321
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,113
Because it was my parking space, Julia!
I work 70 goddamn hours a week for it!

322
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,793
<i>You don't block a man in...</i>

323
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,635
when he's working his ass off all day
to provide for his family.

324
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,591
Honey, it's okay.

325
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,436
Could you still love me
if I wasn't a surgeon, Julia?

326
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,274
If we had to move out of this house?

327
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,750
Of course I'd still love you.

328
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,671
I can't operate anymore.

329
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,515
I'm having a problem with my hand.

330
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,999
It shakes every time I pick up a scalpel.

331
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,918
A neurological problem?

332
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,915
I had Marty Fine check me out last week.
It's nothing physical. It's all up here.

333
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,517
You mean, it's all psychological.

334
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,955
What's the difference?
I can't keep my hand steady.

335
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,759
The difference is that
if it's all psychological...

336
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,195
it doesn't have to be permanent.

337
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,039
You put yourself under
so much pressure all the time to be perfect.

338
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,272
I'm surprised something like this
hasn't happened sooner.

339
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,557
There's nothing wrong
with wanting to be perfect.

340
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,275
Only if you're willing to fail.

341
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,591
I knew you'd finally come.

342
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,879
No contact or the visit's over. Got me?

343
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,636
This place is crazy, Matt.

344
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,713
I'm not gonna make it
much longer in here.

345
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,838
What are you doing
telling people about the accident?

346
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,709
I had to. It's the only way
I can get out of this place.

347
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,235
Henry, you are in here for raping Cara.

348
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,639
Admitting you're involved
in a hit-and-run against her...

349
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,711
isn't gonna set you free.

350
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,874
But it'll get me into a hospital.

351
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,198
My lawyer says he can plead
temporary insanity for the rape...

352
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,035
if he can prove I was under
emotional duress at the time...

353
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,789
which I was, because of what we did.

354
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,555
So now you wanna drag me into this
just because you snapped?

355
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,792
Everything was fine.

356
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,032
All you had to do was play cool
and stay away from her...

357
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,714
and none of this would have happened.

358
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,193
You disgust me.

359
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,953
How could you rape a girl
who was so fragile and naive...

360
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,634
- How could you do what you did?
- I didn't do anything.

361
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,075
You pretended what we did was okay!

362
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,757
Doesn't the pressure
get to you sometimes, Matt?

363
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,599
Aren't you at all haunted by what we did?

364
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,953
That's what was so beautiful about Cara.

365
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,716
She was so pure.

366
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,710
She could never do what we did:

367
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,030
leave someone dying in a ditch.

368
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,718
I guess I just thought if I could get
someone like that to love me...

369
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,878
then maybe I wouldn't be
a bad person anymore...

370
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,319
and God could forgive me for what I did.

371
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,631
When she finally said
she'd never go out with me...

372
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,799
I knew I'd lost my chance for absolution.

373
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,754
You take away
someone's chance to be saved, Matt...

374
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,795
you take away their soul.

375
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,479
I know.

376
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,472
You're on your own in this, Henry.

377
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,155
No, don't go. Please.
I'm sorry.

378
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,153
You can't leave me in here.
They're gonna rape me, Matt.

379
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,639
I warned you once, asshole.

380
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,110
Please help me, Matt!
You have to help me!

381
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,718
Tell me how sexy I am.

382
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,680
I wanna hear you say it.
You're sexy.

383
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,632
- You love my body, don't you?
- Yes, I wanna touch you.

384
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,993
No, here. You like my ass, right?

385
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,473
Tell me how much
you like my rock-hard ass.

386
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,029
Say it.

387
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,149
Say it.

388
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,672
What the hell do you think I am
all of sudden?

389
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,389
Right now, I'm imagining you
as a brunette plastic surgeon.

390
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,118
Is that all I am to you? Just a hole to fill?

391
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,679
Get off me.

392
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,119
Get off me, you asshole!
Christ!

393
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,314
<i>When are you gonna
get it through your head, Gina?</i>

394
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,189
Sex between us is just that: sex.
No strings attached.

395
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,352
You wanna connect with somebody?
Pay a shrink.

396
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,597
- I thought I was doing you a favor.
- Screw you, Christian.

397
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,075
I'd gone nine months
without a sexual encounter.

398
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,913
I hadn't even masturbated.
And then you...

399
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,191
You bat your eyes at me,
and you talk so nice to me.

400
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,072
- I thought this time would be different.
- Why would tonight be any different?

401
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,990
You're hideous, you know that?

402
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,790
And now, in a fit of karma...

403
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,190
you're as ugly on the outside
as you are on the inside.

404
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,675
Christian?
In here.

405
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,314
How bad is it?
See for yourself.

406
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,115
Jesus.

407
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,876
You need to clean this up.

408
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,990
What in the hell were you doing?

409
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,559
I managed to make the cut
with the 11-blade...

410
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,598
but when I reached for the osteotome
and set up to break the bridge...

411
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,152
guess what happened?

412
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,676
You realized how completely ridiculous
you were being?

413
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,116
My hand started to shake.

414
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,720
I was staring at myself in the mirror...

415
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,756
and I realized I'm all alone.

416
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,998
My nose was bleeding...

417
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,789
and the only person that I trusted
was myself.

418
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,435
I couldn't handle the pressure.

419
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,199
I choked.

420
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,232
At least you had the sense to stop yourself
before you did more harm.

421
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,157
Now I understand
what you're going through, Sean.

422
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,079
That anxiety.

423
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,989
If I treated every patient
the same way I treated my face...

424
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,752
I couldn't manage.

425
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,118
But that's what you do, every day.

426
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,717
I scheduled myself for surgery
tomorrow at 8:00 a. m.

427
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,353
- You're gonna fix this properly.
- Me? No, I'm not ready for that.

428
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,433
- What about your need for...
- This is about more than just my face.

429
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,797
It's about our future.

430
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,956
Sean?

431
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,029
Sean?

432
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,754
He's prepped and ready for twilight.

433
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,749
Place your fat noggin on the pillow
for me, sleeping beauty.

434
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,193
You look fantastic. Have you lost weight?

435
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,750
If you think one lousy compliment's
gonna stop me from killing you...

436
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,196
after all the shit you've put me through,
think again.

437
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,552
You're gonna be fine.

438
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,233
I know I am.

439
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,710
Count backwards from 10 for me.

440
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,233
Ten...

441
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,589
nine...

442
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,749
eight, seven, six...

443
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,157
Stop the anesthesia, Liz.

444
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,077
I can't do it, Christian.

445
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,670
Call Dr. Jordan. I'm sorry.

446
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,277
Tell you what,
if I think you're not doing a good job...

447
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,795
I'll stop you myself. Fair enough?

448
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,236
What are you talking about?

449
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,553
Let's pack my nose.
Numb it with 10 cc's of lidocaine.

450
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,474
And hold a mirror in front of my face
so I can see what's going on.

451
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,634
I don't want Dr. Jordan, Sean.

452
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,632
I trust you. I'll stay awake the whole time.

453
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,758
We'll do it together.
Are you crazy?

454
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,992
I'm not performing a rhinoplasty
on an unanesthetized patient.

455
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,515
Not alone, you're not. I'll assist.

456
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,431
I tried it alone myself.
Didn't work for me, either.

457
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,473
I think we both work better as a team.

458
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,229
Liz.

459
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,793
15-blade.

460
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,758
I need to reset the septum
before I can properly set it straight.

461
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,229
Even with a local,
you'll feel the bone break.

462
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,039
Let me give you some Versed,
just to relax you.

463
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,316
And miss all the fun? No way.

464
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,355
Chisel.

465
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,836
Liz, you wanna hold his head?

466
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,595
Hammer.

467
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,358
You're doing great.

468
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,469
Don't even think about it.
You've done a thousand nose jobs before.

469
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,154
And you are gonna do
a thousand more.

470
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,480
Breathe. That's good. Breathe.

471
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,478
All right, ladies.

472
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,637
Let's stitch him up
and wheel him off to Recovery.

473
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,634
Thank you.

474
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,268
Thank you.

475
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,759
You wanna go over
what you're gonna say?

476
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,268
Henry's father is already in there.
I talked to his attorney again.

477
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,831
He told me if the story
about the hit-and-run was true...

478
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,513
since no one died...

479
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,035
the whole case could probably
be plea-bargained...

480
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,236
Jesus, Dad, who do care more about:
me or Henry?

481
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,153
That's silly. You're my son, Matt.
Right.

482
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,591
And Henry was the one who raped Cara.

483
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,876
So why are you keen on
having me help him get off?

484
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,430
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Then what is it? You don't trust me.

485
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,989
I'm saying I want you to trust me
when I tell you...

486
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,993
that admitting
you've made a mistake is okay.

487
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,349
Driving into someone and running away
is just a mistake to you?

488
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,349
Yes.

489
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,796
As a matter of fact,
I did the same thing the other day.

490
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,593
I used some bad judgment
during a time of crisis, and I overreacted.

491
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,115
But I took responsibility for it.

492
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,839
Relying on another person's faith...

493
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,195
when you don't have faith
in yourself isn't easy.

494
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,351
But you've gotta trust me.

495
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,111
What I'm trying to say...

496
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,596
is that I love you, Matt.

497
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,031
And if I actually admit it,
that I ran over someone...

498
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,915
and left the scene of the crime...

499
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,077
you'd still feel that way?
You'd still stand by me?

500
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,873
No matter what.

501
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,199
We're ready.

502
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,357
Present today are
Richard Shapiro, Henry's father...

503
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,478
Sean McNamara,
and his son, Matt McNamara.

504
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,917
Matt is here of his own free will...

505
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,198
and has agreed to give a deposition
relating to a purported crime...

506
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,715
that occurred some nine months ago.

507
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,595
Matt, at this time,
I need to remind you...

508
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,830
this is very serious matter.

509
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,635
And we'll be going on record
as part of this investigation.

510
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,597
<i>Do you swear to tell the truth...</i>

511
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,069
the whole truth, and nothing but?

512
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,148
Yes, sir.

513
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,555
Very well, then. First question.

514
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,592
Were you in any way,
as Henry Shapiro has stated...

515
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,072
involved in a hit-and-run accident
against Cara Fitzgerald?

516
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,515
No.

517
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,670
