00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:15,625
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:17,135
This is a business.

3
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:20,434
A very good business that is
on the verge of setting us up for life.

4
00:00:20,506 --> 00:00:22,770
Maybe I don't want to be
in this business anymore.

5
00:00:22,842 --> 00:00:26,539
We didn't give you a circumcision
because you were six weeks premature.

6
00:00:26,612 --> 00:00:28,580
Just give me something that I need.

7
00:00:29,582 --> 00:00:32,813
I'm not one of your patients, Sean!
I'm your wife!

8
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:36,681
And on your watch, a death has occurred,
the death of you and me.

9
00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:42,286
-How's the sensitivity?
-Fine.

10
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:50,628
Your partner didn't go back to your office.
Where did he go?

11
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:58,042
We have to go to the police.

12
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:00,636
No. I am not going down for this.

13
00:01:01,347 --> 00:01:02,609
What do we do?

14
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,044
I think we should hire
a full-time psychologist to screen better.

15
00:01:09,122 --> 00:01:12,922
And I want 20% of our client base
to be pro bono from now on.

16
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:18,427
Dr. McNamara, you wanted to see me?

17
00:01:18,498 --> 00:01:21,023
Dr. Pendleton, please put on your mask.

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,632
Sorry. I haven't been
in too many surgeries.

19
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:26,729
That's exactly the reason
I thought you'd like to observe today.

20
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:29,570
It's vital you know the risks and rewards
of our procedures...

21
00:01:29,642 --> 00:01:31,439
if you're going to counsel our patients.

22
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:33,638
Are we doing
a breast augmentation today?

23
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:35,738
Actually, we're correcting one.

24
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:41,216
Jesus, she looks like Murray Feltman.

25
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:43,983
This patient received C implants
a month ago.

26
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:45,751
Before the gels could set properly...

27
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:48,555
her abusive boyfriend
pushed her against a wall so hard...

28
00:01:48,628 --> 00:01:50,994
that the implant
ruptured through the capsular wall.

29
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:54,430
We're repairing the damage
and the capsular wall pro bono.

30
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,263
Liz, how deep's the patient?

31
00:01:56,335 --> 00:01:59,429
It's Marie, and she's ready when you are.

32
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:02,567
Sorry.

33
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:06,237
Liz was our previous anesthesiologist.

34
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:10,939
We begin by cutting into the nipple.

35
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:17,486
Oh, shit!

36
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:23,025
-Good hire, Sean.
-What's wrong?

37
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:25,222
Other than the new mandate
that all patients...

38
00:02:25,298 --> 00:02:28,825
have to be psychologically screened
and approved by both of us?

39
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:32,266
I have a consult in my office.

40
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:34,505
Step in when you're finished.

41
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,138
Miss Dante, tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

42
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:45,378
It's not that I don't like myself.
I just don't want to look like her anymore.

43
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:48,147
Yeah, and I don't want
to look like her, either.

44
00:02:48,955 --> 00:02:51,253
See, we've made this agreement.

45
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:56,754
-I want to change my face.
-And I want to change my body.

46
00:02:57,163 --> 00:03:02,066
We were thinking it would be so great
if one of us could wear a miniskirt...

47
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:04,830
and not feel self-conscious
about our chicken legs.

48
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:09,807
So l'd like bigger calves,
and l'd also like to go up to a C cup.

49
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:13,974
And I was thinking
that maybe I could have her ears...

50
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:16,139
'cause they don't stick out
like ours do, see?

51
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:17,307
See?

52
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:20,750
And I like her nose.
That is Jennifer Garner.

53
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,414
-She kicks ass!
-She so kicks ass!

54
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:27,356
<i>I tore that picture out of teen Vogue
magazine so you guys could copy it.</i>

55
00:03:29,028 --> 00:03:32,862
Miss Dante, Miss Dante, l'd like you
to come back later in the week...

56
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:36,129
and meet Dr. Pendleton,
our on-site psychologist.

57
00:03:37,103 --> 00:03:40,163
lnterestingly enough, Mandi and Randi
have already given me...

58
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,764
the contact information
of their own psychologist.

59
00:03:42,842 --> 00:03:44,969
Yeah, and she's completely cool
with the fact...

60
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:49,743
that we're sick and tired of going through
our lives being mistaken for each other.

61
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:52,079
Even our own father
can't even tell us apart.

62
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:55,143
They are going
to the University of Miami in the fall...

63
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:57,416
and they believe
that now is the perfect time...

64
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,789
for them to establish
their own singular identities.

65
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:05,893
Not to play devil's advocate,
but have you tried less drastic measures?

66
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:08,399
For instance,
maybe styling your hair differently.

67
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:12,028
Didn't work. I mean,
people still confuse me with Randi.

68
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:15,663
We even went as far as to get tattoos.

69
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:17,902
And they were pretty much worthless.

70
00:04:17,977 --> 00:04:19,945
Why were they worthless?

71
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:26,678
We realized that people could only use
them to tell us apart if we're naked.

72
00:04:34,894 --> 00:04:36,657
God, it's good to be back!

73
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,508
Heads up.

74
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:39,120
-What's this?
-It's a prophylactic, Matt.

75
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,325
Yeah, I know what it is, Dad.
Why did you give it to me?

76
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:46,661
You're worried about your girl's reaction
to your foreskin in the first time, right?

77
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:51,130
You responsibly slip this on
when that time comes...

78
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:52,995
she won't even know.

79
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:56,468
Once you get your sea legs,
you can be confident enough...

80
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:59,841
to initiate a conversation
about what foreskin is...

81
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:02,670
and how it really won't affect her pleasure.

82
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:07,886
-How does it look now?
-Hey, that looks great.

83
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:10,645
Just want to write something on the top.

84
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:15,320
-Good morning.
-Morning.

85
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:21,590
What are you guys drawing over there?

86
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:23,860
It's so we can find Frisky.

87
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,165
Don't worry, honey, he'll show up.

88
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:34,343
Jules, that smell is terrible. We gotta get
a plumber out here to fix the toilet.

89
00:06:35,347 --> 00:06:38,839
It's the entire septic system.
It's completely backed up.

90
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:41,318
Can you get someone out here this week?

91
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:45,514
Sure, Sean. Can you pick up
the dry cleaning today?

92
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:48,821
Sure.

93
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:56,894
Are you getting the jump
on Easter, Jules?

94
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:59,767
I'm starting a new business with Suzanne.

95
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,569
-Crazy Suzanne?
-Creative Suzanne.

96
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,876
What kind of business?

97
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:12,344
They're gift baskets for women,
and they're very popular right now.

98
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:14,648
There's a real market for them.

99
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:26,259
Well, Jules, I think that's great.
You can work out of the home...

100
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:28,232
and be with the kids. That's great.

101
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,860
I can go back to school
and be with the kids, too, Sean.

102
00:07:30,936 --> 00:07:33,905
My priorities aren't changing that greatly.

103
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,735
Christ!

104
00:07:38,577 --> 00:07:42,570
God, this is ridiculous. Why don't
you guys just go to marriage counseling?

105
00:07:42,648 --> 00:07:45,014
Because marital counseling never works.

106
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:47,882
It's just a way for people
to figure out how to break up.

107
00:07:47,953 --> 00:07:50,251
You're helping no one
by doing what you're doing.

108
00:07:50,322 --> 00:07:54,622
Stop dealing in stupid half-measures
and either shit or get off the pot.

109
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:56,524
He said the "brown" word.

110
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:02,494
Yeah, I did. I'm sorry.

111
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:05,097
Sorry.

112
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:17,338
I haven't seen you here in a while,
Christian. You look like an albino.

113
00:08:18,717 --> 00:08:20,480
I had a work-related injury.

114
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:23,579
But now I'm back on my game
and resuming my regular activities.

115
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:26,784
Can I interest you
in our mystique tan today?

116
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:31,224
Just a regular bed for me, sweetheart.
I'm a traditionalist.

117
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:35,660
How about some...

118
00:08:36,802 --> 00:08:39,134
tanning accelerator lotion, then?

119
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:41,731
Well, Janelle...

120
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:44,699
that all depends.

121
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:48,772
Does it come with an application?

122
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:11,965
Don't worry. I'll turn you over
when the timer goes off.

123
00:09:21,814 --> 00:09:25,614
-Too early in the morning for you, baby?
-Help me out a little.

124
00:09:35,828 --> 00:09:38,388
<i>Christian, can you help me out here?</i>

125
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:41,558
<i>I'm getting lockjaw.</i>

126
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:55,836
Dr. Santiago, how long
have you been treating the Dante sisters?

127
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:59,351
Three years, at the Miami free clinic.
I'm the director there.

128
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:03,980
I think physical change is a last resort,
but in their case, it's a necessary one.

129
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,418
How so?

130
00:10:06,492 --> 00:10:09,552
Last year, they both lost their virginity
to the same person...

131
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:12,153
a 40-year-old fetishist
they met in a twins chat room...

132
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:14,665
who promised to love them both equally,
and he did.

133
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:16,997
They felt like shit about it,
and they decided...

134
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:19,629
that they wanted to be different
and not interchangeable.

135
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:22,105
Half-measures have ceased to work.

136
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:24,734
So you don't believe in half-measures?

137
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,176
I believe in committing fully to change.

138
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:29,942
It's the commitment
that brings constructive results.

139
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,815
lf Mandi and Randi can look
in the mirror and see singular reflection...

140
00:10:33,886 --> 00:10:37,947
only then are they going to be able to
view themselves as whole and not halves.

141
00:10:40,426 --> 00:10:42,656
I'm still debating. Go ahead.

142
00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:47,532
-I'll have the sea bass and a Pellegrino.
-All right.

143
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:51,660
And I'll have a hamburger, fries,
and a margarita.

144
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:52,999
You got it.

145
00:10:55,874 --> 00:10:58,604
You know what?
I'll have what she's having.

146
00:10:58,677 --> 00:11:01,202
-Sure.
-I don't have any surgeries this afternoon.

147
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,148
-One margarita will be fine. You?
-I need to drink.

148
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:08,742
I have an ADD patient right after this
who spends half the session...

149
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:12,222
lining up the Kleenex box just so,
and the remaining 20 minutes...

150
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:16,193
recounting how he obsessively thinks
about me while he's masturbating.

151
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:18,991
You must get that a lot.

152
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,458
Attention Deficit Disorder patients.

153
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:41,245
I want to try it.

154
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:44,080
Okay.

155
00:11:44,723 --> 00:11:46,315
Where are you going?

156
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,325
I was gonna get a condom.

157
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:53,294
I want to see it first.

158
00:11:57,069 --> 00:11:59,230
Okay. Yeah, sure.

159
00:12:30,636 --> 00:12:32,399
lt looks like a Shar-Pei.

160
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:35,897
Are you part Arab or something?

161
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:41,772
No.

162
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:55,125
Does it turn you off that I'm not...

163
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:57,726
circumcised?

164
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:01,123
No, not at all.

165
00:13:09,174 --> 00:13:11,665
Maybe we should just make out today.

166
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:30,317
This isn't your father's coffeepot. lt
actually grinds the beans in the machine.

167
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:33,193
It's amazing what you can afford
when you nix a steam room...

168
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:35,597
and put that money
towards something more practical.

169
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:38,397
That cost more than my car.
What a perk it would've been...

170
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,270
to hang out in here and have
a double macchiato in between tit jobs.

171
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:45,004
A macchiato, you say?

172
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:47,940
Sean, why did you ask me here today?

173
00:13:49,882 --> 00:13:53,841
To make you an offer. lf you come back,
I'll double your salary.

174
00:13:55,454 --> 00:13:58,014
That sounds like hush money, Sean.

175
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:02,819
You're an invaluable part of the team.

176
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:05,455
You're the best anesthesiologist
l've ever worked with.

177
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:07,260
And as an additional bonus...

178
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:09,960
I'll throw in something
you've always wanted:

179
00:14:10,035 --> 00:14:12,970
Complete health benefits
for your partner, Jean.

180
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:14,062
Jan.

181
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,603
I can't work this goddamn thing.

182
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:18,136
I'll do it.

183
00:14:27,953 --> 00:14:29,648
Jan and I broke up.

184
00:14:30,155 --> 00:14:32,123
-I'm sorry.
-I'm not.

185
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:36,318
For 15 years, I put up with
her pot smoking and her cynicism...

186
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:38,795
and finally, two weeks ago...

187
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:42,493
I just said, "Honey, I love you,
but I am not in love with you."

188
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:44,058
What got into you?

189
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:48,431
Someone pushed a gun into my temple.

190
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:52,043
You might remember
that moment, Sean. You were there.

191
00:14:54,613 --> 00:14:56,080
l've never really...

192
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:59,015
apologized for putting you
in that situation, Liz.

193
00:14:59,084 --> 00:15:00,517
No, you didn't.

194
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:04,149
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:09,156
It's all right, Sean.

196
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:12,727
Actually, it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

197
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:20,262
A shift has happened in me. I can feel it.

198
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:26,043
I broke up with Jan
because I want to be in love deeply.

199
00:15:26,778 --> 00:15:31,078
I sold my condo. I'm moving to the beach
'cause that's always what l've wanted...

200
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:33,947
and I figured, "What are you waiting for?"

201
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,450
What happened that night
got me thinking.

202
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:41,756
What if I can't put off stuff
until tomorrow...

203
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:44,193
because I don't get another tomorrow?

204
00:15:47,332 --> 00:15:48,993
I felt similarly.

205
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:52,234
What happened
really changed my outlook.

206
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:55,762
Yeah.

207
00:15:56,675 --> 00:16:00,907
Well, there's a big difference
between changing your outlook...

208
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:03,510
and changing your life, Sean.

209
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:14,282
Where are you gonna stay?

210
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:17,089
A hotel for tonight,
and then I don't know.

211
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:19,894
This is so typical of you, Sean.

212
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:23,025
You don't even show me
the respect you show a patient.

213
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:27,197
At least with a patient, you tell them
what the diagnosis is before you operate.

214
00:16:27,272 --> 00:16:29,866
Let's just cut the shit, Julia,
starting right now.

215
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:32,933
You want out of this marriage.
lf you didn't, you'd fight for us.

216
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:34,842
But instead, all you do is fight with me.

217
00:16:34,913 --> 00:16:37,939
Fighting denotes communication,
which you don't do!

218
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:42,919
We've talked in circles. I'm dizzy from it.
I have no perspective anymore.

219
00:16:42,988 --> 00:16:44,979
You're a goddamn hypocrite.

220
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:47,116
And I am miserable with you!

221
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:51,392
And you are miserable with me,
and the big difference is, let's just say it...

222
00:16:51,463 --> 00:16:53,829
you're content in your misery, Julia.

223
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:58,263
l'd rather separate and try and figure out
a way to make us connect again.

224
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,395
We have to change this,
or we die on the vine.

225
00:17:01,473 --> 00:17:04,567
And if you're too paralyzed
to take any action, I will.

226
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:16,816
What about the kids?

227
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:22,354
I'm not abdicating my role as a father.

228
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:26,261
-Of course I'll see them.
-For one hour a week, like you do now?

229
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:35,533
Don't I get a say in any of this?

230
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,041
You do get a say.

231
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,173
Say you're still in love with me,
and I'll stay.

232
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:07,538
Have you ever done twins?

233
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:10,439
Mother and daughter once,
but never twins.

234
00:18:15,514 --> 00:18:17,243
I left last night.

235
00:18:18,817 --> 00:18:20,284
I left my family.

236
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,146
I swore I wouldn't turn into my asshole
of a father, and God help me.

237
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:31,724
How did Julia take it?

238
00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:35,427
She's hurt, angry, afraid.

239
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:40,267
You gonna get a divorce,
or is this just another separation?

240
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:43,840
I just want to feel something again.

241
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:53,312
Hey, celebrate, you dumb mick.
You're a single doctor now.

242
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:55,478
Translation: ass galore.

243
00:18:55,554 --> 00:18:58,455
I can't just turn into you, Christian.
I'm not that guy.

244
00:18:58,523 --> 00:19:00,047
Now's your chance.

245
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:14,102
Welcome back.

246
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:17,403
At double the salary,
how could a lady refuse?

247
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,643
I'll do facial, you do bodywork?

248
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:39,260
10 Blade.

249
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,894
Scalpel.

250
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:08,325
ls it fixed?

251
00:20:09,094 --> 00:20:12,962
No, it's a wicked, big clog.
I had to run out and get a bigger snake.

252
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:17,998
Don't be embarrassed, Julia.

253
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:21,061
Joe used to clog up the toilet, too,
and leave it for me to fix.

254
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:25,166
It's not until they leave
that you realize how much you've settled.

255
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:32,276
I'm sorry, Suzanne.

256
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:35,986
Why are we putting these eye masks
in our baskets?

257
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:40,750
You get a hot flash.
You pop it out of the fridge...

258
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:44,659
and onto your eyes.
Menopausal women will love them.

259
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,830
-Mrs. McNamara.
-Yeah?

260
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:50,761
I fixed your clog...

261
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,433
and I found this.

262
00:20:56,174 --> 00:20:59,666
What's she gonna do with a turd,
bronze it? Jesus!

263
00:20:59,911 --> 00:21:02,436
It's a gerbil. My daughter has one.

264
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:06,142
Annie lost her gerbil, right?
I saw the sign outside.

265
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:12,847
Poor Frisky!
lt must've climbed up and fallen in.

266
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,187
No, that's impossible.
Gerbils can't climb porcelain.

267
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:20,754
There's no traction for their claws.
Somebody threw this in.

268
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:23,400
I saw a boy's bike outside the house.

269
00:21:23,468 --> 00:21:26,801
You have a teenage son,
isn't that right, Mrs. McNamara?

270
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:30,973
I don't want to freak you out about this...

271
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:34,074
but they say Ted Bundy
started out this way.

272
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:36,913
Torturing small animals.

273
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,279
Oh, my God. Matt.

274
00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:45,752
My son didn't do it.

275
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:48,986
I did.

276
00:21:53,531 --> 00:21:57,592
You accidentally ran it over when
you were vacuuming or something, right?

277
00:21:58,103 --> 00:22:00,594
And you didn't want Annie to know.

278
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:03,871
See, that explains it.

279
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:06,539
lt wasn't an accident.

280
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:11,376
There'll be no charge.
I don't want your money.

281
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,475
What kind of mother are you?

282
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:40,372
Why won't you give me the circumcision?
He doesn't even have to know.

283
00:22:40,445 --> 00:22:42,743
Carving up your dick
is a little more telltale...

284
00:22:42,814 --> 00:22:45,339
than buying you a six-pack on the sly.

285
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,749
Hi, I'll have a Dewar's straight up.

286
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:56,986
He'll have a Coke. I'll have
the Dewar's, sweetheart. Thank you.

287
00:22:58,396 --> 00:23:02,457
Besides, I'm of the opinion that
your father's right about this one.

288
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:03,831
You don't need a circumcision.

289
00:23:03,902 --> 00:23:06,427
lf you guys won't help me,
I'll go to another surgeon.

290
00:23:06,504 --> 00:23:10,270
Who will operate without a signed
parental consent form. Good luck.

291
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,945
The problem isn't your dick, Matty.
It's your confidence.

292
00:23:15,013 --> 00:23:19,040
You were timid and embarrassed.
She saw that and it turned her off.

293
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:21,144
Thanks.

294
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:22,584
Why are we here?

295
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:26,284
Because we are gonna
work on the confidence part.

296
00:23:30,695 --> 00:23:33,823
<i>-You're kidding me, right?
-Au contraire, my little Virginator.</i>

297
00:23:33,898 --> 00:23:36,264
l've arranged for you
to just get it out of the way.

298
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:38,234
A bang under your belt, and I believe...

299
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:40,669
you'll be able
to bicycle over to Vanessa's place...

300
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:44,971
grab that peachy ass,
and show her how it's done with no fear.

301
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:51,509
Girls don't care
if you have a two-inch pecker...

302
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,983
a hairy ass, or balls like cranberries.

303
00:23:54,052 --> 00:23:57,579
What they care about
is that you know what you're doing.

304
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:04,126
-So, which girl?
-Behind me, on the stairs.

305
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:09,661
Her name's Avanti.

306
00:24:10,668 --> 00:24:13,535
Rumor has it
she can suck the peel off an apple.

307
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:17,405
I feel entirely creepy about
paying someone to pretend they like me.

308
00:24:18,743 --> 00:24:22,008
No. Hey, besides, man,
I'm not gonna cheat on Vanessa.

309
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,445
I love her.

310
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:26,378
Haven't you ever had that?

311
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:34,183
Once.

312
00:24:35,193 --> 00:24:36,626
<i>Hey, papi.</i>

313
00:24:36,694 --> 00:24:38,218
-Hey.
-Hey.

314
00:24:42,901 --> 00:24:44,630
Yeah, thank you...

315
00:24:45,103 --> 00:24:47,071
but, no.

316
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:49,562
No, thank you.

317
00:24:52,477 --> 00:24:53,705
Fair enough.

318
00:24:58,016 --> 00:25:02,646
lf you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go upstairs
and pay someone to pretend they like me.

319
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,304
What's wrong, baby? You like boys?

320
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:01,209
<i>I think you like boys.</i>

321
00:26:03,815 --> 00:26:05,578
I think you like boys.

322
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:09,852
<i>Come on, baby,
why can't you get caliente?</i>

323
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:12,583
Because you've got a carved face,
and in my estimation...

324
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:15,023
that's the worst tit job l've ever seen.

325
00:26:20,365 --> 00:26:22,026
Here's my business card.

326
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,866
You want to look like a woman
instead of a carnival freak, call me.

327
00:26:28,907 --> 00:26:32,206
Mr. Brancato, l've invited
our psychologist, Dr. Pendleton...

328
00:26:32,277 --> 00:26:34,507
to sit in on our consultation.

329
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,410
Mr. Brancato, tell me what
you don't like about yourself.

330
00:26:41,286 --> 00:26:42,810
It's my dick.

331
00:26:43,488 --> 00:26:44,978
I hate my dick.

332
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,083
You feel it's inadequate?

333
00:26:58,403 --> 00:27:00,428
Would you like to show us?

334
00:27:13,718 --> 00:27:16,050
lt looked like one of those
summer blood sausages...

335
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,351
you get in the Hickory Farms
Christmas gift sampler baskets.

336
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:22,257
How many enlargement surgeries
has this guy been through?

337
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:26,354
Five. He wants us to harvest fat
from his glutes and inject it into his shaft.

338
00:27:26,431 --> 00:27:28,331
lf he can't go longer, he'll go wider.

339
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,766
Dr. McNamara, I take issue
with your condescending tone.

340
00:27:31,836 --> 00:27:34,031
Mr. Brancato's not to be pitied.

341
00:27:34,105 --> 00:27:36,471
Are you saying you're for
giving him the operation?

342
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:39,476
-That wouldn't be my recommendation.
-Why, Sean?

343
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:43,008
Because you find it personally disturbing?

344
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:46,050
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but didn't you hire Dr. Pendleton...

345
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:48,984
to make recommendations
based on psychological profiling?

346
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:50,782
That's what he's doing.

347
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:53,519
Dr. Pendleton, as you were saying....

348
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:56,856
With every operation,
as his penis becomes larger...

349
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:59,624
Mr. Brancato takes a personal risk.

350
00:27:59,797 --> 00:28:01,628
lf he needs a self-esteem boost...

351
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:05,999
to actually make a positive change
in his life, I say we give it to him.

352
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:14,300
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go for a jog...

353
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:17,007
and let my miso dressing set for an hour.

354
00:28:17,949 --> 00:28:21,009
Dr. Pendleton, l'd like to join you,
if you don't mind.

355
00:28:22,587 --> 00:28:24,782
That would be nice. Thank you.

356
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:27,822
I'll catch up.

357
00:28:31,562 --> 00:28:33,723
lf you have issue
with something I do or say...

358
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:36,460
take it up with me privately.
Not in front of our staff.

359
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:39,367
Absolutely. And likewise,
l'd appreciate it...

360
00:28:39,437 --> 00:28:43,737
if you could send me a memo
notifying me of staff salary increases.

361
00:28:46,511 --> 00:28:50,607
lf calling Mr. Brancato and scheduling
surgery is too distasteful for you...

362
00:28:50,681 --> 00:28:51,807
I'm happy to do it.

363
00:28:51,883 --> 00:28:55,842
You agreed we needed to rethink our
ethical philosophy here. I'm doing that.

364
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:58,921
I'm fine with hiring a shrink
and doing pro bono...

365
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,925
as long as we take on other cases
to finance your sainthood.

366
00:29:01,993 --> 00:29:05,690
I'm playing your game. Once in a while,
throw me the goddamn ball.

367
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,507
Really? So, you're telling me...

368
00:29:19,577 --> 00:29:23,172
you couldn't even get it up
for some hot geisha gash like that?

369
00:29:24,282 --> 00:29:26,375
My urologist says it's psychological.

370
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:29,852
I'm sorry. I feel like we're
crossing the professional line here.

371
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:31,548
You're my employer.

372
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:35,114
That's right. I pay your salary.
So give me my money's worth.

373
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:44,394
I think I know why this is happening.

374
00:29:45,436 --> 00:29:47,336
I just don't know how to fix it.

375
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:50,670
Recently, a married woman
threw herself at my jock.

376
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:52,674
I passed...

377
00:29:53,845 --> 00:29:58,111
but since then I find myself thinking
about her when I'm with someone else.

378
00:29:59,851 --> 00:30:01,944
She's mentally stalking me.

379
00:30:03,121 --> 00:30:07,251
The problem is further complicated
as she's the wife of one of my friends.

380
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:10,692
<i>Quod me nutrit me destruit.</i>

381
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:13,790
Sorry, I was never an altar boy.

382
00:30:14,265 --> 00:30:17,701
It's Latin for
"that which nourishes me, destroys me."

383
00:30:18,069 --> 00:30:19,832
You have two choices.

384
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:23,670
You can destroy your friendship
and nourish your sexual appetite...

385
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:25,641
by banging the horny housewife.

386
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,769
Or, you can nourish your friendship...

387
00:30:27,845 --> 00:30:30,609
and destroy the sexual fantasy
by rejecting her.

388
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:33,775
And once you choose, once you're firm...

389
00:30:34,685 --> 00:30:37,347
that feeling will be reciprocated
in your Dockers.

390
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:41,482
That'll be $150, and I'm not available
the entire month of August.

391
00:30:58,843 --> 00:31:00,538
Three sugars, right?

392
00:31:02,113 --> 00:31:03,671
I don't drink coffee.

393
00:31:03,748 --> 00:31:07,946
Three sugars in your iced tea.
Now I remember. I'll get some.

394
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:13,852
Does Sean know you're stopping by?

395
00:31:14,025 --> 00:31:15,049
No.

396
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:17,754
Should we call him and tell him?

397
00:31:21,065 --> 00:31:22,259
Thanks.

398
00:31:26,971 --> 00:31:29,565
Look, about the other day...

399
00:31:30,308 --> 00:31:33,277
my exam was unprofessional,
and I apologize.

400
00:31:34,078 --> 00:31:38,447
Don't. You saved me
from an excruciating operation.

401
00:31:38,516 --> 00:31:42,475
I'm the one who should be sorry
for not calling you when you were sick.

402
00:31:43,955 --> 00:31:46,515
-The Bell's palsy thing?
-Right.

403
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:51,318
A few weeks of antivirals later,
I'm back on my game.

404
00:31:51,762 --> 00:31:55,528
And a legion of thong-wearing
cocktail waitresses rejoice.

405
00:31:58,169 --> 00:31:59,397
Sorry.

406
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:03,339
Hey, it's okay.

407
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:09,202
-You were married almost 16 years.
-No. I'm not crying about him.

408
00:32:10,114 --> 00:32:11,706
They kicked me out.

409
00:32:12,283 --> 00:32:13,272
Who?

410
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:16,181
The mothers in my kindergarten carpool.

411
00:32:16,254 --> 00:32:19,382
Suzanne told them what had happened,
and then they said...

412
00:32:19,457 --> 00:32:23,291
they felt nervous about trusting
their kids' safety to a murderer.

413
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:27,530
-Back up. Who got killed?
-Frisky.

414
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:30,634
-Frisky, the gerbil?
-Yes!

415
00:32:32,336 --> 00:32:37,103
I don't know. lt just kept shitting,
and I felt overwhelmed, and I flushed him.

416
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,639
I'm a terrible person.

417
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:43,303
You're not a terrible person.

418
00:32:43,748 --> 00:32:47,479
I just think you make bad,
if understandable, choices sometimes.

419
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:49,576
You have a history of that.

420
00:32:53,257 --> 00:32:55,885
Come on. Drink my tea and sit with me.

421
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:07,393
What happened to the girl I knew,
the most confident thing I ever saw?

422
00:33:07,471 --> 00:33:10,929
Who was, and is, by the way,
going back to medical school?

423
00:33:11,008 --> 00:33:14,102
Who used to sing at the top of her lungs
to Fleetwood Mac...

424
00:33:14,178 --> 00:33:16,169
even though she was tone deaf?

425
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:21,382
Who made me forget
there was ever another girl in the room?

426
00:33:26,724 --> 00:33:28,123
I miss us...

427
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:31,420
the way we used to be.

428
00:33:32,229 --> 00:33:34,993
Then let's fix that. Tomorrow.

429
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:36,791
7:00.

430
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:39,162
My place.

431
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:44,132
We'll grill steaks
and get shitfaced on merlot.

432
00:33:46,711 --> 00:33:47,700
Okay.

433
00:33:57,955 --> 00:34:01,220
You're still in there.
I see you even if you don't.

434
00:34:05,396 --> 00:34:06,488
Shit.

435
00:34:07,064 --> 00:34:09,555
I gotta go check on a couple of patients.

436
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:39,591
Are you....

437
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,558
Hard? Yeah.

438
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:45,628
We'll pick this up tomorrow night.

439
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:12,855
Hello!

440
00:35:13,063 --> 00:35:16,658
Hey, Matt. I was wondering
if you were free for lunch tomorrow?

441
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:19,362
<i>I'll pick you up at school.
We can go to Joe Stonecrab's.</i>

442
00:35:19,437 --> 00:35:21,064
You like that place, right?

443
00:35:21,138 --> 00:35:23,504
Tomorrow's no good for me, Dad.

444
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:26,704
Okay, how about Friday?

445
00:35:27,445 --> 00:35:30,812
I need to talk to you about
what's happening to our family, Matt.

446
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:32,872
We don't need to play catch-up. I get it.

447
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:36,181
You and Mom can't stand each other
anymore. You bailed.

448
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:38,852
We'll talk later, okay?

449
00:35:39,356 --> 00:35:40,846
I gotta study.

450
00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:25,499
He didn't notice me.

451
00:36:26,604 --> 00:36:28,265
Who didn't notice you?

452
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:29,863
The male nurse.

453
00:36:30,341 --> 00:36:33,174
When he came in,
he didn't even look at me!

454
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:36,211
She's prettier than me now.

455
00:36:36,847 --> 00:36:38,371
She's prettier!

456
00:36:47,324 --> 00:36:48,985
You misunderstood, sweetheart.

457
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:53,393
I'm Mandi! Don't call me sweetheart
because you can't remember my name!

458
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,400
We just wanna go back
to the way we were.

459
00:37:02,773 --> 00:37:05,435
And we wanna be treated the same.

460
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:08,603
Please help us.

461
00:37:13,183 --> 00:37:14,377
Please.

462
00:37:20,858 --> 00:37:23,554
This is Matt. He's 16, going on 40.

463
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:26,124
And this is Annie. She's seven.

464
00:37:26,196 --> 00:37:27,686
ls your son the mailman's?

465
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:32,600
Yeah, we laugh about that.
My wife, who I'm separated from...

466
00:37:33,037 --> 00:37:35,631
is Black lrish on her father's side.

467
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:38,107
My daughter looks like her, too.

468
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:41,372
Actually, she looks a lot like you.
She's beautiful.

469
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:54,385
This really wasn't necessary.
This place is expensive.

470
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:56,926
You helped me a lot with the Dante twins.

471
00:37:57,394 --> 00:37:59,191
It's the least I could do.

472
00:38:00,798 --> 00:38:02,163
Actually...

473
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:05,263
I hope to do it again.

474
00:38:06,236 --> 00:38:07,726
l'd like that.

475
00:38:24,355 --> 00:38:26,050
What are you doing?

476
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:30,523
Did I read something wrong here?

477
00:38:30,594 --> 00:38:32,789
I thought there was
an attraction thing going on.

478
00:38:32,863 --> 00:38:36,196
lnteresting, because I thought
we were being professionals.

479
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:42,332
Did you think that I kept meeting with you
because I wanted to get laid?

480
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:44,872
I thought you respected me.

481
00:38:45,843 --> 00:38:46,969
I do.

482
00:38:47,044 --> 00:38:50,138
No. Apparently, you don't.

483
00:38:52,282 --> 00:38:56,412
I actually thought these second opinions
could lead to better work.

484
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,154
Most people, they get paid
for their consultations.

485
00:38:59,223 --> 00:39:01,020
Please don't.

486
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,787
lf my share is more than that, bill me.

487
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,734
When are you gonna start dating again?

488
00:39:15,806 --> 00:39:18,934
Dating? I'm not dating. Who's dating?

489
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,141
Corpse isn't even cold.

490
00:39:21,211 --> 00:39:23,406
Believe me, I understand change is hard.

491
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,916
Sometimes you just need
a strong jolt to move forward.

492
00:39:26,984 --> 00:39:28,349
By jolt you mean shock?

493
00:39:28,419 --> 00:39:31,479
Yes. Like finding out
that Julia is dating again.

494
00:39:32,256 --> 00:39:35,817
Maybe that would make it easier
for you to get back on the horse.

495
00:39:37,528 --> 00:39:40,258
-Would you like to know if she is?
-ls she?

496
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:44,460
How would I know? I haven't talked to her.
I'm just musing, theoretically.

497
00:39:45,335 --> 00:39:49,965
No, I don't want to know if she is dating.
I can honestly say that would kill me.

498
00:40:01,652 --> 00:40:04,450
-Dr. McNamara, congratulations!
-For what?

499
00:40:04,521 --> 00:40:07,684
For operating on Joe Brancato
and admitting your mistake.

500
00:40:07,758 --> 00:40:10,750
Taking ownership of personal error
is the first step...

501
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:13,991
toward healthy growth and change.
Good job, buddy.

502
00:40:17,034 --> 00:40:18,626
Dr. Pendleton...

503
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,237
you're fired.

504
00:40:28,712 --> 00:40:30,304
You look spiffy.

505
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:35,746
-Where're you off to tonight?
-I have a business dinner with Suzanne.

506
00:40:36,086 --> 00:40:38,111
I should be back by 10:00.

507
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:42,656
Dinner is in the fridge.
Heat it up for five minutes at 350°.

508
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,986
<i>And, Matt, don't show Annie
The Exorcist again.</i>

509
00:40:46,063 --> 00:40:48,327
She needs to know that evil exists.

510
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,592
Okay.

511
00:40:56,807 --> 00:41:00,208
I know your dad and I separating
really sucks for you.

512
00:41:01,011 --> 00:41:03,206
I'm sorry we didn't do this better.

513
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:14,550
Hey, Mom.
Do you have any cuticle scissors?

514
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:17,921
-Why do you need those?
-Why do you think?

515
00:41:21,298 --> 00:41:22,822
I have a hangnail.

516
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:26,669
Upstairs bathroom.
Third drawer on the right.

517
00:41:38,215 --> 00:41:41,207
l've been waiting for an hour.
Why didn't the guard let me in?

518
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:44,743
l've had stalkers before,
but they were patients, not fellow doctors.

519
00:41:44,822 --> 00:41:48,019
That guy, last night, that wasn't me.

520
00:41:48,325 --> 00:41:50,589
I haven't had a date
since Reagan was in office.

521
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:52,356
-I'm bad at it.
-What do you want?

522
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:55,523
To tell you how sorry I am.
lt won't happen again.

523
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,726
I don't want your apologies.

524
00:41:58,502 --> 00:42:00,197
Then how about a job?

525
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:28,227
-Hi.
-Hi.

526
00:43:00,631 --> 00:43:02,724
I thought we said 7:30.

527
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,598
7:00. We said 7:00.

528
00:43:09,573 --> 00:43:12,565
Did you think it was easy
for me to come here?

529
00:43:12,976 --> 00:43:15,774
What did you think
you were coming over here for?

530
00:43:20,584 --> 00:43:24,111
I'm sorry you had to catch me in the
middle of a Doublemint moment there.

531
00:43:25,889 --> 00:43:29,723
But let's not fool ourselves.
That's who I am. Always will be.

532
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:36,627
You want a regular Friday-night date
and a father for your kids...

533
00:43:37,334 --> 00:43:38,767
stay with Sean.

534
00:43:44,141 --> 00:43:46,701
When did you become so cruel?

535
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:06,657
-What are you doing?
-I'm moving back in.

536
00:44:07,798 --> 00:44:11,097
Might not be able to change me,
but I can change me in this marriage.

537
00:44:11,168 --> 00:44:14,160
I realized I'm not a single guy
who wants a new life.

538
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:18,071
I'm a married man who wants to fix
this family. That's what I'm gonna do.

539
00:44:18,141 --> 00:44:21,804
I don't want a fix. I want you out!

540
00:44:22,379 --> 00:44:26,907
I want you to take your pettiness,
and your control issues...

541
00:44:26,984 --> 00:44:31,444
and your sad, lonely midlife crisis,
and get out of my house!

542
00:44:31,855 --> 00:44:34,346
And notice, I said "my house," Sean.

543
00:44:34,691 --> 00:44:39,128
Because I'm not selling it and splitting
the difference when we get a divorce.

544
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:42,660
This is not California, buddy.
I put you through medical school...

545
00:44:42,733 --> 00:44:44,598
and this is all I have to show for it.

546
00:44:44,668 --> 00:44:47,569
-You want a divorce?
-Yeah! You should be happy, Sean.

547
00:44:47,637 --> 00:44:50,538
You'll be legally free
to screw every hot 20-year-old...

548
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:52,837
that waltzes through your office.

549
00:44:53,243 --> 00:44:57,202
How it must kill you
that Christian gets the pick of the litter.

550
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,044
-Hey, calm down.
-Let go of me!

551
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:04,016
-I don't wanna screw around.
-Yeah? Well, maybe I do.

552
00:45:05,522 --> 00:45:07,956
You always were a lousy lay, Sean.

553
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,023
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

554
00:45:12,095 --> 00:45:14,893
You're either a liar or a very good actress.

555
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:19,402
I know your body. I always have.
I know right where you live and breathe.

556
00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:22,163
Then why haven't I had an orgasm
in two years?

557
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:24,867
Because I didn't wanna work that hard.

558
00:45:53,203 --> 00:45:54,636
Right there.

559
00:45:55,072 --> 00:45:57,563
That's where you like it, isn't it?

560
00:45:58,542 --> 00:46:00,510
<i>Hey. How's it going?</i>

561
00:46:00,777 --> 00:46:04,076
<i>You've logged on
to Joey's Self-Circumcision web page...</i>

562
00:46:04,147 --> 00:46:07,776
<i>a guide for guys like me
who have a foreskin problem...</i>

563
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:11,048
<i>and are too embarrassed
to have their doctor do the duty.</i>

564
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:15,615
<i>First things first, guys. Relax.
A shaking hand means you could slip.</i>

565
00:46:16,526 --> 00:46:18,756
<i>I took a mild muscle relaxant.</i>

566
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:22,365
<i>But other guys I know
have fared well on a glass of red wine.</i>

567
00:46:22,432 --> 00:46:24,730
<i>Be smooth and confident.</i>

568
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:41,578
<i>Your surgical tools have to be sharpened
to razor sharpness.</i>

569
00:46:41,651 --> 00:46:45,985
<i>When you do this, the cuts are
virtually painless and bleed very little.</i>

570
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:49,584
<i>I didn't use ice or anything.
There was no need.</i>

571
00:47:19,856 --> 00:47:23,223
<i>For the first cut,
grip the foreskin and pull it out.</i>

572
00:47:23,727 --> 00:47:27,527
<i>Cut in a circular motion,
removing a thin quarter-inch strip.</i>

573
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,443
Rip youyoup
