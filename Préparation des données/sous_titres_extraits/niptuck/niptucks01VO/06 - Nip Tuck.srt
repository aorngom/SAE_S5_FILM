00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,592
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:06,603
You're not the only one
who's lost a baby, Sean.

3
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:08,729
But I was the only one who wanted one.

4
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:13,442
Miss Babcock, tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

5
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:14,877
Everything.

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,118
Mrs. Freudlich, tell me what
you don't like about yourself.

7
00:00:28,193 --> 00:00:30,957
It's Berger. I'm Bliss Berger.

8
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:33,224
Mrs. Freudlich's at 4:00, Sean.

9
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:34,990
I'm sorry, my mistake.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,397
Miss Berger, tell us what
you don't like about yourself.

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,732
My wings.

12
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:43,938
May we see your wings?

13
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:49,243
I call this the wattle from hell.

14
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:51,908
When it's hot, I just move it
back and forth like this...

15
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:54,713
and in 20 seconds my condo's cooler
than an ice cream truck.

16
00:00:54,786 --> 00:00:56,083
I swear to God.

17
00:00:56,154 --> 00:00:58,748
And that's just my arm.
Do you want to see my back fat?

18
00:00:58,824 --> 00:01:01,850
Your point's been effectively made,
Miss Berger.

19
00:01:01,927 --> 00:01:04,953
-You could put your jacket on if you wish.
-Thank you.

20
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:07,722
You've obviously lost
a great deal of weight.

21
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,563
One hundred and forty-three pounds
and counting.

22
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:14,469
The corrective operation you want
is called a brachioplasty.

23
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:17,838
We can probably do the abdominoplasty
at the same time?

24
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,707
Put it on the books.
If you guys are as good as I've heard...

25
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:24,146
I'll be swinging my tucked tuchus
down the aisle in Vera Wang.

26
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:27,345
Is there a date,
because there will be a healing period.

27
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:29,478
Especially if we're talking sleeveless.

28
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:33,320
No date yet. That's why I'm here.

29
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:37,090
I met my soul mate on jdate.com.

30
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:42,026
This is my lsaac. Is he not to die?

31
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:46,430
Not only is he good-looking and Jewish,
he's a doctor.

32
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:49,298
We've been dating for six months now.

33
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:51,431
Over the phone.

34
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:56,746
-He hasn't seen you yet?
-No, of course he has.

35
00:01:56,815 --> 00:02:00,273
I sent him a picture that's 10 years old.

36
00:02:00,952 --> 00:02:04,581
I could not let him see me
tipping the scales at 260, you know.

37
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:08,092
He'd reject me.
He is very into physical fitness.

38
00:02:08,393 --> 00:02:10,122
lsaac does Pilates.

39
00:02:12,464 --> 00:02:15,900
-And now he's pushing for a meeting?
-Has been for three months now.

40
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:18,936
So I got motivated
and lost the junk in the trunk.

41
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:20,767
But now I have a deadline.

42
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:24,636
We're finally meeting in three weeks,
and I have got to look hot.

43
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:28,010
So, Miss Berger, you've been living a lie.

44
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:33,747
Okay, yeah, I have been...

45
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,112
and I'm ashamed about that.

46
00:02:36,588 --> 00:02:40,547
lt was not right to lie, but I am working
very hard to make it the truth.

47
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:43,517
Then let's make an honest woman
out of you.

48
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:45,254
Okay.

49
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:49,758
You and Julia been sucking back
a little chardonnay?

50
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:53,133
-You've been at half-mast all day today.
-I'm just tired, that's all.

51
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:56,105
That girl got me thinking
about a slogan for an ad campaign:

52
00:02:56,174 --> 00:02:59,405
"Be yourself. You know
you could look better." Good, huh?

53
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:02,002
I told you I don't wanna advertise.
It's sleazy.

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,810
lt may've been sleazy two months ago.
Now it's a necessity.

55
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:08,785
Bobolit's doubled his billboard campaign,
and he's launching cable TV advertising.

56
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:10,616
If we don't compete, we're screwed.

57
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:12,213
Speaking of which....

58
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:16,043
-What time is it?
-Oh, no.

59
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,715
It's only 7:00, Dad. You're not late.

60
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,150
Why did you sleep down here?

61
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:25,253
You and Mom fighting again?

62
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,891
Your mother and I are fine, Matt.
I just couldn't sleep.

63
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:34,967
You okay?

64
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:46,512
I wanted a brother.

65
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,111
What?

66
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:52,990
The baby that Mom lost.

67
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,889
I was hoping it was a brother.

68
00:04:59,397 --> 00:05:01,558
That's why you're sad, too, right?

69
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,464
You can't stop thinking about it, either.

70
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,595
I'm concerned how your mother feels.

71
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:11,533
A miscarriage takes a toll on a woman
physically and emotionally.

72
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,673
But how do you feel?

73
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:18,682
-lt didn't happen to me.
-Yes, it did, Dad.

74
00:05:21,152 --> 00:05:23,052
lt was your baby, too.

75
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:27,116
Did you ever give it a name?

76
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,889
First of all, you never name a baby
until it's born. It's bad luck.

77
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:35,158
It's different for your mom.

78
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,665
She's got the hormones,
and the baby's in her body.

79
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:45,308
Mom is doing fine, Dad.

80
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:52,044
You're the one that's missing in action.

81
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:54,245
You're...

82
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,050
depressed.

83
00:06:07,198 --> 00:06:09,496
How did you get so sweet, Matt?

84
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:12,600
Not from your old man.

85
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:21,212
I'll put on some coffee.

86
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:31,717
-David.
-What?

87
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:39,996
If it was a boy,
I wanted to name him David.

88
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:44,434
My sons Matt and David.

89
00:06:56,714 --> 00:06:57,908
Daddy.

90
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:01,576
Dad.

91
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:14,020
Nanette Babcock killed herself? When?

92
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:17,501
Her landlord said
she shot herself three weeks ago.

93
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:21,301
I can't believe this.

94
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,738
Any other ideas
who might be trashing your vehicles?

95
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:26,801
No.

96
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:29,145
ln my experience...

97
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:31,375
and I've had hundreds of cases
such as these...

98
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:33,940
it's usually someone close to home.

99
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:42,224
You did it.

100
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:45,419
So sue me.
I ate your Yoplait yesterday. I confess.

101
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,091
-You trashed my car. Both of them.
-Excuse me?

102
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:50,657
It's suddenly crystal clear.

103
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:54,136
The incidents began when
you started working at Troy /McNamara.

104
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:56,807
McNamara/Troy, but I digress.

105
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,134
I didn't trash your cars, Christian.

106
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,010
You're gonna have to file a restraining
order against Nanette Babcock.

107
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:07,407
She's dead. She killed herself...

108
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,353
which makes you the prime suspect.

109
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:18,991
-What would my motive be?
-You want the power. I've got it.

110
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:21,429
You've enjoyed pushing my buttons
since you started.

111
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:25,060
I may have pushed your buttons,
but you didn't push mine.

112
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,762
Translation: I didn't even have an orgasm
when I slept with you.

113
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,104
Your narcissism was so sickening...

114
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:34,440
that I had to get the hell out
of your apartment, fulfilled or not.

115
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:36,480
The person who's trashing your car...

116
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:39,914
is clearly suffering
from a jealousy-induced manic rage.

117
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:42,748
I'm not jealous of your other women.

118
00:08:42,987 --> 00:08:46,946
I slept with you knowing full well
that you were just a lost, little boy.

119
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:51,457
Shit. You didn't do it.

120
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:55,021
Then who the hell did?

121
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:58,899
The list is so long it could take months
to question all the suspects.

122
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:04,203
-You didn't have an orgasm, is that right?
-Not a shudder.

123
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:06,432
You're a liar.

124
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:10,846
I rode you like a Triple Crown jockey...

125
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,251
and you came.

126
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:16,617
Get out of my face right now.

127
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:20,089
I counted each contraction. Three times.

128
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:24,355
Or were you doing your Kegel exercises?

129
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:29,522
Lock the door.

130
00:09:46,584 --> 00:09:49,052
Anyone ever tell you
you look fine in that skirt?

131
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,314
Don't.

132
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,114
Expressing yourself in private is fine.

133
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:54,954
Doing it in public is not, okay?

134
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:57,756
I told you I don't want anyone
to know about us. I mean it.

135
00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:00,297
It's cool, Rid. Nobody's watching.

136
00:10:00,998 --> 00:10:04,126
Why do you have to be
so goddamn clingy? You're pathetic.

137
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:08,128
-Wait, don't go.
-Get your hands off me, dyke.

138
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:24,649
-Everything all right?
-Oh, my God! Lurk much?

139
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:27,418
I wasn't lurking.
I just asked if you were okay.

140
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:28,516
I'm fine, Matt.

141
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:31,494
My girlfriend misses the trouser snake,
and I'm fine.

142
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:34,690
Yeah, well, get a dildo, Vanessa.

143
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,559
-She's allergic to latex.
-It's not my problem.

144
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,671
-But you could be the solution.
-What?

145
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:50,846
You care about me, don't you?

146
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:54,709
You understand my feelings
for Ridley, right?

147
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:58,750
-Because those are your feelings for me.
-So?

148
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,890
So help me. You're the only one I trust.

149
00:11:05,963 --> 00:11:09,797
Help me make her satisfied
so I can keep her.

150
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,567
And I'll satisfy you.

151
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:21,070
What, you're proposing a three-way?

152
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,838
Yes.

153
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:28,216
Hey, honey.

154
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:32,215
You must be hungry.
You want me to fix something?

155
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,516
I can warm up the pasta
I made for the kids.

156
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:38,460
Nanette Babcock. Remember her?

157
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:42,566
The manic-depressive?
The one you helped?

158
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:46,493
I didn't help her enough, Julia.

159
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:50,766
She shot herself. She's dead.

160
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:57,747
I could have done more.

161
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:02,318
I could have saved her.

162
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:15,695
You're a doctor, Sean, not God.

163
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,429
I can't, Julia.

164
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,086
Are you hard?

165
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:42,218
Is your thing in?

166
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:45,161
I threw it away when it failed us.

167
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:49,060
I just had my period. I should be fine.

168
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:56,863
I can't risk fine, Julia.

169
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:06,112
I can't go through another accident.
I can't stand another loss.

170
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:09,780
We have to do something.

171
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,615
Maybe I should get a vasectomy.

172
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:19,290
Then we wouldn't have to worry anymore.

173
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:21,698
That's an awfully big leap...

174
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,032
between something and vasectomy.

175
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,668
Be honest, Julia.

176
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:35,202
Do you want another child?

177
00:13:36,013 --> 00:13:38,038
Can you see us having one?

178
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,179
No.

179
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:54,496
Maybe I should get my tubes tied.

180
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,024
That's absurd.

181
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:02,798
It's a much simpler operation for me.

182
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:13,609
Did you have any names picked out?

183
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:18,421
No. Did you?

184
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:22,049
No.

185
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:36,233
She wants a three-way?

186
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,433
Yeah, her girlfriend misses guys.

187
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:40,306
So now you want some advice.

188
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:44,112
Suddenly the yearning for Uncle Christian
makes perfect sense.

189
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,611
I've missed you. I really have.

190
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:53,852
You tell your mother
we were taking the boat out?

191
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:55,915
Of course not. She would have hit the roof.

192
00:14:55,993 --> 00:14:59,326
She had every right to. I shouldn't
have taken you to that porn party.

193
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:01,763
If you and I are gonna hang,
we'll follow new rules.

194
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:03,891
No more illicit conversations...

195
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:07,597
no more advice on things
you're not experienced enough to handle.

196
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:11,140
What are we gonna talk about then?

197
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:14,477
You're right. God, it's gonna be boring.

198
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:19,473
Look, Uncle Chris,
do you think I'm mature for my age?

199
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:21,283
God help me, yes.

200
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:24,715
Then stop freaking out
that you're corrupting me.

201
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:28,556
Is having a three-way
taking it to the edge? Yeah, it is.

202
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,560
lt sounds weird...

203
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:35,659
but maybe it's a really modern way
for Vanessa and I to be together.

204
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:39,768
So I'm gonna do it. With or without you.

205
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:45,634
Okay. Rule number 1 .

206
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,201
Should I write this down?

207
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,804
No, just listen.

208
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:53,315
Rule number 1 : It's all about the ladies.

209
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:57,047
Forget who you like and what you like
because you're there to please them.

210
00:15:57,121 --> 00:16:00,386
Start chugging your B vitamins
'cause it's exhausting shit.

211
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:01,883
Okay.

212
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:06,288
-What's rule number 2?
-It's all about the ladies.

213
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:17,305
I'm telling you, Sean, I felt violated.

214
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:21,444
The only other time I felt remotely
this powerless was back in the early '90s...

215
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:24,913
when some chick slipped her finger
up my butt with no warning.

216
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:28,641
Earth to Sean.

217
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:32,213
-Did you hear a word I said? I'm upset!
-And I'm depressed.

218
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:34,257
So take a hit of V. It'll perk you right up.

219
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:37,123
I don't need remedies. I need a solution.

220
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:39,730
So I'm gonna get a vasectomy.

221
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:41,257
What? Why?

222
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:45,393
Julia doesn't wanna have any more kids,
and I can't handle another mistake.

223
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:50,532
That is the most bullshit cure
for depression I've ever heard of.

224
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:53,304
You wanna shoot blanks, Sean,
don't get snipped.

225
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:55,777
-Do what I do. Take a bath.
-What?

226
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,049
Before every date
I sit in a 1 16-degree bath.

227
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:02,814
Excessive testicular heat
shuts down spermatogenesis.

228
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,888
Tea bag your testicles in a hot tub...

229
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:08,584
and I swear to God,
you will be sterile and squeaky clean.

230
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:12,054
You don't know about real loss,
so don't offer me advice.

231
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:13,892
If your marriage is this shaky...

232
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:17,229
that this is the only solution
to your problems, good luck.

233
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:24,473
<i>And screw you. I do understand loss.
The Boatox is my baby.</i>

234
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:28,640
What am I gonna do to make this stop?

235
00:17:28,712 --> 00:17:31,180
I filed a complaint. The cops are useless.

236
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:35,542
I think somebody's gotta go through
his little black book and make amends.

237
00:18:24,401 --> 00:18:26,869
When was your last radiation,
Mrs. O'Hara?

238
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:28,569
Nine months ago.

239
00:18:29,006 --> 00:18:33,272
We were very lucky she didn't
lose her hair. Not a single strand.

240
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:35,005
Most women who have a mastectomy...

241
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:38,105
choose to have breast reconstruction
done during their surgery.

242
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:39,240
I see you didn't.

243
00:18:39,316 --> 00:18:42,183
She was very sick from the chemo,
so she didn't--

244
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:44,619
Jim, you wanna let me
answer this question?

245
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:47,213
These are my tits he's talking about here.

246
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:50,185
Okay.

247
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,062
The chemo did make me very sick.

248
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,194
I wanted to concentrate on healing.
I'm a very holistic person.

249
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:02,234
That's my business, actually.
I'm a chiropractor.

250
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:05,433
When a girlfriend of mine got implants...

251
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,171
she said she woke up after the operation...

252
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:11,476
feeling like a ton of bricks
were sitting on her chest.

253
00:19:11,782 --> 00:19:14,376
I felt I could only handle so much,
you know?

254
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:19,755
Usually, the sensation of weight only
happens if the implant is a "C" or larger.

255
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:22,349
That's what we want. "C's."

256
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:27,862
That's my present to him
for going through this hell with me.

257
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:30,023
I was previously an "A" cup.

258
00:19:31,435 --> 00:19:33,460
That's an awfully generous gift.

259
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:38,267
Well, I can't give him
the children we wanted.

260
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:41,607
The chemo and radiation, you know....

261
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:50,553
It's okay. We can adopt. We're doing great.

262
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:52,486
Jim, just stop! Just stop it!

263
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:55,854
For once just stop being a cheerleader
and let me feel it!

264
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,859
If I don't feel it, I can't get past it.
Don't you see that?

265
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:06,594
Have you cried, Mr. O'Hara?

266
00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:09,496
No.

267
00:20:11,508 --> 00:20:13,032
Not even alone?

268
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,475
I was trying to be strong for you. For us.

269
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:21,373
What? Now I'm a goddamn
unfeeling monster, right?

270
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:24,715
Do you know how many men
leave their wives when they....

271
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:28,354
Your anger's understandable.

272
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:31,951
You've lost the health of your wife,
her body.

273
00:20:32,563 --> 00:20:35,225
Even with implants and a reconstruction...

274
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,460
you'll never get back what you lost.

275
00:20:39,703 --> 00:20:42,695
I am angry. My whole life...

276
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:47,910
all of our dreams, they just blew up...

277
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:51,040
the day she came home and told me.

278
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,883
I want my wife back.

279
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,595
Mr. O'Hara, our staff psychologist
Dr. Santiago...

280
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,793
can recommend a counseling source.

281
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:14,398
And, Mrs. O'Hara...

282
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:18,235
I can recommend a date
for a second consultation.

283
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:27,677
Melanie, hi. Christian Troy.

284
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:30,649
I know it's been six months....

285
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:33,121
Two weeks.... A year since we broke up...

286
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,455
but I'm just calling to talk about
how it ended between us.

287
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:40,088
So, Penny.... Jenny...

288
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,259
call me back so we can catch up.

289
00:21:44,468 --> 00:21:47,926
I really would like to be friends,
and I hope you're well.

290
00:21:52,743 --> 00:21:55,405
-Hello?
-Hey, asshole. How's tricks?

291
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:59,305
I'm sure there's been a dozen
since you kicked me to the curb last week.

292
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:03,149
Gina, I'd know that bitter tone anywhere.
How are you, sweetheart?

293
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,587
<i>If you're calling to tell me
you have genital herpes, spare the drama.</i>

294
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:09,319
I've already got them.
I got infected two years ago.

295
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:10,587
You do?

296
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:12,856
No, I'm clean, prick. What do you want?

297
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,660
I've been doing some
real soul-searching lately, and--

298
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:20,169
The 12-step booty call is not gonna
work with me, Christian. Fool me once.

299
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:21,864
That's not why I'm calling.

300
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:26,171
Sexaholics Anonymous meetings are all
over town if that's what you're looking for.

301
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:29,212
Just stay away from 64th and Collins.
That's mine.

302
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:33,542
Boy, you're a really angry girl, Gina.
Maybe angry enough to trash a car?

303
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,775
We got vandalized, did we?

304
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,511
That's called karma, Christian.

305
00:22:38,622 --> 00:22:42,353
<i>You got a shitload of bad stuff coming.
How does that feel, huh?</i>

306
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:44,150
Being violated?

307
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:46,491
<i>Are you afraid?</i>

308
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:48,428
Do it again, I'll have you arrested.

309
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,558
Eat shit and die, asshole.

310
00:22:57,674 --> 00:23:01,075
<i>-Listen, you crazy bitch--
-You sweet talker, you.</i>

311
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:07,108
-Who is this?
-It's Kimber.

312
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:12,786
<i>Kimber Henry. You fixed my tits,
you gave me a nose job months ago.</i>

313
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:14,886
You just called me.

314
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,488
Oh, right.

315
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:18,925
<i>Kimber, how are you?</i>

316
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:21,487
-Great. How are you?
-Couldn't be better.

317
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:26,068
-Look, thanks for returning my message.
-I was thinking of you, too.

318
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,730
-I was gonna give you a call.
-Why?

319
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:32,836
<i>If you wanna find out,
meet me tomorrow at Mascara Studios.</i>

320
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:56,224
Hey, that's her bad side.
Do not shoot her bad side.

321
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:04,905
All right, take 20, everyone!

322
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:12,408
I'm so glad you're here.

323
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,346
lsn't this cool?

324
00:24:14,785 --> 00:24:18,414
<i>I booked my first cover.
OCEANDRlVE magazine.</i>

325
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:21,384
And, in a way, you're responsible.

326
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:26,286
Look at you, sweetheart. You're an eleven.

327
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:33,000
Kimmie, back off.

328
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:36,905
You're getting body makeup
all over this man's suit.

329
00:24:37,074 --> 00:24:40,168
-Nico Scamarel.
-Dr. Christian Troy.

330
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:43,212
Dr. Troy. The man with the golden knife.

331
00:24:43,313 --> 00:24:45,474
I told her, sure, have him drop by.
Why not?

332
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:47,744
We'll talk about a return visit.

333
00:24:48,018 --> 00:24:49,713
Nico's my manager.

334
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:52,178
And my fiancé.

335
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:53,949
Is she something or what?

336
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:56,686
After this, we're going after
the fronts of the big books.

337
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,751
<i>Vogue, Cigar Aficionado.</i>

338
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:02,558
But as I was telling Kimmie yesterday,
first we gotta lift that ass. Look.

339
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:05,898
One professional to another,
it could be higher, right?

340
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:06,958
Honey...

341
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:11,039
the craft service table, it's total carb hell.

342
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:15,735
Could you look into some veggies or
low-fat protein or something?

343
00:25:17,381 --> 00:25:19,849
Think about giving us
a special price, Doctor.

344
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:21,850
She's walking advertising.

345
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:27,682
Nice.

346
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,218
Unlike some people I know.

347
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:34,458
I had that coming.

348
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:38,694
So, I know why I called you.
Why did you call me?

349
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:42,002
Is there a problem with my insurance
or something?

350
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:44,869
No problem. It's just that lately I've been...

351
00:25:45,676 --> 00:25:47,769
doing some real soul-searching...

352
00:25:52,482 --> 00:25:54,609
and I treated you like shit.

353
00:25:55,752 --> 00:25:57,515
You deserved better.

354
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:01,449
You still deserve better.

355
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:03,425
You're right. I do.

356
00:26:05,462 --> 00:26:06,929
Any ideas?

357
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:46,234
Dinner sounds great, Kimber.
Have the doorman let you in. He has a key.

358
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,061
Okay, baby. I'll see you at 8:00.

359
00:26:58,448 --> 00:27:01,315
-I knew it was you!
-Get your goddamn hands off me.

360
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:03,784
-What is this?
-It's a present.

361
00:27:03,854 --> 00:27:06,049
I was just leaving it
under your wipers, asshole.

362
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:11,154
I was feeling guilty about
telling you not to come to the meetings.

363
00:27:11,228 --> 00:27:13,992
-What else is in the purse, Gina?
-I don't know, Christian.

364
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:16,259
Mace, Altoids...

365
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,794
maybe some spray paint.

366
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:22,163
Nice graffiti. Very accurate.

367
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:26,576
I'm getting it fixed tomorrow morning.
I'm sending you the bill.

368
00:27:26,643 --> 00:27:28,201
I'm putting out a restraining order.

369
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:29,973
Oh, really? Wow.

370
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:31,946
That's gonna be a little difficult...

371
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:34,176
seeing as you don't even know
my goddamn name!

372
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:37,846
What is my last name, asshole?
You never even asked me.

373
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:39,855
Not even after you screwed me.

374
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,291
The police are gonna have
a hard time bringing me to heel...

375
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,157
if they don't know my name.

376
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:48,095
Now, don't you wish you'd
gotten to know me better?

377
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:55,026
Trash my goddamn car one more time,
and I will trash you!

378
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:56,262
I'm a plastic surgeon!

379
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:00,400
I know just which bones to break
to make you an ugly, sorry girl!

380
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:02,669
Are we clear?

381
00:28:08,118 --> 00:28:10,143
It's not gonna stop, Christian!

382
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,053
It's not gonna stop
till you change your life!

383
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:18,451
-Okay, candles.
-Check.

384
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:20,790
Condoms?

385
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:23,592
Check.

386
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,892
Lubricant?

387
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:29,901
Is strawberry-flavored okay?
That's all they had.

388
00:28:30,106 --> 00:28:32,199
Ridley's vegan. That's great.

389
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,241
You know, Vanessa,
this isn't just about Ridley.

390
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:44,309
What do you want?

391
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:48,285
I just want her to love me. That's all.

392
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,389
-Is all this effort worth it?
-You tell me, Matt.

393
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:59,135
Is all this pain worth it to you?

394
00:29:01,505 --> 00:29:02,494
Pain?

395
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,108
I'm a guy about to have a three-way.

396
00:29:11,047 --> 00:29:12,275
Look.

397
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:20,550
I know you think maybe this is a way
for us to be together, Matt.

398
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:24,885
But I have to be honest with you.

399
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:27,725
It's not.

400
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:32,861
You can never have me
the way that Ridley can.

401
00:29:34,804 --> 00:29:36,169
I love you...

402
00:29:37,507 --> 00:29:38,735
as a friend.

403
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,137
But that's it.

404
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:46,740
That's fine.

405
00:29:48,451 --> 00:29:50,112
I feel the same way.

406
00:29:52,455 --> 00:29:56,448
I told you, I'm just the guy
who's helping a girl out in trouble.

407
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:03,593
God, Matt.

408
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:06,098
If only you were a girl.

409
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:20,776
This gives you a "B" cup.

410
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:27,848
-Can l....
-Please, pick it up.

411
00:30:29,492 --> 00:30:31,824
Check the weight, the consistency.

412
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:35,088
That's what this consult is for.

413
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:50,738
I think I'll try the "C" cup.
I've always wanted to wear a tube top.

414
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:57,613
Seems like just yesterday we were
shooting raw silicone into women.

415
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,321
My, how far we've come.

416
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:11,831
We don't have to do this today.

417
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:14,633
I'm on your timetable here.

418
00:31:16,172 --> 00:31:17,537
I'm fine.

419
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:21,135
It's nothing you haven't seen before, right?

420
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:26,571
What do they say, one out of
every five women goes through this?

421
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,878
That's right.

422
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,040
You had an excellent surgeon.

423
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:54,238
This is very clean work.

424
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:57,172
I won't need to do any skin grafts.

425
00:31:58,214 --> 00:32:00,705
You're a great candidate for this surgery.

426
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:07,019
-What about nipples?
-We work with a great tattoo artist.

427
00:32:08,425 --> 00:32:11,292
Tattoos? They're just drawn on?

428
00:32:12,262 --> 00:32:14,787
With the correct shadings
and colorations...

429
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:18,095
they look like the real thing.

430
00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:30,479
Don't for one second feel ashamed
about these scars on your chest.

431
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:35,507
You're just wearing on the outside
what the rest of us wear on the inside.

432
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:52,331
I like your style, Dr. McNamara.

433
00:32:53,236 --> 00:32:54,669
You're very brave.

434
00:32:56,906 --> 00:33:00,603
These consultations can be difficult,
I know. You're the brave one.

435
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:05,806
I meant how you talked to my husband
the other day.

436
00:33:06,282 --> 00:33:08,580
How you talked to him about pain.

437
00:33:11,855 --> 00:33:14,551
-Have you had cancer?
-No.

438
00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:18,226
You know a lot about loss.

439
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:25,799
My wife miscarried recently.

440
00:33:28,872 --> 00:33:32,035
I know what it's like to be a man
and not let yourself...

441
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:34,332
feel.

442
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:38,243
I just wanted your husband to know...

443
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:42,149
he has to take action
if he's gonna get through it.

444
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,283
-Did you take action?
-I'm getting a vasectomy.

445
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:02,494
I guess I'll take the "B" cup.

446
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:10,243
Christian Troy's office?

447
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:14,247
I'll find it.

448
00:34:20,156 --> 00:34:24,024
-How are we doing today, Miss Berger?
-lt hurts.

449
00:34:24,294 --> 00:34:26,660
Are you getting enough pain medication?

450
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,690
This is my medication.

451
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,682
Hey, have you seen Christian?

452
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:53,816
-Get the hell out of this office right now!
-Give me just a minute.

453
00:35:02,832 --> 00:35:05,062
I love her, man, and you don't.

454
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:07,733
She is my life.

455
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:14,999
-What the hell happened here?
-He trashed your office with a baseball bat.

456
00:35:15,078 --> 00:35:16,545
So I guess we found your vandal.

457
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:19,810
He's not the one. I found the person
that was doing this to my car.

458
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:22,147
-This is--
-Just another happy coincidence?

459
00:35:22,218 --> 00:35:24,948
-You gonna press charges?
-No.

460
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:29,990
Who the hell was that guy?

461
00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:32,787
He's the fiancé of a former patient.

462
00:35:32,862 --> 00:35:36,161
So why did he come in here?
Did he hate her nose job?

463
00:35:36,766 --> 00:35:39,701
-He hated the fact that I slept with her.
-When?

464
00:35:41,337 --> 00:35:42,326
Last night.

465
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:45,135
This has got to stop.
You don't shit where you eat.

466
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:47,199
-I'm not gonna--
-It's not your business.

467
00:35:47,277 --> 00:35:48,676
Be a goddamned professional.

468
00:35:48,745 --> 00:35:52,306
You don't see me acting that way.
You don't see Grace acting that way.

469
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:53,713
Excuse me.

470
00:35:54,584 --> 00:35:57,212
-If it happens again--
-What are you gonna do, Dad?

471
00:35:57,287 --> 00:35:58,777
Dock my paycheck?

472
00:35:58,888 --> 00:36:01,118
If it happens again,
someone could get hurt.

473
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,751
Would that make it stop?
Would that get your attention?

474
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,278
I can't see you anymore.

475
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,077
I don't understand.

476
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:30,284
Am I moving too fast, cooking for you?

477
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:32,743
No.

478
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:36,850
You can't let that Nico thing
make you upset, honey.

479
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,454
You know how hotheaded Latin men are.

480
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:46,365
I have to put my life back on track.
I can't sleep with patients anymore.

481
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,403
Sean's right. You don't shit where you eat.

482
00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:54,600
-I am not shit.
-I'm the shit, sweetheart.

483
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:58,838
You are sweet and trusting and kind
and I'm the shit.

484
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:01,549
I don't believe this.

485
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:05,652
When my clothes were off,
you said I was your soul mate.

486
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,586
I'm not gonna be your victim this time.

487
00:37:14,864 --> 00:37:16,729
You do the dishes.

488
00:37:27,543 --> 00:37:29,909
You missed out on a good thing.

489
00:37:59,642 --> 00:38:01,542
lsn't this supposed to be fun?

490
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:04,403
I'm having fun.

491
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:08,176
Aren't you, Matt?

492
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:10,310
Yeah, totally.

493
00:38:11,954 --> 00:38:14,821
So, how do we launch this?

494
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:20,092
I guess one of us
has to start the underwear pile.

495
00:38:30,606 --> 00:38:32,801
God, you guys are such pussies.

496
00:38:55,531 --> 00:38:57,556
I told you she was beautiful.

497
00:38:57,767 --> 00:39:01,225
Vanessa, come here, baby.

498
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:08,532
Up.

499
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:23,982
Help me with her bra.

500
00:40:05,668 --> 00:40:07,329
You have to be invited.

501
00:40:12,175 --> 00:40:13,972
This is about us.

502
00:40:31,427 --> 00:40:33,725
Take off your clothes, Matthew.

503
00:40:34,664 --> 00:40:36,256
Everything.

504
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:56,845
-Are you upset with me?
-Of course not.

505
00:40:56,986 --> 00:40:59,147
It's your body, it's your decision.

506
00:40:59,855 --> 00:41:01,152
Did you and your husband--

507
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:03,715
I made the decision
by myself this morning.

508
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:08,359
Right before I told Jim I was leaving him.

509
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:14,327
Many marriages don't survive cancer.
You're not alone.

510
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:19,902
There's a big hole in our marriage now
that can never be repaired.

511
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:21,668
And we both know that.

512
00:41:23,379 --> 00:41:25,904
We just had to finally be...

513
00:41:27,283 --> 00:41:28,307
honest.

514
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:30,450
I'm so sorry.

515
00:41:31,988 --> 00:41:33,250
Yeah...

516
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,418
me, too.

517
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:42,856
But I'm oddly hopeful now, too.

518
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:45,332
Why is that?

519
00:41:45,868 --> 00:41:48,564
Jim doesn't see me as whole anymore.

520
00:41:49,472 --> 00:41:54,307
I thought maybe no one could.
But you did yesterday during my exam.

521
00:41:54,944 --> 00:41:57,003
And I thank God for that moment.

522
00:42:00,116 --> 00:42:02,676
If I may share a lesson recently learned?

523
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:09,323
Don't make the mistake of healing
the internal problem with an external fix.

524
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:18,858
This day's been tough.

525
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:23,505
I'm gonna go get blotto on a Mojito.
A double.

526
00:42:25,274 --> 00:42:28,072
Thank you, Dr. McNamara, for everything.

527
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:37,483
Maybe you'd like to join me?

528
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:39,385
I'm sorry.

529
00:42:39,555 --> 00:42:43,286
We have a policy here
that we don't see patients socially.

530
00:42:46,562 --> 00:42:49,156
But I am allowed to walk you to your car.

531
00:43:44,453 --> 00:43:45,977
What?

532
00:43:47,056 --> 00:43:49,149
Nothing. I just want to kiss you.

533
00:43:50,092 --> 00:43:51,889
I kiss you all the time.

534
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:26,924
You thanked me earlier.

535
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:31,127
Actually, I'm the one
who should thank you.

536
00:44:32,635 --> 00:44:35,433
I'm not normally the one
with the bedside manner.

537
00:44:35,504 --> 00:44:37,802
That's usually my partner.

538
00:44:40,075 --> 00:44:42,009
But when I was treating you...

539
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,944
I felt like a healer again.

540
00:44:46,982 --> 00:44:48,813
lt was very nice, Megan.

541
00:44:48,884 --> 00:44:51,580
You're a very nice man, Dr. McNamara.

542
00:44:52,221 --> 00:44:53,245
Sean.

543
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:56,752
Out of the lab coat, I'm just Sean.

544
00:45:24,053 --> 00:45:26,044
Good-bye, Megan.

545
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:28,413
Good-bye, Sean.

546
00:46:06,562 --> 00:46:07,893
Who died?

547
00:46:07,963 --> 00:46:10,363
It's recently been
brought to my attention...

548
00:46:10,432 --> 00:46:12,627
that crossing
the patient-doctor boundary line...

549
00:46:12,701 --> 00:46:14,692
is not that uncommon after all.

550
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,837
You're the patient
I want to take that chance with.

551
00:46:45,601 --> 00:46:46,693
Bliss?

552
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,437
I'm lsaac.

553
00:46:59,148 --> 00:47:00,274
What?

554
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:29,201
English
