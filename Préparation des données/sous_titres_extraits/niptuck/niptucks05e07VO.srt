<i>Previously on "Nip/Tuck"...</i>

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:04,015
The money's gone.
She gave it to the church.

3
00:00:04,153 --> 00:00:06,117
Here's a few hundred bucks
to tide you over.

4
00:00:06,217 --> 00:00:09,142
You need some money? Let me help
you out. I'll make it out to "cash."

5
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:12,208
I got, uh, $300 worth,
courtesy of my two dads.

6
00:00:13,104 --> 00:00:16,077
Do you want straight sex,
or do you want needles?

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,778
- You are not screwing him for money!
- I want back in the business.

8
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:22,505
You know, just a few choice titles,
nothing too raunchy.

9
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:26,003
You need to kick the meth, hon. It's
very, very bad for my company's image.

10
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:27,930
So is this it? You're moving out?

11
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:30,195
- Is that what you want?
- I want to be with you,

12
00:00:30,307 --> 00:00:34,250
but first you need to realize that
who you are is nothing to be ashamed of.

13
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,990
It takes a strong individual
to be gay in this world, Julia.

14
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:40,555
You're the only one who's even
pretended to be nice to me.

15
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:43,689
Will you stay with me,
just for a little while?

16
00:00:49,638 --> 00:00:50,827
Are you ready for this?

17
00:01:22,288 --> 00:01:23,861
This is so wrong.

18
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:27,840
That was inevitable.

19
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:33,178
It was just a matter of time before
I got that stick out of your ass.

20
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:51,040
Do you have a hair dryer?

21
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,463
- Where are you going?
- Out.

22
00:01:53,762 --> 00:01:55,942
DJ Seventh son is playing
at the Whiskey tonight.

23
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:58,950
Well, wait. I'll come with you.

24
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:02,642
Don't you want me to?

25
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:05,226
Um, we're done here.

26
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,613
This was a "get it out
of our system" screw.

27
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,559
Don't feel bad.

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,009
After-sex clinginess happens all
the time, especially with older guys.

29
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,487
Are you saying
there's no chemistry here?

30
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:19,372
I like having sex with older men.

31
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,726
It's a daddy thing.

32
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:22,451
You're hot for your age.

33
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:25,774
You're even hotter because you used to
screw the chick who's screwing my mom,

34
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:28,194
but I don't date guys with gray pubes.

<i>Dr Jushua Lee</i>

39
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:25,829
You lying bitch.

40
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:28,613
What do you expect us to say, Matt?

41
00:03:28,713 --> 00:03:30,324
You've been lying to us for months,

42
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:33,240
spending our money on drugs,
and putting our granddaughter at risk!

43
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,952
Why didn't you just tell us the truth?
We could have helped you.

44
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:38,098
Do you have any idea
of what the permanent effects

45
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:39,728
of methamphetamine have on your brain?

46
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:42,300
I wouldn't be surprised if your
dopamine levels were cut in half.

47
00:03:42,404 --> 00:03:45,300
It's not like you can spare any, Matt.
You're a depressive personality.

48
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,180
Well, thanks to Prometa, we don't have

49
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:49,750
- that problem anymore.
- Yeah, what's that, Xenu's brother?

50
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,939
It's a specially blended
combination of medication

51
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:56,615
and nutritional supplements
designed to help suppress our cravings.

52
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:00,641
And thanks to Prometa,
we've been clean for 3 weeks now.

53
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:03,660
You do realize

54
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:07,415
there is no truly effective way
to reverse meth addiction.

55
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:10,752
Your chances of a relapse are over 80%.

56
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:14,860
We know that we're always
gonna have the urge, Sean,

57
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:16,538
but we're fighting this together.

58
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:19,316
And so, what, now you want some
"get back on your feet" money?

59
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:21,243
Well, look at me, Christian.

60
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:25,098
The drugs were hard on me.
I have got sores all over my arms.

61
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,799
This shit aged me, like, 10 years.

62
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:30,003
What's that saying,
don't give a hungry man a fish,

63
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,375
but teach him how to catch one?

64
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:35,073
We want to be self-sufficient. Kimber's
gonna model, and I'm gonna manage her.

65
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:36,543
Oh, Jesus.

66
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,600
Have you looked in the mirror
recently, Kimber?

67
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:40,334
Your face looks like a fraternity couch.

68
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:42,863
Yeah, I know. That's why I need you
to freshen me up.

69
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:45,687
I want my looks back.
They're my commodity.

70
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:47,652
I am a product.

71
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:50,207
"Crack Whore" Magazine's
next centerfold.

72
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:53,108
Look. I know how disappointed
you guys are in me.

73
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:56,941
But... look.

74
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,301
Just for now, can you at least
see us for what we've overcome?

75
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:06,859
You want plastic surgery? Go to Tijuana.

76
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,005
You want money?
I'm sure Wendy's is hiring.

77
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:11,825
You want sympathy?
Write a letter to Oprah.

78
00:05:11,972 --> 00:05:14,118
The double daddy store is closed.

79
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,134
What about Jenna?

80
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,916
Our granddaughter will want for nothing,

81
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:21,291
except parental role models.

82
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:24,387
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we have some work to do.

83
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:28,709
Make sure you take the back door out.
It's the way we take out the trash.

84
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:35,800
- Julia is gonna be pissed.
- Frankly, she's not my problem anymore.

85
00:05:35,923 --> 00:05:37,961
We can't keep enabling him.

86
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:44,400
Excuse me. Can we help you?

87
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:45,941
God, I hope so.

88
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:51,305
Shrapnel?

89
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:53,626
Edges are too clean.

90
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,707
I had the X-ray done at the
free clinic in El Segundo.

91
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,613
They don't ask questions down there.

92
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:00,522
Well, we do here in Beverly Hills.

93
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:02,834
- What is this, Mister--
- Doctor.

94
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,182
Joshua Lee.

95
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:06,343
Forgive my paranoia,

96
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:09,025
but I'd hate to put you in danger.

97
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:15,081
- What kind of doctor are you?
- Ph. D.

98
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:19,694
I'm an astrophysicist. I taught at
Harvard when that still meant something.

99
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:22,284
Look. You're gonna think I'm crazy.

100
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,366
But hear me out, please.

101
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:29,021
- You got two minutes.
- I only need one.

102
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,753
I was tracking radio waves
from deep space.

103
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:37,686
For years, we heard nothing but static,
and then, one night,

104
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,916
a series of blips.

105
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,011
You know what defines intelligence?

106
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:44,034
The ability to create patterns.

107
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:46,287
And somebody

108
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,678
or something

109
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:51,654
was out there in the dark doing it.

110
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:53,565
I'm sorry, but wouldn't we have heard

111
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:56,145
about the discovery of intelligent life
on another planet?

112
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,186
You don't think I tried?
I called in the team, my superiors...

113
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:02,975
but the pattern didn't continue.

114
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:07,262
And there wasn't any trace of it
on the recordings.

115
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:09,438
- They had erased it.
- "They"?

116
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,706
The ones that put this thing in me.

117
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:14,281
I knew too much.

118
00:07:16,342 --> 00:07:17,905
I was too close.

119
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:20,587
They had to keep tabs on me.

120
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:29,010
You have an alien implant.

121
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:31,256
They need to track me.

122
00:07:31,808 --> 00:07:33,539
The lead blocks the signal.

123
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,631
- Why don't they just kill you?
- Think I wouldn't rather be dead?

124
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:39,145
This thing aches so much.

125
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,045
All right. Let me take a look.

126
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:44,317
I guess the aliens aren't,

127
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,276
intelligent enough to prevent sepsis.

128
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,773
I picked at it with a hanger
trying to get it out.

129
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:50,923
You know,

130
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:53,390
I know I'm just
a funny story to you two,

131
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:55,283
but I researched you.

132
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:57,621
You take complicated cases.

133
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:01,572
Please, help me.

134
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:13,844
Dude! Dude! Sean. Hey, come on up.

135
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,433
What's up, my brother
from another mother?

136
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:21,467
Taking a nap?

137
00:08:21,603 --> 00:08:24,212
No, just a little afternoon delight!

138
00:08:25,096 --> 00:08:26,998
- This is Leah.
- Hey.

139
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:29,713
Dutch oven. Dutch oven!

140
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,453
- That is so gross.
- Get out of here.

141
00:08:33,474 --> 00:08:36,378
- No, no, not you! Not you. You.
- OK.

142
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,083
Get out. Go on. Go.

143
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:42,842
- How old is she?
- 18, I think.

144
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:46,230
When you're a senior in high school,
that makes you 18, right?

145
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:50,926
Hey, don't get all
east-coast judgy on me, Sean.

146
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:53,533
Come on. There is no shame
in dating a young girl.

147
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:55,558
I mean, this is Hollywood, right?

148
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,967
I mean, that's why we come here. I mean,
they're tight as a chinchilla's ass,

149
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:01,105
and they don't care
if you listen to them because

150
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:03,667
most of the time,
they've got nothing to say.

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,570
But... how do you keep them interested?

152
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:08,369
You must be 10 years older than she is.

153
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,231
- Try 20.
- Who did your work?

154
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:12,414
I've never been under the knife.

155
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:15,306
Well, except for when
I had my dick shortened.

156
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,111
I'm kidding.

157
00:09:19,478 --> 00:09:22,010
I'm kidding. No, honestly, Doc,
I hate to break it to you,

158
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:24,318
but I think plastic surgery's
a little 20th century.

159
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:27,471
I mean, hormones, colonics, thermage--
that's the new age.

160
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:29,985
A good I.V. push can keep
your hair from going gray

161
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:31,647
way more than a Grecian formula.

162
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:38,118
I got this, uh, Indian doctor.

163
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:41,174
He is <i>the</i> L.A. guru.

164
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:44,537
I'm not kidding. I don't know
what he puts in his I.V.'s, but, dude,

165
00:09:44,837 --> 00:09:46,065
that shit is magic.

166
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,625
Can I get his number?
Just... for research purposes.

167
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:53,485
Oh, screw that. I'm going mañana.
Why don't you come with?

168
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:55,947
Uh, I'm actually kind of busy tomorrow.

169
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:58,326
Well, that's perfect. We'll come to you.

170
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:01,765
OK.

171
00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:18,121
What do you want, Kimber?

172
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:21,468
You... inside of me.

173
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:29,185
What makes you think
I want to stick my dick

174
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:32,202
inside that cesspool
of a vagina of yours,

175
00:10:33,102 --> 00:10:36,197
risk having it being bitten off
by one of those

176
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:39,339
Alaskan king crabs you got
swimming around down there?

177
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,523
Get out.

178
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:52,371
Christian,

179
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,023
I need you to do my surgery.

180
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:59,695
Telling the truth isn't gonna
make me change my mind.

181
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,637
You want more of the truth?

182
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,943
I am going back into porn.

183
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:12,421
I guess if you're gonna be a degenerate
slut, you might as well get paid for it.

184
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:14,533
But I'm not gonna do your surgery.

185
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:17,238
How many times do we have
to go down this road, Kimber?

186
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,146
I'll break up with Matt.

187
00:11:19,353 --> 00:11:20,892
I thought you two were in love.

188
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,997
I screwed up, OK?

189
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:32,163
But my life doesn't have to be over.

190
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:37,834
Fine.

191
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:39,569
But I get Jenna, too.

192
00:11:40,695 --> 00:11:43,438
Sign over custody to Matt,
and you get your pretty face back.

193
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:49,327
You ok?

194
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:52,513
You haven't said a word
since we left the shop.

195
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:57,826
Look. I've had plenty of girls
with sexual problems.

196
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:00,870
And who's the common denominator
in that equation?

197
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:03,423
All right, enough.
Do you want this or not?

198
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:07,146
Why do you keep asking?
You wanted the sex toy,

199
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:09,383
- we got the sex toy.
- Not the toy!

200
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:10,572
Me.

201
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:14,874
All my friends told me not
to date a straight girl.

202
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:20,383
This again. Why do I have to decide
whether I'm gay or whether I'm straight?

203
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:23,304
Choosing your sexuality
is a commitment to me.

204
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:25,695
I'm in love with you,

205
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,724
and I need to know
that I'm not alone here.

206
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:31,029
- Excuse me. Are you finished?
- Just a minute, please.

207
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:33,745
Step over here. This is loaded.

208
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:36,129
You're going to take out all
the money you can here.

209
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,299
Then we are going to get
into your car.

210
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:54,013
What's your name?

211
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:55,387
Can I please go?

212
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:56,951
Please, can I go?

213
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:00,324
There's another one. Pull over.

214
00:13:00,515 --> 00:13:03,318
What's the point?
I-- I can't take out any more.

215
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:08,325
Bullshit.

216
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,079
No. This is the sixth ATM

217
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:14,117
that we've tried,
and I have a limit on my card.

218
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:21,075
Look...

219
00:13:22,456 --> 00:13:25,109
Please, please,
can-- can you let us go?

220
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:27,059
You can have my jewelry.

221
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,006
What are you two?

222
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:34,636
Girlfriends.

223
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:38,408
That's what I figured,
the way you were going at it.

224
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:43,660
Where are we going?

225
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:47,935
North.

226
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:03,666
Is she always this way?

227
00:14:05,698 --> 00:14:08,997
When she's scared,
then I think she has a right to be.

228
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:11,978
But you are not scared.

229
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:14,784
Are you the man?

230
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,197
Up there. Pull in up there.

231
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:27,692
Right over there.

232
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:33,003
Come on.

233
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,759
Go stand there in the light
where I can see you.

234
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,465
In the light.

235
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:40,480
Stop right there.

236
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,855
Now take off your clothes,
down to your bra and panties.

237
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:50,144
We-- we have more money, and...

238
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:51,726
I have $2,000--

239
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:52,762
Strip!

240
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:08,694
Will you calm her down?

241
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:11,490
Hug her.

242
00:15:14,037 --> 00:15:14,953
Kiss her.

243
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,413
Kiss her.

244
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,836
Help me. Please.

245
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:28,883
Use it.

246
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:31,138
Use it on her.

247
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:34,724
Use it on yourself, asshole!

248
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:39,805
Are you testing me?

249
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,309
I've killed people before.

250
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:48,194
Then just do it already!

251
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:52,421
Turn around.

252
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:55,232
Turn around!

253
00:16:05,073 --> 00:16:06,172
Walk.

254
00:16:14,044 --> 00:16:15,045
Oh, please.

255
00:16:37,086 --> 00:16:38,232
He's gone.

256
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,420
He's gone.

257
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:43,129
He's gone! Oh, my god!

258
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:45,257
He's gone.

259
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:13,855
This poor girl.
Trouble just walks alongside her.

260
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:17,523
Screw her. How many times have
I fixed the outside of this succubus?

261
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:19,525
And what changes on the inside, huh?
Nothing.

262
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:22,666
You know the definition of madness?

263
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,269
When you keep doing the same thing
over and over and over

264
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:27,872
expecting different results.

265
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:31,630
The only thing mad about her is
that she still has feelings for you.

266
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:34,225
Well, there comes a point
when you just have to let go.

267
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:37,368
Kimber has a disease of the soul.
Get too close,

268
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:38,968
you catch it.

269
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:42,015
Dr. Troy?

270
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,705
The police are on the phone.
It's Julia.

271
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:51,745
They called from an emergency callbox
up north off of 5.

272
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:55,563
If you ask me, they are lucky
to be breathing. Right here.

273
00:17:58,115 --> 00:17:59,390
Are you ok?

274
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:02,078
I'm so sorry.

275
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:05,371
We're fine.

276
00:18:06,123 --> 00:18:08,377
We just need to go home
and have a hot shower.

277
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,233
I don't even know why Julia called you.

278
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:12,263
I'm sure the police would
have given us a ride.

279
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:13,554
I just want to see the kids.

280
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:16,886
- Can I take them home?
- I'd like to do a rape kit first.

281
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:20,827
What? He raped you?

282
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,555
No. Uh, we already told you that.

283
00:18:24,024 --> 00:18:26,833
Well, honestly, a lot of women say
that on the night of an attack.

284
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:30,104
Are you kidding me?

285
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:32,242
These women have been terrorized.
Now you want to violate them as well?

286
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:35,239
Look. I'm just trying to do my job.
I mean, this guy could do

287
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:36,958
this again, and I would hate
to lose evidence because

288
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:38,358
they went home and they took a shower.

289
00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:41,087
No, julia, I want to go home.

290
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,652
Why don't you take your rape kit,

291
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:45,137
put it next to your box of doughnuts,
and go arrest some bad guys?

292
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:47,374
Let's go.

293
00:18:56,691 --> 00:18:58,969
Hey, Seannie,
you name me one doctor--

294
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,893
I don't care what country he's from--
still makes house calls.

295
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,059
Name one who charges $1,200 an hour
and doesn't take insurance.

296
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:06,085
I heard that.

297
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,893
I can't laugh.

298
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,485
You feel that?

299
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,999
That's the radioactive waves heating the
skin and stimulating collagen growth.

300
00:19:13,256 --> 00:19:15,487
I know how it works, Aidan.
I'm a doctor, remember?

301
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:17,482
When we're done here,
we're gonna look younger

302
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:18,642
than the Olsen twins.

303
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,486
I need to be honest with you.

304
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:25,140
I'm not doing this for research.

305
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:26,913
I'm seeing a girl.

306
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:29,461
A young girl.

307
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:32,998
What is she, 17? Because
I got a guy that can fix all that up.

308
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:35,520
- Yeah, birth certificate--
- No, no, no, she's 18.

309
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,913
She's my ex-wife's
girlfriend's daughter.

310
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:43,170
Dude, the sexual permutations
are frying my brain.

311
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:45,926
All I can think about are
the 50 different ways it's wrong.

312
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,685
Guilt is the number
one negative chi producer.

313
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:53,514
If you let that fester,
it will age you, Seannie.

314
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:56,433
I need you to exhale and let it go.

315
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:02,902
I'm going to begin the I.V.
push treatments now.

316
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:11,203
I feel flushed. Is that Niacin?

317
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:14,578
And magnesium phosphorous and

318
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:16,927
4 times the daily requirement
of vitamin C.

319
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,187
All the skin vitamins.

320
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:20,119
Is this really gonna take away my gray?

321
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,256
Look at me. I got the hair
of a 12-year-old boy.

322
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:25,862
I'm sad you're so
hung up on this one girl.

323
00:20:26,621 --> 00:20:28,722
Dude, teenagers are supposed to be fun.

324
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:31,688
You know? It's like candy on
a conveyor belt. One passes you by,

325
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,816
look. There's 20 more
coming of age right now.

326
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:38,570
No. I'm cutting off girls
born after '79.

327
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:40,932
This was an exception and a mistake.

328
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,940
Really? So that's
why you're doing all this?

329
00:20:44,335 --> 00:20:46,332
You want to know why she dumped you?

330
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:48,493
Because you showed her that you cared.

331
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,515
Teenagers are insecure.

332
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:53,394
You let on that you like them, they're
gonna think something's wrong with you.

333
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:54,604
Not Eden.

334
00:20:56,911 --> 00:21:00,339
All right. All I'm gonna say is,
the harder the chocolaty outside,

335
00:21:00,765 --> 00:21:02,104
the gooier the nougaty inside.

336
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,021
You know what I'm saying?

337
00:21:05,437 --> 00:21:08,470
I'm having a big bash this weekend.
Why don't you come by?

338
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:10,732
There'll be cocaine, young girls.

339
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,223
Huh? What do you say?

340
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,276
You and Aidan done jerking
each other off?

341
00:21:21,506 --> 00:21:24,229
I think he looks great.
Give me your guru's number.

342
00:21:24,497 --> 00:21:25,930
Did he wax your vaginas as well?

343
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:30,114
My skin is tight, my chi is aligned,
and I feel 10 years younger.

344
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,644
You should try it, Christian.

345
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,211
You're looking a little rough
around the edges.

346
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:37,247
Don't you worry about it, but Julia
and Olivia got carjacked last night.

347
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,279
What? Are they ok?

348
00:21:39,543 --> 00:21:40,377
Physically.

349
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:42,115
I picked them up from
the police station this morning.

350
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,302
I should call them.

351
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:45,260
Don't worry. She'll be
in here this afternoon.

352
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:46,859
She needs to talk to the both of us.

353
00:21:48,444 --> 00:21:50,933
When did this happen?
I mean, I didn't get any messages.

354
00:21:52,415 --> 00:21:54,564
She called me because
I'm good when things get hot.

355
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:55,926
And I'm not?

356
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,498
Look. We're all just friends, right?

357
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:01,195
I wouldn't worry about it.

358
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:10,229
You have any idea what the hell this is?

359
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:12,915
It's a microchip,
but there's no serial number.

360
00:22:13,068 --> 00:22:14,858
I've seen one of those before...

361
00:22:15,706 --> 00:22:17,943
on the websites about alien abduction.

362
00:22:18,743 --> 00:22:21,079
That's exactly
what an implant looks like.

363
00:22:21,263 --> 00:22:24,128
Whenever I wonder why you're single,
you have ways of letting me know.

364
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:25,519
Tease me all you want,

365
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:28,763
but I saw a ufo in Miami, Christian,

366
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,147
and I was not the only one.

367
00:22:31,632 --> 00:22:33,274
Come on, Liz. This is man made.

368
00:22:33,498 --> 00:22:35,165
Then how did this get in his back?

369
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:37,855
And why doesn't it have
any markings inside?

370
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:40,952
You think creatures
who are intelligent enough

371
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,477
to travel through space
aren't smart enough to create

372
00:22:43,735 --> 00:22:45,637
devices made out of carbon?

373
00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:54,376
Jeez.

374
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:04,449
Send that out for tests.

375
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,011
Where?

376
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:17,643
Are you sure you want to do this?

377
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:21,520
I brought you guys here for support,
not to talk me out of it.

378
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,200
- I support you.
- We both do.

379
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,695
Buying a gun is a completely
appropriate reaction

380
00:23:25,815 --> 00:23:27,023
- for what happened to you.
- Thank you.

381
00:23:27,143 --> 00:23:30,060
You're far more likely to be killed
by your own gun than a criminal's.

382
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:32,090
That's not what you said
after your attack.

383
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,684
A republican is a democrat,
who's been mugged.

384
00:23:35,203 --> 00:23:36,602
That's a.45.

385
00:23:37,534 --> 00:23:40,007
My girl digs it
because it fits in her hand.

386
00:23:41,514 --> 00:23:42,439
Pick it up.

387
00:23:46,368 --> 00:23:48,602
- Oh, yeah. That is heavy.
- Look at it like a

388
00:23:48,753 --> 00:23:50,482
cell phone on a long drive.

389
00:23:50,602 --> 00:23:53,308
You never have to use it.
It's all about state of mind.

390
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:57,932
Ok. I'm gonna say it.

391
00:23:58,431 --> 00:23:59,559
This is insane.

392
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:02,966
Julia, you were the victim
of a random attack. One in a million.

393
00:24:03,086 --> 00:24:06,152
- This is an overreaction.
- Why are you so upset about this?

394
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:08,950
- Because my kids live with you.
- So get a lock.

395
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:12,072
You know, I'm not sure she should
be taking advice from a man whose idea

396
00:24:12,192 --> 00:24:13,987
of taking responsibility is pulling out.

397
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:16,661
Would you two shut up?

398
00:24:20,662 --> 00:24:26,183
I think that this will fit
in my purse and, um...

399
00:24:29,376 --> 00:24:30,448
I'll take it.

400
00:26:10,244 --> 00:26:13,490
The chip works as sort of a lojack,
except for people.

401
00:26:13,618 --> 00:26:16,126
And I realize that sounds really cruel,

402
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:19,665
but this is the third time my father's
wandered away from the nursing home.

403
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:22,649
And the last time, he almost died
from hypothermia.

404
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:24,462
We're just happy
it started working again.

405
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,253
This is not my daughter.
My daughter is fat.

406
00:26:27,464 --> 00:26:30,253
Dr. Lee, this is your daughter Wendy.

407
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,314
She has the I.D.
and your medical file to prove it.

408
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:37,176
And you have Alzheimer's disease, which
is making you very confused right now,

409
00:26:37,317 --> 00:26:39,003
but you don't have
to worry about anything.

410
00:26:39,123 --> 00:26:42,157
They'll tell you anything
to discredit me.

411
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,790
- I've come too close.
- Ok. Ok, daddy,

412
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,129
- it's time to go now, all right?
- Get your hand off me.

413
00:26:48,328 --> 00:26:50,930
I won't go with her. Look at me.

414
00:26:51,084 --> 00:26:52,608
I'm not crazy.

415
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:55,127
These men are from the care facility.

416
00:26:55,432 --> 00:26:56,907
They're gonna take
real good care of you.

417
00:26:57,027 --> 00:27:01,256
It's 2007. George Bush is president.
The Celtics are good again.

418
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:02,441
I don't want to go with them.

419
00:27:02,652 --> 00:27:06,238
Please! I don't want to go with them.
I don't want to go--

420
00:27:54,681 --> 00:27:57,669
Dude! Dude!

421
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:00,821
Oh, the doctor's
in the house, everybody.

422
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:03,353
This is the debate team.

423
00:28:03,534 --> 00:28:04,705
Oh, hi.

424
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,586
All right, girls, you can take off.

425
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:09,515
Why don't you go argue with somebody?

426
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:11,352
Seriously, take off.

427
00:28:11,504 --> 00:28:14,469
But I'm gonna be checking your notes
to see who won, Cheryl.

428
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,989
I don't even know if that's her name.

429
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:19,651
Hey, so, what do you think of my theme?
I got this whole hell thing going.

430
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:21,567
I call it Dante's Infernal.

431
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:23,315
I was actually thinking
about going home.

432
00:28:24,232 --> 00:28:27,141
Whoa! You can't go home.
Come on. You're my wing man.

433
00:28:27,261 --> 00:28:29,592
You never abandon your wing man.
Didn't you see "Top Gun"?

434
00:28:29,712 --> 00:28:32,310
I appreciate the effort.
This just isn't for me.

435
00:28:32,604 --> 00:28:34,493
What? Good energy's not for you

436
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,068
- or some women?
- Oh, shit.

437
00:28:39,337 --> 00:28:41,095
That's her.

438
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:46,213
Wow. She's like a little lion cub.

439
00:28:46,388 --> 00:28:48,432
I, uh, I got to go.

440
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:50,458
Oh, no, no, no. Well, do you want her?

441
00:28:53,177 --> 00:28:54,395
- Yes.
- Yeah.

442
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,486
Ok. Chug.

443
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:09,243
- That's it. Now we're--
- Excuse me, ladies.

444
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:12,794
Just made a little jump.

445
00:29:14,727 --> 00:29:16,872
- Sean.
- Hey!

446
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:19,214
You know my boy Sean?

447
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:20,843
What are you doing here?

448
00:29:24,382 --> 00:29:26,843
Abby, panty time. Let's go.

449
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:28,546
Panty-- right here.

450
00:29:32,007 --> 00:29:33,460
Who's next?

451
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,374
- Come, get a drink with me.
- I'll catch up.

452
00:29:39,704 --> 00:29:41,438
What do you have left, Abby?

453
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:45,024
I'm killing.

454
00:29:48,623 --> 00:29:50,369
That was nice work.

455
00:29:57,603 --> 00:29:59,267
Step off, Rexy.

456
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:11,601
- Hey.
- Hey.

457
00:30:15,457 --> 00:30:17,672
Want to go somewhere private?

458
00:30:24,228 --> 00:30:25,633
Impressive.

459
00:30:25,753 --> 00:30:29,185
I got a little obsessed with personal
safety after I got attacked.

460
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:31,567
Thanks for doing this
with me here today.

461
00:30:31,687 --> 00:30:33,606
You know, I couldn't have done it alone.

462
00:30:33,726 --> 00:30:37,218
And Sean can be so judgmental
about these things.

463
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,414
You've always come to me when you needed
strength. How's Olivia?

464
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:43,483
Like it never happened.

465
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:46,273
I'd be in denial, too,
if I fell apart like she did.

466
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:48,411
You know, that is not fair, Christian.

467
00:30:48,531 --> 00:30:51,404
Oh, come on. You can't tell me you
weren't shocked by the way she reacted.

468
00:30:51,524 --> 00:30:55,147
Fine. I was surprised, ok?

469
00:30:56,084 --> 00:30:58,311
Well, that's what you get
for dating a woman.

470
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:00,197
No wonder you want a gun.

471
00:31:03,937 --> 00:31:04,863
Now it's your turn.

472
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,533
Remember, you have to start
a relationship with it. Without you,

473
00:31:08,662 --> 00:31:11,744
then it's just a paperweight, ok?

474
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:14,190
Now put the magazine in.

475
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:21,643
Excellent.

476
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:26,612
Ok, now spread your legs
and bend your knees.

477
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:31,024
So raise the gun.

478
00:31:31,762 --> 00:31:34,598
There you go. And aim it.

479
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:38,184
Then move your finger over the trigger.

480
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:41,266
Good.

481
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:45,356
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

482
00:31:46,652 --> 00:31:48,586
Feels good, don't it?

483
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:49,816
Ok.

484
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:58,403
Now squeeze.

485
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:25,605
Hey. What are you doing?

486
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,445
Packing.

487
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:35,948
- Where did you get this?
- I had to steal it.

488
00:32:37,445 --> 00:32:39,789
Certainly you couldn't afford it.

489
00:32:43,703 --> 00:32:45,358
Are we going somewhere?

490
00:32:45,478 --> 00:32:48,961
You are going nowhere,
which is why I am leaving.

491
00:32:49,565 --> 00:32:52,237
I don't understand.
I thought we were doing good here.

492
00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:55,458
Have you looked at this place?

493
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,882
- I got a job.
- Oh, really?

494
00:32:58,002 --> 00:32:59,395
Where? Burger King?

495
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:04,415
Oh, my God. I knew it.

496
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,919
Look, I made a deal with Christian.

497
00:33:08,315 --> 00:33:11,197
He does my surgery, I dump you.

498
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,335
Oh, I thought he was doing that for us,
you know, to help us.

499
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:18,376
That's what I told you, but I lied.

500
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:23,962
You know, he's just manipulating
you again, Kimber.

501
00:33:24,082 --> 00:33:27,135
No, he's not, because it was my idea.

502
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:34,639
And no matter how good he can
make me look, I can't move forward

503
00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:36,805
carrying your dead weight.

504
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,051
- I love you.
- Oh! Stop. Please, Matt.

505
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:41,514
You're pathetic.

506
00:33:42,393 --> 00:33:45,686
Where did you get those earrings?
Did you have to steal those, too?

507
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:47,772
Ram gave them to me.

508
00:33:48,557 --> 00:33:50,526
We're relaunching the Kimber Doll.

509
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:54,675
You know, it was a celebratory gift.

510
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:57,932
Did you sleep with him?

511
00:34:00,276 --> 00:34:01,378
Of course I did.

512
00:34:03,264 --> 00:34:05,386
And it was the first time

513
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:08,128
that I have come in months.

514
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:14,039
Christ.

515
00:34:15,864 --> 00:34:19,051
I... I am so sorry.

516
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,594
So, um...

517
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:30,137
So what about Jenna?

518
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:32,316
Jenna will be at Ram's with the nanny,

519
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:36,893
and that's where she will be staying
when I am not with her.

520
00:34:44,134 --> 00:34:47,439
- You can't take her away from me.
- Oh, really?

521
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:50,621
You want to fight me,
Johnny Burger King?

522
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:54,458
Ram adores her, ok?

523
00:34:54,669 --> 00:34:56,861
And he's got a lot of money.

524
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:12,555
I never loved you, Matt.

525
00:35:12,883 --> 00:35:15,579
I told you I did, but I lied.

526
00:35:18,665 --> 00:35:20,646
And I'm really sorry.

527
00:35:21,115 --> 00:35:23,728
I hope some day we can be friends.

528
00:36:13,209 --> 00:36:14,815
I can't come.

529
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,154
It's the "e."

530
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:20,498
Here. Try this.

531
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:26,267
Ohh, too hard?

532
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:31,005
- What's wrong, Sean?
- Call 911.

533
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:33,294
I'm having a heart attack.

534
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:46,735
Jesus. Sean, are you ok?

535
00:36:47,544 --> 00:36:49,466
I called you both. Is that all right?

536
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:51,158
Of course it is!

537
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,298
Some week you're having, huh, Jules?

538
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,938
Honey, what happened?

539
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,329
The nurse said that you
might have had a heart attack.

540
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:02,707
He didn't have a heart attack.
He had an adverse reaction to ecstasy.

541
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,852
Jesus Christ, man. You know there's
an age limit to that shit.

542
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,039
It's like listening to fall out boy.

543
00:37:11,317 --> 00:37:14,235
It's that cocknocker Aidan Stone.
He's a bad influence on him.

544
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,063
Aidan didn't give it to me.

545
00:37:16,885 --> 00:37:18,608
Well, then who did?

546
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,647
Eden.

547
00:37:22,694 --> 00:37:24,369
We're having

548
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:28,459
- an affair, sort of.
- Sort of?

549
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:32,288
- Sean, she's a child.
- She's 18.

550
00:37:32,393 --> 00:37:34,152
And I didn't call you down here
to judge me.

551
00:37:34,272 --> 00:37:36,410
Could you just be my friend right now?
Is that all right?

552
00:37:36,538 --> 00:37:42,695
No. I mean, even if I could get past
the fact that you have had sex with yet

553
00:37:42,815 --> 00:37:46,659
another barely legal girl,
what am I meant to do,

554
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:49,552
smile and just stroke your bruised ego

555
00:37:49,672 --> 00:37:51,508
when you've slept
with my girlfriend's daughter?

556
00:37:51,628 --> 00:37:54,003
- It had nothing to do with you.
- Bullshit, Sean!

557
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:57,169
There are a hundred starlets
you could have bedded. Sh...

558
00:38:01,118 --> 00:38:02,524
You're right.

559
00:38:02,817 --> 00:38:04,505
I don't know what I was thinking.

560
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,774
Yes, I do.

561
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,375
I'm 42 years old, and I can feel it.

562
00:38:14,398 --> 00:38:17,926
My knees creak when I walk.
I get up to pee twice a night.

563
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:23,140
You know who I am now
when I smile at twenty-something girls?

564
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,082
I'm the creepy old guy.

565
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:31,011
My flame is dying, and I can feel
the cold air coming in.

566
00:38:31,283 --> 00:38:32,771
Eden reignited me.

567
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:35,413
She was like a bucket of gasoline.

568
00:38:35,707 --> 00:38:38,909
You don't have to tell me about the
spiritual benefits of young pussy, Sean.

569
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:42,579
I've been dipping myself in those
shealing waters for years.

570
00:38:46,837 --> 00:38:48,056
Yeah, you have!

571
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,964
I'm sorry if I scared you guys.

572
00:38:58,615 --> 00:38:59,667
I didn't mean...

573
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:03,054
- I didn't mean to do any of this.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

574
00:39:03,229 --> 00:39:05,748
We've all got regrets,
made mistakes, right?

575
00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:12,028
- We're here for you.
- Thanks.

576
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:24,066
We need to talk.

577
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,874
About what, your sexual identity crisis?

578
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,112
Save it for the shrink, lesbot.

579
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,175
Listen to me, you little bitch.

580
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:35,627
You stay the hell away from Sean.

581
00:39:35,827 --> 00:39:39,096
You think this sophomoric
act is Charming?

582
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,399
It's not. You think that prancing around

583
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,173
in your plaid skirt and seducing
older men makes you special?

584
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:47,573
It doesn't. It makes you a stupid whore.

585
00:39:47,693 --> 00:39:50,566
I have deep feelings for Sean, Julia.

586
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:54,028
And I can provide him things
that you no longer can,

587
00:39:54,148 --> 00:39:58,321
such as youth and a certain tightness.

588
00:39:58,441 --> 00:40:03,564
Listen, do not screw with him
or any other member of my family.

589
00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:06,903
And you especially don't screw with me,

590
00:40:07,023 --> 00:40:10,641
or I will talk your mother
into sending you away to reform school

591
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:12,905
far, far away from us.

592
00:40:13,034 --> 00:40:15,541
Do you hear me? Good.

593
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:31,256
- Is that decaf?
- Yes, dad.

594
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:34,919
Hello. Dr. Mcnamara, Dr. Troy?

595
00:40:35,822 --> 00:40:39,372
I was wondering if you recently
treated a Dr. Joshua Lee.

596
00:40:39,656 --> 00:40:42,539
- About 6-feet, 70.
- Deep voice?

597
00:40:42,913 --> 00:40:45,890
That's him. Oh, thank God.

598
00:40:46,088 --> 00:40:48,969
When the insurance bill came,
I got this jolt of hope,

599
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:52,112
but I wouldn't let myself believe it
until I was sure.

600
00:40:52,624 --> 00:40:54,687
I'm sorry. I'm motor-mouthing.

601
00:40:57,675 --> 00:41:02,024
It's just that my father
has been missing for months.

602
00:41:02,144 --> 00:41:07,255
He just disappeared.
No change of clothes, no note.

603
00:41:08,087 --> 00:41:10,618
They had to suspend his NASA project.

604
00:41:11,055 --> 00:41:12,692
I'm sorry. Did you say your father?

605
00:41:12,856 --> 00:41:15,376
Yes. Can I see him?

606
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:21,859
- Your sister picked him up yesterday.
- I don't have a sister.

607
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:25,527
Her name is Wendy.

608
00:41:25,738 --> 00:41:28,890
That doesn't make any sense.
I'm Wendy.

609
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:36,656
- He did say she was fat.
- I have a thyroid condition.

610
00:41:39,398 --> 00:41:41,249
I don't understand.

611
00:41:41,706 --> 00:41:45,433
Why would someone claiming to be me
come and take my father away?

612
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:49,843
He's a broke scientist
who gets off looking at the stars.

613
00:41:51,394 --> 00:41:52,660
Who would do this?

614
00:41:53,484 --> 00:41:54,339
Who?

615
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,089
You asshole.

616
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:08,265
I guess Kimber lowered the boom.

617
00:42:08,587 --> 00:42:11,498
Take my advice-- move on. I just
gave you an early birthday present.

618
00:42:11,618 --> 00:42:13,288
I love her. She's all I have.

619
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:16,267
It kind of sounds like your
whole sorry-ass life, don't it?

620
00:42:16,425 --> 00:42:18,451
No money, no prospects,
and the love of your life

621
00:42:18,571 --> 00:42:21,423
is an old skank who's about
to take it up the ass again for cash.

622
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,232
You know, she took Jenna.

623
00:42:23,352 --> 00:42:25,090
Been living with some
millionaire porn producer,

624
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,195
and she won't even let me see her!

625
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:32,360
- Come here. Get in here.
- What are you doing?

626
00:42:32,513 --> 00:42:34,177
I'm trying to make a man out of you.

627
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,386
You've always been such a wheezy little
bitch. No wonder Kimber dumped you.

628
00:42:37,506 --> 00:42:38,862
What? You don't love me anymore either?

629
00:42:38,982 --> 00:42:40,162
Of course I love you. I'm your father.

630
00:42:40,282 --> 00:42:43,245
I don't want to see you until you
get your shit together, you hear me?

631
00:42:43,518 --> 00:42:45,732
You need to grow up, Matt,
and do it fast.

632
00:42:46,518 --> 00:42:49,025
Until then, consider yourself an orphan.

633
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:00,327
Is Sean home?

634
00:43:00,757 --> 00:43:03,347
No. He's at his internist's.

635
00:43:03,593 --> 00:43:04,542
Why?

636
00:43:12,431 --> 00:43:14,201
I need you.

637
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:16,486
Make love to me.

638
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,537
Take care of me.

639
00:44:16,325 --> 00:44:17,421
Jesus!

640
00:44:54,973 --> 00:44:57,451
