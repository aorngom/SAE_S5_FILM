1
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:59,229
Oh, my god. Is that me?

2
00:00:59,987 --> 00:01:03,379
Your reflection may be shocking for a while, but you'll get used to it.

3
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,239
I actually think you look wonderful.

4
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,024
Thanks.

5
00:01:07,227 --> 00:01:09,451
It feels like a stranger is staring back at me.

6
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:13,217
I just don't know how I'm supposed to take a shower.

7
00:01:13,314 --> 00:01:16,310
I can't let this girl see me naked. I barely know her.

8
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:17,527
How do you like it, Austin?

9
00:01:17,624 --> 00:01:20,211
I think Dr. McNamara did a bang-up job.

10
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,088
When is it gonna stop hurting?

11
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:24,898
In a week you'll be taking nothing but aspirin, if that.

12
00:01:24,993 --> 00:01:29,601
Which is good because I've just been told that your safe house will be ready by then.

13
00:01:29,692 --> 00:01:31,383
Oh, really? Where are they sending us?

14
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:34,427
I hope it's someplace warm. I requested someplace with no snow.

15
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:36,591
I am not gonna shovel any more driveways.

16
00:01:36,712 --> 00:01:38,822
Dr. McNamara, would you mind excusing us?

17
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:42,043
You're not cleared to hear about the Morrettis' future location.

18
00:01:42,153 --> 00:01:44,195
It's for your safety as well as theirs.

19
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,047
Of course.

20
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:50,229
W-wait.

21
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:54,098
If he doesn't know where we're going, how is he gonna get in touch with us?

22
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:56,204
Oh, he can't, sweetheart.

23
00:01:56,303 --> 00:01:58,039
Can he at least give us his address?

24
00:01:58,128 --> 00:02:00,039
So I can send him a postcard or something?

25
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:01,027
I'm afraid not, son.

26
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:02,706
What's the harm in him knowing where I live?

27
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,102
I'm certainly not gonna talk to anyone.

28
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:07,311
Any attempt he makes to locate you or anyone from his old life

29
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:09,097
could compromise his location.

30
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:11,142
You'll all have to say your good-byes here.

31
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:13,745
First you mess up my face

32
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:16,064
and now you tell me who I can be friends with?

33
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:17,735
I hate this!

34
00:02:19,657 --> 00:02:22,243
Your bedside manner leaves something to be desired.

35
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:25,151
You've never been in combat, Dr. McNamara.

36
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:29,013
Following protocol saves many more lives than being sensitive.

37
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:33,148
That boy is gonna need more than protocol to survive what he's going through.

38
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,252
Austin is missing.

39
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,977
All of his things are gone, too.

40
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:51,504
Relax, Nikki. This is a government compound. He can't just walk out.

41
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:54,638
Austin and I have found 5 unguarded exits to this place since we've been here.

42
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,952
These are the things you do when people are trying to kill you.

43
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:59,477
I knew all of this was too much for him. What if he goes home and they see him?

44
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:02,928
They're gonna kill him on the spot, or they're gonna use him to get to me.

45
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,850
I have got to find him.

46
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:07,676
Wait. I think I know where he's going. This is my fault.

47
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:09,336
I gave him my address on the sly.

48
00:03:09,412 --> 00:03:12,915
I figured even if he never used it, it might make him feel better.

49
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:15,945
I'm 2 hours from here. I'll go, bring him back.

50
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:17,106
You'll take me with you.

51
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:19,775
You can't leave this compound. You'll only be endangering yourself.

52
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,652
You know the rules. You agreed to them.

53
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:24,105
You knew the rules, too. That didn't stop you.

54
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:17,677
Tell me... what you like about yourself.

55
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:19,366
I'm a medalist.

56
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:22,857
I won this,

57
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:24,791
good friends games.

58
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,839
I run 440.

59
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,406
Round the track.

60
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:32,271
Tom's not the fastest, but he's got more endurance than all of them.

61
00:04:33,698 --> 00:04:37,233
Uh, tell us what we can do for you, Tommy.

62
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:40,479
I want look like my family.

63
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:43,029
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

64
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,887
Tommy is the oldest of 3, 2 boys and a girl.

65
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:48,345
- The other kids are...
- Normal.

66
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:51,854
We don't like to use that word. All of our children are special.

67
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:55,275
I got Down Syndrome. This not my fault.

68
00:04:55,377 --> 00:04:58,377
I'm born this way. I didn't choose it.

69
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:04,850
All I want is to look like the people that I love.

70
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:11,131
What's wrong with that?

71
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:13,549
Nothing.

72
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:17,040
I can see why you want to.

73
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:19,279
You have a very nice-looking family.

74
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,410
You're lucky.

75
00:05:20,532 --> 00:05:21,647
Why?

76
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:25,696
Your family is ugly, Dr. Troy?

77
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:30,694
No, not exactly. I--

78
00:05:31,822 --> 00:05:33,531
I don't really have a family.

79
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,183
That's sad.

80
00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:41,384
What you're talking about would require 8-10 surgeries.

81
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,622
Ok.

82
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:47,690
Mr. Sherrod at the bead store

83
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,366
give me more time off.

84
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:55,581
Uh, time isn't as much of a problem as money.

85
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:58,671
The cost of the surgeries is $60,000.

86
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,006
Uh, we've saved a dollar here or there, but we don't have close to that amount.

87
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:07,141
Could we work out some sort of a payment plan, a discount?

88
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:09,421
We've heard you do pro bono work sometimes.

89
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:12,088
We're under a new management group that frowns upon us

90
00:06:12,157 --> 00:06:14,581
performing unnecessary procedures for free.

91
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:18,905
Unnecessary? What makes Tommy's surgery any less necessary than some boob job?

92
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:22,940
Absolutely nothing, but we don't perform boob jobs for free either.

93
00:06:23,046 --> 00:06:24,224
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,169
Congratulations on your medal, Tommy.

95
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,471
Thank you.

96
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:49,797
It's broken.

97
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,113
You didn't have to be such an asshole to the Boltons.

98
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,461
Well, I like to I save my sensitivity for paying customers.

99
00:06:56,608 --> 00:07:00,355
This business needs to be a bullet train, not the little engine that could.

100
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:02,423
Well, I'm gonna give them a discount.

101
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:05,460
No, you're not, because this is not the make a wish foundation.

102
00:07:05,546 --> 00:07:08,645
Christian, don't let your sympathy for the patient cloud your judgment.

103
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:11,733
Besides, you're just setting him up for a bigger disappointment.

104
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:14,087
His life is a disappointment.

105
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,908
All he wants is to feel like a part of his family.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,184
He is a part of his family.

107
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,263
You don't understand what it's like to share blood with somebody

108
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:21,676
and yet feel like you don't connect?

109
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:23,266
You wanna reconnect with somebody?

110
00:07:23,387 --> 00:07:25,831
How about Julia McNamara?

111
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:29,837
De La Mer is blowing up. We've gotta make that exclusive deal with them.

112
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,228
Our clients should be filling every one of those beds,

113
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:34,324
and Julia should be paying us for the privilege.

114
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,850
De La Merde is a glorified massage parlor.

115
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:42,962
And once everybody finds out that its proprietors are a dyke, a whore, and a housewife,

116
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,279
those 3 businesswomen will be stuck giving rub and tugs just to keep their client list up.

117
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:50,920
Oh, that's fine. You have your pride,

118
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,431
but if we don't do something to regain our marketability, quickly,

119
00:07:55,544 --> 00:07:59,206
well, you're the one that's gonna be giving out free hand jobs to keep the business afloat.

120
00:08:18,352 --> 00:08:21,690
Don't ever do anything like that to me again, do you understand?

121
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:30,792
Dr. McNamara?

122
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:32,021
What is it, Austin?

123
00:08:32,124 --> 00:08:33,636
Can I use your bathroom?

124
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:36,855
Yeah, it's down the hall on the left.

125
00:08:40,222 --> 00:08:41,929
Aye, if somebody had told me it would be this hard,

126
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:43,986
I would have stayed at home and let them kill me.

127
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:49,039
You want something to drink?

128
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:54,234
I'd imagine the O.J. and milk have gone bad since I left, but I might have some soda.

129
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:57,373
I would kill for a cold beer.

130
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:07,836
Want a glass?

131
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:11,069
No, just shoot it directly into my veins.

132
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,593
Thank you...

133
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,127
for this, for everything.

134
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:25,151
You've been, like, a godsend to Austin and me.

135
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:26,970
You're like our guardian angel.

136
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:30,582
I like the way you see me.

137
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,787
This is a nice house.

138
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:38,717
Elegant,

139
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:41,599
but still lived in,

140
00:09:41,843 --> 00:09:45,115
like someone should be baking cookies in the kitchen or something.

141
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:50,407
My wife and I redid the whole thing when we moved in, took us a year.

142
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,126
We raised 2 kids in this house,

143
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:58,400
but it hasn't felt like home, few months.

144
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:02,033
It's just haunted by the ghosts of the family that used to live here.

145
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:04,952
Consider yourself lucky.

146
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:10,034
It's better to be haunted by the ghosts of good memories than the ghosts of bad ones.

147
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:13,203
Austin, are you ok?

148
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:17,726
Austin.

149
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:28,052
I should wake him up.

150
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:29,854
No, let him sleep.

151
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:34,843
We have to get back. Sagamore's gonna have our heads.

152
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:44,644
Sagamore doesn't even know we're missing yet.

153
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,705
Your safe house isn't gonna be ready for a week.

154
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:51,002
You can finish healing here.

155
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:54,023
We're damaged goods, Sean.

156
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:56,137
Having us here makes you a target, too.

157
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:58,402
Target to who? No one knows we're here.

158
00:10:58,804 --> 00:11:00,884
This place needs a family,

159
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:03,379
even if it's just for a week.

160
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:08,128
You're gonna disappear in a week.

161
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:09,998
We'll never see each other again,

162
00:11:10,197 --> 00:11:12,510
just another couple of ghosts.

163
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:15,163
All we're gonna have left is our memories.

164
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:16,993
Let's make 'em good ones.

165
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,671
$36 for chicken?

166
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:30,871
Don't worry about it, mom.

167
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:41,127
I'm sorry for what I said to you at the police station.

168
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:45,769
I looked at you and I saw him, and I--

169
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:49,035
I just assumed that you were one and the same.

170
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:50,802
That's all right.

171
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:56,750
The circumstance wasn't really set up for a dream reunion.

172
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,246
So, why track me down now?

173
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:03,414
That police business was weeks ago. What changed?

174
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:08,313
A young man with Down Syndrome came into the office the other day for a consultation,

175
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:12,601
and he wanted us to make him look more like his family.

176
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:16,176
Something he said just kind of stuck with me.

177
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:22,900
He said that it wasn't his fault that he looked the way that he did, that it was just his lot.

178
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,602
I'm--I'm sorry, Christian, but

179
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:29,061
how does that relate to me?

180
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:32,455
He inspired me to call you.

181
00:12:33,006 --> 00:12:36,656
He hasn't let his condition stop him from being a part of his family,

182
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:44,110
and I don't wanna let how I came to be stop me from being a part of my family,

183
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:46,694
from having a mother.

184
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:52,595
I don't blame you for what your father did to me.

185
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:57,158
That's good, because I wanna be a part of your life,

186
00:12:57,242 --> 00:13:00,757
not just the personification of a...

187
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:02,862
bad memory.

188
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:09,467
What's this?

189
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,379
It's a mother's day gift.

190
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:14,626
It's actually 40 mother's day gifts.

191
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:26,524
Oh, you wanna give me plastic surgery?

192
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,475
Should I be insulted?

193
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:30,992
No, not at all. You're beautiful,

194
00:13:31,084 --> 00:13:34,369
but everybody has something they've always wanted spruced up.

195
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:37,633
Well, this is very generous of you, Christian, but,

196
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:40,469
I mean, I hardly even wear much makeup.

197
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:43,123
This is an $11 haircut.

198
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:46,081
And-- you don't owe me anything.

199
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:50,522
Did you know that when a person goes through a life-altering trauma the way that you did,

200
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:54,418
hormones are released that actually speed up the aging process?

201
00:13:54,516 --> 00:13:58,313
Kind of like when somebody goes gray because they're stressed or because of fear.

202
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,521
Those tiny lines around your eyes or your mouth,

203
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,275
the slight droop in your jaw line, it's--

204
00:14:07,802 --> 00:14:09,949
I'm somewhat responsible for that.

205
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:13,965
Just come in for a consultation.

206
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:16,173
You can make a decision from there.

207
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:19,631
Can you really get rid of these little lines?

208
00:14:19,738 --> 00:14:21,080
In an hour.

209
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:26,953
To family.

210
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:47,896
I would--um,

211
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:51,792
we don't have that kind of supply at the moment.

212
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:57,677
Well, I'm glad you like it that incredible--

213
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,828
I don't think that'll be possible.

214
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:06,481
I'd love to sell you that many cases of La Premiere Vie serum, uh,

215
00:15:06,776 --> 00:15:08,975
we just don't have the inventory.

216
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:12,334
No, we're producing it as fast as we can.

217
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,639
Uh, what?

218
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:20,052
Fine, I'll send you as much as we have.

219
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:23,034
Sounds like you have rich people's problems.

220
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,742
I'm sorry. Uh, may I sit?

221
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:29,314
Thanks.

222
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:36,648
Well, you're busy, so I'll get right to it.

223
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,302
Sean and Christian were hesitant,

224
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:42,070
but I was always intrigued by your business proposal.

225
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:46,691
Hmm. Well, sean and Christian should've listened to you. The deal's off the table.

226
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:48,086
You should put it back on.

227
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,707
Hey, you've gotten some nice attention, but heat is fickle

228
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,049
and once you're not the fresh new girls on the block anymore,

229
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:57,334
you're gonna need some steady business. We can provide that.

230
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,165
Troy/Costa is family.

231
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,461
McNamara/Troy was family.

232
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:05,801
You guys are just another doctor's office now.

233
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:12,882
Let me take you out to dinner tomorrow night to prove to you that we're not.

234
00:16:13,762 --> 00:16:16,359
It will give us a chance to get to know each other.

235
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:22,033
Well, that sounds lovely, but I really don't have the time.

236
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:24,040
Well, there's always time for dinner.

237
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,029
Tell me that a cold glass of sauvignon blanc

238
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:33,613
and a plate of grilled oysters doesn't sound great right now.

239
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,201
It does, but I can barely keep my eyes open at night.

240
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:39,846
I'm in here at 6:00, I'm out by 9:30.

241
00:16:39,936 --> 00:16:42,380
Great. Then I'll make reservations for 9:45.

242
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:43,822
I know just the place.

243
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:53,384
A couple of botox shots around the eyes,

244
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:58,514
maybe a light peel, some restalin filler.

245
00:16:59,044 --> 00:17:03,851
All outpatient procedures. You'll lose ten years in an afternoon.

246
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:06,535
I certainly didn't get your nose.

247
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,968
No. You have your father's nose.

248
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:14,698
Tell me more about yourself.

249
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,774
Do you have any other children?

250
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:21,175
I have 2. Max is 18 and Sarah is 14.

251
00:17:22,947 --> 00:17:25,427
Sarah is a little doll.

252
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:29,038
She won't wear pants. Only boys wear pants.

253
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:32,682
And Max wants to be a marine biologist.

254
00:17:32,797 --> 00:17:35,471
He has this thing for sharks. Don't ask me where he got that.

255
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,938
I never go more than ankle deep in a swimming pool.

256
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,840
Is he enrolled at the university of Miami?

257
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:42,097
They have a great marine biology department.

258
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:44,416
I know, we're trying, but he has mild dyslexia,

259
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:48,489
so his grades are just so-so, and it's so competitive.

260
00:17:48,872 --> 00:17:51,000
They're such good kids.

261
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:57,062
They saved me. They brought me back from, you know, what happened.

262
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:02,157
I know some people in admissions. If there's anything I can do to help--

263
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:04,165
My kids don't know about you.

264
00:18:06,123 --> 00:18:10,684
There are some places inside you where children don't ever need to go.

265
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:14,302
Hi.

266
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:15,534
Hi.

267
00:18:15,906 --> 00:18:18,062
Aren't you going to introduce me?

268
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:25,872
Of course. This is my fiancee Kimber.

269
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,353
- Kimber, this is my--
- Gail.

270
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:29,461
- Hi.
- Hi.

271
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:31,377
Nice to meet you. These are for you.

272
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:33,834
Thank you.

273
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:35,017
You're welcome.

274
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:37,978
What are you doing here, sweetheart?

275
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:41,965
Honey, a girl doesn't pass up a chance to meet her mother-in-law.

276
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:44,701
I'm nervous. Sorry. I just--

277
00:18:44,835 --> 00:18:47,721
I think this gotta be the fourth outfit I've put on today.

278
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:48,923
It's lovely.

279
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:52,082
Thank you. I don't have a lot of family of my own,

280
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:55,892
so getting to know you is sort of special for both of us.

281
00:18:55,998 --> 00:18:58,950
It's really gonna pay off when we have kids of our own, you know?

282
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,031
Sweetheart, maybe you should go wait in my office.

283
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,702
Plus consultations are usually a private affair.

284
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:11,778
Ok. Of course.

285
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:17,816
Um, but, Gail, don't leave without giving Christian your address for the wedding invitation, ok?

286
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:18,905
When's the date?

287
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:20,275
To be determined.

288
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:23,192
We've only been engaged for a few weeks.

289
00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:25,836
Yeah, well, we've known each other forever.

290
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:28,352
Christian is the best, Gail.

291
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:32,043
He's generous and funny,

292
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,366
gorgeous, and successful.

293
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,289
Everything you would want in a husband and a son.

294
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:41,598
Gail has a son and a daughter.

295
00:19:41,837 --> 00:19:42,968
Really?

296
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,938
Maybe we should get together before the wedding.

297
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,948
I mean, your kids could be in our wedding party,

298
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:48,955
then you could walk Christian down the aisle.

299
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,690
That would be amazing, wouldn't it?

300
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,426
It was nice to meet you.

301
00:19:58,248 --> 00:19:59,146
Bye.

302
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:10,071
I'm sorry.

303
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,024
I told her I was seeing you today, but I didn't invite her.

304
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:18,964
She's very sweet.

305
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:21,655
Do you love her?

306
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,919
I think so. Yes.

307
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,663
Then you'll be fine.

308
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:32,876
Christian, this is really hard for me,

309
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:35,957
but I'm gonna give it my best shot, ok?

310
00:20:36,383 --> 00:20:40,042
Let's just take it one step at a time.

311
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:49,994
Keep them closed. No peeking.

312
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:55,390
All right, lay your eyes on the new Nikki and Austin Morretti,

313
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:57,461
or whatever it is they're going to call us.

314
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:03,284
Jersey Girl and Surfer Check. All it took was a bottle of peroxide.

315
00:21:03,757 --> 00:21:05,882
How do you like your new look, Austin?

316
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:09,501
Well, I like not looking like my dad.

317
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,319
Hello?

318
00:21:24,498 --> 00:21:25,862
Hello?

319
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:33,054
Who was that?

320
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,294
Nobody. Just a hang-up.

321
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,895
How often you get those?

322
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:40,281
I don't know. Not often.

323
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:41,917
Go get your shoes, Austin.

324
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:43,379
- But, mom--
- Just do it.

325
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,497
I need to borrow your car.

326
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,663
Nikki, it was just a hang-up.

327
00:21:49,754 --> 00:21:52,351
Well, that's how it starts, hang-ups, a new car outside your neighbor's house,

328
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:55,503
a feeling at the mall, little things.

329
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:56,539
Nobody knows you're here.

330
00:21:56,627 --> 00:22:00,269
That kind of thinking gets you killed. Please, Sean?

331
00:22:20,725 --> 00:22:22,139
Dr. Troy!

332
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,161
Tommy.

333
00:22:26,074 --> 00:22:27,005
What's this?

334
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:30,998
My brother and my sister, Evan and Aimee.

335
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,432
We wanted to talk to you about our brother's case.

336
00:22:33,524 --> 00:22:34,663
About the money.

337
00:22:43,198 --> 00:22:45,030
Aimee and I have some money saved up from work

338
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:47,162
and a little that our grandparents left us.

339
00:22:47,262 --> 00:22:49,539
We wanted to give it to you for Tommy's surgeries.

340
00:22:49,654 --> 00:22:51,750
To make up for what our parents are short.

341
00:22:52,491 --> 00:22:53,829
How much do you have?

342
00:22:53,918 --> 00:22:54,864
Around 15.

343
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:58,295
Please, Dr. Troy. This is so important to Tommy.

344
00:22:58,394 --> 00:23:01,145
His life is 2 things, running and family.

345
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:07,978
Tommy, you do realize that looking like your family isn't what makes you a part of it.

346
00:23:08,094 --> 00:23:09,495
Dr. Troy?

347
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:11,594
I got you something.

348
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:22,716
It's gold.

349
00:23:28,434 --> 00:23:29,975
Tommy, come here for a second.

350
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:36,028
Have you ever taken a good look at your brother and your sister's noses?

351
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,858
No. Why?

352
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:39,352
They have a pronounced bump.

353
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:42,173
We call it a nasal-dorsal protrusion.

354
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,044
Your father has one, too.

355
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:49,285
What do you say I get you one of those bumps? Huh?

356
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:51,360
A Bolton bump.

357
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,202
A Bolton bump?

358
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,282
It certainly is a family trait.

359
00:23:55,396 --> 00:23:57,300
A Bolton bump!

360
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:00,358
A Bolton bump!

361
00:24:00,597 --> 00:24:05,956
I never realized how much running a company is like being the patriarch of a family.

362
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:09,596
Everyone's depending on you for their mortgages

363
00:24:09,686 --> 00:24:13,233
and their kids' braces and their emotional validation.

364
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:17,190
My stress I can handle, it's everyone else's that's killing me.

365
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,239
See? This is exactly why you need us.

366
00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:23,996
We're a known commodity, professionally and personally.

367
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:27,631
I'm talking about guaranteeing our clientele for 3 years.

368
00:24:27,737 --> 00:24:30,316
Every patient leaving our offices will be going straight to yours,

369
00:24:30,412 --> 00:24:34,167
and all you have to do is pay us a small fee for the referral.

370
00:24:34,297 --> 00:24:36,949
Hell, you can even tack the cost onto their bill.

371
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:40,716
From what I hear, you don't have a lot of patients to refer.

372
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:44,240
All business is cyclical.

373
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:46,000
We'll come back.

374
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,053
Enough talk, let's dance.

375
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:54,154
- No, thanks.
- No?

376
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:05,064
My father died when I was thirteen.

377
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:08,791
I supported my mother and my brother all through high school and college.

378
00:25:08,892 --> 00:25:10,192
I still send them money.

379
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,898
I know what it's like to have people depending on you for everything.

380
00:25:16,944 --> 00:25:19,696
If there's one thing I've learned,

381
00:25:20,007 --> 00:25:22,695
it's that if you want to survive the pressure,

382
00:25:26,232 --> 00:25:28,247
you have to let steam off sometimes.

383
00:26:01,544 --> 00:26:03,561
You're amazing. Where did you learn to tango?

384
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,418
Sean and I took ballroom classes before our wedding.

385
00:26:12,936 --> 00:26:16,892
We were going to do this big tango salsa number for our first dance,

386
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:18,418
but he chickened out.

387
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:21,975
One more dance.

388
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:27,273
You're my ex-husband's business partner. I can't.

389
00:27:27,366 --> 00:27:29,845
Ex-husband, ex-partner.

390
00:27:30,004 --> 00:27:34,488
No strings here. Just 2 adult business people having a nice time.

391
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:51,948
Sorry I just need to grab my book.

392
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:54,062
Y-yeah.

393
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:05,886
Sean, I'm sorry about the way I acted today,

394
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:08,556
about the way I've been acting since we've been here.

395
00:28:08,661 --> 00:28:13,513
No, I'm sorry. I think I underestimated how hard this is on you.

396
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:15,020
I'm coming home.

397
00:28:15,191 --> 00:28:17,837
You're putting yourself back on the run.

398
00:28:18,568 --> 00:28:20,561
You're a good guy, Sean.

399
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:25,751
I never thought that I would trust a man again after what my husband did to us.

400
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:30,516
I certainly never thought that Austin would bond with a man again.

401
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:32,388
Do you really think he's bonding with me?

402
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:35,022
Are you kidding? I catch him staring at you.

403
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,592
I guess I never noticed.

404
00:28:38,307 --> 00:28:41,498
I've had a bad experience with the whole father-son thing.

405
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,186
I think I'm a little shut off to it.

406
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:48,462
Does every kid break their parents' hearts?

407
00:28:48,582 --> 00:28:50,110
Eventually.

408
00:28:50,788 --> 00:28:53,899
That's what families are for, breaking our hearts.

409
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:56,465
And helping us put them back together.

410
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:03,163
Do you want to stay?

411
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:05,772
No strings,

412
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,410
just not alone.

413
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:15,486
Not alone sounds great right now.

414
00:29:36,997 --> 00:29:38,817
So where did you go today?

415
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:44,944
I just took Austin to get a McDonald's.

416
00:29:46,007 --> 00:29:48,131
I needed some time to cool off.

417
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:50,895
Mom?

418
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:54,104
Yes, sweetheart, what is it?

419
00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:57,564
I had a nightmare.

420
00:29:57,988 --> 00:29:59,739
Can I sleep here with you guys?

421
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:04,369
Yeah. Of course, baby. Come on.

422
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:35,626
Hey.

423
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:38,975
Good morning.

424
00:30:40,986 --> 00:30:43,022
How did we get here?

425
00:30:43,131 --> 00:30:44,778
You invited me up.

426
00:30:44,898 --> 00:30:46,532
Oh, god.

427
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:51,838
Don't worry. We just passed out in front of a Jeffersons' repeat like an old married couple.

428
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:54,081
Ok? Are you all right?

429
00:30:54,448 --> 00:30:55,339
Here.

430
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,463
I have some french toast on the stove.

431
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:06,181
Um, no. I'm sorry. You're gonna have to leave before the kids wake up.

432
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,478
Too late.

433
00:31:08,982 --> 00:31:11,880
Uh, hi, Matt.

434
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,820
You want some french toast?

435
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:17,247
Wow, you're really making up for lost time.

436
00:31:17,331 --> 00:31:21,323
How many guys is that since you left dad? 4, 5?

437
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:26,484
In my house, boys got the strap for disrespecting their mothers.

438
00:31:26,576 --> 00:31:30,342
Well, screwing her doesn't make this your house.

439
00:31:30,365 --> 00:31:34,681
Just because Christian's getting married doesn't mean you have to go on a man bender, mom.

440
00:31:34,774 --> 00:31:36,358
Christian's getting married?

441
00:31:36,455 --> 00:31:37,522
To whom?

442
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:38,855
Kimber.

443
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:42,687
You know, the porn starlet who boned my other dad after you left him.

444
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:45,432
Did you nail her, too, before you moved on to my mom?

445
00:31:45,535 --> 00:31:50,832
Matt, stop it. Quentin and I had a meeting last night. It ran late. That's all.

446
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,986
Couldn't you have chosen a hump buddy who isn't one of dad's partners?

447
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:54,867
That's enough, Matt.

448
00:31:54,886 --> 00:31:56,593
Ok, you just shut your mouth.

449
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,495
Just because you operated on my face

450
00:31:58,581 --> 00:32:00,872
doesn't mean you get to tell me what to do,

451
00:32:00,974 --> 00:32:02,837
¿comprende, ese?

452
00:32:06,732 --> 00:32:07,632
You want me to go get him?

453
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:10,510
No, he'll be fine.

454
00:32:11,023 --> 00:32:14,632
I try not to have anyone around when the kids are here.

455
00:32:14,757 --> 00:32:17,507
Those mojitos really screwed with my head.

456
00:32:17,597 --> 00:32:20,013
Hey, are you kidding me?

457
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:23,451
You were a tiger shark at Manolo's last night.

458
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:25,286
You're a real type A.

459
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:33,614
I haven't had that much fun in a long time.

460
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:40,985
U.M. is the only university in Florida with its own deep-sea submersible,

461
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:45,511
and undergrads get to audit courses at the Rosenstein school.

462
00:32:45,654 --> 00:32:48,949
You don't have to sell me on this place, Dr. Troy. I'm dying to go here,

463
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:50,765
but I'm still waitlisted.

464
00:32:51,027 --> 00:32:54,905
I know. That's why I wanted to meet you.

465
00:32:55,669 --> 00:33:01,935
The administration likes influential alumni like myself to re-interview waitlisted students.

466
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,866
It's kind of like a final evaluation process.

467
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:06,466
I've never heard of that.

468
00:33:06,645 --> 00:33:08,613
We like to keep it on the Q.T.,

469
00:33:08,716 --> 00:33:13,086
otherwise parents of waitlisted students will be sending me Hermes throws just to curry favor.

470
00:33:13,185 --> 00:33:16,501
That's exactly what my mom would have done, even if she couldn't afford it.

471
00:33:16,707 --> 00:33:18,153
Is that right?

472
00:33:19,856 --> 00:33:21,203
Tell me about your mother.

473
00:33:21,315 --> 00:33:22,930
About your whole family.

474
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:26,034
My mom is the best.

475
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:29,257
I mean, everyone says that, but I'm pretty sure I'm right.

476
00:33:29,362 --> 00:33:30,887
She's a midwife, you know.

477
00:33:32,163 --> 00:33:33,847
No, I didn't know that.

478
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,933
I've been to one of her births. It was wild.

479
00:33:37,336 --> 00:33:39,973
This woman was screaming holy hell,

480
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:42,987
and my mom took her hand and sang a lullaby,

481
00:33:43,157 --> 00:33:45,209
and the screaming just stopped.

482
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:50,761
It was like my mom was taking all the pain and hiding it away somewhere.

483
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:55,825
She used to do the same thing for us when we were kids and got hurt or had a bad day but...

484
00:33:56,023 --> 00:33:57,148
I don't know, man.

485
00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:58,573
It's like magic.

486
00:33:59,598 --> 00:34:00,663
It must be amazing.

487
00:34:00,768 --> 00:34:01,853
It is.

488
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:04,504
I worry though.

489
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,712
Sometimes after a really hard birth, she locks herself in her bedroom,

490
00:34:08,802 --> 00:34:11,431
and I can hear her sobbing, like it all hurts too much.

491
00:34:12,606 --> 00:34:14,717
What do you do then?

492
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,365
I usually make her some chocolate milk.

493
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:21,093
I'm the only one that can really make her feel better when she's like that.

494
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:23,631
We have a bond, you know, firstborn and all.

495
00:34:24,718 --> 00:34:26,611
What's your mom like, Dr. Troy?

496
00:34:26,994 --> 00:34:28,241
The same.

497
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:36,115
I think the university of Miami could use a guy like you, Max.

498
00:34:36,985 --> 00:34:38,384
Are you serious?

499
00:34:38,482 --> 00:34:41,764
As soon as I call the admissions office, it should be a done deal,

500
00:34:41,971 --> 00:34:44,257
that is if you still want to come here.

501
00:34:44,377 --> 00:34:46,250
Yeah. Thank you.

502
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:48,598
I can't believe this.

503
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:50,383
Believe it.

504
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:52,895
Go tell your mom.

505
00:34:53,112 --> 00:34:58,194
All right. Wait, you have to come to my graduation party this friday.

506
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:02,397
Are you sure that's a good idea? I mean, shouldn't you ask your parents first?

507
00:35:02,497 --> 00:35:04,986
Are you kidding me? They're going to treat you like a king.

508
00:35:05,111 --> 00:35:08,288
Sure, I'll be there.

509
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:09,776
All right.

510
00:35:17,006 --> 00:35:18,500
Look pretty good, huh?

511
00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:20,567
The oven.

512
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:24,507
And...

513
00:35:25,343 --> 00:35:26,491
voila.

514
00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:31,891
It's ok. It's just Matt.

515
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:34,823
Hey, dad.

516
00:35:35,687 --> 00:35:37,200
It's a nice apron.

517
00:35:37,575 --> 00:35:39,816
Nose is healing nicely.

518
00:35:39,948 --> 00:35:41,771
Are you breathing freely, no blockage?

519
00:35:41,897 --> 00:35:43,382
No. It's fine.

520
00:35:43,939 --> 00:35:45,308
Who's this?

521
00:35:46,046 --> 00:35:49,819
Matt, this is my friend Nikki and her son Austin.

522
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:52,203
They're staying with me for a little while.

523
00:35:56,992 --> 00:35:59,861
Austin, why don't we go get washed up?

524
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:11,927
Since when do you bake?

525
00:36:12,012 --> 00:36:14,789
Nikki and Austin have been going through a tough time.

526
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:17,084
I was just trying to make them feel at home.

527
00:36:17,193 --> 00:36:18,840
It's actually nice having them here.

528
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:21,420
The house was feeling empty with everyone at your mother's.

529
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:26,479
Well, it's a little crowded over there. Your ex-partner slept over last night.

530
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:27,648
Christian?

531
00:36:27,772 --> 00:36:30,945
No, the other guy, Quentin.

532
00:36:32,265 --> 00:36:35,632
Your mother's her own woman now.

533
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:38,948
Don't tell me you don't have any feelings about any of this.

534
00:36:39,003 --> 00:36:40,759
Look, if you have an issue with who she's dating,

535
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,930
it's your responsibility to talk to her about it.

536
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:45,699
- She's not my problem anymore.
- Yeah. Why should she be?

537
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:48,428
Seeing as how you seem to have found a suitable replacement for all of us.

538
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,235
I wouldn't have needed replacements if you hadn't deserted me.

539
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,593
I haven't seen you for weeks.

540
00:36:53,718 --> 00:36:55,808
I never stopped trying with you or your mother, Matt.

541
00:36:55,903 --> 00:36:59,648
You don't get a medal for trying, man. You were our dad. Ok?

542
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:01,395
That was your job.

543
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:05,546
Why are you screaming and being such a jerk? It's not cool.

544
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:08,963
I'm sorry. He's a little sensitive to yelling.

545
00:37:11,034 --> 00:37:13,246
That's good.

546
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:52,456
Looking good so far.

547
00:39:03,025 --> 00:39:05,825
There's some swelling and some bruising, but

548
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:08,207
that should go away in about a week.

549
00:39:12,274 --> 00:39:13,705
Oh, my god.

550
00:39:16,072 --> 00:39:18,327
I look like my dad.

551
00:39:27,578 --> 00:39:29,991
Congratulations, Mrs. Weiss.

552
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:36,316
You are the first Troy/Costa-De La Mer dual patient under our new exclusive contract.

553
00:39:36,494 --> 00:39:37,763
Please enjoy your stay.

554
00:39:42,843 --> 00:39:46,476
It's a beginning of a beautiful friendship.

555
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,470
Let's celebrate.

556
00:39:48,655 --> 00:39:50,121
I don't know, Quentin.

557
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:51,819
This is a dangerous road.

558
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:54,494
Sean and Christian aren't gonna like us seeing each other.

559
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,913
It's time for you to stop caring about what they think.

560
00:39:57,034 --> 00:39:58,701
That part of your life is over.

561
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,859
Julia, this place is a fresh start.

562
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:05,657
Don't blow it by holding on to old baggage.

563
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:13,547
Fine, but no more dancing. My thighs are still killing me.

564
00:40:14,404 --> 00:40:15,274
Deal.

565
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,147
Dr. McNamara.

566
00:40:31,698 --> 00:40:32,994
Are they here?

567
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:34,296
No.

568
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:36,843
They went to the beach for the day.

569
00:40:37,781 --> 00:40:39,901
You shouldn't have brought them here, doctor.

570
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:44,246
You put all 3 of you and our work at risk.

571
00:40:44,352 --> 00:40:45,703
They're not prisoners.

572
00:40:45,862 --> 00:40:47,464
She's already testified.

573
00:40:47,635 --> 00:40:50,908
Who cares where she spends her last few days before she's sent off into the abyss?

574
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:52,529
You should,

575
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:57,271
and if you'd bothered to look further than where your dick reaches,

576
00:40:57,365 --> 00:41:02,666
you'd see that the woman you so casually invited into your home is not what she seems.

577
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:06,241
What she seems to be is someone who's doing everything she can keep her family together

578
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,549
under unthinkable pressures since her husband was--

579
00:41:08,648 --> 00:41:14,220
Mrs. Morretti's husband wasn't killed because he was talking to us.

580
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:17,979
She killed him because he found out she was.

581
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:20,226
We've invested enough in her to give her immunity,

582
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:24,916
but this is not the victim of an unfortunate marital circumstance.

583
00:41:25,023 --> 00:41:30,545
This is a woman who bought a gun, got her husband drunk on cheap chianti,

584
00:41:30,682 --> 00:41:32,654
and blew his head off.

585
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:43,061
I can't make you send them back to me,

586
00:41:43,225 --> 00:41:46,705
but for your safety and the safety of your real family,

587
00:41:47,442 --> 00:41:49,623
I'd recommend you do so.

588
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:09,901
Hey.

589
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:17,143
Aren't you going to invite me in? I'm kind of responsible for the celebration.

590
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:22,296
Look, um, I'm very grateful for what you did for Max.

591
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:27,319
He's over the moon, but you shouldn't have done that, Christian,

592
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,675
not without checking with me first.

593
00:42:29,786 --> 00:42:33,039
I know. I wanted to surprise you.

594
00:42:36,403 --> 00:42:38,442
Look, Christian,

595
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:43,042
I thought I could do this, you and me.

596
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:49,866
There's times when I look at you or I hear your voice, and I feel like you are a part of me,

597
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:51,723
just like my other kids.

598
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,068
That's all I want,

599
00:42:53,468 --> 00:42:55,769
just to be a part of your family.

600
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:59,270
But when Max came home and told me about this nice man

601
00:42:59,364 --> 00:43:01,479
who helped him get into college,

602
00:43:02,576 --> 00:43:08,448
I just felt sick to my stomach.

603
00:43:11,736 --> 00:43:16,471
I grew up in foster homes with nothing.

604
00:43:18,748 --> 00:43:24,159
Now I have a life. I have a fiancee, friends, a business.

605
00:43:24,277 --> 00:43:26,829
You can get through anything if you want to.

606
00:43:26,947 --> 00:43:31,758
Not if you have a living reminder of your pain coming over for dinner every friday night.

607
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:35,581
I've worked hard to build walls around my family

608
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:41,871
so that none of that ugliness that your father did to me would ever get in and stain us.

609
00:43:43,033 --> 00:43:45,950
Is that what I am to you, a stain?

610
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:47,230
No.

611
00:43:52,392 --> 00:43:53,954
You're my son,

612
00:43:56,171 --> 00:43:58,662
but I can't be your mother.

613
00:44:05,202 --> 00:44:06,617
Goodbye, Christian.

614
00:44:52,302 --> 00:44:55,717
