00:00:00,816 --> 00:00:02,168
<i>Previously on</i> Nip/Tuck.

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,253
You really should lock up
your firearms

3
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,476
and not leave them
in a bedside table drawer,

4
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:08,133
you stupid bitch.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,054
We're still married?

6
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:15,181
We're still married.

7
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:17,581
And we have 3 beautiful children.

8
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,814
Everything is just...

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,410
perfect.

10
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:25,691
I can't walk. It's hard.

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,710
- So is stage two breast cancer.
- What does breast cancer have to do

12
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:30,855
- with anything?
- I have it.

13
00:00:34,543 --> 00:00:35,534
Don't fight it.

14
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:38,408
It's less painful that way.

15
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:43,891
- Yeah?
- Can you stay a while?

16
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:47,114
Just until I fall asleep.

17
00:00:51,144 --> 00:00:53,571
You and Dr. Christian Troy
had sexual intercourse.

18
00:00:53,696 --> 00:00:56,278
- You and Liz had sex?
- Yeah. Lizzie was there for me.

19
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:58,349
She spread her legs
and made me feel good.

20
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,851
- You were awake?
- Got my mojo back.

21
00:01:01,157 --> 00:01:04,024
I knew that you weren't sleeping,
and I faked my orgasm,

22
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:06,453
and you are a lousy lay!

23
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:10,820
- Come on, I have an image to protect.
- I'm sorry, I have no idea who you are.

24
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:14,365
I'm a goddamn icon.

25
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,825
Tell him who I am.

26
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,244
- Candy richards?
- Damn straight.

27
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:25,418
Tell us what you don't like
about yourself now, Ms. Richards.

28
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:30,066
I don't go by Candy Richards
no more.

29
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,779
That name was given to me
by a white man.

30
00:01:32,904 --> 00:01:34,260
My name is Coco.

31
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,552
I'm an african american,

32
00:01:36,677 --> 00:01:39,892
and I've been passing
as a honky white cracker

33
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,632
- for my entire life.
- - What?

34
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:45,855
Yeah, my agent Maury gave me
this thing for christmas.

35
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,616
It was like
a genetics D.N.A. gift set.

36
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:52,570
I found out
that I'm african in nature.

37
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,782
All my life I've wondered
why my career isn't bigger.

38
00:01:57,332 --> 00:01:59,808
Is it because I'm too beautiful?

39
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:03,497
- Or is it because I'm too smart?
- Not talented?

40
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,273
I thought that, too,

41
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:08,544
but now it all makes sense.

42
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:12,298
I love billy ocean,
I love chicken and waffles,

43
00:02:12,778 --> 00:02:14,845
and always
I've been one of those people

44
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,720
that I always know deep in my heart
that O.J. was innocent.

45
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:21,105
I'm a black daughter of slavery
with...

46
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,379
with blood from the zulu nation.

47
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:26,479
You still haven't told us
why you're here.

48
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,308
I want
some african american features.

49
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:32,276
I have the chest, you know,
which is, proof of my heritage.

50
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:34,931
What I want is a big,

51
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:37,515
fat, round beyonce ass.

52
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:41,918
And I need it fast because
my hip-hop album's gonna drop soon,

53
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:45,994
and I need to get some more junk
in the trunk before I do my big video.

54
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,039
- Ms. Richards...
- Coco!

55
00:02:48,164 --> 00:02:50,069
Coco, this is insane.

56
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,648
It has nothing to do with affirming

57
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,841
your african american heritage.
You're doing it to become a star.

58
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,802
Pita potato, french fry.

59
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,391
Look, what you're asking for
is one step away

60
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:03,246
from putting shoe polish on your face
and singingmami.

61
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:05,562
- It's highly offensive.
- You know, you guys,

62
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:09,058
you do ass implants,
you do collagen injections,

63
00:03:09,183 --> 00:03:12,625
but yet you guys would like
to send me to the back of the bus

64
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,861
when I don't want to have
your white version of beauty.

65
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,255
Shame on you.

66
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:22,614
- What's the harm, really?
- I can tell you what the harm is.

67
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,996
The harm is me not achieving
my destiny.

68
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:31,441
I want my goddamn reparations.

69
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,818
We have an opening thursday morning.

70
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:41,291
All right. Solid.

71
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,776
Synchro: guig

72
00:04:48,745 --> 00:04:50,850
It's a breast cancer support group.

73
00:04:50,975 --> 00:04:53,223
"Join us as we learn
to embrace our new bodies,

74
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:54,995
"love them as they are now,

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,867
"not as we wish them to be."

76
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:59,384
It'll be good for you to be
around people who are going through

77
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:02,335
- what you're going through.
- One-titted soccer moms.

78
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,700
Thanks, buddy boy,
but it's not for me.

79
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:08,473
Seriously, you need to do something
to deal with your fear about all this.

80
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,643
I'm not scared, I'm angry.

81
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,977
Same thing.

82
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,397
All right,
maybe I'll take a look at it.

83
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:23,988
It's chilly in here.

84
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:29,453
This is why I don't have sex
with friends.

85
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,108
I'd rather bang
somebody I don't like.

86
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,958
I lied.

87
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:37,378
I came. You were right,

88
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,781
I had an orgasm.
I had a big, fat, juicy,

89
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:42,383
bone rattling orgasm.

90
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:44,260
- Happy?
- Yeah.

91
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:46,178
You know, I wasn't even trying.

92
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:47,996
You don't get it, do you?

93
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,990
When I was 21,

94
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:51,831
I discovered I was a lesbian.

95
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:53,836
It was my independence day.

96
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:58,048
I finally understood
who I was supposed to be.

97
00:05:58,303 --> 00:06:00,906
Now, you decide to get
your rocks off one night

98
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:03,574
- and I don't know up from down.
- Christ.

99
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,678
- You in love with me?
- What?!

100
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:07,005


101
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:10,231
This is larger than your ego,
Christian.

102
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:13,440
I have spent 20 years

103
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:16,709
dreaming of finding the woman
who would share my life with me.

104
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:18,462
- And now?
- Now?

105
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,974
I don't know
if a woman could satisfy me.

106
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:23,081
No one ever has, not like that.

107
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:24,932
You know, you're over thinking this.

108
00:06:25,057 --> 00:06:27,661
My cock has mystical powers,
that's all.

109
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,921
- It'll pass.
- It'll pass?

110
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:33,721
I can't sleep. I'm distracted.
I caught myself checking out a...

111
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:36,056
a muscle magazine at a newsstand.

112
00:06:37,556 --> 00:06:39,179
You know what we need to do?

113
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:41,900
- We need to have sex again.
- I would rather die.

114
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:45,055
Me, too, but we need to know
if this is a one time thing.

115
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,072
If you don't have
a seismic event again,

116
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,167
then you'll know you were destined
to clap clams for the rest of your life.

117
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:54,475
You know, most people who have had
traumatic life experiences,

118
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,251
they gain sensitivity,

119
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:58,064
but no, not you.

120
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,753
I know your destiny, Christian.

121
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:03,487
You are destined to die alone.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,152
Anything else?

123
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:15,604
My eyes.

124
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:18,529
I've got these awful bags now.

125
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,253
That's because you haven't slept,
honey.

126
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:22,903
You just need to rest.

127
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:25,611
Oh, and my lips.
They're so thin and pale.

128
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:29,364
And that's because of your diet,
Even you said so.

129
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:31,950
I look like I've aged 10 years
in the last 6 months,

130
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,458
and I know you can tell.

131
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,538
Between taking care of you
and watching Eden move to europe

132
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:38,989
to do those awful movies, I just...

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,783
don't feel like myself anymore.

134
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:45,848
I... I want to look younger,

135
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:49,009
more hopeful.
Like I did when we met.

136
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:54,473
Can you please tell her
how ridiculous she's being?

137
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:58,176
She doesn't need all this work done.
And what about the risks involved?

138
00:07:58,301 --> 00:07:59,959
As I recall, she's quite up

139
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:02,847
on the adverse effects
of western medicine.

140
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:05,651
Specifically its crude approach

141
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:08,074
versus your eastern techniques.

142
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,164
Was that about what you said?

143
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:13,377
I'm curious to know
why you're so open to it now.

144
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:15,887
Well, it saved Julia's life.

145
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:18,247
How can I still deny the benefits?

146
00:08:19,984 --> 00:08:22,790
Did we talk
about liposuction for my thighs?

147
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:24,586
I'll be in the waiting room.

148
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:34,977
You two seem...

149
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:38,050
very happy together.

150
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,370
Yeah, in a weird way,

151
00:08:40,495 --> 00:08:43,480
with everything that's happened,
it's somehow brought us closer.

152
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:46,432
I can't imagine being
without her now.

153
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:48,611
And with all of this work,

154
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:51,002
it'll give us a fresh start.

155
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,907
That's kind of what
New York's about, too.

156
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:56,143
New York?

157
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,480
I accepted a position
at N.Y.U's teaching hospital.

158
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:01,986
We're moving back in 3 weeks.

159
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:08,834
When were you gonna tell me? New York?
You're planning to leave in 3 weeks

160
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,036
- and take Connor and annie with you?
- She wasn't supposed to tell you.

161
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:14,679
How long were you going
to hide it from me?

162
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,721
This from a man who fooled everyone
into thinking he was a cripple?

163
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,893
Why are you so upset?

164
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:24,066
It's not like
anything's changed between us.

165
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,080
Yeah. You're right.

166
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:34,907
Nothing ever changed for me,
Julia. I still love you.

167
00:09:35,422 --> 00:09:37,281
I hate not being with you
and our family.

168
00:09:37,406 --> 00:09:40,619
That's why I said those things to you
in the hospital.

169
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:42,741
Sean, stop it, please.

170
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:45,375
No, I won't stop.
Not till we're together again.

171
00:09:51,593 --> 00:09:53,026
Sean,

172
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:55,928
were you able to fit me in?

173
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,630
I never thought I'd be scared
of a dressing room at loehmann's.

174
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:05,596
I just felt everyone staring.

175
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:10,330
First I thought it was all in my head,
but then I noticed my...

176
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:13,333
pretend breast
had traveled up to my shoulder.

177
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:15,995
It looked like a corsage.

178
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:18,896
I was so humiliated.

179
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:22,637
It helps to know that I'm not alone.

180
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:25,071
We're all here for you, Lauren.

181
00:10:25,686 --> 00:10:28,866
Acceptance is
part of the grieving process.

182
00:10:29,558 --> 00:10:31,071
You've had a loss.

183
00:10:31,604 --> 00:10:34,174
But what if you're not the one
having trouble accepting?

184
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:38,002
I mean, I just always thought that jack
and I could get through anything,

185
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:41,354
but ever since he's seen my scar,
he won't even touch me.

186
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:42,849
Son of a bitch.

187
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,377
Give him time. I mean,
my husband freaked at first.

188
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:49,776
And now he actually finds
the scar kind of sexy.

189
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:52,317
He's lying.

190
00:10:54,482 --> 00:10:56,430
He's probably got
some hot double-breasted chick

191
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,519
- he's banging on the side.
- That is an awful thing to say.

192
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:01,211
Oh, come on, wake up.

193
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:04,084
You think any guy wants to run
his tongue along some misshapen gash

194
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:06,628
- instead of some hot pair of titties.
- Excuse me,

195
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:09,741
but this is a support group, Mr....

196
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,919
Doctor

197
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,757
Troy, plastic surgeon

198
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,864
and breast cancer patient.

199
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:16,634
Well, doctor,

200
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,000
this is obviously
the wrong place for you.

201
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,096
Why's that?

202
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:25,668
I know what it's like to look
in the mirror and see my mutilated body.

203
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:27,784
But damned
if I'm going to accept it.

204
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:31,813
You need to take charge of your destiny
and get some goddamn reconstruction.

205
00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:34,327
- That's a choice.
- Sweetheart,

206
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:37,507
I've been stuffing healthy tits
with implants for 20 years.

207
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:40,605
Any woman who chooses disfigurement
chooses

208
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:42,264
to be a victim.

209
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,676
This is a cancer survivor's group,
Roxy.

210
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:55,339
If you have to smoke, do it outside.

211
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:00,432
Okie dokie.

212
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,723
There's enough smoke being blown
in here anyway.

213
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:16,758
Any of you ladies want support,

214
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,109
just...

215
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:22,115
call my office
and make an appointment.

216
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:38,116
Want one?

217
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:41,259
I'm not one for mixing
my nicotine with my tomoxophin.

218
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:43,295
I like my poisons one at a time.

219
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,588
Suit yourself.

220
00:12:47,055 --> 00:12:49,482
Are you checking me out,
or trying to decide which one is real?

221
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:51,762
- They're both real.
- Good eye.

222
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,300
Nice rack.

223
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:58,937
So tell me, what's a girl
with a complete set doing playing

224
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,196
in a victims anonymous sandbox?

225
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,614
My mother and sister both died
from the disease.

226
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,818
I thought
that being around survivors

227
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,500
or people going through it themselves
would be therapeutic.

228
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,352
- And?
- Not so much, it turns out.

229
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:21,378
What you said in there
about taking charge of your own destiny,

230
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:22,547
I liked it.

231
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,538
You look like a woman
who likes to take charge.

232
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:27,797
So what do you think it is?

233
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,683
Your destiny, I mean.

234
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,488
To bang
as many beautiful women as I can.

235
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:36,092
So, doctor...

236
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:40,303
do I make the cut?

237
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:03,953
I have to go to those groups
more often.

238
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,236
Thanks for the support.

239
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,248
You must be one hell of a surgeon.

240
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,000
You've got very sensitive hands.

241
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,628
You have a very... responsive body.

242
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,964
Particularly here.

243
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:30,160
And...

244
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,291
here.

245
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,890
Yeah.

246
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:45,565
I'm probably going to miss feeling
that once the girls are gone.

247
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,783
What?

248
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,311
What are you talking about?

249
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:56,681
Those are 2 of the healthiest tits
I've ever put my dick between.

250
00:14:56,806 --> 00:15:00,299
I'm not going to be the third person
in my family to die of breast cancer.

251
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:02,400
You tested positive for brca1?

252
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:04,776
No.

253
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,019
That doesn't mean I don't have it.

254
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:11,996
I know the statistics.

255
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:16,092
Removing both breasts
cuts the risk by 90%.

256
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:18,416
But if there's no abnormality
in the gene...

257
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,252
I don't give a shit about the test.

258
00:15:21,084 --> 00:15:22,944
I know I'm going to get it.

259
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,730
It's only a matter of time.

260
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,601
Do you have any idea
what it's like to wake up in the morning

261
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,835
scared to take a shower,
terrified that...

262
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:43,313
today will be the day
that I find that lump?

263
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:46,717
I...

264
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,923
can't think about marriage,

265
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,936
can't think about kids.

266
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,104
I mean, what's the point?
I'm just going...

267
00:15:57,488 --> 00:16:00,085
to leave them,
just like my mother left me.

268
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:13,179
I want you to cut them off
and replace them.

269
00:16:20,785 --> 00:16:22,489
Who's got this nutjob's implants?

270
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,691
She's gonna look like
she's got 36ds in her ass.

271
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,821
Should we play Coco's demo?
She asked for it.

272
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:30,196
Whatever. Hit it.

273
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:49,291
You ready for tomorrow?

274
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:51,812
Just trying to get a preview.

275
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:54,697
Come, sit.

276
00:18:55,311 --> 00:18:58,192
Before we do a surgery,
I like to do a run-through.

277
00:18:58,317 --> 00:19:00,606
Look over the road map, so to speak.

278
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,949
Do you have the name of someone
in New York

279
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:05,435
I can call to do
the follow-up after the surgery?

280
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,936
Absolutely. Me.

281
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:09,564
I plan on being out there every weekend
from now on.

282
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:13,438
- You what?
- Those are my kids.

283
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:14,973
I'm their father.

284
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:18,031
I'm not going to leave them for you
to co-parent, especially after

285
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,266
the bang-up job you did
with your daughter.

286
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:21,773
Turn to the side.

287
00:19:22,624 --> 00:19:25,288
You're not worried
about my parenting, Sean.

288
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:28,111
You...
you just want to stay close to Julia.

289
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,815
God, if... if you really love her,

290
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,808
just let her go this time, for good.

291
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:38,844
- I could say the same thing to you.
- But I did let her go, Sean.

292
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,448
And you know what,
she came back to me.

293
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:44,956
Can't you just accept that Julia
and I are together for good now,

294
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:46,246
wish us well?

295
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:49,649


296
00:19:51,497 --> 00:19:54,173
Then how can I trust you to do
my facelift?

297
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,816
I never let my personal life interfere
with my professional obligations.

298
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:21,226
I'd feel a whole lot more comfortable
if she would have gone to a shrink

299
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:24,333
and processed some of this
before doing something so irrevocable.

300
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,872
It's her body, Lizzie.

301
00:20:25,997 --> 00:20:29,519
You can't just be pro-choice
when you agree with that choice.

302
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:31,142
Look,

303
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:34,165
- she's afraid, I understand.
- Do you?

304
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,347
Do you know
what it's like to lay awake at night

305
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:38,685
and wonder if you're going to be dead
within a year?

306
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:42,465
To look at your kid and try to memorize
what he looks like right now?

307
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,308
Or what it's like to hold
his hand right now?

308
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:48,295
Are we talking
about saving her life or yours?

309
00:20:49,368 --> 00:20:51,581
You can't cut the fear out of you

310
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:53,932
by taking off her breasts.

311
00:20:55,915 --> 00:20:56,915
15 blade.

312
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:12,757
I was dreaming.

313
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:20,194
I was running in a field...

314
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:22,376
with a child.

315
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,241
Maybe it was mine.

316
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:28,493
- I felt so carefree.
- Look, Roxy.

317
00:21:29,211 --> 00:21:31,164
I thought it would hurt more.

318
00:21:33,143 --> 00:21:34,196
I'm sorry.

319
00:21:47,344 --> 00:21:49,098
You promised me you'd do it.

320
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:53,693
- I thought you understood.
- I do. I understand that you're afraid,

321
00:21:53,818 --> 00:21:57,171
but you can't let fear
dictate something as big as this,

322
00:21:57,296 --> 00:22:00,485
particularly if there's a chance,
a good chance, that you might be fine.

323
00:22:01,772 --> 00:22:02,772
Fine?

324
00:22:04,872 --> 00:22:06,922
I have been condemned to death,

325
00:22:08,512 --> 00:22:10,787
and there aren't going to be
any pardons.

326
00:22:30,002 --> 00:22:32,557
Jesus, Christian,
this is a doctor's office.

327
00:22:33,995 --> 00:22:36,467
That's why I wrote myself
a prescription.

328
00:22:37,112 --> 00:22:40,025
You have any idea
how good this government shit is?

329
00:22:41,746 --> 00:22:43,320
Pass me Mr. Bubbles.

330
00:22:55,819 --> 00:22:57,608
Why are you so dressed up?

331
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:05,174
What do you think?
I was going for old hollywood glam.

332
00:23:05,682 --> 00:23:07,683
You look great. What's her name?

333
00:23:09,065 --> 00:23:10,831
- Steven.
- Butchy.

334
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,007
He's an anesthesiologist,

335
00:23:13,132 --> 00:23:16,963
and I met him at an IARS conference
just a little bit ago. And...

336
00:23:17,192 --> 00:23:18,604
he has been very persistent.

337
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,781
Well, let me give you
a word of advice, Lizzie.

338
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:23,663
Nobody can give it to you
the same way that I did.

339
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:26,322
OK? So, stop shaving your armpits

340
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:29,846
and get back to your sloppy gap
pullovers and your hicima salad.

341
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:32,290
- You're wasting your time!
<i>- Liz.</i>

342
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:50,446
Steven Elsbury,
this is Christian Troy.

343
00:23:52,746 --> 00:23:55,307
- Want some?
- No thanks. Never touch it.

344
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:03,020
- You look amazing.
- Well, thank you.

345
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
So...

346
00:24:06,063 --> 00:24:08,695
what do you 2 lovebirds
got on tap for this evening?

347
00:24:09,372 --> 00:24:13,347
Well, I made a reservation for Dolce,
but it's such a scene.

348
00:24:13,472 --> 00:24:16,214
Now, I just got a batch
of movies in from Netflix.

349
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:18,525
We could order in, talk.

350
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,529
Mmm. That sounds fantastic.

351
00:24:20,654 --> 00:24:21,904
Great. Great.

352
00:24:34,545 --> 00:24:36,418
You might want to open up a window.

353
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:39,268
I followed the smell
all the way from the lobby.

354
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,021
She's a lesbian.

355
00:24:48,444 --> 00:24:51,408
Am I the only one who thinks
that getting a facelift

356
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:53,935
when you run a holistic healing practice
is just a

357
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,783
teensy bit hypocritical?

358
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:57,931
It has nothing to
do with her career.

359
00:24:58,056 --> 00:25:01,582
She's insecure about Julia.
She knows she's on shaky ground.

360
00:25:01,854 --> 00:25:04,284
Then why are they both moving
to New York together?

361
00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:06,426
The further away she takes Julia,

362
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:09,496
the more she'll be able
to control their relationship,

363
00:25:09,772 --> 00:25:11,722
what she remembers, and who.

364
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:15,631
Julia's in no shape
to be making life decisions.

365
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,105
Olivia's taking advantage
of her vulnerability.

366
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:24,789
Poor Sean. You really think
she'll come back to you,

367
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:29,197
that you've got some deep bond
that time and space can't separate.

368
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,789
When are you going to
get it? She doesn't want you.

369
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:36,491
Once she remembers who we were to
each other, the life we had together...

370
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,371
all she remembers of her marriage
to you was that it was a failure.

371
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:42,998
She knows how deep
my commitment to her was.

372
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:46,209
Really? Like when she was sick
and you were banging my daughter?

373
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,470
- Shut the hell up.
- Kill me, why don't you?

374
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:50,297
You'd like to, wouldn't you?

375
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,598
Your life would be so much easier
if I wasn't in the way.

376
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:55,510
Don't tempt me, Olivia.

377
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:57,721
You'll never kill me, Sean.

378
00:25:57,846 --> 00:26:00,757
I'm in Julia's head.
I'm in her heart.

379
00:26:00,882 --> 00:26:02,095
I said shut up.

380
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,602
Sean, she's in VTAC.

381
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,688
- Her rate's 150.
- Get the defibrillator.

382
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:08,208
Charging paddles.

383
00:26:11,497 --> 00:26:13,624
I'm going to shock her on 3. Ready?

384
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:15,615
One, two, three.

385
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:19,883
- She's in arrest.
- I'm starting CPR. Call 911.

386
00:26:30,597 --> 00:26:31,597
How is she?

387
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:33,162
Stabilized.

388
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,230
Sean's with Julia at the hospital,
and he said he'd call when he knew more.

389
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,905
- I don't understand how this happened.
- She'll be fine, lizzie.

390
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,520
Besides, you did everything by the book.
She'd be dead if it wasn't for you.

391
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,985
Remember that.

392
00:26:50,846 --> 00:26:51,846
Now what?

393
00:26:51,971 --> 00:26:53,062
Now what?

394
00:26:54,908 --> 00:26:56,058
Now, we wait.

395
00:26:57,273 --> 00:26:58,541
You like sports?

396
00:27:08,234 --> 00:27:09,234
Hello.

397
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:11,203
Is Dr. Troy in?

398
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:14,021
- Do you have an appointment?
- No, no. I'm a friend.

399
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:15,913
He's finishing up
a consult right now,

400
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:18,085
but he usually checks back in
when it's done.

401
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,727
Do you have an outlet?

402
00:27:22,618 --> 00:27:24,475
How was your date with Evan?

403
00:27:25,123 --> 00:27:26,918
- Steven.
- Whatever.

404
00:27:28,784 --> 00:27:29,975
It was a dream.

405
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:35,033
He ordered pizza,
we watched <i>3 Days of the Condor</i>,

406
00:27:35,158 --> 00:27:37,208
and then, he made me dessert.

407
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:40,551
There is no greater
foreplay than flambé.

408
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:43,668
Did he make you cum?

409
00:27:44,351 --> 00:27:47,845
Yeah. He's got mystical powers, too.

410
00:27:53,322 --> 00:27:56,107
I think it would be
better if you sat over there.

411
00:29:12,803 --> 00:29:14,307
Why Olivia, Sean?

412
00:29:14,642 --> 00:29:16,429
In all this time
you've been operating,

413
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,483
you've always been so careful
and so thorough.

414
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:23,516
Now, isn't it just possible that you
weren't careful with her because

415
00:29:23,993 --> 00:29:26,765
somewhere in
that dark soul of yours,

416
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,431
you just wanted to be rid of her?

417
00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:31,106
Are you blaming me?

418
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:33,230
I can't believe you said that.

419
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,357
You lied about the wheelchair. You lied
about Monica. You lied about Megan.

420
00:29:36,802 --> 00:29:38,531
You're a liar and a cheater.

421
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:45,556
Are you Dr. Mcnamara,
Ms. Lord's physician?

422
00:29:45,681 --> 00:29:46,981
How's she doing?

423
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,247
I'm afraid we weren't
able to save her.

424
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,222
Her heart stopped at 5:03.

425
00:29:55,573 --> 00:29:56,741
Oh, my god.

426
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:01,180
I want to see her.
You have to let me see her.

427
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:04,686
- I'm sorry. Who are you?
- I'm her partner, god damn it.

428
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:07,987
Of course. If you'll just
wait a few minutes.

429
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,167
I will never forgive you, Sean.

430
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:16,222
Now, there is going
to be an autopsy,

431
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,441
and if you have any culpability at all,
it will be revealed,

432
00:30:19,697 --> 00:30:22,638
and I will make sure
that you never work again.

433
00:30:22,763 --> 00:30:24,947
I hate you. I hate you!

434
00:30:25,525 --> 00:30:27,190
This is all your fault.

435
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,647
How could you do this crap?

436
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:54,375
- I just want to say...
- I know what you're saying, so shut up.

437
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,063
Jesus, she almost died in the lobby.
I should never have listened to you.

438
00:30:58,427 --> 00:31:00,774
I'm going to remove her other breast,
like she asked me to,

439
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,792
so that she doesn't have to.

440
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,448
What I was going to say,

441
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,437
Christian, is that you were right.

442
00:31:12,198 --> 00:31:14,371
It's what Roxy wants. It's her body.

443
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:20,123
She's alone, and she turned to us
with her fears, and we didn't listen.

444
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:23,557
I didn't listen.

445
00:31:24,746 --> 00:31:25,812
I'm sorry.

446
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,508
And let me tell you from experience,
there is nothing worse

447
00:31:30,633 --> 00:31:33,035
than having to face
your fears alone.

448
00:31:34,949 --> 00:31:37,077
Give me 15 blade. Come on.
Hurry up!

449
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:45,887
We lost her.

450
00:31:47,352 --> 00:31:48,502
Olivia's dead.

451
00:32:14,587 --> 00:32:17,243
- it wasn't your fault.
- Isn't it?

452
00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:21,437
I wanted her to die.

453
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:24,698
I had this fantasy
during the surgery...

454
00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:29,254
this urge to just...

455
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:34,493
I wanted her out of Julia's life
so I could get back in.

456
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:38,443
Fantasizing about something
and actually doing something about it...

457
00:32:38,568 --> 00:32:40,246
2 completely different things.

458
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:42,324
You know the real irony in this?

459
00:32:43,081 --> 00:32:44,831
Now that Olivia's dead...

460
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:48,619
I've lost Julia...

461
00:32:49,528 --> 00:32:50,528
forever.

462
00:32:54,076 --> 00:32:56,595
I feel like I'm in some Greek play.

463
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,917
You try to control your fate,

464
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:01,808
but the gods have other plans.

465
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,166
Maybe I'm just, uh...

466
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:11,308
not supposed to have her.

467
00:33:12,738 --> 00:33:14,742
Maybe I'm supposed to...

468
00:33:16,353 --> 00:33:17,374
be alone.

469
00:33:19,095 --> 00:33:22,597
I think that's my fortune cookie
you're reading there, pretty boy,

470
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:24,023
not yours.

471
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,195
Dr. Kotchman called
with the toxicology report.

472
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:37,182
Olivia was on antidepressants,
and she didn't tell us.

473
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:42,504
- Are you sure?
- That's why she went into arrest...

474
00:33:42,766 --> 00:33:44,672
mixing it with the anesthesia.

475
00:33:44,797 --> 00:33:46,105
If she had told us,

476
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:48,890
we could have weaned her off
before the operation.

477
00:33:49,015 --> 00:33:50,825
She should have known better.

478
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,547
We didn't do it, Sean.

479
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:10,830
It doesn't make sense.

480
00:34:10,955 --> 00:34:12,902
Why would she keep that a secret?

481
00:34:13,027 --> 00:34:14,971
Maybe she felt embarrassed.

482
00:34:15,184 --> 00:34:17,765
A healer taking medication for
an emotional disorder in.

483
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,440
Went against everything
she believed in.

484
00:34:20,621 --> 00:34:23,397
New York's going to be so strange
without her now.

485
00:34:27,806 --> 00:34:29,198
You're still going?

486
00:34:32,247 --> 00:34:35,544
On one of our early dates,
Olivia took me to the cloisters.

487
00:34:37,132 --> 00:34:40,244
She loved the architecture there
and the history.

488
00:34:41,051 --> 00:34:42,840
It's where we fell in love.

489
00:34:44,111 --> 00:34:47,121
Spreading her ashes there
is what she'd want me to do.

490
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:49,445
Like hell she would.

491
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:53,746
I did not just suffer
the red-eye from Budapest

492
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:56,921
to have you steal my mother away
from me yet again,

493
00:34:57,056 --> 00:34:58,980
you bony little parasite.

494
00:35:09,646 --> 00:35:12,804
Well, at least you made it easy
for me to take her home.

495
00:35:13,824 --> 00:35:17,474
Getting the coffin through customs
would be a bit of a hassle.

496
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,831
I didn't expect to see you here.

497
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:23,800
Don't they usually arrest hacks
who kill their patients during surgery?

498
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:26,248
Eden, I'm very sorry
about what happened,

499
00:35:26,745 --> 00:35:29,877
but your mother died because she never
disclosed the medication she was taking.

500
00:35:30,807 --> 00:35:33,584
She kept her prescription
a secret from all of us.

501
00:35:33,811 --> 00:35:36,300
You mean the antidepressants
she was on for the last 6 months?

502
00:35:37,664 --> 00:35:40,345
- That secret?
- How did you know?

503
00:35:42,782 --> 00:35:45,114
Oh, I knew all of her
secrets, Julia.

504
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:49,772
Like the real reason why she
started to take the pills to begin with.

505
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:51,932
She was depressed...

506
00:35:55,178 --> 00:35:57,278
because she was
the one who shot you.

507
00:36:02,514 --> 00:36:05,030
She started drinking after you told her
you slept with Christian.

508
00:36:05,155 --> 00:36:08,405
She was a mess, and you were
in the bed weak and tired.

509
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,543
The day she shot you,
she was completely smashed.

510
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,460
She must have thought
you were a burglar.

511
00:36:14,585 --> 00:36:17,557
- You're lying.
- She was miserable, Julia.

512
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:19,711
You made her that way.

513
00:36:19,836 --> 00:36:23,049
- And in the end, you killed her.
- You expect us to believe all that?

514
00:36:23,174 --> 00:36:26,234
It doesn't matter what you believe.
It's the truth.

515
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:28,729
Why do you think I left the country?

516
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,901
Huh? I've been keeping this
a secret the entire time.

517
00:36:32,026 --> 00:36:34,433
I couldn't turn my mother in,
could I?

518
00:36:36,056 --> 00:36:37,306
Think about it.

519
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:41,658
Maybe she didn't tell anyone
that she was on the medication because

520
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,844
she wanted to die in surgery

521
00:36:44,523 --> 00:36:47,391
'cause she couldn't live with the guilt
of what she did anymore.

522
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:51,244
No. She didn't have to do that
if it was an accident.

523
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:52,708
I would have forgiven her.

524
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,828
Well, it's a little too late
for that, isn't it?

525
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:03,719
You know what the
really shocking thing is?

526
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:05,582
She actually loved you.

527
00:37:09,015 --> 00:37:12,983
That's why it hurt so
much when she nearly killed you.

528
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:18,791
But if you think that you could
forgive her for what she did...

529
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,747
then I guess...

530
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:26,383
you deserve to have her back.

531
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:46,547
- You want to hear a bedtime story?
- I heardyo'stink bitch again.

532
00:37:46,802 --> 00:37:48,931
What? Who played that for you?

533
00:37:49,163 --> 00:37:50,308
Daddy did.

534
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:54,104
It's catchy. It's number 8
on youtube and climbing.

535
00:37:57,807 --> 00:38:00,943
Aunt lizzie thinks
that's a very nasty song

536
00:38:01,982 --> 00:38:03,670
and not for little boys.

537
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:08,112
It's time for you to go to sleep.
Give me a little kiss.

538
00:38:09,862 --> 00:38:12,748
Don't you let those bedbugs
bite you, OK?

539
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,745
Good night, auntie Liz. I love you.

540
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,922
And I love you.

541
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,674
Will you be here in the morning?

542
00:38:23,745 --> 00:38:24,930
Probably not.

543
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:28,555
But I am going to see you
very, very soon, OK?

544
00:38:30,248 --> 00:38:31,558
Nighty-night, buddy boy.

545
00:38:39,993 --> 00:38:41,285
Are you leaving?

546
00:38:42,805 --> 00:38:44,777
- Are you mad?
- No.

547
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,524
The truth is,

548
00:38:49,796 --> 00:38:54,618
I'm sensing that he's beginning to
expect me here even in the mornings,

549
00:38:54,743 --> 00:38:57,869
and I just... I don't think that's
a good idea for any of us,

550
00:38:57,994 --> 00:38:59,710
you know, for the obvious reasons.

551
00:39:00,032 --> 00:39:01,880
- Which are?
- Well, mainly,

552
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:04,925
I'm not your significant other.

553
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:08,719
Well, you are kind of.
I mean, not really, but sort of.

554
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,528
In what world

555
00:39:11,764 --> 00:39:13,812
would something like that
make me feel good?

556
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:16,293
In the real world.
Just be real with me.

557
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:20,031
You want real? OK. All right.

558
00:39:22,662 --> 00:39:24,077
I lied about Steven.

559
00:39:25,182 --> 00:39:27,332
I didn't have a fabulous orgasm.

560
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:30,704
It was more like being bitten
by an oversized mosquito.

561
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:32,462
It was hell.

562
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:35,845
Christian, I don't like men.

563
00:39:37,713 --> 00:39:38,857
I like you.

564
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:48,708
Told you I was the shit.
You are shit. That's for sure.

565
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:52,805
But the point is,
it has nothing to do with technique

566
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,740
or gender. It's you.

567
00:39:57,141 --> 00:39:58,423
You are a jerk.

568
00:39:59,173 --> 00:40:01,991
You're pompous,
ridiculous, infuriating,

569
00:40:02,116 --> 00:40:04,778
and yet, somehow, I get it.
I get it.

570
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,247
And underneath it all,

571
00:40:10,427 --> 00:40:12,768
I know that you've
got my back in a way

572
00:40:12,893 --> 00:40:14,445
that nobody else does

573
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,113
or ever has, and...

574
00:40:19,556 --> 00:40:22,048
I know who you are, Christian.

575
00:40:23,179 --> 00:40:26,306
I watch how hard
you struggle to be strong,

576
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:29,439
and you struggle to be better,
and I don't know.

577
00:40:29,993 --> 00:40:32,476
Somehow, it just moves me.

578
00:40:33,896 --> 00:40:36,465
And I don't know what to say.

579
00:40:36,646 --> 00:40:39,644
- I think I'm...
- Not the "L" word. Stop right there.

580
00:40:41,928 --> 00:40:43,940
I get it.
I feel exactly the same way.

581
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:48,268
Most of the time,
you drive me batshit, but...

582
00:40:49,612 --> 00:40:51,962
you're the only
woman I really trust.

583
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:56,235
And you care about me
unconditionally...

584
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,543
understand me and my kid and...

585
00:41:04,306 --> 00:41:07,182
- I love you for that.
- No "L" word, remember?

586
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:14,231
Is it really so terrible for
Wilbur to wake up to aunt Lizzie

587
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,274
at breakfast several
mornings a week?
