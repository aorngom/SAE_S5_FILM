1
00:00:00,686 --> 00:00:02,309
Previously on Nip/Tuck...

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:03,895
You guys are
screwing each other.

3
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:06,591
You really don't give
a shit about me.

4
00:00:06,711 --> 00:00:07,581
I tried.

5
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:08,920
Stop it, please...

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,817
No, I won't stop...
not until we're together again.

7
00:00:11,937 --> 00:00:13,152
I am pregnant.

8
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:15,004
It's Sean's sperm.

9
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:17,115
- And this is?
- Ramona... my fiancee.

10
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:19,699
I'm gonna work for her
father in his carpet business.

11
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:22,167
Matt doesn't want either
of you in his life anymore.

12
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:24,184
The whole therapy thing
is bullshit.

13
00:00:24,304 --> 00:00:25,240
You're right.

14
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,724
We should just end it,
end us.

15
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,163
- Ok. You ok there, dad?
- Yeah. Yeah.

16
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:37,237
Ok.

17
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,451
So, Mr. and Mrs. Krieger,

18
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:42,923
tell me what you don't
like about yourself?

19
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,745
I see you're both
booked for the consult.

20
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:48,179
We want our tattoos removed.

21
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:53,432
This strikes me
as a very big decision.

22
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:54,797
Yes.
Well,

23
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:58,272
it first occurred to me
when I was watching

24
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,922
this documentary
on the TV

25
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:02,589
about Buchenwald.

26
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:04,695
And suddenly,
I was overwhelmed.

27
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,723
And I thought,
well,

28
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:09,582
we have lived
such a great life.

29
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:13,987
We've survived so much
since then. So, I...

30
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:17,250
I want to erase
this obsession

31
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,557
with terrible things
from the past.

32
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,696
You can see, she...

33
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,343
she's a remarkable woman.

34
00:01:24,463 --> 00:01:26,803
That's not what
you said in the car, dad.

35
00:01:26,923 --> 00:01:28,661
Allie, please.
Shh.

36
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:30,587
How can I keep
my mouth shut

37
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:33,597
when holocaust deniers
are more vocal than ever?

38
00:01:33,717 --> 00:01:36,864
When so many survivors
have passed,

39
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:39,924
why would you want
to erase one single reminder?

40
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:43,130
My daughter is upset,
and I understand.

41
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,263
She has
a different perspective.

42
00:01:45,383 --> 00:01:46,611
And you, Walter?

43
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,476
Are you sure
this is what you want?

44
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:52,729
At the end of the day,
I want what Edith wants.

45
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:56,143
She is my inspiration.

46
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:58,704
This will be a chance,

47
00:01:58,824 --> 00:02:01,312
a second chance,
for some joy.

48
00:02:01,432 --> 00:02:03,454
And I can give it to her?

49
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:06,694
Yes. Take...
take it off.

50
00:02:06,814 --> 00:02:08,487
You need to be
aware that, uh,

51
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:10,761
the work on the elderly
is not as simple.

52
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,355
The skin is much thinner,
healing takes longer,

53
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:15,816
and infection is
always a possibility.

54
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,923
Doctor,

55
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:20,103
after what we've
been through, please.

56
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,245
This is bupkis.

57
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:23,735
Yeah.

63
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:18,967
God. These new corporate taxes
are killing our bottom line.

64
00:03:19,087 --> 00:03:20,428
For every set
of implants we do,

65
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:22,469
it's like Uncle Sam
gets one titty for himself.

66
00:03:22,589 --> 00:03:25,336
Still, it's a pretty good net,
all things considered.

67
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:27,215
I guess you're right...

68
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:30,192
For those tax returns
over the years.

69
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,514
Well, I should get going.

70
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:36,194
You can get all that stuff
to the accountant, all right?

71
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:38,102
You're not staying?
I got dinner coming.

72
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:40,140
No.
I'd love to, but, uh...

73
00:03:40,776 --> 00:03:42,265
Maybe some other time.

74
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:46,474
Hey.

75
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,740
Hey.

76
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:49,121
Uh, can I come in?

77
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,382
Hey, Matty. You brought
enough for 3, right?

78
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:53,377
- Yeah, of course.
- Ok.

79
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,947
Yeah.

80
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:58,402
Is this some kind of setup?

81
00:03:58,522 --> 00:04:00,361
I don't know
what you're talking about.

82
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:01,496
Wow.
Smells good.

83
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,808
Yeah. Ramona's been
cooking all day.

84
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:07,153
Ok. I guess I'm staying
for a bite.

85
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:09,502
Good.
I'll get some plates.

86
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,856
So, your fiancee
cooked all of this?

87
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:14,325
Yeah. She was just trying
to support me. And...

88
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:17,436
after we heard what happened
at the shrink's office, you know...

89
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:20,419
Uh, she actually
wanted me

90
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:22,426
to bring you
both this.

91
00:04:23,782 --> 00:04:25,070
What is it?

92
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,297
It's in Spanish.
I don't know what...

93
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:34,898
Let's see.
It says, uh,...

94
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:38,054
"please join us in celebrating
the marriage of our daughter

95
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:41,194
Ramona Perez and
Matt McNamara. Casual attire,"

96
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,611
then something about parking
instructions. I don't know.

97
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:46,560
I, uh, started
learning Spanish.

98
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,047
I want Jenna
to be bilingual,

99
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:50,597
especially since half her family
is gonna be speaking it soon.

100
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:52,603
So, you're inviting us
to your wedding now?

101
00:04:52,723 --> 00:04:53,423
Yeah.

102
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,335
I thought you didn't want us
in your life anymore.

103
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:59,919
Ramona has made me see just
how important family is.

104
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:06,249
I was on the can all
night after those tamales.

105
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:08,661
I know. I even had mine
for breakfast.

106
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:11,297
- She's mine.
- Oh, you think so?

107
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:12,171
Yup.

108
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:15,582
Good morning.

109
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:17,625
How can we
help you, miss?

110
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:31,014
I know you like 'em
young, Ava,

111
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:34,110
but shouldn't you at least wait
for his testicles to descend?

112
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,918
His name is Rafael.

113
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:37,656
He's my adopted son.

114
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:39,985
As I recall, you left
your last son on the floor

115
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:43,048
to decompose while you
dashed off to gay Paris.

116
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:45,159
After I left, I, uh,

117
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,466
I rented
a small pension in...

118
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:49,159
Le Quartier Latin

119
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,648
where I...

120
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,339
wept for days.

121
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:57,291
Weeks passed before
I received a letter from Baltimore.

122
00:05:57,411 --> 00:06:00,822
Adrian's death had been
determined to be a suicide,

123
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:02,247
which it was.

124
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,688
I was cleared
of all wrongdoing.

125
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:07,657
So, naturally, you jumped
on the next plane back to Miami

126
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:09,632
to give your son
a proper burial.

127
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:13,174
I used my grief as fuel
...to move on.

128
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:14,684
Adrian was covered
in maggots.

129
00:06:14,804 --> 00:06:15,588
Stop!

130
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:17,090
Please.

131
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:19,196
Have a little decency.

132
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:21,706
I don't think you should be
lecturing us on decency.

133
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:23,480
Look. Whatever
you're here for,

134
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,472
there's no procedure
we could do

135
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:28,033
that Dr. Moore
couldn't do just as well.

136
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:30,711
Barrett's dead.

137
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,610
Series of strokes.

138
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:39,406
I am not the monster
you think I am.

139
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:41,646
All my life, I've tried
to turn tragedy

140
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,507
into something
meaningful.

141
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:46,437
I started a foundation with
the money Barrett left me

142
00:06:46,557 --> 00:06:48,861
that subsidizes
corrective surgery for

143
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:50,537
third-world children.

144
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:00,126
Leishmaniasis.

145
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,804
It looks like leprosy.

146
00:07:03,984 --> 00:07:06,853
Black fever, Jericho buttons,
it's the same thing.

147
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:09,387
It's endemic in areas
around the Amazon.

148
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:13,203
Amphotericin b, I think, is
the recommended treatment.

149
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:14,954
Side effects are horrible,

150
00:07:15,074 --> 00:07:17,156
often lethal
in a child his age.

151
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,738
Would he survive?
My brave little Rafael?

152
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,870
He's free of
the parasite, but...

153
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,280
has you can see,
it's left its mark.

154
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:26,995
So, why bring him to us?

155
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:28,518
Because
you're the best,

156
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:30,864
and I want what's best
for my son.

157
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,806
You'd do the same
for Matt, wouldn't you?

158
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:36,221
You know, why don't you
leave your contact information

159
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:38,628
at the desk, and we'll
send you a list of referrals?

160
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:41,292
And please don't ever
talk about Matt again.

161
00:07:47,853 --> 00:07:50,698
Rafael's only crime was
being born into poverty.

162
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:52,872
And now
he's scarred for life.

163
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:56,471
I'm trying to give him
a second chance.

164
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:00,035
Perhaps you think that
Beverly Hills matrons

165
00:08:00,155 --> 00:08:02,295
who come to you for
face-lifts are more...

166
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,500
deserving.

167
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:16,221
We're not doing it.

168
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:17,942
Don't get carried away.

169
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:19,191
She's evil.

170
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:21,255
But that baby is
just a sick child.

171
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,649
And it is intriguing from
a medical point of view.

172
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,549
Look. I know you and I
try to mend fences

173
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:27,491
and all that bullshit.
I get it, ok?

174
00:08:27,611 --> 00:08:29,854
But I don't give a shit
if Ava comes in here

175
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:32,850
with baby Jesus himself.
We're not helping her.

176
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:43,327
All right.

177
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:46,624
This procedure will only
take about 20 minutes,

178
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:49,852
as soon as our anesthesiologist
gets off the phone.

179
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,353
Where are my tunes?

180
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:53,590
Ok, I'm sorry.
That was my gynecologist.

181
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,636
I just got my CVS results.
My baby is perfect.

182
00:08:56,756 --> 00:08:58,176
Oh, Mazel Tov.

183
00:08:58,296 --> 00:09:00,416
How far along are you,
darling?

184
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:03,546
I am 12 weeks, just
past my first trimester.

185
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,410
Can we dial down
the estrogen, please

186
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,983
and get
my music cranking?

187
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:08,911
The machine's
on the fritz.

188
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:14,037
Dr. Troy, could I sing
a song for my wife?

189
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:15,550
It will relax her.

190
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,842
Fine by me.

191
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:12,271
I didn't think you weren't coming
into town for a few days.

192
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:14,833
- You look great, Julia.
- Thank you, Christian.

193
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:17,214
You haven't changed a bit.
- Thanks.

194
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:19,296
So, where are
Connor and Annie?

195
00:10:19,364 --> 00:10:21,668
Uh, they're at the hotel.

196
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,201
I thought it best that
I came to see you first.

197
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:26,155
Oh, you gotta see
my new apartment.

198
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,599
There's plenty of room.
You guys could stay there.

199
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:30,775
It's probably easier
than a hotel.

200
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:34,273
I'm getting married
again, Sean.

201
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,114
Congrats.
Good for you.

202
00:10:40,482 --> 00:10:42,320
Is it 2 brides?
2 grooms?

203
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,729
Woman?
Beast?

204
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:46,006
His name's Edmund,
and, um,

205
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:48,647
he lives in Knightsbridge,
in England.

206
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,826
And he has
an estate somewhere

207
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:53,651
that's been in the family
for, like, 400 years.

208
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:55,730
Uh, what about our kids?

209
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,596
I want them
to come with me.

210
00:11:00,716 --> 00:11:04,783
Yeah, well, London is a
10-hour flight from L.A., so...

211
00:11:06,356 --> 00:11:08,599
Yeah, I know.
And, um,

212
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,126
well, I need
your permission.

213
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,063
You know, it's hard
enough finding time

214
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:16,954
to fly across the country
to see them.

215
00:11:17,074 --> 00:11:19,093
Now I'm supposed
to fly across the Atlantic?

216
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:21,135
They need their father.
Ok?

217
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:23,016
They need
a stable family.

218
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:25,794
Well, I'm not giving up
my rights to my children

219
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:29,345
just so you can play
house 6,000 miles away.

220
00:11:48,237 --> 00:11:49,791
It's bullshit,
is what it is.

221
00:11:49,911 --> 00:11:51,400
I can't take a week off
from work

222
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:53,526
every time I want to see
my kids. It's not realistic.

223
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,264
And what about
the time difference?

224
00:11:55,384 --> 00:11:57,590
If I don't call them by noon
L.A. time, they'll be in bed.

225
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,996
Can I get a 400?

226
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,773
You know, whether
we're married or not,

227
00:12:00,893 --> 00:12:02,662
we still have to do
what's best for the kids.

228
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:04,218
And she's not
remembering that.

229
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:07,181
You know, I think that you're the one
who's forgetting what this is about.

230
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:09,372
You're really losing her.
- Julia?

231
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:10,692
What are you saying?

232
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:12,724
Look, I know how you
feel about the kids.

233
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:15,288
But what you're really
pissed off about is, she's going.

234
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:18,200
She's going for good this time.
And you still love her.

235
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,665
So, tell me
about this guy.

236
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:24,920
Ed?

237
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:29,288
Well, he's a little older
than I am.

238
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:32,669
He's very intellectual.
He reads a lot.

239
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:33,841
He's, um,

240
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:36,401
I don't know.
He's charming.

241
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:37,690
Rich?

242
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:39,210
I hope.

243
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,342
I don't want you flitting off
to London with some kind of

244
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,884
saggy-balled bookworm
from Barnes & Noble.

245
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:47,590
Well, let's just say
he works very hard,

246
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,590
and his balls are
far from saggy.

247
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,095
- Good.
- Ok?

248
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:51,901
Ok.

249
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:56,962
- How pissed is Sean?
- You are stealing his kids.

250
00:12:57,082 --> 00:12:57,953
I know.

251
00:12:58,354 --> 00:13:01,230
Uh, we all have
to move on with our lives.

252
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,989
You're getting no arguments from me.
Trust me. Not on that one.

253
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:11,567
You look great.

254
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:13,495
Thank you.

255
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:15,400
So do you.

256
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:18,949
Thanks.

257
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:24,221
How are you doing?

258
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:28,794
In all honesty, this whole
Sean thing's got me a little...

259
00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:31,894
You do know that he dragged
me to couple therapy.

260
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:34,491
Then you know he's always
gone through these dark phases.

261
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:36,564
You know he did
when we were married.

262
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:38,020
He gets through it.

263
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,055
This time feels different.

264
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,131
You look great.

265
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:54,450
I'll be right back.

266
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:06,231
You want to know
what's weird?

267
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,051
Every time I see you,
I get a hard-on.

268
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:13,695
After all these years...

269
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:16,812
Does it have to be you...
[incompréhensible]

270
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:18,755
...when I can put it
in my pants?

271
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,508
Christian, stop.

272
00:14:21,998 --> 00:14:24,491
You're moving very,
very far away.

273
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:40,607
Oh, Christian.

274
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:46,398
Coming.

275
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:56,102
I'd fire my receptionist

276
00:14:56,222 --> 00:14:58,560
if she gave out
personal information.

277
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,251
But then again,
I'm very persuasive.

278
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:04,512
Sorry. I, uh,
I should have called, but...

279
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:07,459
You would have said no.
- I still could say no.

280
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:10,792
To a woman with a baby
who needs your help?

281
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:14,171
No, Sean.
You're not that man.

282
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:25,800
You want a drink?

283
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,495
No, thanks,
but feel free.

284
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:30,406
I know you had
a hard day.

285
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:37,081
You two should see
a professional.

286
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:39,139
And by "you two,"
I assume you mean...

287
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:41,167
Your...
other half.

288
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:44,066
Notice I didn't say
"better."

289
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:47,864
Well,

290
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:49,421
we're fine.

291
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:52,849
You're either in denial,
or you're very selective

292
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:54,877
about the reality
you accept.

293
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:03,948
He's beautiful.

294
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,354
Yeah.

295
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:07,346
He will be.

296
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:11,363
But his spirit is
sheer radiance.

297
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:16,033
So, we'll keep looking for
a doctor who will help me...

298
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:20,083
so that his
appearance can...

299
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:22,978
match the soul
that's inside.

300
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:27,747
I know you want to.

301
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:32,366
There are so many children
who could use your help.

302
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,447
It's your choice,
you know?

303
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:38,639
You don't need
his approval.

304
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,533
It just feels that way.

305
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:51,430
Oh, look at you.

306
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:58,333
I would need all of
his medical information...

307
00:16:58,453 --> 00:17:01,020
doctors' records,
blood workups...

308
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:03,243
I can try to find them.

309
00:17:03,363 --> 00:17:05,251
I've been moving
around so much.

310
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:07,212
No, just give me
the name of the hospital

311
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:09,136
where they gave him
the amphotericin b,

312
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:11,312
and I will get
in touch with them.

313
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,011
Ava...

314
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:28,317
Why don't you tell me
how you got this baby?

315
00:17:30,276 --> 00:17:32,318
I, uh, I told you.

316
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:34,946
I should have
known better

317
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,295
than to be taken in
by you.

318
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:38,376
Get out.

319
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:47,999
They had one caretaker
for 50 babies... one.

320
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:51,196
They let them cry
themselves to sleep.

321
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:54,124
After weeks of doing nothing
but crying and screaming

322
00:17:54,244 --> 00:17:56,016
and wanting
to be held...

323
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:59,111
They learned to stop,

324
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,203
to need nothing.

325
00:18:02,642 --> 00:18:07,092
Mothering a suicide didn't make me
a prime candidate for adoption.

326
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,083
My...

327
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,748
past, it seems, hangs
around my neck like a noose.

328
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:13,823
I brought a small bag.

329
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:18,427
Seen me with it before, so
no one bothered to check it...

330
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:20,636
empty going in,
and...

331
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,113
with this beautiful...

332
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:27,515
if damaged...
Little boy coming out.

333
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:34,660
Was it illegal?
Yes.

334
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:37,844
But you tell me.
Was it immoral?

335
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:39,621
Should I have
left him there?

336
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:41,336
Scarred?
Malnourished?

337
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:43,313
Virtually unadoptable?

338
00:18:44,435 --> 00:18:46,299
So he could
grow up alone

339
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:48,803
and outcast for
the rest of his life?

340
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:51,863
Like me?

341
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:54,476
You're incapable
of telling the truth.

342
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:02,008
Get out.

343
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,435
Maybe I was wrong
about you, Sean.

344
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,696
Whatever it is
that keeps you so...

345
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:22,962
locked up and judgmental
and unhappy...

346
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:27,715
Maybe it's got nothing at
all to do with Christian.

347
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:44,816
Oh. Doctor,
I'm so glad to see you.

348
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:46,440
We had to take a bus,

349
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,570
because my daughter
didn't answer her phone.

350
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,162
How you doing, Walter?

351
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,699
This one gets a tattoo...

352
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,694
...and that one gets no tattoo

353
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,490
Get me a wheelchair.

354
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,693
He woke up this morning.

355
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:01,803
His arm was swollen
like a balloon.

356
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,397
I'm sure it's just
a staph infection.

357
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:04,920
Walter, you're gonna
come with me, all right?

358
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,778
You're gonna get up with me.
We're gonna get into the chair.

359
00:20:06,898 --> 00:20:08,237
The little children.

360
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:10,811
We're gonna hook you up to
an IV, get you into a bed.

361
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:14,098
You should be fit as
a fiddle in a couple of days.

362
00:20:15,002 --> 00:20:17,245
So, this is
our finest Berber,

363
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:20,645
perfect for high-traffic areas
such as your living room.

364
00:20:20,713 --> 00:20:22,394
Um, here.

365
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:23,999
There you go.

366
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:26,415
Take your shoes off.

367
00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:28,167
Run your toes through it.

368
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:31,062
Ooh, I love it, Tony.

369
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:33,385
How is it with dog pee-pee?

370
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:35,212
Don't start with
that again, Anita, ok?

371
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:37,117
Because I'm pretty happy
with the linoleum.

372
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,075
Yeah, but you said that when
your mom came to live with us

373
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:41,002
that we were gonna be
getting new carpeting.

374
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:44,179
I know that, but I don't know why
you always have to criticize...

375
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:50,422
Hello, Matt.

376
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:12,664
What are you doing here?

377
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:15,107
You look good, Matt.

378
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:18,086
Where have you been
the past 6 years?

379
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,832
I tried looking for you.

380
00:21:21,552 --> 00:21:24,531
I always want that things to
turn out differently than they did.

381
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,421
I'm getting married
in 3 days.

382
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:27,460
I know.

383
00:21:28,072 --> 00:21:29,542
That's why I came.
I, uh,

384
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:31,425
I have a gift for you.

385
00:21:39,168 --> 00:21:41,059
That's a lot of money, Ava.

386
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:43,878
It's the least
I can do after

387
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:46,733
all the horrible things
I've done in the past.

388
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:50,146
You deserve a fresh start.

389
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:53,510
Is everything
all right, Matthew?

390
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,282
Yeah, honey.
Hi. Um...

391
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:57,345
Hi.

392
00:21:57,646 --> 00:21:59,444
Uh, this is Ava Moore,

393
00:21:59,564 --> 00:22:01,419
an old friend
of the family.

394
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,222
And she just came by,
actually,

395
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,218
to give us
a wedding gift.

396
00:22:06,338 --> 00:22:09,285
Ava, this is
my fiancee Ramona.

397
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:17,970
And who is this
precious little thing?

398
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:21,279
Uh, that's
my daughter Jenna.

399
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:23,405
Hello, sweetheart.

400
00:22:25,982 --> 00:22:27,706
She's just perfect.

401
00:22:32,443 --> 00:22:35,854
Well, I think the three of
you make a wonderful family.

402
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,698
I'm so happy for you.

403
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,677
Well, thank you.

404
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,273
I have, um,

405
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:49,480
business
back in Los Angeles.

406
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,933
Yeah. Traffic gets
pretty bad around here.

407
00:22:52,053 --> 00:22:54,370
You might want get
on the road early.

408
00:22:56,612 --> 00:23:00,110
I hope your wedding is
everything you dream it will be.

409
00:23:01,968 --> 00:23:03,474
Bye, sweetheart.

410
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,637
You good?

411
00:23:24,428 --> 00:23:26,352
Same shit,
different day.

412
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,009
You ok?

413
00:23:28,562 --> 00:23:32,023
You a little hung over from your
bachelorette party with Julia?

414
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:33,935
Very hung over.

415
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,910
- Did you sleep with her?
- No.

416
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:43,124
But it wasn't for
lack of trying.

417
00:23:44,393 --> 00:23:46,622
Christian, stop.

418
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:50,134
No!

419
00:23:50,254 --> 00:23:51,791
I don't want this.

420
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:57,044
I used to get butterflies
whenever you walked into a room,

421
00:23:57,663 --> 00:24:01,228
or if you called the house
to talk to Sean and I picked up.

422
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:05,493
I thought about you
when I was making love

423
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:07,554
to other men,
even Sean.

424
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:13,361
And I thought
for one second...

425
00:24:13,663 --> 00:24:15,788
that I felt
that way tonight.

426
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:19,470
But I don't.

427
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:22,800
I still love you.
But that...

428
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:25,411
thing that we had,
that...

429
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:28,206
electricity...

430
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,056
that's gone...

431
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:34,484
Forever.

432
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:43,318
That's kind of
a kick in the nuts, huh?

433
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:45,326
Well, one you deserved.

434
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:48,056
How could you do that?
How could you do that to me?

435
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:49,509
I don't know
what you're talking about.

436
00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:51,317
I spill my heart out to you.

437
00:24:51,437 --> 00:24:53,242
I tell you that I'm still
in love with her,

438
00:24:53,362 --> 00:24:55,434
and you try to screw her
in the bathroom of some bar?

439
00:24:55,554 --> 00:24:58,615
Hey. You know what, buddy boy?
Like it or not, there's 3 of us. Ok?

440
00:24:58,735 --> 00:25:00,516
I'm not saying
it's a good thing,

441
00:25:00,636 --> 00:25:02,065
but I love her, too.

442
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,806
That's your justification?

443
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:05,815
I'm sorry if this is
hard for you to hear.

444
00:25:05,935 --> 00:25:07,706
If you want to hit me
or you want to quit

445
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:09,530
or do whatever it is
that you like to do,

446
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,818
you just go for it, ok?

447
00:25:10,938 --> 00:25:13,897
But I'm not gonna apologize
for what I did last night.

448
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:18,072
You're right.

449
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:25,788
We both need to have
our own way with this.

450
00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:40,698
I'll be around at 9:00
to pick up the kids.

451
00:25:40,818 --> 00:25:43,995
If I'm gonna consider this,
I think you should stay a bit.

452
00:25:44,282 --> 00:25:46,324
Seems the least
you could do.

453
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:49,303
Tell me a little bit
about this new guy.

454
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,735
Oh, come on.

455
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,985
I won't bite.

456
00:25:58,031 --> 00:25:58,985
Cheers.

457
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:11,772
So,

458
00:26:12,374 --> 00:26:14,918
how did you meet this guy?

459
00:26:16,927 --> 00:26:20,140
At a mutual friend's
dinner party.

460
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:22,316
How did he propose?

461
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,080
- We were in bed.
- In bed?

462
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:30,291
What,
in the throes of passion?

463
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:31,231
Julia,

464
00:26:31,616 --> 00:26:33,775
I don't think you thought
this through very well.

465
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:34,618
Sean,

466
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:37,689
Edmund and I have been talking
about marriage for a few months.

467
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:40,367
Now, I know that it's gonna
be difficult for the kids

468
00:26:40,487 --> 00:26:42,603
being in a new country,
but...

469
00:26:42,723 --> 00:26:44,119
he loves them.

470
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:46,060
And they need him, too,
you know?

471
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,806
They need a father who
they can see every day.

472
00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:50,496
And you know what?

473
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:53,375
I can't do it
alone anymore.

474
00:26:56,304 --> 00:26:57,258
Julia...

475
00:27:01,392 --> 00:27:03,056
I'll move to New York,

476
00:27:03,176 --> 00:27:05,208
and we can all be
together again.

477
00:27:05,593 --> 00:27:07,635
We were
a happy family once.

478
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,300
Just say the word, and
we can have it all back again.

479
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,830
I still love you.

480
00:27:19,449 --> 00:27:22,495
I've always loved you.
I never stopped.

481
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:28,260
Julia, just stay
with me tonight.

482
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,044
And I'll show you
how good we can be...

483
00:27:30,164 --> 00:27:31,297
Oh, my God.

484
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,294
You and Christian...

485
00:27:33,414 --> 00:27:35,821
you are unbelievable.

486
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:38,757
You've never changed.

487
00:27:38,877 --> 00:27:41,228
Sean, you're both
trying the same trick...

488
00:27:41,348 --> 00:27:44,341
professing your love
to me like 2 teenagers.

489
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:48,073
I've grown up.
I've moved on.

490
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:51,069
It's time that you did, too.

491
00:27:56,492 --> 00:27:58,958
I'll pick up the kids at 9:00.

492
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,509
Walter,

493
00:28:20,122 --> 00:28:24,631
when you were delirious,
you were talking in German.

494
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:27,760
And you kept saying
this one thing

495
00:28:28,222 --> 00:28:30,974
over and over.
You said,

496
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:34,353
"what did we do
to the children?"

497
00:28:35,116 --> 00:28:37,550
What were you talking about?

498
00:28:39,374 --> 00:28:42,855
Edith, I... I wouldn't
have known what it was.

499
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,595
I was delirious, Edith.

500
00:28:44,715 --> 00:28:47,490
No, no.
There was something...

501
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:49,750
in your voice.

502
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:52,425
There's something different.

503
00:28:52,545 --> 00:28:56,575
When you kept talking
about the children, you said,

504
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:59,171
"what did... we,"

505
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:02,323
like you were
one of them.

506
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:05,975
Walter, please. Tell me
I'm afraid for nothing. 

507
00:29:06,095 --> 00:29:08,536
Tell me you don't know
what I'm talking about.

508
00:29:08,656 --> 00:29:10,891
I didn't sleep all night.

509
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:15,863
Walter, what did you do?

510
00:29:17,677 --> 00:29:20,706
I was...
I was just a tattooist, Edith.

511
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:23,247
I was not the exterminator.

512
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:25,574
- Is everything all right here?
- No.

513
00:29:25,694 --> 00:29:28,057
Is not all right.
- What are you talking about?

514
00:29:28,177 --> 00:29:31,988
I... I gave
the prisoners the tattoos.

515
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:38,088
Only the strong ones.

516
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:41,023
It meant that
they could go to work.

517
00:29:41,391 --> 00:29:43,013
Without a tattoo,

518
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:45,031
they would be killed.

519
00:29:52,478 --> 00:29:57,027
When the war was over, and...
I escaped to California.

520
00:29:57,147 --> 00:30:00,692
And I promised God
to give me a second chance.

521
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:02,542
If he would give me
a second chance,

522
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,215
I would live like a Jew.

523
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:08,433
As a penance, I... I lived with
the people that I harmed.

524
00:30:08,717 --> 00:30:10,053
You see here?

525
00:30:10,173 --> 00:30:13,518
I gave myself...
I gave myself a tattoo.

526
00:30:13,638 --> 00:30:16,132
And I was your penance?

527
00:30:16,484 --> 00:30:17,504
Edith,

528
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,452
why I was given this gift,
I do not know,

529
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:22,760
but I was.

530
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:27,162
- God gave me you.
- God is a joke!

531
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:29,121
Edith,

532
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,899
does it count for nothing?

533
00:30:32,735 --> 00:30:34,476
What I have become?

534
00:30:35,247 --> 00:30:37,738
How long I have
been a good man?

535
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:40,904
You always talk
about forgiveness.

536
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:43,313
Forgiveness, Edith.

537
00:31:01,172 --> 00:31:01,992
Hi.

538
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:12,207
I came to return this.

539
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:15,487
Ramona's not
comfortable taking it.

540
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:17,546
And neither am I.

541
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:21,479
Such reverse snobbery.

542
00:31:26,112 --> 00:31:28,069
It would have been
easier just to...

543
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:30,358
stick it in the mill,
I would think.

544
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:34,343
Yeah, well, I like to drive
around sometimes at night.

545
00:31:34,463 --> 00:31:35,886
It clears my head.

546
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,948
Clarity's overrated.

547
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:43,717
Ramona wouldn't object to you
just having one drink, would she?

548
00:31:45,257 --> 00:31:46,914
Well, maybe just one.

549
00:31:47,634 --> 00:31:48,421
Good.

550
00:31:48,956 --> 00:31:50,292
Ramona trusts you...

551
00:31:50,412 --> 00:31:53,124
A good precedent to
begin one's married life.

552
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:55,032
Skol.

553
00:32:01,706 --> 00:32:03,179
You've grown older...

554
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:05,656
even more handsome.

555
00:32:07,095 --> 00:32:08,903
Love agrees with you.

556
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:13,028
Ramona is
very down to earth...

557
00:32:15,556 --> 00:32:16,634
And nice.

558
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:17,873
Good.

559
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:21,066
You, um, you deserve
someone nice.

560
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:23,112
You weren't very
nice at all.

561
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,883
Just incredibly...

562
00:32:25,003 --> 00:32:25,789
What?

563
00:32:28,418 --> 00:32:29,690
Beautiful.

564
00:32:31,061 --> 00:32:32,468
You still are.

565
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:37,238
Thank you.

566
00:32:38,242 --> 00:32:39,230
I, uh...

567
00:32:40,217 --> 00:32:41,573
I needed that.

568
00:32:45,071 --> 00:32:48,167
You always did know
exactly what to say.

569
00:33:36,987 --> 00:33:38,929
Sometimes in the dark,

570
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:41,557
when I'm with her,

571
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:45,188
I think about you.

572
00:33:48,184 --> 00:33:50,658
I fantasize what my life
would have been like

573
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,653
if I'd come away with you...

574
00:33:54,192 --> 00:33:55,832
If we'd been together.

575
00:33:57,221 --> 00:33:59,530
Listen to me, Matt.

576
00:34:01,037 --> 00:34:04,769
You found something
nice, stable.

577
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,313
So have I...

578
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,664
Beautiful baby boy.

579
00:34:15,614 --> 00:34:18,509
Forget this happened.
Forget you saw me again.

580
00:34:18,911 --> 00:34:21,103
For your sake
and Ramona's, just...

581
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:23,430
put me out
of your mind.

582
00:34:33,052 --> 00:34:34,676
You can't go.

583
00:34:36,684 --> 00:34:38,475
I won't let you.

584
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,618
I have no choice.

585
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:48,685
My baby needs help.

586
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,848
Hey.
What are you doing here?

587
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,994
Yeah.
We don't need any carpet.

588
00:35:05,798 --> 00:35:07,947
That's very funny,
actually. Um,

589
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:10,331
no. I wanted to talk to you
guys about something...

590
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:11,723
a wedding gift.

591
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:16,209
I'd like you to do
that surgery on Ava's baby.

592
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:19,328
Did she come to you?

593
00:35:19,448 --> 00:35:21,166
I knew we couldn't
trust that bitch.

594
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,619
She's not a bitch, man.

595
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:24,563
Her kid's really messed up.

596
00:35:25,266 --> 00:35:26,773
Did you sleep with her?

597
00:35:29,852 --> 00:35:32,228
Matty, Matty, Matty.

598
00:35:32,647 --> 00:35:35,726
She's like a drug to you,
as bad as meth.

599
00:35:35,846 --> 00:35:38,737
The second you're around her,
you start making bad decisions.

600
00:35:38,857 --> 00:35:41,163
Yeah, she seemed so
different, though, you know?

601
00:35:41,283 --> 00:35:43,791
Like being a real mom
softened her or something.

602
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:45,967
I'm sure she was all
puppy dogs and rainbows

603
00:35:46,087 --> 00:35:49,353
until she casually asked you
to talk to us about the surgery.

604
00:35:49,473 --> 00:35:50,327
Well...

605
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:53,406
that was my idea.
- No.

606
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,896
That was her idea.

607
00:35:55,016 --> 00:35:55,823
Matt,

608
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:59,044
you've got a shot at the real
thing here with Ramona...

609
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:01,691
true happiness
with a great girl.

610
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:03,482
Ava is just gonna toss you

611
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:05,809
aside the second
she's done with you.

612
00:36:11,414 --> 00:36:14,239
I'm such an asshole, and
she sucked me right in.

613
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:16,284
You're not an asshole.

614
00:36:16,903 --> 00:36:20,350
Come on, now.
What you need to do...

615
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,246
is, uh, go home

616
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:25,388
and get some sleep.

617
00:36:25,973 --> 00:36:27,932
You're getting
married tomorrow.

618
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:29,337
Yeah.

619
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:31,730
Thank you.

620
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,308
Thanks, guys.
I, uh,

621
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:37,009
I'm so glad to have you
back in my life.

622
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:39,462
And I just want
to keep you there.

623
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:49,200
There are your prescriptions,
pain pills, and antibiotics.

624
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,977
Why should
he get painkillers?

625
00:36:51,097 --> 00:36:53,024
He didn't give
his victims any painkillers.

626
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:53,878
Allison.

627
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:55,610
You remember Leena Gold
from Temple?

628
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,413
Yes.

629
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:58,385
She works with the
Simon Wiesenthal center.

630
00:36:58,505 --> 00:36:59,672
Oh, my God.

631
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,782
Allison,
what have you done?

632
00:37:02,902 --> 00:37:05,380
I decided to call
the OSL in Washington.

633
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,592
Is that part of
the Justice Department?

634
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:09,734
Yes. And if the evidence
warrants it,

635
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:13,178
Mr. Krieger,
or whatever his name is, 

636
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:17,251
will hopefully be deported
to stand trial for his crimes.

637
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,242
Mom, I'll take you home,
and then Leena

638
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:22,334
will stay here with him
and wait for them to come.

639
00:37:22,454 --> 00:37:24,426
I'm not going anywhere.

640
00:37:25,698 --> 00:37:26,435
Fine.

641
00:37:26,763 --> 00:37:28,544
Stay with your Nazi.

642
00:37:28,895 --> 00:37:30,399
He's my husband.

643
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:33,180
You are not the only
one he has to answer to.

644
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:35,388
Allison,
Mein Kind,

645
00:37:36,436 --> 00:37:39,958
how are you ever going
to live with yourself?

646
00:37:42,736 --> 00:37:44,099
Come, Allison.

647
00:37:44,711 --> 00:37:45,899
Come, dear.

648
00:37:53,653 --> 00:37:57,352
Where does it come from,
this capacity to forgive?

649
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:00,867
How do you do it?

650
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:07,528
How do you not?

651
00:38:40,783 --> 00:38:41,770
Hey!

652
00:38:42,457 --> 00:38:43,327
Hey.

653
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:46,035
It's quite a party, huh?

654
00:38:46,155 --> 00:38:48,733
Hey, Matty.
You look great.

655
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,389
So...

656
00:38:51,644 --> 00:38:52,448
So...

657
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:55,343
are you ready for this?

658
00:38:56,196 --> 00:38:59,122
You know what? For the first
time in my life, yeah.

659
00:38:59,242 --> 00:39:01,302
This feels right.

660
00:39:01,921 --> 00:39:03,508
There you are,
Matthew!

661
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,847
Hi.

662
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,866
Uh, Celia, this is my dad
Sean McNamara.

663
00:39:06,986 --> 00:39:08,590
- Oh, hello!
- Hello.

664
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,998
You have
a wonderful home.

665
00:39:10,118 --> 00:39:12,157
Oh, thank you,
Dr. McNamara.

666
00:39:12,277 --> 00:39:13,465
Welcome.

667
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:16,083
- Come.
- Ok. Uh...

668
00:39:30,231 --> 00:39:32,684
- Hello, hello.
- Hey, Sean.

669
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,807
Where are the kids?

670
00:39:34,927 --> 00:39:37,906
Annie is helping
Ramona to get ready, and...

671
00:39:38,224 --> 00:39:40,062
Connor is playing
with her nephews.

672
00:39:40,182 --> 00:39:41,136
Oh, good.

673
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:44,225
It's easier to do this
when they're not around.

674
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:46,039
What is this?

675
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:53,119
Sean...

676
00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:57,771
Thank you.
Thank you, Sean.

677
00:39:58,692 --> 00:40:00,513
This means so much to me.

678
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:02,542
Ok. Now we finally got that
out of our systems,

679
00:40:02,662 --> 00:40:04,099
can we please have
some fun around here?

680
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:06,105
- Uh, yes.
- Let's have some fun.

681
00:40:06,225 --> 00:40:08,300
Ok. Can I suggest
one final...

682
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,385
3-way?

683
00:40:09,505 --> 00:40:11,446
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, no.

684
00:40:12,317 --> 00:40:14,774
I mean this kind of 3-way.

685
00:40:15,577 --> 00:40:17,017
There you go, buddy.

686
00:40:18,497 --> 00:40:20,288
Our son's getting married.

687
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:23,081
Maybe we did something right
along the way or something like that.

688
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:24,821
- I'll drink to that.
- Or something.

689
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:26,632
I know.
Hard to believe.

690
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,431
Sean.
