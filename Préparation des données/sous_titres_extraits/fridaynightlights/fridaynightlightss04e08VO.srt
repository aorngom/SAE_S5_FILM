1
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:06,672
Son, you all right?

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,634
- God, contraction! {\Please }Go to the hospital.
- You're seven months pregnant...

3
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,636
She're going to need
to go on bed rest

4
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:14,805
- until the baby's full-term.
- I don't exactly have insurance{\ right now}.

5
00:00:15,144 --> 00:00:16,390
I'll figure out something.

6
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,517
{\I }Got an{\ obusiness} opportunity
that {\really }could make you{\ a} rich{\ man}.

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,085
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

8
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,521
I thought he was the one.

9
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,899
I know, sweetie.
I'm sorry, babe.

10
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,717
Do your thing, Skeeter.

11
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:28,653
That's pretty great.

12
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:30,655
Texas forever.

13
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:33,908
I think either one of them
says college interview.

14
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,868
This one still has a tag on it,
{\Might as well wear that one.It's }brand-new.

15
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:38,196
Honey,{\ you know} you've got
to put your toiletries

16
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:41,457
- into the plastic travel bag.
- These are ugly. I'm not bringing them.

17
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,435
- Have you seen my bright blue shirt?
- Gracie doesn't have any pants.

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,379
It's in with the dry cleaning.
Let me get it.

19
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,892
Do you know
where Gracie's pants are?

20
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:50,958
- Do you know where they{\ Gracie's pants} are?
- Hi, sweet angel.

21
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,636
They're in the bottom drawer.
Help your daddy find your pants.

22
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,054
The bottom drawer{\, sweetie}.

23
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,598
{\You realize }None of my outfits are gonna work
unless I have that shirt.

24
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,308
{\I'm }Getting it right now.
It's...

25
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,770
- They're not in the bottom drawer!
- Check the dryer. We can't miss this...

26
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,523
Come on, bring your spaceman.
I know, we got to get your pants on.

27
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:08,651
Mom, every outfit you packed
I look like a realtor in.

28
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,487
Hey, y'all need to pack up
and let's get going.

29
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,745
- {\You }Give 'em hell up there, {\you }understood{\ me}?
- See? You found the pants.{\ That's} Great.

30
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,200
- I know...
- Alright.

31
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,703
Time to go, you were five minutes late
five minutes ago.

32
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,705
- Bye.
- You'll{\re gonna} be great for your daddy.

33
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,249
Oh, shoot, I got to grab
my briefcase. One sec...

34
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:25,292
<i>And not that anybody cares,</i>

35
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,422
<i>but we have the league's two
last-place teams facing off this friday.</i>

36
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:32,996
<i>That's the East Dillon Lions
versus the Campo Park Timberwolves.</i>

37
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:35,511
<i>Now folks, some of you * this game</i>

38
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:39,248
<i>the toilet bowl and I cannot disagree,
but I tell you what,</i>

39
00:01:39,373 --> 00:01:42,435
<i>if you're coach Taylor,
you've got to see this game</i>

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,310
<i>as a singular opportunity
to get a "w" on the books this season.</i>

41
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,579
Hey, ma?

42
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:05,833
- Do I have a follow-up with the doctor?
- He said he didn't need to see you

43
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,419
unless it's still hurting
in a couple of weeks.

44
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,047
It's doing good{\, right}? {\I mean, }You've been going
to practice and everything.

45
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:14,133
Yeah.
No, I'm good.

46
00:02:14,497 --> 00:02:16,897
I've been driving
by this property...

47
00:02:18,184 --> 00:02:19,184
Yeah.

48
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,552
It doesn't have a price on there,
and I was...

49
00:02:25,456 --> 00:02:27,396
A steal.
$85,000.

50
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:31,567
$75,000 if you could pay
half the purchasing price upfront.

51
00:02:32,072 --> 00:02:33,651
Might that be an option?

52
00:02:46,578 --> 00:02:48,985
Hey, yeah, I know
that we hang out all the time...

53
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,348
Exactly.
So why we got to call it a date?

54
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:54,381
Because there's a very distinct
difference in just hanging out

55
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:55,966
and an actual date.

56
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,018
I would be wearing
a nice button-up shirt

57
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:01,847
and you would probably
be wearing, like, a nice skirt

58
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,861
or something like that.
{\And }It would be nighttime.

59
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:05,601
When you say a nice shirt, though,

60
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,937
you don't mean the one
with the periodic table?

61
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,809
I have other really nice shirts.

62
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:13,400
- I have a bunch of really nice shirts.
- Yeah...

63
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:16,821
- I have Wednesday night off.
- Perfect.

64
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,906
- Wednesday night?
- I love wednesdays.

65
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:21,513
That's great.
Good night.

66
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:23,188
- It's cool.
- Okay.

67
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:34,441
Full-pad Monday.
Everyone ought to be happy.

68
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:37,137
You know what, it doesn't matter
whether you win or lose,

69
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:39,927
it's how you play the game...
Who's heard that before?

70
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:43,305
Well, that doesn't apply
to this team anymore. Listen to me.

71
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,722
Individually, we ought to be damn proud
of where we come from

72
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:48,143
and where we are right now.

73
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,686
Collectively, I think we've got
a hell of a football team here.

74
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:54,324
But we're not scrappers anymore,

75
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:56,443
we're Lions.

76
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,705
And this is our time.

77
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:02,572
This is your time.

78
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,160
We got a week
for this game coming up.

79
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:08,720
I want you to know
I'm proud to take the field with you.

80
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:11,125
Let's practice.

81
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,570
What's going on?

82
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:43,620
4x08: TOILET BOWL

83
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,205
Subtitles: Team Lions
With the participation of:

84
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,751
Benj!, Collioure, DarKsh,
GillesSilb, Ju, Nam, Ouazo

85
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:08,800
So we have
a fabulous contradiction here.

86
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:10,619
Chaucer is the founder

87
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,540
{\pos(192,220)}of modern english poetry,
but he also uses words

88
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,667
like "ass" and "fart."

89
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:21,880
So what does Chaucer's very deliberate
use of language tell us?

90
00:06:23,238 --> 00:06:24,238
{\pos(192,230)}Anyone?

91
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:28,831
Someone?
Come on, really.

92
00:06:29,818 --> 00:06:31,019
Yes, ma'am?

93
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,364
Do you want to answer?

94
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:35,269
No, I'm just observing.

95
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:37,855
{\pos(192,230)}Oh, no, that's okay.
It seems you have a thought.

96
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,223
Please, share.

97
00:06:40,477 --> 00:06:43,944
{\pos(192,220)}Oh, well, would it have to do
with the context?

98
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:46,530
{\pos(192,220)}You know, who's speaking?

99
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:48,113
Exactly.

100
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:50,492
{\pos(192,220)}Context. Who's speaking.

101
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:53,839
{\pos(192,220)}Think about the knight's tale.

102
00:06:54,074 --> 00:06:55,748
{\pos(192,220)}A story of romantic love...

103
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,048
Let's see you throw it like that

104
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,759
without tipping off the safety
with your shoulders.

105
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,699
All right, looking good.

106
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:11,930
Looking good!

107
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,564
- Let's blitz.
- Here we go. Hit to hurt, gentlemen.

108
00:07:22,164 --> 00:07:23,984
Down the field.
That's it, that's it...

109
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:30,029
Fours, come here.

110
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:34,762
- You all right?
- Yeah.

111
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,955
You sure?
All right, let's go.

112
00:07:39,153 --> 00:07:41,126
{\pos(192,220)}Grab the ball, Luke.
Here we go.

113
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:50,928
{\pos(192,220)}Look what the cat drug in.

114
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,188
Ain't got any need
for a toilet, do you?

115
00:07:54,313 --> 00:07:57,684
No, I don't. I've never heard
such malarkey in my life. Hey, Eric.

116
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:59,603
{\pos(192,230)}- Good to see you.
- You too.

117
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,064
{\pos(192,220)}Joe, keep the elbow up.

118
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,866
"Toilet bowl", god help us.

119
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:08,070
{\pos(192,220)}I just want to tell you that I...

120
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,839
I used to be something

121
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:12,664
for the Dillon Panthers.

122
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,168
And I want to be that way here.

123
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:17,905
{\pos(192,220)}I can help you.

124
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,582
{\pos(192,220)}I'm gonna do that,
I just want to let you know that.

125
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:24,169
All right.

126
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,591
Keep your hands...

127
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:31,216
No, no, put it back.

128
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:43,772
{\pos(192,220)}Look, look.

129
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,275
We're gonna run a post-route
with the sunflower seeds. Go{\, go}.

130
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,612
Are you seriously teaching them
to throw food?

131
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,406
You can't teach that.
Great job.

132
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,939
{\a1}- What's wrong with you?
- That's talent.

133
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:58,287
{\pos(192,220)}Look at all you boys. I haven't seen you
in such a long time. You've grown!

134
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:00,998
Darius, did anybody tell you
you look more and more

135
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,708
- like your daddy?
- Yes, ma'am.

136
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:05,544
I bet they do.
You know, I tell you what,

137
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,088
I'm cooking dinner next week,
and I want you to be there.

138
00:09:10,203 --> 00:09:11,008
{\a1}Me?

139
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:14,136
Oh, no, I wouldn't want
to impose on...

140
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,557
No, you're not imposing.

141
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:19,199
I'm gonna cook for us,
and I expect you to be there, okay?

142
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:20,474
Final answer.

143
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,103
{\pos(192,210)}You boys be good now.
Listen to what she tells you to do,

144
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,230
{\a1}- okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

145
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:27,691
I'll see you.
Come on, baby.

146
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:30,569
Keep those.
Let 'em have the pancakes.

147
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,779
- Can I get the pancakes, please?
- No, you can't.

148
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:34,323
{\pos(192,220)}Stop. You hush.

149
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:41,454
{\pos(192,220)}Honestly, before you{\ were a guidance counselor}, I don't think we
got any applications from your district.

150
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:45,375
Well, you know, I think once y'all came
down to the fair, it just put a face

151
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,511
to the school and let the kids realize
it's not so far away,

152
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:50,558
and it's a real opportunity for 'em.

153
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:53,179
{\pos(192,220)}- {\Well, }I'm just so glad you came up to B.C.
- We are too.

154
00:09:53,304 --> 00:09:54,968
{\pos(192,220)}Julie, how do you like it so far?

155
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:58,775
{\pos(192,220)}- It looks exactly like the brochure.
- Beautiful.

156
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,058
Did you get a chance
to sit in on any classes?

157
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:04,436
- Yeah, an english class.
- Oh, great. How was it?

158
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:06,063
It was good.

159
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,797
It was great, we had so much fun.
It was professor Paulson's class.

160
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:11,109
Oh, Vanessa.

161
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:13,821
{\pos(192,220)}Her class is like being
at some fabulous dinner party.

162
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,491
It made me wanna read <i>The Canterbury
Tales,</i> just for fun all over again.

163
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,701
Jules loves to read too,
don't you, honey?

164
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:22,363
I think she got that from me.

165
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:23,997
This place is so gorgeous.

166
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:26,890
You have a big game
coming up this weekend.

167
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:28,928
What do you got to say about it?

168
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:31,695
All right...

169
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,689
Some chick named Mindy's
on the phone for you,

170
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:42,307
{\and }she sounds really crazy,
{\so }do you want me to just blow her off?

171
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,720
- No. Here.
- Hey, Skeeter.

172
00:10:48,173 --> 00:10:51,525
Hey, Tim, I can't get a hold of Billy,
and the toilet's backed up,

173
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,360
and I need you to get over here.

174
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,054
See, I've had a few too many,
so I can't drive.

175
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:00,022
Actually, this isn't
about you and your drinking problem.

176
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:02,327
It's about me and my baby,
and the toilet is toxic.

177
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,080
And I pee every five minutes.
And I don't know where your brother is,

178
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,166
- <i>and I really need you to be here.</i>
- So go in the bathtub.

179
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,585
<i>I{\'m not gonna} won't go in the bathtub!</i>

180
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,920
I am on bed rest.
Get your ass over here!

181
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:18,802
Can you drive stick?

182
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,162
Remember, the clutch
is your best friend, okay?

183
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:25,344
I'm not really sure what you mean
when you say that.

184
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:26,698
Just let...

185
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:28,437
You unders...

186
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,621
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,274
I don't have airbags, by the way.

188
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:36,365
Relax.

189
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:38,030
Relax...

190
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,930
So why were you in a suit today?

191
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:44,059
Oh, that's a good question.

192
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,514
Some guys aren't meant
to be in a suit,

193
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,039
and some guys are.

194
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:56,466
It's green.

195
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,384
The light's green.
Here we go.

196
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:01,970
Wrench me.

197
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:04,514
Where is Billy anyways?

198
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:07,047
Doing some big job down at the rig.

199
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:08,451
This late?

200
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:10,896
You didn't know that?

201
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:13,607
Yeah, I knew that.

202
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:18,145
He's been working
a lot of nights lately.

203
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,822
Yeah, well, it's getting busy, Min,

204
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,560
- which is a good thing.
- It's not a big deal, right?

205
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,215
- What do you mean?
- Like, if I call him,

206
00:12:27,837 --> 00:12:31,841
and he's all distracted,
and he's tired all the time, and...

207
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,170
if I walk into a room
and he's on the phone,

208
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,438
then he hangs up really quickly?

209
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:42,135
Mins, what you're saying
is not happening.

210
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:44,304
He is having an affair, isn't he?

211
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,587
No, he's not.

212
00:12:45,712 --> 00:12:48,517
I don't even want to know.
That's the sad part.

213
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,504
How pathetic am I?
I don't even want to know

214
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:53,063
if my husband's cheating on me
because I'm a total mess.

215
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,325
Yeah, I mean,
this is an emerging team.

216
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,537
Equals emerging opportunity.

217
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:19,297
He thinks you want free time.

218
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,526
I understand.
I'm a businessman, I understand that.

219
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:25,887
This is a new demographic for you...
Football.

220
00:13:26,587 --> 00:13:28,558
- Football.
- American football, yeah.

221
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,228
- No, no, I understood that.
- Buddy.

222
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,689
- American football.
- And I understand you.

223
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,233
<i>Uno momento.</i>
Yeah, what?

224
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,778
{\You think }This is truely necessary? If they wanna
talk trash about us, the hell with them.

225
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,550
- Let's just get out of here.
- I'm an investor. They understand that.

226
00:13:44,675 --> 00:13:47,718
This is a chance for us
to have a voice.

227
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:49,411
We can stop {\all }the trash talk

228
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,537
that's going on{\ out there}.
This can make a difference.

229
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:54,416
Do you think we can do this
within another 5 minutes maybe?

230
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,161
All right, just...
keep going.

231
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:57,461
- <i>Señor?</i>
- Yes.

232
00:13:58,102 --> 00:14:00,820
You say you want english
on a spanish station?

233
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:02,466
Just for the football games.

234
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:07,653
What the hell you doing?

235
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:10,602
- Mornin'.
- Yeah, morning.

236
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,682
You can be honest with me, man.

237
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:14,853
I'm just...
Are you messing around on Mindy?

238
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:17,716
No.

239
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:21,735
'Cause I know
you've been working late

240
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:25,238
and all that{\ kind of} stuff, and I was over there
and she's all worried and stressed out,

241
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,616
- and maybe...
- I'm not cheating on Mindy, all right?

242
00:14:28,182 --> 00:14:30,160
What's all this
late-night stuff then?

243
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:31,899
Just doing...

244
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:34,547
a little after-hours work,
that's all.

245
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,907
What kind of after-hours work?

246
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,551
{\You know, }It's the kind of after-hours work
that you can't really

247
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:42,255
do in the daytime, you get it?

248
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:46,635
No, Billy, I don't get it. That's why
I'm asking. What do you mean?

249
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:48,945
- After-hours...
- Okay.

250
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,181
A couple guys came to me
a couple weeks ago,

251
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:54,321
and they gave me
a little proposition, and...

252
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:56,196
What kind of proposition?

253
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,780
Once or twice a week,

254
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:01,900
they come by with a car, and I break
it down to its component parts.

255
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:05,041
They need it turned around
in a quick time,

256
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,988
- and they pay really well...
- Chop shop.

257
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:13,662
That's the stupidest...

258
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:16,706
Yeah, well, it's a plan, Tim.
You got a better plan?

259
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:18,562
Yeah, Billy.

260
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:22,337
We had a plan.
I mean, we just had a party here

261
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,589
- and raised buckets of money.
- Buckets of money?

262
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,092
- Where's all that money then{\, Billy}?
- {\Buckets of money. }You wanna know where it{\ that money} is{\, Tim}?

263
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,260
One meeting with a specialist.
That money's gone.

264
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,973
- {\You got }Any other plans, tell me about 'em.
- Yeah, Billy.

265
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:34,658
This!

266
00:15:35,156 --> 00:15:36,768
This was our plan, Billy!

267
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,588
Riggins' Rigs.

268
00:15:39,024 --> 00:15:41,022
- Tim, it's a temporary thing.
- Temporary thing...

269
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,692
- It's temporary.
- You have no idea what you're risking.

270
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,318
{\Look, }Nobody's getting hurt here, man.

271
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:49,490
You keep reminding me,
like, every week that you have a family,

272
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:52,794
and this mechanic shop
is some dream of yours.

273
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,104
That's the whole reason
I'm doing this, okay?

274
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:57,289
The whole reason
I'm doing this is for my family.

275
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,167
This is gonna prevent
me from going bankrupt.

276
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,837
It's gonna make sure that Mindy{\'s gonna be okay}
and {\that }my baby are gonna be okay.

277
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:08,247
All right? And once it's over with,
everything will go back to normal.

278
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:20,854
I love this school.

279
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:24,107
I know.
It's your favorite.

280
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:28,068
Did I ever tell you
this was my first-choice school?

281
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:29,696
Only, like, a million times.

282
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,573
But no pressure or anything, right?

283
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,241
What do you mean?
Of course, no pressure.

284
00:16:37,432 --> 00:16:39,623
You'd have disowned me
if I didn't apply to this college.

285
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:42,661
What are you talking about?

286
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:48,080
You've{\ just} been staring over my shoulder,
looking at every syllable

287
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:50,840
that I've put into every application
since I started the college process.

288
00:16:50,965 --> 00:16:53,533
Wait a minute.
You decided where you wanted to apply.

289
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:56,790
I have been trying to help you
in that process.

290
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:59,976
But, honey, it's up to you
what school you go to.

291
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:02,896
It's not up to me.
All I'm trying to do is...

292
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:06,453
Is support you as you're making
that decision, that's all.

293
00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:07,954
You get me?

294
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:12,431
You sure about that?

295
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,676
I can't hit that note.

296
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:41,935
I'm sorry.

297
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,096
- Is something the matter today{\, Landry}?
- No, I just couldn't hit that note...{\, and I got frustrated.}

298
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:48,692
- He got stood up.
- I did not get stood up, Jimmy!

299
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,820
Actually, the date was rescheduled
because of conflicts.

300
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:55,323
And that might be
a good thing, because...

301
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,493
thursday is more of,
like, a sexual night anyways.

302
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,850
So we're just gonna go through
the whole psychoanalytic breakdown?

303
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:03,998
No, I'm saying, by 7:00 P.M.

304
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,508
on thursday, your brain
has basically clicked in

305
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,588
that it's pretty much the weekend,
but wednesday's closer to monday,

306
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:13,007
and no one's getting
busy on monday, but...

307
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:14,341
Get busy?

308
00:18:16,743 --> 00:18:18,930
Every now and then,
people want to get busy.

309
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,784
Ms. Howard,
can I help you out in there?

310
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:27,750
Oh, no, no, no, you stay put.
I know you've been working hard.

311
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,604
- You need help with that?
- Oh, no, baby, I got it.

312
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,156
So, Jess, I must say
bless your heart for joining us

313
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:39,701
'cause I ain't never seen this boy
wear anything but a t-shirt.

314
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:42,087
How you been?

315
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,342
Well, you know, I can't complain.

316
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:48,084
Well, {\you know, }I lost my job down at the hotel,
but that was because it was closing

317
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,004
and whatnot, but, you know,
I'm keeping myself really busy, so...

318
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:54,466
I did some part-time work
for this...

319
00:18:55,276 --> 00:18:58,744
cleaning company, and, you know,
that just really didn't pan out.

320
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:02,182
I think it was just because of doing
the night school thing down at Tech.

321
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:05,188
- You know, things start changing...
- {\Mama, }These mashed potatoes are delicious.

322
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:07,054
Yeah, I know, baby.

323
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,606
- So I'm planning, and...
- That's good.

324
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:12,734
Yeah. My aunt said
to tell you hello.

325
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:15,463
She's working down at this...
for this new company...

326
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:19,022
You know what, honey?
Do you know how amazing you are?

327
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,091
I mean, do you know
how amazing you are?

328
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:26,960
'Cause, when you were a little girl,
I mean, this light would

329
00:19:27,178 --> 00:19:28,800
just shine through you.

330
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,418
And... now look at you.

331
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,671
You've become
a beautiful young woman.

332
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:36,966
- Thank you.
- Vincent, isn't she beautiful?

333
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,336
I mean, look at her.
Isn't she beautiful?

334
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:41,930
- Stop it.
- She's gorgeous.

335
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:49,107
Coach, you know you doomed,

336
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:51,564
unless you can come up
with some kind of passing game.

337
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:53,863
Hey, why don't you let
coach worry about his game?

338
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:57,163
Y'all need to worry about buying
some of this radio airtime.

339
00:19:57,352 --> 00:19:59,151
{\You know,}Buddy called me the other day.

340
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:01,411
That man is on a mission.

341
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:05,036
The roto-rooter talk's not
exactly morale-boosting, is it?

342
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,289
Who are you telling? I bought
60 seconds, I'm a damn preacher.

343
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:11,626
Hey, sure hope you make it
worth my while, come friday.

344
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:14,921
We'll do our best.
Hey, this is pretty good brisket here.

345
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:17,132
Thank you.
Now I can die happy.

346
00:20:18,442 --> 00:20:20,042
He's warming up to me.

347
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:25,617
Great.
The internet's not working.

348
00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:27,225
I'm sorry, honey.

349
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,427
Want to call downstairs?

350
00:20:38,014 --> 00:20:39,564
You all right, honey?

351
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:48,072
I know I should be excited
about this trip, and...

352
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,833
I know that we've been planning it
for a really long time, and it's...

353
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:54,665
Everything's just...

354
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,088
- Just happening so fast.
- I know.

355
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,100
I know it seems like it.

356
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:02,343
I know I'm letting you down.

357
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:07,053
No, ma'am.
Don't go there.

358
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:10,101
How could you be letting me down?

359
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,081
I feel like such a stupid mess.
Like, hi, here I am.

360
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,817
I got dumped, and I'm hanging out at all
these universities where I don't belong.

361
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,450
Of course you do.

362
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,029
You belong anywhere you want.

363
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:24,236
I don't know. It's like,
all these interviews, it's like...

364
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:26,957
I'm expected to recite
all these factoids about myself

365
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:29,635
and tell 'em how perfect I am
and why I'd be

366
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,860
a good student, and it's just...

367
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:35,627
It just seems fake.

368
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,809
Well, I'll tell you what.

369
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:46,805
The only thing you need to do
in all these interviews is go in

370
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,556
and just be you.

371
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:53,956
Just, you know,
look at this as an opportunity.

372
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:56,728
This is an opportunity
for your future.

373
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:58,439
It's exciting.

374
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:03,467
I'm gonna go take a shower.

375
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:19,732
Yo.
What's up, man?

376
00:22:19,857 --> 00:22:21,339
- What up, C?
- Chillin'.

377
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:22,775
Another day.

378
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:25,895
I know you hungry.
Go ahead and eat something.

379
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:28,361
What's up?

380
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,471
Getting kind of boring
stealing these cars without you.

381
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,130
I need my road dawg.

382
00:22:34,824 --> 00:22:36,183
I can't, man.

383
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:39,732
I wish I could, but, you know,
gotta study these plays, you know.

384
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,360
Right, right.
Plays, plays, yo.

385
00:22:45,913 --> 00:22:49,425
{\You know, }Ty and some of his boys are gonna
be down at the park hooping later, man.

386
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,353
You should{\ definitely} roll.
We could take 'em.

387
00:22:51,478 --> 00:22:55,187
I mean, you ain't that good, but{\, you know,} you
got me on your team, so we solid.

388
00:22:55,312 --> 00:22:56,165
Yeah, man.

389
00:22:57,164 --> 00:22:58,167
Can't do it.

390
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,546
Practice, you know.
Coach is on my butt about it, so...

391
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:04,697
Coach come first, huh?

392
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:06,926
All right.

393
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:11,535
It's not even like that, man. Listen,
look, we gonna be hanging real soon.

394
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,642
I just can't get caught up,
you know, my P.O.?

395
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:16,751
You know how it is.

396
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:18,654
Yeah, I know how it is, man.

397
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:20,622
All right.

398
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:31,014
Okay, so when you walk in,
you want to have a presence.

399
00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:33,703
- So smile... Are you paying attention?
- Yeah.

400
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:36,164
Walk tall, come in...

401
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:37,332
sit.

402
00:23:39,858 --> 00:23:43,337
With your shoulders pulled back, like
there's {\a beam of }energy coming out of your chest.

403
00:23:43,777 --> 00:23:46,132
I don't think I'm trying
to be a superhero here.

404
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,383
I just want a job.

405
00:23:48,168 --> 00:23:50,777
Okay, now, get up,
and let's do it from the beginning.

406
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:52,622
It's my turn.

407
00:23:53,846 --> 00:23:57,336
- Okay. You ready for this?
- I am so ready.

408
00:23:58,244 --> 00:23:59,244
Walk tall.

409
00:23:59,617 --> 00:24:00,961
Walking tall.

410
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:11,657
That's my resume, sir.

411
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:16,739
So, Mr. Riggins, I understand
you're applying for a job here.

412
00:24:16,864 --> 00:24:19,293
What kind of situation
are you looking for?

413
00:24:20,351 --> 00:24:23,801
I'm looking for a situation
where I can achieve something,

414
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:25,296
be proud of it,

415
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,337
and do it, start to finish,

416
00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:29,732
on my own.

417
00:24:32,608 --> 00:24:33,953
You know what I think?

418
00:24:34,426 --> 00:24:35,255
What?

419
00:24:36,372 --> 00:24:37,809
I think you're a strong person,

420
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,210
an honest worker,

421
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:43,005
and I think

422
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,150
you can grow up to be
whoever you want to be, Tim Riggins.

423
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:55,599
I'm guessing that's for you.

424
00:24:58,776 --> 00:25:00,180
What are you doing here?

425
00:25:00,305 --> 00:25:02,455
Just came to talk to Tim Riggins.

426
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:07,051
It's for you.

427
00:25:08,956 --> 00:25:10,430
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

428
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:11,374
Good.

429
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,005
Fours.

430
00:25:17,821 --> 00:25:19,421
What can I do you for?

431
00:25:21,427 --> 00:25:23,527
I got hurt real bad at the farm.

432
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:27,287
I{\ mean, i}t's like, when I push off
and when I get hit, it's like someone's

433
00:25:27,412 --> 00:25:29,235
trying to rip my leg off
with a crowbar.

434
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:31,998
What about the meds
the doc gave you?

435
00:25:32,123 --> 00:25:34,926
It's like three weeks of meds.
I went through 'em in one.

436
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:36,591
All right.

437
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:40,788
This is what I need you to do.{\, all right?}

438
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:42,422
Doctor Cooney.

439
00:25:42,737 --> 00:25:45,079
Mental note this, all right?
When you see him,

440
00:25:45,204 --> 00:25:47,795
first thing you got to do,
tell him how great he was at TMU.

441
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,424
Bring up your hip. And then there's
four questions, one-word answers.

442
00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:53,129
No,

443
00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:54,409
no,

444
00:25:54,876 --> 00:25:55,676
yes,

445
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,639
- no. That's it.
- All right.

446
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:00,266
Great.

447
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:04,604
Well, the joke is on you, Mr. Kangaroo,
for my sword

448
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,480
was dipped in poison.

449
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,281
Yay, thanks, Landry, for the story.

450
00:26:11,406 --> 00:26:13,696
- Now it's bedtime.
- What? Come on...

451
00:26:14,224 --> 00:26:15,990
Now be careful with those swords.

452
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:17,755
And start the...

453
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,370
You're trying to scare me.

454
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,039
Aren't you gonna kiss?

455
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,750
Go inside. Start the bath{\water}.

456
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,335
Vince is gonna kick your butt.

457
00:26:28,408 --> 00:26:31,214
He's gonna kick who's butt?
What did he say?

458
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:33,657
Jess likes the punter!

459
00:26:33,782 --> 00:26:35,420
She's gonna kiss him!

460
00:26:35,545 --> 00:26:36,839
Smoochy!

461
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:39,555
What'd he say about Vince?

462
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:43,030
I don't...
I don't know.

463
00:26:43,738 --> 00:26:45,297
I think they like...
Yeah.

464
00:26:45,422 --> 00:26:47,688
Either way,
I had a really good time tonight.

465
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,317
I did too.

466
00:26:58,009 --> 00:26:59,742
I'll see you tomorrow at school.

467
00:27:00,378 --> 00:27:02,245
- Thanks for the sword.
- Be careful.

468
00:27:02,918 --> 00:27:04,827
And for the story, that...

469
00:27:05,216 --> 00:27:06,216
Thanks.

470
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:07,446
All right.

471
00:27:07,571 --> 00:27:08,621
Good night.

472
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:20,819
Well, I got a toy...

473
00:27:23,093 --> 00:27:26,833
All right, it's a vegetarian place,
and it's around here somewhere.

474
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:29,434
It's supposed to be great.
I read a review about it.

475
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:32,065
Can't we just go back
and order room service?

476
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,307
What are you talking about?
This is gonna be fun.

477
00:27:35,857 --> 00:27:37,380
I just want to go back.

478
00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:40,616
Hey, hon, come here, come here,
come here, come here, listen.

479
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:42,910
I know you're sad
about Matt leaving,

480
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,632
and I am sorry for that.

481
00:27:44,885 --> 00:27:46,747
But we're here, all right?

482
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:49,571
This is a great opportunity for you.

483
00:27:49,696 --> 00:27:52,003
I just want to make sure
you're seeing the bigger picture.

484
00:27:52,946 --> 00:27:55,965
I don't know
what that big picture is.

485
00:27:57,023 --> 00:27:59,552
It's you, it's your life,
it's your future, it's...

486
00:28:00,004 --> 00:28:01,716
getting into the school
of your dreams.

487
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:04,056
You mean the school of your dreams.

488
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:07,602
Stop acting like you're here
because of me, like I've been

489
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,603
masterminding your applications
and all that.

490
00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:12,605
You've always wanted to go
to a great school your whole life.

491
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,097
I am just here to support you.
You get that?

492
00:28:15,222 --> 00:28:17,737
Well, I'm sorry I'm not giving you
the command performance

493
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,155
that you deserve.

494
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:22,241
You got an opportunity tomorrow. You can
either show up and be your best self,

495
00:28:22,665 --> 00:28:25,578
or you can just blow it off{\, but I promise you, if you blow it off } because of
a break-up, you are gonna regret that.

496
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:27,496
So what do you want me to do?

497
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,415
I want you to pull
it together, girl.

498
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,917
- {\Yeah, well,}I'm trying to pull it together, okay?
- Well, try harder!

499
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,461
Try harder?

500
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:34,433
Yes.

501
00:28:37,946 --> 00:28:39,300
Thanks for your support, mom.

502
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,901
Jules, come...
Jules, come here.

503
00:28:42,026 --> 00:28:43,026
Come here.

504
00:28:46,153 --> 00:28:48,061
We were assigned
a christmas memory last year,

505
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:51,315
and, after that, I started reading
all of Capote's short stories.

506
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,646
They're really great.

507
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,068
{\Well, }That's impressive.

508
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:55,871
You know what I think
is really amazing?

509
00:28:55,996 --> 00:28:58,432
Is that he and Harper Lee
were best friends.

510
00:28:58,557 --> 00:29:02,114
That in a little town, two great artists
found each other when they were kids.

511
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:05,575
I never thought of it that way.

512
00:29:06,236 --> 00:29:07,286
Now, Julie,

513
00:29:07,738 --> 00:29:10,782
is there anything else you wanna say
about yourself, something that...

514
00:29:10,907 --> 00:29:13,084
we wouldn't pick up
from reading your transcript?

515
00:29:19,246 --> 00:29:21,096
When I started high school,

516
00:29:22,598 --> 00:29:24,576
I couldn't wait
to get out of Dillon.

517
00:29:24,701 --> 00:29:28,011
I thought that every book I read
was like a rung on a ladder

518
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:29,791
that I built to escape this town

519
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:33,104
that was all about high school football
and nothing else.

520
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:40,152
And now that I'm actually
getting close to leaving,

521
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:44,115
I'm starting to appreciate that...

522
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:46,836
I was shaped by my town,

523
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:52,972
that I have different viewpoint
than every other person.

524
00:29:54,054 --> 00:29:56,654
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that...

525
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:02,832
I'm surprised by how happy I am
to be from where I'm from.

526
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:06,887
Does that make any sense?

527
00:30:08,752 --> 00:30:09,902
Yes, it does.

528
00:30:14,122 --> 00:30:16,838
- Thanks for coming in.
- {\Well, }I appreciate you taking the meeting.

529
00:30:16,963 --> 00:30:18,325
- Absolutely.
- Great.

530
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,428
So anything you want to add
before we're done?

531
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:22,096
Resume seems pretty up-to-date

532
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:25,030
and, I mean, the state champ
is on there and stuff.

533
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,198
{\That was }Impressive, man.

534
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,978
I know I could really come
into this kind of workplace

535
00:30:29,103 --> 00:30:30,536
and have a sense of achievement.

536
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,747
{\Well, }Tim, I think you'd be
a good fit here.

537
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,707
Awesome. Great.

538
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:38,294
And so we'll be in touch.

539
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:41,756
You take care.

540
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:44,603
You too.

541
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,234
So?

542
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:05,219
Is that you asking me how it went?

543
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:06,655
I mean, you know,

544
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:10,075
I'm not pressuring you.
You tell me if you want to tell me.

545
00:31:10,614 --> 00:31:11,702
It went well.

546
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,079
Good.

547
00:31:15,132 --> 00:31:16,182
Actually...

548
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:20,920
It went great. And I went in there,
and I totally kicked ass.

549
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,510
I'm so proud of you.

550
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:30,391
But you know what, hon?

551
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:33,383
You know I'd be proud of you
no matter what, right?

552
00:31:33,965 --> 00:31:36,415
- I know.
- And this whole thing about

553
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:38,604
the fact
that I applied to this school...

554
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:42,191
- I know, I know. It's your dream.
- No, honey, honey, that's the thing.

555
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:43,778
I got my dream.

556
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:46,612
I went to a good school,

557
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:48,239
I got the degree I wanted,

558
00:31:48,748 --> 00:31:49,998
I met your dad,

559
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:52,191
and I had you.

560
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:54,620
You're my dream, baby.

561
00:31:56,908 --> 00:31:58,040
I got what I wanted.

562
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,358
I got it all.

563
00:32:03,537 --> 00:32:06,347
And now it's your job to dream up
whatever you want,

564
00:32:06,472 --> 00:32:09,972
and I will support you
to the ends of the earth to do that.

565
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:21,333
Our plane's not till tonight.
We could go to a museum or...

566
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:24,775
go get a hot fudge sundae
and celebrate.

567
00:32:26,295 --> 00:32:27,595
Could we just...

568
00:32:28,886 --> 00:32:29,886
go home?

569
00:32:31,922 --> 00:32:33,472
Sure we can, sweetie.

570
00:32:42,268 --> 00:32:44,318
You allergic to any medication?

571
00:32:45,602 --> 00:32:46,702
Use alcohol?

572
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:51,135
You ever try
any over-the-counter medications?

573
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:52,528
Yes.

574
00:32:53,245 --> 00:32:55,093
They do any good for the pain?

575
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:00,737
Who's gonna win the BCS?

576
00:33:01,973 --> 00:33:03,022
TMU, sir.

577
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:07,610
At least your head's
in the right spot.

578
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:10,463
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

579
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:11,655
Good luck tonight.

580
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,656
They said I came close,

581
00:33:13,781 --> 00:33:15,281
whatever that means.

582
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:19,743
And they'll of course
keep the resume close by.

583
00:33:20,126 --> 00:33:21,457
So you never know.

584
00:33:22,563 --> 00:33:24,663
There's no accounting for taste.

585
00:33:25,802 --> 00:33:27,311
That's what my mom always says.

586
00:33:27,436 --> 00:33:29,686
I've heard that a few times myself.

587
00:33:35,986 --> 00:33:37,436
So this is it, huh?

588
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,970
This is it.

589
00:33:45,813 --> 00:33:46,956
It's beautiful.

590
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:48,281
You know what?

591
00:33:49,074 --> 00:33:51,121
I didn't want that job anyways.

592
00:33:55,365 --> 00:33:57,933
See those trees right there?
That little ridge?

593
00:33:58,058 --> 00:33:59,654
That's where the house is gonna go.

594
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:02,665
And then I want that deck
that goes all the way around.

595
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:03,814
A wraparound.

596
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:06,510
Maybe even a little guest house.
You never know.

597
00:34:06,635 --> 00:34:08,332
You see the tree line right there,

598
00:34:08,457 --> 00:34:10,714
I mean, I've walked this property
a few times,

599
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,704
and it goes way, way beyond that...

600
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:16,441
It's endless.

601
00:34:19,845 --> 00:34:20,849
I wanted to...

602
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,080
I wanted to thank you...

603
00:34:28,582 --> 00:34:30,182
for helping me with...

604
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,020
the process.

605
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:36,192
So...

606
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:39,146
Thank you.

607
00:34:57,872 --> 00:34:58,872
I'm sorry.

608
00:35:18,457 --> 00:35:20,784
Welcome, folks, and all the fans
of the East Dillon Lions.

609
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:24,163
We invite you tonight
to the radio debut of Lions football

610
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:27,750
on 1040 A.M, El Fuego.

611
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:31,631
<i>Now over to my partner
and your play-by-play man Willie Gault.</i>

612
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:34,381
Thank you, Buddy Garrity,
and thank you to all you fans

613
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,884
<i>who tuned in to hear a game
that has been given</i>

614
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,552
<i>a very special billing...</i>

615
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,762
The toilet bowl.

616
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,347
- One, two, three!
- Lions!

617
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:07,669
<i>There's the snap,
he's looking left...</i>

618
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:09,879
<i>No place to run.
He cuts up the middle.</i>

619
00:36:10,004 --> 00:36:12,154
<i>It's a little late. Makes a move.</i>

620
00:36:14,392 --> 00:36:15,392
Touchdown!

621
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:18,050
There we go, there we go!

622
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:21,178
And the Lions draw first blood.

623
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,596
<i>What an impressive first series
that coach Eric Taylor</i>

624
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,491
<i>has designed here
in East Dillon tonight.</i>

625
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:30,729
I tell you what, Vince Howard
is gunned up, he is yoked up,

626
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,040
<i>and he is playing like he's been playing
quarterback his whole life.</i>

627
00:36:34,165 --> 00:36:36,735
And this touchdown
was brought to you

628
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,609
by El Amigo restaurant.

629
00:36:47,381 --> 00:36:49,631
<i>Vince Howard comes
back out in the spread.</i>

630
00:36:49,756 --> 00:36:52,084
<i>He's got his a back setup
in the slot.</i>

631
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:54,924
<i>Rolling right to throw back.</i>

632
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,520
<i>Beautiful pass!</i>

633
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,893
<i>He overthrew him. It's incomplete.</i>

634
00:37:10,568 --> 00:37:13,013
<i>Would you look
at the gun on that kid?</i>

635
00:37:13,138 --> 00:37:17,442
Howard has just thrown the ball.
It looks like 60 yards, Willie.

636
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,945
<i>9 seconds left in the half,
fourth down.</i>

637
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:21,780
Landry! Field goal.

638
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:25,367
- But it's on the 25 yard line.
- I know where{\ the hell} we are. Just go kick{\ the damn thing}.

639
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,785
Go, Landry, go!

640
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:48,891
Ladies and gentlemen, Landry Clarke
has hit a very long field goal.

641
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,926
<i>East Dillon Lions go into halftime
with a 17 to 7 lead.</i>

642
00:38:13,895 --> 00:38:15,895
You scared the crap out of me.

643
00:38:17,925 --> 00:38:19,338
What's with the monkey suit?

644
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:34,478
How much money are we talking about?

645
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,610
I don't want you involved in this.

646
00:38:42,093 --> 00:38:42,903
How much?

647
00:38:47,072 --> 00:38:50,160
You'll make more money in two months
than you could in two years.

648
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:52,319
Two months?

649
00:38:53,062 --> 00:38:54,312
Two months max.

650
00:39:05,883 --> 00:39:07,678
<i>It's 17-7, East Dillon,</i>

651
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,930
and the way the Lions
have been playing tonight,

652
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,974
<i>I hope coach Taylor
can keep things going.</i>

653
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,183
Go on one. Ready?

654
00:39:13,574 --> 00:39:16,853
<i>Howard over center. There's the snap.
He's looking left.</i>

655
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,690
<i>Under pressure, throws the ball.
It's picked off!</i>

656
00:39:20,544 --> 00:39:21,994
What are you doing?

657
00:39:22,553 --> 00:39:24,528
<i>Timberwolves have it.
Going the other way!</i>

658
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,864
<i>The pack on the move.
Touchdown, Timberwolves.</i>

659
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,373
You know what, a good quarterback
has got a short memory.

660
00:39:44,987 --> 00:39:47,266
<i>Cafferty's looking for a place to go.
There's nowhere to run.</i>

661
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:49,636
<i>And Cafferty gets swarmed
by the Timberwolf team.</i>

662
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,683
<i>Oh, my, fumble! Campo picks it up.
Looks like reservations for six.</i>

663
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:56,059
<i>Touchdown, Timberwolves!</i>

664
00:39:58,184 --> 00:40:00,105
Another Timberwolf touchdown.

665
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:03,859
This cannot be.
The Lions are down now 21-17.

666
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,610
