1
00:00:09,848 --> 00:00:11,964
That's why I'm here, Coach.
My boy, J.D,

2
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:14,926
he is the real deal.
He is a great quarterback

3
00:00:15,186 --> 00:00:17,095
and I want him mentored
by a great coach.

4
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:21,682
And that is why I moved my family
to Dillon, Texas.

5
00:00:21,943 --> 00:00:24,538
If you only did what you wanted to do
your life'd be all about football,

6
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,103
beer and sex, wouldn't it?

7
00:00:26,273 --> 00:00:29,190
- What's the problem with that?
- Letter of interest from Oklahoma.

8
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,318
You didn't tell me
you were getting interest from colleges.

9
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,319
We're talking about
the rest of your life.

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,449
And maybe, if you're really nice to me,
I might give you a ride to school.

11
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:42,662
Will you marry me?

12
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:20,626
Damn, let's call it.
Women can eat.

13
00:01:20,996 --> 00:01:23,220
And you, what the hell
are you doing ordering a Bronco?

14
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,456
- That's like a $30 steak, man.
- Do you want to remind your soul mate

15
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:30,361
not to point out to everyone in the
restaurant who she gave a lap dance to?

16
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:32,712
Kinda made Lyla feel uncomfortable.

17
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:36,216
- You're so whipped, it's pathetic.
- Where are we, anyways?

18
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:38,813
I got a business meet.

19
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,083
What do you mean?
What kind of business meet?

20
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:45,188
Gotta get us a little scratch together.
Get us out of this hole.

21
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:49,036
If we're so broke, why do you keep
picking up all these checks, Trump?

22
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:52,064
What do you want me to do, dumbass?
Have my fiancee's mom paid for it?

23
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:55,026
- Why not?
- See, you're an idiot, that's why not.

24
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:56,777
Hey, Lou, how are you doing?

25
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,863
How about next time you call?

26
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:03,156
Who is he?

27
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:04,968
It's my brother.

28
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:08,565
Don't worry about him, man, he's cool,
he ain't gonna say nothing to anyone.

29
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:12,877
Wait out here.

30
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:24,388
Watch the target.

31
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,016
Keep it coming.
Roll around, roll around.

32
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:29,560
- That's it.
- How long has he looked that good?

33
00:02:29,822 --> 00:02:32,855
I'll tell you, Wade has made
a great difference in J.D's game.

34
00:02:33,138 --> 00:02:35,983
Arnett Mead's gonna be coming after you.
They're gonna be making it personal.

35
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,592
You stay light on your feet,
read the blitz, keep the tone up.

36
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:41,833
- You're gonna be fine.
- Yes, sir.

37
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:43,658
Line 'em up. Don't hit one.

38
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:46,410
- Good job, really good.
- Thank you, Coach.

39
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:50,373
Hey, they flew that coach down
from Dallas with him.

40
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:51,666
Square fire.

41
00:02:53,914 --> 00:02:55,050
Hey, Buddy.

42
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:58,936
You listen to me.

43
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,386
That is not my quarterback, you're
my quarterback, you understand that?

44
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,097
I want you concentrated on Friday night.

45
00:03:06,873 --> 00:03:09,473
You go out there and you play with what
we've taught you, what you know.

46
00:03:09,643 --> 00:03:11,666
Everything is gonna go just fine.

47
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:14,972
- Yes, sir.
- Go warm-up the arm.

48
00:03:15,222 --> 00:03:16,471
Let's go.

49
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:18,609
Let's go gentlemen, bring it up.

50
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:20,001
Hey, Coach.

51
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:23,563
Thanks for letting us use the field
earlier, I really appreciate that.

52
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:26,158
All right, circle it up.

53
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,198
Didn't know you were gonna
bring along cheerleading section.

54
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,415
They just want to see him
throw the ball, you know...

55
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:35,658
I know everyone is talking about
switching to the spread offense

56
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:39,831
for that Arnett Mead game and I want you
to know I support your decision 100%.

57
00:03:42,183 --> 00:03:44,135
- I appreciate that.
- But...

58
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,191
I also want you to know
that if you do decide

59
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,932
to switch to the spread, J.D. is ready.

60
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
J.D. will light it up.

61
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:54,715
You know what?

62
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:59,650
I only got these boys until 8.
How about you clear those cones off?

63
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,621
Sure enough.

64
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,404
Let's go, gentlemen, stretch it out.

65
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:07,158
3x03: HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES

66
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:12,204
Subtitles: Team Panthers

67
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,373
With the participation of:

68
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:19,462
benj!, DarKsh, GillesSilb,
Ju, loky34, ouazo, Teardrop

69
00:04:51,754 --> 00:04:54,413
Buddy, I don't give two farts
about the booster's anxiety,

70
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:56,711
I'm not gonna choose my quarterback
by committee.

71
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:59,571
I don't even know why
we're having this conversation.

72
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:03,575
Fine, you tell 'em that it is gonna be
my decision. End of conversation. Done.

73
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:04,788
Goodbye.

74
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:07,680
What's wrong with people?

75
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,430
Tell me about it.
I gotta throw a party for them.

76
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,282
We win first 2 games this season
and everyone is breathing down my neck.

77
00:05:13,452 --> 00:05:15,604
You think 200 cups is gonna be enough?

78
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,688
You know that Joe McCoy spends
thousands of dollars a month on his son

79
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:22,233
- for a quarterback coach.
- Thousand of dollars is what this party

80
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:24,890
- is gonna cost us.
- Did Julie take the keys again?

81
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,790
Maybe next year we could think about
not having this party at our house.

82
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:33,377
- What are you talking about?
- I don't think our house is big enough.

83
00:05:33,604 --> 00:05:36,706
And those boys are slobs, they get
the corn chips all over the floor,

84
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,770
they clog my toilet,
they break my things.

85
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,940
- At this point, it's a lot of work.
- Listen to me, I understand, please.

86
00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:47,468
Look...

87
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:50,509
Next year, I promise...

88
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:53,401
Maybe, we'll have it
somewhere else, all right?

89
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:56,236
Did I tell you
how sexy you look today?

90
00:05:57,043 --> 00:05:59,335
Did I tell you that
you're the best friend,

91
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:02,523
mother, and lover
that a man has ever had?

92
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:11,324
I need your truck,
I have to pick up your ribs.

93
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:14,673
You can have my truck
as soon as you can find the keys.

94
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:17,580
So, you think I should call him?

95
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:20,166
No, don't call him.

96
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:22,168
You're supposed
to let him come to you.

97
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:24,420
You got to get your head
on straight.

98
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:27,638
I mean, the Smash ain't gonna be around
to give all his free advice.

99
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,177
- You're just nervous about next week.
- Smash don't get nervous.

100
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:32,826
He gets ready.

101
00:06:38,156 --> 00:06:39,444
She's not here.

102
00:06:41,137 --> 00:06:44,543
Miss, time to get up from there,
come on help me. Get up your butt and...

103
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:47,331
I think you got the wrong information
'cause my mom already has a job.

104
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:49,510
What are you doing?
Give me this phone.

105
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,837
This is she.

106
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:56,129
Yeah, Saturday would be just fine.

107
00:06:56,593 --> 00:06:58,109
All right, bye-bye.

108
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:00,758
What was that all bout?

109
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:03,552
- You're taking another job?
- Yes, it's no big deal.

110
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:05,503
Just some home health care
on the weekend.

111
00:07:05,855 --> 00:07:08,297
- Like changing bedpans?
- What do you think nurses do?

112
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,511
Sit around and flirt
with doctors all day?

113
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:12,303
Why are you taking a second job?

114
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,844
Well, you're going to A&M,
who's gonna pay for this?

115
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:17,598
- No, mama...
- No, no mama nothing.

116
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:20,231
It's just a situation, baby.
We're gonna make it work.

117
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,605
Bring the rest of these groceries
so I can get this dinner started, baby.

118
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:27,483
No, I ordered 20 racks of ribs. Not 2.

119
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,443
I had somebody special on the phone.

120
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:31,904
- I don't know anything about it.
- I talked to a woman.

121
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:35,992
Maybe it... Could that be her? I'm sure
there must be somebody around here...

122
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,953
Excuse me, I just need
2 New York Strips. Real fast!

123
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:43,213
You know what? Can we get through this?
Sorry, I'm in the middle of something.

124
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:46,252
I'm telling you, I only have
2 racks of ribs, lady.

125
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:48,808
Don't call me lady, I hate that.
Thanks so much.

126
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:50,923
I did speak to somebody.
Is there another woman?

127
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:53,297
{\- Maybe you got some pounds in the back.
- }I'm gonna check in the back.

128
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:55,697
- Either way, anything will work for me.
- You got it.

129
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:56,971
Atkins diet?

130
00:07:57,937 --> 00:07:59,759
It made me real cranky, too.

131
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,559
- Sorry, I don't...
- Never mind.

132
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:04,478
You're principal Taylor,
I'm Katy McCoy.

133
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:07,464
My son goes to your school.

134
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:10,066
- Oh, J.D, right.
- Yeah.

135
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:13,946
Nice to meet you. I'm sorry if I was
a little rude, I got to get those ribs.

136
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:16,866
No, you're kidding, I think it's hot.
I like a woman

137
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:18,511
that speaks her mind.
I do.

138
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:21,527
You know what?
Speaking of which, I'd like to come by,

139
00:08:21,697 --> 00:08:23,912
visit with you
and talk about getting involved.

140
00:08:24,082 --> 00:08:26,473
- What do you want get involved in?
- I would like my son to go

141
00:08:26,643 --> 00:08:29,629
to a school that has enough books,
maybe even a music program.

142
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,915
I know, you and me both
but you know, it's...

143
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:34,540
There's a money issue,
you know, so it's...

144
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,386
That's what I mean
about getting involved.

145
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:40,854
See we got a little bit of money
and I'd like to give some of that away.

146
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:43,107
But I also love to throw parties, right?

147
00:08:43,277 --> 00:08:45,837
And get other people to come
and give some of their money away.

148
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:48,734
I'm a connector... Ever read
The Tipping Point of Malcolm...

149
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,734
- What's his name?
- I don't think...

150
00:08:51,994 --> 00:08:53,737
A connector{\ is somebody
who} knows everyone

151
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:55,982
and brings them all together
to get things done.

152
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:57,827
- Neat!
- Yeah, that's me.

153
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,662
Now what's a little thing like you
doing with 20 racks of ribs?

154
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:06,874
It's a long story... You know...
My husband...

155
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:09,858
Don't make it obvious.

156
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,089
Seven o'clock.

157
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:13,778
Creep.

158
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:17,560
Don't make it obvious.

159
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,466
Tim, stop it.

160
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,306
Seriously, I can't focus.

161
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,642
- It's a library.
- I know it's a library.

162
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:30,314
- You win, buddy. He wins.
- No, wait, Tim, stop.

163
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:32,024
Please?

164
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:34,628
You're gonna work
on this thing and...

165
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:37,488
you're gonna ace this test and...

166
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:41,619
you're gonna improve your grades
and you're gonna get a scholarship.

167
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:44,384
And we're gonna go to colleges

168
00:09:44,554 --> 00:09:47,341
that are really close to each other.

169
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,915
You are coming over
tomorrow night, correct?

170
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:53,504
- Mindy and Angela are gonna be there.
- OK, no Mindy, what... No.

171
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,383
I don't know if you notice or not,
but Mindy and Angela hate me.

172
00:09:58,843 --> 00:09:59,970
What?

173
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:02,257
They don't hate you.

174
00:10:02,723 --> 00:10:05,391
They don't even know you.
If they did, they'd love you.

175
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:08,225
And you know what?

176
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:09,742
Somebody...

177
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:13,065
wants his girlfriend to be there.

178
00:10:13,494 --> 00:10:15,276
Okay? And you know what?

179
00:10:15,536 --> 00:10:18,592
If they even look at you wrong,
and you don't see it and I do?

180
00:10:18,796 --> 00:10:21,623
I'm gonna blindsight them
with the worst...

181
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:23,973
block they'll have ever seen.

182
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:28,039
So, what I want...
from you right now

183
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:31,070
is for you to say,
"Yes, Tim,

184
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,038
"I can't wait to see you and hang out
with you tomorrow night."

185
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:36,075
Just... That's what I want from you.

186
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:38,340
So... Just give me that much.

187
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:41,576
Perfect.

188
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,779
Okay, really? Still...
You're still...

189
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:51,349
- Honey?
- Hey, babe.

190
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,779
Hey, honey.
Guess what?

191
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:56,313
I just met Katy McCoy

192
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:58,861
at the grocery store.
You know, Joe McCoy's wife.

193
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,822
And she is so nice.

194
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:05,304
I think she's gonna be really
a great asset to Dillon.

195
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:08,996
And the best part is, she has agreed
to do the whole barbecue at their house.

196
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:10,256
Done and done.

197
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:12,431
Don't eat those sad beans.
I bought Marcello's.

198
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:15,836
I don't want Marcello's.
What is it you said about the barbecue?

199
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:18,474
I was telling her
how difficult it's been,

200
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,179
how much work it's been
and how I don't have time for it.

201
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:24,136
And she said:
"Why don't I take it off your hands?"

202
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:28,538
Explain something to me.
How can we be a host...

203
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:32,101
of our barbecue at their house?
Isn't the definition of hosting

204
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:34,731
when you have something
at your own house?

205
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:37,566
Well... I think it's like co-hosting.

206
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,444
What the hell is co-hosting?
This is my barbecue.

207
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,490
It's funny that you say that.
I've been the one doing all the work.

208
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:46,590
But...
You know...

209
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:49,745
This time of the year,
there's a lot of scrutiny going on

210
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:51,872
I can tell you that I don't plan to be

211
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:54,792
in someone else's house being
scrutinized. I wanna be right here.

212
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:58,073
- Right here.
- You are not the only one

213
00:11:58,243 --> 00:11:59,964
who has been scrutinized.

214
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:03,107
And I frankly would rather
not be scrutinized in my own house.

215
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:05,461
This reaction surprises me.
This morning you said

216
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:07,488
we could do the barbecue
somewhere else.

217
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:10,812
Next year we could. I was telling you
what you wanted to hear, anyway.

218
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:13,603
And as far as this barbecue...
It's not just important to me.

219
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:17,371
It's a symbol of trust
to have the kids over here at the house

220
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,712
so they can be in our home
and feel welcome.

221
00:12:19,882 --> 00:12:22,775
And you're being played right now
and you don't even realize it.

222
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:24,951
That is silly.
I don't even know what that means.

223
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:27,545
I tell you what it means.
It means scotch, cigars,

224
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:29,949
Now they got the party.
And the next thing you know

225
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:32,330
we are gonna be indebted to them.
I don't want that.

226
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:34,516
That's what I'm saying.

227
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:37,814
I'm not being played.

228
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,463
She's nice.

229
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,833
Set!

230
00:12:49,383 --> 00:12:50,383
Blue 8!

231
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:52,183
Hut!

232
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:56,187
Oh, come on, Matt.

233
00:13:00,936 --> 00:13:03,235
- Come on, now. Spread release.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:13:04,872 --> 00:13:06,529
Square, baby!
There it is!

235
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,754
What are you doing?

236
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:10,431
Matt!

237
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:13,079
What you short-arming it for?
Loosen up.

238
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,291
Let's loosen up out here
and have some fun!

239
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,471
Come on, let's have some fun out here
and play some football!

240
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,050
Maybe we ought to get little JD
a few reps just in case.

241
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:27,182
Matt will take the reps.

242
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:30,261
- I'm just saying...
- Matt will take the reps.

243
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:32,555
It's my job, like you, too.

244
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:35,089
I'm not looking forward to U-haul

245
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:38,062
for sales signs at my yard
if we loose, too. You know what I mean?

246
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:42,148
Well, I'll bear that in mind, Mac.

247
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,259
Fine.

248
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:53,294
I'm trying to fight
this media machine JD McCoy.

249
00:13:53,636 --> 00:13:55,499
He's got like a 3-page spread in there.

250
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,997
Well, it's the freshmen preview.
So that makes sense.

251
00:13:58,391 --> 00:13:59,500
People like this.

252
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,795
- I don't wanna hear...
- But look, you don't have an angle.

253
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,464
Can you please just go away?
Go away, just leave.

254
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:09,376
So people know who you are,
and know what you gonna bring.

255
00:14:09,546 --> 00:14:13,185
I'm just trying to help you.
His angle is that he's young, he's new.

256
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:14,515
I don't need an angle.

257
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:16,864
Who cares? No one cares.
He's not hip.

258
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:20,542
He's not hip. You heard him talk?
He's not hip. Hello how are you?

259
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:22,889
- I'm OK.
- I don't care.

260
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:24,729
I'll leave this here.
If you want to...

261
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,733
I'm gonna get a Coke.
Julie, how are you doing?

262
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:29,976
- Doing good?
- I'm good.

263
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:31,899
- See you later.
- Bye.

264
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,036
What's up with him?

265
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,198
He's an idiot.
He's stupid.

266
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:40,416
Half eaten tacos!

267
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:42,208
Those are all yours right there.

268
00:14:42,637 --> 00:14:44,404
He won't mind.
He doesn't want them.

269
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:46,267
I'm pretty good.

270
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:52,606
So...

271
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:55,736
Big game, Friday?

272
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:57,390
It's huge.

273
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,044
Enormous.

274
00:15:02,214 --> 00:15:04,565
Yeah, it might alter my life,
in fact.

275
00:15:07,381 --> 00:15:08,444
Bad subject matter?

276
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,705
It's not...
This is...

277
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:14,579
I'm starting to worry about
beating Arnett Mead on Friday.

278
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:17,248
That's all I wanna be thinking about.
And that's hard.

279
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:20,447
I don't know if you're aware.
But we never beat Arnett Mead.

280
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:24,016
Not even Jason Street
ever beat Arnett Mead. Ever!

281
00:15:24,186 --> 00:15:25,596
I'm trying to worry about that.

282
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:29,766
Meantime, I've got some freshman named
Joe Doyle breathing down my neck.

283
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:33,966
If I hear anyone talk about this
70-yard pass he threw, ever again,

284
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:36,679
I'm gonna loose it, because...
I don't even care, he was in practice.

285
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:39,962
There wasn't defenders.
I can throw a ball 70 yards

286
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:43,644
when no one is running at me.
It's hard to do...

287
00:15:43,814 --> 00:15:46,727
- Sorry, you don't care about this.
- No! I do care. I asked.

288
00:15:46,897 --> 00:15:50,401
No, you shouldn't.
I'm just ranting. I apologize.

289
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:53,308
You're really adorable when you rent.

290
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,373
Thanks.

291
00:15:58,317 --> 00:15:59,957
Are you gonna eat your tacos?

292
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,289
I didn't come over here to eat tacos.

293
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:18,514
Brian, they told me
I'd probably find you back here.

294
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:21,236
Hey, Mr. Pollid.
What's up?

295
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:23,059
I came here to see you.

296
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:26,854
I was wondering if you thought
about a future with Alamo Freeze.

297
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:33,285
Honestly, sir.
No, I have not.

298
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:37,280
We're impressed with you.
You're smart, you're reliable.

299
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,443
The employees like you.
The management likes you.

300
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:44,954
And the company is expanding.
We're opening 4 new stores.

301
00:16:45,908 --> 00:16:48,844
And we need a regional manager
to oversee them.

302
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,547
Well, sir...
I don't know...

303
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:54,632
It's a $10,000 raise to start.

304
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:58,479
Plus bonuses and a company car.
Brand new.

305
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:00,155
For real?

306
00:17:02,346 --> 00:17:04,195
Think about it.
Think about it.

307
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:06,923
I think it's just
a really good fit for both of us.

308
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:09,010
All right?

309
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:11,793
- All right. We'll see you.
- Hey, thanks.

310
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,222
Let's have a margarita bar
around the pool.

311
00:17:15,392 --> 00:17:17,532
- We all should have some fun.
- Amen to that.

312
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:18,763
I love that idea.

313
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:21,619
Maybe we could play some silly games
like "Toss the orange".

314
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,787
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hi, hon.

315
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,697
- This is Katy McCoy, my husband Eric.
- Nice to meet you.

316
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:31,854
Pleasure to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

317
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:33,955
Pleasure to meet you as well.

318
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,355
As far as the games
and the barbecue and everything,

319
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:39,242
I mean just to let you know that
the important thing is

320
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:41,332
getting everyone ready
for the Arnett Mead game.

321
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:44,194
Right. Sorry. I guess I just got
a little carried away.

322
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:47,645
No, that's all right. That's fine.
I've got some work to do.

323
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:49,743
Hon, could you?
There's a little dirty diaper

324
00:17:49,913 --> 00:17:52,652
that would love to say
"hi and welcome home".

325
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,739
- Oh, OK.
- Hi Daddy.

326
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:58,017
Bye sweet angel.
Now, you're gonna feel better.

327
00:17:58,187 --> 00:18:00,783
- Goodbye.
- Thanks, honey. I appreciate that.

328
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,053
He's mad at me
cause I took the barbecue?

329
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,322
I really appreciate you're doing this.

330
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,901
I really appreciate
you're doing this at your house.

331
00:18:15,071 --> 00:18:16,869
Making it so I don't have to have

332
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,670
all these mean boosters yelling at me
about the jumbotron in my house.

333
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,459
You know what this is?

334
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:24,044
Grown pains.

335
00:18:26,277 --> 00:18:30,006
Honey, it's great, but...
Do we really need this many people?

336
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,468
Cousin Floyd isn't bringing Vicky.
They split up.

337
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:34,148
Big surprise. So that's one less.

338
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,015
Keep him away
from my friends at the club...

339
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:38,988
- Hey!
- Oh, yes mama.

340
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:42,178
- High school memories.
- I'm dying. Gimme one, please.

341
00:18:42,348 --> 00:18:44,033
- I'm dying over here.
- Angela? Beer?

342
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:45,828
Thank you, Timmy.

343
00:18:46,643 --> 00:18:48,751
Timmy, I want you to hear this.

344
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:51,851
You too, Lyla. It is our vows
to each other. Mine of course only,

345
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:54,404
- cause Billy hasn't written his.
- I'll get to it.

346
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:57,072
Ready? Billy Riggins...

347
00:18:58,545 --> 00:19:01,720
No one has ever stuck with me
so long before.

348
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,282
It's there. I know it is, because
when I look at you, I can feel it.

349
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:07,858
When I look at you, I'm home.

350
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,768
I don't want that to go away.
I don't want to forget.

351
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:13,716
Come here.

352
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,427
That's <i>Finding Nemo</i>, right?

353
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,656
I don't think it's very nice
to laugh about it, honey.

354
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:30,079
Oh, no, no, no.
I thought it was a joke. Sorry.

355
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:32,452
I thought it was a joke.
I'm sorry. I think it's great.

356
00:19:32,622 --> 00:19:35,294
I really do.
I think it's really romantic.

357
00:19:36,118 --> 00:19:37,489
What's your problem, Garrity?

358
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:39,710
- What's that?
- I'm saying I think it's great.

359
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,911
<i>I love Finding Nemo</i>.
Where are you going?

360
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:45,094
There's somebody outside.
I can't...

361
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,388
Damn it, Falcon!

362
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,142
- Wait. Rehab Falcon?
- Shut up, OK?

363
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:54,402
I gotta deal with this real quick.
I'll be back in a second. It was...

364
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:56,774
It's real pretty.

365
00:19:57,034 --> 00:20:00,416
It was very pretty.
<i>Finding Nemo</i> has great messages...

366
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:03,424
Finding love, and family.

367
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:05,698
Tim, tell them how much
I love <i>Finding Nemo</i>.

368
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:08,428
Sweet fish.

369
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:11,528
I'm sorry that
my daughter's wedding vows aren't up

370
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:14,290
to Garrity standards,
but then, not much is.

371
00:20:14,703 --> 00:20:16,209
I'll be right back.

372
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:20,421
- Where are you going?
- It is not everybody's taste.

373
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:23,050
- You guys just let it go.
- Of course. It's only my wedding.

374
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,469
You know, you stop being
your little princess.

375
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:28,222
- Jackass!
- Alright. What's going on?

376
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:29,713
Nothing.

377
00:20:32,255 --> 00:20:35,187
- What's going on?
- I just lost my wingman.

378
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,443
There is this abandoned power plant
out by Route 6. It's...

379
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,908
They got copper wire out there,
and copper wire is worth a lot of money.

380
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:51,245
- So we were gonna go out there...
- And steal it.

381
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:52,635
You're kidding me.

382
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:55,601
No, Lou set the whole thing up.
He's got the truck for me.

383
00:20:55,771 --> 00:20:59,043
All I gotta do is get out there,
grab the stuff, and then I'm home free.

384
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:01,414
What about cops?
I mean...

385
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:04,216
You go down Route 6.
That's gonna be littered with cops,

386
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:08,456
and speed traps.
You should just take Pans Road.

387
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:11,180
At least, that gives you
a backway out of there.

388
00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:13,167
You're right.

389
00:21:13,615 --> 00:21:15,254
That's just...
That's good.

390
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:18,604
And much better than
Falcon would do.

391
00:21:20,168 --> 00:21:21,182
What?

392
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,941
Forget it, Tim.

393
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:26,321
- OK.
- Look, hey, hey. Come on. Look.

394
00:21:26,491 --> 00:21:29,825
I really need this, man.
It'll be 2 hours

395
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:33,202
- and no danger whatsoever.
- I got a barbecue tomorrow night.

396
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:35,932
- 8 o'clock. Team function.
- Can't do it. No.

397
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:37,736
Where is everybody going?

398
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:38,913
Please don't go.

399
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,687
- See you later.
- What happened?

400
00:21:40,857 --> 00:21:42,963
We are going home where life

401
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:45,509
is just not so pussy and judgy.

402
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,969
- What happened?
- I said I'm sorry.

403
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:50,137
- Come on, Tyra.
- Thanks a lot, Lyla.

404
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:52,914
- Shut up, Billy.
- Nice girlfriend, Tim.

405
00:21:53,084 --> 00:21:55,270
Thanks for throwing the block, Tim.

406
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:57,226
Mindy, I call you.

407
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:05,539
I don't even know what's going on,
right now. What just happened?

408
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:09,573
- Don't drive away.
- Watch your feet.

409
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:20,714
This gotta be it, right here.

410
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:22,825
1512...

411
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:26,608
Wow! That is a big house.

412
00:22:27,692 --> 00:22:29,248
Looks like a sanatorium.

413
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:31,178
A sanatorium?

414
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:34,680
This is just gonna really boost
Matt Saracen's confidence. Fantastic!

415
00:22:34,942 --> 00:22:37,850
It's got nothing to do with Saracen.
He's gonna have a good time.

416
00:22:38,112 --> 00:22:40,938
They got valet.
Oh my Lord!

417
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:43,255
- Good evening...
- I'll park it, thank you.

418
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:45,025
- There's no charge, sir.
- I know,

419
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:47,194
- I'll park it.
- That's what they do...

420
00:22:47,454 --> 00:22:51,280
- I know. I'll park it. Thank you.
- That's what the valet's for.

421
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:55,576
And make sure they have food all times.
We don't want hungry guests.

422
00:22:55,838 --> 00:22:56,894
Hey y'all!

423
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:01,039
Hey you!
Look at you!

424
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:04,051
You're the sexiest principal
on the planet.

425
00:23:04,221 --> 00:23:06,879
- You look great!
- Look at this beautiful house!

426
00:23:07,141 --> 00:23:09,715
I'm gonna be monopolizing her
all evening. So you go find the fellas.

427
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:15,055
Mr. Shepard, how you doing?

428
00:23:15,315 --> 00:23:17,266
What's the plan for Friday?

429
00:23:17,705 --> 00:23:19,665
Tim is gonna show up late
at the party?

430
00:23:19,835 --> 00:23:22,348
He's not even... I'm taking you
to the party. What is that?

431
00:23:22,518 --> 00:23:24,332
- Something with his brother.
- What?

432
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:26,105
He's got something
with his brother.

433
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:27,276
What is it?

434
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:28,859
I don't know.

435
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,270
Well...

436
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:34,116
It's a lot different than it used to be
back in the olden days.

437
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:37,303
If a guy was gonna take a date
to a party, then...

438
00:23:37,473 --> 00:23:39,121
I mean, I'd take her to the party.

439
00:23:39,739 --> 00:23:43,457
- Dad listen. I know you don't like him.
- No, honey. I like him.

440
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,973
I do. It's just some things
I know about him

441
00:23:47,143 --> 00:23:49,046
that you don't know.
Honey, listen.

442
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,006
Your daddy just...

443
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:53,759
doesn't want you
to have a broken heart. That's all.

444
00:23:55,672 --> 00:23:57,596
He isn't who you're thinking,
alright?

445
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,901
- Alright?
- Alright. Alright.

446
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:18,138
Holy shoot!

447
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:19,531
Come on. Let's go!

448
00:24:20,756 --> 00:24:22,211
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

449
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:23,914
What the hell is that?

450
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:27,610
- That's dogs! Go, Billy!
- Get in the truck!

451
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:38,674
There they go.
They're gone. They're gone.

452
00:25:02,131 --> 00:25:05,414
When Tim was so hungover for kick-off.
You remember that man?

453
00:25:05,676 --> 00:25:08,627
He shows up at the stadium at 8:30.
They wouldn't even let him in.

454
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:12,005
- He had to scalp a ticket to get in.
- Riggins is a beast, man.

455
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,480
This is a huge house.
Probably the biggest in Dillon,

456
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,582
Hello. I think, you forget about
the Saracen estate.

457
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:34,430
I'm a little offended, actually.
But that's fine.

458
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,322
I just keep forgetting, cause it's
2 different sections.

459
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:39,618
You have the north wing
and you have the south wing.

460
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,536
Actually, it's the east wing,
and the west...

461
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:44,251
wing.

462
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:50,161
- Look at this.
- It's like a giant shrine to JD.

463
00:25:51,972 --> 00:25:55,340
Oh my gosh. Look at this one.
It's from 1999.

464
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,494
That would make him... 6.

465
00:25:59,163 --> 00:26:00,581
Seems a little extreme.

466
00:26:00,751 --> 00:26:03,890
Why did he put all these
participation trophies up in here?

467
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,642
Even the fat kids get these!

468
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,895
Hey man!
Sorry we were just...

469
00:26:11,006 --> 00:26:13,987
You know, they actually bronzed
my first diaper.

470
00:26:15,662 --> 00:26:19,565
It's kind of... I can show it to you
if you want. It's in the garage.

471
00:26:30,187 --> 00:26:31,573
That was awkward.

472
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:34,197
So, Tim gonna show?

473
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:36,791
I know he's coming.
He just had a thing...

474
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:39,484
- A thing.
- with his brother or something.

475
00:26:39,654 --> 00:26:41,899
Rally girl and a free 6 pack
on his way.

476
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:45,639
Sorry. I did not mean that.

477
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,642
It's okay.

478
00:26:48,556 --> 00:26:49,757
- Hey baby.
- Hi daddy.

479
00:26:49,927 --> 00:26:51,366
- Hi Tyra.
- Hi.

480
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:55,469
- Hi daddy.
- Hi.

481
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:58,356
- Do you need me to take you home?
- No, I'm fine.

482
00:26:58,526 --> 00:26:59,787
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

483
00:26:59,957 --> 00:27:03,283
Just let me know if you need anything.
Okay. I'll be with the boosters.

484
00:27:03,585 --> 00:27:06,454
- Let me know if you need anything.
- I'm fine.

485
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,492
Let's get the hell out of here.
Help me with this.

486
00:27:16,662 --> 00:27:18,087
Hold on a second.

487
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:21,367
What?

488
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,445
Let's get the other 3.

489
00:27:26,107 --> 00:27:27,954
- Come on, man.
- No, Billy.

490
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:31,740
I'm already late for the party.
Plus I promised Lyla I'd be there...

491
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,564
Forget about Lyla for 2 seconds.
I'm your brother, okay?

492
00:27:35,504 --> 00:27:37,293
I know you're my brother, Billy.

493
00:27:37,463 --> 00:27:41,020
But I don't feel like getting busted
cause you wanna take Mindy and her mom

494
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,741
- out for a nice steak dinner.
- You think this is what it's about?

495
00:27:45,002 --> 00:27:48,399
- I do think it's what it's about.
- I need this. Okay?

496
00:27:49,052 --> 00:27:50,120
I need this.

497
00:27:51,596 --> 00:27:53,593
I got a second chance here, Tim.

498
00:27:53,763 --> 00:27:56,878
Maybe start a little business.
Have a decent life.

499
00:27:58,155 --> 00:28:01,047
Ain't no football games
or rally girls for me anymore.

500
00:28:02,706 --> 00:28:05,956
I'll never ask you for anything else
ever again. So help me God!

501
00:28:06,664 --> 00:28:07,797
But, please...

502
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:11,059
I need this.

503
00:28:13,571 --> 00:28:15,355
Get down, get down! Get down!

504
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:26,213
Unbelievable...

505
00:28:38,193 --> 00:28:39,337
Let's load 'em up!

506
00:28:43,018 --> 00:28:44,611
Oh, here he is.
Here he is.

507
00:28:46,668 --> 00:28:48,874
- Hey, Buddy.
- Good shot! Can we crash the party?

508
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:50,044
Not my party.

509
00:28:50,554 --> 00:28:53,448
- How you doing?
- Good. Having a good time?

510
00:28:53,618 --> 00:28:55,517
- I am having a good time.
- Good.

511
00:28:55,687 --> 00:28:58,266
- Wayne, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

512
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,404
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Likewise.

513
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:05,026
I'm gonna go ahead
inside this real quick.

514
00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:08,186
I wanna get it out of the way.
Cause we've been talking about it.

515
00:29:08,356 --> 00:29:11,328
I just wanna know.
What do you think about the spread?

516
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:17,480
What he's trying to say is we wish
you'd think more about the run issue.

517
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:19,836
Most 5A schools
are going spread, now.

518
00:29:20,096 --> 00:29:22,756
I think you need the right person
to run that kind of offense.

519
00:29:24,357 --> 00:29:26,676
You're saying you don't think
you have the guys?

520
00:29:26,846 --> 00:29:30,512
I don't think we're ready to install
something like that is what I'm saying.

521
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,224
Well Coach, I don't know.
Maybe you just need a shot.

522
00:29:34,486 --> 00:29:36,058
Wait, I don't know...

523
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,811
what you're being paid.
But I'm not paying you.

524
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:43,972
- So I don't really need your opinion.
- We're just talking about football.

525
00:29:44,837 --> 00:29:47,505
Eric, just admit...
Look, JD...

526
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:52,089
is a great little quarterback.
He's got a great arm. Great feet.

527
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:54,788
- You can admit that.
- Is it what you want me to admit?

528
00:29:55,048 --> 00:29:56,830
Well, that's easy to do.

529
00:29:58,668 --> 00:30:01,670
I admit that your son
is an incredible 15 year old.

530
00:30:04,184 --> 00:30:06,473
Most of the kids out there
hit puberty about 5 years ago.

531
00:30:06,643 --> 00:30:09,177
Your son hit it about a month ago,
as far as I can tell.

532
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,567
I know Matt Saracen.

533
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,519
I don't know your son.

534
00:30:18,195 --> 00:30:21,087
Then I would say
this would be an ideal time

535
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:23,565
for you to get to know my son.

536
00:30:23,827 --> 00:30:26,194
Why don't you just
give me a chance?

537
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,877
- You have a good night.
- Alright, alright.

538
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:35,128
Thank you very much for the party.

539
00:30:47,956 --> 00:30:49,164
That was fun!

540
00:30:49,655 --> 00:30:51,742
That house is gorgeous.

541
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,641
And that chocolate fountain.
Did you have some of that?

542
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,379
- That was so good!
- Chocolate fountain.

543
00:30:57,549 --> 00:30:59,869
I even had some boosters
be nice to me.

544
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:03,366
Of course a lot of them were
staring daggers in the back of my head.

545
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:04,691
I could feel that.

546
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:08,086
I spent my whole time
getting my ear chewed off about...

547
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:09,656
Matt Saracen...

548
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:10,989
Boy wonder...

549
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,703
I'm sorry you didn't have
a good time, honey.

550
00:31:22,403 --> 00:31:23,835
You know who I miss?

551
00:31:25,414 --> 00:31:27,128
I miss the Coach's wife.

552
00:31:34,717 --> 00:31:36,610
You know who I can't wait to meet?

553
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:39,476
The Principal's husband.

554
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:41,678
<i>Touché</i>

555
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,532
<i>It's Friday night, folks,</i>

556
00:31:47,702 --> 00:31:50,299
<i>and if you're in Hermann Field
in Dillon, Texas,</i>

557
00:31:50,469 --> 00:31:52,989
<i>you're exactly
where God wants you to be.</i>

558
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:57,242
<i>It's the Tigers of Arnett Mead
versus the Dillon Panthers,</i>

559
00:31:57,504 --> 00:32:00,076
<i>in what should be
a real knock-down-and-drag-out.</i>

560
00:32:00,246 --> 00:32:02,540
<i>It's about heart,
it's about commitment,</i>

561
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,658
<i>it's about who wants it more.</i>

562
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,010
Alright, listen up, this is it.

563
00:32:14,504 --> 00:32:17,949
Anyone doesn't think we can win,
he get the hell of my O-line, alright?

564
00:32:18,332 --> 00:32:20,517
28-cross-5 on one, ready?

565
00:32:21,582 --> 00:32:25,582
<i>Coach Taylor is putting all his money
on quarterback Matt Saracen,</i>

566
00:32:25,949 --> 00:32:28,191
<i>over the much ballyhooed JD McCoy.</i>

567
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:33,363
<i>And there is not a soul
sitting for this one, folks.</i>

568
00:32:34,768 --> 00:32:37,540
<i>Saracen's back to pass,
he's on the pressure.</i>

569
00:32:38,012 --> 00:32:39,012
<i>He fires...</i>

570
00:32:39,545 --> 00:32:40,847
<i>He takes a hard hit,</i>

571
00:32:41,017 --> 00:32:44,507
<i>but completes the pass to Tim Riggins
for a first down.</i>

572
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:51,657
<i>Saracen feints back to pass,</i>

573
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:53,840
<i>all the protection breaks down,
he's gotta scramble</i>

574
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:55,605
<i>A nifty move inside,</i>

575
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:58,179
<i>he's running off the left side line
to the 15...</i>

576
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,933
<i>And he's gonna be
out of bounds about...</i>

577
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:04,978
<i>He gets a late hit out of bounds.</i>

578
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,188
How about a flag?

579
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,599
<i>Coach Taylor is absolutely livid
after that late hit.</i>

580
00:33:13,495 --> 00:33:15,737
<i>I'd guarantee that
he's gonna feel that one, tomorrow.</i>

581
00:33:18,113 --> 00:33:19,895
<i>Saracen hands off to Riggins,</i>

582
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:22,206
<i>Saracen gets drilled again</i>

583
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:24,289
<i>and Riggins is heading
to the house, folks.</i>

584
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:28,177
<i>Touchdown, Panthers!</i>

585
00:33:30,263 --> 00:33:33,538
<i>Saracen's tenacious play
has inspired his team.</i>

586
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:37,719
That's nice, that's your game!

587
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:39,262
Yes, sir.

588
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:43,016
<i>Arnett Mead comes out
that big spread offense.</i>

589
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:45,226
<i>He's back to pass.</i>

590
00:33:46,076 --> 00:33:48,450
<i>He lets one fly,
he's got a man open...</i>

591
00:33:50,256 --> 00:33:53,985
<i>Touchdown as Arnett Mead's
powerful pass in attack</i>

592
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:55,862
<i>has put them back in the lead.</i>

593
00:33:57,528 --> 00:34:00,073
<i>It is an opens up.
It's a reverse option.</i>

594
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,953
<i>No, it's a late pass to Riggins.</i>

595
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:07,290
<i>Riggins leveled,
and Riggins is down...</i>

596
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:11,002
<i>Matt Saracen just keeps
taking it for the team!</i>

597
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:13,038
All we have to do is stay in the I!

598
00:34:14,266 --> 00:34:15,548
<i>Saracen back to pass.</i>

599
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:17,772
<i>Pressure's coming.</i>

600
00:34:19,103 --> 00:34:20,887
<i>He just gets rid of that ball.</i>

601
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:22,806
<i>He's got a man open.</i>

602
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:25,892
<i>Touchdown, Dillon Panthers!</i>

603
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:31,064
We're back in this long one.

604
00:34:32,193 --> 00:34:35,233
<i>Arnett Mead back to pass.
He's looking deep.</i>

605
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:39,366
Touchdown.
Arnett Mead takes the lead,

606
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,200
with less than two minutes left
in this contest.

607
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,202
Can you see all that?

608
00:34:44,462 --> 00:34:46,663
Yes, good.

609
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:52,543
We're gonna get the ball back,
we need to take some more.

610
00:34:52,713 --> 00:34:55,296
- You got one more in you?
- I always got one more.

611
00:34:56,207 --> 00:34:57,332
Alright.

612
00:35:00,821 --> 00:35:03,304
<i>This is it.
The clock is running down,</i>

613
00:35:03,564 --> 00:35:05,306
<i>it is all or nothing, here, folks.</i>

614
00:35:06,043 --> 00:35:08,112
<i>Saracen brings him over the ball.</i>

615
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:34,167
<i>Touchdown, touchdown, no...</i>

616
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:36,754
<i>No, the ball has come out!
The ball is on the ground!</i>

617
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:39,297
<i>And Arnett Mead has it!</i>

618
00:35:40,177 --> 00:35:43,294
<i>He didn't control that ball
going over the goal line,</i>

619
00:35:43,464 --> 00:35:45,427
<i>that is not a touchdown,</i>

620
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:47,807
<i>and this game is over, folks!</i>

621
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:49,950
<i>A brave effort,</i>

622
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,687
<i>where the victory that was promised
was not to be.</i>

623
00:35:53,294 --> 00:35:55,916
<i>The Dillon Panthers have lost.</i>

624
00:36:34,723 --> 00:36:36,344
I'm sorry,
I didn't know you...

625
00:36:37,116 --> 00:36:38,801
I was just waiting for you.

626
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,087
I don't really want...

627
00:36:42,257 --> 00:36:45,831
I was just trying to wait everyone out,
so I don't have to talk about the game.

628
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:52,022
We don't have to talk about the game
if you don't want to.

629
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:55,750
Or we can if you do.

630
00:36:57,228 --> 00:36:58,234
No.

631
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:03,082
How about we go somewhere

632
00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:04,968
and talk about anything but football?

633
00:37:07,576 --> 00:37:08,638
That sounds good.

634
00:37:11,015 --> 00:37:12,174
Cool.

635
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:18,929
They made me employee of the month
at Alamo Freeze.

636
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:20,765
Again.

637
00:37:33,593 --> 00:37:36,374
There's some more pie in there,
you want it?

638
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:39,669
I'm not going to the walk-on
next week, mama.

639
00:37:40,523 --> 00:37:41,523
What?

640
00:37:42,334 --> 00:37:44,144
Alamo Freeze made me an offer.

641
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:47,430
They want me to be regional manager.

642
00:37:48,284 --> 00:37:50,560
- It's a good job...
- Alamo Freeze...

643
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:52,941
Hell no.

644
00:37:53,111 --> 00:37:54,311
Look, I've decided.

645
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:59,047
- And I'm gonna tell Coach tomorrow.
- All you gonna say is thank you.

646
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:02,028
After all that man has done for you.

647
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:04,112
He could've lost his job, Brian.

648
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:06,901
This is not
what it was supposed to be.

649
00:38:07,723 --> 00:38:09,285
I was supposed to buy you a house.

650
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:11,918
I didn't have kids
to buy me no house.

651
00:38:16,078 --> 00:38:17,733
What is wrong with you?

652
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,616
I've done everything right.

653
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:26,756
I've done everything
I was supposed to do,

654
00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:30,234
- and it's still not enough.
- We will keep doing things right.

655
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:33,771
That's what makes you a man.

656
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,059
The son I raised... is a man.

657
00:38:39,979 --> 00:38:42,339
So, you're going to that try-out,

658
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,193
and you're going to play
like God made you do,

659
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:47,585
and you are going...

660
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:49,989
to go to that college.

661
00:38:52,222 --> 00:38:55,828
- What if I don't take your help?
- You're gonna take my help.

662
00:38:56,748 --> 00:38:58,041
I am your mother.

663
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:02,911
Maybe you'll get this scholarchip,
but if you don't, I'm going to help you!

664
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:06,737
You let me be your mama,
that is my job!

665
00:39:14,578 --> 00:39:16,729
- I'll pay you back.
- You bet you will!

666
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:19,233
When you graduate.

667
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,692
And I wouldn't mind
seeing you play football again either.

668
00:39:26,515 --> 00:39:28,998
I think you got game tape
to watch, don't you?

669
00:39:43,518 --> 00:39:45,834
Hey, Mr. Garrity.
Is Lyla around?

670
00:39:46,522 --> 00:39:47,776
Hello, Tim.

671
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,122
Yes, she's in there.

672
00:39:52,877 --> 00:39:55,375
You got you a nice set of cojones,
coming over here

673
00:39:55,545 --> 00:39:57,249
after standing her up like that.

674
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:59,140
Seriously,
it's not what you think.

675
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:01,316
Let me tell you something...

676
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:03,483
Dad, can I talk to him
for a second, please?

677
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:05,438
- Yes, honey.
- Thank you.

678
00:40:06,143 --> 00:40:07,143
Please.

679
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,128
It's okay?

680
00:40:17,347 --> 00:40:18,380
I screwed up,

681
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,080
I'm sorry.

682
00:40:28,236 --> 00:40:31,115
So many people warned me about
getting into this with you.

683
00:40:32,961 --> 00:40:34,517
You know what I tell them?

684
00:40:35,262 --> 00:40:37,546
I tell them that
they don't know you like I do.

685
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:40,424
I tell them that you're a good guy.

686
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:44,166
You are, right?
You're a good guy.

687
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:49,525
Please, don't make a fool out of me.

688
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:54,408
I won't.

689
00:41:29,382 --> 00:41:30,634
Come on, honey.

690
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,409
Listen closer,
like you've never listened to me before.

691
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:01,175
Right now, right here,
do what you do best.

692
00:44:01,435 --> 00:44:04,094
Next week
on an all new Friday Night Lights.

693
00:44:04,264 --> 00:44:06,661
Honey, it's obvious.
You're right, they're wrong.

694
00:44:06,831 --> 00:44:08,865
Doesn't matter,
'cause I'm gonna lose tomorrow.

695
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,089
Do not keep throwing this to me.

696
00:44:11,259 --> 00:44:13,840
Maybe I should have been clearer.
We're not together!

697
00:44:15,062 --> 00:44:16,374
Yes, I'm choosing him.

698
00:44:16,544 --> 00:44:17,764
Let's go, fellows.

699
00:44:17,934 --> 00:44:19,944
We're gonna shake things up
on Friday night.
