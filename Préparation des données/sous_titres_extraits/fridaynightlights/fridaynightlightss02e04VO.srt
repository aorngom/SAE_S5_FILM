1
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,604
What are you doing?

2
00:00:13,923 --> 00:00:16,167
I guess I feel closer to God
if I'm with you.

3
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:18,512
Did you think that line
was gonna work on me?

4
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:19,847
What if I told you

5
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:23,149
I could make him go away
and you could have your job back?

6
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:24,745
I'd say you're crazy.

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,646
- I wish I was the one who killed him.
- Don't say that.

8
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:30,217
If anything happens to you
because of me...

9
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:31,817
I would never forgive myself.

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,194
I'm going to Mexico.
Gonna have surgery.

11
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:37,156
- Probably be walking next time.
- Mexico, huh?

12
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:11,324
Hold up. Hold up.

13
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:14,469
- We're good.
- I'ts gotta be here somewhere.

14
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:18,716
This is it.
The place where miracles happen.

15
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,035
- You're ready for this?
- I'm ready.

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,806
I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous.

17
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:30,064
You know how long
it took us to get here?

18
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:34,254
I'm sorry. Whoever made
the appointment made a mistake.

19
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:37,216
All right, when's the doctor
gonna be here then?

20
00:01:37,517 --> 00:01:38,967
Probably some time next week.

21
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,532
Probably some time next...
probably some time next week?

22
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:46,525
This is insane!
What... kind of office is this...

23
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:49,228
You don't even know, like,
really when he's gonna be here?

24
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,854
Do you run this office, or...

25
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:54,946
Look, the doctor is on vacation
with his family. I don't know for sure.

26
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,363
Here's a card. Call us in a week,
and we'll fit you in.

27
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:05,366
<i>Westcott is on fire.</i>

28
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:07,827
<i>A hand-off up the middlefield.</i>

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,832
<i>And another first down.</i>

30
00:02:10,103 --> 00:02:11,173
Pass! Pass!

31
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:14,348
<i>He's got a man.</i>

32
00:02:14,797 --> 00:02:16,398
<i>He's got it.
He breaks the tackle.</i>

33
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:21,276
<i>Touchdown, and Westcott goes up a punch.
Our champions gave up to the fight.</i>

34
00:02:21,585 --> 00:02:25,013
Did you see what happened? He threw it,
and the other team made a touchdown.

35
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,820
Our defending champs
are taken to the wood shed.

36
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:30,144
Saracen hands
the ball to Williams again.

37
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:34,504
And again, he hits a wall
of Westcott defenders.

38
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:36,692
That play just is not working.

39
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:38,485
Williams on the draw.

40
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:41,000
He's hippity hopping
and he gets nailed.

41
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,474
They're keying on Smash.
Every play. Every darn play.

42
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:46,491
Yep. Not much imagination.

43
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:50,163
Coach McGregor might want to think
about something else.

44
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:53,026
He's running attack with Williams
who is dead in the water.

45
00:02:53,178 --> 00:02:56,080
And his team looks
absolutly frustrated out there.

46
00:02:56,432 --> 00:02:58,469
- All right, let's go !
- Come on. Now.

47
00:02:59,193 --> 00:03:00,530
All right, listen up.

48
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:04,137
Run the ball with Smash. This is retarded.
We're on the same play over and over.

49
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,255
Just run it.

50
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:08,902
They know we're about to run the ball,
you're not doing well without Riggins.

51
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:10,225
It's not your call.

52
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,184
C'mon !
Clock's running. Let's do this.

53
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,550
Draw to Smash. On one.
Ready.

54
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,409
C'mon !

55
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:18,697
Black 12.

56
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,168
Saracen back to pass.
No, it's another throw to Williams.

57
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,373
And he's got nowhere to go.

58
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:28,334
And he is drop for a loss.

59
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:30,954
And here come the boo-birds.

60
00:03:31,983 --> 00:03:34,692
The Dillon Panthers' fans are not happy
about this coach

61
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,340
and situation tonight, folks.
Rightly so.

62
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:39,922
The nail that doesn't bend
gets hammered, and McGregor

63
00:03:40,184 --> 00:03:43,454
and Mcgregor has gotten pounded
all night with his ground attack.

64
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,885
Our state champions

65
00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:48,597
have gotten their lunch handed to them
on their home field.

66
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:51,565
It is a sad state of affairs.

67
00:03:54,683 --> 00:03:56,563
- What a crock.
- Pardon me?

68
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:59,026
Don't piss on my shoes
and tell me it's raining.

69
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:00,567
That's a good one.

70
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:03,516
We just feel like the team needed to...

71
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:05,809
- go in a new direction.
- After two games?

72
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,242
- Yes, sir.
- After two games?

73
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:09,962
Two games? This is...

74
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,864
we wanna go ahead
and pay you for the entire season.

75
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:16,792
Plus we're gonna give you a severance
package just to show you our good will.

76
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,422
- I'm very sorry it worked out this way.
- There ain't no good will in this room.

77
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:25,217
I'm sorry you feel that way.

78
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,261
Pathetic.

79
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:34,560
Taylor, you got a phone call.

80
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:36,770
Hello?

81
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:39,361
Eric, it's Buddy.

82
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,024
How you doing?

83
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:43,810
I'm in the middle of a game.
How did you get this number?

84
00:04:44,206 --> 00:04:46,933
Ah, you know me.
Never mind that.

85
00:04:47,256 --> 00:04:50,041
Listen, the eagle has landed.

86
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,718
- What?
- It's a done deal.

87
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,580
We fired him this morning.

88
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:00,886

00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,094
Hi. Lyla Garrity.

93
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,591
Okay, guys. Come on.

94
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:59,525
I apologize for our boys.
They don't get visitors that often.

95
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:10,081
And so, those are just a few examples

96
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:13,886
of why it's helpful
to make choices in our lives

97
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:16,450
with Jesus in our lives.

98
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:22,876
- That's it.
- Great. Thanks.

99
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:25,233
Any questions?

100
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:26,899
Yo, I got a question.

101
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:29,876
What color panties are you wearing?

102
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:33,178
That was ery funny Doug, very funny.
Five points.

103
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,599
There's more for the rest
if you don't cut it out. Calm down.

104
00:06:37,861 --> 00:06:40,394
Let me ask you a question.
I got a question.

105
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:43,271
If God's so great,
then why do we have wars, huh?

106
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,192
- Did cat catch your tongue?
- I mean, look at Tony over there.

107
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:51,488
Why's tony's parents drunkall the time
beating on him and his sister?

108
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:54,171
Well...

109
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:57,925
That's a good question.

110
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,994
No disrespect,

111
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:07,252
but you people are always coming in here
acting like you care, right?

112
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:08,896
When the truth is...

113
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,185
if you see any one of us on the street, you just run the other way.

114
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,722
- So, who's winning?
- I don't know, it's a tie right now.

115
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:27,131
So, um...

116
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:30,579
I was wondering if you could take me driving.

117
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,197
I can't do it right this second, honey.
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:33,576 --> 00:07:35,887
Mom, I got my permit.
I need to practice.

119
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:38,887
- I'm aware of that.
- Okay, but it's kind of like homework.

120
00:07:39,037 --> 00:07:40,954
Like you need to practice
in order to pass.

121
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:46,257
I'm not gonna do it right this second.
Gracie is almost asleep.

122
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,867
I'm exhausted.
I'm watching your dad's game,

123
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:53,259
I'm not gonna just drop everything when
you want me to go do something. Sorry.

124
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,710
Why is it always about the baby, mom?
I'm still here. You know that, right?

125
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,584
I'm still your daughter too,
just as much as little blob.

126
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:02,792
I'm know, but you don't have to act like
such a brat about it all the time.

127
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:04,375
Oh, I'm a brat. Okay.

128
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:08,023
You're just gonna keep me locked in,
not let me drive or date who I want?

129
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:09,884
What you're talking about?

130
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:12,435
I'm gonna go date the Swede.
Just to spite you.

131
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,363
Oh, well, that's really mature.

132
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,448
- I hate you.
- Come back here right now.

133
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,370
What are we watching right now, six?
For the past week.

134
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,683
"Siempre hay una segre."

135
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:29,169
We have a bag of money,
we're in Mexico for a week now,

136
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,262
a bag of money, booze, no women,

137
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,227
- no stories, no memories.
- Guess what,

138
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:36,841
You should have thought about all that
before you came down

139
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:39,388
in Mexico with me.
I'm here to see a doctor.

140
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,333
And this bag is not a bag of memories.

141
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:43,683
It's a bag of $10,000 for said doctor.

142
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:47,587
So, until I see said doctor,

143
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:51,108
we're not going anywhere,
and neither is the money.

144
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:52,852
Yeah, you are.

145
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:55,278
- I'm not gonna need that. Let's go.
- Don't touch me.

146
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:57,739
- Riggins, do not touch me. Stop!
- We're going out.

147
00:08:58,009 --> 00:08:59,408
No regrets, six, none.

148
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,713
Stop!

149
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:03,701
- Personal reasons?
- Yes.

150
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:07,485
Well, you...

151
00:09:07,877 --> 00:09:11,227
you knew your wife was pregnant
when you took this job, didn't you?

152
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,252
Yes, sir. That's true.
Look, coach, I...

153
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:18,524
I don't wanna leave you in the lurch.

154
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:20,646
I'll be here for the Rice
and the Oklahoma game.

155
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:22,644
The bye week,
we can make the transition.

156
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:25,035
We take Frank,
put him up for quarterbacks.

157
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,436
It's your decision,
bu I'm just thinking about it.

158
00:09:27,587 --> 00:09:30,355
- That might be a smooth transition...
- You sure you wanna do this?

159
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:34,131
Coach, I have to.

160
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:37,668
All right. Then you turn in
your id downstairs.

161
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:40,699
I'll have human resources send over
a termination package tonight.

162
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:43,372
- Tonight?
- Yeah, tonight.

163
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,746
This isn't IBM, Coach.

164
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:50,880
I'm not interested in any exit
strategies or transition plans.

165
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:54,129
If you wanna go, go, and I'll deal
with the situation right now.

166
00:09:54,489 --> 00:09:55,590
So good luck.

167
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,695
Hope you know
what the hell you're doing.

168
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:02,512
That damn thing kept
scratching up my favorite chair.

169
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:04,105
And, uh...

170
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:08,028
I told Landry, I said,
"it's either me or the cat."

171
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:09,728
'Cause one of us has got to go.

172
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,807
And that's when I initiated the...

173
00:10:12,117 --> 00:10:14,981
the outplacement procedure.

174
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:16,985
That's what he's calling it.

175
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:19,065
Technically, Mr. Puddles...

176
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:22,672
If that's what you wanna call him...

177
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:23,987
Yeah, hello?

178
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:26,262
- Hold this up.
- Hold on...

179
00:10:26,412 --> 00:10:27,662
His name was Mr. Puddles?

180
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:29,282
Ironically, he was she.

181
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:30,537
Of course.

182
00:10:30,903 --> 00:10:34,085
Once again,
being a genius, and everything,

183
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:37,442
I hadn't quite figured out
the whole he, she...

184
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:39,154
However you wanna put it.

185
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:45,710
Sorry, guys.
I have got to go.

186
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,600
They just pulled a body
out of the river.

187
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:51,318
Sorry, baby.

188
00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:53,560
Save me a plate, okay?

189
00:10:54,743 --> 00:10:56,301
Tyra, it's good to see you again.

190
00:10:57,496 --> 00:10:59,175
Landry, I'll talk to you later, bud.

191
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:19,496
Today we're looking at guilt
and redemption, sin and grace.

192
00:11:19,871 --> 00:11:22,200
Consider the story of king David.

193
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,693
The beautiful bathsheba catches his eye.

194
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:28,674
He commits adultery with her
and decides he wants her as his wife.

195
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:32,543
This means getting rid of her husband,
so David plans a conspiracy

196
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:35,765
to ensure the husband's
murder in battle.

197
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:38,450
He thinks he gets away with it,

198
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:41,417
but God sees, and God knows.

199
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:46,746
I'm telling you. It was like everyone
in the entire church knew.

200
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:49,932
- You're just being weird.
- I'm not being paranoid.

201
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:52,455
- How would they know?
- This isn't some little thing.

202
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:54,665
This is ridiculous, me thinking

203
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,189
that no one's gonna find out.
I know what I've got to do.

204
00:11:57,347 --> 00:11:59,087
- It's...
- What are you talking about?

205
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,802
I've gotta go turn myself in.

206
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:03,821
And explain that this was just...
this was a huge accident

207
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:06,928
and just hope that they, you know,
go easy on me because my dad's a cop.

208
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,680
That's not gonna happen.

209
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:12,807
What do you think they're gonna do?
Slap you on the wrist?

210
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:15,895
I have no idea

211
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:17,981
- what else to do.
- We're in this together.

212
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:19,817
I can't keep doing this.

213
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:22,777
We have no choice.
You understand we have no choice.

214
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:24,681
We have no choice.

215
00:12:25,251 --> 00:12:27,100
No, we... you're wrong.
We do have a choice.

216
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,754
I can turn myself in,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

217
00:12:29,904 --> 00:12:33,580
- Spend the rest of your life in jail?
- Spend it in jail or what?

218
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:36,416
What's the alternative?
Spend the rest of my life like this?

219
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:41,527
We're in this together, okay?

220
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:47,787
It's us.

221
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,442
Pass, ma'am.

222
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,405
Thank you.

223
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:57,841
Thank you.

224
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:08,414
if this is your escape plan,
it needs work.

225
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,414
I was just kidding.
I heard you got out. Congratulations.

226
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:18,733
Yeah, I'm on probation now.
Congratulations.

227
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,996
Okay.

228
00:13:26,813 --> 00:13:28,340
What are you trying to do?

229
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:31,317
I'm putting my money
where my mouth is. Come on.

230
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:41,441
So what are you gonna do?
Do you have any plans or anything?

231
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:44,645
Not really.

232
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,646
I mean, are you gonna go to school or...

233
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:49,701
I guess so.

234
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:53,493
Gotta get a job too. My probation lady
will be all over my ass about it.

235
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:55,286
What do your parents say?

236
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:57,956
Damn, you ask a lot of questions, huh?

237
00:13:58,527 --> 00:13:59,541
Sorry.

238
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:01,835
I guess I'm just...

239
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:04,587
- ... interested.
- If I tell you, will you shut up?

240
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:07,440
- I promise.
- My parents are in Mexico.

241
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,831
They got deported two years ago.

242
00:14:10,295 --> 00:14:13,837
Left me to live with my uncle
who has a son, my cousin the homey,

243
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:17,225
a real inspiration to me and told me
how selling weed to people like you.

244
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:20,011
Maybe not you.
Anyway, that's how I got picked up.

245
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:22,180
Spent two years in juvie.
Now I'm here. Happy?

246
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,606
Look, stop here.

247
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:25,115
I could take you in.

248
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,023
You don't want to bring
this car in here.

249
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:29,075
Gotta go.

250
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:30,828
Okay, well...

251
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:33,825
Can I? Can I get your number?

252
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:36,168
Just a way to keep in touch.

253
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:39,845
So if this surgery's so great,

254
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:42,906
why can't you just...
Why isn't it okay in the states?

255
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:45,103
Because, like I told you,

256
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:48,391
between washington and the AMA,
gonna take forever to get it legalized.

257
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,076
And I ain't got forever.

258
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:51,950
No more questions.

259
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,503
Yeah, but you... you're saying...

260
00:14:55,576 --> 00:14:58,655
the parallel bars,
and the guy that could move his toes.

261
00:14:59,284 --> 00:15:00,660
You know, I mean, that's...

262
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:04,496
I wanna know if any of these guys
have walked again.

263
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:06,114
What are you doing?

264
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:09,319
What are you doing?

265
00:15:09,623 --> 00:15:13,357
I was asking if any of these guys
have ever actually walked.

266
00:15:13,668 --> 00:15:15,742
No. Nobody else has walked yet.
It doesn't matter.

267
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:19,813
I told you I'm a perfect
candidate for the surgery.

268
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:22,040
I regained feeling in my right hand.

269
00:15:22,324 --> 00:15:25,257
The other couldn't feel anything.
The guy that's doing the parallel bars

270
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:28,546
had no feeling in any extremity.
They couldn't even move a muscle.

271
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:31,174
<i>Señores...
Papeles, por favor.</i>

272
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,354
- What?
- <i>Papeles, por favor.</i>

273
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,206
- Id?
- Wallet. Wallet.

274
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:39,015
- Put those down.
- He wants a beer, relax.

275
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:41,559
Put them down immediately,
don't talk back right now.

276
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,275
Here you go, sir.

277
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,718
Thank you, officer.

278
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:47,370
- <i>Detenme esto.</i>
- Six, relax.

279
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,170
- <i>Detenme esto.</i>
- Yes, sir.

280
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,612
Been through this a million times.
He's not even talking to anybody.

281
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:54,322
He wants memories as well, six.

282
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:57,745
He wants a night on the town.
He wants some senoritas.

283
00:15:58,229 --> 00:16:00,078
- What's it gonna take?
- What are you doing?

284
00:16:00,652 --> 00:16:02,914
What's it gonna take?
You want some memories?

285
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,952
Some señoritas.

286
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,305
Cheers. Go cowboy.

287
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:16,155
Sweet, six.

288
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:18,674
Took you long enough,
now thosa gals are probably gone.

289
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:21,578
Shut your mouth. I should have left you
in there all damn night.

290
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:24,730
Sad sorry ass. I'm not supposed to be
spending my money on your bail.

291
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,998
Yeah, it's my fault that we found
the only honest cop in Mexico.

292
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:29,284
Your ass, Riggins.

293
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:32,318
You know this money for my surgery is not for your damn bail.

294
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,970
What's your problem, six?

295
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:36,859
You know what?
I came down here for a reason.

296
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:38,618
You think it's stupid, but it's not.

297
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:41,828
Go ahead and get loaded tonight
and catch syphilis from whatever

298
00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:45,165
skanky jailbait random hooker
or whore you can find on the street,

299
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:47,083
but I'm going back to the hotel.

300
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,328
Can you at least buy me a couple tacos?

301
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:58,303
Oh, could it be, could it be?

302
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:04,135
Guess who's home?
Julie, dad's home!

303
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,850
Jules?

304
00:17:15,676 --> 00:17:17,921
- What's up?
- Hey, come here.

305
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,438
- How are you? I missed you.
- I'm good.

306
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,292
Good to see you, kid.

307
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:27,077
- Hi, hon.
- How you doing?

308
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:28,748
How's my little one doing?

309
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,284
She's good.

310
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:34,047
- Why is Buddy Garrity here?
- What's wrong, my child?

311
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,715
Hey Buddy.

312
00:17:35,986 --> 00:17:37,467
Look what I found sitting in road.

313
00:17:38,484 --> 00:17:40,671
Look what I founf.
Look what I found on the road.

314
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,014
I put it in the truck.
Here it is.

315
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:44,298
Go to your mama.

316
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:46,568
He's dirty.
I'll be in for dinner in a second.

317
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:49,407
You just got home, so y'all don't stay
out here too long now.

318
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:50,897
I'll be in in just a second.

319
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:52,523
He just got home, Buddy, so...

320
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:55,160
- Nice to see you. Great to see you.
- You too, Tami.

321
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:56,554
Hey, man, how you doin'?

322
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:58,713
Y'all don't be long now.

323
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:00,940
What are you doing?

324
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:04,182
Have you been waiting at the beginning
of the neighborhood or something?

325
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:06,989
- You followed me in here?
- Mcgregor's gonna fight us on this.

326
00:18:08,426 --> 00:18:10,780
Well I just got the call.
That's why I ran over.

327
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:15,321
Evidently he's apparently
got some lawyer,

328
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:20,018
and he refuses to sign anything. There's
an emergency board meeting tomorrow.

329
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,461
Are you telling me I don't have a job?

330
00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:25,510
No.

331
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:28,664
It's just... it's just a little
complication, that's all.

332
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:31,214
You understand I signed
a no-compete, don't you?

333
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:33,523
I can't take on any college jobs
for two years.

334
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,180
You understand that, don't you?

335
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:39,035
"Done, done." That's what you said.
You said "it's a done deal."

336
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,294
"It's a done deal, Eric,"
that's what it is.

337
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:44,351
- What the hell happened?
- I'm sorry, it just...

338
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:46,494
- You're sorry?
- Now, we just got a little...

339
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:49,444
It's just a little hitch
in our get-along. That's all it is.

340
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:50,652
Trust me.

341
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:52,846
I'm gonna do my best.

342
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,873
What about...
What about painting the garage?

343
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:00,823
Dad's obviously never gonna do that.

344
00:19:01,026 --> 00:19:02,440
The garage is fine.

345
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:05,334
Well, there's got to be something, mom.

346
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:08,050
If he has a job,
it helps him with his probation.

347
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:10,185
Okay, do you even hear
what you're saying?

348
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:12,500
I mean, this boy is an ex-convict.

349
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,216
Mom, he's just a kid.

350
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:16,704
You want him hanging around
with your brother and sister?

351
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:17,859
It's not safe.

352
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:21,237
Oh, my God, mom.
You don't even know him.

353
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,664
And neither do you.

354
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:26,951
Look, I appreciate what you're trying
to do here, but the answer is no.

355
00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:28,257
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:34,292
Slow down a little bit.

357
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:37,080
Use your mirrors.
What's over your righthand shoulder?

358
00:19:39,472 --> 00:19:40,840
- Did you look?
- I looked.

359
00:19:41,303 --> 00:19:42,336
Good job.

360
00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:44,135
Thank you.

361
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,850
What's this about you
and the swedish kid?

362
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:53,519
That was really subtle.
Did mom even give you cue cards?

363
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:56,159
No, this doesn't have anything
to do with your mom.

364
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:58,209
She obviously has an opinion, however.

365
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,818
But this is me asking you.
I want to hear it from you.

366
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,653
Mom doesn't like him 'cause he's older.

367
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,155
How much older?

368
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:07,033
It doesn't even matter.
Mom has me in lockdown at our house.

369
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:08,981
Your mother loves you very much.

370
00:20:09,131 --> 00:20:11,426
You have bigger things
to worry about, like your job.

371
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:13,586
Don't bring my job up.
I'll take care of that.

372
00:20:13,737 --> 00:20:16,492
- That's none of your business, my job.
- It's none of my business?

373
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:18,544
No, don't give me that look.
Watch the road.

374
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:27,489
What's this about... what's this about
I hear you and this kid

375
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,409
carrying on in the driveway?

376
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:33,017
- Oh, we're carrying on now?
- Yes, carrying on.

377
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:37,438
Don't look at me like that. I don't like
your tone... Watch out for the road.

378
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,508
Keep your eye on the road.
Look out up here.

379
00:20:39,658 --> 00:20:40,916
You got this turn up here.

380
00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:43,361
Get on the other lane.
This goes on to the highway.

381
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:45,971
You gotta get over to the right.
Get in the other lane.

382
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:47,908
Watch out!
Look out for that!

383
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:51,035
Damn it.
You almost hit this guy.

384
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:52,912
I can't drive when you're yelling!

385
00:20:53,174 --> 00:20:56,374
Look, just stay right where you are.
Just stay right where you are.

386
00:20:56,993 --> 00:20:59,455
This is great.
We can do the operation on Thursday.

387
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:02,327
Those Texas docs nailed your fusion,
so we can skip decompression

388
00:21:02,602 --> 00:21:05,099
- and go right for the injections.
- The stem cells.

389
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:07,405
Technically,
they're embryonic stem cells,

390
00:21:07,556 --> 00:21:09,303
but the sharks don't
make the distinction.

391
00:21:09,622 --> 00:21:10,751
Hang on. Wait.

392
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:14,638
Did you just say you're gonna give him a shot from a shark, doc?

393
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:16,589
Yeah.
Pretty cool stuff.

394
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:20,558
Sharks have one of the strongest immune systems in nature.

395
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,688
It decreases the risk of rejection
and runaway cell growth.

396
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:26,392
We don't want your friend here
going all "jaws" on us.

397
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:27,854
And again, uh...

398
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:30,700
why can't they do this in the states?

399
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,628
Because...

400
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,623
the FDA are a bunch or crybabies.

401
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:37,999
Okay.

402
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:41,185
I don't even want to go out with them.

403
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:45,423
Everyone's gonna think I jock Smash
as much as Smash jocks Smash,

404
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:47,851
And I don't.
We all know that I don't.

405
00:21:48,283 --> 00:21:49,334
What's the point?

406
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:52,930
- He used to be cool, but now...
- Just go out with one of Smash's girls.

407
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:57,184
I mean, you need some kind of rebound
to get over Julie because it's obviously

408
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:59,612
- ... affecting everything.
- This is a gold mine.

409
00:21:59,907 --> 00:22:03,030
- Would they people pay?
- Wouldn't they pay, real question.

410
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:08,196
Hey, space cadet.
Working on a business venture, here.

411
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:10,479
If that's what you wanna call it.

412
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:14,636
Look, I just don't see anybody paying y'all to walk around their lawns naked.

413
00:22:15,097 --> 00:22:16,297
Half-naked, or whatever.

414
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:18,998
We're not walking around their lawns,
and you're being a snot.

415
00:22:21,147 --> 00:22:22,349
- None of it?
- None.

416
00:22:22,697 --> 00:22:24,434
You kinda in all of this on your own.

417
00:22:25,892 --> 00:22:27,701
The Smash talking in the locker room.

418
00:22:32,705 --> 00:22:33,885
What's the deal?

419
00:22:35,308 --> 00:22:37,058
One loss and y'all quit practicing?

420
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,648
Oh, man.

421
00:22:41,244 --> 00:22:44,577
- Just kidding, man.
- We lost the same game last year too,

422
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:48,544
and that worked out okay, so, you know,
we don't want to get too cocky.

423
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:51,255
- All right. Y'all be good.
- All right. Y'all enjoy.

424
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,025
What's the matter with you.
You okay?

425
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,859
What's wrong, man?
You look like you're about to throw up.

426
00:23:02,108 --> 00:23:03,958
Uh, just something's wrong with my...

427
00:23:05,063 --> 00:23:06,963
my burger.
It don't taste-- I'm fine.

428
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,173
- No, ma'am.
- That is incorrect

429
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:13,804
- on the issue of cause for termination.
- Cause? Wait, what cause?

430
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,415
- Nobody ever gave a reason.
- Ma'am,

431
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:19,316
excuse me, we had a student get injured.

432
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,718
Had to go to the hospital
from a practice

433
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:24,298
that went over time limits.
That was against the rules.

434
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:27,731
He got a little overheated. They
gave him some fluids, and he was fine.

435
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:29,830
We're talking about Tim Riggins.

436
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:32,364
Everybody knows Tim Riggins.
He was probably hung over.

437
00:23:33,235 --> 00:23:34,988
It's an excuse which you all

438
00:23:35,253 --> 00:23:38,035
have just dreamed up in order
to justify the lynching of my client.

439
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,645
Coach McGregor...

440
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,558
was fired because
we simply do not like the way

441
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:52,617
he has abandoned
our tradition here in Dillon.

442
00:23:53,176 --> 00:23:56,126
He has come in, he has changed
practices, closed them down.

443
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:58,055
He is not attending booster club meetings.

444
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:00,085
He has changed the pep rally,

445
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:03,978
and he's managed
to destroy our record-setting

446
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,731
offense in a very short period of time.

447
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,720
Which has angered
many parents and many fans.

448
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:11,762
Not to mention the players.

449
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:13,978
I believe I saw

450
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:17,325
I believe I saw our quarterback
and our star running back

451
00:24:17,587 --> 00:24:20,648
in a fistfight at the end of the game

452
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:23,494
the other night in the middle
of the Daggon football field.

453
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,954
It was in a game you won, Buddy.

454
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:27,991
That's not the point, Barbara.

455
00:24:28,776 --> 00:24:31,797
That's not the point.
You, being from Laribee,

456
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:34,350
wouldn't understand.
But here in Dillon, we win seasons.

457
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,362
we win seasons.

458
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:39,714
We don't win games.
State championships.

459
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:42,516
Unfortunately, coach Mcgregor

460
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:44,869
was not getting the job done.

461
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:46,241
We fired him.

462
00:24:46,996 --> 00:24:48,269
End of story.

463
00:24:48,816 --> 00:24:50,566
You're speaking for everybody here?

464
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,570
You bet your ass I am.

465
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,559
- Well, it's undermining me.
- It's not undermining you.

466
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:02,326
- How am I undermining you?
- Well, you were coming in here...

467
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:04,997
You don't know how it's been,
sweetheart.

468
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:08,332
She has been horrible.
She has treated me...

469
00:25:08,596 --> 00:25:11,486
- horribly.
- I know I don't know what's going on.

470
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:14,691
But please, let's start new.
Let's just talk to her.

471
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:16,496
Come on.

472
00:25:16,771 --> 00:25:17,760
Julie!

473
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,353
Jules! Please come in here, please.

474
00:25:26,748 --> 00:25:29,095
- Hey, good morning, kiddo.
- Good morning, sunshine.

475
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,523
Good morning.

476
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:33,985
Mother has something
she wants to tell you.

477
00:25:34,135 --> 00:25:36,177
Your father and I
have been talking, and,

478
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:41,363
I have-- we have together very, very,
very tentatively decided

479
00:25:42,114 --> 00:25:43,744
that you are not gonna be grounded.

480
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:45,765
What's the catch?

481
00:25:45,915 --> 00:25:49,625
No catch other than you need to behave
like I know you know how to.

482
00:25:49,887 --> 00:25:52,469
There's four of us in this family.
You need to respect that?

483
00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:54,877
Thank you.

484
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,174
By the way, congratulations, dad.
It's all over the paper.

485
00:25:58,325 --> 00:25:59,336
What is?

486
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,365
What's in the paper?

487
00:26:03,805 --> 00:26:05,706
Bring it in here.
Bring the paper here.

488
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:08,320
All right, all right.
Ouch, Jesus.

489
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:17,512
{\McGregor fired - Taylor to replaced him?}

490
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:24,255
See, right on that line.

491
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:26,036
Right there. No.
First of all,

492
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:29,165
you have to-- remember
you have to go forward of the car

493
00:26:29,427 --> 00:26:30,498
and back into it.

494
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:33,254
There's a car right there.
You just hit that car.

495
00:26:33,404 --> 00:26:36,338
Honey, you need to pull outside the car,
and back up.

496
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,669
I'm backing up.

497
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:42,387
Now pull forward to the side of the car,
and then back to the curb.

498
00:26:43,021 --> 00:26:45,718
Side of the car.
Okay, look at me go.

499
00:26:46,777 --> 00:26:49,017
- Back to the curb.
- Honey, you're not even listening.

500
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:51,183
- I'm listening.
- Just turn the car off.

501
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,607
Just turn the car off.
Let's just take a break.

502
00:26:54,032 --> 00:26:55,982
Let's just sit for a minute, all right?

503
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,650
Listen, I need to talk to you
about something.

504
00:27:12,118 --> 00:27:16,378
When I was younger I--
There was a guy, his name was Doug Odom,

505
00:27:16,793 --> 00:27:18,879
- he was a lot older than me.
- Mom, don't do this.

506
00:27:19,393 --> 00:27:20,424
Listen, please.

507
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:21,693
Thank you.

508
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,759
I was obsessed with him.

509
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:26,617
And we went to this party once
on fourth of july,

510
00:27:26,918 --> 00:27:29,429
I was with him
and all his fancy friends, and...

511
00:27:33,147 --> 00:27:34,147
Anyway...

512
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:38,053
I slept with him that night.

513
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,818
And that was the first time
I'd ever slept with anybody.

514
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:45,776
I woke up the next morning, I thought
we were gonna be boyfriend and girlfrie

515
00:27:45,926 --> 00:27:48,419
and I saw him the next day and...

516
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:52,983
He treated me...

517
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,376
like I didn't really matter.

518
00:27:57,088 --> 00:27:59,088
Like what happened didn't really matter.

519
00:28:01,197 --> 00:28:03,211
And you're spending
all this time with this...

520
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:06,253
boy who doesn't seem to have a name,

521
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:09,295
I know you like him.

522
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:13,285
- I know you think he likes you.
- His name is Anton.

523
00:28:13,932 --> 00:28:15,135
And he does like me.

524
00:28:17,192 --> 00:28:18,484
Well, he doesn't love you.

525
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,319
And that's the difference.

526
00:28:29,503 --> 00:28:30,803
- Bye, y'all.
- Bye, dad.

527
00:28:30,953 --> 00:28:32,508
- See you, dad.
- That was fun.

528
00:28:33,427 --> 00:28:35,029
- See you next week.
- See you, Thab.

529
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,902
Remember what I said, little bud.

530
00:28:37,052 --> 00:28:38,479
Did you have fun?

531
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:39,737
How are you?

532
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,338
I'll be in in a second, okay?

533
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,508
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

534
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:54,132
Has Lyla talked to you at all
about this boy?

535
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,049
No. We, uh...

536
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,607
We're sort of in a...

537
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:03,259
feeling each other out mode right now.
There's not a whole lot of sharing.

538
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,025
Well, let me tell you where she met him.
She met him in prison.

539
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,232
Okay? At some...

540
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:11,600
counseling session
for christ team messengers.

541
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:16,571
- Pam, we've had this talk before...
- She wanted me to hire him.

542
00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:20,224
And when I said no,
she called me unchristian.

543
00:29:20,514 --> 00:29:21,717
And just walked out.

544
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:24,692
Can you believe that?

545
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:29,899
- She tried to find him a job.
- Yes.

546
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:31,843
I mean, can you imagine this...

547
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:35,561
ex-convict in our house with the kids
and me there all alone?

548
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:39,146
- It's not right.
- Tell you what.

549
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:41,190
I'll handle it.
I'll take care of it.

550
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,817
- Good.
- Okay.

551
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:44,942
Thank you.

552
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:46,510
You're welcome.

553
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:51,385
Santiago, have you ever had
any sales experience?

554
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:55,123
- Not really, sir.
- Well, you ever worked on cars?

555
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:56,998
You ever do any mechanic work?

556
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,846
I usually take the bus.

557
00:29:59,503 --> 00:30:00,503
Take the bus?

558
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:04,555
He had a job last year, right?
Doing dishes?

559
00:30:04,962 --> 00:30:08,092
Yeah. I had a job last year.
Doing dishes like she said.

560
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,910
Well...

561
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:11,637
it's something.

562
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:15,234
It has nothing to do with cars,
but at least it shows he's responsible.

563
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:18,229
Can I talk?

564
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,930
Yes, sir. Please do.
This is an interview.

565
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,493
I'd love for you to talk.

566
00:30:24,786 --> 00:30:27,294
Look, I know I don't have
no experience, sir.

567
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,323
I'm guessing she probably told you
I've been in juvie.

568
00:30:32,117 --> 00:30:35,253
I don't mean no disrespect to you
or to this place, but...

569
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:37,445
I have to get a job, sir.

570
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:41,360
If I don't get a job, they're gonna send
me back to state, I don't wanna to.

571
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:44,177
I'll do anything you ask me
and try not to mess it up too bad.

572
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:45,045
I promise.

573
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,019
- I promise.
- I appreciate that.

574
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:51,093
And if Lyla vouches for you...

575
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:54,179
- I do.
- I'll go with you.

576
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,665
I'll do it. I'll give you a job
in the parts department.

577
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:02,036
It's only 8.50 an hour
and you have to work on weekends.

578
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:03,847
That sounds great, sir.

579
00:31:04,243 --> 00:31:05,275
Thank you.

580
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,116
Sorry, we were supposed
to hang out, right?

581
00:31:32,135 --> 00:31:33,688
Uh, yeah.

582
00:31:34,468 --> 00:31:35,637
Come on inside.

583
00:31:39,403 --> 00:31:40,434
Come on.

584
00:32:01,032 --> 00:32:02,976
- Your phone was ringing.
- My what?

585
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:04,901
Your phone was ringing.

586
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:07,474
Oh, well, that's probably just Jonesy.

587
00:32:07,765 --> 00:32:10,422
I told him we were going
to dry creek, and he got...

588
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,145
all excited.

589
00:32:13,352 --> 00:32:14,596
What's dry creek?

590
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:17,216
What's dry creek?

591
00:32:18,263 --> 00:32:19,393
You know, it's...

592
00:32:19,891 --> 00:32:23,750
It's got foosball, you know, and, and,

593
00:32:24,154 --> 00:32:27,064
I don't know two-for-one beer night,
and I think Kennedy

594
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:28,736
and Chris are gonna join us, so...

595
00:32:28,893 --> 00:32:31,515
Jonesy called Spike
and Spike called Spencer...

596
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:33,854
and...

597
00:32:34,935 --> 00:32:36,198
is there something wrong?

598
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,664
Yeah, um...

599
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:40,379
I just, um...

600
00:32:41,254 --> 00:32:44,730
I'm just feeling really sick,
and I think I should go home, okay?

601
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:48,503
Yeah, um, but you know what?
Have fun, and I'll...

602
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:51,546
Hey, you need...
you need a ride home?

603
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:53,042
It's okay, I got it.

604
00:32:58,202 --> 00:32:59,202
Hey, babe.

605
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:07,703
How was your night?

606
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,360
Jules?

607
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:19,296
What happened?

608
00:33:21,972 --> 00:33:22,986
You all right?

609
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:28,845
Come here.
Come here.

610
00:33:40,257 --> 00:33:41,985
- This is yours?
- Now you wanna drink

611
00:33:42,276 --> 00:33:45,434
a week later,
after I've been boozing all week.

612
00:33:45,696 --> 00:33:48,103
They got a picture of John Wayne.
Let's toast to the duke.

613
00:33:48,365 --> 00:33:50,774
- Here's to J. Wayne.
- Here's to J. Wayne.

614
00:33:51,574 --> 00:33:52,812
Cheers, my friend.

615
00:33:56,932 --> 00:33:59,344
- Let's go. Round two.
- Round eight, soon enough.

616
00:33:59,494 --> 00:34:00,634
Round two right now.

617
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:02,618
To walking.

618
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,841
To runnin'.

619
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:28,894
Is this in english?

620
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,851
What do you got, six?

621
00:34:58,731 --> 00:34:59,925
Clear eyes, Timmy!

622
00:35:22,936 --> 00:35:25,453
Tomorrow's a big day for me, folks.

623
00:35:25,687 --> 00:35:26,692
It's a big day.

624
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:28,823
You know why?

625
00:35:29,648 --> 00:35:32,684
I'm gonna walk-a, I'm gonna walk-a,

626
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:35,032
I'm gonna get out of my chair,

627
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:38,271
and I'm-a run-a, and I'm-a run-a,

628
00:35:39,143 --> 00:35:43,857
and I'm-a get right outta there
because Dillon sucks, folks.

629
00:35:44,147 --> 00:35:46,125
Dillon is an awful place to be,

630
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,138
and I wanna walk away,
and tomorrow, I'm gonna do it.

631
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,596
Look at me.
No, I'm serious!

632
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:57,404
No, I'm serious, I'm serious.

633
00:35:58,128 --> 00:35:59,348
Tomorrow I'm getting a--

634
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:03,524
I'm gettin' a shot-a, I'm gettin' a shot-a
right in my spine and

635
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:06,210
it's gonna make me walk again, folks.

636
00:36:09,106 --> 00:36:12,115
You don't even know what I'm sayin',
but you believe me.

637
00:36:14,326 --> 00:36:15,566
I believe it too.

638
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,961
Timmy, you believe it, don't you?

639
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:23,050
Le it go !

640
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:31,610
I'm gonna walk, Timmy!
Timmy, I'm gonna walk again!

641
00:36:42,844 --> 00:36:43,945
What's up?

642
00:36:44,207 --> 00:36:47,182
Uh, I just got a call
from the Dillon police.

643
00:36:49,963 --> 00:36:52,204
- What they'd want?
- Well, why don't you tell me?

644
00:36:52,466 --> 00:36:55,707
I really don't know. We have to go
down there right now. Get dressed.

645
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:03,829
We pulled a body from the river
a few days ago.

646
00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:05,098
Male caucasian.

647
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:09,182
I need to ask you a couple
of questions about it if you're ready.

648
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:17,103
We found this in the wallet.

649
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:18,749
You recognize this person?

650
00:37:22,255 --> 00:37:24,961
Yeah, it-- Yes.

651
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:27,835
- How do you know him?
- He, um..

652
00:37:29,684 --> 00:37:32,784
He attacked me.
He tried to... He tried to rape me.

653
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:35,885
What? Honey, what?

654
00:37:36,044 --> 00:37:38,440
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
- Why didn't you tell me?

655
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:40,493
Tyra, stay with me now.

656
00:37:41,481 --> 00:37:43,237
Is this the man
who sexually assaulted you

657
00:37:43,518 --> 00:37:46,654
in the parking lot
of the Alamo Freeze last november?

658
00:37:47,409 --> 00:37:49,052
- Yeah.
- All right, then.

659
00:37:49,362 --> 00:37:52,212
I really wanna thank you ladies
for coming out like this.

660
00:37:52,862 --> 00:37:53,862
Wait.

661
00:37:55,468 --> 00:37:57,420
- Is that it?
- Yes, ma'am.

662
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,479
You did a real good job
on your description.

663
00:37:59,848 --> 00:38:01,898
We matched it
with a sketch this morning.

664
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,928
Look, here's your sketch.

665
00:38:04,477 --> 00:38:06,486
This boy was wanted
for rape in two other states.

666
00:38:06,748 --> 00:38:08,786
Oh, my God.
Honey...

667
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,441
I'm sorry, mom.

668
00:38:10,842 --> 00:38:11,992
You can rest easy now.

669
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:13,789
We're gonna close this case.

670
00:38:15,191 --> 00:38:18,046
There'll be someone to show you out,
ladies. Thank you very much.

671
00:38:18,347 --> 00:38:19,347
Thank you.

672
00:38:21,744 --> 00:38:22,857
Thank you.

673
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:33,221
I don't know,
it's some kind of experiment

674
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,677
where they're injecting him
with shark blood,

675
00:38:35,827 --> 00:38:37,434
it's supposed to make him walk again.

676
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,884
Tim, are you drunk?

677
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:43,015
No, Lyla, I'm not drunk.

678
00:38:43,185 --> 00:38:45,870
Maybe I'm not explaining
this very well, but...

679
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,237
I don't know. All this medical stuff
is just over my head.

680
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:51,615
You know,
Jason's parents are worried sick.

681
00:38:51,877 --> 00:38:54,900
Yeah, well, I am, too.
He might actually go through with this.

682
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:57,049
So what am I supposed to do?

683
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:00,962
Come down here.

684
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:03,293
Help me talk him out of it.

685
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:07,599
Come to Mexico?
Are you outta your mind?

686
00:39:21,637 --> 00:39:24,703
I swear, J's gonna die
if he goes through with this, Lyla.

687
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:27,779
I haven't asked for anything from you,
I'm asking you to come down here

688
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,164
and help me help J.
He's not listening to me.

689
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:36,201
Help me.

690
00:39:36,986 --> 00:39:38,135
Please.

691
00:39:44,313 --> 00:39:47,560
I'm gonna tell you one
of my favorite things about myself.

692
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,861
But Gracie'll start.
Gracie, start tellin'.

693
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:52,053
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

694
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:54,161
Because you tell her every five minutes.

695
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:56,024
You're filling her head full of it.

696
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:57,722
Hey, Coach.

697
00:39:59,475 --> 00:40:00,709
Coach, how you doing?

698
00:40:01,217 --> 00:40:02,794
I was filling up the truck,

699
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:06,110
I was rolling outta town,
and I just thought I'd come by and,

700
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:09,317
congratulate you, because it worked out
just the way you wanted.

701
00:40:10,063 --> 00:40:11,800
- How's that?
- How's that?

702
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:14,595
You know, Eric,
I've been a coach a long time.

703
00:40:15,002 --> 00:40:17,529
I been fired before,
and I'll probably be fired again.

704
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,093
But this is the first time
I been screwed by another coach.

705
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:22,093
Just wait a second here.

706
00:40:22,384 --> 00:40:25,750
- You were involved in this thing.
- I don't appreciate that accusation.

707
00:40:26,012 --> 00:40:28,977
It's the truth. You're not gonna lie
to me here at your doorstep.

708
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,130
I don't think you are.

709
00:40:32,742 --> 00:40:36,046
I know you were involved, maybe you had
your reasons, maybe you didn't.

710
00:40:36,206 --> 00:40:39,139
But I want you to know that I have
a family too, you just remember that.

711
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:42,744
I'll be seeing you again.

712
00:41:36,101 --> 00:41:37,113
Listen up.

713
00:41:40,603 --> 00:41:42,003
We got Westerby in two days.

714
00:41:42,153 --> 00:41:44,715
I know y'all don't want another loss
pinned on your asses.

715
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,060
Quarterbacks and receivers
are gonna be with me today.

716
00:41:48,345 --> 00:41:49,985
Linemen on the boards with Mac.

717
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:52,276
Any questions?

718
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:53,969
No, sir.

719
00:41:54,323 --> 00:41:56,049
- What's that?
- No, sir.

720
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,279
- I didn't hear you.
- No, sir!

721
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:01,203

Let's get out there!
