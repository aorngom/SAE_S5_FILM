1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,590
My father worked as a lawyer for the richest family  
in New York  until his plane went down in 
Long Island sound.

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:13,300
My dad left me  only two things--his briefcase
 and his biggest client,the Darlings--

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,240
Tripp,the empire builder...

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,640
I need your help,nicky. 
You're the guy.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,020
Letitia,the sophisticated socialite,

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,490
patrick,the principled politician...

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,950
no,I'm--I'm not gonna go into a hotel
and give a tranny hooker a check.

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,990
Karen,the professional divorcee...

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,580
she's,uh,still in love with you,huh?

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,310
Brian,the man of god...

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,320
I know he's mine,but I can't just
bring him home to my wife and kids.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,730
And jeremy and juliet,the
well-behaved twins.

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,630
yeah.

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,110
I said I'd nev work for
them,but I will for now.

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,060
Because I think one of them
 may have murdered my dad.

16
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,450
here you go,sir.

17
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,100
hey,lisa,have you seen my blue suit?

18
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,180
oh! I forgot to pick it up
from the cleaners. Sorry,honey.

19
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,280
maria... do they have wild salmon?

20
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,010
Yes.

21
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:50,810
Poached... soupcon of hollandaise on the
side,steamed broccoli,but not al dente.

22
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,390
He's been making it nearly raw.
Tell him to crosscut the stem.

23
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,310
I don't know why he
doesn't know how to do that.

24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,260
Damn it!

25
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,280
it was hot.

26
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,770
you know,I can't find anything
today-- my wallet,my keys.

27
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,940
The casual observer might assume you don't
really want to go to work. There you go.

28
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,990
Really?

29
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,160
You don't have to do
this. You know that,right?

30
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,430
What?

31
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,710
Your dad wasted his life
babysitting the darlings.

32
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,170
You don't have to do the same
thing. You know that,right?

33
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,560
Come on,lisa. We've
been through this,okay?

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,080
I get to help a lot of
people with a lot of money.

35
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,450
And I'm also trying to find
out what happened to my dad.

36
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,560
You really think someone killed him.

37
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,610
I think it seems highly possible,yeah.

38
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,820
Is that why you took this job?

39
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,930
Do you feel like... you have
some score to settle or something?

40
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,310
Look,I don't know,lisa.
It was a gut decision.

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,950
I-I took it for many reasons,I
guess,none of which e karen.

42
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,350
Hey,I-I didn't mention karen.

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,580
Look,I owe my dad something.

44
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,600
I just-- I want to
find out the truth.

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,030
-Okay?
-Okay.

46
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,630
Has that airplane mechanic
guy ever called you back?

47
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,550
Norman exley? No. I
called him like ten times.

48
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,900
-Where are my keys?
-Here.

49
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,660
Thank you.

50
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,530
And I would get you your dad's
briefcase if I knew where you put it.

51
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,270
Do you know where it is?

52
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,270
I left it with daisy.

53
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,190
She's figuring out the combination for me.
I'm hoping there are some answers in there.

54
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,640
What?

55
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,230
There. Now you're perfect.

56
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,700
-I may look perfect but--
- just like the darlings.

57
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,530
Love you.

58
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,190
Can freddy be in the picture?

59
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,090
Please.

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,220
No.

61
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,430
this photo shoot,for better or worse,is
gonna launch your brother's senate campaign.

62
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,730
I'm not gonna let you cheapen it
by including your fourth husband.

63
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,750
But,mom,his heart is set on this.

64
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,430
My heart was set on your brother leaving politics
altogether and pursuing a life of emotional integrity,

65
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,920
but that's not happening either.

66
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,110
The answer is no.

67
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,380
You know,patrick's romantic habits
are a lot more embarrassing than mine.

68
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,800
I don't see why you can't be on
my side every once in a while.

69
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,170
You've always been stronger than your
older brother,karen,and you know it.

70
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,970
don't be disingenuous.

71
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,470
It's not becoming.

72
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,860
mrs.Darling.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,130
Yes,elizabeth.

74
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:23,850
The caterers have arrived to discuss
the lunch for the photo shoot tomorrow.

75
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,400
They're waiting in the kitchen.

76
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,490
I'll be right up.

77
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,510
Patrick needs me more than you do.

78
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,300
He always has.

79
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,100
I'm not running for senate.

80
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,860
I've decided.

81
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,440
I'm telling my father today.

82
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,930
And when will you tell your wife?

83
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,250
About the senate?

84
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,960
No,about us.

85
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,610
Soon.

86
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,810
I promise.

87
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,760
Real soon.

88
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,570
I don't believe you.

89
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,700
I'm just asking my sister to come home.

90
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,010
I don't want to.

91
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:04,130
I'm through with daddy paying for everything
and secretly arranging my life behind my back.

92
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,360
It makes me feel like... well,like,this
big,like I'm living on a train set.

93
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,760
That sounds kind of cool actually.

94
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,640
No. I want to be
normal-sized and independent.

95
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,770
Well,then can you at least get a hotel room
that isn't the size of a friggin' postage stamp?

96
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,220
I tried to get the penthouse
suite,but it was taken.

97
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,130
-Bummer.
-Yeah.

98
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,210
who is the mutt?

99
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,620
This is bingles. I found
him the day I left home.

100
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,770
he is my totem.

101
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,970
Are you allowed to have dogs here?

102
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,140
No. But if i were in the
penthouse,they'd be making exceptions.

103
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,530
Would you please be so kind as to
investigate who's staying in there?

104
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,660
I'd be so grateful.

105
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,340
-I'm on it.
-Thank you.

106
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,970
-To independence.
-To independence.

107
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,210
you're going back to your
mother today,and that's final.

108
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,710
I want to live with you,daddy.

109
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,580
Well,you can'T.

110
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,870
and stop calling me daddy.

111
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,670
I lied to my wife and
daughters last night.

112
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,580
-hey!
-I told--

113
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,620
oh,sorry,father.

114
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:11,630
I lied to my wife and daughters last night and told them 
that you were an orphan whose parents were killed 
in a bullet train accident in Sweden.

115
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,010
-What's a bullet train?
-That's none of your business.

116
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,340
The point is,do you know what my wife 
would do if she found out that you talk 
English or--or that you're mine?

117
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,820
Mommy's not gonna take me back.

118
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,480
She'll take you back.

119
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,080
She'll take you back if I have
to shoot you at her with a cannon.

120
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,450
Sorry I'm late. Train got
hung up at union square.

121
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,700
You have a date with
me,and you take the subway.

122
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,120
Usually runs on time. Trust
me,it won't be a prlem again.

123
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,060
Let me set you up with a car.

124
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,650
No,subway's fine. Thanks.

125
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,870
-24/7.
-I'm good.

126
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,680
All right.

127
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,730
What can I do for you,tripp?

128
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,460
Well,we have this photo
shoot happening here tomorrow.

129
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:04,570
We're rebranding the family as... fresh
and hip... before patrick's campaign.

130
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,690
It's idiocy.

131
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:12,980
And since everyone lives here except Brian,
they figured it'd be a good idea to have it 
in the living room.

132
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,010
So what would you like me to do?

133
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,060
Just hang around.

134
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,130
Set a tone.

135
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,890
Make sure everybody gets there.

136
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,300
Sounds simple enough.

137
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,860
Yeah,yeah.

138
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,780
It's a piece of cake.

139
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,780
Here.

140
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,400
what,uh,what's--
what's this?

141
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,710
Oh,I used to give some cash to your
dad at the beginning of every work week.

142
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,670
For?

143
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,600
Well,things come up.

144
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,710
Trust me.

145
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,230
oh,I thought you said
you could open it up.

146
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,240
I'm a paralega nick,not a code breaker.

147
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,350
Any calls?

148
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,070
Juliet called.

149
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,920
She doesn't want to do
the photo shoot tomorrow.

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,410
Here. What? Why?

151
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,590
'Cause she says she's "a free radical now,"
and you of all people would understand.

152
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,690
What else?

153
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,550
Jeremy called.

154
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,080
He wants you to copyright some song he
wrote with justin timberlake last night.

155
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,730
He left it on your answering machine.

156
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,020
Great.

157
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,710
Brian hasn't called to
yell at me? Surprising.

158
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,900
Actually,he did stop by.

159
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,840
This is your mother's phone
number and address,right?

160
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,350
Okay,I'm gonna get in touch with your
mom,and everything's gonna be okay.

161
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,890
-All right?
-Okay.

162
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,650
call for you. It's norman exley.

163
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,710
Put him through.

164
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,200
Hello.

165
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,210
Hi. This is norman exley.

166
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,750
I hear you been l-looking for me?

167
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,960
Look,I know brian darling paid you
$100,000 for something,mr.Exley.

168
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,500
I have the canceled checks.

169
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,360
You sure got all your little ducks
in a row there,don't you,chief?

170
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,020
Yeah,I do. What was the money for?

171
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,430
Well,I did a lot of work on
your dad's plane over the years.

172
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,100
Sometimes,he'd show up early when 
I'd still be spot-checking the engine,
and I'd,you know,overhear things.

173
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,900
Yeah. What kind of things?

174
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,090
Come on,mr.Exley.

175
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,410
You can tell me,or later on,you're
gonna be talking to the police.

176
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,850
Okay,one time I heard your dad talking to
reverend darling about his little secret love baby,

177
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,230
so I gave the reverend,you know,a call.

178
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,670
we came to an understanding.

179
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,870
So you blackmailed brian darling
about his illegitimate son?

180
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,180
Yes,sir. I'm not proud.

181
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,010
Brian darling never paid you
to sabotage my father's plane?

182
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,680
No,sir,not in any way,shape or form.

183
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,170
Thank you for your honesty,mr.

184
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,810
Mr.George.

185
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,730
Yeah.

186
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:56,700
A lot of times when your dad took the
plane,he brought along his lady friend.

187
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,400
-Letitidarling?
-Yes,sir.

188
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,130
I know I--I'm talking
out of school here,but...

189
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:08,550
if I was tripp darling,I sure woulda
found that... troublesome,real troublesome.

193
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,420
-Good morning,clark.
-Ah,good morning,mr.Darling.

194
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,780
-Enjoying that book?
-It's great.

195
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,070
Thanks for giving it to me.
I'm not sure I understand it.

196
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,200
Well,don't take it too seriously.
Just enjoy it,bustick with it.

197
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,210
I'm going to,sir.

198
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,110
The scene at the end when xenophon 
crests the mountain and the water is 
stretched out in front of him...

199
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:39,180
"thalatta,thalatta"-- "the
sea,the sea"-- stunning.

200
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,330
Tish went out this morning?

201
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,570
Uh,yes,sir. I took her
to forest lawn cemetery.

202
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,190
keep it even.

203
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,390
Could you maybe tell
me who's staying here?

204
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,020
Jeremy darling?

205
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,770
What the hell are you doing here?

206
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,320
Natalie kimpton.

207
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,080
Jeez.

208
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,500
You look amazing.

209
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,320
You... look... I-I
got--I gotta go.

210
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,090
No,no,no,no,stay.

211
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,670
I haven't se you since your
sister freaked out on me.

212
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,790
I know.

213
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,350
Wasn't it-- it's
been like a year?

214
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,310
What a crap blizzard that was. Sit.

215
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,210
How did you get up here?

216
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,080
I thought this penthouse
was maximum privacy.

217
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:32,880
Well,I-I-I told the... elevator girl that 
she--she could sing backup with me 
on this project I'm doing with justin timberlake.

218
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,390
Oh,you're writing songs now?

219
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,890
Yeah. You know,whatever.I...

220
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,830
get by.

221
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,000
natalie.

222
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,400
-I-is that
your mom? -Yeah.

223
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,880
She's trading in her third face
for a fourth and a brand-new ass.

224
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,590
So,of course,I'm stuck here taking
care of her like a slave,and her face-

225
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,010
- her face is like a grape
smushed on the sidewalk.

226
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,500
-It's so bad.
-Natalie,come here!

227
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,490
Carlos,mommy wants something! God.

228
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,220
That sucks. I gotta go.

229
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,720
No,no,no,no,no. Stay,stay,stay,stay.
Come here. Please.

230
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,650
It'll be just like old times,you know?

231
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,280
Remember st.Barths? It'll
be just like st.Barths.

232
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,430
You remember st.Barths,don't you?

233
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,120
I don't want to run for senate.

234
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,370
I want to get out of politics.

235
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,120
Okay.

236
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,340
What about the photo shoot?

237
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,430
I already had my office call and cancel because
I'm not running,so what's the point,right?

238
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,490
I mean,I'm not.

239
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,870
-The family's had- -
I'm not the family,dad.

240
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,910
-I'm me.
-Yeah,you're you. You.

241
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,280
And you could be president
of the united states--

242
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,480
I don't want to be president.

243
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,510
I-I let you push me into law school,then
the attorney general's office.

244
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,690
I won't let it happen again.
I can't be a more clear.

245
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,520
Can't you?

246
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:16,410
If you're worried about some things
coming to light in the election...

247
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,190
we can handle that,together.

248
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:27,830
You know,these things have a way
of coming to the surface anyway.

249
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,710
They're like splinters.

250
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,860
They want out.

251
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,450
That's not why I don't want to run.

252
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,560
Come here. Come here.

253
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,630
Come.

254
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:48,670
Contrary to popular belief...
history is not made by great men.

255
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,720
It takes more than one man to change the
world,it takes more than one generation.

256
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,550
It takes a family.

257
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,820
Dad,I don't want to make history.

258
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,670
I just.. want to live my life,okay?

259
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,530
Patty,you're the eldest son.

260
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,650
You're the only one who can carry
on our name in public service.

261
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,640
You're the scion of
the darling family tree.

262
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,820
Please...

263
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,900
make me proud.

264
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,400
Make yourself proud.

265
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,940
we're home.

266
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,900
Hey.

267
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,410
Hi,you must be brian jr. I'm lisa.

268
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,400
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you,too.

269
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,390
Our daughter kiki is in the living room
watching a movie. Do you want to join her?

270
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,060
-Okay.
-She's right around the corner.

271
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,600
All right.

272
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,680
-You're kidding me,right?
-What?

273
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,620
Look,lisa,I told you that daisy already
watched him for two hours at the office.

274
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,630
I'm fine watching him.

275
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,850
What I'm not fine with is that the darlings
think that this is part of your job.

276
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,020
-Well,you and me both--
- you're a lawyer.

277
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,660
-Hey--
- I know.

278
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,400
You always said your dad sacrificed his family to
take care of every crazy thing the darlings wanted.

279
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,710
And now here you are,you're
bringing home this kid.

280
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,680
You're babysitting.

281
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,910
-You know that,right?
-Look,lisa,

282
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,760
I know this sounds crazy,but right now,
this is the best way for me to get to 
the bottom of things.

283
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,430
Okay? I need to do my job.

284
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,040
that's karen.

285
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,530
of course. Take it.

286
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,620
She probably wants you to
wash her pet tiger or...

287
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,720
insure her solid gold toilet,or
something very reasonable like that.

288
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,990
It could be important.

289
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,510
hey,I said take it. Tell her hi.

290
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,110
hey,karen,what's up?

291
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,810
Nick,hi.

292
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,010
it's me.

293
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,350
-Can you hear me?
-Nonot really.

294
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,740
-I need you to do me a favor.
-What?

295
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,360
I need you to do me a favor.

296
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,120
what's up,baby?

297
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,250
nothing.

298
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,480
-I love you.
-Yeah,I love you,too.

299
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,770
I need you to tell freddy he
can't be in the picture tomorrow.

300
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,180
Mommy says no,and I... I just
don't have the heart to tell him.

301
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,680
You think you can handle that?

302
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:57,320
Look,karen,it isn't really my job to tell 
your fiance he can't be in some photo 
shoot for a fashion magazine.

303
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,690
I never thought it was your job,nick.

304
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,160
I'm asking you as a friend.

305
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,710
Nick?

306
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,330
Okay,I'll do it.

307
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,680
Thank you.You're my hero.

308
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,830
Okay. Bye.

309
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,620
Th did sound very,very,very importanT.

310
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,730
Look,if you are ever going to get to the bottom
of things,you need to stop avoiding the obvious.

311
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,000
-Talk to letitia?
-Yeah.

312
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,400
I won't let you do it.

313
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:29,620
I won't let you push that boy into the senate
for the sake of your almighty family name.

314
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,650
You've pushed him his whole life to try to make
up for what happened to your brother kenneth.

315
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,480
-It's not right.
-It's what's best for him.

316
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,810
You know he has issues
that will come out--

317
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:48,620
issues?Our married son has affairs with
transsexuals,and you stand there calling them issues?

318
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,170
don't lecture me in that tone.

319
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,540
Can't someone in this family besides me
live in the light of the simple truth?

320
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,500
Someone? Anyone?

321
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,980
Oh,god.

322
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,150
I wish dutch was here.

323
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,780
Why? Why do you wish dutch were here?

324
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:11,840
Because I miss the days when there was somebody in this
family who knew the difference between power and love.

325
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,800
In this family?

326
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,560
You know what I mean.

327
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,240
Oh,god,no.

328
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,140
***

329
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,550
so... who's up there?

330
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,000
You went up to find out
who's in the penthouse.

331
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,920
Oh,it's--it's-- it's
nobody.It's,um...

332
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,410
-it's some chef.
-A chef?

333
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,250
What kind of chef stays at the
penthouse at the argyle hotel?

334
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,610
It's,uh,some dude from belgium.

335
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,460
He's here to cook for the united
nations at--  cocinar para  what?

336
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,530
God,this place is really changing.

337
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,080
See you tomorrow at the shoot?

338
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,970
Oh,no,you won'T.

339
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:15,720
Why not?

340
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,120
Because I won't be appearing
with the family anymore.

341
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,320
Oh,come on,jules. There's
gonna be lions-- live lions.

342
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,250
-Come on.
-I don't care.Thank you.

343
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,470
I'm on my own now.

344
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,560
Are you paying for this
place out of your own pocket?

345
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,150
What do you mean?

346
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,800
I mean this isn't independence. Okay?

347
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,880
-Dad's paying for it.
-What's your problem?

348
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,750
Oh,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

349
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:42,440
Look,you should-- you should-- you should
come tomorrow and you should be in the picture.

350
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,920
And then you should come home.

351
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,120
we should both get the hell out of here.

352
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,740
Later.

353
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,190
have you always know about the affair?

354
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,190
No. Actually,I just
found out few days ago.

355
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,450
The two of you were real good
at maintaining appearances.

356
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:07,930
W-well,it,uh,it started as a
necessity,and then it became a lifestyle.

357
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,000
Who told you?

358
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,430
-Karen?
-Yeah.

359
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,010
-Does tripp know?
-Why?

360
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,130
The police think that my father's
plane may have been tampered with.

361
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,680
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

362
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,470
It's not clear at all.

363
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,050
I mean,we'll know more once
the N.T.S.B. Reports come back.

364
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,540
But if tripp did know
about the affair...

365
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,510
I just thought that maybe he...

366
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,710
I see.

367
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,300
No,I-I have no idea if he knew.

368
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,030
Your father,nick,your
father... was my great love.

369
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,830
So...

370
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,740
how could tripp not have known?

371
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,960
I know. I've thought the same thing.

372
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:01,930
But... nick,for the past 40 years,I've read
every look on his face like it was code,

373
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:10,100
wondering if he was gonna come down to bed and--
and--ask me or tell me he knew or... he never did.

374
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,240
Do you think he's capable of murder?

375
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:24,170
we're all... capable of everything.

376
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,970
You know,tripp's faith in--
in god has always been shaky.

377
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,360
He--he puts his
faith in facts.

378
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,370
He--he believes in history.
He keeps track of everything.

379
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:42,160
If he did know about the affair,he
would've written about it in his journal.

380
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,890
He keeps it in his desk.

381
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,170
And you've--you've
never looked at it?

382
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:57,140
No,no,I've always been... too frightened
to find out... how much I've hurt him.

383
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,420
Why is that?

384
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,600
Because... I love him,too.

385
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,130
Please tell me none
of the darlings called.

386
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,500
Just the lion wrangler.

387
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,530
Am I supposed to know
what you're talking about?

388
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,450
No one told you?

389
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,700
Apparently there are gonna
be lions at the photo shoot.

390
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,560
But you need to figure
out the insurance first.

391
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,590
-Live lions?
-I know. Crazy.

392
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,690
So what do you want me to do?

393
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,350
Well,I guess we should
get some lion insurance.

394
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,670
Did,uh,brian jr.'S
mother ever call back?

395
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,700
No.

396
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,470
And did you solve juliet's
problem with the photo shoot?

397
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,830
When did all this become our job?

398
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,050
Yeah,yeah,yeah,I know.Tell
me about it.I'll see you.

399
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,240
Mr.George.

400
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,710
Hey,maria.

401
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,930
Hola.

402
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,050
Yes.

403
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:22,100
Okay,so,look,I just took this journal from
mr.Darling's desk,and you probably saw me.

404
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:28,040
And I don't want you tthink I was doing
something that I'm not-- I'm not--I'm not.

405
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:34,070
So I need this for,uh,well,it's something to do
with the family-- a very high-priority matter.

406
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:43,180
I'd appreciate it if we could keep this between
-- just in between you and me,for the sake of 
security,family security.

407
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,650
-500.
-5-500 what?

408
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,660
Yeah,yeah. $500,sure.
Here. $500. Here you go.

409
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:55,650
-Uh,hey,tell you what,how about $1,000?
-$500 is plenty.

410
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,970
Okay,all right. There you go.

411
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,630
Fantastic. Okay? Thank you.

412
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,050
There were quite a few times I walked in
on your father getting away with things.

413
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:11,320
He put my daughter alejandra
through college  and med school.

414
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,400
you find anything?

415
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,770
Nothing that indicates with absolute certainty
that tripp knew anything about the affair.

416
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,590
There's lots of stuff in here
about poetry and arctic expeditions,

417
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,340
but barely any mention of dad
or,for that matter,letitia.

418
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,260
Not even on the day your dad died?

419
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,670
Yeah,actually,that's the
one thing that's kind of odd.

420
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,480
Check it out.

421
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,730
Look at this.

422
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,000
What the heck did that say?

423
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,490
I don't know,but why
did he cross it out?

424
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,260
kiki! Hey,kiki!

425
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,070
How's he doing?

426
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,770
He's all right. I think he's
a little discombobulated.

427
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:57,620
Did you get ahold of his mom or is he
spending the night,maybe staying forever?

428
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,910
Are we gonna adopt him,perhaps?

429
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,100
No,I called her like five
times. She never returned.

430
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:06,210
Then the last time I called,I got this
recording saying the number's out of service.

431
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,810
-Take a look at this.
-What is it?

432
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,260
The kids were drawing
pictures this afternoon.

433
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,810
He did this one of his mom
at this giant waterfall.

434
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,500
Well,he's a better artist than tripp.

435
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,690
This is in brazil,which
is where she's going.

436
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,340
-She's going to brazil?
-Yeah.

437
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,090
-I-- I thought it was
imagination...  -damn it!

438
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,860
You know?
I mean--

439
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,250
well,do me a favor animagine that
she hasn't already gone to brazil.

440
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,120
-She's gone.
-Who?

441
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,160
The mother of your son.

442
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,220
What are you talking about?

443
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,970
That address you gave me,I
just came from there,brian.

444
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:44,420
The landlady said she left last
night,sold everything,went to brazil.

445
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,640
What are you gonna do about the kid?

446
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:51,490
What... you know,it's funny,brian,I just
came here to ask you the same question.

447
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,850
you know,your father was a cash-sucking
leech,but at least he wasn't willfully stupid

448
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,970
or self-righteous or whatever it is that makes
you show up here expecting me to be nice  you.

449
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,390
I'm not gonna claim that kid,nick,even if
you leave him on my friggin' doorstep,okay?

450
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,200
Good night. God bless.

451
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,270
why doesn't daddy live
here? It's so much bigger.

452
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,990
Well,that's because he lives
near the church where he works.

453
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,630
But today he has to be here
to get his picture taken.

454
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,620
Come on.

455
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,630
Daddy doesn't want me,does he?

456
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:33,420
Hey,brian,listen,sometimes
daddies get confused.

457
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,310
But sometimes when a-- when a
daddy gets around his own daddy,

458
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,090
things get less confusing
very,very quickly.

459
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,040
Hey,I want to show you
something. Come here. Up.

460
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,510
-What is it?
-You'll see.

461
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,360
welcome to the family,id.

462
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,860
***

463
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,460
***Where have you been?

464
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,660
You have to tell freddy
he can't be in the picture.

465
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,210
-I'm sorry. I forgot.
-Nice.

466
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,100
Who is this?

467
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,900
Rebecca colfax,family
publicist. Who are you?

468
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,300
Nick george,family lawyer.

469
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:17,720
Oh,well,this photo is probably the most important
thing ng that's gonna happen in this campaign.

470
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:20,920
People will be voting for the darlings
as much as they'll be voting for patrick.

471
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,430
And mr.Darling told me
you'd be here to set a tone.

472
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,170
-So get in there and set it.
-Okay.

473
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,590
Hey,brian,this nice,lonely lady
is gonna get you some cake.Okay?

474
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,280
Thank you.

475
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,080
Uh,uh,can you,uh,get it cake?

476
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,240
Freddy,you're a golfer,so I'm
gonna give it to you straight.

477
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,720
-Hit me.
-You can't be in the picture.

478
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:51,060
-Who says,karen,her mother?
-I do.

479
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,350
I'm sorry. It's nothing against
you. It's just familyolitics.

480
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,270
-You're still in love with her.
-What?

481
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,340
You. You're still in love with her.

482
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,600
Freddy,it's just a picture in a magazine for
women and girls.What's the big freakin' deal?

483
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,440
Fine. You know what? You can keep
me out of the picture,nick. Okay?

484
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,470
But you can't keep me out
of the picture. Got it?

485
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,090
Karen is mine.

486
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,870
He's still in love with you.

487
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:24,180
Hi. Thanks for... taking care of that.

488
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,280
Not a problem.

489
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,210
Why didn't you cancel this?

490
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,600
Well,I didn't want to
ruin it for everyone.

491
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:33,640
And just because we're taking a
picture does not mean that I'm running.

492
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:39,000
You can't keep pleasing your father
forever. Tell him no and move on.

493
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,960
-Completely.
-Still no luck with the briefcase,huh?

494
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,370
I've been kind of busy. I'm
just getting around to it.

495
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,390
Yeah,what's going on with the juliet
situation? I haven't seen her here yet.

496
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,420
Oh,that's fine. I solved that one.

497
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,900
-What does that mean?
-You'll see. Bye.

498
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,590
oh... what a circus.

499
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:11,080
"But yet I know,where'er I go,that there
hath passed away a glory from the earth.

500
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,820
"  what a glory your
uncle kenneth was,cupcake.

501
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,180
-Who is this girl?
-bring in the lions!

502
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:28,160
beautiful. Hold it.

503
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,300
-magnificent.
-One minute,dream kids.

504
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,520
Has anyone seen my journal?

505
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,580
I've been looking for it all morning. I
can't imagine where I could've set it down.

506
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,570
-Tish?
-No,I haven't seen it,dear.

507
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,400
Have you come across an orange
journal during your stay with us?

508
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,770
What,do you think I stole it?

509
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,950
-You're--you're
not my sister. -Duh.

510
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,250
Nick,is this travesty your idea?

511
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,360
-Technically,no,but I- -
I asked you to set a tone.

512
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,470
And I'm trying,tripp.
I'm trying. Did,uh--

513
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,300
excuse me.

514
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:06,980
what do you think you're doing,bringing him 
here where my whole family can see him,
where my father can see him?

515
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,960
Oh,I'm sorry. Is that a problem?

516
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,440
Hi,daddy.

517
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,510
Who is this unnamed youth?

518
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:18,460
he's an... orphan whose parents were
killed in a bullet train accident in sweden.

519
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,880
Could he have taken my journal?

520
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,450
Oh,no,I don't think so. No.

521
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,090
Why would he take your journal,tripp?

522
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:26,870
Perhaps he thought it was filled
with arcane secrets and treasure maps.

523
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,860
It's that ki of object.

524
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,200
-Does he speak english?
-Uh,no. Uh,just swedish.

525
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,220
***

526
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,080
I was on the nobel peace
prize committee in 1990.

527
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,590
It was a fascinating experience.

528
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,810
***

529
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,320
is he deaf?

530
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,360
Uh... was he in the train with
his parents when it crashed?

531
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,070
look,I took it,okay? I
took--I took the journal.

532
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,030
I took it. I'm sorry.

533
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,820
I took it. I'm sorry.

534
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,560
Well,why would you take my journal?

535
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,340
I took it because I
wanted to figure out...

536
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,080
what?

537
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,970
Who killed my dad.

538
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,620
and--and you--you
thought it m-might be me?

539
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,420
Is that why you stole my journal?

540
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,600
Well,I thought that...

541
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,180
what possible reason could I
have had to do such a thing?

542
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,580
He was my best friend.
I-I don't understand.

543
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,040
you all right?

544
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,880
Don't even pretend
to be concerned,tripp.

545
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,650
Just say what you came to say.

546
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,750
-I'm astounded.
-By what?

547
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,600
That someone could be so mistaken.

548
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,660
I know.

549
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,770
I'm sorry.

550
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,750
It's--it's-- it's
not your fault.

551
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,170
I-I mean,it-- it's
not even nick's,really.

552
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:18,220
I'm sure... blaming someone must be 
an attractive notion in the face of such 
hideous randomness,

553
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:22,220
even when it's so obviously groundless.

554
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,670
I'm sure.

555
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:33,440
But still... it's such an extravagant
accusation to make... to think,even.

556
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,110
Yes.

557
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,740
Please...

558
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:44,530
I know that you miss
dutch as much as I do.

559
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:51,600
And I know this is A...
terrifically hard time...

560
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,330
but we'll get through it.

561
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:04,040
We'll get through it together--
you... and me... and nick.

562
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,910
Thank you for coming to find me.

563
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,770
I have to rest.

564
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,920
brian,would you just wait a minute?

565
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,290
What are you gonna do,hit me?

566
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,690
Hey,look,I just want to talk.

567
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,300
I didn't kill your dad.

568
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,550
Look,brian,it's
just--

569
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,280
look,brian,just listen
to me for a second.

570
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,840
Every minute that I spend working with 
this family is another minute that I find out 
I didn't know my father at all.

571
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,120
-That's not my fault.
-And that's not the point.

572
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,740
Don't do that to your son.

573
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,250
Let him get to know you
while there's still time.

574
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,900
-I can't!
-Yeah,you can.

575
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,990
Go home,tell the truth,figure it
out,for the sake of your only son.

576
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,740
-don't do that again.
-What?

577
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,130
That "only son" thing. It's stupid.

578
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,610
Could you check and see
if I have some mail,please?

579
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,340
Juliet darling.

580
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,410
-No problem.
-Thank you.

581
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,240
Jeremy!

582
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,890
Uh,hey.

583
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,910
What-- what are
you doing here?

584
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,290
I was just going to surprise you.

585
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,110
You didn't tell me you were coming here.

586
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,730
That's crazy.

587
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,750
Um... surprise.

588
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,480
Hi.

589
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,840
silly.

590
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,820
How was the photo shoot?

591
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,150
It was,uh,it was--
it was a trip.

592
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,360
-Oh,yeah?
-Yeah.

593
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,380
-Did everybody miss me?
-We did.

594
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,030
Um,but you know what?

595
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:49,880
It was--it was kind of like you were
there,like we-- we did,we felt your prence.

596
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,150
Oh,good.

597
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,610
-Guess what.
-What?

598
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,350
The guest in the penthouse
isn't a belgian chef.

599
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,140
It's natalie kimpton,and she's
been staying there all month.

600
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,390
Natalie...

601
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,840
why'd you lie to me?

602
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,090
I didn't--I didn't
want to bum you out.

603
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,990
Don't lie to me,jeremy,especially
about natalie kimpton.

604
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,390
She was my best friend in
the whole world,and then--

605
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,800
she put out your signature
perfume without your name on it.

606
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,630
-Yeah,and--  -she
stole your bangs.

607
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,550
Yeah,and I hate her guts.

608
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,520
And that's completely understandable.

609
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,200
Thank you.

610
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,590
I--hang
on a sec.

611
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,800
Jeremy darling. Go.

612
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,220
I just took a shower.

613
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,200
I'm hot and I'm very,very,very wet.

614
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,980
I'm-- I'm gonna-- I'm gonna
have to get back to you on that.

615
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,390
What is that supposed to mean?

616
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:40,220
Uh,you know,just work on the second verse 
and then give me a call when,um,when it's gold.

617
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,750
Okay?

618
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,380
Bye.

619
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,500
-who was that?
-Uh,that was justin.

620
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,480
-Timberlake?
-Yeah.

621
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:54,950
He,uh... you know,sometimes he can't,like,see
the-- the forest for the trees,and so I... help him.

622
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,100
Like,he gets all eggy.

623
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,830
Do you promise not to
lie to me ever again?

624
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,800
You got it,sis.

625
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,130
-Promise?
-Yeah,yeah.

626
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,860
I don't know what...

627
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,020
-got into you.
-Got into me,yeah.

628
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,160
Okay,here's the deal-- we're gonna tell my
wife and kids the truth,but not until it's time

629
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,560
-,okay?
-Okay.

630
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:16,320
So,uh,until then,just,uh...
act swedish,okay?

631
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,350
Okay.

632
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,550
And,uh..

633
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,280
. you know,I'm--I'm
really,really sorry this is hard.

634
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:28,520
You know,because if it was up to me,you 
wouldn't even be here,but,uh,oh,I mean,
you know,that came out wrong.

635
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:35,500
But,you know,what I mean is,uh... just,uh,so
you--you scratch my back,I scratch yours.

636
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,850
-Okay?
-Okay.

637
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,980
Hey... what's your name,swedish name?

638
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,920
-Gustav.
-Good boy.

639
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,630
All right,now you go up there
and you go straight to bed,okay?

640
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,030
Okay,daddy.

641
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,340
what is the matter?

642
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,690
I can't concentrate,or
stop concentrating.

643
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,270
Oh,I don't know.

644
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,440
I'm sorry.

645
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:15,570
-What do you want to do,pat?
-About what?

646
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,030
Your dad wants you to
run,your mother doesn'T.

647
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,460
What do you want to do

648
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,670
***

649
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:28,360
If I say something,don't get mad,okay?

650
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,070
okay.

651
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,080
I think that you should run.

652
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:41,470
You should embrace what he wants for you 
and win and go even further than little tripp 
darling ever dreamed of.

653
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,910
I like the sound of that.

654
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:51,720
Doing what he wants today is the only way that
you might be able to do what you want tomorrow.

655
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,800
-hello.
-Hi,nick.

656
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,570
Hey,karen. What's up?

657
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,770
I just wanted you to know...
I'll always love you,too.

658
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,200

Uh,hey,karen,listen,I--karen.

659
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:20,240
I know. I shouldn't
have said it.I'm sorry.

660
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:25,020
Okay. Good night.

661
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,280
Karen?

662
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,460
What the hell are these?

663
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,630
Virtual reality goggles.

664
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,050
You really didn't have to do this.

665
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:47,360
Well,sure I did. I mean,you're trapped

666
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,940

00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,400

the time is right,you look where you want 
to go,and then you blink.

672
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,730

00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,540

Every young american child  has
the right  to a great education,

687
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,380
to not only fulfill  the
dreams of their parents,

688
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,070
but most importantly,their own dreams.

689
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:35,690

that I announce my candidacy for the 
united states senate representing the great state--
