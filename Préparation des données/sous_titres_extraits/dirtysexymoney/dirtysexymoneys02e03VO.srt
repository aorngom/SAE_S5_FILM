1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Previously on "dirty sexy money"...

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,610
I get that it was an accident,patrick,

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,890
but we still have to call the police.

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,070
I mean,if this gets out,the election...that'll be done.

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,050
Dad wants me to write a heartfelt eulogy for ellen's memorial...

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,420
thinks it'll clinch the election...

7
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,220
and all I can think about is carmelita.

8
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,920
Who's this prosecutor they got on mom's case?

9
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:15,770
A real pit bull.

10
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,440
This is her?

11
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,150
You hooked up with me and then arrested my mom.

12
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,580
No one will ever find out.

13
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,220
What you do to me,it scares me a little,you know?

14
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,080
But I like it.

15
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,880
We've got her.

16
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,540
You really expect him to defend the woman who's accused of murdering his father?

17
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,470
I'll take the case.

18
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,400
Ladies and gentlemen,the new vice chair of darling enterprises... nick george.

19
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,950
Do you think it's because you took the case?

20
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,000
Lisa,I didn't know.

21
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,180
Someday,nick,you're gonna have to make a choice between their family and ours.

22
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,060
I hope you choose us.

23
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,510
And if elected to the senate,

24
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,240
I will fight to protect you all from a similar,fiery fate.

25
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,950
I will make it my goal that no parent or child,no husband or wife,

26
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,660
shall ever have to take that dreaded late-night call and.

27
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,810
and,uh...

28
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,290
and experience the anguish that all of us

29
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:18,040
who loved my dear wife ellen felt three weeks ago.

30
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,150
No one.

31
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,760
Thank you.

32
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,270
That's patrick darling,speaking here today about stricter fire codes

33
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,350
in the wake of that recent tragedy that claimed the life of his wife.

34
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,290
That's a good speech.

35
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,970
Thanks.I'm so proud.

36
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,430
Patrick,there's nothing wrong with keeping people safe.

37
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,150
I know that,nick.

38
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,660
But my dad's got me pimping my wife's death for votes

39
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,580
as if she really even died in a fire.

40
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,770
I mean,you saw me in there.

41
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,620
I'm falling apart.

42
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,580
Listen,why'd you really ask me down here?

43
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,030
Nick,what if I.

44
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,880
what if I came clean?

45
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,010
Well,how clean,exactly?

46
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,920
Well,what iwe go to the cops and tell them

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,800
that ellen tried to kill me but died accidentally,

48
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,680
and to avoid a scandal,we had clarky take the body up to valhalla,

49
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,800
and he's the one that torched the place?

50
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,120
You know,what if we.

51
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,180
told the truth?

52
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,230
Patrick,you could face charges for obstruction of justice and for arson.

53
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,870
You think I'd really do time,though?

54
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,280
I don't know.It's hard to say.

55
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,670
All right.Great.Let's do it.You set that up?

56
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,300
Wait a minute.

57
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,570
Patrick,I just took the job defending your mother for allegedly murdering my father.

58
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,500
When it comes to darling felonies,I'm booked.

59
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,650
I don't care,okay?

60
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,950
My dad may think it's a great strategy,

61
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,510
selling my fake sorrow for votes,

62
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,700
but I can't show up at that debate tomorrow night

63
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,110
and perpetuate this lie on national television.

64
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,620
I mean,this has got to end.

65
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,760
All right.

66
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,440
Look,I'll see what I can do.

67
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,260
Great.

68
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,000
Thanks a lot,nick.

69
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,610
Tripp,we've got a problem.

70
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,240
What to wear.

71
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,260
Yeah.

72
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,970
What are you up to today,exactly?

73
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,200
Oh,you know,same old,same old... prosecuting your mother for murder.

74
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,070
You like the weepies a lot,huh?

75
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,870
Yeah.

76
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,770
I also like guys who don't touch.

77
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,240
My stuff.

78
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,370
They're playing at irving plaza this weekend.

79
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,880
Maybe we can catch one of their shows.

80
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,690
Jeremy,please consult your owner's manual.

81
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,030
You and me are only you and me within these four walls,okay?

82
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,890
We don't go window-shopping on fifth avenue,

83
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,030
we don't go to brunch with your friends,

84
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,400
and we do not go out to see the weepies.

85
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,330
Now if you'll excuse me,I've gotta go see a man about a murder.

86
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,280
Good morning,nick.

87
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,520
Well,we're about to find out if it's a good morning or not,daisy.

88
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,390
Did the prosecution's witness list get here yet?

89
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,690
Nope,no sign of it.

90
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,860
Then it is.

91
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,110
Call judge wyeth and let her know that nola lyons just violated her first court order.

92
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,010
Violated?

93
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,970
Give a girl a break.

94
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,770
Ms.Lyons is here to see you.

95
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,360
Thank you,daisy.

96
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,940
Keeping your busted little office doesn't mean you haven't sold out.

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,770
You know that,right?

98
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,760
Just give me the witness list.

99
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,950
What,you couldn't have sent a process server?

100
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,900
No.

101
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,550
It's a little delicate.

102
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,080
There's a name on this list that you're not gonna be very happy with.

103
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,790
It's someone you haven't seen in over 30 years.

104
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,210
What the hell are you doing,nola?

105
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,520
Your mother's my star witness,nick.

106
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,070
Anything in her testimony will be completely irrelevant.

107
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,740
- She hasn't communicated to any of us... 
- not true.

108
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,060
Your mother was the last person to speak to your father the day he was murdered.

109
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,430
And as you will see on page 17 of the murder book,

110
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,180
I've discovered hundreds of wire transfers your mother's received from guess who.

111
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,970
Letitia darling.

112
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,570
Payments letitia continues to make to this day.

113
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,230
Payments for what?

114
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,510
You tell me,nick.

115
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,760
You tell moi.

116
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,680
I don't get it.

117
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,760
Why didn't grandpa name you as his successor,dad?

118
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,590
You said you were his right-hand man.

119
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah,well,maybe he's a lefty.

120
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,490
So how's brazil,shrimp?

121
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,570
Very hot.

122
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,730
Hang on a second.

123
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,570
Hey,what the hell?

124
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,420
- Hey,we're talking.
- I'll be right back.

125
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,410
What is that ball of crap?

126
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,840
Chicken empad O.

127
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,620
That's your dinner?

128
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,530
Where's your mother?

129
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,570
She'S...

130
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,660
busy right now.

131
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,790
Is she not there?

132
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,540
She's here.

133
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,680
She's just.

134
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,790
resting.

135
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,480
She left you by yourself at night?

136
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,340
No.

137
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,920
Mrs.Volkmann checks in.

138
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,180
Mrs.Volkmann?

139
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,490
The wife of a war criminal checks in?

140
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,520
What a relief.

141
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,250
I can take care of myself,dad.

142
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,100
That's fine,but you shouldn't have to.

143
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,050
You know what?That's it!

144
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,280
I am coming down there.

145
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,220
And you tell that absentee mother of yours

146
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,850
when she gets home from her night of grilled beef

147
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,610
and mba that her little brazilian carnival is over!

148
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,690
How embarrassing... you catching me butchering chopin like that.

149
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,350
What's wrong?

150
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,340
What happened?

151
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,380
Le vivier-sur-mer.

152
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,050
it's a village in france.

153
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,490
You must have heard of it.

154
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,840
You've been sending checks there for years.

155
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,940
Oh,my god.

156
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,690
I don't know what clare told you,but...

157
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,250
well,she hasn't told me anything,letitia.

158
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,210
I haven't spoken to my mother in 30 years.

159
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,200
Then how did you find out?

160
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,650
Thwitness list.

161
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,550
She's been called as a witness in the case against you.

162
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,440
You paid to send hy?

163
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,190
Awa no,no,it... it wasn't like that.

164
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,940
Well,by all means,tell me what it was like,

165
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,750
because I'd love to know.

166
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,680
I offered her a place to live and a tiny little stipend.

167
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,360
So what,you could have my father all to yourself?

168
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,760
No!

169
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,940
Oh,nicky.

170
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,560
You don't understand.

171
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,710
She...she was unhappy.

172
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,190
Well,of course she was unhappy,letitia.

173
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
You were sleeping with her husband.

174
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,500
It started long before that.

175
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,360
You know,today,they'd call her,I don't know,bipolar.

176
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,590
At the very least,she was depressed,

177
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,350
and for a young child to be around that...

178
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,430
let me get this straight.

179
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,440
You...you paid my mother off 30 years ago to help me.

180
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,900
That's your story?

181
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,220
She wanted the money.

182
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,800
She wanted to leave.

183
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,250
She wanted the money.

184
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,250
It was her idea,not mine.

185
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,040
I'm sorry,nicky.

186
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,110
If you don't believe me,ask her yourself.

187
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,660
Hello?

188
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,900
Uh,yeah,hello.

189
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,150
Is this clare?

190
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,220
Yes,who's calling?

191
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,260
It's nick.

192
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,760
Nick george.

193
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,500
Your son.

194
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,920
Where are you?

195
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,730
I'm in new york.

196
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,530
I am calling you because you're on the witness list for letitia darling's murder trial,

197
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,240
- and I am defending her.
- I can't talk about this.

198
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,760
- I just want to ask you a few...
- don't call me again.

201
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,060
You okay?

202
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,700
Were you listening in on the call?

203
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,430
A little.

204
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,690
Then you know how I am.

205
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,570
Thank you.

206
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,930
Do you want the good news first or the bad news?

207
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,980
How about the good?

208
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,930
I booked you on a flight to paris for tonight

209
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,410
in case you don't want to take no for an answer.

210
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,970
And what's the bad news?

211
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,810
I hate to interrupt your takeover of darling enterprises.

212
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,450
brian darling is here.

213
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,340
But I need some legal advice.

214
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,840
Thank you,daisy.

215
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,060
Walk with me.

216
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,610
<font color="#ffff00">Dirty Sexy Money
Season2 Episode03</font>

217
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,260
Look,I'm not exactly an expert in international child custody law,brian.

218
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,980
But just because andrea might be partying every night doesn't mean

219
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,560
that you can take your son out of the country

220
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,190
or even out of her house without her consent.

221
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,460
But you know he'd be better off here in new york with me.

222
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,110
You know he would.

223
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,760
It doesn't matter.

224
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,520
She's got full custody.

225
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,420
Yeah,and whose fault is that?

226
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,480
Yours,for bribing the arbitrator last year,

227
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,950
thereby ensuring that andrea would get full custody.

228
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,240
You know,your moral superiority was always pretty sickening.

229
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,260
But since you stole the company out from under every other kid in the family,

230
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,390
it really doesn't fly!

231
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,550
That is not true,brian.

232
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,600
- Taxi!
- And you know that.

233
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,230
I was just as surprised as you were.

234
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,760
Taxi!

235
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,680
- Taxi.
- I'm going to brazil.

236
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,600
Tell your benefactor I'll be in touch.

237
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,310
All right.

238
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,730
Well,don't do anything stupid,all right?

239
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,070
No,I wouldn't dream of it,boss.

240
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,290
- That's my... 
- move.

241
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,450
I'm sorry.

242
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,130
I'm astounded.

243
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,270
Nick ratted me out?

244
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,980
You should thank him,paddy.

245
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,810
He did you a favor.

246
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,040
This conversation is gonna save you a lot of regrets.

247
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,750
Come on.

248
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,250
How can I have any more regrets than I have right now?

249
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,600
I mean,how could I put my kids to sleep at night telling them

250
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,230
to pray to their mommy in heaven knowing that I...

251
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,250
knowing you what?

252
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,080
I just want to tell the truth.

253
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,370
Oh,yeah.

254
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:38,860
And what about everyone else who was involved in this,um,situation?

255
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,540
What about carmelita?

256
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,960
What about her?

257
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,260
Well,she's your mistress,isn't she?

258
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,360
Or she was until she disappeared.

259
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,500
You don't think this will draw the tabloids' attention to her?

260
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,130
So what,dad?

261
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,340
You just want me to keep on lying?

262
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,090
Damn it,patrick.

263
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,210
This is not a lie.

264
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,910
Your life with ellen,that was a lie.

265
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,480
I know that,dad,and I want my life with carmelita,when I find her,not to be.

266
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,240
Oh,terrific.

267
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,150
Now I want to tell the truth,

268
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,040
and that's exactly what I plan to do in the debate on friday,

269
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,190
and let the chips fall as they may.

270
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,000
At least then,my conscience will be clear.

271
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,500
Maybe you don't remember what that feels like,but I still do.

272
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,340
How long has your mom lived in france?

273
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:32,860
Well,ever since she split up with my dad and left new york,so,uh,33 years.

274
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,400
Well,how come we never visited?

275
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,930
Kiki,let your dad finish packing,okay?

276
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,030
You know,actually,I tried once after I graduated from high school because I just...

277
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,740
I wanted to see her because I was starting to forget her face.

278
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,730
And,uh,you know,we exchanged some letters,

279
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,460
and she asked me to meet her in paris at sainte-chapelle,

280
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,190
which is this gothic cathedral.

281
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,860
And I went there,sat and waited,and she never showed up.

282
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,430
And you never heard from her?

283
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,950
Nope.

284
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,000
Well,I think she'll be happy to see ou.

285
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,590
After all,she has to be proud,right?

286
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,240
I mean,you're,like,famous now,because of the darlings.

287
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,140
I need some more socks.

288
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,270
What's going on?What's the problem?

289
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,030
Nothing.

290
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,070
It's just,you know how many times I've tried to get you to reconnect with your mom?

291
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,990
I suggested it when we got engaged,

292
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,370
then I suggested it again after kiki was born.

293
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,230
So I'm going now.

294
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:30,940
What's the problem?

295
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,070
There's no problem,nick.

296
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,530
It's just one more thing you'll do for the darlings that you won't do for me.

297
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,660
have a safe flight.

298
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,340
Brian.

299
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,950
What are you doing here?

300
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,930
I came to see my son.

301
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,640
You flew 6,000 miles spur-of-the-moment?

302
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,480
Yeah,thought I'd check in with the shrimp,you know,kinda.

303
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,440
enjoy the nightlife.

304
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,870
What are you talking about?

305
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,870
Nothing.

306
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,380
Just that I hear there's a lot of things you can do here at night,

307
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,560
out of the house.

308
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:17,650
He'll be home from school at 4:00.You can come back then.

309
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,950
What are you looking at?

310
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,560
And nick was so coy when daddy announced that nick was gonna take over the company.

311
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,670
He was,like.

312
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,310
oh,oh,m-me?

313
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,790
Little old me?

314
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,520
You should've been there.

315
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,970
I almost feel like I was.

316
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,600
I'm sorry.Am I boring you?

317
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,970
No.No,no,no.

318
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,500
I always enjoy weeklong monologues about my girlfriend's ex.

319
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,430
It made me mad,that's all.

320
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,630
I understand that.

321
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,640
What I don't understand is the pleasure you get from dwelling on it continuously,

322
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,590
at the expense of everything,including us.

323
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,260
Karen,nick has shown you in a number of ways,spoken and unspoken,

324
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,920
the kind of low regard he holds for you.

325
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,520
Let him go,unless you've become accustomed to the pain he makes you feel,

326
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,340
unless it's become some kind of comfort.

327
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,320
No,it's not a comfort.

328
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,620
Really?

329
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,950
Listen,I'm nobody's punk.

330
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,000
You understand that?

331
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,860
And I'm not gonna sit here and listen to another conversation

332
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,330
about the man who disrespects the woman I love.

333
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,630
Karen,it's boring.

334
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,620
If you're really not convinced yet that nick george has no respect for you,go talk to him,

335
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,470
give him one last chance to surprise you.

336
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,940
But you know what?

337
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,390
I bet he won'T.

338
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,170
Ms.Lyons.

339
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,080
Yes,sir.

340
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
How can I help you?

341
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,320
A little heads-up.

342
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,080
Can't wait.

343
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,720
I hearfrom one of our air marshals out at J.F.K.

344
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,640
Nick george went to france?

345
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,840
Yes,I'm aware.

346
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,340
Any idea why he's over there?

347
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,100
Yeah,I have a pretty good idea.

348
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,600
He's talking to my star witness.

349
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,550
It's his mother.

350
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,570
I can't really stop him.

351
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,700
You do have a plan,though?

352
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,150
Yeah,I have a plan.

353
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,390
My plan is to nail letitia darling's ass to the wall for murder,win this case,

354
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,420
and after I'm done basking in the glory of my newfound celebrity,take your job.

355
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,700
Little heads-up.

356
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,400
Look what I got.

357
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,610
What.

358
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,300
you can't just show up here.

359
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,410
If anybody saw you,it could cost me the case and my job.

360
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,230
Sue me.

361
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,910
I'm incorrigible.

362
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:30,880
What are these?

363
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,180
Tickets to the weepies.

364
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,450
I just got 'em.

365
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,550
Jeremy.

366
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,830
if you're not out of here in the next ten seconds,I will never see you again.

367
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,160
anywhere.

368
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,280
I don't know how else to say this,but we don't do exteriors.

369
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,590
We can'T.

370
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,340
Okay?

371
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,200
10.

372
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,920
9.

373
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,050
- Nola... 
- 8.

374
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,210
- 7.
- Okay.Won't happen again.

375
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,140
6.

376
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,060
5.

377
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,790
4.

378
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,970
3.

379
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,010
2.

380
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,630
1.

381
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,460
Coming.

382
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,810
Karen.

383
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,750
What are you doing here?

384
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:14,690
Looking for nick.

385
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,710
Is he around?

386
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,550
No,I'm sorry.

387
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,460
He's not.

388
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,130
Will he be back anytime soon?

389
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,950
'Cause I can... I can just wait.

390
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,840
You'd be waiting a long time.

391
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,860
He's in france.

392
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,220
Separate vacations?

393
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,440
No,actually.

394
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,900
He's visiting his mother,

395
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,760
who had to move 4,000 miles away to escape your criminally insane family.

396
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,760
Someone's a bitch.

397
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,430
Yeah,someone is.

398
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,440
Okay.

399
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,130
Will you give him a message for me?

400
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,830
You know what?

401
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,760
Since you and your family seem to see more of him lately than I do,

402
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,890
how about you give him a message for me?

403
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,180
Do you want me to warn him that you're feeling a little hormonal?

404
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,660
cute,but no.

405
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,910
I want you to tell him that the next time he decides

406
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,560
to represent a murderer or rule a multi-billion-dollar empire,

407
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,720
I'd appreciate if he'd consult with me rst.

408
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,710
Because believe it or not,

409
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,960
those kinds of decisions actuallyffect my life,too,

410
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,350
not to mention my marriage.

411
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,850
Okay,that's quite a message.

412
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,270
And,uh,I guess just.

413
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,890
tell him when you see him that back in the real world,

414
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:19,910
his wife really misses him even though she's not sure who she's missing,

415
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,550
because the nick george she used to know,the nick she fell in love with,

416
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:28,020
doesn't seem to really,you know,exist anymore,so.

417
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,420
crazy,isn't it?

418
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,220
I always thought d lose him to you.

419
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,780
Turns out we're both losing him to tripp.

420
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,690
Did you get all that?

421
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,690
Yeah.

422
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,070
Yeah,I got that.

423
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,570
I'm sorry.

424
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,430
Me,too.

425
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,450
Oh,my god.

426
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,740
Nicky?

427
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,690
I knocked on the door.

428
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,910
Why did you come here?

429
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,790
Like I told you on the phone,I'm defending letitia darling,

430
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,790
and I need tdiscuss your testimony.

431
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,350
I don't have anything to say.

432
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,120
I'm sorry your father's dead.

433
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,690
When was the last time you spoke to him?

434
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,860
A lifetime ago.

435
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,430
You sure about that?

436
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,490
What about the darlings... letitia?

437
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,640
When is the last time you've seen or spoken to her?

438
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,470
I haven't been part of their world in decades,

439
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,640
any more than I've been part of yours.

440
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,160
Well,letitia darling's been paying you a stipend for the last 30 years.

441
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,750
Stipend?

442
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,450
Is that what she calls it?

443
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,690
It's sevance.

444
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,750
It's $350,000 a year,not including this house.

445
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,510
That's nearly $11 million in total.

446
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,350
It sure sounds to me like you're a part of their world.

447
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,170
I won't explain myself.

448
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,560
I can't,and you'll never be satisfied with my answers.

449
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,370
Well,I'm not leaving here until I get some,satisfactory or not.

450
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,110
Bonjour!

451
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,340
Martin.

452
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,050
Nous avons un invit?

453
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,750

454
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,130
Oh,bienvenue.

455
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,990
Nick works for the american law firm that distributes my grandfather's trust.

456
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,010
Oh,very important job,yes?

457
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,120
Please,stay.

458
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:08,960
Eat with us.

459
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,700
I promise you never have better oyster.

460
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,860
Actually,nick was just about to leave.

461
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,510
He has a long drive back to paris.

462
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,180
You know,paris can wait.

463
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,190
I'd love to stay.

464
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,160
When I was young,I was an ostréiculteur.

465
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,280
Oyster farmer.

466
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,300
But now.

467
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,860
now I am broker,with many,many boats.

468
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,450
I,uh,probably sell soon.

469
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,950
If we had children,maybe not.

470
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,080
But,uh,that was not meant for clare and me.

471
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:45,470
Uh,I could give to my nephew,but,uh,mm,poof.

472
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,720
He's idiot.

473
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,480
You have kids,nick?

474
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,580
Yeah.

475
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,990
Yeah,I have... I have a daughter.

476
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,190
Ah,yes,well.

477
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,050
and how old is she?

478
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,330
She is 10.

479
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,170
Ah,you have a picture?

480
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,680
I do.

481
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,520
Uh,this is,uh,that's my wife lisa.

482
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,590
Ah,superbe.

483
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,940
And there she is.

484
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,840
There's kiki.

485
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,940
Clare?

486
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,780
And your parents?

487
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,060
Well,my father passed away recently.

488
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,260
Oh,I'm very sorry.

489
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,070
Thank you.

490
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,240
And your mother?

491
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,670
Uh,well.

492
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,830
well,she...she left when I was a little kid,

493
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,690
so I didn't really get to know her.

494
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,650
So,uh,that must have been,uh,very difficult for you,yes?

495
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,750
No,I-I wouldn't know.

496
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,990
It was my life.

497
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,950
I lived it.

498
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,840
I'm gonna clear the dishes.

499
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,950
No,no,please,please.

500
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:43,840
I do that.

501
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,690
Yes.

502
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,190
It's better for you to stay,maybe talk business,you know?

503
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,540
Money.

504
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,130
You ready to talk now?

505
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,150
New yorkers are gathered here tonight at the civic auditorium to witness the debate

506
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,620
between incumbent danielle root and attorney general patrick darling.

507
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,060
And now to come to character.

508
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,350
Attorney general darling,your opponent has said,and I quote,

509
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,630
"patrick darling's relationship to the truth "

510
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,130
is like his relationship to his famous family,

511
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:30,150
"insecure,"on again,off again,

512
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,400
probably based purely on financial gain."

513
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:39,090
Now what do you say to the voters of new york about your character,

514
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,260
particularly as related to honesty?

515
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,650
Well,dan,I'm glad you brought that up,

516
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:51,270
because there is something about which I'd like to finally set the record straight.

517
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,040
As all of you know,my family recently experienced a great tragedy...

518
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:05,330
the death of t mother of my children,my beloved wife of over ten years,ellen.

519
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,790
Mr.Attorney general?

520
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,600
Excuse me.

521
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,240
I'm sorry,dan.

522
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:34,230
a,uh,story got out after.

523
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,490
yes,sir.

524
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,230
a story came out after the fire that.

525
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,950
ellen had become a heavy smoker.

526
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,780
Yes.

527
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,230
It's not true,dan.

528
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,280
She only smoked when she was upset.

529
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,930
It was not a habit.

530
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,760
I,um.

531
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,560
just.

532
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,840
wanted the people to know.

533
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,880
Well,thank you for that helpful clarification.

534
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,170
Moving on.

535
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,620
Thank you for visiting,dad.

536
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,690
Are you kidding?

537
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,200
If I could,I'd be with you every day.

538
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,670
So come live here.

539
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,840
Yeah,well,when darling enterprises moves its corporate headquarters to the amazon rain forest,

540
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,910
maybe I will.

541
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,940
Daddy,mommy's house is that way.

542
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,610
Yeah,I know.

543
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,350
This is a shortcut.

544
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,460
I'm your father.Have a little faith,okay?

545
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,000
This isn't the way home.

546
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:31,690
Oh,you're right.

547
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,030
Hey,maybe this nice gentleman will give us a ride home.

548
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,010
- No,dad.
- Hello,senor.

549
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,330
Will you give me and my son a ride to his mother's house?

550
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,200
Come on,shrimp.

551
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,220
Get in.

552
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,990
I'm not getting in until you tell me where we're going.

553
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,350
We're going to new york.

554
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,200
You need to be somewhere where you're being taken care of 24/7,

555
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,980
not just in between street dances or vision quests

556
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,700
or whatever the hell your mother's doing every night.

557
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,960
Dad,mom works at night.

558
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,220
She works?

559
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,650
Right over there.

560
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,010
That's where she goes every night?

561
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,350
Is that why you brought me here?

562
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,780
Yeah.

563
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,030
Yeah,and what about the checks I send?

564
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,720
She doesn't cash them.

565
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,990
She wants to make it on her own.

566
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,600
Don't tell her I told you.

567
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,430
Your father and I met when I was 20.

568
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,950
I was in my sophomore year at U.N.C.,S-still a kid,

569
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:27,730
and here was dutch,this handsome yankee lawyer in his.

570
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,200
sapphire suspenders,part of this darling dynasty.

571
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,520
So,what,are you trying to tell me that he took advantage of you?

572
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,050
No,no,no.I loved your father.

573
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,890
I wanted to be his wife.

574
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,240
I wanted to be part of his world.

575
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,340
But,um.

576
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:52,690
by the time you were born,both dutch and I realized.

577
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,670
I couldn't survive in new york society.

578
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,510
Couldn't?

579
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,020
I didn't belong.

580
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,570
So.

581
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,940
Slowly I began to,uh.

582
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,830
disconnect.

583
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,310
from myself.

584
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,590
from him.

585
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,200
from you.

586
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,020
So I decided to leave.

587
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,710
Why didn't you take me with you?

588
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,430
You flourished in my absence.

589
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,230
Look at you.

590
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,520
What the hell are you talking about?

591
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,130
The idea.

592
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,970
that abandoning me was somehow a productive decision is ridiculous.

593
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,750
I wasn't able to take care of you.

594
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,310
What was I supposed to do?

595
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:49,980
I don't know.

596
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,430
I don't know.What were you supposed to do?

597
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,840
Maybe you could've just looked at me and seen me and thought it was worth it to try,

598
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,940
to make an effort to be a mother.

599
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,490
Now you dragged me into this world.

600
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,780
I didn't ask to be born.

601
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,170
But the minute that it got hard,you gave up,

602
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,820
you took the darlings' money and you ran away.

603
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,960
That's what happened.

604
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,550
I don't even know what to say to that!

605
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,830
Well,you could say you're sorry.

606
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:11,800
I'm sorry!

607
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,610
Very good.

608
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,520
See?It's all better now.

609
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,100
Oh,please,stop!

610
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,310
I know that you spoke to my dad the day that he died,

611
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,510
so I want to know what was said in that conversation,

612
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,950
and I want to know what you're gonna say when you testify.

613
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,410
And you can tell me starting now.

614
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,710
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ici?

615
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,780
What is happening here?

616
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,750
Please.

617
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,020
Are you all right,my darling?

618
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,180
Oh,yes.

619
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,500
I think,uh,maybe you should go.

620
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,150
- We were just... 
- Please!please!Go!Now.

621
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,570
He's sleeping.

622
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,240
I'm envious.

623
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,350
He showed me where you work.

624
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,190
What the hell?

625
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,890
Brian.

626
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,440
I send you those checks so you don't have to work.

627
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,820
I am not gonna live off your family.

628
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,490
Yes,you are.

629
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,320
Look,I don't care how proud you are.

630
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,090
You cannot leave our son home alone at night,okay?

631
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,830
You can'T.

632
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,980
Now I'm his father.

633
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,380
This is not about you.

634
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,470
Just take the money.

635
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,000
Okay.

636
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,960
You win.

637
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,710
This one.

638
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,470
You know,when you first showed up here,

639
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,450
I was convinced you were gonna kidnap him or something.

640
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,890
Kidnap him?

641
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,620
You serious?

642
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,940
Why would I do that?

643
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,700
He...he's in good hands.

644
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,940
He's gonna miss you when you go.

645
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,030
I'm gonna miss him like hell.

646
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,970
Patrick?

647
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,690
Where is she?

648
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,270
You did very well tonight.

649
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,730
Dad,where's carmelita?

650
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,270
She's okay.She's safe.She's near.

651
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,660
I was fortunate.

652
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,550
A friend of a friend in homeland security was able to track her down and.

653
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,230
you know,she told me that after your late wife had her driven away,

654
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,420
after that was done,

655
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,640
she made the decision to remain in hiding out of concern for your political future,

656
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,840
a concern that you do not seem to have the good sense to share.

657
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,900
So you've got her.

658
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:53,060
somewhere,and now you're going to keep her from me unless I play along,is that right?

659
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,480
Paddy.

660
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,410
Okay.

661
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,670
You win.

662
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,370
Where is she?

663
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,440
Here.

664
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,610
I meant it when I said you did well.

665
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,270
You looked presidential,son.

666
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,820
Nicky!

667
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,650
What are you doing here?

668
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,450
I-I wanted to see you.

669
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,680
Why?

670
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,540
I am...

671
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,480
so sorry.

672
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,290
I-I know it doesn't matter anymore,

673
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,980
and that you'll probably spend the rest of your life hating me...

674
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,110
I don't hate you.

675
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,040
Yes,you do,and you should.

676
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,310
I feel sorry for you.

677
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:58,050
Every day I didn't have a mother,you didn't have a son.

678
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,900
Letitia killed your father,nicky.

679
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,560
That's what I'm gonna tell the court.

680
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,270
On the basis of what evidence?

681
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,570
She told me she was going to.

682
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,380
The day your father's plane went down,I.

683
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,260
I got a call from him,out of the blue.

684
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,720
He was an absolute mess.

685
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:25,140
He'd just found out that brian was his son and letitia had been lying to him.

686
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,330
He was gonna walk away and...and leave the darlings.

687
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,730
And he,uh,he wanted me to know that he was.

688
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,230
he was sorry for everything.

689
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,820
And then he said,he was going to come over

690
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:43,360
and see me and he wanted to have a fresh start.

691
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,290
And what did you say?

692
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,320
Well,I-I didn't know what to say,so I told him that,you know,

693
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:52,290
I-I still cared for him,but that we couldn't start all over again.

694
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,940
Too much time had passed it was lunacy.

695
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,560
And did that upset him?

696
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,410
No,he was drunk.

697
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,630
He just hung up the phone on me.

698
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,450
And then what?

699
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,030
I got scared.

700
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,200
I didn't want him suddenly showing up here on my doorstep.

701
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,830
So I,um.

702
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:14,950
picked up the phone again and called the one person I thought could stop him.

703
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,630
Letitia.

704
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:20,700
And you told her that dutch wanted to leave her for you?

705
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,010
Yes.

706
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,580
And...and what did letitia say?

707
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,800
What were her exact words,if you can remember them?

708
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,890
"Don't worry,clare.

709
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,670
I will take care of everything.

710
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,950
Trust me."

711
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,140
I didn't know what that meant.

712
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,560
I mean,if I thought for a second.

713
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,300
no,no.

714
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,640
That she was going to do something,

715
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,370
- I would've...
- no,no,no,letitia didn't kill dad.

716
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,860
If you tell that story in court,

717
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:43,040
she will die in jail for a murder she didn't commit.

718
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:47,160
My silence is not for sale anymore.

719
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,300
She didn't do it.

720
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,150
Why aren't you proud of me?

721
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,490
I am doing this for our family.

722
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,310
No.No,no,no.No,you're not.

723
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,020
You're doing this for yourself.

724
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,590
I'm telling you she's innocent.

725
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,960
I am telling you to trust me.

726
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,230
Trust me.

727
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,650
Trust your own son who's never asked you for a damn thing.

728
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,820
Don't testify.

729
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,440
Stay here.

730
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,850
Take the money and live your life in peace.

731
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:15,160
Please.

732
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,700
Do this for me.

733
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,390
Yeah,yeah,yeah.

734
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,000
No,it's all coming together.

735
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,760
I've got karen so busy chasing her own tail,she'd never suspect a thing.

736
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,170
I'd say all this time and effort's gonna pay off very soon.

737
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,270
Wait,hold on.

738
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,470
She's here.

739
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,410
Look,I gotta go.

740
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,910
I wasn't expecting you.

741
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,210
I know.

742
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,020
What's going on?

743
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,650
I did what youaid.

744
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,270
So you went to see nick?

745
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,650
Yes,but I saw lisa insteaD.

746
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,730
So I'm gonna still have to wait for you to close the book on this guy?

747
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,770
No.

748
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,980
When daddy named nick as his successor,

749
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,950
I wasn't just upset because I thought I deserv to be president of darling enterprises.

750
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,910
Even though you do.

751
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,850
I do.

752
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,470
I was upset because...

753
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,880
because there is a tiny part of me that always thought

754
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,720
if nick ever did take over the company,

755
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,740
it would be because...

756
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,580
he'd married me.

757
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:39,640
But after hearing lisa and what she had to say,it seems.

758
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:44,380
the nick that I fell in love with,he's not really there anymore.

759
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,270
But you are.

760
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,140
And I don't want to lose you.

761
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,290
Well,you'll never have to worry about that.

762
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,270
As long as you want me,I'm here.

763
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,150
And maybe when you finally do let go of the past.

764
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,080
All of it.

765
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,350
It'll give you the chance to open yourself up to even greater possibilities.

766
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,450
Like what?

767
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,460
Like marrying me.

768
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,860
Okay,what the hell did you do to my witness?

769
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,140
What witness?

770
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,010
I just got a call from clare george.

771
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,050
She says she's not gonna testify now.

772
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,830
Well,you should send her a subpoena.

773
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,780
Oh,right.

774
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,160
She's a french citizen living abroad.

775
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,070
- You can'T.
- You know what?

776
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,450
I should have you arrested for witness tampering.

777
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,660
You can't charge me for talking to my mother.

778
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,850
You done,counselor?

779
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,410
Not even close.

780
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,430
I-I keep waiting for this to die.

781
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,580
It never does.

782
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,480
Take it away.

783
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,480
Letitia.

784
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,720
Oh,you know,I spend so much time at home now,I notice these things.

785
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,150
Have you come to yell at me again?

786
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,570
Because I won't brook it.

787
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,930
No,I came to apologize.

788
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:20,420
You were right about my mother,everything you said about her.

789
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,660
I'm sorry,nick.

790
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,110
I take no pleasure in that.

791
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,260
I should go.

792
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,480
I haven't even been home yet.

793
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,820
Nick.

794
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,330
I know I'm not your mother,but I tried to be.

795
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,350
I never asked you to.

796
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,300
I know.

797
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,960
But if you could've seen yourself at 6,this little boy without a mother,

798
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,240
wandering around our house.

799
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:56,860
pushing your little briefcase on wheels around.

800
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,980
so full of need.

801
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,630
I loved you.

802
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,220
And I still do,nicky.

803
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,310
Can't you feel that?

804
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,620
Can't you?

805
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,030
I can't tonight.

806
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,390
Bad day?

807
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,110
Let's just say it wasn't prime.

808
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,360
What happened?

809
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,180
Look,I know you can't talk to me about mom's case.

810
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:42,600
Just give me the heart stuff,big picture.

811
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,420
Okay.

812
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,980
The most important thing in my life is my work.

813
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,000
I don't have a husband.

814
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:49,940
I don't have kids.

815
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,260
You have a secret boyfriend.

816
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,910
Yes,I have a secret boyfriend and my work,

817
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,050
and when my work doesn't go well,when I don't have that.

818
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,950
I don't know what I have left.

819
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,950
That'S.

820
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:08,970
my life.

821
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,280
That's the big picture.

822
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,680
Isn't sharing fun?

823
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,470
You want to go see the weepies?

824
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,880
I told you we cannot go out.

825
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,280
Who said anything about going out?

826
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,100
Nola,weepies.

827
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,080
Weepies,nola.

828
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,930
They've all signed confidentiality agreements.

829
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,170
Mum is the word.

830
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,380
You're criminal.

831
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,230
May I?

832
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,690
Did you see your mom?

833
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,840
Yeah,I did.

834
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,180
Go back to sleep,okay?

835
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,070
Okay.

836
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,170
- Sweet dreams.
- Night,dad.
