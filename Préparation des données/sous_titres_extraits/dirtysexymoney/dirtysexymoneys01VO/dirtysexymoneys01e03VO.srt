1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,550
My father worked as a lawyer for
the richest family in New York

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,550
Until his plane went
down in Long Island Sound.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,630
He left me his biggest client,

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,230
The Darlings... Tripp, the
empire builder...

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,970
So you knew about the affair
between Letitia and my father?

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,900
Of course.

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,140
Letitia, the sophisticated socialite

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,140
Patrick, the principal politician

9
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,860
I don't want to run for senate.

10
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,870
I think that you should run.

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,170
What do you want to do?

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,810
Karen, the professional divorcee.

13
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,380
Nick is my past,
you're my future okay?

14
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,650
Brian, the man of god...

15
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,490
I lied to my wife and
daughters last night.

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,990
I told them that you were an orphan.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,060
Does he speak English?

18
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,600
No, uh, just Swedish.

19
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,080
And Jeremy and Juliet,
the well-behaved twins.

20
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,940
Don't lie to me, Jeremy,
Especially about Natalie Kimpton.

21
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,070
I want you.

22
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,070
If Juliet find out.

23
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,470
She won't find out.

24
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,190
My father is gathering information
on billionaire, Simon Elder

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,400
If i were kinda figure out
who killed my father

26
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,820
That's the guy i'd start with.

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,360
You have to eat good food.

28
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,700
I'm putting the carrots in your lunch.

29
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,400
Uh, dad. Yuck!

30
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,100
I mean, they taste like toe-nails.

31
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,030
How do you know what toenails
taste like? That not right.

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
Why is Patrick Darling on tv?

33
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,110
Because he is running for
the United States Senate.

34
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,770
So you're willing to go on record
that you have never committed adultery?

35
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,990
Ever since i got married,
i've done nothing, Lara,

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,710
But be faithful to my wife

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,780
And try to set a fine moral example for
my children and all the people of New York.

38
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,620
So Patrick's really running?

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,510
Tripp got what he wanted.

40
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,140
He usually does.

41
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,210
You know, i think he'll
make a great senator.

42
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,820
Okay, i think that's enough TV.

43
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,430
Why don't you go get your book report
and finish getting ready for school?

44
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,880
Okay.

45
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,220
Are you sure going to the police about
simon elder is a safe thing to do?

46
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,100
Don't you think you might
need a little more evidence

47
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,970
Before accusing the richest man
in the world of being a murderer?

48
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,450
Look, lisa, the evidence i
have is the evidence i have.

49
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,410
What do you want me to
do, just wait and see?

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,930
I can't.

51
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,740
You can ask Tripp for help.

52
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,340
You agreed to represent the family.

53
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,610
It's the least he can do.

54
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,650
Yes, but can i trust him?

55
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,080
Maybe.

56
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,010
So being Tripp Darling's trusted advisor doesn't
have a whole lot to do with trust, does it?

57
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,630
Until i find out who killed my dad, no.

58
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,760
Morning, clark.

59
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,240
Good morning, mr. George.

60
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,980
So what, tripp thinks
if he sends the rolls,

61
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,800
I'll take the ride to work?

62
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,040
Hop in, nicky.

63
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,560
What, did you just wake up?

64
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,540
Oh, god, no.

65
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,490
I haven't slept a wink.

66
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,670
What's the matter?

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,350
I'm tormented by the thought that
Simon Elder could've had something
to do with that plane ing down.

68
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,670
We have to do something.

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,480
Well, i'm seeing the police later today.

70
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,040
The police?

71
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,850
I don't think the police will
be much help with simon elder.

72
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,660
A man in that kind of
position, the police can't really...

73
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,110
I mean, i think he's... he's
probably pretty much untouchable.

74
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,370
I could have someone look into it.

75
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,270
No, that's all right. Thanks.

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,220
Your dad had a private investigator
that we used a couple of times...

77
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,480
Tripp, here's what i
think we should do...

78
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,200
I think we should let the
police handle the matter,

79
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,060
Let them decide whether or not
there's reason for suspicion.

80
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,690
That's what i think we should do.

81
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,910
Clark, right here, please.

82
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,040
You still think someone in our
family could've been responsible?

83
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:27,770
I didn't say that.

84
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,780
Personally, i think the dossier your dad
complied on simon elder was pretty damning.

85
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,320
Well, and i'm bringing it
into the police later today.

86
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,710
Yeah... i just have to
be able to do it my way.

87
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,180
Please.

88
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,270
Okay.

89
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,910
Look, i'm just gonna run home from here.

90
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,310
I'll see you later this morning. Okay?

91
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,430
You take care of yourself. Okay?

92
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,960
Daisy, i need you to go on the internet and find
out all the information you can on simon elder.

93
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,220
I want interviews, profiles, corporate
reports...

94
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,180
Anything you can find.

95
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,830
No problem.

96
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,860
And i also need you to make one copy
of every piece of paper in this dossier.

97
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,140
I have to bring it to the police later.

98
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,090
No problem.

99
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,200
And i don't want to be bothered by
anyone for at least the next hour.

100
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,080
Problem!

101
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,550
Rebecca colfax, darling family publicist.

102
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,740
Well, i'm charmed all over again.

103
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,560
Rebecca Colfax is here for you.

104
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,670
Yeah, i see. Thanks, Daisy.

105
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,950
What's up?

106
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,810
This.

107
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,300
The call came into my
office at 2:00 a.m. For Tripp.

108
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,000
Why is Tripp getting
calls at your office?

109
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,700
Guess they didn't have his home number.

110
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,640
What a surprise. Listen up.

111
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,740
Hey, Mr. Darling, just
thought you might want to know

112
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,640
There's a pretty raunchy sex tape
gonna hit the web at midnight thursday

113
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,650
If you don't pay me
one million American.

114
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,570
Mm-hmm, you tall poppy, that's
right, one bloody mil.

115
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,540
Turn it down, Rache!

116
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,790
Wouldn't be too good for your little
Patty's senate campaign, now would it?

117
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,870
Wait to hear from me.

118
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,470
Oh, i got you by the natties now, mate.

119
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,290
Uh, so wait, have you told
tripp about this yet?

120
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,720
- Not yet.
- Good. Don't.

121
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,800
Did you contact the police?

122
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,090
I'm contacting you.

123
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,010
Until this thing becomes
a matter of public record,

124
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,790
Which it won't if you do
your job, it's a legal problem.

125
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,660
It's not an after-school spin project.

126
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,210
Besides, Patrick's campaign
launches tomorrow night,

127
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,900
And between the good press and the bad
prs, i'm kinda up to my knees in freaks.

128
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,660
Yeah.

129
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,420
Well, let's just think for a second.

130
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,780
Do we even know that
this tape actually exists?

131
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,140
Think about it.

132
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,290
Patrick Darling...

133
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,870
I'll talk to him.

134
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,040
Patrick.

135
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,370
I saw your little performance
on Lara Cumberland.

136
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,000
Come on, son.

137
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,030
You can't spend your whole
campaign fielding questions about...

138
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,490
What do you call it?

139
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,730
I mean, it's gonna come
out, this sex thing.

140
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,660
I-i tried to talk policy, dad.

141
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,300
She... she
pushed.

142
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,380
Yeah, somebody's gonna shove.

143
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,980
What do you think i should do?

144
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,460
I'm sure you have a detailed plan.

145
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,180
Patrick...

146
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,560
You can do great things if we can
win this election, great things.

147
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,600
You have to get your house in order.

148
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,450
You have to let this person go.

149
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,730
Right.

150
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,920
Thanks.

151
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,270
Juliet darling, is it true you got banned
from the Argyle for starting a fire?

152
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,950
That was an accident.

153
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,570
Isn't this really about Natalie Kimpton?

154
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,010
You hate each other so much, you
can't even stay in the same hotel?

155
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,150
Is that what she said?

156
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,740
Oh, no.

157
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,900
She said you're "a small-minded
fashion victim," end quote.

158
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,060
Do you have a comment to that?

159
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,860
I have never wanted anything
but good things for Natalie.

160
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,780
I wish her success and happiness.

161
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,440
Peace out. Bring the boys home.

162
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,660
Hey... Jeremy.

163
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,200
You know what would be so random?

164
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,790
Me going to Patrick's bash.

165
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,950
No.

166
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,970
You and Jules at the same
party can never happen, ever.

167
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,160
If she even suspects
we're seeing each other...

168
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,530
But, Jeremy...

169
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,570
There's a diamond necklace
there that i would kill for.

170
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,800
And people get to take
whatever they want, right?

171
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,050
I'll buy you the necklace.

172
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,030
No!

173
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,130
I don't want you to buy
it. I want it for free.

174
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,650
Paying for stuff sucks.

175
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,140
Natalie...

176
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,280
No.

177
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,920
You got my sister
thrown out of the hotel.

178
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,110
I did not.

179
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,470
I saw you talking to the manager.

180
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,910
It was about my smoothies.

181
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,120
They were putting in
way too much banana.

182
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,390
You don't seem to mind when
i put in too much banana.

183
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,000
So i hate to ask you
this, but you've never...

184
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,360
Filmed yourself performing a sexual
act, ever, with ellen or... or anyone?

185
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,290
No.

186
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,510
Not with carmelita?

187
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,790
Nick, what part of "No"
do you not understand?

188
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,150
Just be completely honest with me, Pat.

189
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,670
I am being completely honest with you.

190
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,410
I never made any sex tape.

191
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,700
I mean, quite frankly, i don't
find them to be very romantic.

192
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,690
Okay.

193
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,030
Uh, well, do you think it's possible that

194
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,220
Somebody could've filmed you
without your knowledge for...

195
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,680
Nick, did anyone ever say that
it was actually me on the tape?

196
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,930
Did someone ever...
did they say that?

197
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,490
No.

198
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,190
We just
assumed that...

199
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,950
Well, there it is, nick.

200
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,680
You assume, you make an
ass out of you and me.

201
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,970
That one's for free.

202
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,950
Don't go. I just got home.

203
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,050
I have to. I've gotta go to russian.

204
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,740
- Don't you mean russia?
- No.

205
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,610
I started taking russian for
the space tourism program.

206
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,720
I have to know what
it means if they say...

207
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:46,890
What does that mean?

208
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,780
Open the air lock, Ivan.

209
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,830
- Catherine, can i please be done unpacking?
- Yes.

210
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,320
Thank you.

211
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,730
What's going on with you lately?

212
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,470
What? Nothing.

213
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm sensing some sort of weird vibe.

214
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,290
You know how my twin-tuition gets
really good a month before our birthday?

215
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,210
There's no such thing as twin-tuition.

216
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,770
Yes, there is...

217
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,260
And you know it.

218
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,430
Like the time you fell into the wall
at elton john's estate, and i knew,

219
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,430
Or when you broke your wrist
at tennis camp, and i knew.

220
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,740
I called you from my cell phone.

221
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,280
Yeah, but i knew you were gonna call.

222
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,620
So you think simon elder, the
billionaire philanthropist,

223
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,370
Blew up your father's plane?

224
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,890
I'm exploring the possibility.

225
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,350
The guy who loves everybody and
stamps out hunger and a.i.d.s.

226
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,820
And everything had it
in for your dear old dad?

227
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,080
Do you know where i
might find angelina adams?

228
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,590
She was the detective that i
spoke with at the crash site.

229
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,710
She got transferred.

230
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,870
So what was his motive, you think?

231
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,680
Did your father even know mr. Elder?

232
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,780
I'm not sure.

233
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,890
I'm just asking you can look and
see if there's a possible connection.

234
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,330
Look, a-all of this was
in my father's briefcase.

235
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,620
There's... there's
evidence here that

236
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,350
Elder's application for alien employment
certification was tampered with

237
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
When he entered the country
from russia back in 1979.

238
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,020
And... and here on his
information disclosure statement,

239
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,400
Which he signed when he
patented his prism processor,

240
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,710
He failed to disclose prior art.

241
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,100
Do you know what that means?

242
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,570
Could've been someone else's idea?

243
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,770
It could be he stole someone else's
idea and my father knew about it.

244
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,130
You know what, mr. George?

245
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,360
Can i keep ts for a day?

246
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,060
Yeah, sure.

247
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,760
And i'll have our people look 'em
over, and we'll get back to you.

248
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,770
I mean, look, it may mean nothing.

249
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,370
It may. You never know.

250
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,710
It may.

251
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,540
I'll call you tomorrow.

252
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,030
Hey, daisy, i'll be there in ten.

253
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,070
Rebecca colfax, family publicist.

254
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,860
You ever get tired of saying that?

255
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,610
Our aussie friend just sent me an
e-mail outling his requirements.

256
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,580
He wants the money hand
delivered,5:00 p.m. Tomorrow, pier 21,

257
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,280
Exactly one hour before the
campaign launch at bulgari.

258
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,710
And we know the tape
exists now, einstein.

259
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,620
There was an audio file
attached to the e-mail.

260
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,330
A recording of the sex tape, huh?

261
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,050
Yeah.

262
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,210
It's pretty rough, but you can
definitely hear someone say "patty,"

263
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,170
And it sounds about 50% like a dude.

264
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,680
Well, i've spoken with patrick.

265
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,450
And?

266
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,010
And he claims he never made a sex tape.

267
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,330
Says they're not romantic.

268
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,360
Let me let you in on a little
secret about the darlings, nick.

269
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,570
They lie.

273
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,990
So i'm just asking you
to be honest with me.

274
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,220
Have you ever made a sex tape?

275
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,300
Nick...

276
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,130
I-i tell you this with, um...

277
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,270
With a great sorrow.

278
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,960
But...

279
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,370
The only sex tapes i ever had
were the ones in my collection.

280
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,060
But you've never made a sex tape?

281
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,650
You mean like a mix tape?

282
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,780
Like the one you made
me when we were 12,

283
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,560
The one with "babe, i love you" on it.

284
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,060
Babe, i love you

285
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,340
No, karen, a sex tape.

286
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,500
That's impossible.

287
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,740
What do you mean, impossible?

288
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,560
Just that.

289
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,270
It is not possible.

290
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,500
Okay.

291
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,610
So you had a collection of sex tapes?

292
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,650
Yeah, but they were not of me.

293
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,990
They were of, like, celebrities.

294
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,080
Remember?

295
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,010
Babe, i love you

296
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,190
Nick, if i tell you something,

297
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,290
Do you promise not to tell anybody?

298
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,840
You have a sex tape of buddy ebsen?

299
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,970
Had.

300
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,030
It's probably juliet.

301
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,420
I'm a virgin.

302
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,650
That... that's...
that's a surprise.

303
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,580
Uh, a real, total virgin?

304
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,950
Yeah.

305
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,970
I've never even...

306
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,210
Well, anything.

307
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,450
Well, juliet, why
do you...

308
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,110
Let everyone think i'm a slut?

309
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,150
Yeah.

310
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,060
It's easier.

311
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,590
Okay, just to be sure...

312
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,810
Not even any kissing or touching or
heavy petting while a camera was on?

313
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,000
How do you live with yourself?

314
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,050
They all said no.

315
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,770
Told ya.

316
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,260
Patrick made the sex
tape. Patrick's lying.

317
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,290
Patrick's going to be the next lying president
of the united states of lying america.

318
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,280
Birds roost with their own kind.

319
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,550
So honesty will come home
to those who practice it.

320
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,170
Amen.

321
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,040
Amen.

322
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,130
You speak english?

323
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,520
No, he doesn't.

324
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,670
Not a word.

325
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,890
He saw me reading the bible.

326
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,950
And "amen" is the same in sweden.

327
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,480
Amen, right?

328
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,400
Amen?

329
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,340
Amen.

330
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,380
See, it's the same in sweden.

331
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,490
Honey, i'm as sorry
about this as you are.

332
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,580
I feel like a piece of trash.

333
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,750
You're not a piece of trash.

334
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,070
I know.

335
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,970
You just make me feel like one.

336
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,770
Me?

337
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,690
You're the one that told me to run.

338
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,330
Yeah, but i didn't... i didn't
think you'd break up with me.

339
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,710
I thought they were two
totally different issues.

340
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,430
Obviously they're not.

341
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,280
Wait, don't... please
don't go. Stay.

342
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,760
I can't.

343
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,660
Can't we just have one last nice time?

344
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,690
We already did.

345
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,690
We just didn't know it.

346
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,340
Hey, rebecca colfax, family publicist.

347
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,500
We know.

348
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,480
Once we set your meeting with our
aussie slime, he sent the dinky-di.

349
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,860
Dinky-di?

350
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,790
It's aussie for "the real thing.

351
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,710
It goes public day after tomorrow
unless we come up with the moola.

352
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,990
That means "money.

353
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,050
It's showtime, folks.

354
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,620
What the hell are they doing?

355
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,820
The italian banker.

356
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,300
How do you know that?

357
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,000
Uh, the reverse italian banker.

358
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,750
Oh, caddie.

359
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,720
Well, i hate to say it, but i guess
you were right about the lying.

360
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,140
Good thing it's not patrick.

361
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,170
Well, it's good for him.

362
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,350
It's the same for the campaign.

363
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,720
It's... the darling family name
is still the darling family name.

364
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,950
We've still gotta pay.

365
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,540
Oh, my god!

366
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,080
Just turn it off!

367
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,650
Any luck with the police?

368
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,660
Yeah.

369
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,060
Provisionally, actually.

370
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,140
They're gonna look into it.

371
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,110
You showed 'em the documents
that were in your dad's briefcase?

372
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,660
I did, and they're gonna look 'em over.

373
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,590
The originals?

374
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,170
No, of course not. Copies.

375
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,530
Oh, well, i mean, it's a
surprise, but it's... it's a good one.

376
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,060
I'm pleased.

377
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,120
You still don't believe, do you, that
i had nothing to do with this?

378
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,690
Honestly, uh, i'm not sure.

379
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,530
Secretary of state for you, sir.

380
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,370
Thank you, helen.

381
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,020
Your dad was my roommate at yale.

382
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,670
He was my bestriend, ever.

383
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,930
Tripp, don't you need to get that?

384
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,440
In a second.

385
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,360
He was the first person i hired when
my dad put me in charge of the family.

386
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,680
He saved me from certain death twice,

387
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,510
Once in the mentawais islands and once when
we were up in saskatchewan hunting moose.

388
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,220
I took a stray bullet in the leg.

389
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,670
He carried me on his back
61/2 miles to the lodge.

390
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,320
There is no way that i
would've wanted him dead.

391
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,500
Not even knowing he had an affair
with your wife for 40 years?

392
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,460
I didn't know.

393
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,180
You're gonna have to start
trusting me sometime or...

394
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,630
This... this is
not gonna work.

395
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,880
Tripp darling.

396
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,990
Hey, condi.

397
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,520
No, i-i had the occasion to hear
your cousin constance speak.

398
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,330
Wh-what clarity of vision.

399
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,690
What... what an extraordinary family
you have, madam secretary. Yeah.

400
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,380
She was thrilling.

401
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,320
It is your sister again.

402
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,980
Will you grab it for me?

403
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,570
She'll just keep calling if you don't.

404
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,290
Jeremy. Hmm?

405
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,590
You're a very handsome, very cool guy.

406
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,640
You don't need your
sister 24 hours a day.

407
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,620
Disconnect.

408
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,630
Last time we did it, you
talked to lilo the whole time.

409
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,130
That was different.

410
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,460
She was bummed.

411
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,200
Hey, sis.

412
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,360
I've left, like, three messages.

413
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,910
I'm sorry. I've been kind of tied up.

414
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,320
What are you doing?

415
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,540
I'm chillin' with some freaks.

416
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,990
What should i wear tonight
to the campaign launch?

417
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,370
A burnoose or something. Shake it up.

418
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,750
Jeremy, are you even listening to me?

419
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,580
Jeremy?

420
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah, i'm listening.

421
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,550
Fine. Whatever. Perf. Bye.

422
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,630
Bye.

423
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,040
This... this is not
gonna end well.

424
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,040
So, all right, i made a sex tape.

425
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,630
It's not like it's against the law.

426
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,690
Well, i'm not saying it's
against the law, karen.

427
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,550
It's just, you... youied
to me.

428
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,400
I hurt your feelings.

429
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,710
- No, karen- -
oh, i'm sorry, nick.

430
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,680
I-i won't do that again.

431
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,970
Who's the y?

432
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,240
Why?

433
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:53,970
You a little jealous?

434
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,470
- Karen- - just
a little bit?

435
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,270
Look, karen, i am just trying to figure out a way to
get around shelling out $1 million for this thing.

436
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,370
That's it.

437
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,890
Okay. It's freddy's caddie.

438
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,410
What?

439
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,510
It's freddy's caddie.

440
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,370
Freddy's caddie?

441
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,030
Oh, well, that explains that.

442
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,730
Explains what?

443
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,500
Caddie. Patty.

444
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,340
- Uh, nothing. Nothing.
- Okay.

445
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,910
I just...

446
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,780
I need you to promise me that
he won't find out about this.

447
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,560
Freddy?

448
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,450
No. Daddy.

449
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,960
He doesn't know it's
me on the tape, right?

450
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,690
He doesn't know there'a tape.

451
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,020
So you lied for me?

452
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,890
Yeah, i omitted a few things.

453
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,720
Nick... Thank you.

454
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,140
You are so sweet.

455
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,290
All right, here's
what you need to do...

456
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,280
Go to the bowery branch at fortunato
brothers and ask for paulo vova.

457
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,550
Paulo vova?

458
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,460
And he's just gonna give me $1 million?

459
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,160
He's never met me.

460
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,440
Well, nick, if i go in and ask him for money
to pay off a blackmailer for a sex tape,

461
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,810
He's just gonna go and tell
daddy like he did last time.

462
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,750
Really appreciate this.

463
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,020
I know it's short notice.

464
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,610
Not at a, mr. George.

465
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,710
This is why we're here.

466
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,820
I was very sorry, by the
way, to hear about your father.

467
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,190
We were friends.

468
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,180
He was...

469
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,940
He was a good man.

470
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,800
Thank yo

471
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,150
All of this money
belongs to the darlings?

472
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,420
Si.

473
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,190
And the have vaults like
this all over the city.

474
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,500
- Do i need to tell
you why- - no. No.

475
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,160
Is none of my business, mr. George.

476
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,560
I never asked your father.

477
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,460
I will never ask you.

478
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,330
Thank you, paolo.

479
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,140
Mr. Vova, please. I'm a banker.

480
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,660
An italian banker.

481
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,150
Yes, i am very familiar
with the sexual position.

482
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,380
It was named for my grandfather.

483
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,040
Okay enough.

484
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,000
Thanks, steven.

485
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,390
Do you know how much love i've
given up to be in this family...

486
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,470
To be who my dad wants me to be?

487
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,440
How much love and simple affection?

488
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,300
Sweet nectar.

489
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,700
Mr. Darling, you have a speech
to make in less than an hour.

490
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,310
Enough love for ten lifetimes.

491
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,430
Two more potcheens, steven.

492
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,620
Funny thing is, i'm not allowed
to be loved for who i really am.

493
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,410
Poor people...

494
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,950
Nobodies...

495
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,130
Regular beings that only god sees, they
can be loved for who they are, but not me.

496
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,820
Because you know why?

497
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,270
We should really go, sir.

498
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,990
Because i'm a scion.

499
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,680
I'm a darling twig, a tender
sot that's stuck to a tree...

500
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,960
That i cannot live witut.

501
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,060
So... Here's to the tree.

502
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,470
Here's to the tree, clark.

503
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,520
Here's to the tree...

504
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,980
That's killing me.

505
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,370
Come on.

506
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,070
Let's go, mr. Darling.

507
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,430
Okay. I'm gonna drive, though.

508
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,920
I'm at least gonna
be in control of that.

509
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,240
Sir. Sir.

510
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,330
Come on.

511
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,700
Hey.

512
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,330
Are you mr. George?

513
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,990
Yeah.

514
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,480
Where's your boyfriend?

515
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,890
Something came up so he sent me.

516
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,670
All right, fine. Whatever.

517
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,210
Where's the tape?

518
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,200
I'm sorry.

519
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,160
This is really awkward.

520
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,240
What the hell is going on?

521
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,840
We can't sell you the tape.

522
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,670
What do you mean, you
can't sell me the tape

523
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,390
We don't have it no more.

524
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,450
You've gotta be kidding me.

525
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,950
I just went and got $1 million.

526
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,430
I have $1 million in this bag.

527
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:21,950
I know!

528
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,190
Look, maybe we could go and
get a cup of tea or something...

529
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,510
No, we can't go get a cup of tea!

530
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,250
I'm in a hurry. I have to be at
a police station in ten minutes.

531
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,060
What, about this?

532
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,540
No, about something else entirely.

533
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,560
So if you're playing some
kind of game with me...

534
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,560
I'm not.

535
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,880
We feel really blood
awful about this, mr. George.

536
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,160
This is not how we do business.

537
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,320
It's just that we got
a much bigger offer.

538
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,330
From who?

539
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,470
Who did you sell this tape to?

540
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,440
I don't know. We never even met them.

541
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,360
We just got a phone cal out of
the blue giving us instructions.

542
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,580
Put the tape into a
postbox, and that was that.

543
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,470
God help me.

544
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,040
Well, i hope this doesn't affect any
future business that we might do, mr. George.

545
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,160
Oh, i'm sure it won't.

546
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,950
No, it's all good!

547
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,810
That's it? You're done?

548
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,410
We looked at the materials, Mr. George,

549
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,150
And there's nothing in there that
really incriminates simon elder.

550
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,780
And you did all of this in one day?

551
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:10,330
Look, you said yourself that the stuff from
your father's briefcase may not mean anything.

552
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,420
And your instincts were
right on the money.

553
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,480
Did detective adams get
transferred off this case

554
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,170
Because she was willing to look into things
that you're obviously being paid not to?

555
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,030
Detective adams followed her
actor boyfriend to los angeles.

556
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,630
What are you gonna do?

557
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,520
Women.

558
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,900
Hello.

559
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,980
Uh, mr. George? Yeah.

560
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,640
It's Clark, the driver.

561
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,140
Hey, Clark. What's up?

562
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,990
I'm up here at, uh,
86th and 2nd avenue.

563
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,700
Yeah. What's the problem?

564
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,060
I've got Patrick up here.

565
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,910
He's, uh...

566
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,200
I'm not going, Nicky! I won't go!

567
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,470
He's in a bit of a state.

568
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,890
"Tell him i'm not going!"

569
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,920
I'll be there as soon as i can.

570
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,060
Hey, there's his wife.

571
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,970
Hey, Ellen!

572
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,910
Ellen, Ellen, where is the candidate?

573
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,120
Oh, he'll be here shortly.

574
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,170
He's just putting some
last touches on his speech.

575
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,420
Thank you.

576
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,400
Juliet, right here!

577
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,900
Bonsoir.

578
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,530
Juliet, how do you feel about your 
brother running for Senate?

579
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,070
Well, he's the best!

580
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,460
Oh, my god!

581
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,920
Oh, my god...

582
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,120
What is she doing here?

583
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,010
She, uh, she must be a supporter.

584
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,600
Natalie Kimpton!

585
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:46,590
Does your appearance at Patrick Darling's
fund-raiser mean that you 
and Juliet have made up?

586
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,890
When she's ready to
apologize, i'm ready to listen.

587
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,400
This is so utterly debasing.

588
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,560
We have to get her off the list.

589
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,380
She's already on the red carpet, Jules.

590
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,270
Oh, god!

591
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,640
Oh, i want to go home!

592
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,380
No, no, no. Look, it's a big store.

593
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,760
It's a big store. You
won't even see her. Okay?

594
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,390
Trust me.

595
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,320
Go, Patrick!

596
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,780
Thanks for not taking him in.

597
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,710
No problem.

598
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,870
I used to do the same
thing for your dad.

599
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,290
Helps keep the press out of the picture.

600
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,470
Patrick.

601
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,590
Nick, how you doing?

602
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,330
You were supposed to be
at bulgari 20 minutes ago.

603
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,190
You're giving a speech
ten minutes from now.

604
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,640
Oh, no, i'm not.

605
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,450
Patrick.

606
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,710
I can't do it without her.

607
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,930
I'm really sorry about this, guys, but
i'm gonna have to take someone in.

608
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,270
Too many witnesses.

609
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,680
I got it.

610
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,930
What are you doing, Clark?

611
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,760
Standard procedure. I'll be fine.

612
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:41,610
How the hell are we gonna get you
to this fund-raiser in seven minutes?

613
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,670
We'll get you there, Mr. George.

614
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,630
Do you know what
Carmelita did for me once?

615
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,440
I don't think i want to hear.

616
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,280
She made me 30 pairs of underwear
with my favorite yankees on the butt...

617
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:56,010
Thurman, reggie, yogi.

618
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,420
Th-that's love.

619
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,120
What kind of a jerk throws that away?

620
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,100
All right, pat, listen, you got
to pull yourself together.

621
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,380
Don't you tell me to
pull myself together, nick,

622
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,580
Because that's what my dad always says.

623
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,970
Pull yourself together, pat.

624
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,870
Pull yourself together, pat.

625
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,070
All right. I'm sorry.

626
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,240
I mean, that's why your dad was so cool.

627
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,980
He never told anybody to
pull themselves together.

628
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,500
He would say,"let
yourself go," you know?

629
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,970
I love that.

630
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,990
God, it's so exhausting, nick...

631
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,800
Always disappointing him.

632
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,970
I mean, i can't even imagine what
it's like to just be yourself,

633
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,150
To just do something and have
your dad say, you know,"great job.

634
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,950
You... Y-you...

635
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,580
You're good.

636
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,800
It's great, right?

637
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,780
It's a great feeling?

638
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,860
Yeah, i guess.

639
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,690
Dutch was so... was
so proud of you, nick.

640
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,190
You must know that, right?

641
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,230
I know he was proud of me.

642
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,410
I didn't give him very many
opportunities to say it.

643
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,320
Does anybody get life right?

644
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,460
I don't know.

645
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,030
I just know that no
matter what, tomorrow...

646
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,340
Is another day, another
opportunity, another chance.

647
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,160
I like that.

648
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,110
He speaks english.

649
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,420
Who?

650
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,460
The
orphan... gustav?

651
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,240
Complimentary watch?

652
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,520
And very well, not just "Amen".

653
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,440
No, thank you.

654
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,790
Oh, wait...

655
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,190
Thanks.

656
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,340
Well, what did he say?

657
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,570
He said to the twins,

658
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,270
"how come the sponge eats burgers
underwaterand the buns don't get soggy?"

659
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,400
Really?

660
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,560
That lying little street urchin.

661
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,180
Who knows if he's even an orphan?

662
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,290
I'm gonna talk to him, and
i'm gonna find out.

663
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,600
This really cheeses me off.

664
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,970
What do you think of these?

665
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,170
Transplendent.

666
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,360
Wait, what about these?

667
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,700
Even better. Maximum.

668
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,550
You don't think they're too big?

669
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,620
Well, you... you look
a little like a fly,

670
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:13,010
But that... that's not
all bad. Bugs are cool.

671
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,770
I can't focus.

672
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,030
Maybe they're prescription?

673
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,510
Having natalie here
is driving me insane.

674
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,210
I'm getting shingles.

675
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,130
You just go ahead and
you forget about her.

676
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,690
I can't.

677
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,340
Not with every third yahoo
in here coming up to me,

678
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,460
Making sure i know she's here.

679
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,590
Throw her out.

680
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,150
What? I can't. It's not my place.

681
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,570
You like her!

682
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,220
What... is... is this the
whole twin-tuition thing?

683
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,320
Because i think that you
are being kinda jammed.

684
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,730
I don't need twin-tuition
to see you googling her ass.

685
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,270
Don't... don't you
mean "ogling"?

686
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,460
Whatever! I'm gonna throw it out.

687
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,990
You can't just kick me out
'cause of some stupid perfume!

688
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,950
Oh, well, it's not about the perfume.

689
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,480
So it's true.

690
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,090
Darling natalie" was
intended as a joint release?

691
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,130
No!

692
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,800
No!

693
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,530
I always knew it was
gonna be "daring natalie.

694
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,790
And then she was all,"put
in the 'l,' put in the 'l'.

695
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,930
That is such a lie.

696
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,610
It was supposed to
celebrate our friendship!

697
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,400
Get... get her off
of me! She's feral!

698
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:21,520
Oh, i don't even care
about your stupid perfume!

699
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,420
You stole my bangs, and
i will never forgive you!

700
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,540
Oh, my god!

701
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,140
Bangs? It's all about bangs?

702
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,400
Who had the bangs first?

703
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,520
You can't even pull off bangs anyway!

704
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,700
- Look at your face!
- What?

705
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,450
That's enough! That's
enough! Settle down, both of you!

706
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,660
- Settle down!
- She started it.

707
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,100
You did! Whore!

708
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,440
Hey, you shut up!

709
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,890
You do not crash my brother's party
and aclike such a selfish freak.

710
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,650
It's not cool.

711
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,090
Oh, my god. The police.

712
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,960
Well, at least he's here.

713
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,860
Good evening.

714
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:01,100
I hope i'm not too late to talk about the
future of the greatest city in america.

715
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,380
So what did i miss?

716
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,150
To all the new families that arrive at
this city every single day from places

717
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,420
Like the dominican republic
and russia, china, jamaica,

718
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,500
My message remains the same.

719
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,300
Tomorrow ianother
day, another opportunity,

720
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,750
Another chance at the american dream.

721
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,980
So i thank you very much.
Thank you for coming.

722
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,800
And god bless america.

723
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,380
Thank you.

724
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,730
He's wonderful.

725
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,110
Hey, karen.

726
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,430
Karen, i'm sorry to bother
you guys, but can we talk?

727
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,680
Yeah. A-about what?

728
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,590
Oh, we're going to get sushi.

729
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,930
- You can just come and join us.
- No, no, no, no.

730
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,420
It's about the thing.

731
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,860
The sex tape?

732
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,250
Yeah. What, you told him?

733
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,490
She t... she
told you?

734
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,670
Well, i'm giving her a mulligan.

735
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,920
That's...
that's generous.

736
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,760
Well, see, now that's the
difference between you and me, nick.

737
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:06,080
I realize that nobody's perfect.

738
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,950
You, you're still trying.

739
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,130
Karen, someone else bought the tape.

740
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,340
- Who?
- I don't know.

741
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,560
And it's gonna be all over the
internet tomorrow. I'm sorry.

742
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,030
I did everything i could.

743
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,580
Baby, don't worry about
it. You'll survive.

744
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,310
I know, but daddy...

745
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,290
Well, look, if you want
me to, i'll tell him.

746
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,670
- Would you?
- Sure.

747
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,950
Oh, you're the best.

748
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,690
Oh, um...

749
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,870
Tell him i-i didn't know
there was a camera, okay?

750
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,170
- Okay
- okay.

751
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,560
Thank you.

752
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,860
I wish we had a pool up here.

753
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,890
That'd be amazing.

754
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,380
Little sore from your fisticuffs?

755
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,010
Yeah, a little bit.

756
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,510
I think i pulled a muscle.

757
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,530
But it was worth it because i think
i definitely connected a few times.

758
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,790
Yeah?

759
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,600
She's probably gonna have a shiner.

760
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,330
- Oh, yes.
- At lea a skinned knee.

761
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,310
Thank you for sticking up for me.

762
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,370
She was out of line. It's no big thing.

763
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,330
Well, it was huge.

764
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,730
It was the best.

765
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,830
I'm sorry that i said i
thought you had a ing for her.

766
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,170
Guess my twin-tuition's off this year.

767
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:41,300
Maybe us twins get older
and grow further apart.

768
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,030
They just get out of sync.

769
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,360
Yeah, it could happen.

770
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,040
Who's that?

771
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,420
Take it.

772
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,880
Nah.

773
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,890
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

774
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,750
Nick. Nick.

775
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,850
I just wanted to say thank you, nick.

776
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,450
I could've never given that
speech tonight without you.

777
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,600
Well, i'm glad i could help.

778
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,920
And that thing you said about tomorrow
being another day, another chance?

779
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:30,790
Yeah.

780
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,410
Well, you're right, nick.

781
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,980
I'm getting back
together with carmelita.

782
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,780
Well, pat, that... that's not
what i meant when i said...

783
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,120
You're good for a wise word, nick, but...

784
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,820
You can't hold me tight.

785
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,260
Well, can you just...

786
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,990
Give it a beat, think it through?

787
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,350
He has thought it through.

788
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,710
What can i tell you?

789
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,560
It's love.

790
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,640
Let yourself go, pat.

791
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,290
Thanks, nick. I will.

792
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,190
Dude, you're leaving?

793
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,050
What, are you going back to vegas?

794
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,360
Why should i stay here in traitorville?

795
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,710
She's my sister.

796
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,210
Really? And what am i, some
freak you chill with?

797
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,320
I think you're overreacting.

798
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,990
Really?

799
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,620
I didn't even get any swag.

800
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,210
Oh, i'm sorry.

801
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,500
I brought you this.

802
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,460
One bag?

803
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:37,370
You take her side, and you show
up here with one little bag?

804
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,640
I'm totally messing with you.

805
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,190
How's this for an apology?

806
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,710
It's a start.

807
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,950
- Young lady.
- Yes.

808
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,750
I just got off the phone with bulgari.

809
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,220
And they wanted to make
sure the delivery was okay.

810
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,100
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

811
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:13,550
Apparently they shipped someone in this family
hundreds of thousands of dollars of goods.

812
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,870
Well, it wasn't me.

813
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,030
Well, i don't know any other j. Darling

814
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,250
Who would spend that
kind of money on jewelry.

815
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,360
Do you?

816
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,450
- No.
- Okay.

817
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,950
Thank you, darling.

818
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,830
J. Darling, my foot!

819
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:42,330
I can't believe that you would betray
us like this after all we've done.

820
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,240
I mean, why would you lie about
not being able to speak english?

821
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,380
- But you're the
one- - never mind.

822
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,770
It doesn't matter.

823
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,140
Do you know how much we've spent 
at the swedish market so you could 
have your precious caviar?

824
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,990
What's caviar?

825
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,330
It's not about the caviar!

826
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,100
It's about...

827
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,400
The time that we've put in.

828
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,280
I mean, is your name even Gustav?

829
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,070
Tell me. Is it?

830
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,990
It is, isn't it?

831
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,890
- Huh?
- Good.

832
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,080
Well, at least you
were honest about that.

833
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,420
But remember, we pay the rent
in this house with honesty.

834
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,640
Don't make me raise your rent.

835
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,240
Do you really believe
his name is Gustav?

836
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,710
What choice do i have?

837
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,050
You know, at some point, you have
to just put your faith in humanity.

838
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:47,120
I gotta get to bible study.

839
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:56,450
You look like the good news
is i've got two days to live,

840
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,150
And the bad news is you were
supposed to tell me yesterday.

841
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,500
That it?

842
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:08,180
What, exactly? Speak.

843
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,940
The police found something?

844
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:14,770
No, they were useless. You were right.

845
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,570
I don't know if elder's people got to 'em
or if they're just too scared to try but...

846
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,680
I don't know. You were right.

847
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,350
Are you ready to let me help you?

848
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,110
You lied to me.

849
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,680
What are you talking
about? I never lied to you.

850
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,590
When did i lie to you?

851
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,600
When i opened my father's briefcase with
your wife's birth date as the combination,

852
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,590
You said you knew about the affair.

853
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,530
That wasn't a lie.

854
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,460
Well, then what the hell was it?

855
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:57,120
- That was a man- - i asked
if you knew, you said you did,

856
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,250
And then you said you didn't.

857
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,100
So... so which is it?
What's... what's the truth?

858
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:06,490
That was a man trying to save his life.

859
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,610
What'd you want me to
do, tell you that i'd...

860
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,310
Wasted 40 years trusting the two people

861
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,910
I thought were the most important
people in the world? Is that it?

862
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,080
Was that your truth?

863
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,120
I'm sorry.

864
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,900
'Ll figure it out. You help me take care
of my family, and we'll figure it out.

865
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:45,280
We'll find out who killed
your father. I promise.

866
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,370
All right.

867
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,470
- All right.
- Okay.

868
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,120
What's next?

869
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,950
Well, there's a sex tape
involving a family member

870
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,940
That's gonna come out
on the internet tomorrow.

871
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,520
Patrick?

872
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,260
No, Karen.

873
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:21,460
Mr. George, a second of your time.

874
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,330
Can i help you?

875
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,260
Here.

876
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:28,500
Inside you'll find all copyright documents
