1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,200
My father worked
as a lawyer

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,800
For the richest family
in new york

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,200
Until his plane went down
i>in long island sound.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,500
He left me his biggest client,
the darlings

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,500
The empire builder...
do you want to tell them why
you want to destroy my family,

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Or shall i?
Letitia,
i>the sophisticated socialite...

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,900
Which of our children
isn't mine?

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,700
Brian is your brother.
The man of god...

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,100
Brian darling is under arrest

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,100
For attempting to bribe
a public official.

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,900
The professional divorce...
my dad can never find out

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,800
Patrick,
the principled politician...

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,000
End things with carmelita,
or i will end

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Any shot you have
of a seat in the senate.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,200
And jeremy and juliet,
the well-Behaved twins.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
I wanthis girl
to like me for me.
You're a darling.

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,600
???

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Things are never
gonna be the same.
I told her i was an artist.

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,400
You need to stop lying
to this woman.
Could you just hook me up with,

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,800
What do you see
when you look at me

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
With the eyes
of a great painter?

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
We, i don't know
if i'd use the word great.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,400
Don't be modest.
Tell me.

24
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,700
Okay.

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,600
Um...

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
A peach.

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
A plum.

28
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,300
A road...
that goes on and on.

29
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,800
I can't wait for you
to paint me.

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,400
It's been two weeks.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You can't rush
the master, sofia.

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,400
I know.
You have your process.

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,700
No, it's not a process.
It's a way of life.

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,200
Unlike my desire,

35
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,600
Which i can expend on you
four times a day...

36
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,900
Five.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,200
My inspiration can't just
be turned on.

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,700
It needs time to build,

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,100
To gather.

40
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,000
And then it explodes
onto the canvas.

41
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,700
Does that inspire you?

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,800
I' start tomorrow.

43
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,900
Oh! Oh.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,800
It's been a while since
we did that in the morning.

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
I'll say.

46
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
Since we did that period.

47
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,900
Everything old
is new again.

48
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,200
Was it okay for you?
You seemed...

49
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,900
Are you kidding me?
That was sensational.

50
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,000
It's just, you know,
my leg is a little sore,that's all.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,700
Oh. You're still mad
i shot you.

52
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,100
No, i'm not, honey.
I'm just telling the truth.

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,700
My leg hurts
where you shot me,that's all.

54
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,100
From now on,it's nothing but the truth
between you and i, okay?

55
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,000
No more lies,
no more... carmelita.

56
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,900
Okay?

57
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah.

58
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,400
Get it.

59
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,100
I'm gonna take a shower.

60
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,200
(Whispers) carmelita,
stop calling. Please.
(Shower running)

61
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
I wrote you
ten e-Mails last night.

62
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,700
You never responded.

63
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, what's the matter?
I think i'm being followed.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,600
What exactly
makes you think that?
It's just a feeling.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,700
I got home
from class last night,

66
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,000
And things were just
out of place.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,500
I can't explain it.
I think someone had been here.

68
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Okay. I'll be over
as soon as i can. Bye.

69
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,200
Who the hell is that?

70
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,400
Robert russell.
The painter?

71
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Mm-Hmm.
Well, tell him
to go away.

72
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,900
I can't. He's having
second thoughts

73
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,400
About
the jeremy darling project.

74
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,300
Oh, it's a project now?

75
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,600
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,700
Jeremy is actually coming by
the gallery this morning

77
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,300
To learn from robert
how to draw

78
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,000
And to collect his five
works in progress of sofia

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,500
So he can fake being a painter
in real time,

80
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,600
And robert's starting to feel
like the whole thing

81
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,000
Is putting his integrity
at stake.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's pretty bad.
Welcome to life
with the darlings.

83
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,700
Hello.

84
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,400
Nick, it's simon elder.

85
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,300
Hey, simon. What's up?

86
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,700
Can you come over
to my office?

87
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,700
This morning?

88
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,600
Yeah. Say, 10:00?

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,600
Yeah, sure.
Is everything all right?

90
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,400
I'll tell you
when you get here.

91
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,500
It's, um,
it's a delicate matter.

92
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
I'll see you then.

93
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,000
Bye, nick.

94
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,600
What's so delicate?

95
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,500
You.

96
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,600
Hey. How about
some cherry lemonade?

97
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,600
Oh, yeah. I'd love some.

98
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,800
So what are you
doing tonight?

99
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
It's the annual "nutcracker"
evening with the darlings.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,400
It's a family tradition.
Oh, oh.

101
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,700
Why?
Well, i have someone important

102
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,900
Coming in from out of town
i'd like you to meet.

103
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,400
All right.
Then i'll be there. Done.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
Mmm.
That's perfection.

105
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,100
You really know
how to treat a girl.

106
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,000
Most peopl
want the same things--

107
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Suga..

108
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,800
Salt...

109
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Attention.

110
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,100
(Chuckles) you...

111
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,700
Are the best kser.

112
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
(Tripp) brian.

113
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,700
What are you doing here?

114
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,900
I came to tell you--

115
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,200
What,
that nothing's changed?

116
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,600
That's a lie.

117
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,800
That i'm still your son?
Lie.

118
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,900
That you still love me?

119
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,500
That was never true.

120
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,700
So maybe that's the one thing
that won't change.

121
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,200
No. Everything has changed.
Everything.

122
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,400
You're not my son.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,500
I spent most of your life
trying to find me in you,

124
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,100
And i never could.

125
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,200
Now we know why.

126
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,300
I loved your dad.

127
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,500
And i came to tell you
that i...

128
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,700
Look forward to having
this relationship with you.

129
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,100
Thanks.

130
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,600
I've got a meeting
to get to.

131
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,000
Reverend darling,

132
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,500
We've known each other
a while, yes?

133
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Ten long years.

134
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,000
And i watched you proudly

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,900
As you foundour own...
special way.

136
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,700
Unique.

137
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,300
You always did things
differently, brian.

138
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
That has been your blessing.

139
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,800
Thank you.

140
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,300
But this independent spirit
of yours

141
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,300
Is also your downfall.

142
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,900
Brian...

143
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,100
It pains me to have
this conversation with you.

144
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,400
Not as much
as it pains me.

145
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
In the same period of time

146
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,700
When you were righteously
ministering to your flock,

147
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,400
You initiated

148
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,400
A sexual relationship
with a parishioner,

149
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Fathered a child
out of wedlock

150
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,300
And most recently...

151
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,900
Bribed judge.

152
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,000
Itas an arbitrator,
actually.

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, brian.
I wanted to get my son back,

154
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,400
And his mother was gonna
whisk him away to stupid brazil,

155
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,300
And just--Ju when i started
to connect to him.

156
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,500
And you felt you had

157
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,100
But to commit a felony?

158
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,800
I'm sorry, brian.

159
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,400
The state board has decided
to suspe you for six months,

160
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,500
During which time,

161
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,600
You are expected
to undergo counseling

162
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
For sexual addiction

163
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,100
And attend a series
of workshops.

164
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,000
Who esn't love workshops?

165
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,000
Brian...

166
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,000
You have a lot
of work to do.

167
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,100
And you have
a lot of questions to ask yourself.

168
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,500
About what?

169
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,900
Whether you still feel called
to serve the lord.

170
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,100
So what's this all about?

171
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,400
Before i tell you,i want to make sure
that we're still cool.

172
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,200
We're okay.
I have some concerns.

173
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,100
About? Tell me.

174
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,600
Let's get it all out.

175
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,000
That night up at valhalla,
when tripp told his story

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,700
About your parents working
for the darling family,immigrating to russia.
Yeah?

177
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,500
It did leave me with
some questions about you

178
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
And your intentions
regarding the family.

179
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,200
I assure you,

180
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,900
The only connection they have
to my vision for new york--

181
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,500
Now, today--

182
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,800
Is that they're in the way.

183
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,200
But it's nothing personal.
It's not.

184
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,200
I'm listening.

185
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
I need you to--Well...

186
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,700
I would like for you
to get me copies

187
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,400
Of darling enterprises'
profit and loss statements for the last five years

188
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
And a list
of all their holdings.

189
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,000
Simon, the only people who have
access to that information

190
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
Are members of the fily.

191
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,000
You're part of the family,
right?

192
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,500
That's pretty sizeable
betrayal you're asking me
to perpetrate.

193
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,700
No. Don't think of it
as a betrayal.

194
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,700
It's synthesis.

195
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,700
Is that it?

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,900
Uh, no. No.
There is one more thing.

197
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,200
I have started
seeing someone romantically,

198
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,900
And i wanted to tell you.

199
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,700
So that i could
congratulate you?

200
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,800
It's karen dling.

201
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,000
Really?

202
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,600
Okay.

203
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,800
I know you two have
a history.

204
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,500
We do, but it's
pretty far back, really.

205
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,700
I'm more concerned

206
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,500
That this might be
some sort of plan of yours

207
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,400
To tear karen
away from tripp

208
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,700
The way thatou did
with patrick.

209
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,300
Patrick followed his heart.
It had nothing to do with me.

210
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,900
As for karen...
listen, i genuinely like her.

211
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,900
I think she's
a very dynamic woman.

212
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,400
But i won't pursue her

213
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,900
If it's gonna be a probl
for me and you.

214
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,300
Our relationship
is too important.

215
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,500
Is it gonna be a problem?

216
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,600
Why should it be?

217
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,400
Look, you're both adults.
It's fine.

218
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,500
Okay.

222
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,500
Is everybody excited
about "the nutcracker"?

223
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't think i'm gonna
be able to make it.
Why?

224
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,600
Because... i'm gonna be
out and about.

225
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,200
Karen...

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,300
It's "the nutcracker."

227
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,100
I'm sorry, mom,
but i'm nna be busy.

228
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,300
If she's busy,

229
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,000
She's busy.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,800
I think you're freaked out
about attending a family event

231
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,300
Without a lover
to protect you

232
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,500
From the intimacy
of your tribe.

233
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,400
You've been spending
so much time living from your swadhisthana,

234
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,800
You need to get up
into your anahata

235
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,600
And start feeling it.

236
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,100
I learned that
in the seychelles.

237
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,400
Honey, i'm reay starting
to regret

238
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,900
Giving you my honeymoon.

239
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,200
You know who really needs
a honeymoon? Oh, brian.

240
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,300
Poor guy.

241
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,600
I know. Mom, what are we
gonna do about that?

242
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
If i woke up tomorrow
and knew that

243
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,700
I didn't really belong here...
(whispers) i would kill myself.

244
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,000
Hang on. Hang on.Just because brian is not
my biological son

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,300
Does not mean
that he does not belong.
He's still your brother.

246
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Stop it.

247
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,600
Hello, dear.

248
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,900
Are you all
talking about me?
No.

249
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,000
I know.
We're not all related.

250
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm sorry. Not my fault.

251
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,900
There's somebody downstairs
for you, some guy.

252
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,800
Ha ha.
Okay.

253
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Oh, well, i-I don't know
what may have happened to her

254
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,500
On those distant green islands,

255
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,800
But it was certainly salutary.

256
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,100
Kai! You're here!
You made it.

257
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,300
I made it.
It was quite a journey.

258
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,300
How was your flight?
Did you fly first class?

259
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,500
I told 'em to make sure
that you flew first class.

260
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,400
Yes, i did,
and it was... wild.

261
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,800
I-I don't think i've ever
been treated this well

262
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,300
On land or in midair.

263
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,600
Uh, sir, may i take that bag
upstairs for you?

264
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,200
I'm okay, man.
Thank you very much.

265
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,600
I missed you so much.

266
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
I missed you, too.

267
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,200
Everything's falling apart

268
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
I've lost my wife,
my daughters,

269
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,800
My onetime mistress, my son.

270
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,600
I found out my father's
not my father,

271
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,900
And--And now
i've lost my job.

272
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,500
I mean, what's next,
leprosy?

273
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Yeah, it sounds to me
like you need to be patient.

274
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,000
The bishop has outlined
a program where...

275
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,600
Eventually you can
regain your post.

276
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,900
But i'm not sure
i want to.

277
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,800
Y-You're so good at it.

278
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,600
The sermon that you gave...
at karen's wedding--

279
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
It was fine.
I whipped itogether.

280
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,000
And those baptismal prayers

281
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,800
You wrote for patrick
and ellen's children,

282
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,900
Those--Those were published.
Because i'm a darling. Was.

283
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
Oh, brian--
You know what i mean.

284
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Well, you can't deny
you have a way of articulating

285
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,200
The questions that people have
about god and faith--

286
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,000
Because they're the questions
i've got, in spades.

287
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
The truth is,

288
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,800
I've never really felt
the presence of the lord

289
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,400
The way other people
say that they do.

290
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,300
Never? I find that
hard to believe.

291
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,000
Sure,
i get weepy at christmas,

292
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,300
The crucifixion
kind of gets to me,

293
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,300
But that's not the same
as actually having faith.

294
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,800
Do you think
this is all coming up

295
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,500
Because of recent
revelations?

296
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,300
Well, my so-Called brothers
and sisters are treating me

297
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,600
The way they always have, mom,
like an alien.

298
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,000
But this is about faith.

299
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,100
And i'm not sure
i ever really had any.

300
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, maybe you should talk
to your father, then.

301
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,100
He's not my father.

302
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,000
He raised you, brian.

303
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,000
Go to him.

304
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,000
He's more familiar with
these kinds of cosmic doubts

305
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,300
Than i am.

306
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,200
There.

307
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,100
Didn't that settle you down
a little?

308
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,400
Yeah, it did.

309
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,500
Thanks, mom.

310
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,000
Hey, where's picasso?

311
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,800
He'll be here
in a minute.

312
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
His name is robert russell,
and you better be nice to him

313
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,400
'Cause he's doing you
a big favor, all right?

314
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,300
Okay.

315
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,300
Whoa.

316
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,600
That is one big sponge.

317
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,200
Yeah, it just arrived
from berlin.

318
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,400
What do you clean with it?
Like, big art?

319
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,000
It is art, jeremy.
It just sold for $150,000.

320
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,500
I don't think
i'vever said this,

321
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,700
But that seems overpriced.

322
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,000
Maybe, maybe not.
Depends on who's buying it.

323
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,000
The way i see it,
is when you buy art,

324
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,300
You're buying a window.

325
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,400
When you look at the art,
whether it's a painting

326
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,600
Or a sculpture or whatever,
and you see through it

327
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,100
Into something new,
it's worth it.

328
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,000
I see a sponge.

329
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,500
Me, too.

330
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,100
(Juliet) i wish
you could stay forever.

331
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,100
But my uncle is
counting on me to come back.

332
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,900
Oh, it's just that...

333
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,600
Everything feels so different
with you here.

334
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,900
Well,
then we'll just make sure

335
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,600
We make
these two weeks last.

336
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,800
Okay.

337
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
(Tripp) financial statements
and a list of all our holdings?

338
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
So what do you
want me to do?

339
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,300
I think we should
give 'em to him.

340
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,200
Okay.

341
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,200
This is what
we've been waiting for.

342
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,800
Isn't this mr. Elder
showing us his hand?

343
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,700
Are you gonna have somebody
doctor the numbers?

344
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,700
'Cause if you are, i don't want
to take any part in that.

345
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,900
Nick, come on.

346
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,400
You know,
we're just gonna show him

347
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,900
What we want him to see.

348
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,500
I'll have the accountant
put together some papers.

349
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,600
Karen will bring them over
to your office, okay?

350
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,700
Nick.

351
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,200
Let everyadve

352
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,100
We have mr. Elder
exactly where we want him.

353
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
All right.

354
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,200
I'll see you later.

355
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,400
Simon elder just asked
for our financial reports.

356
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,100
Find out what he's up to, okay

357
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,400

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,400
Profit and loss statements
r darling enterpris

359
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,700
Going five years back.

360
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,500
Whatcha gonna do with 'em?

361
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,300
Nothing. I'm just making sure
everything is in order.

362
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,700
Nick, seriously, what are
you and daddy up to?

363
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,700
There's something
you're not telling me.

364
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,800
You're right, karen.
There is, and i'm not.

365
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
How's simon elder?

366
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,100
You heard about that?

367
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,300
Yes, i have, and it's
only a matter of time

368
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,800
Before your father
hears about it as well.

369
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,300
Not from me. I won't tell hi
i wouldn't want to see his face.

370
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,200
Nick, all simon and i do
is talk, okay?

371
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,900
We talk about different ways to
make the world a better place.

372
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,900
You could join us sometime on
one of our talks. Might be fun.

373
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,900
Thank you, no.

374
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,200
Your loss.
Promise me something?
What?

375
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,400
Don't tell daddy.
I promise, i won't.

376
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,400
Okay.

377
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,800
You gonna "nutcracker"
with the fam tonight?
Yeah, i am.

378
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,200
You?

379
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,700
No. No. I, uh,
i'm kinda over it.

380
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,300
But you kids have fun.

381
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,900
Bye.

382
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,300
(Patrick) it's all right.

383
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
It's okay. (Chuckles)

384
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,400
I'm here, baby.

385
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,100
Everything's gonna be
justine.

386
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,500
It's not, though.

387
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,900
When i got home last night,

388
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,200
I could tell little things
had been moved.

389
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,000
Those drawers were open.

390
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,400
That light was on.
I know i turned it off.

391
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,300
What are you looking for?

392
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,300
Bugs.

393
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,600
Bugs?

394
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,300
Surveillance devices.

395
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,300
Detective darling.

396
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,600
Well, i want you
to be safe, right?

397
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
You do believe me,
don't you, paddy?

398
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,200
I believe you.
Of course i do.

399
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
In fact, i'm gonna put somebody
right outside that door, 24/7.

400
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,500
The police?

401
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,200
Unfortunately, i can't
involve the police with this

402
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Because i'm
the attorney general,

403
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,600
And you're not my wife.

404
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,800
But don't worry. I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

405
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,700
Trust me?

406
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,200
Hmm?

407
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,100
(Tripp) so you have
some doubts out god.

408
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,900
You think that means
you have to vacate your post?

409
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,700
I mean, there are
lots of beneficial values

410
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,800
Transmitted by religion.

411
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,100
I guess i just thought
that it would be

412
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,200
A good time
to become authentic.

413
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,000
Did you ever believe?

414
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,500
Really?

415
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,900
I don't know.

416
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,600
The idea of it
always interested me.

417
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,700
The idea?

418
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
The idea
that there's something

419
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,300
That gives its life up

420
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,300
To make room for more life.

421
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,100
That i find fascinating.

422
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,300
No, don't. No, seriously.

423
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,500
I've always envied you...

424
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,700
Your... life of the mind.

425
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah.

426
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,700
I mean, me,
i'm--I've been stuck

427
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,700
Fumbling with the nuts and bolts
of big business.

428
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,900
I mean, i've seen myself referred to
as an "empire builder."

429
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,100
That's not me.

430
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,500
That was my grandfather.

431
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,500
Me, i'm an empire maintainer.

432
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Do you really
want to leave behind

433
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,700
The world of ideas?

434
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,800
What could be better?

435
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,300
I don't know.

436
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,700
I really don't know
what to do.

437
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
I can't tell you what to do.

438
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,500
That--That's for you
to decide.

439
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,800
Sorry. Not gonna happen.

440
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,900
He's not coming?

441
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,600
Robert said he's really
interested in helping you out,

442
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,900
But he started painting
this morning,

443
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,900
He's on a roll and he doesn't want
to stop working on it,

444
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,800
- So he's--He's really sorry.
- Is that really what he said?

445
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,800
No.

446
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,100
He said
he feels like a whore.

447
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,300
So what am i gonna do?

448
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,100
If sofia finds out
i'm not an artist,

449
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,300
She'll just think i'm poor
for no good reason, and then...

450
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,900
Wait a minute. Look at you.

451
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,000
What?

452
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,100
You're not so different
from her--Your height,

453
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,900
Your hips, your...

454
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,800
- Clothes.
- What's your point, jeremy?

455
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,000
Let me just draw you.
It could be practice.

456
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,100
If it turns out any good,
i could use it for sofia.

457
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,400
It's kind of a great idea.

458
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,800
It's kind of not.
You can't draw,

459
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,600
And i can't just sit here
and have you look at me.

460
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
I wouldn't want you sitting.
I want you...

461
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
Standing,

462
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,800
Right where you are.

463
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,200
I'm very uncomfortable with this.

464
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,100
I have just the thing that could make you
feel much less uncomfortable.

465
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,800
How about a little smoky?

466
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:09,900
No.

467
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,200
This is my workplace.

468
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,300
Which is closed,

469
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,600
And we need to chillax--

470
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,700
Me to draw,

471
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,900
You to pose.

472
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,900
You're bad.

473
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,500
And this is a bad idea.

474
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,600
I know.

475
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,200
Hey.

476
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,100
Hi.

477
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,700
This is who you wanted me
to meet?

478
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Karen darling,

479
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,200
I'd like you to meet
princess ama, from ghana.

480
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,700
Pleasure.

481
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,700
Hello.

482
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,300
Okay. Well...

483
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,000
She's my ex-Wife.

484
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,300
We met in the middle of the ocean.

485
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,200
How'd you guys
wrangle that?

486
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,500
My father and i took a trip
to jeffreys bay in south africa

487
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,600
To scatter my mother's ashes.

488
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,800
But after we had scattered
her ashes,

489
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,700
I could not sleep.

490
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,500
I walked out
past the hotel pool,

491
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,300
Onto the beach
and into the ocean.

492
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,100
I swam and swam, weeping.

493
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,900
I missed her so much.

494
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,110
？？

495
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,700
It lit the sky.

496
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,800
And just when i realized
i had gone so far,

497
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I probably
could not get back...

498
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,000
- Donk!
- Oh!

499
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,300
What happened?

500
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,500
I hit my head on the side
of a little boat.

501
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,800
And he was in it.

502
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,600
He helped me into the boat,

503
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,000
And we have been together
ever since.

504
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,200
Uh...

505
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,400
You, um...

506
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,400
You guys aren't
still married, right?

507
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,300
No, no, no, no.

508
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,400
We're divorced.

509
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,700
Yes, marriage for us was a-A way of keeping
our distance.

510
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,000
Not good.

511
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,900
No...

512
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,800
What?

513
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
What did she say?

514
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,400
She approves.

515
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,900
Oh.

516
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,500
Lucky me.

517
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Just doing my job, ma'am.

518
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,200
I know patrick and mr. Darling
are on the outs,

519
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,900
But when he called and asked me
to look in on you,

520
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,000
Well, what can i say?

521
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,100
Your family,
as much as i am, anyway.

522
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,300
Thanks for heating that up
for me.

523
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,700
I'm just sorry i don't
have anything to feed you.

524
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,100
I haven't been able to get out.

525
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,900
I could make you some cookies.

526
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,600
Oh, that's sweet, ma'am,
but sugar and stakeouts,

527
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,000
That's where those cops
go wrong.

528
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,600
Steamed rice
and hard-Boiled eggs--

529
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,700
It's good for the brain,
keeps me sharp.

530
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,700
- I can actually see in the dark.
- You've done this kind
of thing before?

531
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,500
Because this is the first time
i've ever...

532
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,400
I've never played
the damsel in distress.

533
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,200
I've been with the family
for 17 years, ma'am.

534
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
I've seen plenty,

535
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,200
And we've
gotten through all of it.

536
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
So...

537
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Don't worry.

538
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,500
Also, i put a plant
in the plant.

539
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,000
A plant in the plant?

540
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,900
A camera.

541
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,000
There's a live feed
right into my car.

542
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,800
I'm just a few yards away,
so relax

543
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,200
Thank you, clark.

544
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Sleep tight, ma'am.

545
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,100
You know what's funny?

546
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,700
If you told me six months ago

547
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,100
That i, jeremy darling,

548
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,900
Would be working
in a parking garage

549
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,200
And would be pretending
to be a painter,

550
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,500
I would not believe you.

551
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,700
Life is full of surprises,
isn't it?

552
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,600
- It is.
- Mm-Hmm.

553
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,800
I'm a sucky artist.

554
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:57,800
Aww.

555
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,000
I am.

556
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,600
Look.
But...

557
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,400
You know,
i'm getting better.

558
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,800
I'm quite surprised.

559
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,600
- Oh!
- Ah!

560
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,400
- That's my point. That is my point.
- Yeah.

561
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,300
You know what?

562
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,800
You should try
being yourlf with sofia.

563
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
You need to be honest,

564
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,700
And letting things
unfold naturally, organically.

565
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,500
You think so?

566
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,600
I do.

567
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,800
Lying will slowly kill
your insides, jeremy.

568
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,700
Once she sees who you are--

569
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,600
Who you are--

570
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,300
She'll be able to love you
for what you are.

571
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,300
Tell her the truth.

572
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,300
It may surprise you.

573
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,000
And it might just
disappoint everybody supremely.

574
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,300
What's the matter?

575
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
What just happened?

576
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,600
I'm losing my husband.

577
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,100
What, to karen?

578
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,200
Give me a break.

579
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
To all of you.

580
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,000
You're stoned.

581
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
No, no.

582
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,200
Ever since he took this job,
he's just been slipping away.

583
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,700
He's never around, you know?

584
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,700
He comes home late,he leaves early,

585
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,900
He's always so busy.

586
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,500
And kiki and i are just...

587
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,800
There, you know?

588
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,900
We--We...

589
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,000
We feel like
we have to compete.

590
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,900
We're...

591
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,400
We' there.

592
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,500
We're...

593
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,900
We're there.
We're...

594
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,100
We're there missing him

595
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,900
And loving him,

596
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,000
And he's off doing
god knows what for all of you. And...

597
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,100
He doesn't have to.

598
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,200
We had a good life before he took this job.

599
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,300
He doesn't need to do this.
He doesn't.

600
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,300
I don't get it. I don't.

601
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,700
And i'm sorry,
because i'm stoned.

602
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,100
I'm being stupid.
I'm rambling. I'm sorry.

603
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,100
I don't get it either.

604
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,100
If you were mine...

605
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,800
I'd be a couch potato.

606
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,800
Jeremy?

607
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,900
Hmm?

608
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,700
You're sitting on my lap.

609
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
I know.

610
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It feels nice.

611
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,300
Jeremy...

612
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,500
Don't do that again, okay?

613
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,300
Okay.

614
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,200
Damn it.

615
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,900
God.

616
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,400
Clark?

617
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,700
Clark,

618
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,200
Is that you?

619
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,100
Hey, dad, where's mom?

620
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,100
She couldn't make it.
She got hung up at the gallery.

621
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,800
Too bad for her.

622
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,000
This is like a once-In-A-Lifetime
experience here.

623
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,700
Not really.
They do it every year.

624
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,400
Wow.

625
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,200
Really?

626
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Yep.

627
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,300
I have to marry
into this family.

628
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,300
Well, kiki, i'm not sure
that's the right attitude to be cultivating.

629
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,200
You don't hate ballets,
do you?

630
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,200
This isn't gonna
drive you away?

631
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,000
No, no.
This is interesting.

632
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,300
We definitely don't have
anything like this

633
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,200
Where i come from.

634
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,600
Good. I can't wait
to see you see it.

635
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Hey.
What are you doing here?

636
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,900
Nothing.

637
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,200
Sit down.

638
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,200
Karen, you okay?

639
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,100
I'm fine.

640
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,300
Something happen
between you and simon?

641
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,700
I don't want to talk about it.

642
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,000
- Karen, you can tell me.
- Nothing happened.

643
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:21,900
All right.

644
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,200
That has to be
the prettiest dress on earth.

645
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,900
Thank you.

646
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,700
Good evening, everybody.

647
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,700
Shall we start the show?

648
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,400
Mrs. Gla, you here to see
your big blue sponge?

649
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,200
I am.

650
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,300
It's really big.

651
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,700
May i touch it?

652
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,700
Of course.
It's yours, most.

653
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,200
Oh, my god.

654
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,300
It reeks.

655
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,400
Oh, no, no. That's the thai food
we had last night.

656
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,100
We?

657
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,300
- Me. A wee bit of thai food.
- Sorry.

658
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,700
It's marijuana.

659
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,400
I would know
that smell anywhere.

660
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,600
I had a stoner husband
for four years,

661
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,200
And this is what everything
smelled like, all the time.

662
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,400
This and patchouli.

663
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,700
God, it...

664
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
It is.
It's pot, isn't it?

665
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,100
I'm sure if someone did
smoke pot near the sponge,

666
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,000
The smell wouldn't be
absorbed permanently, ma'am.

667
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,200
It's a sponge.

668
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,900
Absorbing is
what they do.

669
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,700
- Um, alex, please, wait.
- Mrs. Glass, i'm sure there's
something we can do.

670
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,900
I don't want that thing.

671
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,400
It smells
and it reminds me of hugh.

672
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,200
W--

673
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,700
Well, you just killed
a $150,000 sale.

674
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,900
I'm sorry.

675
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,900
No, you're not.
You're fired.

676
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
You sleep okay?

677
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,700
Mm, in and out.

678
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,000
Had espresso
at 10:00 last night.

679
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,800
Made my brain
a little jumpy.

680
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Silly thing to do.

681
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,700
Are you okay?

682
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,200
Are you settling in to us?

683
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,000
Oh, sure i am. Yeah.

684
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,100
I am grateful
for all of this,

685
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,500
All of you that you're
still willing to give me.

686
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,900
- It's clarky.
- Mm.

687
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,000
He's calling.

688
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,200
Uh, hey, clarky,
what's cooking?

689
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,000
Sir,

690
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,300
You need to come over here.

691
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,100
Uh, what's the matter?

692
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,900
It's carmelita, sir.

693
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,900
I don't know how it happened,
but...

694
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,500
She's gone.

695
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,700
Okay. Well, um,

696
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,400
Thanks for calling, clark.

697
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,400
I'll get right on it.

698
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,300
Right.

699
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,300
It's fingernail polish, sir.

700
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,800
It seems he or she came in
through the bathroom window,

701
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,100
Went straight into
the bedroom

702
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,600
And waited there
to seize carmelita.

703
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,900
They managed to elude
the ficus.

704
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,500
Clarky...

705
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,200
How could this happen?

706
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,400
I'm sorry, sir. I...

707
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,400
I am.

708
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Me, too.

709
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
She's gone.

710
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,800
Well, look at you.

711
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,400
What a beautiful suit.

712
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,800
Yeah, it was in my closet.

713
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,300
How's it feel?

714
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,000
Like a uniform.

715
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,500
Well, i'll give you
some suspenders.

716
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,900
It'll take the edge off.

717
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,300
So...

718
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,100
Speak.

719
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,500
Well, last night
i did some thinking.

720
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,300
And?

721
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,000
I wasn't able to come
to any conclusion.

722
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
Every time i imagined
leaving the church,

723
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,200
I got so anxious,
i realized i had to go back.

724
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,600
And every time
i imagined staying,

725
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,200
I...

726
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,600
Felt so trapped,
i realized i had to leave.

727
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,700
Well, that sounds like
a hard way to spend an evening.

728
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,700
It's a hard way
to spend a life.

729
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah, but that's over now,
right?

730
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,300
Yeah.

731
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,900
And after i thought about it
for a long time,

732
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,300
I stopped thinking,

733
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,100
And i prayed.

734
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,300
And did you get
your answer?

735
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,500
Yeah, i did.

736
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,000
From god?

737
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,900
I think so.

738
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,800
What did...

739
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,000
"He-She" have to say?

740
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,200
I'd like
to come work for you.

741
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,200
I think it's best for me

742
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,300
And for darling enterprises.

743
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,800
This is god talking, right,

744
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,100
Not your mother?

745
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,800
She doesn't even know
i'm here.

746
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,900
Well..

747
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,400
Far be it from me
to ignore the...

748
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,400
Still small voice
of the lord.

749
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,100
Welcome to the company, son.

750
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,200
Thank you.

751
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,300
Nick.

752
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,700
Did we have a meeting?

753
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,800
I just need a minute.

754
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,800
It's okay.

755
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,800
What's going on?
You seem like something--

756
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,900
I don't know what happened
between you and karen last night.

757
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,000
And i don't want to know,

758
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,300
But i am telling you to stay away from her.

759
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,200
Why?

760
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,800
- I mean, i knew she was upset about--
- I said i don't want to know.

761
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,900
There is a city full of women,
a world full of women,

762
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,200
Out there for you, son--
Why her?

763
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,400
You can have
any woman you want.

764
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,900
Now if you care about our
business relationship at all,

765
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,100
If you've been sincere with me about
your intentis, your vision for the city,

766
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,500
And if you're not just in this
to destroy the darlings,

767
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,000
- Let her go.
- Did tripp send you to say this?

768
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,900
No.

769
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,400
This is between you and me

770
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,800
You are a married man.

771
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,600
Simon, that is not
what this is about.

772
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,900
Let her go.

773
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,800
All right.
I'll let her go.

774
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,000
Thank you.

775
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,000
Five years--

776
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,300
Financial statements.

777
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,700
This is incredible.

778
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,800
No, it's not.

779
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
It's business.

780
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,700
Well, it kind of
look like me...

781
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,300
Mm, maybe if i--
If i squint.

782
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,600
Okay, all right, sofia,

783
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,100
I-I need to tell you something
right now,

784
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,200
Because i...

785
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,400
I don't--I don't want my insides
to die any more than they already have.

786
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,400
What, you're--You're sick?

787
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,300
Oh, no, no, no. I'm--I'm sick--
I'm sick of lying.

788
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,800
'Cause, sofia, i am--
I am--I am not a painter.

789
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,400
I didn't--I didn't paint
any of these.

790
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,000
I mean, i did do this sketch,
which is why it...

791
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,300
Really sucks, but...

792
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,500
What are you talking about?

793
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,800
I lied to you...

794
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,600
About everything.

795
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,000
I--All these paintings
and, um...

796
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,900
By pretending that--

797
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,800
That they were mine so that you'd think
i was a-A poor artist

798
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,900
And not some rich, lazy ass,
which is actually what i am.

799
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,000
Because, sofia, my last name
isn't babeson.

800
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,900
It's darling.

801
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,000
My family
is worth $35 billion.

802
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,600
Am i supposed to
believe this?

803
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,900
I know. It's crazy.

804
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,900
But you see, i wanted to
make sure that you liked me

805
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,600
Before you knew the truth

806
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,200
Because i have suffered too much
at the hands of these love pirates.

807
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,900
Sofia, now that you know
who i am,

808
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,700
You can love me for what i am, right?

809
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,800
I trusted you, you...

810
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,200
I know, i know.
I'm so sorry.

811
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,400
No, i'm sorry.

812
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,800
You think because you
tell me the truth,

813
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,000
It's gonna be okay?

814
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,900
That's not the way
to treat people.

815
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,700
I don't care who you are,

816
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,200
How much money you have.

817
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,100
Bye, jeremy babeson
or...

818
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Whatever.

819
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,600
I have something
to tell you.

820
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,500
Last night, i was sitting
with you and your family,

821
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,700
And i realized something.

822
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,900
I want to stay here.

823
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
You are staying here.

824
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,500
No, i mean indefinitely.

825
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,800
What about your uncle?

826
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,000
Oh, i e-Mail him last night.
It's okay. He's cool.

827
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,100
He has, like,
nine other nephews.

828
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,900
Oh, this is
the best day ever!

829
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,700
Okay, well, we have to
go shopping

830
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,100
Before we do anything else.

831
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,700
- For what?
- Warm clothes. It's cold outside,

832
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,500
And you're not
totally acclimated yet.

833
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,900
- Juliet.
- What?

834
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,700
I didn't come here
from the seychelles

835
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,600
For you to take care of me
like some kind of poodle, okay?

836
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,200
I know.

837
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
I came because...

838
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,300
I came for you. Okay?

839
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,200
Kai.

840
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,300
Yes.

841
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,000
Can i give you one gift?

842
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,700
No. I just said no gifts.

843
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,800
I want...

844
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,300
I want you
to be my first.

845
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,400
Your first?

846
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,100
You know...

847
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,800
My first.

848
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,000
Tonight?

849
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,600
Whenever.

850
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,300
But i want it to be you.

851
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,300
Juliet.

852
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,300
Hmm?

853
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,500
You're amazing.

854
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,300
I'll take one of those.

855
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,400
Hey.

856
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,600
You okay?

857
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,200
Yeah. I'm all right.

858
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,000
I got fired today.

859
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,400
What?

860
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,500
Yeah.

861
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,500
Cheers.

862
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,700
Uh, cheers.

863
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,600
Well, you want to tell me
what happened?

864
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,800
I was stupid.

865
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,300
When jeremy came
to the gallery yesterday,

866
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,100
He smoked pot,

867
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,700
And the smoke permeated
this giant blue german sponge,

868
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,000
And this lady
was gonna buy it,

869
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,700
And she freaked out
and changed her mind.

870
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,100
Oops.

871
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,200
Okay.

872
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,100
And did you do it, too,
get high?

873
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:58,900
Yeah.

874
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,700
I did.

875
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,500
I see.

876
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,400
Maybe i wanted
something bad to happen

877
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,700
To just...
shake things up.

878
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,800
Well, inviting the darlings
into any situation

879
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,900
Is definitely--

880
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,300
Increases the chances
of things getting shaken up.

881
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Now you know how i feel.

882
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,800
Do i?

883
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,800
Yeah.

884
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,100
Yeah, you do.

885
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,100
I'm sorry i'm unemployed.

886
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,000
It's okay.
We got plenty of money.

887
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,700
You want to have

Okay.

Yeah.

900
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,300
We're not in over our heads
with this thing, are we?

901
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,300

What--You don't--
Don't worry about that.

906
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,300
You promise me you're not
getting emotionally involved.

907
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,900
I'm not.

908
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,300
I promise.

909
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,400
Because you told me
that was absolutely not part of the plan.

910
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,300
I know.

911
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:45,100
