1
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:21,362
Have you dispatched
Suffolk to the north?

2
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:24,387
- Yes, your majesty.
- What did you say to him?

3
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:27,156
I urged him as a true knight
to his sovereign lord

4
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:29,381
Not to spare but frankly to slay

5
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:31,648
Plenty of these false rebels.

6
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,157
I said to him there was
no need for courtesy

7
00:01:34,282 --> 00:01:36,982
- In shedding the blood of traitors.
- And?

8
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:41,264
The emperor will shortly
be dispatching an envoy

9
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:43,175
With authority to discuss
with Your Majesty

10
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,150
possible candidates
for the hand of Lady Mary.

11
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,652
What do you think of this?

12
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:55,375
It's the Bucintoro, the doge's ship.

13
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,076
When it is built,

14
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,558
the queen will ride in it
to her coronation.

15
00:02:00,196 --> 00:02:03,350
Then it will indeed
be a memorable occasion.

16
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:07,929
Of course, it will have to wait
until after the birth of my son.

17
00:02:08,054 --> 00:02:09,154
What's that?

18
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,506
This is a pamphlet,
widely distributed.

19
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:14,591
Its author is Reginald Pole,

20
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,133
of Your Majesty's acquaintance,

21
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,712
Who has lately been made a
cardinal by the bishop of Rome.

22
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:22,251
A cardinal?

23
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,286
What does it say?

24
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,648
It condemns Your Majesty
in the vilest terms.

25
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:31,608
As what?

26
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,750
As a heretic, and...

27
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:38,516
as an adulterer.

28
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:45,037
So much for gratitude...

29
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:49,928
Unfortunately, there is more.

30
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:53,141
My creatures tell me that
the same cardinal Pole

31
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:56,258
Is now in France, as papal
legate and has been granted

32
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:58,786
private audience with king Francis.

33
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:02,264
Apparently, he is trying to
persuade the french, and others,

34
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:06,070
to help rekindle the rebellions
against Your Majesty.

35
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:17,999
Every year, the doge of Venice
travels out in this ship,

36
00:03:18,124 --> 00:03:21,524
into the lagoon, to renew his
marriage vows with the sea.

37
00:03:21,976 --> 00:03:23,676
Marriage with the sea...

38
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:28,823
What prince does not aspire to have
such an elemental mistress?

39
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:46,433
Mr. Aske.

40
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:50,145
You have been accused of
conspiring to deprive the King

41
00:03:50,457 --> 00:03:52,757
of his title of head of the church,

42
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,916
of seeking to compel him
to hold a parliament,

43
00:03:57,097 --> 00:03:59,917
and finally, of levying war
against him.

44
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,091
All after His Majesty's
gracious pardon was granted.

45
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,122
On all these counts,
we find you guilty as charged.

46
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:12,191
You are to be returned to York,

47
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:15,035
where you enjoyed your
most frantic triumph.

48
00:04:16,082 --> 00:04:19,383
And there hanged in chains
as a punishment

49
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,751
for your grievous sins against
His Majesty's highness

50
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:24,807
and against this realm.

51
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,569
Your horse is ready, Your Grace.

52
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:44,949
Father?

53
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,463
Son.

54
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:49,831
<i>I know you will do your duty.</i>

55
00:04:51,644 --> 00:04:52,644
Thank you.

56
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:55,584
Now, go check on the horses.

57
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:09,468
I don't ask for your
blessing, Catherine.

58
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:13,369
Please don't send me
away with your curse.

59
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:16,444
You are a man of honor,

60
00:05:17,928 --> 00:05:20,527
and I pray to God, I shall
never have cause to curse

61
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:22,563
Or disoblige you.

62
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:27,728
But I beg you, show mercy.

63
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:30,706
Especially to the innocent.

64
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:47,448
Sir Ralph Ellerker.

65
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:50,817
Sir Ralph...

66
00:05:52,114 --> 00:05:54,728
You are accused of taking part
in the late insurrection

67
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,592
<i>That so wretchedly offended
his King's majesty</i>

68
00:05:57,717 --> 00:05:59,217
<i>and the whole realm.</i>

69
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:02,931
<i>We have taken account of
your deposition to the court:</i>

70
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:05,600
<i>that you only joined the rebels
out of fear for your own life</i>

71
00:06:05,725 --> 00:06:07,925
and the lives of your dependants.

72
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,229
<i>We also note your subsequent
vows of contrition.</i>

73
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:15,081
- We ask you to sign this.
- What is it?

74
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:17,005
An oath.

75
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,053
<i>You swear
that you are heartily sorry</i>

76
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:23,965
<i>That you have offended
the King's highness in this rebellion.</i>

77
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:27,355
You promise never again
to make unlawful assembly

78
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,470
and also promise to inform
against anyone else who does.

79
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,352
<i>From henceforth, you shall be a true</i>

80
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:36,981
<i>and faithful subject unto our king,</i>

81
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:39,217
<i>our sovereign lord Henry the eighth,</i>

82
00:06:39,342 --> 00:06:41,503
King of England and
of France and on earth

83
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:44,903
Supreme head of the church of England,
so help you God.

84
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:48,886
<i>And in return, His Majesty
will grant you mercy.</i>

85
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:32,986
- That one's moving!
- Finish him.

86
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:47,152
- Make way!
- You there!

87
00:07:47,277 --> 00:07:48,662
Stop what you're doing!

88
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:51,338
Stop your labors, do you hear?

89
00:07:51,835 --> 00:07:53,261
- ... Of the King! Make way!

90
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:54,794
-Cease your labors!

91
00:07:55,018 --> 00:07:56,349
You stop it, you!

92
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:00,448
You are traitorous villains.
All of you.

93
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:03,441
You were bound,
by law and by nature,

94
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:05,607
to obey the King's Majesty.

95
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:08,069
And yet you followed
the traitor Aske...

96
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,988
- You're the traitors!
- And rose in rebellion against him!

97
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,167
And you...

98
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:20,831
It is my purpose here

99
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:23,972
to show a fearful example
to those who would disobey

100
00:08:24,097 --> 00:08:27,961
His most gracious and sacred
Majesty, who after all,

101
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:30,928
in his mercy, granted you a pardon.

102
00:08:32,622 --> 00:08:35,863
Whereupon you continued
your willful disobedience

103
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,907
and traitorous hearts.
For these reasons,

104
00:08:39,238 --> 00:08:41,238
The King will not forgive you.

105
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:43,444
And neither will God!

106
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,040
Your Majesty...

107
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:17,201
Ladies...

108
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:42,457
Our father, who art in heaven

109
00:09:43,658 --> 00:09:45,208
hallowed be thy name,

110
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:48,487
thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

111
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:52,211
on earth as it is in heaven.

112
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:06,815
Please, lord,

113
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:09,376
forgive thy poor servant,

114
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:11,709
his trespasses against your flock.

115
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:27,104
Mr. Aske, my name is Richard Curwen.

116
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,616
I am an ordained priest,

117
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:31,878
and I have come to
hear your confession.

118
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:36,508
May I speak to you
honestly, Mr. Curwen?

119
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,431
Please, do not betray my trust.

120
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:46,621
Never, Mr. Aske.

121
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:14,391
Tomorrow,

122
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:17,356
I must beg the forgiveness

123
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:19,539
Not only of his Sacred Majesty,

124
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:22,572
But also of Cromwell
and the other heretics.

125
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:27,261
It sticks in my craw...

126
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:32,050
<i>Cromwell has openly said</i>

127
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,683
That all us northerners
were traitors...

128
00:11:36,806 --> 00:11:38,782
It offended me so much.

129
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:42,783
<i>And then, several times,
he offered me a pardon,</i>

130
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:45,258
For confessing the truth!

131
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:51,291
Cromwell is the devil's
messenger, Mr. Curwen.

132
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:53,725
And yet, I must beg his pardon.

133
00:11:57,772 --> 00:11:59,972
Or else they will hurt my family,

134
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:02,918
And that I cannot allow.

135
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:05,894
Bad enough that my wife and children

136
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:09,958
will see me hanged,
and left to rot in these chains.

137
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:13,012
Mr. Aske,

138
00:12:13,726 --> 00:12:15,576
is there anything you need?

139
00:12:16,513 --> 00:12:18,973
Anything I can get you, for solace?

140
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:26,853
There can be no solace, Mr. Curwen.

141
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:31,369
I will sit here awhile, and weep,

142
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:36,692
And thereafter deliver myself

143
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:38,199
Into god's hands

144
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:41,258
and into his loving mercy.

145
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:48,536
<i>In nomine patris, et filii, e</i>

146
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,309
<i>Et spiritus sancti.
- Amen.</i>

147
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:55,578
Wait.

148
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:57,733
There is something.

149
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:00,884
Sewn into my collar there.

150
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:17,008
I was given that by the Lady Mary.

151
00:13:19,123 --> 00:13:21,953
As you love our cause, Mr. Curwen,

152
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,578
Please hand it to my wife.
It will ease her burden greatly.

153
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:31,325
- Her majesty the Queen!

154
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:47,801
Sir Francis Bryan.

155
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:55,076
- Majesty.
- Sir Francis.

156
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:08,071
Reginald Pole has shown us
his true heart.

157
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,953
I want you to go to Paris,  protest to
the french king, on our behalf,

158
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:16,317
for the solemn
and pompous reception granted him.

159
00:15:16,826 --> 00:15:17,826
Majesty.

160
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,875
Ask him to deliver the traitor
into your hands,

161
00:15:22,405 --> 00:15:24,105
or face the consequences

162
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:25,921
and our perpetual enmity.

163
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:29,800
What if the king refuses?

164
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,255
Were you not a spy once,
Sir Francis?

165
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:39,113
I was, Your Majesty. Indeed.

166
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:42,814
And a breaker of codes.

167
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:46,256
Well, perhaps you could revisit
some of your old skills.

168
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:49,037
I for one would like
nothing better than to have

169
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,470
Pole trussed up and taken to Calais.

170
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:54,727
And I'd rather alive than dead.

171
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:09,037
Excuse me.

172
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:27,579
What is the lord privy seal doing?

173
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,347
I imagine those nobles
want to buy the leases

174
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:34,202
of some of the suppressed abbeys.

175
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:37,636
What are they giving Mr. Cromwell?

176
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,197
Bribes.

177
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:43,346
Mr. Cromwell is already a rich man.

178
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,959
Some say the richest in the kingdom.

179
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,384
- Does the king know of this practice?
- He asks no questions.

180
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:52,304
As long as the crown
receives its 10 percent share.

181
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,879
Is it not terrible that our sacred
building be used like this for profit?

182
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:00,604
- If you say so.
- Then you have...

183
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:03,346
You have to understand
how clever it is.

184
00:17:04,135 --> 00:17:07,402
By allowing these new men
to buy a stake in the kingdom,

185
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:11,239
Mr. Cromwell makes sure
of their loyalty to the king

186
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:13,543
... and to himself.

187
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,326
- Stop!
- I have to go away.

188
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:48,336
- So?
- So, I can't go until I've had you...

189
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:52,545
This is madness!

190
00:17:52,665 --> 00:17:54,015
I like madness.

191
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:59,011
No. This is too dangerous.

192
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:03,239
My husband might see us.
What if I were to conceive your child?

193
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,628
So what? Lots of women lie
about the fathers of their children.

194
00:18:06,748 --> 00:18:08,505
What does it matter to you?

195
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:11,062
Let Edward raise my brat.

196
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:15,787
Admit it, lady,
this is your game too.

197
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:20,683
Just do it...

198
00:18:43,554 --> 00:18:45,398
- Father.
- Out!

199
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:48,642
- Father!
- Go on, take them out!

200
00:18:54,276 --> 00:18:57,095
Oh, my poor husband!
My poor husband...

201
00:18:57,976 --> 00:18:58,976
Why?

202
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:01,992
Why have they done this to you?

203
00:19:06,586 --> 00:19:07,772
Pray for me.

204
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:14,262
I deserve this.

205
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:18,899
No. No!

206
00:19:19,468 --> 00:19:21,526
You do not deserve this!

207
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,952
Stop it!

208
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,749
You are a good man, Robert Aske!

209
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:08,011
I ask you to pray for me,
for I have greatly offended God,

210
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,431
The king... and the world...

211
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:15,066
God,

212
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:18,636
I have offended by breaking
his commandments in many ways;

213
00:20:20,156 --> 00:20:23,451
and the king I have offended
by breaking his laws,

214
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,303
to which every true subject is
bound by the commandment of God.

215
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:32,126
And the world I offended,

216
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:35,380
since for my actions, so many
have lost their lives,

217
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,450
their lands, and their goods.

218
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:42,131
I ask forgiveness
of his grace, his majesty.

219
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:46,135
Also, my lord privy seal,
my lord chancellor...

220
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:51,501
and my lord of Suffolk,

221
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:55,796
Whose trespasses against me
I also forgive with a free heart.

222
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,293
I love all the world.

223
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:38,840
"This realm goes from good
peace and and quiet, daily,

224
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:41,833
to better and better."

225
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:44,444
"The traitors have been executed:

226
00:21:45,331 --> 00:21:47,672
"the lord Darcy at Tower Hill,

227
00:21:49,422 --> 00:21:53,400
"Aske hanged above the dungeon
of the castle at York."

228
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:58,220
"The rest were executed at Tyburn."

229
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:02,299
So that, as far as we can perceive,

230
00:22:03,141 --> 00:22:05,576
"all the cankered hearts...

231
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:07,531
"have...

232
00:22:08,816 --> 00:22:10,438
"weeded away."

233
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,086
Like this, exactly.

234
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:28,306
<i>Comme ça ?</i>

235
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:33,727
Sir Francis Bryan ?

236
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:35,980
Let me present myself:

237
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:38,097
I am count Talleyrand.

238
00:22:38,217 --> 00:22:40,609
His majesty, king François
has sent me to meet you.

239
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:43,284
Count, allow me to
present my companion:

240
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:46,754
Mr. Thomas Seymour, the brother
of the queen of England.

241
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:48,409
Monsieur.

242
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:52,256
So if the king has sent you, you know
why we have come to France?

243
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:54,613
<i>Oui, oui.</i> I know.

244
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,765
And that we expect your government,
under its treaty obligations, to...

245
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:01,380
apprehend the rebel Reginald Pole,

246
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,632
and deliver him into our custody.

247
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,711
Unfortunately, his majesty
already granted safe passage

248
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:10,723
to this Reginald Pole.

249
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,633
So it would have been dishonorable
for him to hand him over.

250
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:19,603
Nevertheless, he promised
your king by letter, ten days ago,

251
00:23:19,847 --> 00:23:22,193
that he would expel this Pole.

252
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,945
- And so he did.
- Then where is Pole now?

253
00:23:26,664 --> 00:23:30,222
All I know is that he was allowed
to travel to Caserta,

254
00:23:30,818 --> 00:23:32,786
under the emperor's jurisdiction.

255
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,820
It seems to me that your manner
of proceeding has been very strange.

256
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:45,257
I fear it may lose your master
the friendship of mine.

257
00:23:46,864 --> 00:23:48,135
Now, I'm hungry.

258
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,708
Good evening, Count.

259
00:23:52,054 --> 00:23:53,432
Good evening, sir Francis.

260
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,063
<i>Monsieur. Oh...
And bonnes vacances.</i>

261
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,570
Messieurs,
vos repas, s'il vous plaît.

262
00:24:12,914 --> 00:24:14,064
<i>Monsieur...</i>

263
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:17,730
Yes, very pretty.

264
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,850
So,

265
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:22,267
where's Caserta?
Forgive my ignorance.

266
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:25,231
In Italy. North of naples.

267
00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:27,645
It's a nice old town.

268
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:32,221
I tell you this, Tom. If we find Pole,
I will not truss him up...

269
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,100
I'm going to kill him
with my own hands.

270
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,460
Your majesty.

271
00:24:42,644 --> 00:24:45,763
His excellency,
ambassador Eustace Chapuys.

272
00:24:49,172 --> 00:24:50,322
Excellency.

273
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:53,724
Your majesties.

274
00:24:54,252 --> 00:24:56,302
The emperor sends you his love.

275
00:24:56,939 --> 00:24:59,438
And he has charged me
with the grave responsibility

276
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:01,740
of negotiating with your majesty

277
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,294
a suitable marriage for your daughter,
the lady Mary.

278
00:25:05,478 --> 00:25:07,112
Who does the king propose?

279
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:10,785
His highness Don Luis,
the heir to the throne of Portugal

280
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,096
and the brother
of the emperor's wife, Isabella.

281
00:25:14,256 --> 00:25:17,006
What type of man is he,
this Don Luis?

282
00:25:17,635 --> 00:25:20,239
He is in every way a paragon.

283
00:25:21,257 --> 00:25:23,605
A man of great integrity and virtue.

284
00:25:23,882 --> 00:25:26,832
A man who has fought
military campaigns and won.

285
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,444
A man with a profound
knowledge of the world.

286
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,371
My daughter has no knowledge
of the world.

287
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:34,932
She is an ingénue, an innocent.

288
00:25:36,011 --> 00:25:38,261
And she is a very spiritual person.

289
00:25:39,358 --> 00:25:41,498
How will this Don Luis treat her?

290
00:25:43,384 --> 00:25:44,434
Like a nun.

291
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,550
In which case, alas, it may be difficult
for them to produce children.

292
00:25:57,187 --> 00:25:58,237
Excellency.

293
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:13,882
The emperor has suggested
a splendid offer for your hand.

294
00:26:15,293 --> 00:26:18,267
His highness Don Luis
is twenty-four years old,

295
00:26:18,748 --> 00:26:22,043
from a very rich and
distinguished family.

296
00:26:25,597 --> 00:26:26,597
Go on.

297
00:26:27,156 --> 00:26:30,723
I am told he is a great
favorite at the imperial court.

298
00:26:32,981 --> 00:26:34,852
With... Women?

299
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,560
With everyone.

300
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:42,218
Because he is so honorable
and gallant and good natured.

301
00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:45,616
Is he...

302
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,190
good looking?

303
00:26:49,297 --> 00:26:50,297
Yes.

304
00:26:51,385 --> 00:26:53,035
I have seen him myself.

305
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:56,298
He is tall, with very dark hair,

306
00:26:57,193 --> 00:26:58,843
but piercing blue eyes.

307
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:05,332
I am sure that your mother,
god rest her soul,

308
00:27:05,517 --> 00:27:07,017
would have approved.

309
00:27:12,342 --> 00:27:15,050
And everyone at court
is talking about you.

310
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:18,194
They say the queen
has persuaded his majesty

311
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:20,564
to reinstate you to the succession.

312
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:30,029
Poor Robert Aske...

313
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,152
I was told his body
is still hanging,

314
00:27:34,526 --> 00:27:36,726
trimmed in chains, for all to see.

315
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:41,076
I should not be thinking
of my own happiness.

316
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:45,204
Sweet madam, you have
every right to think of it.

317
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,367
Your graces,

318
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:53,645
as head of the church,
I am vexed by your inability

319
00:27:53,765 --> 00:27:57,175
to agree on the fundamental
issues of doctrine and practice.

320
00:27:57,907 --> 00:27:59,657
I listen to your sermons.

321
00:28:00,455 --> 00:28:02,643
And sometimes,
I find them full of...

322
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:06,154
evangelical excesses
which have never been agreed upon

323
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:09,261
and have no place
in the church of England.

324
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:13,909
Your graces, I want unity

325
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:16,478
and agreement in our church.

326
00:28:16,788 --> 00:28:19,856
I want diversity of opinion ended,

327
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,514
and uniformity imposed.

328
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,646
Therefore, I command you
to establish a commission

329
00:28:27,766 --> 00:28:29,124
amongst yourselves,

330
00:28:29,532 --> 00:28:32,686
to determine the basic articles
of our faith.

331
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:36,504
It's her majesty!

332
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:44,147
- What is it?
- Your majesty.

333
00:28:44,877 --> 00:28:47,019
Sweetheart, what is it?

334
00:28:47,557 --> 00:28:49,257
Everything is all right.

335
00:28:49,846 --> 00:28:50,846
Come.

336
00:28:57,762 --> 00:28:59,062
Can you feel it?

337
00:29:01,295 --> 00:29:02,395
It's moving!

338
00:29:04,027 --> 00:29:05,177
It's kicking!

339
00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:08,765
I can feel it.

340
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:10,803
He feels strong!

341
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:19,229
Edward,

342
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:21,503
my son...

343
00:29:24,043 --> 00:29:25,071
Be strong.

344
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,095
A crown I catch the next one.

345
00:29:57,937 --> 00:29:59,402
What is it, father?

346
00:30:03,228 --> 00:30:04,564
Can't you see him?

347
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,140
See who?

348
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:08,052
Over there...

349
00:30:09,695 --> 00:30:11,032
Can't you see him?

350
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,451
Well, look!

351
00:30:21,226 --> 00:30:22,803
Tell me you can see him.

352
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:24,854
That man...

353
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:27,211
He's there!

354
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:33,831
You can see him{\, can't you}?

355
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:38,711
For god's sake, do you see him?

356
00:30:39,825 --> 00:30:40,928
In a while,

357
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:43,489
The queen will come to full term.

358
00:30:43,788 --> 00:30:47,170
I want you to organize the celebrations
for the birth of my son.

359
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,473
- I would be honored.
- I want them to be truly spectacular;

360
00:30:51,073 --> 00:30:53,978
Te deums and bonfires
throughout the kingdom,

361
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,727
And free wine for everyone.
And tournaments.

362
00:30:57,092 --> 00:31:00,545
I had planned a tournament for
prince's birth with my last queen.

363
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,517
It had to be cancelled.

364
00:31:02,637 --> 00:31:05,644
This time your majesty will
have no reason to cancel it.

365
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,695
May I ask your majesty's
opinion on another matter?

366
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,465
In the recent rebellion

367
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:16,214
Which, thank god, your majesty
has now suppressed,

368
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:18,851
And the worst rascals
properly put to death-

369
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:22,880
Great cause was made by some
against the lord privy seal,

370
00:31:23,463 --> 00:31:26,407
Who in some quarters
was blamed for it.

371
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,210
Frankly we thought him in danger,

372
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,042
Whilst trusting he was not.

373
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:44,912
It was the rebels who demanded
mr. Cromwell's head.

374
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:48,484
And by doing so,
they saved it.

375
00:32:01,363 --> 00:32:03,129
- Yes, lady Rochford?
- Majesty.

376
00:32:03,697 --> 00:32:05,530
Lady lisle has written to me asking

377
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,866
If your majesty might find
a place in your household

378
00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:09,499
For one of her two daughters.

379
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:12,822
- I told her I'd mention it to you.
- Have you warned the lady lisle

380
00:32:12,942 --> 00:32:16,016
That life at court is full of pride,
envy, scorn, and derision?

381
00:32:17,384 --> 00:32:20,332
If you have, then send them to me.
And I'll choose one of them.

382
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:23,300
Remember,
They must bring two sets of clothes:

383
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:25,710
One of satin,
the other of damask.

384
00:32:26,102 --> 00:32:26,981
Madam.

385
00:32:29,424 --> 00:32:30,615
Lady Misseldon,

386
00:32:30,922 --> 00:32:32,224
help me unlace my gown.

387
00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:34,522
It seems to grow
tighter by the hour.

388
00:32:39,271 --> 00:32:42,760
If anything should happen to me,
be a comfort to his majesty.

389
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:47,631
Majesty.

390
00:32:49,828 --> 00:32:51,215
- Madam!
- Majesty!

391
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,560
Don't be alarmed, ladies.

392
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,389
But I think my time
has come.

393
00:32:55,722 --> 00:32:57,600
- Lady mary?
- Majesty.

394
00:32:57,951 --> 00:33:00,860
Please swear, that you will stay
with me now and not forsake me.

395
00:33:01,524 --> 00:33:02,605
I do promise.

396
00:33:03,444 --> 00:33:06,025
Then all will be well.
Go fetch the midwife.

397
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:09,667
Come to the bed.

398
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:10,993
Majesty?

399
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:14,516
Well? Is it time?

400
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,138
Yes, your majesty.

401
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:20,753
Send my physician to watch it.

402
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,149
- Yes, your majesty.
- And fetch my Lord Beauchamp.

403
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:24,993
- And Bishop Gardiner.
- Majesty.

404
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,992
Some Heralds into the city
to tell them the news!

405
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:31,733
And Cromwell, tell Mr. Cromwell
Tell him...

406
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:36,037
Tell him that whole
worlds hang in the balance.

407
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,590
It's happening!
It's happening!

408
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,466
I pray jesus, if he wills,
to send us a prince!

409
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:58,747
<i>- Domine adjutor et protector
noster, adjuva nos. Amen.</i>

410
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:08,487
- Lady Mary.
- Yes, Madam.

411
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:10,116
The box.

412
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,945
It used to belong to your mother.

413
00:34:35,248 --> 00:34:36,997
I think she's here, with us.

414
00:34:40,202 --> 00:34:42,600
I believe with all my heart
she will help you.

415
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:54,112
Almighty and everlasting god,

416
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:58,109
Mercifully look upon
our infirmities,

417
00:34:59,451 --> 00:35:01,739
And in all our dangers
and necessities,

418
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:04,614
Stretch forth thy right hand

419
00:35:05,709 --> 00:35:07,860
To help us and defend us.

420
00:35:09,467 --> 00:35:11,067
Through christ our lord.

421
00:35:14,074 --> 00:35:16,293
You've got to push.
All four fingers.

422
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:22,995
Good, your majesty.

423
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:32,604
Tomorrow there will
be a solemn procession

424
00:35:32,724 --> 00:35:33,985
Through the city,

425
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:37,740
All to pray for the queen if she
is still in labor with child.

426
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:42,923
If she's still in labor
with child, god help us...

427
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:47,730
I think to lose them both.

428
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:28,322
I am reconciled with god.

429
00:36:30,161 --> 00:36:32,470
I've done nothing against
my conscience.

430
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:40,778
To serve the king is to serve god.

431
00:36:45,845 --> 00:36:47,087
I'm with child.

432
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:08,298
She's no better.

433
00:37:28,684 --> 00:37:30,198
Please,{\ my lady.}
Don't give up.

434
00:37:30,521 --> 00:37:33,096
Please, for the love of Jesus,
don't give up!

435
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:41,205
- Your majesty, I talked
to the physicians.

436
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:44,502
In their opinion there is not
a great deal of time left.

437
00:37:45,572 --> 00:37:47,455
The baby is likely to die

438
00:37:47,575 --> 00:37:50,524
Unless they cut open the
queen's belly to release it.

439
00:37:53,477 --> 00:37:56,519
It is uncertan
That she herself will die.

440
00:38:00,305 --> 00:38:03,086
Your majesty may thus
have to decide soon

441
00:38:03,812 --> 00:38:06,407
Between the life of the
mother or of the child.

442
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:23,227
<i>Kyrie, Eleison;
Kyrie, Eleison.</i>

443
00:38:23,745 --> 00:38:26,678
<i>Christe, Eleison;
Christe, Eleison.</i>

444
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:52,511
Let me pass!

445
00:39:02,724 --> 00:39:03,798
Your majesty.

446
00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:19,547
Her majesty is delivered...

447
00:39:20,412 --> 00:39:21,808
Of a healthy son.

448
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:29,419
I've a son?

449
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:35,980
I've a son!

450
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:38,316
Yes, your majesty.

451
00:39:38,924 --> 00:39:40,012
You've a son.

452
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:04,642
And a future king of England.

453
00:40:31,081 --> 00:40:32,602
Bless you, sweet child.

454
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:54,863
Our son...

455
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,710
Bless you, child,

456
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,493
In the name of god,

457
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:02,958
The virgin Mary,

458
00:41:04,106 --> 00:41:05,306
and St. George.

459
00:41:25,452 --> 00:41:26,861
He's a sweet prince.

460
00:41:27,587 --> 00:41:30,236
- Yes, he is.
- And he's our brother.

461
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:33,072
The king has waited
a long time for a son.

462
00:41:33,522 --> 00:41:35,070
But he still loves us.

463
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,205
A boy is more
important, Elizabeth.

464
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:41,981
I don't think so.

465
00:41:51,268 --> 00:41:53,092
In the name of
the father,

466
00:41:53,713 --> 00:41:54,452
son,

467
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,116
And holy ghost

468
00:41:58,631 --> 00:42:00,445
I baptize thee edward.

469
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,495
May god bless and keep you
all the days of your life,

470
00:42:04,994 --> 00:42:07,506
And give you abundantly his grace,

471
00:42:08,097 --> 00:42:10,981
Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

472
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:12,397
Amen.

473
00:42:14,104 --> 00:42:17,006
God, of his almighty
and infinite grace,

474
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:21,218
Give and grant good life
and long to the right high,

475
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:24,126
Right excellent,
and noble Prince Edward,

476
00:42:24,756 --> 00:42:27,485
Duke of Cornwall
and earl of Chester,

477
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:30,240
Most dear and entirely beloved son

478
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,357
To our most dread and gracious
lord, King Henry the eighth.

479
00:42:38,482 --> 00:42:40,715
The Queen's health
has rapidly deteriorated.

480
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:42,772
Yesterday evening she'd
a loosening of the bowels

481
00:42:42,892 --> 00:42:45,046
we felt sure
we could save her...

482
00:42:45,588 --> 00:42:48,671
But during the night her
fever grew worse again.

483
00:42:49,885 --> 00:42:52,335
We have tried everything we know.

484
00:42:53,396 --> 00:42:56,521
But... Her majesty
continues to weaken.

485
00:43:14,055 --> 00:43:15,436
It's childbed fever.

486
00:43:17,334 --> 00:43:19,441
I know because my mother died of it.

487
00:43:23,863 --> 00:43:24,784
Get out.

488
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:27,763
Leave.

489
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:32,857
Majesty.

490
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,173
Majesty.

491
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:34,447
Don't go.

492
00:44:37,294 --> 00:44:38,254
Please,

493
00:44:38,778 --> 00:44:39,781
don't go.

494
00:44:41,928 --> 00:44:45,374
Just because you have done
everything that you promised,

495
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:47,676
Please don't leave me.

496
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:55,281
You are the milk of human kindness

497
00:44:57,187 --> 00:44:59,786
And the light in my
dark, dark world.

498
00:45:05,374 --> 00:45:07,311
Without you life is a desert.

499
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,789
A howling wilderness.

500
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:21,336
Please god,

501
00:45:22,802 --> 00:45:24,225
in your mercy,

502
00:45:26,081 --> 00:45:27,843
Don't take her away from me.

503
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:34,582
My son needs his mother...

504
00:45:37,545 --> 00:45:39,159
And I need my queen.
