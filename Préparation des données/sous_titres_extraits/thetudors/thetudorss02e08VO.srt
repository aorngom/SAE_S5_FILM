1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,213
Previously...

2
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:04,778
Will you ask if Francis won't agree to
the marriage of Elizabeth to his son?

3
00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:07,418
It'll be better for us to pursue
an alliance with the Emperor.

4
00:00:07,518 --> 00:00:10,372
- That would suit Katherine.
- Leave the greater things to my care.

5
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:13,508
Anyone can see that he isn't
so much in love with her as he used to.

6
00:00:13,608 --> 00:00:16,048
- What's wrong with her?
- Perhaps she's afraid.

7
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:18,957
So long as they are both alive,
I can't be safe.

8
00:00:19,057 --> 00:00:22,235
- I can just order their deaths!
- You're crazy! Stop it!

9
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:25,321
You're the Queen of England.
Act like it!

10
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:28,950
From now on, we must all be careful
not to lose the King's love,

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,869
or everything is lost.

12
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,106
Sir John, you have an unexpected guest.

13
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:36,207
Your Majesty, may I present my daughter,
Lady Jane Seymour?

14
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:39,461
The hours of my death draws fast on,

15
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:41,837
and I commend unto you
our daughter Mary.

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,927
beseeching you to be a good father.

17
00:00:45,027 --> 00:00:46,718
Now I'm indeed Queen.

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,072
The King of England has been carried
far from the shore,

19
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:53,350
but he does not know it.
He thinks he can swim alone.

20
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,565
Very soon, he will realize

21
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:58,456
he is not swimming, but drowning.

22
00:00:58,556 --> 00:01:00,981
Have you told her about me?
Why the hell not?

23
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,861
If you'd read Greek, you would know that
even gods had problems with their wives.

24
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:08,072
You are determined to close
every religious house in England.

25
00:01:08,313 --> 00:01:10,245
You are far too high-handed.

26
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:13,181
You ought to be careful,
or I'll have you cropped at the neck.

27
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:15,115
I did not bring you up to quarrel

28
00:01:15,215 --> 00:01:17,904
- with those closest to the Crown.
- I'm the King's wife.

29
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:20,576
And you should remember
how you got there!

30
00:01:20,676 --> 00:01:24,254
He fell in love with me.
He respected me.

31
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:27,112
Jane should come to court
as Lady to Her Majesty.

32
00:01:27,312 --> 00:01:28,710
Thank you, Your Majesty.

33
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,686
I am carrying

34
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:32,902
the King's son.

35
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:35,800
We are on the edge of a golden world!

36
00:01:55,398 --> 00:01:58,854

Synchro VO: dmbmh

39
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:32,318
Thank you, Edward.

40
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:34,933
Sister.

41
00:03:51,635 --> 00:03:53,630
- Lady Jane?
- Yes.

42
00:03:58,217 --> 00:04:00,076
Her Majesty is just coming.

43
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:04,081
You are not to speak anything to her
until you are invited to.

44
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,831
Yes.

45
00:04:09,212 --> 00:04:11,916
Your Majesty...

46
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:26,260
Mistress Seymour, will you place
your hand upon this Holy Bible...

47
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:30,200
And will you promise and swear
to serve Her Majesty Queen Anne

48
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,566
faithfully, honorably and discreetly.

49
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:36,668
And will you promise and swear
that your conduct will always be modest,

50
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:38,424
virtuous and good,

51
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:41,786
presenting at all times
a godly spectacle to others?

52
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:44,880
I do so promise and swear.

53
00:05:11,192 --> 00:05:12,551
Lady Jane.

54
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:14,692
Your Majesty.

55
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:34,334
The King.

56
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:38,030
Your Majesty...

57
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:48,140
Mr. Secretary.

58
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:57,554
I managed with some difficulty
to obtain a copy

59
00:05:57,654 --> 00:06:00,089
of the secret report
of the autopsy on Katherine.

60
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:03,070
- What was discovered?
- That the internal organs were normal,

61
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,969
except for the heart,
which had a black growth,

62
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:09,143
all hideous to behold,
which clung closely to the outside.

63
00:06:09,892 --> 00:06:11,408
What could have caused it?

64
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,226
Her doctor, who I trust completely,

65
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:17,071
told me that such a growth
was consistent

66
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:19,782
with the evidence of poisoning.

67
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:22,926
Had the body been properly examined,

68
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:24,867
traces of it would have been seen.

69
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:27,950
Poor Katherine.

70
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:32,041
There is little need to pray for her.

71
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,918
Her holy soul is in eternal rest.

72
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:38,100
But... I worry for her daughter.

73
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,653
Poor Mary.

74
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:45,833
We shall talk later.

75
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,056
Excellency.

76
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,530
Your Majesty.

77
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,338
I hear your master
is to be congratulated.

78
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:07,380
He has taken Tunis from the Turks.

79
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:09,996
Your Majesty is very well informed.

80
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:12,016
The threat of the Turkish invasion

81
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:14,937
has indeed been lifted
by the Emperor's victory.

82
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,189
Peace will follow.

83
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,450
Would it follow everywhere?

84
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,895
Yes, pray God.

85
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,950
Perhaps one day
there will be no more need for war,

86
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:25,947
or wars alarms.

87
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,396
In the meantime,

88
00:07:29,422 --> 00:07:32,197
please convey my love
and my congratulations to the Emperor.

89
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:34,328
Tell him that...

90
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,144
Tell him that,
of all the princes in the world,

91
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:41,922
I admire him the most.

92
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,619
Cromwell!

93
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:05,275
Now the Emperor has defeated the Turks,
his armies are free to turn upon us.

94
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,299
and a while ago,
I swear he would have done so.

95
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:10,083
But no longer.

96
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:14,219
With Katherine's death the cause
of our enmity is altogether taken away.

97
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:17,517
And I have a new desire
to renew my friendship with him.

98
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,510
You will talk to Chapuys.

99
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:23,349
You will find out
the cost of friendship.

100
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

101
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:26,965
What of our reforms?

102
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:30,253
The Bill for the dissolution
of the larger monasteries

103
00:08:30,353 --> 00:08:32,980
will be laid before Parliament
at the next session.

104
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,187
Mr. Cromwell.

105
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:36,880
Majesty.

106
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,585
There was something else.

107
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,859
I understand you have a wife and son.

108
00:08:42,827 --> 00:08:43,719
Yes.

109
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:46,197
What's your son's name?

110
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,313
Gregory.

111
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,356
I had two daughters also. But...

112
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:57,906
... they died.

113
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,715
You will bring
your wife and son to court.

114
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,030
I should like to meet them.

115
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:10,610
Yes, Majesty.

116
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,650
Your Majesty.

117
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,695
If Your Majesty will follow me.

118
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,109
Good people,

119
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:23,304
Welcome.

120
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:26,582
Here is the Queen's Majesty come,

121
00:10:27,096 --> 00:10:29,090
this Maundy Thursday,

122
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,843
to give you alms and wash your feet,

123
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:33,616
God bless you!

124
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,166
God keep you!

125
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:45,766
God in his mercy bless you and keep you.

126
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,014
Will you look! This is twice as much

127
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:51,884
as the old Queen gave!

128
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:53,515
God bless you.

129
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:15,228
Holiness, His Royal Highness,
the King of France

130
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:21,296
Majesty.

131
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:25,908
You come to us
as a pilgrim and a penitent.

132
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:30,152
Surely you deserve heaven's graces.

133
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,934
With all my heart,
I welcome you to Rome...

134
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,361
... the Mother of our Church,

135
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:46,906
When others fall by the wayside,

136
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,443
through vanity, avarice or lust...

137
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,190
you remain loyal to us,

138
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,115
and to the truth of Christ.

139
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,092
As a child to a father,

140
00:11:59,192 --> 00:12:02,230
I say to you here, in the presence

141
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:05,350
of all these princes of our Holy Church,

142
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:08,998
that I would gladly lay down my life

143
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:10,688
in order to serve you,

144
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:14,070
and in whatever way you choose.

145
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:21,373
I have decided to carry out

146
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:23,814
the Bull of Excommunication

147
00:12:23,914 --> 00:12:26,604
against King Henry of England.

148
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:29,835
A father must always seek for ways

149
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:31,826
to forgive his children,

150
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:35,927
but Henry's crimes against us
and against our faith

151
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,126
are too profound to forgive.

152
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,914
Moreover,

153
00:12:41,014 --> 00:12:42,961
he shows no repentance,

154
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:44,538
no contrition.

155
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:46,315
It's true.

156
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:48,981
The King of England has always been

157
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:51,598
the most difficult
friend to bear in the world.

158
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:54,507
He is continuously capricious.

159
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,172
In which case,

160
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:59,861
I am sure I can rely upon you

161
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:01,514
to execute the Bull.

162
00:13:03,272 --> 00:13:05,351
- Holiness?
- My son,

163
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:07,373
surely you realize,

164
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:11,561
if I excommunicate a fellow prince,

165
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:16,424
then that prince is not only
separated from God...

166
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:20,437
but also from
the communion of the faithful.

167
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,968
His rule becomes invalid.

168
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:26,950
And it is a religious imperative

169
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,666
to overthrow him.

170
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,143
You are a great Catholic Prince.

171
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:35,587
You have armies.
You have ships. You have guns.

172
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:40,069
So I ask you, in all humility,

173
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:43,990
as your Holy Father...

174
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,131
Will you invade England?

175
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:51,104
Will you remove and kill the apostate

176
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:54,280
and will you return that country

177
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,402
to our common faith?

178
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:17,819
The Seymours are
an old and interesting family.

179
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:21,793
Sir John fought beside the King
during his French campaign.

180
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:24,345
He also has two sons:

181
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:26,376
Edward and Thomas.

182
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:28,582
I hear the first is steady and cold,

183
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:30,705
the other rash.

184
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,398
But both are ambitious,

185
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:34,853
and greedy.

186
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:37,722
Though they have all taken the oath,

187
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:40,749
what is not yet known is
how honestly or completely

188
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:42,737
they have renounced the old religion.

189
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:46,154
It is something we must hope,
before long, to discover.

190
00:14:46,756 --> 00:14:47,938
And if we can?

191
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:49,606
Then,

192
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:53,946
the tide of their ambitions
can be turned, and will ebb away,

193
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:57,207
and we shall hear no more of them.

194
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,228
His Excellency, the Imperial Ambassador.

195
00:15:07,764 --> 00:15:09,213
Your Eminency.

196
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:10,981
You are most welcome.

197
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:12,853
Please be seated.

198
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:15,858
You are most gracious, Mr. Secretary.

199
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,957
As I told you,
His Majesty is most desirous

200
00:15:21,057 --> 00:15:23,163
to make an alliance with the Emperor.

201
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:27,185
I believe also that such an alliance

202
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:29,626
would be greatly
to the benefit of this country.

203
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:35,459
I have communicated with the Emperor.

204
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:38,042
He, also, is eager to find a way

205
00:15:38,142 --> 00:15:40,577
to make a new and strong alliance.

206
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,567
And to show his good will,

207
00:15:45,102 --> 00:15:48,243
I can tell you that he is willing
to persuade His Holiness,

208
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:50,704
Pope Paul, not to publish the sentence

209
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:52,685
of excommunication against the King,

210
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:56,362
which would have
deprived him of his throne.

211
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,388
I am sure His Majesty
would wish to express

212
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:03,487
his immense gratitude to your master.

213
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,689
And in return?

214
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,164
In the circumstances,

215
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:15,432
after the death of his beloved aunt,

216
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,224
Queen Katherine of England,

217
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:20,957
the Emperor is prepared
to offer the King his support

218
00:16:21,135 --> 00:16:23,716
for the continuation
of his marriage to Anne Boleyn.

219
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:26,756
But on condition

220
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,955
that the King... declares Princess Mary

221
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:33,077
to be his legitimate heir.

222
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:50,629
I accept this is, in many ways,

223
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:55,193
a most generous concession
on behalf of the Emperor.

224
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,287
He begs the King to understand

225
00:16:57,387 --> 00:17:00,250
it is as far as he is prepared to go.

226
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,132
I will certainly put your proposal
to His Majesty.

227
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:07,177
With your approval?

228
00:17:13,762 --> 00:17:16,626
Even with my approval, Excellency,

229
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:19,870
this may not be easy.

230
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,102
- She's pretty.
- Who?

231
00:17:37,526 --> 00:17:39,150
Lady Jane Seymour.

232
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,200
She's new at court.

233
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:42,627
Here.

234
00:17:44,706 --> 00:17:47,817
"If thou wilt mighty be,
flee from the rage of cruel will,

235
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:51,641
and see thou keep thee free
from the foul yoke of sensual bondage."

236
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,758
"The foul yoke of sensual bondage".
I like that!

237
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:59,054
Then you don't understand it
or how cruel the will that drives it.

238
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,220
Until you see the fruits
of sensual bondage

239
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,766
swinging from a rope.

240
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,489
- Lady Jane Seymour?
- Yes.

241
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:18,617
Forgive me, for there is someone
over here, a friend,

242
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:21,161
who wishes a word with you.
In private.

243
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:24,621
Which friend?

244
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:26,011
This way, my Lady.

245
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,589
Jane.

246
00:19:10,178 --> 00:19:11,483
Your Majesty.

247
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:31,487
I ask you only one thing:

248
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,135
that you allow me
to serve and worship you.

249
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:40,092
As Lancelot served
and worshipped Guinevere.

250
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:44,041
Sweet gentle Lady,

251
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:45,767
will you let me so?

252
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:55,844
I will.

253
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:03,435
May I kiss your hand?

254
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:22,160
My Lady.

255
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,533
Do you know them?

256
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:01,632
Who? Know who?

257
00:21:02,642 --> 00:21:03,871
The Seymours.

258
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:07,335
I may have met Edward, the eldest son.

259
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:10,085
He's a cold fish.

260
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,242
I don't know about the others.

261
00:21:14,843 --> 00:21:16,283
Are you afraid of them?

262
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:19,303
Father thinks they may be
secret supporters of Mary.

263
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:21,277
Ah, Mary, Mary...

264
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:25,204
It's a pity she's not keeping company
with her mother.

265
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:30,728
They tell me she is ill again,

266
00:21:31,445 --> 00:21:34,036
and that the King has given permission
for her removal

267
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:36,361
from Elizabeth's household,
for her comfort.

268
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,989
It's an act of kindness.
No more than that.

269
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:41,729
No. He's fond of her.

270
00:21:42,143 --> 00:21:44,585
He always was and he still is,
though he pretends

271
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:46,163
differently to my face.

272
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,581
How ill is she?

273
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:50,393
Very. So I am told.

274
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,969
With a fever and constant vomiting.

275
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,363
Then, with God's good grace,

276
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,386
we may not have
to meddle with her after all.

277
00:22:15,343 --> 00:22:17,184
The King has offered to serve you?

278
00:22:17,284 --> 00:22:18,500
Yes, father.

279
00:22:19,435 --> 00:22:21,040
I am not surprised.

280
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:24,696
And it means he does not seek
an easy conquest.

281
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,840
He has formed an affection.

282
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:29,374
What's important is that it should be

283
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,980
carefully and assiduously nurtured.

284
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,704
I must urge you not to submit yourself

285
00:22:37,804 --> 00:22:39,820
and yield your virginity to the King,

286
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:43,133
however forceful his persuasions is.

287
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:47,241
Jane does not need to be lectured
on the need for virtue or modesty,

288
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:49,930
when she possesses them in her nature.

289
00:22:50,353 --> 00:22:51,377
Still,

290
00:22:52,025 --> 00:22:54,780
imagine what it would
mean for us, as a family,

291
00:22:55,071 --> 00:22:57,174
if he did grow to love her.

292
00:22:58,693 --> 00:23:00,392
I am certainly aware there are

293
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,782
some at court who would like
to see the Queen replaced.

294
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,628
Wait!

295
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:11,372
I thought...

296
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,774
Are you saying that I should be
Queen instead of her?

297
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:20,955
Would you like to be?

298
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,479
Tell me, Sir Henry,

299
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,220
are you engaged yet to Lady Margaret?

300
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:35,768
No, Your Majesty. I am...

301
00:23:36,576 --> 00:23:39,168
I have not so far asked for her hand.

302
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,065
For God's sake, man!

303
00:23:42,055 --> 00:23:43,313
She's young.

304
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:45,557
She's...

305
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:50,031
She will give you more children,
I know it.

306
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:52,286
And I know it, Your Majesty. But...

307
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,230
I was married before and,

308
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,645
I must confess,
I rather like the liberty

309
00:23:56,745 --> 00:23:58,530
of not being married again.

310
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:03,904
That I can understand.

311
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,310
You know what, Sir Henry?

312
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,150
You're courting a young lady

313
00:24:15,782 --> 00:24:16,805
and I'm...

314
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,026
We should joust together again,

315
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,299
as we used to.

316
00:24:27,702 --> 00:24:30,151
You always did grace the tiltyard.

317
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:32,840
We ran many courses against each other

318
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,540
and broke many lances.

319
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,836
We should do it again...

320
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,695
and you can organize it.

321
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:43,388
Soon.

322
00:24:44,714 --> 00:24:45,953
Majesty.

323
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:10,679
Ah, sweetheart! What is it?

324
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,500
Where have you been?

325
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,352
I told you.

326
00:25:15,452 --> 00:25:16,695
I had meetings.

327
00:25:17,372 --> 00:25:19,184
Privy Council matters.

328
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,503
- Until this hour?
- Yes.

329
00:25:22,384 --> 00:25:24,309
The King's affairs never sleep.

330
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,489
And what of your affairs?

331
00:25:30,002 --> 00:25:31,157
My affairs?

332
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:37,417
You have just come from another's bed.

333
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:38,385
No...

334
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,403
Do not deny it!

335
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,212
Very well. I shan't.

336
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,799
What makes it worse
is that you have not forsaken

337
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:54,801
my bed for that of another woman,

338
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:01,900
but for another man.

339
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,246
Oh God! Oh my God!

340
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:13,540
Oh my God! It's true!

341
00:26:14,685 --> 00:26:15,910
Oh, my God!

342
00:26:16,578 --> 00:26:17,752
It's disgusting!

343
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:19,171
It's a sin.

344
00:26:19,443 --> 00:26:21,706
It's a sin against God.

345
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,440
A sin against nature.

346
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:28,120
And those who practice it
are condemned by the Gospels

347
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,363
to live forever in purgatory.

348
00:26:30,731 --> 00:26:32,994
Sometimes, my love,

349
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:35,078
I think that with you...

350
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,859
I'm already condemned
to live in purgatory!

351
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:05,655
For you, my lady.

352
00:27:08,616 --> 00:27:10,419
You have fine husband.

353
00:27:25,608 --> 00:27:27,561
Point for the Duke of Suffolk.

354
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:33,121
Gentlemen, renew your lances

355
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:37,104
Is Her Majesty not attending
the tournament today?

356
00:27:37,844 --> 00:27:41,064
No. Apparently she's worried
that the excitements of the tournament

357
00:27:41,164 --> 00:27:42,898
might harm her unborn son.

358
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,035
Or so she supposes it to be.

359
00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:49,442
Personally, I hope she did not
visit the same astrologer as before.

360
00:28:05,494 --> 00:28:06,960
Lady Jane...

361
00:28:08,675 --> 00:28:09,886
Your Majesty.

362
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:12,340
I am about to go and joust.

363
00:28:13,382 --> 00:28:16,499
Would you do me the honor
of allowing me to wear your favors?

364
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:36,828
A point to the Duke of Suffolk.

365
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:41,931
Match come to the Duke of Suffolk.

366
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:12,930
His Majesty the King
has entered the list

367
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:15,920
and will now joust, à la plaisance,

368
00:29:16,313 --> 00:29:18,172
with Sir Henry Norris.

369
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:27,637
Well done, Charles.

370
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,239
- Well done, my love.
- Thank you.

371
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,062
Move, move!

372
00:30:32,106 --> 00:30:33,585
Is he dead, is he dead?

373
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:37,526
Let others help him. You can't.

374
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:49,360
Take him with all care
into the pavilion,

375
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:52,083
where I may serve him better.

376
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:55,525
And pray for him.

377
00:30:58,972 --> 00:31:00,699
- Seymour! Boleyn!
- Your Grace.

378
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,022
Madam! Oh Madam!

379
00:31:35,264 --> 00:31:37,781
Madge. What is it? What's happened?

380
00:31:38,743 --> 00:31:40,830
- Madge, what's happened?
- Oh, Madam,

381
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,695
the King has fallen from his horse
and has been crushed.

382
00:31:45,023 --> 00:31:45,871
They...

383
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,570
they say he is likely to die.

384
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,505
Mark...

385
00:31:57,252 --> 00:31:58,989
Say it is not so.

386
00:32:01,592 --> 00:32:03,066
Please no!

387
00:32:05,745 --> 00:32:08,224
Oh God! Please, say it is not so...

388
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:14,598
His heart is very weak.

389
00:32:14,698 --> 00:32:16,881
I don't know if he will come back to us.

390
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,961
- Will you bleed him?
- I don't think so, your Grace.

391
00:32:23,061 --> 00:32:25,110
I do not see it would help him.

392
00:32:26,513 --> 00:32:29,226
His Majesty
is now in the hands of God.

393
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:39,072
Confitebimur tibi deus.

394
00:32:39,806 --> 00:32:43,215
Confitebimur et invocabimus nomen tuum.

395
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,523
- Where are we going?
- Back to Whitehall.

396
00:32:45,623 --> 00:32:47,275
Don't you understand anything?

397
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,453
In such a crisis,
all could disintegrate.

398
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:52,493
So the centre has to hold.
And we must hold it.

399
00:32:52,593 --> 00:32:54,719
Mr. Secretary. A letter from Dover, Sir.

400
00:32:58,357 --> 00:32:59,634
Mr. Secretary...

401
00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:04,170
- News?
- There is no news.

402
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,402
The King still shows no signs of life.

403
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:11,511
- How long since the accident?
- Almost an hour ago, Your Honor.

404
00:33:23,226 --> 00:33:25,763
Confitebimur tibi deus.

405
00:33:25,863 --> 00:33:28,857
Confitebimur et invocabimus nomen tuum.

406
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:32,247
Narrabimus mirabilia tua.

407
00:33:33,014 --> 00:33:36,779
Cum accepero tempus
ego iustitias iudicabo...

408
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,503
What is to be done?

409
00:34:05,603 --> 00:34:08,016
I'm making preparations,
in the event of the King's death,

410
00:34:08,116 --> 00:34:11,156
for the coronation of the Princess
Elizabeth with your lordship's approval.

411
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:15,478
She would be in a minority,
but under the worship of her mother and

412
00:34:15,578 --> 00:34:17,367
with yourself as Lord Protector.

413
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:20,394
And have you posted a guard
on my Lady Mary? And closed the ports?

414
00:34:20,494 --> 00:34:21,843
All that is in hand.

415
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:24,790
As are preparations
for an emergency recall of Parliament.

416
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:28,046
King's had no need
of parliament in the old days!

417
00:34:28,146 --> 00:34:30,426
These are not the old days, my Lord.

418
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:28,160
You know, I cannot think,

419
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:31,090
whether it would be a bad thing,

420
00:35:31,744 --> 00:35:33,537
or a good thing, if he died.

421
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,570
For, as Lord Protector, you would,

422
00:35:39,491 --> 00:35:40,946
ipso facto,

423
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,995
be King of England.

424
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:13,506
Your Majesty?

425
00:37:26,903 --> 00:37:28,002
Charles.

426
00:37:30,976 --> 00:37:32,980
Oh thank God. He's alive!

427
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:46,242
Come on gentlemen, out, out!

428
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:47,393
What's that?

429
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,936
We must be grateful that his Majesty
took no hurt in his fall.

430
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,341
Yes, thank God.

431
00:38:06,997 --> 00:38:10,790
But it means that the safe production
of a son from your womb

432
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,593
is more than ever imperative.

433
00:38:13,633 --> 00:38:16,582
So I beg you to be always careful

434
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:18,076
with yourself.

435
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,737
Take no exertions or excitements.

436
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:25,983
Shut yourself away
as much as you can from the world.

437
00:38:26,503 --> 00:38:30,483
I wish there was a way I could remove
Mistress Seymour from among my ladies.

438
00:38:31,034 --> 00:38:33,551
But I dare not.
I think it would anger the King.

439
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:35,351
This is what I mean.

440
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,274
If you fret about such little matters

441
00:38:38,374 --> 00:38:41,950
then your thoughts
may poison the child inside you.

442
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:45,093
It is not a little matter to me.

443
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:48,267
It is for now.

444
00:38:49,488 --> 00:38:50,478
Afterwards,

445
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:53,031
when you have given
the King his great desire,

446
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,894
then you will have
all the power to deal with her

447
00:38:55,994 --> 00:38:57,068
as you like.

448
00:39:01,169 --> 00:39:03,272
Think that I am the angel

449
00:39:04,157 --> 00:39:05,697
come down to tell you

450
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:09,049
that you carry the Christ child

451
00:39:09,149 --> 00:39:10,344
in your belly.

452
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,172
- What is it?
- Because of the fall

453
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:42,968
this old wound
on your leg has re-opened,

454
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:45,156
and an ulcer has formed.

455
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,150
- Can you heal it?
- Most certainly, Majesty.

456
00:39:48,464 --> 00:39:51,384
But for now you must wear a dressing
and have the leg bound up.

457
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,429
Though Your Majesty
is still a young man,

458
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,321
you are not as young as used to.

459
00:40:00,954 --> 00:40:02,447
In those days,

460
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,462
you could joust a whole day

461
00:40:05,562 --> 00:40:07,399
and not feel the effect...

462
00:40:16,552 --> 00:40:18,978
<i>I have a message from the King
for your daughter,</i>

463
00:40:19,078 --> 00:40:20,526
<i>and for her ears alone.</i>

464
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:25,836
Ah! Jane.

465
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,517
- Your Grace.
- Lady Jane.

466
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:39,705
His Majesty is pleased
to send you this letter.

467
00:40:41,053 --> 00:40:42,238
And this purse.

468
00:40:42,338 --> 00:40:45,801
He commends you to accept these gifts
in the spirit in which they're offered.

469
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:21,137
I am so happy you're well.
I was so alarmed, so afraid.

470
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:22,992
So was I...

471
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,625
when I thought that through
my foolishness you might lose the child.

472
00:41:26,725 --> 00:41:28,418
Your foolishness?

473
00:41:29,068 --> 00:41:31,990
It was a mistake to think
I could behave as I used to.

474
00:41:33,647 --> 00:41:34,906
In any case,

475
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,428
those carefree days are gone.

476
00:41:44,748 --> 00:41:46,955
Our daughter was brought to court.

477
00:41:47,055 --> 00:41:49,208
And everyone admired her.

478
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,757
I think she will be a great beauty.

479
00:41:52,444 --> 00:41:53,664
Of course she will.

480
00:41:54,997 --> 00:41:56,288
Look at her mother.

481
00:42:02,195 --> 00:42:05,603
Will you not ask King Francis
to reconsider his refusal?

482
00:42:06,448 --> 00:42:09,298
If we delay much longer
to find a good marriage for Elizabeth,

483
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:11,804
people will talk,
even more than they do already.

484
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,360
Why do you talk of Elizabeth,

485
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:16,809
when Mary is not yet betrothed.

486
00:42:18,714 --> 00:42:21,747
Surely you have more of a care
for your legitimate daughter?

487
00:42:22,389 --> 00:42:23,447
Charles!

488
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:40,651
What did she say?

489
00:42:41,338 --> 00:42:43,986
She returned the letter unopened,
and the purse both.

490
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,269
She said that she has no greater
treasure in this world than her honor,

491
00:42:48,722 --> 00:42:52,470
and that if you want to give her money,
she praise you might do so

492
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:55,660
when she has made an honorable marriage.

493
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,550
She has behaved herself
in this matter most modestly.

494
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,435
His Excellency the Imperial Ambassador.

495
00:43:29,285 --> 00:43:30,731
Excellency.

496
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:34,637
I wondered if you had put
the Emperor's proposal to the King?

497
00:43:36,057 --> 00:43:37,333
Not exactly.

498
00:43:42,674 --> 00:43:45,452
I wish with all my heart
that we could reach

499
00:43:45,552 --> 00:43:47,637
a speedy accommodation. However,

500
00:43:48,605 --> 00:43:52,400
in the question
of legitimizing the Lady Mary,

501
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,340
there remains one great obstacle.

502
00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:56,200
You mean the Queen?

503
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:03,470
I know she hates the Emperor
as Katherine's nephew.

504
00:44:04,023 --> 00:44:05,188
They say

505
00:44:05,288 --> 00:44:08,379
that when she was told
of his victory over the Turks,

506
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,700
she looked like a dog
being thrown out of a window.

507
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,216
But what can we do?

508
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,434
If there is an obstacle
in our path, Excellency,

509
00:44:31,743 --> 00:44:33,376
we must find a way around it.

510
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,507
Lady Jane.

511
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,167
Majesty.

512
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:12,054
I pray you come closer.

513
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:17,650
Closer still.

514
00:45:18,748 --> 00:45:19,696
Here...

515
00:45:20,663 --> 00:45:21,910
sit on my knee.

516
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:25,416
Don't be afraid.

517
00:45:37,715 --> 00:45:39,142
I respect your honor,

518
00:45:40,907 --> 00:45:42,109
believe me.

519
00:45:44,802 --> 00:45:48,440
In the future, I will not see you unless
your other family members are present.

520
00:45:50,235 --> 00:45:51,803
I just had to see you now.

521
00:45:53,757 --> 00:45:54,977
Yes, Your Majesty.

522
00:45:59,117 --> 00:46:00,722
Your favor saved my life.

523
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:03,508
- No...
- Yes!

524
00:46:04,715 --> 00:46:06,856
As I lay there, your image came to me,

525
00:46:08,088 --> 00:46:10,116
and I awoke with this promise.

526
00:46:12,786 --> 00:46:14,157
What should I say?

527
00:46:16,915 --> 00:46:18,675
Will you let me kiss you, Jane?

528
00:46:35,858 --> 00:46:36,994
Once more.

529
00:46:45,493 --> 00:46:46,601
Oh, my God!

530
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:49,605
Oh, my God! What is this?

531
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:51,386
What is this?

532
00:46:56,567 --> 00:46:58,920
Just when my belly
is doing its business,

533
00:46:59,187 --> 00:47:01,642
I find you wenching
with Mistress Seymour.

534
00:47:01,742 --> 00:47:04,065
Sweetheart.
Jane, you had best leave.

535
00:47:06,503 --> 00:47:08,043
Why are you doing this?

536
00:47:08,735 --> 00:47:11,233
Why did you have to do this?

537
00:47:13,187 --> 00:47:14,454
Peace...

538
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,723
Stop it!

539
00:47:39,501 --> 00:47:40,675
Two knaves...

540
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:44,443
Two queens and a king.

541
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:46,555
You win.

542
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,400
Do you think I should go and see...

543
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,540
Let her sleep.

544
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:07,675
What is, Your Majesty?

545
00:48:14,546 --> 00:48:16,366
- The baby...
- My God!

546
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:18,712
My boy!

547
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,000
Get some help.

548
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:22,979
- Hurry.
- No... no...

549
00:49:12,729 --> 00:49:14,380
You have lost my boy.

550
00:49:17,173 --> 00:49:18,660
I cannot speak of it,

551
00:49:19,802 --> 00:49:21,254
the loss is too great,

552
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:24,530
but I see now

553
00:49:25,161 --> 00:49:27,927
that God will not grant me
any male children.

554
00:49:31,842 --> 00:49:33,229
When you are up,

555
00:49:33,999 --> 00:49:35,740
I will speak with you.

556
00:49:37,522 --> 00:49:39,381
It is not all my fault.

557
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:47,070
You have no one to blame
but yourself for this.

558
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:51,075
I was distressed to see you
with that wench Jane Seymour.

559
00:49:51,513 --> 00:49:53,546
Because the love I bear you

560
00:49:53,646 --> 00:49:55,697
is so great.

561
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,539
It broke my heart
to see you loved others.

562
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:18,640
I said I will speak with you

563
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:21,426
when you are well.

564
00:50:57,065 --> 00:50:58,252
It's true...

565
00:50:58,862 --> 00:51:00,326
what they have whispered.

566
00:51:03,069 --> 00:51:04,543
I shut my ears to them,

567
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,134
but now I know it to be true.

568
00:51:10,538 --> 00:51:12,331
I made this marriage

569
00:51:12,898 --> 00:51:14,840
seduced by witchcraft.

570
00:51:16,216 --> 00:51:18,827
And for that reason
consider it to be null

571
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:20,772
and void.

572
00:51:22,593 --> 00:51:25,892
And the evidence is that God
will not permit us

573
00:51:26,071 --> 00:51:27,207
male issue...

574
00:51:33,044 --> 00:51:34,630
so now I believe,

575
00:51:36,145 --> 00:51:38,098
with all my heart,

576
00:51:41,261 --> 00:51:43,148
that I will take another wife.
