1
00:00:00,377 --> 00:00:01,751
<i>Previously, on The Tudors.</i>

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,084
The king of Scotland is not coming.
But worse,

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,840
His army has ridden over the border
and is harrying our people

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,856
and killing all those
who oppose them.

5
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:12,846
Sir Thomas, you'll order our troops
to retaliate with burnings and killings.

6
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,639
3 hurts to every one of ours.

7
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:17,970
Those men that are made
by the king of vile birth

8
00:00:18,137 --> 00:00:21,062
have been the distraction
of all the nobility of this realm.

9
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:25,108
And if God calls away the King,
they will suffer for it.

10
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:27,777
The Emperor and the King of France
are on the brink of war.

11
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:31,656
You will convey to your master it'd be
foolish to contemplate an invasion.

12
00:00:32,123 --> 00:00:36,127
On the contrary, he regards England
as his natural ally against the Emperor.

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,595
I mean to show these French that I won't
shy away from battle if I am provoked.

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,328
Until recently, nothing but war
had been talked of.

15
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:48,311
Something inside me is disappointed.
It hungers for a war.

16
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:51,354
I actually thought the French
might oblige me this time?

17
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:53,928
The letter accuses Queen Katherine
of dissolute living

18
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:57,015
before she was married
and that her way of life isn't a secret.

19
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,727
Do not desist until you've reached
the bottom of the pot.

20
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:03,647
You are confined to your apartments
for as long as it please the King.

21
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:06,900
Why? Why must I stay here?

22
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,544
- Francis Dereham, you are under arrest.
- Under arrest? For what?

23
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:13,156
I don't believe that you didn't have
carnal knowledge of the Queen.

24
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,879
Someone else has succeeded me
in her affections!

25
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:17,923
- Who?
- Thomas Culpepper.

26
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:20,413
But it was Katherine who led me on.

27
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,151
She wanted it, not me.

28
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:24,834
"Katherine Howard, you led the King
by word and gesture to love you,

29
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,003
"concealing your contract
with Francis Dereham,

30
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:29,945
"and after marriage, you showed
the same Dereham notable favour

31
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,218
"while inciting Thomas Culpepper
to carnal knowledge,

32
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,470
"telling him you love him
above the King."

33
00:01:36,174 --> 00:01:38,552
What has happened is your fault.

34
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:40,833
You solicited me to marry her.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,645
How misfortunate I am
to have so many ill-conditioned wives.

36
00:01:49,046 --> 00:01:50,754
No! Henry!

37
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,902
Henry's Team

39
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,610
Tr.: YYets.

40
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,865
Are you dressed?

41
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:22,285
Not quite, I was reading.

42
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,204
Come and sit. I have some news.

43
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,587
- What is it?
- I just heard!

44
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:34,597
By Act of Parliament,

45
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:37,675
you and I are both
restored to the succession.

46
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:40,261
After Edward and his heirs,
of course.

47
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:43,307
The King himself
must have commanded this.

48
00:03:45,144 --> 00:03:46,902
Are you not pleased, Elizabeth?

49
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,478
Think what this means.

50
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,106
Yes, Mary. If you are pleased
then so am I.

51
00:03:53,928 --> 00:03:56,319
It means that the King
loves both of us.

52
00:03:57,314 --> 00:03:59,113
And that you may be Queen some day.

53
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,459
And you,

54
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:02,885
Queen Elizabeth.

55
00:04:09,103 --> 00:04:10,166
What's wrong?

56
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,469
Because of what happened
to Queen Katherine,

57
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,691
I have made my mind up.

58
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:19,747
In what?

59
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:23,215
As God is my witness,

60
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:26,227
I shall never marry!

61
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:29,474
Never!

62
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:41,992
Your Majesty, His Excellency
the Imperial Ambassador.

63
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:48,708
- Excellency.
- Your Majesty.

64
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:52,667
Your Majesty is most gracious.

65
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:00,879
I am sure Your Majesty is aware.

66
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:04,625
My master, the Emperor
is once more at war

67
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:06,465
with King Francis.

68
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:10,351
The French King's despicable
alliance with the Turk

69
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:13,838
threatens not only the borders
of the Emperor's domains,

70
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,874
but also the security
of the whole of Europe.

71
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:19,312
For that reason alone,

72
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,113
his Imperial Majesty has asked me

73
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:25,806
to offer the hand of friendship
to Your Majesty once more,

74
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,369
in joint alliance

75
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:31,294
against the perfidious French.

76
00:05:32,237 --> 00:05:33,637
What would I gain?

77
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:36,191
All your lost territories.

78
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:41,115
The whole of Aquitaine.

79
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,771
Excellency.

80
00:06:05,604 --> 00:06:06,604
Risley!

81
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:18,598
Excellency.

82
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:26,399
His Excellency,
the French Ambassador.

83
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:31,057
- Monsieur Marillac.
- Your Majesty.

84
00:06:31,747 --> 00:06:34,248
I hear your country is at war,
with the Emperor.

85
00:06:34,549 --> 00:06:35,561
Indeed.

86
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:39,534
The Emperor has broken all his promises
and treaty obligations,

87
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:42,531
both to my master King Francis,

88
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:43,945
and to you.

89
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,070
Monsieur Marillac,

90
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:48,889
when you signed a treaty,
your master agreed to pay

91
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:50,682
an annual pension to this country,

92
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:53,267
which he has defaulted on
for the past two years.

93
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:56,741
As a consequence, he now owes
arrears of a million crowns.

94
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,856
- Majesty, if that is true...
- You doubt my word, Monsieur Marillac?

95
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,020
Then...

96
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:05,515
His Majesty will be informed.

97
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,802
And redress will surely follow.

98
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,685
The alliance between our countries

99
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:19,731
has kept the balance of power
in Europe for over ten years.

100
00:07:20,293 --> 00:07:24,297
Surely Your Majesty would not care
to compromise that arrangement now,

101
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:27,447
in the face of Imperial aggression?

102
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,343
I want you to write a letter
to the King of the Scots.

103
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:51,788
Tell him that we invite him
to sign a treaty

104
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:54,276
acknowledging our suzerainty
over his country.

105
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:57,106
Also to tell him to stop
his French and Papal alliances,

106
00:07:57,273 --> 00:07:59,036
or suffer the consequences for it.

107
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:02,314
I want you to prepare
to go to Scotland

108
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:05,053
in case my cousin refuses
to concede to our demands.

109
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:07,445
And take Surrey with you.

110
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:39,192
You play very well, Mr. Leigh.

111
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:43,397
Always the sign of a wasted life.

112
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:46,035
You know,

113
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,464
you and I have

114
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:50,142
more in common

115
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,907
than you might imagine, my Lord.

116
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,290
What?

117
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,452
Our families

118
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,057
both come from St. Mary's parish
in Stockwell

119
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:03,734
and our chapels were
founded in the same year.

120
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:07,213
That hardly makes us equal,
Mr. Leigh.

121
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:09,914
There is another thing.

122
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:13,136
Like you,

123
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:16,542
my family... was related

124
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:18,920
to the late Queen.

125
00:09:24,903 --> 00:09:28,276
Do not you think it unseemly
to raise her ghost at court?

126
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:31,149
I think it unseemly

127
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,685
that you Howards turned a blind eye
to her despicable wantonness,

128
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:39,170
which tarnished the reputations
of all of us associated with her!

129
00:09:39,484 --> 00:09:40,684
"You Howards!"

130
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:47,545
Is that what you just said?

131
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:53,146
"You Howards"?!

132
00:09:58,535 --> 00:09:59,535
Guards!

133
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:05,243
I'll cut your tongue out,
so help me God!

134
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,755
I'll cut your fucking tongue out!

135
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:09,917
Get off me!

136
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,434
Lord Latimer,

137
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:23,122
Sir Thomas Seymour.

138
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:28,419
How good of you to come.

139
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:33,413
Please...

140
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:36,282
Please forgive my infirmities.

141
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:39,385
As you can see, I am not a well man.

142
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:42,337
I trust your Lordship
will soon recover.

143
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:46,970
I am afraid my health
is too far broken to be mended.

144
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,901
Allow me to present my wife,

145
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,401
Catherine Parr.

146
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,655
Catherine, Sir Thomas Seymour.

147
00:11:01,863 --> 00:11:04,372
Please. Sit down, Sir Thomas.

148
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:10,585
I do not know if you are aware
of my personal history?

149
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:15,091
The Latimers are
an old northern family.

150
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:20,012
And, unfortunately, we were caught up in
the late Rebellion against His Majesty.

151
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,170
I myself,

152
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:26,148
was taken hostage by Robert Aske

153
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:29,051
and sore constrained by him.

154
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:34,231
His Majesty demanded that
I reject Aske which I did,

155
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:36,698
and came to London to submit to him.

156
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:41,393
Still I think the shadow of treason
hangs over me and my family.

157
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:46,244
I know you have the ear of the King.

158
00:11:47,676 --> 00:11:49,542
I would like you to make submission

159
00:11:49,972 --> 00:11:52,049
on my behalf to His Majesty,

160
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:57,462
of my utter loyalty...

161
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:03,817
There, my darling.

162
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:15,458
Close your eyes and rest now.

163
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:49,685
Do you think he suspects anything?

164
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,680
No, nothing. I'm sure of it.

165
00:12:54,762 --> 00:12:56,650
He cannot be long for this world.

166
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,572
Hush! Don't say such things.

167
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:01,989
I only meant that I cannot wait until
we can be together, and married.

168
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:06,631
As truly as God is God,

169
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:10,597
I desire to marry you
above all others.

170
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:21,801
The Earl of Surrey has written
a letter to Your Majesty's Council.

171
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:25,321
The Earl is presently
detained at the Fleet Prison.

172
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:27,385
Prison? What for?

173
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,266
It seems he was in an affray

174
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:33,182
with one John Leigh
within the verge of the court

175
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:35,147
and was arrested by
the Sergeant-at-Arms.

176
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,895
The cause of the quarrel?

177
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:39,503
I believe it touched upon...

178
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,112
his Lordship's pride.

179
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:50,079
- What does he write?
- He demands his immediate release.

180
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,498
- Have you replied?
- We informed his Lordship

181
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:56,710
that his lack of humility would only
impair his prospects of liberty.

182
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:04,068
And why does he say
he should be released?

183
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:06,326
He infers that the Earl of Surrey

184
00:14:06,493 --> 00:14:09,515
has no business being
so treated in the first place.

185
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,476
He also speaks

186
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,438
of his readiness to serve
Your Majesty on active duty.

187
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,133
I think he is the most foolish
proud man in all of England.

188
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,037
Set a high surety on his future
behaviour, but release him.

189
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:30,978
I want him in Scotland.

190
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,983
<i>Go on with your Scottish pride!</i>

191
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,999
My Lord Surrey, here are three
of their nobles captured in battle.

192
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,650
Lord Cassilis, Lord Glencairn,

193
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,099
and Lord Maxwell.

194
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,820
My Lords,

195
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,406
you will be treated
with the honor and respect

196
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,741
due to your rank and station.

197
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:13,204
In the name of His Majesty,
King Henry VIII,

198
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,624
I invite you to return
with us to London,

199
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:18,731
where you will be most
comfortably housed.

200
00:15:19,312 --> 00:15:22,724
However, I must ask you
to surrender your swords.

201
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:26,050
Aye.

202
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,935
<i>Come with those horses
and bring the rope!</i>

203
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:40,272
My Lords, a great victory
was had by us at Solway Moss.

204
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,766
Thanks to my Lord Hertford
and to my Lord Surrey,

205
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:47,637
several Scottish nobles were captured
and are held here at our pleasure.

206
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:51,033
But that, my lords,
is not the end to our good news.

207
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:55,704
Distracted by his grievous defeat,
the King of the Scots took to his bed,

208
00:15:56,592 --> 00:15:58,999
and died just two days ago.

209
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,546
And on that day, his wife
gave birth to their only child.

210
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,723
And it was not the son and heir
that they had hoped for,

211
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:08,467
but a girl.

212
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,262
Your Majesty,

213
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:15,224
I think we should see it
as an act of divine intervention,

214
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:18,333
this passing of the Scottish crown

215
00:16:18,702 --> 00:16:20,574
to a very young female...

216
00:16:21,804 --> 00:16:23,053
Thanks be to God.

217
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,900
Thanks be to God, indeed.

218
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:28,045
It shall be a very happy Christmas.

219
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:31,960
In the absence of a Queen, I've asked
Mary to preside over the festivities.

220
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:35,652
Also, my son will be performing
his first public duties.

221
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,745
- My Lords.
- Your Majesty.

222
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:55,598
I was told you considered my treatment
of the Earl of Surrey far too lenient.

223
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:59,453
You said he deserved
a greater punishment.

224
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:03,063
- I simply thought...
- What business do you have to think?

225
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:05,869
If I were you I would not think,

226
00:17:06,036 --> 00:17:08,277
if thinking makes me come
to the wrong conclusion.

227
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,071
Get out, Tom.

228
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,036
- You look beautiful.
- My Lord.

229
00:17:26,203 --> 00:17:28,431
May I wish you
a very happy Christmas.

230
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:33,510
- Lady Mary.
- Catherine.

231
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:39,642
How is Lord Latimer?

232
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:41,449
No better.

233
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:44,271
He did not feel strong enough
to come to court.

234
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:47,139
I am so sad for him and for you.

235
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,568
I pray for both of you.

236
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:51,922
I thank you for that.

237
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,365
I will give him your good wishes,

238
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,075
and Happy Christmas.

239
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,618
Happy Christmas.

240
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:02,191
<i>His Excellency,
the French Ambassador.</i>

241
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,467
Excellence.

242
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,319
Enchanté!

243
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:24,394
<i>Prince Edward and Lady Elizabeth.</i>

244
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:25,994
Edward.

245
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:28,871
Don't be so impatient.

246
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:30,859
<i>The Earl and Lady Hertford.</i>

247
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:35,437
Prince Edward.

248
00:18:37,364 --> 00:18:39,993
My Lords, may I present His Grace,

249
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:42,287
- Prince Edward.
- My Lords.

250
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:44,164
Your Grace.

251
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:48,377
You are most welcome to His Majesty's
court at this Christmas time.

252
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:51,788
Your Grace is very kind
to speak to us in person.

253
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,757
I have been practicing.

254
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:55,676
Well done. Now come.

255
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,555
<i>Lady Scofield and Lady Davit.</i>

256
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:00,347
My Lords,

257
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:03,016
the King has a proposal
to put to you.

258
00:19:03,428 --> 00:19:05,914
There should be a peace
treaty between our countries

259
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:08,706
and a formal betrothal
between Prince Edward

260
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:11,233
and the newly born
Princess Mary of Scots.

261
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,876
The King is not unaware
of possible difficulties.

262
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:23,102
Which is why,
if you support the cause,

263
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:25,497
you will be rewarded
with a handsome pension

264
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:28,792
and will be released at once
to return to Scotland.

265
00:19:29,444 --> 00:19:32,254
I am sure your families are missing
you greatly at this time of year.

266
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,303
I know how I should feel, if I were
separated from my own dear wife.

267
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:44,308
Your Grace.
Welcome back to court.

268
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:47,780
- Is the Duchess not with you?
- No.

269
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:49,258
She's...

270
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:54,999
the Duchess does as she pleases.

271
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,571
We live mostly separate lives.

272
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,071
I'm very sorry.

273
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:01,800
I will pray for your reconciliation.

274
00:20:05,023 --> 00:20:06,830
How is the King?

275
00:20:10,764 --> 00:20:13,814
He has been melancholy
as you might have supposed.

276
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:17,787
I think he despairs of finding
any happiness in this life.

277
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:21,425
But in the last few weeks
his mood has altogether changed.

278
00:20:21,592 --> 00:20:23,335
Why, I cannot explain.

279
00:20:23,612 --> 00:20:25,454
Triumph in Scotland, perhaps?

280
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,638
- Your Grace.
- <i>His Majesty the King!</i>

281
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:41,397
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas Your Majesty!

282
00:21:31,404 --> 00:21:32,404
Bravo!

283
00:21:54,871 --> 00:21:56,607
- Your Majesty.
- What is it?

284
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,694
The Lady Latimer is come
to petition Your Majesty

285
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,886
to lift the suspicion of treason
from her husband, Lord Latimer.

286
00:22:04,296 --> 00:22:05,376
Where is she?

287
00:22:17,643 --> 00:22:19,630
What does any of this
have to do with you, Tom?

288
00:22:20,383 --> 00:22:21,983
Nothing, Your Majesty.

289
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,809
Except that I'm a friend
of the family.

290
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:29,765
I believe in Lord Latimer's
complete loyalty to Your Majesty.

291
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:33,727
I think your mind works another way
and to another purpose.

292
00:22:34,432 --> 00:22:36,032
No, no. Don't deny it!

293
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,940
Nor can I blame you.

294
00:22:38,943 --> 00:22:40,984
She is still a very handsome woman,

295
00:22:41,964 --> 00:22:44,821
and soon to be a very rich widow.

296
00:22:45,888 --> 00:22:47,188
Bring her to me.

297
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:51,747
- Your Majesty.
- Tom.

298
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:53,524
- Lady Mary.
- My Lord.

299
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:03,465
My apologies, I have recently been away
from court. I am not privy to the King.

300
00:23:04,081 --> 00:23:05,584
Ambassador, excuse me.

301
00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:18,230
You've been a long time
absent from court, Your Grace!

302
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,024
Only to tend to my estates,
Your Majesty.

303
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:24,867
I rather thought you'd been
careful of me.

304
00:23:25,978 --> 00:23:28,233
You imagine
I'm still angry with you.

305
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:33,668
You can be too careful, Your Grace.

306
00:23:33,835 --> 00:23:36,289
It's very remiss of you
to neglect your sovereign for so long.

307
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:42,295
Yes, Your Majesty.

308
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:46,161
Anyway, I want you
to do something for me.

309
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:50,876
- Your Grace!
- I need to speak to your master.

310
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:55,090
Alas, Your Grace, my master is in bed
with gout and in the greatest agony.

311
00:23:55,415 --> 00:23:58,018
No, no. Show His Grace in,
by all means.

312
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,396
Your Grace must forgive me.

313
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:08,896
Of course.

314
00:24:10,687 --> 00:24:12,492
I have brought something for you.

315
00:24:13,178 --> 00:24:15,064
May I ask its import?

316
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,582
It contains the outlines
for a secret treaty between our masters.

317
00:24:20,147 --> 00:24:23,587
The recent seizures of English
merchant ships in the French ports,

318
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:26,506
and the French King's
new amity with the Turks

319
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:28,341
are the final straw.

320
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,679
King Henry promises
to support the Emperor

321
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,681
whenever he is called upon to do so.

322
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:39,236
He also pledges to invade France in
conjunction with the Emperor's armies.

323
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:54,910
Your Grace
could not have made me happier

324
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,912
if you had brought me
a cure for gout!

325
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,425
I will make sure this is delivered
to the Emperor immediately

326
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:06,254
you can be sure that he will receive it
with the very greatest pleasure.

327
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:17,099
Your Majesty,

328
00:25:17,486 --> 00:25:18,980
Lady Latimer is here.

329
00:25:38,742 --> 00:25:40,101
I wanted to assure you

330
00:25:40,494 --> 00:25:43,250
there is no suspicion
of treason against your husband,

331
00:25:43,895 --> 00:25:46,141
still less against
you and your family.

332
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:48,756
Thank you, Your Majesty.

333
00:25:50,638 --> 00:25:53,562
I know very well the cause
of the distress to Lord Latimer

334
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,303
during the late rebellion.

335
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:59,600
I also know that you
and your stepchildren

336
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,320
were very roughly handled
by the traitor Robert Aske.

337
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,815
You must have been very frightened,
My Lady.

338
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,804
Well, at the time, Sir,

339
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:10,992
I was more frightened
for my husband,

340
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,113
for his safety and his sanity.

341
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:20,646
I hear that Lord Latimer is unwell.

342
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,912
He is very ill indeed, Your Majesty

343
00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:26,585
and not likely to live long.

344
00:26:27,706 --> 00:26:29,337
You have no children by him?

345
00:26:30,544 --> 00:26:32,174
No, Your Majesty.

346
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:34,277
Nor by your first husband?

347
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
No.

348
00:26:38,561 --> 00:26:41,279
I was married at seventeen
to Edward Borough,

349
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:43,041
the son of Lord Borough.

350
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:45,672
But he died three years later.

351
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:48,457
I was told he was insane.

352
00:26:49,586 --> 00:26:50,636
Is it true?

353
00:26:53,718 --> 00:26:56,530
It was not a happy marriage,
Your Majesty.

354
00:27:00,148 --> 00:27:02,162
Do you think such a thing exists?

355
00:27:03,297 --> 00:27:04,297
Yes!

356
00:27:04,683 --> 00:27:07,818
I believe so
with all my heart and soul.

357
00:27:14,377 --> 00:27:16,468
Ah... please forgive me.

358
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,718
No, no.

359
00:27:18,822 --> 00:27:21,325
You are to be congratulated,
Lady Latimer,

360
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:23,509
for your...

361
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:26,478
eternal optimism.

362
00:27:36,663 --> 00:27:37,713
Your Grace,

363
00:27:38,775 --> 00:27:41,317
His Majesty has sent
these papers for your attention.

364
00:27:41,484 --> 00:27:42,918
Thank you, Mr. Risley.

365
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:44,955
Mr. Risley,

366
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:47,879
you know I'm sure

367
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,443
that the King has made a
secret treaty with the Emperor,

368
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,600
the great champion of Catholicism!

369
00:27:54,057 --> 00:27:56,758
Well, as a result, I see no reason
why we should not start

370
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,139
hunting down all the Lutherans

371
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:01,771
and Evangelicals
in His Majesty's Kingdom.

372
00:28:02,672 --> 00:28:04,314
Do you think there are many such?

373
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:05,761
I know it!

374
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:07,721
They breed like rats.

375
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:11,439
They spread the vile disease
of their heresy everywhere!

376
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:14,103
Some of them, even now,

377
00:28:15,468 --> 00:28:17,318
are very close to the King.

378
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:22,669
And...

379
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:24,869
we should flush them out?

380
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:26,575
Exactly.

381
00:28:26,963 --> 00:28:29,223
And set them
on the pyres at Smithfield.

382
00:28:30,886 --> 00:28:33,160
Don't you agree, Mr. Risley?

383
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:53,523
Parcels, sweetheart?

384
00:28:55,095 --> 00:28:56,095
Who from?

385
00:28:56,414 --> 00:28:57,614
From the King.

386
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,863
The King?

387
00:29:00,453 --> 00:29:01,933
Parcels from the King?

388
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,324
Are you not going to open them?

389
00:29:06,128 --> 00:29:07,878
- Yes.
- Open them then.

390
00:29:13,595 --> 00:29:14,711
What are they?

391
00:29:16,316 --> 00:29:18,374
Pleats... and sleeves.

392
00:29:19,144 --> 00:29:20,244
For dresses.

393
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:23,268
Let me look.

394
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:33,052
- Are they fashionable?
- Yes.

395
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,525
Why should the King
send you presents?

396
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:43,620
I don't know. I think
that I should return them.

397
00:29:44,881 --> 00:29:47,535
You cannot return
presents to the King.

398
00:29:48,396 --> 00:29:49,795
You must acknowledge them.

399
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:53,166
I don't know why he has sent them.

400
00:29:54,996 --> 00:29:56,718
Yes you do, my love.

401
00:29:59,461 --> 00:30:00,511
Yes you do.

402
00:30:06,854 --> 00:30:09,104
I feel as though I am dead already.

403
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:17,055
I call upon His Gracious Majesty,

404
00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:19,126
King Henry VIII,

405
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:23,352
to pledge before God
and these witnesses

406
00:30:23,852 --> 00:30:26,677
to honor this new Treaty
between His Majesty

407
00:30:27,163 --> 00:30:28,899
and King Charles V,

408
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:31,275
the Holy Roman Emperor.

409
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,625
This treaty of mutual assurance

410
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:38,670
contains within it an obligation

411
00:30:39,418 --> 00:30:41,881
to undertake a war against France

412
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,046
within two years of this date,

413
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:45,972
to which His Majesty

414
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,681
agrees to send 40,000 men-at-arms

415
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,281
for that purpose.

416
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,610
Your Majesty,

417
00:30:55,886 --> 00:30:57,540
do you pledge to honor

418
00:30:58,081 --> 00:31:00,233
all the terms of this new treaty?

419
00:31:00,783 --> 00:31:02,501
I do, so help me God.

420
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:05,689
- Will you sign the Treaty?
- I will.

421
00:31:45,597 --> 00:31:46,597
Finally.

422
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:49,387
Your men shall see France.

423
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:57,707
So Excellency,

424
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,880
is it true that a treaty
has been signed

425
00:32:00,047 --> 00:32:01,628
between His Majesty and the Emperor?

426
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:04,380
I don't understand.

427
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:07,799
What, but the design
of subjugating Christendom,

428
00:32:08,347 --> 00:32:11,845
could make a revengeful prince
like the Emperor forget the insult

429
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:15,089
done to him by the King of England,
in the person of his aunt?

430
00:32:16,129 --> 00:32:18,949
Those insults are long forgotten,
Monsieur Marillac.

431
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:21,582
You don't deny then,
that your master plan is

432
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:23,525
to subjugate
the whole of Christendom?

433
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:25,011
I do deny it.

434
00:32:25,562 --> 00:32:28,159
I believe those ambitions
are held by the Turks,

435
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:31,375
with whom your own master
is in alliance!

436
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,766
- Excellency!
- Your Grace.

437
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:38,356
May I present you with a formal
intimation of war against your country.

438
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,483
Lady Latimer is here, Sir Thomas.

439
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:07,110
My God, look at you!

440
00:33:07,981 --> 00:33:09,501
You look so very beautiful.

441
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:13,783
What is it?

442
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:18,246
This dress was a gift.

443
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:20,951
A gift?

444
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:24,352
- From whom?
- From the King.

445
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:30,834
When did the King start
sending you presents?

446
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:32,001
Recently.

447
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:33,845
I gave him no cause!

448
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,179
No. Of course not.

449
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:38,224
How could you?

450
00:33:38,989 --> 00:33:41,019
You do believe me, don't you?

451
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:43,779
Please say that you believe me.

452
00:33:44,144 --> 00:33:45,898
Thomas, I love you.

453
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:48,909
I never sought these advances
from the King,

454
00:33:49,076 --> 00:33:50,945
do not welcome them.

455
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:53,948
You would not...

456
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:56,906
- like to be Queen of England?
- No!

457
00:33:57,463 --> 00:34:00,261
For heaven's sake! You know
what happens to his Queens!

458
00:34:00,428 --> 00:34:02,328
Everyone knows what happens.

459
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:07,727
I'm afraid.

460
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,010
Well, don't be.

461
00:34:12,072 --> 00:34:15,678
He's just a lonely man
that has set his cap at you.

462
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:18,098
I hope so.

463
00:34:23,477 --> 00:34:26,022
Your Majesty should know
that the Regent Queen of Scotland

464
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,149
has given permission
for negotiations to begin

465
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,169
regarding a marriage contract

466
00:34:30,336 --> 00:34:33,312
between her daughter Mary,
soon to be Queen of Scots,

467
00:34:33,747 --> 00:34:36,115
and your son, Prince Edward.

468
00:34:36,943 --> 00:34:40,088
After the negotiations are complete,
a treaty will be signed,

469
00:34:40,255 --> 00:34:42,997
uniting through marriage
the English and Scottish thrones

470
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:45,301
as Your Majesty so desires.

471
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:48,626
It seems our Noble Scottish lords
did as we bid them.

472
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:52,243
Majesty, with an infant Queen,
a quarrelsome nobility,

473
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,518
and a lack of French support,

474
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:57,595
- what choice do the Scots have?
- I agree.

475
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,696
I ask you to expedite negotiations

476
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:01,777
and not let this opportunity pass.

477
00:35:02,512 --> 00:35:04,393
I don't always trust the Scots.

478
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:08,732
Your Grace, you tabled an item?

479
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,015
Your Majesty,

480
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,441
I regret to have to inform you

481
00:35:12,843 --> 00:35:16,394
that we have discovered
a nest of heretics

482
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:19,325
at the very heart
of Your Majesty's household.

483
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:23,830
Of whom do you speak?

484
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,768
The musicians of the Royal Chapel.

485
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,670
All of them?

486
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:34,975
The Master of Choristers,
John Marbeck,

487
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:37,719
stands accused of being
a secret Calvinist.

488
00:35:38,473 --> 00:35:40,179
Also, the Organist,

489
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,112
Robert Testwood and Edmund Harman,

490
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,771
a singing man.

491
00:35:46,986 --> 00:35:48,646
Do we have permission

492
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,184
to arrest and examine these men?

493
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:01,294
Your Grace, I give you license.

494
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:05,401
I will have no Evangelicals
or traitors in this household.

495
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,930
And for those who wish
to alter or push my Reformation

496
00:36:09,097 --> 00:36:10,778
to the extremes, I say this:

497
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,184
there will be no alteration
to the Church of England

498
00:36:14,351 --> 00:36:15,882
as long as I live!

499
00:36:29,956 --> 00:36:32,364
John Marbeck. Robert Testwood!

500
00:36:32,846 --> 00:36:34,734
Edmund Harman! You are all

501
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,134
under arrest.

502
00:36:37,546 --> 00:36:38,546
Seize him!

503
00:36:40,429 --> 00:36:42,622
You should not have come here,
Mr. Testwood.

504
00:36:42,789 --> 00:36:44,600
My Lord, where else could I go?

505
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,783
Please help me.

506
00:36:47,368 --> 00:36:48,444
I beg of you.

507
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:51,412
There is nothing I can do,
without condemning myself,

508
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:53,063
and that I will not do.

509
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,350
You are only to be examined
by Gardiner.

510
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,604
If you answer him as he desires,

511
00:36:57,771 --> 00:36:59,926
- then what have you to fear?
- I fear, my Lady,

512
00:37:01,317 --> 00:37:04,431
that His Grace will then resort
to other means of persuasion,

513
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,744
since that is the way now.

514
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,984
Then you must be strong in
your faith, Mr. Testwood.

515
00:37:12,248 --> 00:37:14,723
We all know the day may come
when we have to walk

516
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,369
in the path of Christ.

517
00:37:16,854 --> 00:37:19,356
But if we are afraid,
if we turn away,

518
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:23,318
then we have no right to call
ourselves true Christians.

519
00:37:30,043 --> 00:37:32,575
If you so much as mention
my husband's name,

520
00:37:33,048 --> 00:37:36,667
I assure you that things will
go very badly with your family.

521
00:37:38,253 --> 00:37:39,598
Your sweet wife

522
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,341
and those two lovely children.

523
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:58,391
People tell me that you
have been unwell, Lady Mary.

524
00:37:58,797 --> 00:38:00,447
I trust not too unwell.

525
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:02,117
I thank you.

526
00:38:02,817 --> 00:38:06,247
The surgeons have bled me
once or twice, I think to be better.

527
00:38:06,552 --> 00:38:07,574
God willing.

528
00:38:08,112 --> 00:38:09,954
- Yes, God willing.
- My Lady.

529
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:13,830
Tell me what is happening in court.

530
00:38:13,997 --> 00:38:15,835
Is the King thinking
of marrying again?

531
00:38:16,205 --> 00:38:18,055
There is a new law enacted.

532
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:22,745
It requires that any lady
the King may marry must,

533
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,292
on pain of death,

534
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:27,269
disclose any charge
of sexual misconduct

535
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:29,747
that might be brought against her.

536
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:33,441
Frankly, my Lady,
this rather narrows the field.

537
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,945
The ladies at court are...

538
00:38:36,596 --> 00:38:37,551
how to say

539
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,401
not exactly known for their virtue.

540
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,783
I still think the King
will want to remarry.

541
00:38:45,353 --> 00:38:47,048
It is true he has a son,

542
00:38:47,215 --> 00:38:49,618
but he will need another son
to feel secure,

543
00:38:50,147 --> 00:38:52,743
- in case the first should die.
- You are right.

544
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,682
And yet, what woman on earth
would want to marry a King

545
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:57,673
who either puts his wives away

546
00:38:58,117 --> 00:38:59,193
or kills them?

547
00:39:03,865 --> 00:39:05,165
Master Testwood.

548
00:39:06,586 --> 00:39:08,892
Enough heretical material
was discovered

549
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:10,848
in your house to have you condemned

550
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:13,851
as a secret Calvinist.

551
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:17,422
However, I would fain save you,

552
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:21,025
but you must help me first.

553
00:39:22,082 --> 00:39:23,132
Just think.

554
00:39:24,721 --> 00:39:27,156
The pain you suffer now
will be as nothing

555
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:29,825
compared to the pains of the fire.

556
00:39:30,447 --> 00:39:32,047
And all because you...

557
00:39:32,654 --> 00:39:35,706
falsely, mistakenly, treacherously

558
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:37,707
shelter those above you.

559
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:40,574
If you will just confess to me
their names.

560
00:39:43,462 --> 00:39:45,515
There is an usher of the King's,

561
00:39:46,062 --> 00:39:49,129
Sir Philip Holby.
Is he one of your heretic circle?

562
00:39:49,411 --> 00:39:50,361
No.

563
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,175
Dr. Simon Heynes,
the Dean of Exeter?

564
00:39:53,513 --> 00:39:55,946
You sang for him once, I think?

565
00:39:57,257 --> 00:39:59,605
Is he another
of your secret heretics?

566
00:40:01,052 --> 00:40:04,200
And what of the Earl of Hertford?

567
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:08,801
You give me the Earl of Hertford,

568
00:40:10,426 --> 00:40:12,726
and I will give you back your life.

569
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:15,905
An excellent plan, Your Majesty.

570
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:19,165
Of all the hook stories,
this is my favorite.

571
00:40:19,332 --> 00:40:21,195
- Do you agree?
- Indeed.

572
00:40:22,622 --> 00:40:24,694
How is your husband, Lady Latimer?

573
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,407
I'm afraid he has taken to his bed,
Your Majesty,

574
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:31,400
and lately made his will.

575
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:35,057
I am very sorry to hear that.

576
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:42,478
I must thank Your Majesty
for this beautiful dress,

577
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,814
and your other generous gifts,

578
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:46,861
of which
I have done nothing to deserve.

579
00:40:48,484 --> 00:40:50,271
You looked very sad, my Lady.

580
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:53,993
I am sure your recent life has
been difficult for you.

581
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:58,815
I wanted to give you something
to give you good cheer.

582
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:00,791
I wanted to see you smile.

583
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,102
There.

584
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:07,256
We will soon be at war with France.

585
00:41:07,604 --> 00:41:09,107
How is it, My Lord Suffolk?

586
00:41:10,145 --> 00:41:12,386
- It cannot come soon enough for me.
- I agree.

587
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:14,972
The war will be a chance for us
to exceed

588
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,807
even the glories of Henry V

589
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,154
at Azincourt.

590
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:22,133
- And you, My Lord Surrey?
- Majesty, my kind always

591
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,635
desires the honor of the field.

592
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,088
And what better field than France?

593
00:41:28,558 --> 00:41:29,487
Aye.

594
00:41:32,627 --> 00:41:34,727
Do you play cards, Lady Latimer?

595
00:41:35,722 --> 00:41:38,023
Yes, Your Majesty. I do.

596
00:41:39,752 --> 00:41:40,752
Good.

597
00:41:43,548 --> 00:41:46,003
The King seems quite taken
with Lady Latimer.

598
00:41:46,698 --> 00:41:47,698
It's true.

599
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:51,522
And we know that when he takes
a fancy to a person or a thing,

600
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:53,469
he usually goes the whole way.

601
00:41:53,936 --> 00:41:56,186
Perhaps that is why he's so happy.

602
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:04,324
My Lord,

603
00:42:06,715 --> 00:42:08,901
what happened to those musicians
who were arrested?

604
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:11,088
Gardiner examined them.

605
00:42:11,255 --> 00:42:13,156
He was not satisfied
with their answers,

606
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:15,532
all three have been transferred
to the Tower.

607
00:42:17,543 --> 00:42:19,790
May I ask why Your Grace is curious?

608
00:42:20,701 --> 00:42:22,302
Yes. You may ask.

609
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,957
Excuse me, brother.

610
00:42:42,536 --> 00:42:43,894
Your hand, my Lady.

611
00:42:46,372 --> 00:42:47,610
Your prize.

612
00:42:50,342 --> 00:42:52,253
- No, Your Majesty.
- Please.

613
00:42:52,549 --> 00:42:54,472
Your Majesty, I couldn't.

614
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,940
Look inside.

615
00:43:15,481 --> 00:43:16,481
Majesty,

616
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,364
although I am so touched,

617
00:43:20,178 --> 00:43:21,378
and flattered,

618
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,935
I cannot accept this ring.

619
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,185
Please...

620
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:28,272
accept this for me.

621
00:43:50,887 --> 00:43:51,887
Thank you.

622
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:53,746
You're welcome.

623
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:06,852
I have news for you.

624
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,700
- Majesty?
- I'm sending you to Brussels,

625
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:13,484
on embassy to the court
of the Regent of the Netherlands.

626
00:44:14,743 --> 00:44:16,478
Does it please you, Sir Thomas?

627
00:44:16,645 --> 00:44:17,645
I'm...

628
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:21,996
I'm very grateful to Your Majesty.

629
00:44:22,923 --> 00:44:23,923
Good.

630
00:44:49,263 --> 00:44:51,438
Is Your Majesty considering
another marriage?

631
00:44:53,146 --> 00:44:54,155
Perhaps.

632
00:44:55,045 --> 00:44:57,445
- And a war in France?
- For certain.

633
00:45:02,816 --> 00:45:05,292
- Do you really want to fight again?
- Yes.

634
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:07,241
Don't you?

635
00:45:07,776 --> 00:45:09,027
I thought you did.

636
00:45:10,762 --> 00:45:13,062
- ... take another wife?
- Yes.

637
00:45:14,956 --> 00:45:16,369
Am I not still able?

638
00:45:17,237 --> 00:45:20,075
To have a wife?
To have more children?

639
00:45:22,124 --> 00:45:23,307
To be myself?

640
00:45:31,144 --> 00:45:33,921
<i>Requiem aeternum dona es Domine,</i>

641
00:45:34,728 --> 00:45:37,809
<i>et Lux perpetua Au luceat.</i>

642
00:45:48,161 --> 00:45:50,717
John, I need to say
something to you.

643
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,550
Go to hell...

644
00:46:12,096 --> 00:46:16,030
<i>In nomine Patris et Filii et
Spiritus Sancti. Amen.</i>

645
00:47:04,576 --> 00:47:05,737
Catherine Parr,

646
00:47:06,244 --> 00:47:08,826
we are sent here
by the King's Majesty to offer you,

647
00:47:10,543 --> 00:47:13,745
after your days of mourning
for your late husband are complete,

648
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,968
his Majesty's hand in marriage.

649
00:47:18,063 --> 00:47:21,519
His Majesty esteems you
above all other women in his kingdom

650
00:47:22,015 --> 00:47:25,265
and hopes to find you well disposed
towards his offer,

651
00:47:25,736 --> 00:47:28,986
in which case he will be
the happiest man in England,

652
00:47:29,938 --> 00:47:31,788
and you the happiest woman.
