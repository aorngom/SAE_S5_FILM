1
00:00:20,897 --> 00:00:22,633
Do you know how unusual this is

2
00:00:22,776 --> 00:00:23,810
to be here,

3
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:26,371
take these very steps.

4
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:30,656
One is usually only fortunate enough
to encounter history in his past tense.

5
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:32,657
A visit to ancient ruins.

6
00:00:32,864 --> 00:00:35,098
Battlefields won and lost.

7
00:00:35,842 --> 00:00:37,370
But to see it in advance,

8
00:00:38,657 --> 00:00:41,354
to know that this place
in which you now stand

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,306
will become one
of monumental history.

10
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:46,540
And to know that your hand

11
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:49,194
will scratch out
the old world narrative.

12
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,202
Find a new one.

13
00:00:52,044 --> 00:00:54,338
A end of a ***.

14
00:00:54,498 --> 00:00:56,292
One of the mere infected

15
00:00:56,486 --> 00:01:01,272
finally rising up against those
who keep us eternally
benath their feet.

16
00:01:02,598 --> 00:01:06,210
And to know, it'll be your hand
that takes the favorite sword of Chthon.

17
00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:08,420
The very symbol of their oppressive rule.

18
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:10,192
And uses it against them.

19
00:01:13,768 --> 00:01:15,283
Or will.

20
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:19,412
With you right there by my side.

21
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:21,800
Is that where you want me?

22
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:24,562
Just as the first moment
we met.

23
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:25,732
You're sure?

24
00:01:25,926 --> 00:01:28,982
I seem you to remember
the moment we met,
I was trying to kill you.

25
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:30,812
And I was intended upon having you.

26
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:32,620
Funny how things work out.

27
00:01:32,907 --> 00:01:35,240
It does find a way, doesn't it?

28
00:01:38,376 --> 00:01:39,873
It's all ready Marcus.

29
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:43,322
Everything installed,
your exact specifications.

30
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:44,802
New ventilation interface,

31
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:46,232
down in the security room,

32
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:49,950
large board duct,
with the AC system, and...

33
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:54,672
every door now requires laser
confirmation by retinal identity.

34
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:58,222
Identity confirmed.
Tucker Morfit.

35
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:00,952
What did I tell you?

36
00:02:01,095 --> 00:02:03,062
- I'm good.
- Yes, you are.

37
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,810
I do apologize for
my outburst the other day.

38
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:09,140
Marcus, I'm just glad it wasn't
me you made your point on.

39
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:10,721
But I'm done with him, right?

40
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,491
His last task is
to show you out.

41
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:14,550
Have a safe trip on Tucker.

42
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,882
Your well deserved reward awaits you.

43
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:19,150
Until our next masterpiece.

44
00:02:23,118 --> 00:02:24,920
It's all happening.

45
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:28,153
Everything you've worked so hard for,
is finally going to pay off.

46
00:02:28,288 --> 00:02:30,370
Actually one last problem remains.

47
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:32,681
The same one 
we always had it seems.

48
00:02:32,797 --> 00:02:34,463
Blade.

49
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:36,581
What about him?

50
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:39,871
He has a habit of showing up
when least expected.

51
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:41,842
I thought Chthon would do
the same to him.

52
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:42,950
So,

53
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:45,123
where do we find him?

54
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:46,941
That's the best part.

55
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:49,371
I already have.

56
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:17,421
Blade The Series - 112 - Conclave

57
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:24,723
Blade?

58
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:26,492
Would you just sit tight?

59
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:30,071
I don't do that very well.

60
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:34,960
You said you wanted Marcus' plans
to be happening and they're happening.

61
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:38,952
I'm supposed to have
faith in him?

62
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:42,033
No, not in him, in Krista.

63
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:43,981
It's exactly why
you recruited her.

64
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:45,991
She can get in place
and we can't.

65
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:49,113
Or shouldn't if it screws
things up like right now.

66
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:50,943
So just chill.

67
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:53,372
She said she'd call
when the deed is done.

68
00:03:54,187 --> 00:03:55,943
Seeing is believing.

69
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:59,913
Ah, I diddn't see this coming.

70
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:01,610
Ok.

71
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,371
Got any idea how we're gonna
get into that building?

72
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:06,900
Krista said they got
security up the ass.

73
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,560
I know someone who has a key.

74
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:12,230
Who is it?

75
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:14,602
It's her.

76
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:16,263
Krista?

77
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:20,660
You got to get out, Marcus'
people are coming for you.

78
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:24,890
They're already here.

79
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:27,421
Can you hear me? Blade?

80
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:29,023
Krista?

81
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:30,361
We're about to land.

82
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:32,500
Hum, be there in a second.

83
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:45,343
I'll tell you one thing,

84
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:48,750
no vamps aren't coming here
with UV lights in this place.

85
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:52,400
Now we're screwed.

86
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,780
Now  while we're still breathing.

87
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:19,831
Now we're screwed.

88
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:22,181
Give it up, Daywalker!

89
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,053
Do it.

90
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:32,370
Blow it up!

91
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:41,723
Come on!

92
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:44,253
Shit! I'm trying!

93
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:51,952
Your boyfriend's dead.

94
00:06:52,138 --> 00:06:53,683
Guess you'll have to do.

95
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:40,530
What are you doing?

96
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:42,280
Toying with you.

97
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,972
Are you enjoying this, Chase?

98
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:18,070
Have you met our guest before?

99
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:21,981
Shen Lu-Wei,

100
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,741
Blade's weaponsmith ,
sidekick, ***,

101
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:26,633
take your pick.

102
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:29,831
If you think you can use
me as leverage.

103
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:31,391
We don't need you as leverage.

104
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:32,793
Blade is dead.

105
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:34,593
Have you found the body?

106
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:37,020
*** error on the man,

107
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:39,550
they don't have dick.

108
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:43,113
Assuming you're right, then you
represent nothing more than

109
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:44,820
a liability right now.

110
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:48,903
Blade wouldn't dream of compromising
his jihad in order to rescue you.

111
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:50,871
So why am I still alive?

112
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:52,630
Because you got knowledge.

113
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:56,253
They are operations that
still remain in existence.

114
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:59,301
An underground network
of hunters you traffic with.

115
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:02,540
You have names,
locations, methodologies,

116
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:07,260
all kinds of informations we can
pry from your skull before we bleed you out.

117
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:11,510
I need you to leave for
Toronto immediately.

118
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:14,392
Only to oversee every
aspects of tonight's operation.

119
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,002
Is that understood?

120
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:35,343
Well, let's begin.

121
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:36,741
I'm sorry?

122
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:39,141
Coercing our friend here into talking.

123
00:09:39,286 --> 00:09:41,070
Choose use your poison.

124
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,142
Are  you meaning you
want me to...?

125
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:47,040
I presume you've encounted tortured
victims during your time in Iraq.

126
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:51,830
I'd imagine you have a fairly
extensive knowledge
of human pain thresholds.

127
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:15,482
Let me take care of this,

128
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:19,313
you've  got other business
to attend to, you should go.

129
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:21,092
There's time yet.

130
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,490
Enough for me to enjoy
a few more moments of this.

131
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:30,021
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,411
Just do it, you bloodsucking bitch.

133
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:36,873
Do it!!!

134
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,991
God!!!

135
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,341
If you don't start talking,

136
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:26,263
I'm gonna work on your teeth.

137
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:27,813
...

138
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:28,981
Good.

139
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,931
Maybe I'll start to hurt.

140
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:37,130
Krista?

141
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:39,360
I'm impressed.

142
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:43,551
Please, escalate.

143
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:47,961
My pleasure.

144
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:12,174
Sir, the plane is ready.

145
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:16,042
That's enough for now Krista.

146
00:13:16,444 --> 00:13:18,748
You'll finish when
we return from Toronto.

147
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:22,120
In the meantime our friend
can meditate on his own mortality.

148
00:13:23,156 --> 00:13:24,112
Come.

149
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:26,802
We have a revolution to start.

150
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:08,301
They totally destroyed the place.

151
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:09,790
Blade is dead.

152
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,650
Hey, we got the
little bitch of his.

153
00:14:15,497 --> 00:14:17,311
I know, I know, I know.

154
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:18,790
Shit!

155
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:43,632
Later.

156
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,173
Got any toilet paper?

157
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:12,833
I was just kidding about that though.

158
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:38,372
So,

159
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:41,622
you're my reward, aren't you?

160
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:44,312
Take your time, I don't mind.

161
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:47,072
You do whatever Marcus tells you,
don't you?

162
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:49,013
We all have to.

163
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:52,270
Can't be too safe though?

164
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:55,072
You're gonna need
more protection than that.

165
00:15:57,418 --> 00:15:58,441
Stay!

166
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,831
Wait, wait, wait!!! Ok, look!

167
00:16:01,946 --> 00:16:03,642
Ok, ok, look!

168
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:06,461
I'll tel what Marcus is planning.

169
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,513
I'll tell you
where Chthon is meeting.

170
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,920
I already know.

171
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:12,120
But then, what the hell
do you want?

172
00:16:15,096 --> 00:16:16,342
A way in.

173
00:16:18,598 --> 00:16:21,123
Don't worry, I only need one.

174
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:28,393
Damn...

175
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:31,060
What did you say?

176
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:35,241
I said, sun's up.

177
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:50,643
Damn it!

178
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:23,513
I'm here Marcus,

179
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:24,680
rest assured,

180
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:26,603
everything is proceeding
as planned.

181
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:46,912
I'll be taking over security.

182
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:47,790
Chase,

183
00:17:48,055 --> 00:17:49,401
I'm here on Marcus' orders.

184
00:17:49,608 --> 00:17:51,693
Yes, and Marcus ordered me
to replace you.

185
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:54,372
- I didn't hear anything about...
- Or did he say remove you?!

186
00:17:54,827 --> 00:17:56,363
Which would you prefer?

187
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:02,403
I'll go do the rounds.

188
00:18:03,587 --> 00:18:05,403
That's prudent.

189
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:17,782
Lovely.

190
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:20,321
All we need now is
the Pure Bloods,

191
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:22,240
and the games can begin.

192
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,402
- Are you infected?
- No.

193
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:56,190
You wearing a wire or
some shit like that?

194
00:18:56,337 --> 00:18:58,991
Not unless, they shoved it up
my ass when I wasn't looking.

195
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,881
Figured you were dead.

196
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:06,110
So did I,

197
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,013
until Krista slipped me
a little "pick me up".

198
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,873
Still can't believe you called.

199
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:14,722
One of us gets separated, it's every man for himself.

200
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:16,352
You know that.

201
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:19,071
Oh, I surprised you answered.

202
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:22,953
Now, are you gonna tell me
where you got this fine new ride?

203
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:28,932
Same place I got that.

204
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,632
- Their ETA?
- Five minutes.

205
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:48,380
Check on Chase.

206
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:49,860
Meet me upstairs.

207
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:15,550
Krista.

208
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:19,031
Get anything juicy
out of Blade's little helper?

209
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,332
Not yet.

210
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:22,431
Must not have squeezed hard enough.

211
00:20:23,027 --> 00:20:26,511
Sounds to me like another job
I'll be required to finish.

212
00:20:26,797 --> 00:20:29,272
Just get this one done first.

213
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:31,302
So that's it.

214
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:33,452
You came all this way
just to say that.

215
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:36,260
Do you roll over too?
Catch a ball.

216
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:37,352
You know Chase,

217
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:40,381
- you and I don't have to be like this.
- Too late, darling.

218
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:41,583
Now run along,

219
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:44,001
daddy will want you to fetch his sleepers.

220
00:21:21,357 --> 00:21:23,063
They're here, aren't they?

221
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,010
Just staying at the door.

222
00:21:26,107 --> 00:21:27,530
I can feel them.

223
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:29,072
Not for long.

224
00:21:35,268 --> 00:21:36,342
Van Sciver.

225
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:41,401
Overlord Rusk, it is an honor to
gain an audience with all of you.

226
00:21:41,628 --> 00:21:43,300
Almost all of us.

227
00:21:43,497 --> 00:21:44,571
Yes,

228
00:21:44,898 --> 00:21:47,940
Charlotte's passing came
as quite as surprise.

229
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:49,902
A terrible blow for Chthon.

230
00:21:50,135 --> 00:21:51,331
A sacrifice.

231
00:21:51,675 --> 00:21:55,443
But after tonight, one that will
not have been made in vain, yes?

232
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:58,062
I trust you've something
to present us?

233
00:21:58,258 --> 00:21:59,463
Indeed.

234
00:22:00,757 --> 00:22:02,971
We wait ***.

235
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:20,132
So,

236
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:22,682
what are we going in with?

237
00:22:22,886 --> 00:22:26,410
A sword, one UV blade
and two guns!

238
00:22:26,575 --> 00:22:27,460
And?

239
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:30,983
And that's it.

240
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:32,972
Great!

241
00:22:33,178 --> 00:22:36,752
Oh, and one of the guns
might not work.

242
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:38,770
Oh, I'll take the other one, then.

243
00:22:44,057 --> 00:22:45,660
Seriously bro,

244
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:48,312
what do you think our odds are?

245
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:50,600
Whatever they are.

246
00:22:51,425 --> 00:22:53,252
They're even worse for Krista.

247
00:22:53,468 --> 00:22:55,841
You actually care what happens to her?

248
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:59,203
I care because she's our way
into their world.

249
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:01,900
If she dies, Marcus goes with her.

250
00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:04,810
And everything we worked
for goes up in smoke.

251
00:23:05,015 --> 00:23:07,912
She got us tickets to
the Pure Blood ball.

252
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:10,930
If  Marcus survives, he gets upgraded.

253
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:12,573
So does Krista.

254
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:15,980
Then we move one notch up the
vampire foodchain, I get it.

255
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:17,690
You're just protecting our assets.

256
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:19,331
That's right.

257
00:23:19,617 --> 00:23:22,371
Anyone I ever tell you
you're a  *** son of a bitch.

258
00:23:24,396 --> 00:23:26,730
Every goddam day.

259
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,373
My fellow Pure Bloods,

260
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:34,451
we are the untainted.

261
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:36,170
The true.

262
00:23:36,526 --> 00:23:37,982
And after tonight,

263
00:23:38,245 --> 00:23:43,111
we will rule over even more
than the House of Chthon.

264
00:23:59,508 --> 00:24:03,592
I thank you all for accepting
my invitation to convene.

265
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:07,600
Conclave is a rare occurence.
Even for our House.

266
00:24:07,876 --> 00:24:09,680
The first among the Twelve.

267
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:13,591
And this is the time
of great sorrow.

268
00:24:14,377 --> 00:24:16,570
A voice is missing from our table.

269
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:19,681
Silenced by tragic circumstance.

270
00:24:19,915 --> 00:24:24,492
Nevertheless, I trust that
Charlotte joins us in spirit,
if not in form.

271
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:28,790
And this gathering accords
with our tradition.

272
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:32,901
We  meet only in times
of great urgency.

273
00:24:33,168 --> 00:24:36,451
First, in year one
of our calendar,

274
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:41,401
convened by Lord Chthon himself
when he took this sword in hand,

275
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:45,132
and ended the tyranny
of our gender.

276
00:24:45,556 --> 00:24:47,391
More recently,

277
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:51,121
we've met in
the ruins of Nagasaki.

278
00:24:51,966 --> 00:24:54,710
In the winning days of
the Second World War,

279
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:59,202
our kind made unprecedented
advances amids the disarray

280
00:24:59,357 --> 00:25:01,161
and dislocation.

281
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:12,662
Now we meet for
a different purpose.

282
00:25:12,795 --> 00:25:13,893
True,

283
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,520
they are many pressing issues
for our House,

284
00:25:16,795 --> 00:25:19,221
our eternal war against the humans.

285
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:22,341
Our recent hostilities
against the House of Erebus

286
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:27,691
and the returning pollution of
the Armayans back to the vampire nation.

287
00:25:27,947 --> 00:25:30,790
Don't forget the worst filth of all.

288
00:25:34,858 --> 00:25:36,310
Identity confirmed.

289
00:25:36,545 --> 00:25:38,631
Tucker Morfit.

290
00:25:42,047 --> 00:25:43,433
After tonight,

291
00:25:43,827 --> 00:25:47,083
Blade will no longer be
a factor in the great game.

292
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:48,712
How can you be so sure?

293
00:25:49,018 --> 00:25:50,581
Because tonight,

294
00:25:51,145 --> 00:25:54,021
we all become daywalkers.

295
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:55,523
Tonight,

296
00:25:55,735 --> 00:25:58,081
we take possession of a weapon

297
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:01,473
that will ciment our domination
of the other Houses.

298
00:26:01,587 --> 00:26:02,513
The fruit

299
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:06,451
of Charlotte's final project
begun nearly a decade ago

300
00:26:06,785 --> 00:26:10,671
finally birthed then brought
to us from beyond her grave :

301
00:26:11,156 --> 00:26:13,102
Aurora.

302
00:26:18,555 --> 00:26:20,111
Your prop.

303
00:26:21,636 --> 00:26:23,060
To my final performance.

304
00:26:30,115 --> 00:26:31,802
Everything ready on the ***?

305
00:26:32,786 --> 00:26:33,983
Perfectly.

306
00:26:34,846 --> 00:26:35,872
Yours?

307
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,900
Poison in place.

308
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:39,330
Awaiting your touch.

309
00:26:45,358 --> 00:26:47,971
In a very short while,

310
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:51,092
the three of us will leave that
room upstairs and with it

311
00:26:51,306 --> 00:26:52,902
the old House of Chthon.

312
00:26:53,527 --> 00:26:56,803
Now I know that your relationship
has had its difficulties.

313
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:59,722
I just hope all that
can be put behind us.

314
00:26:59,938 --> 00:27:03,140
Because we are about
to walk into a new world.

315
00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:05,672
And there is just simply no one,

316
00:27:05,907 --> 00:27:08,593
I would rather take those
first few steps with.

317
00:27:08,787 --> 00:27:10,553
And the two of you...

318
00:27:14,186 --> 00:27:15,223
Sir?

319
00:27:15,596 --> 00:27:17,732
The Overlord is ready for you.

320
00:27:18,905 --> 00:27:21,020
And so will I to ***.

321
00:27:39,035 --> 00:27:41,052
What's he doing back in here?

322
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:44,621
Van Sciver asked to make
the presentation in
Charlotte's absence.

323
00:27:44,785 --> 00:27:46,070
He's a turned blood.

324
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:48,281
Under the circumstances, I'm...

325
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:50,212
willing to make an exception.

326
00:27:50,355 --> 00:27:51,823
Just this once.

327
00:27:53,287 --> 00:27:54,991
Thank you, Lord Rusk.

328
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,200
And I thank all of you
for your indulgence.

329
00:27:57,448 --> 00:28:00,720
I am honored to have had
the opportunity to prepare
this site for this...

330
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:02,963
Oh, get on with it, Van Sciver.

331
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:07,732
We’re far too old to be moved
by your honey-voiced ass-kissing.

332
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:10,250
And remember,

333
00:28:10,495 --> 00:28:12,523
you might have built this room.

334
00:28:12,705 --> 00:28:16,323
But that doesn't mean a turned blood
like you belongs here.

335
00:28:16,468 --> 00:28:17,820
Or ever will.

336
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,463
Of course.

337
00:28:20,747 --> 00:28:23,872
But I assure you I come bearing
a magnificient gift.

338
00:28:24,345 --> 00:28:26,421
The gift of a new dawn
for our House.

339
00:28:26,616 --> 00:28:28,120
A real dawn.

340
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:32,993
One that will allow each and every
one of you to experience things
that you never have before.

341
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:36,031
To be what you never have been.

342
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:43,362
Kill 'em all.

343
00:28:43,846 --> 00:28:45,011
Familiars too.

344
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,221
I was hoping for something
more specific.

345
00:28:47,637 --> 00:28:50,842
The security room is
like *** poison gaz.

346
00:28:51,027 --> 00:28:54,021
- We'll start there and work our way up.
- And when we get to the top?

347
00:28:54,177 --> 00:28:56,061
Kill more vampires.

348
00:29:00,856 --> 00:29:05,393
I'm  awarr some of you had doubts when
Charlotte presented my proposal
for Aurora's development.

349
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:06,851
And it did take many years,

350
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,771
and many millions of dollars to perfect.

351
00:29:09,978 --> 00:29:12,891
But what I bring tonight is
a prize unlike anything our House

352
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:14,712
or any other Houses has ever seen.

353
00:29:14,945 --> 00:29:16,383
Enough theater Marcus,

354
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:19,891
just give us what
you came to give us.

355
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,952
Happily.

356
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:28,140
The vaccine you've
all been expecting.

357
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:35,760
The magical cure that will conquer
our genetic weakness to garlic,
silver and sunlight.

358
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:42,730
It never worked.

359
00:29:45,055 --> 00:29:46,491
But don't worry.

360
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:49,753
I've come to deliver
what you really deserve.

361
00:30:15,707 --> 00:30:17,042
Shit!

362
00:30:22,925 --> 00:30:25,321
Well done, Marcus, well done!

363
00:30:25,598 --> 00:30:31,952
You almost had me actually believing
that Aurora wasn't the lie that
you've been selling all this time.

364
00:30:32,135 --> 00:30:35,671
The same lie that forced you
to blow up Charlotte's plane.

365
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:41,050
Friends,

366
00:30:41,947 --> 00:30:46,230
I apologize for not informing
you of this subterfuge sooner.

367
00:30:46,418 --> 00:30:50,643
We thought it was important
that Marcus revealed himself.

368
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:51,831
We?

369
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:53,363
We!

370
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:57,073
Chase!

371
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:01,513
Charlotte gave me
a simple choice, Marcus.

372
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:04,500
You or the House of Chthon.

373
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:06,410
And as much as I've grown
to care for you,

374
00:31:06,648 --> 00:31:09,651
I decided it was more prudent
to bet on the House.

375
00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:11,373
After everything I gave to you.

376
00:31:11,655 --> 00:31:13,602
And everything you didn't.

377
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:16,040
Chase!

378
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:18,162
Chase, no.

379
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:22,110
Marcus belongs to us.

380
00:31:35,486 --> 00:31:36,860
The vents are screwed.

381
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:39,152
There's no delivery system
for the poison.

382
00:31:39,306 --> 00:31:42,260
Yes, there is, me.

383
00:31:42,765 --> 00:31:44,462
Get the other two working.

384
00:31:44,677 --> 00:31:46,480
And then get your ass up there.

385
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:51,690
What a delightful
way top end the evening?

386
00:31:51,858 --> 00:31:54,312
Drinking the blood of a traitor.

387
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:57,833
After you've watched him die,
you belong to me.

388
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:07,431
Can't have a party without a keg.

389
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:43,853
Screw this!

390
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:47,250
Just stay cool pal,
and no one dies.

391
00:33:47,476 --> 00:33:49,512
I forgot the one
that doesn't work.

392
00:34:23,697 --> 00:34:26,620
I should have let him kill you, Van Sciver.

393
00:34:27,336 --> 00:34:29,260
It's nice to meet you too, Blade.

394
00:34:54,368 --> 00:34:56,633
Who belongs to who now, bitch!

395
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:43,251
Shit!

396
00:35:43,536 --> 00:35:44,681
Damn it!

397
00:35:48,786 --> 00:35:50,281
Identity confirmed.

398
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:21,923
Is it about a man, Chase?

399
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:23,610
You're such a girl!

400
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:25,901
This isn't about Marcus.

401
00:36:26,807 --> 00:36:29,213
This is about me moving up
in the world.

402
00:36:29,496 --> 00:36:30,561
Sorry, sweetie!

403
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:40,023
I only see you going down!

404
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,952
That's the relic of Chthon?

405
00:37:30,176 --> 00:37:32,620
Why am I not surprised
it's a piece of shit!

406
00:37:41,018 --> 00:37:42,260
Blade!

407
00:37:48,955 --> 00:37:51,551
Your death will make
this night complete.

408
00:37:57,118 --> 00:37:58,220
Krista!

409
00:38:07,276 --> 00:38:08,523
Shen!

410
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:15,091
Don't try to tell me
that was a win.

411
00:38:15,636 --> 00:38:17,461
Pure Bloods dead is a win.

412
00:38:17,946 --> 00:38:20,342
Marcus further up the ladder is a win.

413
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:21,773
Krista still with him...

414
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:24,451
- is a win.
- Yeah, yeah, for how long?!

415
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:27,521
- Because you know the deeper
she goes!
- She can handle it.

416
00:38:31,385 --> 00:38:33,852
Anyone ever tell you you're
an optimistic son of a bitch.

417
00:38:35,907 --> 00:38:37,701
Every goddam day!

418
00:39:07,718 --> 00:39:09,250
Marcus, what are we doing here?

419
00:39:09,496 --> 00:39:11,160
Just tying up loose ends.

420
00:39:11,356 --> 00:39:13,742
Blade was a thorn in my sight
for quite some time.

421
00:39:14,106 --> 00:39:16,660
It caused to people considerable
troubles over the years.

422
00:39:17,718 --> 00:39:19,092
And now he's gone.

423
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:21,031
For now.

424
00:39:21,857 --> 00:39:25,373
They're going underground, eventually
re-emerge in some other city.

425
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:27,842
Won't you have to do the same?

426
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,550
I mean, the Pure Bloods
are gonna be looking for you now.

427
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:31,942
No doubt,

428
00:39:32,477 --> 00:39:34,130
but they'll have to be cautious.

429
00:39:34,398 --> 00:39:36,212
I have the great equalizer.

430
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:41,660
The weapon which targets the royal
blood but yet leaves the rest of us
turned safe and sound.

431
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:44,023
The atom bomb is at my disposal.

432
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,781
They'll have no choice
but to acceed to my demands.

433
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:49,210
Which are what?

434
00:39:49,356 --> 00:39:51,331
Rule Chthon, first of all.

435
00:39:51,537 --> 00:39:53,293
The entire House.

436
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,310
Never in the history of our people
has a turned blood been able to top it all.

437
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:59,200
Now one is.

438
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:00,690
I promise you,

439
00:40:00,846 --> 00:40:03,620
things will be very different
from here on out.

440
00:40:03,865 --> 00:40:05,603
Especially now that
Chase is dead.

441
00:40:05,757 --> 00:40:07,061
We don't know that for certain.

442
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,590
Come on Marcus,
I saw her drop a dozen storeys.

443
00:40:09,736 --> 00:40:11,101
Even if I saw her ash!

444
00:40:11,235 --> 00:40:12,943
Even if I had my hand
with her reminants.

445
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:16,511
I would still watch my back
for the rest of my years on earth!

446
00:40:20,165 --> 00:40:21,491
Can I ask you something?

447
00:40:23,225 --> 00:40:24,433
Anything.

448
00:40:26,146 --> 00:40:28,891
How did you find out where
Blade was operating from?

449
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:32,962
Who told you about
this location?

450
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:35,321
Blade

451
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:37,923
has a network of people
working with him.

452
00:40:38,085 --> 00:40:40,600
Informants, ashers,

453
00:40:40,777 --> 00:40:43,871
people who traffic
on both sides of the fence.

454
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:46,502
We were able to intercept
a phone call last week.

455
00:40:46,706 --> 00:40:47,960
We traced it.

456
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:49,691
Followed this person here.

457
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,322
The rest was simplicity.

458
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:57,120
Now I have a question for you.

459
00:41:00,448 --> 00:41:02,682
How long have you
been working for Blade?

460
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:08,381
