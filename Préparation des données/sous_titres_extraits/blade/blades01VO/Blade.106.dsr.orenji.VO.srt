1
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:11,113
Previously on Blade

2
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:14,696
From the dying ashes of one world,
we will emerge into better one.

3
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:16,657
You make it sound like apocalpyse.

4
00:00:16,818 --> 00:00:19,200
Destruction is always required
before rebirth.

5
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:22,894
Doctor Vonner? No!!!

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,393
People loved this guy.

7
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,105
After him we knew.

8
00:00:26,272 --> 00:00:28,001
- Well, she's cute.
- She's pregnant.

9
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:29,504
The question is...

10
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,073
with what?

11
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:35,238
Boone gets to Domic, tells him
we've been experimenting on his people.

12
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:39,544
Just the sort of thing, the House of
Armaya might need to turn this into
full scale war.

13
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:40,798
And if there is a war,

14
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:42,002
we will lose,

15
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:44,323
- unless Aurora works.
- It will work.

16
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:46,601
It'd damn well better.

17
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:49,310
- What is your business in Germany?
- Pleasure.

18
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:52,241
And to aid you in your travels.

19
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:54,891
I'm asking you for help.

20
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:58,241
And this must remain a secret.
Or the Pure Bloods will kill us all.

21
00:00:58,397 --> 00:01:00,950
- There's something wrong with my baby?
- Everything's fine.

22
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:12,001
You stay away from me!

23
00:01:53,508 --> 00:01:55,582
What is that?

24
00:01:57,048 --> 00:01:58,560
Dinner.

25
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:08,691
Please, let me go.

26
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:10,241
When it's time.

27
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:11,703
I'll scream.

28
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:13,181
I'll stop you.

29
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:21,493
What was all that back there?

30
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:27,591
Hello, I have a right to know
what's happening to me, damn it!

31
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:34,132
Let's discuss Doctor Vonner first.

32
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:36,612
Come on, what does he have to
do with any of this?

33
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:40,070
Did you kill him?

34
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:46,282
Is this about my baby?

35
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:52,271
Is my baby ok?

36
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:55,311
Vonner, what did he do to you?

37
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:58,803
I'm not telling you anything,
you freak.

38
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:05,030
That's it.

39
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:48,093
Blade The Series - 106 - Delivery

40
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:08,021
Let's get some to my wife.

41
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:43,172
Powerful isn't it?

42
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:46,953
Those bombs even sort of sounded
like that, if that makes any sense.

43
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,032
Yeah.

44
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:53,282
Who painted this?
There's no signature.

45
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:55,233
Our specialist Pete Allison.

46
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,843
We were in the 123rd bataillon
together near Doah.

47
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:02,943
After the bomb went off, when
everybody was yelling and screaming,

48
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:06,031
at home, it must
has been his lucky day.

49
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:11,110
A week after he painted this,
he hung himself.

50
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:14,693
He'd uh, he'd only
been home a month.

51
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:19,423
I think holding on this community
landmark is essential.

52
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:24,311
This building, before it became
a glass plant for early 20th century
automobiles was a blacksmith foundry.

53
00:05:25,897 --> 00:05:29,190
Turning it into a public art house 
instead of tearing it down

54
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:31,693
it's not only good for people,
it's good for the soul.

55
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:32,602
Sorry.

56
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:33,780
Hello?

57
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:36,662
Excuse me.

58
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:40,412
Where's the girl?

59
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,082
Track her down!

60
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:44,362
Let me talk to Chase.

61
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:47,893
Is she alive?

62
00:05:49,147 --> 00:05:49,902
When?

63
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,532
Have a full medical team ready.

64
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:03,390
- Uncle Pat!
- Buddy of mine thought 
he saw you here.

65
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:06,210
- I can't talk to you right now.
- Fine, I'll talk, you'll listen.

66
00:06:06,395 --> 00:06:08,863
Do you have any idea what
you're doing to your mother?

67
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:11,362
She's got a son who's dead and
a daughter who's vanished.

68
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:14,091
- God I'm not vanished!
- God knows what you're doing!

69
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:17,041
Showing up in the middle of the night,
telling her that you're avenging

70
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,491
- Zach's death or some kind of bullshit.
- No.

71
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:19,872
No, you got to get her help.

72
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:21,532
I've seen this before. You get back,

73
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:23,191
you think you're fine but you're not.

74
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:24,670
I know what you're going through.

75
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,942
You have absolutely no idea what
I'm going through.

76
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:28,351
Well, I know a couple of things.

77
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:30,033
That you're abandonning your family

78
00:06:30,247 --> 00:06:32,000
- and your mother needs 
you now more than ever!
- Mom is fine!

79
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:35,730
No she's not, she's not fine Krista,
she's sick!

80
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:37,451
What?

81
00:06:37,787 --> 00:06:40,303
She collapsed this morning.
I took her to the hospital.

82
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,231
- What's wrong with her?
- We don't know yet.

83
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:44,233
- Which hospital?
- Heaven View.

84
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:46,223
Krista! Gotta go.

85
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,222
Hold on, buddy, I'm talking to
my niece here.

86
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,642
Your niece?

87
00:06:49,836 --> 00:06:51,642
Pleased to meet you,
Marcus Van Sciver.

88
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:54,942
Now we would love to stay and chat,
but we just don't have the time.

89
00:06:55,788 --> 00:06:56,831
Krista?

90
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:42,882
Chase?

91
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:45,510
You are home now.

92
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,532
You are home.

93
00:07:55,696 --> 00:07:57,170
Blade.

94
00:07:58,217 --> 00:08:00,451
Blade? 
Yes I know.

95
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,592
There'll be time for him.

96
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:06,802
I want you in Berlin tonight.

97
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:08,290
What's in Berlin?

98
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:09,740
A young woman.

99
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:11,402
My property was stolen.

100
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,761
I want you to find her
and bring her back to me.

101
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:19,603
- Marcus...
- There is no discussion!

102
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:21,022
Go!

103
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:54,222
You know with
that baby coming...

104
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:57,163
Adams said I could get 
a few extra shift.

105
00:08:57,377 --> 00:08:59,593
You know what, 
you get that Joe's shift

106
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:02,393
because I'm telling you, the man just
drives the paychecks away.

107
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:03,723
Sassy!

108
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:05,482
So how long until dinner?

109
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:07,071
20 minutes!

110
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:10,290
Why don't you go watch 
Mannix or something?

111
00:09:10,478 --> 00:09:11,422
Ok.

112
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:13,721
Just gonna go finish up outside.

113
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,412
Ma?

114
00:09:29,957 --> 00:09:31,450
Hello, sweetie.

115
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:36,733
Now, you take those shoes off before
you track blood all over my floor.

116
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:47,623
You know, if I'd had known 
what a murderer son of a bitch 
you'd grow up to be.

117
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:49,533
I would have killed you in my room.

118
00:09:51,368 --> 00:09:54,761
Eric, you know what you got to do!

119
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,053
Gut the bitch!

120
00:10:00,956 --> 00:10:02,852
Let me show you how!

121
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,500
You always look at people like that?

122
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:19,842
Like what?

123
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:21,972
Like you want to kill them.

124
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:25,162
If I wanted you dead. 
You'd be.

125
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:28,002
Small mercies.

126
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:31,433
Don't count 'em just yet.

127
00:10:56,435 --> 00:10:58,480
Just excuse me 
for a second.

128
00:10:58,647 --> 00:10:59,581
H ey!

129
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:01,521
How is she doing?

130
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:03,072
She's asleep.

131
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:06,132
- They know what's wrong with her?
- Yeah.

132
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,661
Leuchimia.

133
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,823
Is she dying?

134
00:11:13,388 --> 00:11:17,953
Doctor Westler says with a bone marrow
transplant she's got a good chance.

135
00:11:18,268 --> 00:11:22,253
Of course, it's gotta come from
the family. I was no match.

136
00:11:22,427 --> 00:11:24,001
You're the only family left.

137
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:27,503
I can't do it.

138
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,892
- What do you mean?
- I mean I can't!

139
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:33,993
What's the problem?
Hepathitis?

140
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:35,862
Something worse?

141
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:41,211
Some goddamn junk?

142
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:43,602
You smoking it? 
Shooting it?

143
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:46,200
What's that Van Sciver punk
doing to you?

144
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:48,998
The Army will pay for a program,
Krista, you can get clean!

145
00:11:49,238 --> 00:11:52,904
- You don't get it.
- What's not to get it, you'd rather be
an addict than help your mom!

146
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:54,818
We're family Krista.

147
00:11:55,738 --> 00:11:57,560
- I'll be back.
- Krista!

148
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:25,383
What do you think it is?

149
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:28,761
My baby.

150
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:30,772
A girl or a boy?

151
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:34,562
No idea. 
And I don't care.

152
00:13:39,457 --> 00:13:41,011
Look, I need to go.

153
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:42,283
You're staying right here.

154
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:44,900
Then I'm pissing right here.

155
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,181
Hold it.

156
00:13:46,715 --> 00:13:48,803
Uh, yeah.

157
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:56,203
Well, how about you punch the pregnant
lady again and see what happens?

158
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,551
I think we need 
a new route to Paris.

159
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:03,132
- Any report from the hunters?
- They're working through Europe
city by city.

160
00:16:03,286 --> 00:16:04,603
There's no sign of Blade though.

161
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,131
And Jakob?

162
00:16:06,306 --> 00:16:08,390
Heading to Paris. He thinks that
Blade has a friend there.

163
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:11,842
Krista's on road to Berlin, send her
to Paris, tell Jakob to expect her.

164
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:12,802
Sir?

165
00:16:17,538 --> 00:16:18,493
How many?

166
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:19,890
Just her.

167
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:29,183
You're borrowing or returning?

168
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:32,893
Sit please.

169
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:39,452
There.

170
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:02,843
What's on my mind, Marcus?

171
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,560
- I'm sure I've no idea.
- Guess!

172
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:09,291
Berlin I assume.

173
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:11,380
And I can bet what's on yours.

174
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:13,632
Chase.

175
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:17,340
Roasted and marinating in blood
from what I hear.

176
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:20,120
She's recovering quite well.

177
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:23,391
And tell me why 
she was in Berlin.

178
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:27,652
What she was doing at the Malinger
Institute and why Blade showed up.

179
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:28,892
Let me add...

180
00:17:29,078 --> 00:17:32,411
do... not... lie!

181
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,371
Inspired by my previous 
assessment in Project Aurora,

182
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,522
Doctor Vonner's death 
has ended us somewh...

183
00:17:41,706 --> 00:17:43,121
Go on!

184
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:49,200
Chase was in Berlin protecting
an asset that was supposed
to further our progress.

185
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,613
The asset got taken.

186
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:52,050
By Blade?

187
00:17:52,348 --> 00:17:53,712
You have other assets?

188
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:56,181
18, in various locations.

189
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:59,373
Blade has only compromised this one,
the others are safe.

190
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:01,351
Where are they?

191
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:03,842
I'd rather not say.

192
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,633
- That information is limited
to keep the assets...
- Safe.

193
00:18:06,738 --> 00:18:07,583
Yes.

194
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:09,320
So many secrets.

195
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:13,990
I trust you of all people
who'd want it no other way.

196
00:18:14,418 --> 00:18:16,742
You may have to share 
those secrets.

197
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:18,372
With who?

198
00:18:18,608 --> 00:18:20,042
The House of Armaya.

199
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:22,620
Domic.

200
00:18:25,215 --> 00:18:27,302
He's requested a meeting.

201
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:30,270
He has certain informations
he would like to discuss.

202
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:32,080
To be more specific,

203
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:33,960
what he'd like to discuss 
are terms.

204
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:36,671
Terms?

205
00:18:36,895 --> 00:18:42,370
Could it be that Boone somehow
managed to spill the beans about our
slaughtering of Armayans for science?

206
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:43,771
Boone is dead.

207
00:18:43,978 --> 00:18:46,793
- Domic learnt nothing from him.
- He knows!

208
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,170
Is this really the best way?

209
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,551
Streets aren't safe.

210
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:09,490
You know I saved your ass from
those undead freaks back there.

211
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:11,731
The least you can do is to
answer some questions!

212
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:14,680
You first.

213
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:17,133
Start with Vonner.

214
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:24,903
I met him at a free clinic
that I go to for check-ups.

215
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:26,671
He said that I was 
a prime candidate,

216
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:29,431
young, healthy, 
good genetic history.

217
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,801
He told me there were 
this couple he knew.

218
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,893
Couldn't have kids.

219
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:35,961
I needed the money.

220
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:39,123
Screw you.

221
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:43,392
Look, I'm helping a couple that
can't have children become parents.

222
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:46,291
Think that was the idea.

223
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,771
Look I don't have anyone okay?

224
00:19:48,976 --> 00:19:51,792
It's just, it always has been,
doing what I have to do.

225
00:19:52,017 --> 00:19:55,022
I saw a way to pay some bills,
lose some debt.

226
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:58,552
What? What? Maybe I should
have been a stripper?

227
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,802
Doctor Vonner gave me
a better option. You know.

228
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:04,501
One that make people happy.

229
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:07,823
He lied.

230
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:13,430
Those undead freaks,
he worked for them.

231
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:14,632
They want what you have.

232
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:15,671
What?

233
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:17,583
My baby? Why?

234
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:19,381
That's what I'm going 
to find out.

235
00:20:19,556 --> 00:20:21,330
How? Where are we going?

236
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:23,772
To see a doctor, 
someone I trust.

237
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:26,292
- To make sure everything's ok?
- That's the idea.

238
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:10,216
Donne-moi 9 mois! 
Donnez 9 mois!

239
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:12,622
Allez-y!

240
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:15,053
Don't hit the pregnant lady.

241
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:31,801
Let's go.

242
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:23,072
What's wrong?

243
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:25,762
Is something wrong 
with my baby?

244
00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:28,381
No, no, no, no dear,
everything is fine.

245
00:22:29,136 --> 00:22:32,661
Yeah, just as I thought.
Perfectly healthy.

246
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,200
How is it?

247
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:37,450
Allow me to consult
with my associate.

248
00:22:52,947 --> 00:22:53,920
Movement.

249
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:55,271
We're going in.

250
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:57,593
Is it Blade and the girl?

251
00:22:57,846 --> 00:22:59,461
If it isn't, we'll wait for him.

252
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:01,823
Just so everyone understands.

253
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:04,313
The girl is secondary.

254
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:06,840
That's what she is carrying
that we are after.

255
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,570
That comes with us.

256
00:23:10,268 --> 00:23:11,552
Dead or alive.

257
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,480
Weapon check.

258
00:23:20,987 --> 00:23:24,321
Marcus tells me you're a vet. 
Recent?

259
00:23:24,997 --> 00:23:26,293
Very.

260
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:28,521
You?

261
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:31,003
I've served my country.

262
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:33,931
Several countries over
the past few years.

263
00:23:34,568 --> 00:23:35,850
Where was your first battle?

264
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,323
Gettysburg.

265
00:23:39,706 --> 00:23:40,723
No kidding?

266
00:23:41,276 --> 00:23:42,523
Blue or gray?

267
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:44,380
Both.

268
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:49,033
I found the food on both sides
of the line aqually tempting.

269
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:51,560
Whatt's your ammo?

270
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:53,231
Hallow point, silver-tipped.

271
00:23:53,426 --> 00:23:55,240
Silver has no effect on Blade.

272
00:23:55,757 --> 00:23:57,013
I know.

273
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:25,312
I don't know how to say this.

274
00:24:25,746 --> 00:24:27,503
- Vampire?
- No.

275
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:30,763
What am I looking at?

276
00:24:30,957 --> 00:24:32,061
Well, that's just it.

277
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:34,301
She's carrying
some kind of fluid.

278
00:24:34,478 --> 00:24:36,810
Uh, nothing else.

279
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:38,730
Let's see it.

280
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:44,092
- Vanessa, do you what 
an amniocentisis is?
- Yeah.

281
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,930
Uh, Doctor Vonner checked out
some fluid last week.

282
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:48,510
Everything was fine.

283
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:52,083
What's wrong?

284
00:24:52,255 --> 00:24:53,551
What's wrong with my baby?

285
00:25:03,396 --> 00:25:04,691
Who is it?

286
00:25:05,907 --> 00:25:06,962
Open it.

287
00:25:10,366 --> 00:25:11,342
Oh my god!

288
00:25:11,546 --> 00:25:12,320
Hi.

289
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:16,903
I'm here to kill you, kill Blade
and take the girl back to Marcus.

290
00:25:17,128 --> 00:25:19,221
Like that's ever gonna happen.

291
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:20,600
Bonjour.

292
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:21,892
Marcus sent you?

293
00:25:22,127 --> 00:25:23,743
Me and a team.

294
00:25:23,907 --> 00:25:24,783
Where are they?

295
00:25:25,718 --> 00:25:27,131
I had them first.

296
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,370
Excusez-moi, I need a drink.

297
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:32,221
Hello Vanessa.

298
00:25:32,736 --> 00:25:33,791
I know you.

299
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:35,552
You worked for Doctor Vonner.

300
00:25:35,725 --> 00:25:36,980
You're with the freaks.

301
00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:38,323
Not exactly.

302
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,970
I'm one.

303
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:18,673
Word of advice, Marcus.

304
00:26:19,086 --> 00:26:21,953
Don't speak to Domic
unless spoken to you.

305
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:24,081
You're not his favorite person
these days.

306
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:33,583
Charlotte!

307
00:26:35,117 --> 00:26:36,321
Domic!

308
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:39,071
Your protégé has done quite well
for himself.

309
00:26:39,696 --> 00:26:40,520
You know,

310
00:26:40,928 --> 00:26:43,670
back in the day, I used to be
in the gladiator business.

311
00:26:44,248 --> 00:26:46,762
Nothing like a good 
blood sport, yes?

312
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,322
What are we talking about?

313
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:53,860
Well, why don't we start with the vaccine,
you've been making with the blood 
of my people.

314
00:26:54,006 --> 00:26:56,940
What's the cute name Marcus
gave it? Aurora.

315
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:02,501
I can't imagine many tears
being shed over the demise of
a thousand or so Armayans.

316
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:08,981
Can you imagine what the reaction
will be when they'll learn that

317
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:12,651
the House of Chthon, the high
and mighty Chthon

318
00:27:12,816 --> 00:27:16,023
who styled themselves the leader
of the vampire nation,

319
00:27:16,277 --> 00:27:20,093
the tireless support for the peace
between the Twelve Houses

320
00:27:20,267 --> 00:27:22,700
has secretly been 
developping a vaccine

321
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:26,380
that would give them, 
and only them

322
00:27:26,617 --> 00:27:31,271
total superiority over the 
rest of their vampire brathering.

323
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,903
What do you want?

324
00:27:36,716 --> 00:27:37,571
In.

325
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,443
You want immunity?

326
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:41,900
Yes.

327
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:43,861
Immunity.

328
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:46,801
And amnesty.

329
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:53,161
It is time for our exile to come
to an end as well.

330
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,570
The House of Armaya demands
full inclusion back into the
governing body.

331
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:59,020
That's impossible!

332
00:27:59,247 --> 00:28:00,750
You tried to destroy us.

333
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:03,110
The folly of youth.

334
00:28:03,607 --> 00:28:06,941
You've been keeping the Houses
in line for over a hundred years.
They'll listen to you.

335
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:08,890
And what you are going to say,

336
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:12,862
is "we welcome back Armaya
with open arms

337
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:19,563
and Domic, Domic deserves his rightful
place along side his fellow
Pure Bloods."

338
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:22,813
Just to be clear,
this is blackmail.

339
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:24,521
It's justice!

340
00:28:24,738 --> 00:28:27,331
And in the events of
my untimely death

341
00:28:27,507 --> 00:28:30,651
I have certain document detailing
your transgrations against m...

342
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:32,780
- I get it!
- Good.

343
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,930
When would you like this done?

344
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:36,343
Within the week.

345
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:37,752
I'll need more time.

346
00:28:37,936 --> 00:28:39,932
You don't have it.

347
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:43,302
Armaya is back in 
the fold by Friday.

348
00:28:43,716 --> 00:28:45,651
Or by Saturday.

349
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:49,091
Chthon will be destroyed.

350
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:55,903
Domic!

351
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:04,622
How did you find out?

352
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:18,001
His name is Sands, 
luckily for me.

353
00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:20,462
He survived your funny games.

354
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,331
Mr Van Sciver, if I could just
say one thing.

355
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:29,211
Go to hell.

356
00:29:29,505 --> 00:29:30,861
All of you.

357
00:29:31,377 --> 00:29:34,291
Like life ain't hard enough,
we got you bastards

358
00:29:34,436 --> 00:29:38,693
pushing your goddamn chess pieces
all over the goddamn board!!!

359
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:43,570
Lost pawns are sick of it.

360
00:29:49,486 --> 00:29:50,970
You have my number.

361
00:30:07,748 --> 00:30:09,302
You know he won't stop.

362
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:13,000
He'll keep wanting more.

363
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:14,213
Yes.

364
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,033
Like someone else I know.

365
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,551
How are you doing?

366
00:30:57,846 --> 00:30:58,792
Sleepy.

367
00:30:59,896 --> 00:31:02,440
Just close your eyes,
it will be over soon.

368
00:31:06,306 --> 00:31:08,271
It wasn't supposed 
to be like this.

369
00:31:09,775 --> 00:31:11,103
I know.

370
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:14,633
I just wanted to have a baby.

371
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:22,083
What's inside me?

372
00:31:22,658 --> 00:31:24,192
I don't know, sweetheart.

373
00:31:24,406 --> 00:31:26,241
We're gonna get it out, ok?

374
00:31:26,438 --> 00:31:29,652
You... are going to feel a tug.

375
00:31:32,387 --> 00:31:33,321
Ok.

376
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:35,261
You're doing ok, you're doing ok.

377
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:39,692
It will be fine.

378
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,780
You're ok, you're ok.

379
00:31:55,986 --> 00:31:57,742
I wanna kill them,

380
00:31:58,065 --> 00:32:00,423
I wanna kill them for
what they've done!

381
00:32:00,577 --> 00:32:03,763
They're gonna pay, they will.

382
00:32:05,177 --> 00:32:06,711
They die too fast.

383
00:32:08,736 --> 00:32:10,421
They need to suffer.

384
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:11,990
I know.

385
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:21,350
Do you even feel pain?

386
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:25,180
I want them to feel pain for
what they've done!

387
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:28,171
We do.

388
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:39,541
My little man.

389
00:32:56,366 --> 00:32:59,153
Marcus had 
incubated something.

390
00:32:59,317 --> 00:33:02,603
Some sort of biological substance.

391
00:33:06,565 --> 00:33:07,581
Is she alright?

392
00:33:07,776 --> 00:33:09,202
She'll never have children.

393
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:12,571
I was forced to remove
compromised tissue, a lot of it.

394
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:15,052
I don't know what the long term
effects might be.

395
00:33:15,998 --> 00:33:17,173
She's sleeping.

396
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:19,150
What happens now?

397
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:24,080
I'll figure out what this is.

398
00:33:24,246 --> 00:33:27,322
Well, I gotta get this back to Marcus,
it's what he sent me here for.

399
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:28,452
Not all of it.

400
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,901
I need a sample.

401
00:33:31,517 --> 00:33:32,773
And Vanessa?

402
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:36,791
She goes underground.

403
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:40,650
Get her as far away from me
as possible.

404
00:33:42,015 --> 00:33:43,943
Blade, this isn't about Aurora.

405
00:33:44,335 --> 00:33:46,093
Marcus is up to something else.

406
00:33:46,245 --> 00:33:47,642
It could be even 
something worse,

407
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:49,572
- I don't know...
- Later.

408
00:33:58,707 --> 00:33:59,713
You know,

409
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:02,691
she has his mother's name.

410
00:34:24,387 --> 00:34:25,423
Is she ready?

411
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:26,520
One moment.

412
00:34:28,335 --> 00:34:29,530
It is time to go.

413
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:32,522
Don't be afraid, Vanessa.
You will be safe.

414
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,872
Where am I going?

415
00:34:34,027 --> 00:34:35,110
I don't know.

416
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,332
And you won't know to, until
you'll get there.

417
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:40,302
As far as anyone else is concerned,
you are dead.

418
00:34:40,337 --> 00:34:41,681
No one will come looking for you.

419
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:43,382
Come, you're free.

420
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:45,762
Like, I can't go home, ever.

421
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:47,980
No, no, no, you must very careful.

422
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:50,571
Many people have risked everything.

423
00:34:51,177 --> 00:34:55,792
To make sure you and others like
you remain hidden from them. Here!

424
00:34:57,966 --> 00:35:00,722
Tell them I said thank you,
tell them both.

425
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:03,081
If I see them again, yes.

426
00:35:03,286 --> 00:35:04,633
I will do so.

427
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:09,782
Au revoir.

428
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:21,663
I'm done, I can't do this anymore.

429
00:35:21,818 --> 00:35:22,923
I want out.

430
00:35:23,116 --> 00:35:24,952
We're doing a good thing here.

431
00:35:25,147 --> 00:35:27,130
I couldn't have done it without you.

432
00:35:27,268 --> 00:35:29,430
Yes, you could have,
you don't need me.

433
00:35:29,565 --> 00:35:32,063
What I need is more.

434
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:34,020
Information.

435
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:38,140
Locations, photographs, 
plans, names...

436
00:35:38,288 --> 00:35:40,471
- Oh, I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.

437
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:43,261
You're inside, 
don't give up now.

438
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:47,602
This never gonna end, is it?

439
00:35:53,038 --> 00:35:54,881
Marcus is expecting that.

440
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,483
This is all of it?

441
00:36:01,315 --> 00:36:02,923
I got what I need.

442
00:36:11,808 --> 00:36:12,743
What?

443
00:36:15,457 --> 00:36:18,672
I oughta walk back into Chthon
and tell Marcus yet

444
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:21,600
another one of his assassination
squad has been wiped out.

445
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:23,412
You got away and Vanessa is dead.

446
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:28,050
Yet, somehow I wound up walking away
with whatever was inside of her?

447
00:36:28,278 --> 00:36:29,931
Uh, he ain't buying that.

448
00:36:30,076 --> 00:36:31,403
What are you suggesting?

449
00:36:34,135 --> 00:36:35,790
I'm in a war.

450
00:36:35,957 --> 00:36:37,122
With you.

451
00:36:38,538 --> 00:36:40,333
I better look like it.

452
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:44,980
Collins?

453
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,301
So, I haven't heard from you
in the last 3 days.

454
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:48,443
Crime's still running.

455
00:37:48,697 --> 00:37:51,860
That's not your problem, 
Louisiana 's got that.
We're all done.

456
00:37:52,048 --> 00:37:53,652
Get on the plane and come home!

457
00:37:53,826 --> 00:37:55,622
You came back to early, 
you weren't ready.

458
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:57,240
But you're not hearing me.

459
00:37:57,436 --> 00:38:00,752
I'm gonna make this real simple,
you're relieved, you're completely
off this now!

460
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,812
Nat, look, I think...

461
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:04,971
I think I'm looking for a...

462
00:38:06,147 --> 00:38:07,281
a monster.

463
00:38:07,645 --> 00:38:11,583
Yeah, they're all monsters,
let someone else do it.

464
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:13,913
I have to do this!

465
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:16,513
Ray, I'm shit serious now,

466
00:38:16,688 --> 00:38:18,142
this is not about 
Sarah and Johanna,

467
00:38:18,308 --> 00:38:20,860
if you try to work something out
you do it on the couch with Dr Bishop.

468
00:38:21,015 --> 00:38:23,112
Do not screw up your carrier
over this now!

469
00:38:23,225 --> 00:38:24,413
Just go home!

470
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:25,612
Sorry.

471
00:38:48,866 --> 00:38:51,483
I'm sorry I lost the prize.

472
00:38:52,637 --> 00:38:53,662
It's ok.

473
00:38:54,057 --> 00:38:55,380
Krista's on the job.

474
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:57,901
Like I said...

475
00:38:58,188 --> 00:38:59,473
I'm sorry.

476
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:05,412
Domic's weight in.

477
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:06,500
He knows.

478
00:39:07,677 --> 00:39:09,493
He wants to enter exile

479
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:13,772
Heard of Aurora and he is forcing
Charlotte to plead his case to
the Pure Bloods.

480
00:39:13,907 --> 00:39:16,121
He's humiliating her.

481
00:39:16,238 --> 00:39:17,771
She doesn't see it that way.

482
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:24,103
You're humiliating her.

483
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:35,530
Sir, Krista's back.

484
00:39:36,268 --> 00:39:37,290
Thank you.

485
00:39:38,347 --> 00:39:39,431
I gotta go.

486
00:39:41,497 --> 00:39:42,391
You rest.

487
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:14,873
She tells me you had a
qualified success.

488
00:40:17,497 --> 00:40:18,532
What happened?

489
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:20,172
Blade happened.

490
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:22,702
Jakob and the rest of the team?

491
00:40:22,896 --> 00:40:24,013
Gone.

492
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:25,943
Vanessa?

493
00:40:26,315 --> 00:40:28,393
Disemboweled.

494
00:40:28,725 --> 00:40:30,443
I salvaged what I could.

495
00:40:31,398 --> 00:40:32,980
Blade got nothing.

496
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:38,732
You're certain?

497
00:40:42,586 --> 00:40:43,463
Good.

498
00:40:48,815 --> 00:40:49,992
There was no child.

499
00:40:51,305 --> 00:40:53,732
What she was carrying
was more valuable than life.

500
00:40:55,338 --> 00:40:56,380
Death?

501
00:40:59,535 --> 00:41:00,493
We'll see.

502
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:05,583
If that's all,
I'd like to get to medical.

503
00:41:07,978 --> 00:41:08,920
Of course.

504
00:41:14,846 --> 00:41:15,722
Krista!

505
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:20,062
Excellent work.

506
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,190
I have great plans
for you in the future.

507
00:41:25,045 --> 00:41:26,573
Happy to hear it.

508
00:42:49,248 --> 00:42:51,070
Next time on Blade.

509
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,663
Donny?

510
00:42:52,665 --> 00:42:54,233
Looks like your past is

511
00:42:54,288 --> 00:42:55,942
only coming back to haunt you.

512
00:42:57,816 --> 00:43:00,145
***, it's about me.

513
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:01,192
Derek?

514
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:03,353
Dad.

515
00:43:03,557 --> 00:43:05,443
- Something's happening to me?
- Yeah, son.

516
00:43:05,638 --> 00:43:07,893
He's going to find out what
he is soon enough.

517
00:43:08,027 --> 00:43:09,340
I'm his father, I'll handle it.

518
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:11,272
We can stay together for a while.

519
00:43:11,446 --> 00:43:13,990
We can stay together forever
if you want.

520
00:43:16,786 --> 00:43:17,932
Mr Brooks?

521
00:43:19,198 --> 00:43:20,113
Yeah.

522
00:43:20,316 --> 00:43:21,492
I'm here about the boy.

523
00:43:21,705 --> 00:43:23,153
I'm Abraham Whistler.
