**

8
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:04,805
You make me old with wisdom.

9
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:08,132
You make wine taste sweeter.

10
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:11,032
Who wrote that?

11
00:01:12,403 --> 00:01:14,976
I write a lot of poetry
when I'm inspired.

12
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:23,544
I guess I shouldn't be
surprised by anything you do.

13
00:01:25,157 --> 00:01:26,389
You shouldn't.

14
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:28,790
It's insulting.

15
00:01:32,407 --> 00:01:34,922
I have to keep you in line,
or I'll lose you.

16
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:37,341
Yes, you will.

17
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:42,108
I don't like the idea
of making you older.

18
00:01:44,658 --> 00:01:45,862
I just meant...

19
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:50,578
I don't know.

20
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,709
It doesn't matter how old I am.

21
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:03,133
Our souls are the same age.

22
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:20,285
Oh, God.

23
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:24,645
You're getting to me.

24
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:34,585
How do I know I'm not just going to eat
another mushroom and

25
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,578
this room will disappear
and I'll be back on a train to Trenton?

26
00:02:39,347 --> 00:02:41,097
Because I love you, Jane.

27
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:48,253
This is hard for you. I know it.

28
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:53,927
You don't want me to talk about it, but

29
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:58,640
Margaret and Mona have been
your life for the last 40 years.

30
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:00,071
30.

31
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,520
Listen,

32
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:08,610
I'm not being impulsive, because I've
been thinking about this all the time.

33
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:13,034
I want you to be my wife.

34
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:15,097
What?

35
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:18,224
Marry me.

36
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:23,748
- Roger, are you serious?
- Will you do that for me?

37
00:03:38,537 --> 00:03:41,101
90% of Right Guard users
say they play sports.

38
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,475
60% wear it
for their girls as well.

39
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,540
Most impressive, 80% of the fellas
saying yes to the question

40
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,854
"Does Right Guard make you
feel more confident at work?"

41
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:52,854
Did anyone watch
Loretta Younglast night?

42
00:03:52,974 --> 00:03:54,511
I was supposed to. What happened?

43
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:56,865
I can't even describe it,
it was so awful.

44
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:58,174
Creative,

45
00:03:58,294 --> 00:04:01,761
you think old Donny Draper will mind
if we think better on a full stomach?

46
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,913
Well, if you'll all swear
Gillette dropped in.

47
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,605
Are you kidding?

48
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:07,607
Absolutely.

49
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:10,565
I'll pretend they're here
if you give me some actual ideas.

50
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:14,180
Right Guard already has
a great campaign, men being men.

51
00:04:14,472 --> 00:04:17,158
You know, women smell bad, too.
Not you, of course.

52
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,847
- Women have perfume.
- "Perfume does not fight wetness."

53
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:23,799
Loretta Young.
She's my dad's favorite.

54
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:24,918
The aprons.

55
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:29,317
The nauseating upholstery on the couch.
Strangers who drop by.

56
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:31,941
- Hear from Kinsey?
- What do you mean?

57
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:34,056
Did you read what's
going on down there?

58
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:35,152
In this day and age.

59
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:37,711
The papers said it's going to
be Little Rock all over again.

60
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:40,023
I don't know why people
keep stirring up trouble.

61
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:42,660
It's bad for business. Just another
reason not to watch TV.

62
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:45,872
- Kurt doesn't even have one.
- You have to have one. It's your job.

63
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:48,007
You're going to miss the playoff.

64
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:50,462
It's a different life
for single men.

65
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,636
- What do you do with your spare time?
- I like

66
00:04:52,756 --> 00:04:56,382
- concerts. I like park.
- He saw Bob Dylan at Carnegie Hall.

67
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,526
I heard him on the radio.

68
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:00,552
So we're not going to work at all.

69
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:04,605
Tell Right Gua, short of a
new product just for women,

70
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:07,352
we need more research and time.
And lunch.

71
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:12,401
Ooh. Can we split a lobster?

72
00:05:18,706 --> 00:05:20,508
Does he sound like the album?

73
00:05:21,393 --> 00:05:23,743
When you hear him,
he plays it himself.

74
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:27,205
It must be something to see.
I'd love to go sometime.

75
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,166
- So go.
- Yes, I should.

76
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,408
You will go with me.

77
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:34,025
What?

78
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:35,712
You would go with me?

79
00:05:36,645 --> 00:05:37,645
Oh, no. I...

80
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:40,212
I don't want to impose
if you have plans.

81
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:42,661
When you hear him,
you will smile like this.

82
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,811
- Pick you up at 8.
- I live in Brooklyn. It's a hike.

83
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,603
Neighbors.

84
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:56,513
Joey says that Duck's in the blind.
It's now or never.

85
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,670
This is why I booked a day early.

86
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,340
What did Ricardo in there say?

87
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,965
He's an hourly contact with TWA, and
they've offered to buy you new luggage.

88
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,436
And fill it with my things?

89
00:06:28,857 --> 00:06:30,589
Ricardo recommended a tailor.

90
00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:31,709
Chinese.

91
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:35,244
And they said they've got
a whole shop full of swim trunks.

92
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:37,144
I brought mine.

93
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:40,026
There's not going
to be any swimming.

94
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:42,426
The convention doesn't
start for another day.

95
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,477
You want to be the hundredth person to
shake someone's hand at some convention?

96
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:47,071
For what, a free pen?

97
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:49,161
We'll follow-up face to face.

98
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,783
Forget Santa Monica.

99
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:54,714
Take your list, target some of
these guys, and make them feel special.

100
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:57,020
Didn't Roger give you leads?

101
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:58,261
He did.

102
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,257
I'm going to need sunglasses.

103
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,650
Come on.

104
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,978
You wanna be on vacation, Pete?
'Cause I can make that happen.

105
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:01,709
Old-fashioned.

106
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:06,275
Excuse me.

107
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:10,326
My friends and I have
been speculating about you,

108
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:13,162
trying to decide who you are
and what you do.

109
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:14,966
Why?

110
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:16,315
Are you an actor?

111
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:19,043
- No.
- Are you an astronaut?

112
00:08:19,836 --> 00:08:20,636
No.

113
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:23,714
Someone over there would like
to meet you, a young woman,

114
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,050
only if you were
none of these things.

115
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,990
I'm Vicompte Monteforte d'Alsace.

116
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:35,709
- Willy.
- Don.

117
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,858
This is Don.

118
00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:40,852
She's been staring at you all day.

119
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:42,910
Can't stop talking about you.

120
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:45,834
I'm Joy.

121
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,949
Oh, and this is Rocci.

122
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:53,591
You look so

123
00:08:53,989 --> 00:08:56,025
comfortable alone by the pool all day.

124
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:58,457
I wonder if you're waiting for someone.

125
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:01,169
I am.

126
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:03,129
Hmm.

127
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:05,561
Do you smell that jasmine?

128
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,728
Mmm. Dine with us.

129
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:13,945
- Maybe another time.
- Well. That never happens.

130
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:15,843
Hello.

131
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:20,306
Pete, this is Joy and Rocci
and Vicompte Monteforte.

132
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:21,728
Very good.

133
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,441
D'Alsace. Willy.

134
00:09:24,353 --> 00:09:26,802
That's quite a name.
Peter Dykeman Campbell.

135
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,863
Have we met somewhere? Newport?

136
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,714
I have a terrible memory for faces.

137
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:34,044
Nice meeting you.

138
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:34,964
Yes.

139
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:37,001
A pleasure to meet you.

140
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:41,101
Look for us.

141
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:49,925
Everybody here
is late for everything.

142
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:53,876
Oh. I just saw Tony Curtis
in the men's room.

143
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,305
Handing out towels?

144
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,379
Tony Curtis, Don.

145
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,055
A thing like that.

146
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:05,072
- Who's for dinner?
- Rodney Barnes.

147
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,921
Classic salesman turned executive.
And this interesting scientist,

148
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,151
Caleb Sawyer.

149
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:12,865
He has this "optiman" thesis.

150
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,669
In addition to rockets,

151
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:18,579
they're going to start engineering man,
you know, for travel in space.

152
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:21,530
Uh, new organs, super strength.

153
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,180
You know the Soviets
are working on it.

154
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,795
Are all of our meetings like this?

155
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,859
It's American Aviation
and Rocketdyne.

156
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:30,229
It's not a joke.

157
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:33,968
Can I get a drink here or what?

158
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,671
Raphael was a little tired.

159
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,317
But the Fifth Arrondissement
has most of your good restaurants.

160
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,920
Of course, we kept getting lost, and
every time Sherry asked for directions,

161
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,011
it turned out to be
another American.

162
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:57,743
Well, there you go. I'll take Jane
to Paris, and I'll send Mona to Reno.

163
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,821
You don't have to
marry her, do you?

164
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:02,433
No.

165
00:11:02,604 --> 00:11:05,710
Maybe you and Mona could work out
one of those modern arrangements.

166
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,211
George, stop.

167
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,339
It is possible that you'll get tired
of her, and then where will you be?

168
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:12,031
Mona doesn't have a right

169
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:14,635
to anything not my company money,
not my family money.

170
00:11:15,237 --> 00:11:17,296
She's lucky I'm giving her anything.
You know what?

171
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,391
We've been miserable for years. I don't
want to die with that woman.

172
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:21,542
Calm down.

173
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:23,685
I didn't know that.

174
00:11:24,793 --> 00:11:27,042
This is the life I was
always meant to have.

175
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:30,544
Congratulations.

176
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,697
Mona has the marriage license,
and she was to hurt you.

177
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:37,013
If you want to be with
this 20-year-old girl,

178
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:39,606
you're going to have to buy it
from her. And I have to warn you.

179
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:42,163
Women in this situation
become extra irrational.

180
00:11:43,044 --> 00:11:44,961
Well, how badly
does she want to hurt me?

181
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:47,217
I have a list of conditions
and an alimony that could

182
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:49,086
support Rita Hayworth.

183
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:51,547
Think of all the good things
in life and cut them in half.

184
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:54,258
I want you to push as hard as you can,
but I want it done.

185
00:11:55,468 --> 00:11:56,951
<i>Mr. Phillips is here.</i>

186
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:58,322
In a minute.

187
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,353
I'll proceed.

188
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:04,067
But I want you to think about it.

189
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:08,647
Duck Phillips,
this is George Rothman.

190
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:10,774
Actually, we know each other.

191
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:12,848
Roger.

192
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:15,497
It's good to see you, Duck.

193
00:12:30,603 --> 00:12:31,987
Was he for you or against you?

194
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:34,256
He's supposed to be the best.
Him or Marvin Hughes.

195
00:12:34,793 --> 00:12:36,243
That's who Mona has.

196
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:37,593
He's her cousin.

197
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,554
How bad was it? Do I want to know?

198
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:44,558
I don't think my circumstances
were the same as yours.

199
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:53,655
What can I do for you?

200
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:56,116
Actually, this might not be
the best time to talk about this.

201
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:58,562
Can't you tell I'd welcome
a change in subject?

202
00:12:58,682 --> 00:12:59,940
Well, good, then.

203
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:03,078
What the hell, right?

204
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,290
Listen, we're coming up
on two years together here.

205
00:13:09,463 --> 00:13:11,213
Did you get me something?

206
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:16,889
I think we're at a point in time

207
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,164
where I need to know
what your plans are.

208
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,678
A partnership.
I think I've earned it.

209
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:24,789
Right.

210
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:29,288
I'll bring it up at the
next meeting of the partners.

211
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:30,960
Thank you.

212
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:34,653
Of course you might have to come in
and be an advocate for yourself.

213
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,617
I'd be proud to present
my accomplishments.

214
00:13:36,737 --> 00:13:38,499
Good. Because I'm at a loss.

215
00:13:39,963 --> 00:13:41,489
What is that supposed to mean?

216
00:13:41,956 --> 00:13:44,410
You haven't exactly delivered
on that 30% you promised.

217
00:13:46,256 --> 00:13:48,719
I think we've really performed
in a very dismal year.

218
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,972
These things are cyclical.
You know that.

219
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:56,516
Is there some question
about my value to Sterling Cooper?

220
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,393
Just think about the board.
Bert Cooper hates everyone,

221
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,612
and his sister, well,
she does whatever he says.

222
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:04,262
Don...

223
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:08,740
Don... he's only 121/2%, but I can't say
he's your biggest cheerleader.

224
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,937
- What are you saying?
- Everyone thinks you're a fine fellow.

225
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:13,862
But if I were you,

226
00:14:14,508 --> 00:14:16,441
I'd go out there and make rain.

227
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,210
Thank you for being so candid.

228
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:27,452
This year

229
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:31,059
we have seen an historic collaboration
in American aerospace.

230
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:33,291
Building on Lockheed's
newPolaris A3,

231
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:36,577
Bell Aerosystems,
Areojet General, and NASA

232
00:14:36,697 --> 00:14:38,942
have developed
a restartable rocket engine.

233
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:40,686
Can we get the lights, please?

234
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,015
We at Space Technology Laboratories

235
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,693
have set our minds to the
challenges of the future.

236
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:51,134
In July,

237
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:54,141
Khrushchev said the Soviet Union
now has an anti-missile

238
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,411
that can hit a fly in outer space.

239
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:58,703
Space Technology Laboratories

240
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:00,518
is leading a coordinated effort

241
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:02,590
to create an invulnerable warhead...

242
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,018
multiple, independently targetable

243
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,201
re-entry vehicles, M. I. R. V. s.

244
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:11,080
And North American Aviation's vernier
thruster allows the primary missile

245
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:14,405
to correct its trajectory before
shooting off several warheads

246
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:16,236
hidden inside its nose cone.

247
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:21,172
The M.I.R.V. can be launched from a
submarine or land into the stratosphere.

248
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:26,011
Then it splits off
into 14 individual warheads.

249
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,516
That's 14 different targets.

250
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:31,678
14 different cities.

251
00:15:32,288 --> 00:15:33,935
14 individual warheads,

252
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:36,292
each with ten times
the payload of Nagasaki.

253
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,562
Even if Khrushchev hits 35%,

254
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:42,902
that's 5 out of 14.

255
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,175
Secondary strike capabilities
will be extremely limited...

256
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:51,328
... due to the decrease
in infrastructure and population.

257
00:15:54,602 --> 00:15:55,790
Total annihilation.

258
00:16:01,601 --> 00:16:05,146
Do you realize that one of these
companies spends more annually on media

259
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:06,789
than three Lucky Strikes?

260
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:08,572
It's a gold rush.

261
00:16:10,962 --> 00:16:12,286
Where are the valets?

262
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:14,745
So much for cheap labor.

263
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:16,671
Go see if General Dynamics
beat us here.

264
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,359
Drop these by the front desk.

265
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:20,729
You don't want them under your arm.

266
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:44,006
Hello.

267
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:46,341
I think you're happy to see me.

268
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,740
Well, take a good look.
I have to be on my way.

269
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,605
Are you working?

270
00:16:55,352 --> 00:16:56,152
Yes.

271
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,693
Oh. That's too bad.
I'm going to Palm Springs.

272
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:02,121
You should come with me.

273
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:04,817
I don't know about that.

274
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:10,221
Why would you deny yourself
something you want?

275
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:50,176
You want to get your things?

276
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:52,369
No.

277
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:02,886
Well.

278
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,558
Why don't we give it a few
more minutes? Enjoy the scenery.

279
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,591
Order some drinks.

280
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:12,141
I think Don need
to make a phone call.

281
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:25,625
Hello?

282
00:18:27,348 --> 00:18:28,979
Just leave the bags there.

283
00:18:32,397 --> 00:18:35,389
- Who lives here?
- Friends. They're in Sardinia.

284
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:39,047
I'm supposed to be
in Edward's room.

285
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:53,661
That's Stephanie
in the swimming pool.

286
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:57,473
And Willy and Rocci you've met.

287
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,886
And there's Greta
and her friend Carlos.

288
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:05,081
I'm surprised to see them
in the same place.

289
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:08,939
Come with me.

290
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:15,943
Hello, Greta.

291
00:19:16,063 --> 00:19:17,718
Hello, Joy, darling.

292
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:20,658
Who's this?

293
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:22,581
This is my friend Don.

294
00:19:23,753 --> 00:19:25,196
I'm Carlos Villa Declan.

295
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:29,783
It's medicinal.

296
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:35,390
Alguien importante?

297
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:37,479
Good-bye, Carlos.

298
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:45,350
Come for a swim with me?

299
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:52,653
You can go inside and ask for some
trunks, or you can goau naturel.

300
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:00,606
I think I should... go inside.

301
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:02,961
You're white as a sheet.

302
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:07,291
Don, are you okay?

303
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:30,999
Where am I?

304
00:20:31,812 --> 00:20:33,652
You're with me, remember?

305
00:20:34,072 --> 00:20:36,613
You have heat exhaustion.

306
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:40,033
- What are you doing?
- It's fine. It's medicine.

307
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,100
Klaus is a doctor.

308
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:46,081
No. It's okay. I just need
some water and some aspirin.

309
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:49,877
Everybody out.

310
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:52,212
I thought you were
going to break your neck.

311
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,943
Next time you feel faint,
lean towards the pool.

312
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:57,486
See you at dinner.

313
00:20:57,606 --> 00:21:00,136
Little girl, don't get any ideas.

314
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:01,980
This man needs rest.

315
00:21:05,526 --> 00:21:07,775
I found you some clothes upstairs.

316
00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:14,692
Who are these people?

317
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:17,112
They're friends.

318
00:21:21,378 --> 00:21:22,928
We're nomads together.

319
00:21:24,002 --> 00:21:25,852
What are you all doing here?

320
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:27,976
There's an open door policy.

321
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:31,460
You should rest up for dinner.
Have you ever had Mexican food?

322
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,962
- No.
- You're going to like it.

323
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:36,018
Come out when you're ready.

324
00:21:56,394 --> 00:21:58,987
You're spoiled. This is
great food. This is Mexican.

325
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:02,145
It's not. I don't like Mexican.
I wanted the French again.

326
00:22:02,265 --> 00:22:03,285
Sweetheard.

327
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,619
Mexican does pig. I don't eat
pig. I've already told you.

328
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:07,605
Okay, well.

329
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:14,826
- Oh, he's here.
- Oh. Ah! Don!

330
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:22,802
Klaus, will you let Don sit here?

331
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,113
Would you like some wine, Don?

332
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:39,486
- Klaus, is that okay?
- Hmm, he looks healthy enough.

333
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:42,698
- You must be hungry.
- Everyone,

334
00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:44,665
to our guest.

335
00:22:46,205 --> 00:22:48,954
To not being carried out in a box.

336
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:56,836
So, Don, what's your story?

337
00:22:58,731 --> 00:23:00,423
I don't know how to answer that.

338
00:23:01,365 --> 00:23:02,632
Where are you from?

339
00:23:04,294 --> 00:23:05,294
New York.

340
00:23:05,564 --> 00:23:08,427
Try this. It's a pepper
filled with cheese.

341
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,333
- Darling.
- And there's the sauce.

342
00:23:12,343 --> 00:23:14,426
Joy and Willy think
that you're a spy.

343
00:23:14,546 --> 00:23:17,176
But your wallet fell out
when they carried you inside.

344
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:20,068
- You're in advertising.
- Or I'm a really good spy.

345
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,207
You'll never meet a group people
more interested in professions, and yet

346
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:31,100
there is not one of us here who has one.

347
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,427
I'm a physician.

348
00:23:32,547 --> 00:23:33,997
But you don't work.

349
00:23:35,672 --> 00:23:37,722
So I assume you're all well off.

350
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:46,024
I should take something up. I'm smarter
than I've ever been in my life.

351
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,057
Not only do I know so much,

352
00:23:50,701 --> 00:23:53,560
- but my brain is more agile.
- And I didn't know that was possible.

353
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:58,205
And my muscles are remembering
their skills. Are you an athlete, Don?

354
00:24:00,165 --> 00:24:01,942
I've played some football
in high school.

355
00:24:02,062 --> 00:24:03,980
Willy was a champion fencer.

356
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:07,949
I made the Olympic team twice.

357
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:12,145
1948 London, 1952 Helsinki.

358
00:24:12,735 --> 00:24:13,545
Foils.

359
00:24:13,857 --> 00:24:15,307
It's hardly a sport.

360
00:24:21,797 --> 00:24:23,214
Let's play places.

361
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
I start.

362
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:28,426
You have to name a place
that starts with the last letter

363
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:29,845
of the place that's named.

364
00:24:32,858 --> 00:24:33,724
Guarnavaca.

365
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,536
Alaska.

366
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:37,126
It's not a city.

367
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,648
- Oh. Amalfi.
- Iran.

368
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:41,616
Naples.

369
00:24:41,736 --> 00:24:42,900
- Stockholm.
- Malaga.

370
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:44,502
Athens.

371
00:24:45,672 --> 00:24:46,672
Sarajevo.

372
00:24:47,294 --> 00:24:48,094
Oslo.

373
00:24:48,608 --> 00:24:49,408
Whoo!

374
00:24:49,985 --> 00:24:50,785
Wow.

375
00:24:51,085 --> 00:24:52,869
- O is impossible.
- Odessa.

376
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,787
Orezzo.

377
00:24:55,484 --> 00:24:57,677
- Osaka.
- Oakland.

378
00:24:59,046 --> 00:25:00,478
- Dunkirk.
- Kabul.

379
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:02,200
- London.
- Nice.

380
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,232
Essen.

381
00:25:03,352 --> 00:25:04,186
Nairobi.

382
00:25:05,548 --> 00:25:06,548
Itanbul.

383
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
Lisbon.

384
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:10,358
Negril.

385
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:12,487
Lausanne.

386
00:25:37,984 --> 00:25:40,259
- How old are you?
- I'm 21.

387
00:25:40,935 --> 00:25:42,080
How old are you?

388
00:25:42,923 --> 00:25:43,923
I'm 36.

389
00:25:51,728 --> 00:25:53,276
You're still warm.

390
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:56,798
Who are you?

391
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,799
I'm Joy.

392
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:53,025
There's glazed.

393
00:26:54,536 --> 00:26:56,536
Coconut, crullers.

394
00:26:58,572 --> 00:26:59,765
Oh, Bismarcks.

395
00:27:00,163 --> 00:27:02,556
- Who brought these in, Cosgrove?
- I haven't seen contracts,

396
00:27:02,676 --> 00:27:04,242
but this is certainly a good sign.

397
00:27:04,362 --> 00:27:05,751
Gosh, Joan, thank him for me.

398
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:09,610
We're going to be getting a delivery
like this every week,

399
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,350
- with all the varieties.
- Hmm, Lemonaires.

400
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:15,838
Are these for us?

401
00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:17,411
The spoils of victory.

402
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:18,950
8:00 in this ening.

403
00:27:19,592 --> 00:27:21,268
- Excuse me?
- Our destination.

404
00:27:21,838 --> 00:27:22,986
Oh. Okay.

405
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,397
- Where are you two going?
- To the Bob Dylan.

406
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,273
Isn't that interesting?

407
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:29,401
Peggy and Kurt
in the Village, oh, my.

408
00:27:31,474 --> 00:27:32,722
Oh, don't be shy.

409
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:35,074
I think you two are adorable.

410
00:27:37,485 --> 00:27:38,911
What is with this?

411
00:27:39,313 --> 00:27:40,619
You think Peggy and I?

412
00:27:41,248 --> 00:27:42,048
We do.

413
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:45,292
I'm homosexual.

414
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:50,397
I don't think that means
what you think it means.

415
00:27:50,955 --> 00:27:51,755
Kurt.

416
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:52,675
No.

417
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,135
I make love with the man, not the woman.

418
00:28:00,651 --> 00:28:01,451
What?

419
00:28:04,871 --> 00:28:05,744
Eight?

420
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:09,488
Of course. Absolutely.

421
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:25,539
Enjoy the dancing beans.

422
00:28:27,185 --> 00:28:28,668
Did you know about this?

423
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,652
He's from Europe.
It's different there.

424
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:33,506
More for me.

425
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,862
So Kurt is a pervert.

426
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:37,327
How about that?

427
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:39,380
He certainly had me fooled.

428
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,098
Mr. Cosgrove, do you want me
to invite the girls in?

429
00:28:42,626 --> 00:28:45,268
I knew queers existed. I just
don't want to work with them.

430
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:48,345
What, he's the first homo
you ever met in advertising?

431
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:54,502
You think Smitty's in love?

432
00:28:55,305 --> 00:28:56,985
Which bathroom does he use?

433
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,853
Joan, get the girls in here.

434
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:10,301
What are you reading?

435
00:29:11,328 --> 00:29:12,726
William Faulkner.

436
00:29:15,877 --> 00:29:18,327
I took a survey
of American literature.

437
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:21,133
So you're in school?

438
00:29:21,336 --> 00:29:22,651
I was at Pembroke.

439
00:29:23,753 --> 00:29:26,524
Willy has a house in Rhode Island,
so it seemed convenient.

440
00:29:28,064 --> 00:29:29,064
Didn't fit.

441
00:29:31,255 --> 00:29:32,187
Is it good?

442
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:33,726
Sex is good.

443
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:35,777
This book is just okay.

444
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:38,841
I like sex.

445
00:29:42,001 --> 00:29:43,651
You do, too, I can tell.

446
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:53,669
Greta and Carlos are arguing.

447
00:29:56,238 --> 00:29:57,872
I knew they had problems.

448
00:29:58,628 --> 00:29:59,626
Greta has.

449
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,488
Carlos never had any.

450
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,820
Good morning.

451
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:08,565
Good morning.

452
00:30:09,185 --> 00:30:10,506
Do you hear them in there?

453
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:12,871
Oh, the humiliations
have been spectacular.

454
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,311
Christien is coming with
the children. I hope you don't mind.

455
00:30:19,376 --> 00:30:22,031
No matter how late I show up,
I'm never later than Christien.

456
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:26,717
Look at him.

457
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:29,613
You are so beautiful.

458
00:30:32,585 --> 00:30:34,284
Papa, ne touche pas.

459
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,494
You are a brat.

460
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:38,382
She has her mother's temperament.

461
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:40,152
That's why you love me.

462
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:45,220
I make beautiful babies, don't I?

463
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:48,944
I'll see you outside.

464
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:53,078
That's your father?

465
00:30:55,222 --> 00:30:57,362
He doesn't want people
to think he's old.

466
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:05,846
Yes, it's Peter Campbell from
Sterling Cooper for Clarence Hastings.

467
00:31:06,877 --> 00:31:09,384
Is there any way we can meet here?
I can't drive,

468
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:12,123
and there doesn't seem to be a taxi
that will take me to Pasadena.

469
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:15,718
We can meet by the pool.

470
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:28,403
Thank you. How are you two today?

471
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:37,920
Duck Phillips.

472
00:31:38,735 --> 00:31:41,537
- St. John Powell, how are you?
- Capital, capital.

473
00:31:41,657 --> 00:31:42,986
This is Alec Barton.

474
00:31:43,441 --> 00:31:44,655
Duck Phillips.

475
00:31:48,536 --> 00:31:50,281
By Jove, man, catch up.

476
00:31:50,815 --> 00:31:52,465
I have a bit of a cold.

477
00:31:53,003 --> 00:31:55,500
Well, it's warm already.
It'll open up the passages.

478
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,974
Oh, it's warm or
he would have drunk it.

479
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:01,698
So, how are you finding New York?

480
00:32:01,818 --> 00:32:02,675
Brief.

481
00:32:03,442 --> 00:32:05,760
We're going to visit
a candy plant, the Cadbury.

482
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,346
- Then it's fate that I caught you here.
- You say fate.

483
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,955
I say another round, garçon.

484
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:13,235
Have mine.

485
00:32:18,283 --> 00:32:20,929
If y're not drinking,
what's this about?

486
00:32:22,506 --> 00:32:25,272
I keep thinking how I miss
doing things your way.

487
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:31,959
Two years ago, you said you wanted
to come here and be with your children.

488
00:32:32,572 --> 00:32:33,682
They're grown.

489
00:32:36,894 --> 00:32:38,411
It's not a good time.

490
00:32:39,611 --> 00:32:41,367
I'm not going to take "no"
for an answer.

491
00:32:41,487 --> 00:32:43,237
I wouldn't expect you to.

492
00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:46,481
You know,

493
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:50,089
if we were hiring, you
would be at the top of our list.

494
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:53,683
That's too bad.

495
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:56,560
I love you New York ad men.

496
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,734
To our noble profession.

497
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:05,174
Cin-cin.

498
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:23,148
How old are your children?

499
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:26,507
Alec's wife is about
to have their first.

500
00:33:28,478 --> 00:33:30,928
Do you think that I have
nothing to offer you?

501
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:35,744
No, of course not.

502
00:33:35,864 --> 00:33:38,025
You represent
over 20 American companies,

503
00:33:38,302 --> 00:33:39,975
doing business in Europe.

504
00:33:40,195 --> 00:33:42,118
I know you want a U.S. presence.

505
00:33:43,044 --> 00:33:45,943
You're wasting your time doing things
like digging around here for Cadbury.

506
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,494
And you could make a difference?

507
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:51,478
What if I were to bring you
every account at Sterling Cooper?

508
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:54,140
Fully serviced
and completely satisfied?

509
00:33:55,936 --> 00:33:57,318
What are you talking about?

510
00:33:57,438 --> 00:33:59,491
I'm suggesting that you
buy Sterling Cooper.

511
00:33:59,611 --> 00:34:01,240
There are very few
client conflicts.

512
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,656
All you have to do is
change the welcome mat.

513
00:34:03,884 --> 00:34:05,462
I didn't know it was for sale.

514
00:34:06,621 --> 00:34:09,165
Roger Sterling has
a 20-year-old fiancÃ©e,

515
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:12,382
and his wife's lawyer's not going
to leave him a pot to piss in.

516
00:34:17,568 --> 00:34:19,495
Alec, would you excuse us?

517
00:34:34,716 --> 00:34:36,910
Did he send you here with a price?

518
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:38,378
Send me here?

519
00:34:39,628 --> 00:34:43,428
51% will cost you a lot less than
you think, plus a finder's fee.

520
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:44,377
2%.

521
00:34:44,695 --> 00:34:46,791
I want to be in charge of
all international business,

522
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:48,667
and I have to be president.

523
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:51,488
Creative reports to me,
or the whole thing falls apart.

524
00:34:58,611 --> 00:35:00,559
Thank you for thinking of us.

525
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,349
To old friends.

526
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:09,941
Hello.

527
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,367
Did you have
any trouble finding me?

528
00:35:13,692 --> 00:35:15,684
- Neighbors.
- Right.

529
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:20,069
- Would you like some wine?
- Very much.

530
00:35:37,813 --> 00:35:38,743
Listen,

531
00:35:38,948 --> 00:35:41,350
in the office, I hope
you weren't embarrassed.

532
00:35:42,504 --> 00:35:44,771
No. It's okay. It's good.

533
00:35:47,332 --> 00:35:49,258
Well, if you have a man

534
00:35:49,378 --> 00:35:52,945
that you'd like to go to the concert
with tonight, I completely understand.

535
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:56,534
Are you not on the trip tonight?

536
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:04,269
I don't know why I pick
the wrong boys.

537
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:07,250
You're drinking sad.

538
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:11,379
I don't know.

539
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,749
What's wrong with me?

540
00:36:19,024 --> 00:36:20,478
You are old style.

541
00:36:23,304 --> 00:36:24,469
No, I'm not.

542
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:27,730
This is not modern office.
A working woman.

543
00:36:30,136 --> 00:36:31,691
What are you talking about?

544
00:36:32,445 --> 00:36:33,360
I fix you.

545
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:38,198
We should leave.

546
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,611
Each time, Bob Dylan is late.
He will not miss us a half hour.

547
00:36:44,938 --> 00:36:45,738
Sit.

548
00:36:47,693 --> 00:36:49,443
Look at me. I'm very good.

549
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:53,384
Just a trim.

550
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:54,504
Yes. Yes.

551
00:37:10,882 --> 00:37:11,825
For you.

552
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:14,735
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay. It's good.

553
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:28,677
We're headed to Lyford Cay, Nassau.

554
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:32,243
Why?

555
00:37:34,057 --> 00:37:35,377
It's what we do.

556
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,305
Something about taxes.

557
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:41,641
It's very different than here.

558
00:37:44,694 --> 00:37:46,244
I think you'd like it.

559
00:37:57,988 --> 00:37:59,527
You'll need a tuxedo.

560
00:38:00,357 --> 00:38:01,157
Will I?

561
00:38:04,304 --> 00:38:07,562
You don't need a passport, unless
you want to follow us to Capri after.

562
00:38:09,128 --> 00:38:11,041
Stephanie's uncle's an ambassador.

563
00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:14,055
Joy.

564
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:18,368
My father will take care of you.

565
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:20,233
He likes having you around.

566
00:38:20,353 --> 00:38:22,594
You're beautiful,
and you don't talk too much.

567
00:38:26,486 --> 00:38:28,019
I'm not possessive.

568
00:38:29,755 --> 00:38:31,805
You can be with anyone you want.

569
00:38:45,692 --> 00:38:47,411
Hello, Joy. Who is this?

570
00:38:47,913 --> 00:38:49,592
Christien, this is Don.

571
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:51,414
Bernard and Amelia.

572
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,209
Hello.

573
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,680
Hello.

574
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:56,818
Hello there.

575
00:38:57,943 --> 00:38:59,005
Did Isabel ring?

576
00:38:59,745 --> 00:39:00,818
Why would she?

577
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,926
Because I'm sick of her attorneys.

578
00:39:03,386 --> 00:39:05,388
These are my children.
They should be with me.

579
00:39:08,443 --> 00:39:10,183
Are you in Edward's room?

580
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,130
You can have it.

581
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,105
Thank you.

582
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:16,721
As you can see, we're very tired.

583
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:24,794
Come, Bernard.

584
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:30,507
You gave away our room?

585
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,925
Looks like someone
doesn't want to sleep.

586
00:40:14,735 --> 00:40:15,695
Come in.

587
00:40:17,454 --> 00:40:19,127
Joyce seems to have stepped away.

588
00:40:21,134 --> 00:40:23,528
I'm sorry, but Mr. Crane
accidentally opened this.

589
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,924
Thank you, Joan.

590
00:40:27,312 --> 00:40:29,631
My, oh, my. A case.

591
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:31,679
They're all there. I checked.

592
00:40:32,052 --> 00:40:34,352
All the card says
is that it's for you.

593
00:40:35,043 --> 00:40:36,771
Well, thank you, Miss Holway.

594
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:39,963
Why don't you just take this?
As a finder's fee.

595
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:43,074
- A whole bottle?
- It's the good stuff.

596
00:40:43,194 --> 00:40:44,733
I know. Thank you.

597
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:47,323
- Anything else?
- No, thank you.

598
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,878
<i>The town of Oxford
is an armed camp,</i>

599
00:41:03,112 --> 00:41:06,199
<i>following riots that accompanied
the registration of the first Negro</i>

600
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,669
<i>in the university's
118-year history.</i>

601
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:11,353
<i>James H. Meredith was formally
enrolled in the University...</i>

602
00:41:11,473 --> 00:41:12,598
Hello, all.

603
00:41:12,974 --> 00:41:14,308
How the hell was California?

604
00:41:14,634 --> 00:41:16,826
Looks like Draper
let you off the leash.

605
00:41:16,946 --> 00:41:18,137
Did you see this?

606
00:41:18,257 --> 00:41:20,689
Yes, I did. Strange, isn't it?

607
00:41:21,057 --> 00:41:22,594
<i>Americans are free in short</i>

608
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,653
<i>to disagree with the law,
but not to disobey it.</i>

609
00:41:27,524 --> 00:41:28,574
So how was it?

610
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:32,417
Spectacular, business-wise, but I
don't know that I'd want to live there.

611
00:41:33,321 --> 00:41:34,829
Here. These are for everybody.

612
00:41:35,345 --> 00:41:36,889
I'd like to see it for myself.

613
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:38,140
What's wrong with it?

614
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,260
The people.

615
00:41:40,195 --> 00:41:41,195
I don't know.

616
00:41:42,142 --> 00:41:43,646
I'm glad to be home.

617
00:41:44,177 --> 00:41:45,713
Has Don checked in? Is he here?

618
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,639
No. I don't think so.

619
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:49,467
<i>... by force, or threat of force,</i>

620
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:51,764
<i>could long deny that man...</i>

621
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,334
You look different.

622
00:41:53,697 --> 00:41:54,697
It's my hair.

623
00:41:55,636 --> 00:41:56,483
Right.

624
00:41:57,134 --> 00:41:58,282
Kurt's a homo.

625
00:41:58,692 --> 00:42:00,854
<i>No judge would be sure of his...</i>

626
00:42:13,192 --> 00:42:14,150
So...

627
00:42:15,712 --> 00:42:17,468
are you leaving us?

628
00:42:18,655 --> 00:42:19,455
No.

629
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,375
So? What, then?

630
00:42:21,849 --> 00:42:24,010
What if I told you that
the international divisions

631
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:26,589
of General Foods, Bird's Eye,
Campbell's Soup

632
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,216
Chevron Oil, Lever Brothers, Hoover,

633
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:31,399
Warner Brothers, Eastern Airlines

634
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:34,086
and Chrysler can all
be part of Sterling Cooper?

635
00:42:34,878 --> 00:42:36,140
How is that possible?

636
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:38,822
St. John Powell,

637
00:42:38,942 --> 00:42:41,573
of Putnam, Powell, and Lowe,
called me the other day.

638
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:45,110
They want to open up a New York office
to deal with their American clients.

639
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,553
They love the idea of just sticking
a key in the door at Sterling Cooper.

640
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,175
Really?

641
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:54,950
Is this as solid
as American Airlines?

642
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:58,629
I guess you're happy having to scramble
on the third tier of this industry

643
00:42:59,007 --> 00:43:01,999
waiting for minor divisions
of major companies to drop in your lap.

644
00:43:04,031 --> 00:43:06,263
On the table will be
mountains of money,

645
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,823
international prestige,

646
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:10,716
a chance at going public, and we
don't have to change our name.

647
00:43:15,421 --> 00:43:17,452
- I guess we could think about it.
- No.

648
00:43:17,814 --> 00:43:19,926
I need to know
that you're open to this.

649
00:43:20,046 --> 00:43:23,051
If so, I'm giving them
five business days to try to impress us

650
00:43:23,171 --> 00:43:25,301
with a price for controlling
interest in the agency.

651
00:43:25,421 --> 00:43:26,675
There he is.

652
00:43:26,873 --> 00:43:29,150
There's the man
I heard so much about.

653
00:43:30,646 --> 00:43:32,240
Five days to make an offer.

654
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,304
Or you can give me a price
and I'll pass it on.

655
00:43:34,424 --> 00:43:35,224
No.

656
00:43:36,235 --> 00:43:37,985
Let them open the kimono.

657
00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:43,635
Daddy! Daddy! Over here!

658
00:43:44,549 --> 00:43:45,999
This water is cold.

659
00:43:49,797 --> 00:43:51,011
Stop splashing!

660
00:43:51,324 --> 00:43:52,957
Don't do it, darling.

661
00:44:33,035 --> 00:44:34,858
Hello. It's Dick Whitman.

662
00:44:38,582 --> 00:44:39,409
Yeah.

663
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:43,809
I'd love to see you.

664
00:44:44,873 --> 00:44:45,673
Soon.

665
00:44:48,014 --> 00:44:50,497
No. I didn't bring it
with me. Hold on.

666
00:45:04,609 --> 00:45:05,959
I'll see you soon.
