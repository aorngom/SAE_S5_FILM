00:00:01,814 --> 00:00:03,696
Welcome to the Work Bench!

2
00:00:03,697 --> 00:00:05,948
Hello! Welcome to the Work Bench.

3
00:00:05,949 --> 00:00:10,267
Your aura is so strong today,
just really beautiful

4
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:11,870
Good for you!

5
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,083
- What is that?
- New greater.

6
00:00:14,084 --> 00:00:15,672
Welcome to the Work Bench.

7
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:19,103
- You look like you need help.
- No, we work here.

8
00:00:19,136 --> 00:00:21,160
That is so ... GREAT!

9
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:23,555
I am Mary Pat. I just started today.

10
00:00:24,506 --> 00:00:25,935
Group hug!

11
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,628
No.

12
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:32,641
It's like that gum that bursts that stuff in your mouth.

13
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:35,657
- Le flavor?
- Yeah, exactly, I hate that gum.

14
00:00:35,692 --> 00:00:38,461
- Any word from Tony?
- No, I can't get hold of him.

15
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:40,931
You sure he'll be able to translate the incantation?

16
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:43,780
Tony has been a demon since the original fall,
if anyone can it's him

17
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:46,246
Yeah, he can. I mean he has to.

18
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:48,061
Ach... my apron is in the stock room.
I'll be right back

19
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:49,603
All right.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,752
Is so sad.

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,194
Taken so young. So full of life.

22
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:12,789
Who, the monkey?

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,063
They called him Jimbo.

24
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,792
Jimbo the dancing monkey.

25
00:01:17,793 --> 00:01:19,367
Any time I felt a bit blue.

26
00:01:19,368 --> 00:01:21,083
I came and I watched Jimbo dance,

27
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:22,799
dance that monkey dance.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,077
He was even thought to pickpocket.

29
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,786
so multi-talent.

30
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:28,577
Sorry?

31
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:30,834
So, ehm, new soul?

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,091
- Sam?
- Yeah?

33
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:39,119
I need my Jimbo fix.

34
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:41,244
I want you to dance like a monkey.

35
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:44,377
- No.
- Yes! I want you to put on this fez

36
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:46,650
And dance like Jimbo.

37
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:47,635
You are out of your skull.

38
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:49,508
I am not making a monkey dance for you.

39
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,768
Perhaps you do not understand the
exact nature of our relationship

40
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:54,390
I own you. When I ask you to do something,

41
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:56,699
You just do it. That's simple.

42
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:05,583
- I hate you.
- I know.

43
00:02:07,322 --> 00:02:09,975
Dance monkey, dance!

44
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:17,009
Oh, come on!

45
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,274
Put your heart and soul into it man!

46
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,500
Dance like your life depends upon it!

47
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:23,890
It does!

48
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:28,338
Monkey dance!

49
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:30,560
He's doing the monkey dance!

50
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:33,161


51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000


52
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,769
Welcome to the Work Bench!
Have a fantastic day!

53
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:44,888
It's been a horrible day

54
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,787
First he sticks me with the sucky soul assignment

55
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:48,739
and then he makes me dance like a monkey?

56
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,671
Yeah, I'm afraid I have to side with the devil on that one, Sammy

57
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,774
Sound like a pretty special monkey.

58
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:56,052
- Thanks for understanding
- You got it.

59
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,955
Soul is Roger Lund. Says
is a dug dealer.

60
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,458
Wow. Must be a pretty bad ass to need this

61
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,611
Yeah, speaking of bad ass,

62
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,639
You're about to witness
the maiden voyage

63
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,747
of the color-blendo 3000 paint mixer.

64
00:03:12,748 --> 00:03:14,162
Did you read the instructions?

65
00:03:14,163 --> 00:03:16,315
All I need is an on switch, Sammy.

66
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:17,970
Instructions? Pfffth!

67
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,053
That was awesome!

68
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:40,766
Mary Pat, are you all right?

69
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:42,119
Of course, silly.

70
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,896
My fairies put this lucky penny on the floor.

71
00:03:44,897 --> 00:03:46,533
They saved me.

72
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,422
Y-your what?

73
00:03:47,423 --> 00:03:50,201
My fairies. They protect me from harm.

74
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:54,614
Welcome to the Work Bench. Have
a splendid day!

75
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:06,627
Let's do it.

76
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:13,864
- Unit 5, This is the place.
- This soul is a drug dealer?

77
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:16,658
Obviously not a real good one.
I expected it to be... you know..

78
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,745
- Swankier?
- Yeah more swank.

79
00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:20,586
Hey woo, where did you get those?

80
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:23,761
- Bench, gardening section.
- Reasonably priced.

81
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:44,165
- Hey.
- Hey.

82
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:46,284
You're hunting buffalo, or something?

83
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:48,471
We are here to send you back to hell.

84
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:52,193
Oh, no, man. That is tragic!

85
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:55,485
Wait. Just let me get my tickle on first.

86
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:58,221
His tickle you know. His mellow.

87
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:00,432
Shake hands with Zeus,
ride on the wavy train,

88
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,135
- Storm in the gates of Mordor.
- He wants to get high.

89
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,978
- Thank you.
- Just say no.

90
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:06,564
Oh, man don't be like that

91
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:08,969
You know what a complete downer hell is?

92
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,421
I have to be racked to face that again.

93
00:05:11,983 --> 00:05:13,289
Please?

94
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,319
All right, fine, just hurry up.

95
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:20,074
If you wanna to get high,
yet keep your body clean...

96
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:23,464
Licking a toad is really the best way.

97
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:26,587
Unless you get a poisoned one.

98
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:32,587
No. No, thank you.

99
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:38,093
Sam, Sam!

100
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:39,560
Get him, Benji!

101
00:05:39,934 --> 00:05:41,462
Sammy!

102
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:45,351
Sock, get the vessel! The vessel!

103
00:05:54,051 --> 00:05:55,659
Yeah!

104
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:02,494
That feels like a rope.
Like I fire hose, you know?

105
00:06:02,585 --> 00:06:04,724
Do you have any idea what you can do with a licker like that?

106
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:06,641
Beyond the obvious, I mean.

107
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,978
No, no! We are not bringing those home with us.

108
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:12,928
What... I don't want the death
of innocent toads on my conscious

109
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:14,458
Do you?

110
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,218
Right, fine, fine. Bring them. Bring them.

111
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:18,064
Great, you can get the other tanks.

112
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,648
Great moment to make an executive decision, Sam.

113
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:25,928
King Charlie,

114
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:27,824
meet Principe.

115
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:30,040
Now you can kiss the prince all day,

116
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:34,034
But he will always stay small, green and ugly.

117
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:35,427
Right?

118
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:37,624
Coming.

119
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:39,934
OK, come on.

120
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:46,128
- Hi grandma.
- Hola, Benjamin.

121
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:48,260
Come in, sit down.

122
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:50,071
Grandma, how are you? Are you OK?

123
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:51,664
How is your heart?

124
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:54,406
- You look good.
- I look like garbage.

125
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:56,702
My health is ailing, mijo.

126
00:06:56,703 --> 00:06:58,652
I fear I'm not long for this world

127
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:00,451
Don't say that grandma.

128
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:04,631
But until that time comes I wanna tie up
loose ends.

129
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,875
and to apologize for the way I treated your girlfriend.

130
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:13,044
I'm inviting you to dinner at my house.

131
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:16,447
- Both you and Nina.
- Really?

132
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:19,819
I don't wanna leave this world with regrets.

133
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:22,441
Ok, yeah, yeah, we'll come to dinner.

134
00:07:27,224 --> 00:07:29,050
W-w-w-what is this a zoo?

135
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:35,306
Hey.

136
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:36,817
Any luck finding what the symbols mean?

137
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:38,501
Not even close.

138
00:07:38,502 --> 00:07:40,972
I think some of these are older than language.

139
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:43,713
Cooool!

140
00:07:43,948 --> 00:07:46,442
You guys think in magik with a k too?

141
00:07:46,443 --> 00:07:49,437
My fairies got me believing in all things supernatural.

142
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:51,746
- Your fairies?
- Well they save me from everything.

143
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:53,620
Always looking out for me.

144
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:56,698
Just wish they'd save me from my self filthy habit

145
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:59,816
Have super fun with your book on the occult!

146
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:04,463
She's sweet.

147
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,535
In a crazy Chucky Cheese animatronic
creature kinda way.

148
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:13,588
Is she smoking up with the propane tanks?

149
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:20,328
Oh, my God!

150
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:27,329
Oh, my God.

151
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:31,643
Mary Pat!

152
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:33,013
Are you OK?

153
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:35,476
- Am I all right?
- Yeah.

154
00:08:35,634 --> 00:08:36,895
I'm...

155
00:08:37,753 --> 00:08:39,314
Incredible!

156
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:43,592
I was surrounded by the heavenly warmth
of a hundred fairies!

157
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:45,520
Message received!

158
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:47,720
That's my last cigarette ever!

159
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:50,331
Okay, we need to get you looked at. Come on.

160
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,932
The blast went around her?

161
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,760
Maybe she really was protected by a fairy.

162
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:06,286
Oh, Sam!

163
00:09:06,593 --> 00:09:08,099
A fairy?

164
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:09,495
Steve?

165
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:12,651
Do I look like a fairy to you?
Whop don't answer that!

166
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,317
Come here!

167
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:21,761
I just keep telling myself,
"you gotta start at the bottom, Steve".

168
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,223
Even though you were among the holiest of hoes,

169
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:27,715
Even though guardian angel
duty is super entry level.

170
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:30,868
and completely beneath me,
rise above.

171
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:32,990
Dignity, class, beauty....

172
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:34,472
That is my mantra.

173
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,763
- Great. Listen, Steve...
- So these days I just spend my time...

174
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:41,203
protecting that fairy loving whacko from killing herself.

175
00:09:41,204 --> 00:09:42,852
Just a stepping stone.

176
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:47,722
Just a weird, crazy, accident prone stepping stone,

177
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:49,107
with no fashion sense.

178
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:51,040
Hey Steve, do you have
any idea where Tony is?

179
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,736
Yes I do. He is at a Spa in Tahoe
with little Stevie.

180
00:09:54,737 --> 00:09:57,000
It is this wonderful place we used to go to.

181
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:58,310
And you know what it is?

182
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:00,413
They just, they both need a little bit pampering these days.

183
00:10:00,414 --> 00:10:03,066
Dam it. I need him to translate something.

184
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,966
You know what? Maybe you can do it.

185
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:10,318
Where did you get this?

186
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,752
We copied it from a scroll my dad found in hell.

187
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:14,421
Nina says is an old demon language.

188
00:10:14,422 --> 00:10:16,033
Yeah.

189
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:18,544
- Can you read it?
- Oh, well, I mean,

190
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,962
Tony really was more the reader
in the relationship.

191
00:10:20,963 --> 00:10:22,441
But, ahm,

192
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,686
I think I can translate.

193
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:25,902
That's great! What does it say?

194
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:29,788
Okay, well, I believe this is an incantation

195
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:32,252
summoning the devil into a...

196
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:34,484
- contest.
- Yes!

197
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:36,472
Yeah! That's, that's exactly what it is.

198
00:10:36,473 --> 00:10:38,356
OK how--how do I do it?

199
00:10:38,415 --> 00:10:40,630
Okay, you have to say these words, exactly.

200
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:42,005
And then he'll appear,

201
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:46,074
And then he is compelled
to compete in a contest that you choose.

202
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:47,713
If you give me a day I can write down

203
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,870
a phonetic pronunciation for you.

204
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:51,115
Thank you, thank you, you are amazing.

205
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:53,424
You have no idea what this means to me.

206
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:57,369
Ahm, what contest should I do?

207
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,689
That depends on you, Sam.

208
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,590
I mean it's... you know it's whatever you are good at.

209
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:04,728
- Right, right, what I am good at.
- Yeah.

210
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:09,217
Sam? Sam, come on, Sam.

211
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:10,713
Everybody is good at something.

212
00:11:10,714 --> 00:11:12,401
You are...

213
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:14,612
in shape.

214
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:17,031
- Sports?
- No, I am terrible.

215
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:20,070
- Okay. Math?
- Even worst.

216
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:21,834
Moving on to the arts.

217
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:23,610
Pictionary!

218
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:26,626
Never played it. Sounds too much like dictionary.

219
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,354
Music.

220
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:30,577
Yes!

221
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,784
That's it! That is it. You are a genius!

222
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,337
So what is all this stuff?

223
00:11:39,338 --> 00:11:41,957
Stuff that my mother saved
from elementary school.

224
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,298
Aha, this is it!

225
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,372
My ticket out of my deal with the devil.

226
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,308
I didn't know you played
a musical instrument, Sam.

227
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:49,227
Neither did I.

228
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:52,385
Yeah, in third grade Ms. Ward said
I was the best in the class.

229
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:54,141
She made me first chan in the school orchestra.

230
00:11:54,142 --> 00:11:55,367
I was better than fourth graders.

231
00:11:55,368 --> 00:11:57,762
All right, Sammy, let's hear a little zap.

232
00:11:57,763 --> 00:11:58,654
I didn't play in a while,

233
00:11:58,655 --> 00:12:00,553
but should be like riding a bike, right?

234
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,883
Go on.

235
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:08,234
There it is.

236
00:12:15,957 --> 00:12:18,189
Okay, bring it back, bring it back.

237
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,583
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

238
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:24,467
All right, Sammy, you are good at something.

239
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:26,901
Righ? Right? Right?
See, I can do this!

240
00:12:26,902 --> 00:12:28,776
You got it.

241
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:45,007
Oh, my God, Andi!

242
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:46,963
You spoke to me just now.

243
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:50,007
I thought you just spoke to my heart, and Ben's I think.

244
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:51,908
I played all through high school.

245
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:53,237
And you quit in third grade, Sam.

246
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:55,512
I have a feeling that the devil is probably better than me.

247
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,857
You're right, who am I kidding?

248
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:04,315
Drink it!

249
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:08,182
Drink up, Benji, Drink up!

250
00:13:08,183 --> 00:13:12,608
Look, you have been by far
the most considerate boyfriend.

251
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:15,002
And yet how is that going to help me
to get out my deal with the devil?

252
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,009
Well my mom liked you better than any other
guy I dated.

253
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,945
Again, not helpful. I can't challenge the devil to

254
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:24,614
be a nice boyfriend contest.

255
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:27,923
- Face it, I suck at everything.
- That's not true, Sammy.

256
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,058
You are good at a lot of things.

257
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,809
You can challenge him to a power nap contest.

258
00:13:35,283 --> 00:13:37,969
You guys remember why
I was always the designated driver?

259
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:43,105
Nice, Sammy.

260
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:44,806
Because I never, ever

261
00:13:44,974 --> 00:13:46,533
had to drink.

262
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,165
Oh, my God! Sam! Wow!

263
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:54,702
Because I never, ever missed.
Ben put it on the floor.

264
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,466
Put it on the floor, Benji.

265
00:13:56,612 --> 00:13:58,666
Floor! Floor! Floor!

266
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:05,547
You are amazing.

267
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:07,932
Oh, my God, that's it!

268
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:10,433
I got it! I got the devil! I can get out of my deal!

269
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,149
Yeah you can.

270
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:21,587
Grandma hates double ding-dongs

271
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:24,446
Ben, sweetie, don't be so nervous.

272
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:29,779
Hi, Benjamin!
give your abuela a big kiss!

273
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:32,804
Hello, grandma Gonzales.

274
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,912
Thank you so much for inviting us.

275
00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:38,167
Well thank you for blessing my home
with your visit.

276
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,045
- Come in.
- Okay.

277
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:44,144
Ben, Nina, I want you to meet father O'Malley.

278
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,265
Father O'Malley, this is my grandson.

279
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:48,016
and the girl that I spoke you about.

280
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:50,321
- How do you do?
- Ah, why is he here?

281
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,181
- Ah, I am here to help.
- Help what?

282
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:56,033
Padre O'Malley is an exorcist.

283
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:57,541
An exorcist?

284
00:14:57,576 --> 00:15:02,441
Yes, your grandmother informed me
of Nina's demonic possession.

285
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:05,311
I am here to server God's
eviction notice.

286
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:07,687
What? No, no, there will be no exorcism.

287
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:10,443
We all want the same thing!

288
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:12,712
We want you to be happy.

289
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,314
And you!

290
00:15:14,586 --> 00:15:17,916
We want you the be cleansed of that foul corruption

291
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,197
Oh, I just thought we discuss it
over some Paella.

292
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:23,880
Grandma, I love Nina, understand?

293
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,576
I love her just the way she is.

294
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:27,769
But like always you gotta make everything

295
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,590
the way you think it should be!
We're out of here.

296
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:32,634
Ben, I do it for you!

297
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:34,501
I do it for you, Ben!

298
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:37,901
- I know you better than that.
- Then you know that I mean what I say.

299
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:42,973
Until your lady is free of all evil
you are out of this family.

300
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:46,157
- Out!
- Bye!

301
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:52,060
Okay, that's four all right?

302
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:55,678
Andi, Andi, Andi, you don't have to
drink every time I sink one in.

303
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,452
Sammy, this is the way the game is played.

304
00:15:57,453 --> 00:16:00,332
- So, yes I do.
- No, you don't.

305
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:02,734
Oh, my God.

306
00:16:04,247 --> 00:16:07,398
- You OK?
- You must hate me.

307
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:08,941
Why would I hate you?

308
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:10,754
Because you even say so yourself, Sam!

309
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:12,295
I thought you were evil.

310
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:13,707
Evil.

311
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:16,155
You know what I did?
I gave you the boot.

312
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:19,506
- I don't hate you.
- So when you need me,

313
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:20,892
Where am I?

314
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,956
Bail on you. Bail on you every time!

315
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:27,206
This would be a lot to handle for anyone.

316
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,075
Most people would completely freak out.

317
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:30,307
But not you. You have been great!

318
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:32,807
You've been better than great.
You've been amazing.

319
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:39,328
- Let's have sex.
- Let's what?

320
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:42,321
Yeah, you know what, because, because I want to be there for you.

321
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:43,574
Yep.

322
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:45,330
And I want to be there on you.

323
00:16:45,331 --> 00:16:47,527
Andi, wow! Andi, Andi!

324
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:50,308
Ehi, ehi, ehi! Are you OK?

325
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:52,333
OK.

326
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:54,147
OK, I'm gonna n-need your help.

327
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:56,406
I'm getting nuded for you.

328
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:58,403
I have a better idea.

329
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:05,030
You need some rest.
I need more practice.

330
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:06,311
OK.

331
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:08,379
I love you.

332
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:10,651
I love you too.

333
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,920
L-l-l-listen the point is,
Benjamin, I invented it.

334
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:22,926
- No... no you didn't!
- Yes, I did!

335
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:25,145
Oh, my God, dudes have been doing sex moves

336
00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:26,809
- For like a thousand of years!
- So?

337
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,965
There is literally nothing that hasn’t been done.

338
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,301
Except this! The shark attack is mine!

339
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:32,675
Wow, wow, what's the new move?

340
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,547
Sock thinks he invented the shark attack.

341
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:36,685
The shark attack, yeah.

342
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:38,200
All right, basically is like in Jaws.

343
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:39,724
When like all you see the shark's fin, right?

344
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,034
So what happens is: the lady lies on the bed

345
00:17:41,035 --> 00:17:43,050
Naked preferably, dude does this crab walk

346
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:45,092
Around the foot of the bed, so all she can see...

347
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:46,794
Is the shark's fin, You dig?

348
00:17:46,795 --> 00:17:48,137
OK, have you done the shark's attack?

349
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:49,430
- Every time I have sex.
- Lies!

350
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:50,802
I can tell you that Egyptian Pharaohs

351
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,254
used to do it like twice a week,  OK and-and

352
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:55,027
probably only called it like Dinosaur attack,
or something like that

353
00:17:55,028 --> 00:17:56,493
- So that is what they called it?
- It is been done!

354
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,196
Oh, the Mastodon? Is that what they called it?

355
00:17:58,197 --> 00:18:01,521
You and your crazy ideas.
You are going to back that up?

356
00:18:01,522 --> 00:18:04,386
So, I translated the scroll. This is the incantation

357
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:06,514
you need to challenge the devil.

358
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:07,842
OK.

359
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:09,350
And the suit?

360
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:11,565
The suit is an exact copy of the devil's suit.

361
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:12,935
only in your size.

362
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:14,516
See, there was a final symbol in the scroll

363
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:18,584
which translates to "reflection"
meaning you need to reflect the devil,

364
00:18:18,585 --> 00:18:21,335
Appear his equal. Is mostly
kinda a symbolic gesture.

365
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:22,608
You know it levels the playing field.

366
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:24,089
- Take that.
- OK.

367
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,650
As the devil reflection,

368
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:27,491
You need to always stand up straight.

369
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:29,818
You need to keep that arrogant swagger.

370
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,484
A tan would not hurt.

371
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,088
And never, ever, let him see you sweat.

372
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:36,572
I will.

373
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:38,341
I will be rooting for you.

374
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:44,669
Flight 11 to control tower
we are coming in for final approach.

375
00:18:44,903 --> 00:18:47,320
No! No, Ben, no more fry planes.

376
00:18:47,321 --> 00:18:49,363
Please, open the hangar doors!

377
00:18:49,364 --> 00:18:52,539
Ben, listen. I wanted to thank you.

378
00:18:53,204 --> 00:18:55,322
For standing up to your grandmother.

379
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:59,162
- I think that was really sweet.
- Anything for you, baby.

380
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:04,216
So, how long do you think before she stops being mad at you?

381
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:06,367
Never.

382
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,193
I am dead to nana.

383
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:10,018
Which means I am dead to the family.

384
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,623
Soon all evidence of Benjamin
Casper Perez Gonzalez will be erased.

385
00:19:14,824 --> 00:19:16,978
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

386
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:20,220
Being stripped of my personal history
and emotional identity.

387
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:23,143
But, hey, look what I get in return.

388
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:25,430
You!

389
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:27,725
Give me a cup of sugar.

390
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:33,639
Nice.

391
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,851
What do you want, Pacey?

392
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:37,849
There is some dude outside
jacking your ride.

393
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,965
Baby, they are towing your car!

394
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:43,340
Jose?

395
00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:45,772
- You know him?
- Yeah, he's my cousin.

396
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:49,489
Jose, what are you doing?
Jose, what the hell man?

397
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,561
She said I am not allowed to speak to you.

398
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:52,824
Who?

399
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,502
I am having the car repossessed.

400
00:19:57,503 --> 00:19:58,877
But I bought it!

401
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:02,297
Oh yeah, while I co-signed the loan.
That when I had a grandson.

402
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:04,774
I don't have a grandson anymore.

403
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:07,349
Don't worry.

404
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,399
I get you a good car.

405
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:11,538
You like Pontiac?

406
00:20:11,622 --> 00:20:14,105
I get you a Pontiac Vibe.

407
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:16,099
Nice car.

408
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,556
Sexy.

409
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:30,005
What?

410
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:33,500
Sam?

411
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:47,612
Oh my gracious, look at this, huh?

412
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:48,895
Oh, you are clever, Sammy.

413
00:20:48,896 --> 00:20:51,515
I have to completely give it up to you man.

414
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,233
I was surprised.

415
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:55,852
And that's a rare thing.

416
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:58,537
- Congrats.
- I am not here for props.

417
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:01,450
I think you have to do
something for me now.

418
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:03,168
Oh, is that so?

419
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:05,026
You want your soul back?

420
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:08,785
You think you can defeat me in a contest?

421
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:11,639
What would that contest entail?

422
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,641
Who is better at slacking off?

423
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:14,772
Who can be the biggest failure?

424
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,439
Just what exactly is it that you can beat me at, Sammy?

425
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,991
Because we both know the
only thing that you really excel at

426
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:22,886
is being a full time looser.

427
00:21:28,273 --> 00:21:31,576
Really? A drinking contest?

428
00:21:31,948 --> 00:21:35,146
Oh, you are even dumber than
I thought, buddy boy.

429
00:21:35,147 --> 00:21:37,083
I can't get drunk!

430
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,420
The game is quarters.

431
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:43,353
I'm kinda awesome at it.

432
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,965
Five shots, most in wins, questions?

433
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:50,355
Nope.

434
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:52,061
After you.

435
00:22:13,658 --> 00:22:15,611
Five for five.

436
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:18,700
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

437
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:22,165
- A little unusual for you.
- Stop stalling and shoot.

438
00:22:28,342 --> 00:22:30,037
You know something, Sammy?

439
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:33,610
I feel I owe you an apology.

440
00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:37,445
Sometimes I underestimate you.

441
00:22:37,446 --> 00:22:39,135
And that's unfair.

442
00:22:40,612 --> 00:22:42,975
I just assume you are going to mess up.

443
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:46,837
But you know what they say
about the word "assume"

444
00:22:46,838 --> 00:22:50,598
It makes and ass out of you and on occasion...

445
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,514
me.

446
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,812
Man am I relieved!

447
00:23:02,813 --> 00:23:05,354
You know, this is my first time doing this.

448
00:23:05,355 --> 00:23:07,278
I am really a little impressed with myself.

449
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,814
All right fine, first round is a tie. Round two. I go first.

450
00:23:10,815 --> 00:23:12,863
Oh, I don't think so.

451
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:16,947
There is no second round.
You had your contest.

452
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:19,395
It ended in a draw,
end of story.

453
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:21,171
No! Somebody has to win.

454
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:23,715
Right. You have to win.

455
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:26,119
And you didn't. And that's all she wrote.

456
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,739
You only get one shot out of that.

457
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,615
Didn't you read the fine print on the incantation?

458
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,187
- That's not fair!
- Oh, sure it is.

459
00:23:32,188 --> 00:23:34,745
You had a chance to win,
you made a valiant effort.

460
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,825
But let's be honest.
I'm damned good.

461
00:23:41,346 --> 00:23:43,423
Oh hey, come on, don't feel so bad.

462
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:45,714
I just don't have a reason to compete
with you anymore.

463
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,774
I already own you.

464
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:50,038
Now if you feel you had
something to make it worth my while

465
00:23:50,706 --> 00:23:52,549
I may give you a rematch.

466
00:23:55,872 --> 00:23:57,338
If you think of anything,

467
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:59,116
you let me know.

468
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:03,485
'Night.

469
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,120
Ok! Mission accomplished.

470
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:21,546
So what did you guys get?

471
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:23,535
Everything I made for my grandmother.

472
00:24:23,536 --> 00:24:25,950
This ashtray I made in fourth grade.

473
00:24:26,485 --> 00:24:29,182
This Christmas ornaments I did in third grade.

474
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:33,222
And this hand turkeys, I made
ever since I was two years old

475
00:24:33,311 --> 00:24:35,931
- What did you get Sock?
- DVD player.

476
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,189
Ben's favorite childhood DVD Player.
It's very sentimental

477
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:45,560
- You feel better now?
- Yeah.

478
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:48,152
She's not the only one that can
hit where it hurts.

479
00:24:49,492 --> 00:24:50,257
This is wrong.

480
00:24:50,258 --> 00:24:52,271
- This is all wrong.
- What are you talking about?

481
00:24:52,272 --> 00:24:54,435
I can't be the one that tears
you apart from you family.

482
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:56,855
- No you are not!
- I am going to do the exorcism.

483
00:24:56,856 --> 00:24:57,959
You can't do that. Is too dangerous!

484
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,116
No is not. Nothing can happen to me.

485
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:01,516
I am not afraid of that priest.

486
00:25:01,517 --> 00:25:03,864
I'll just.... fake it!

487
00:25:04,074 --> 00:25:06,399
I'll yell and I'll scream ' "Aahh!

488
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,458
You know so they think that
the demon just flew out of me.

489
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:10,801
So it won't actually not work?

490
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:12,935
So you are not going to get hurt, right?

491
00:25:12,936 --> 00:25:14,434
I'll be fine.

492
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:15,867
Oh, oh, hold on!

493
00:25:15,868 --> 00:25:18,930
This thing plays Blu Ray. We have to
go back and get the flattie

494
00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:26,290
Hey! Look who I've found.

495
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,706
You found Gladys?

496
00:25:29,707 --> 00:25:31,715
Yeah! I paid her to translate the demon's scroll

497
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:33,074
so you can get out of your deal!

498
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:35,824
Yeah the meter is running.
So let's get the show on the road.

499
00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:37,957
What? What's wrong?

500
00:25:41,845 --> 00:25:43,933
That was it. That was my chance.

501
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:45,536
I had the devil right where I wanted him,

502
00:25:45,537 --> 00:25:47,626
and I let him slip through my fingers.

503
00:25:47,627 --> 00:25:49,329
I am right back where I started from.

504
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,143
I am screwed.

505
00:25:50,144 --> 00:25:51,609
No, still does not explain the suit.

506
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,213
You look like Justin Timberlake took a dump.

507
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:58,206
Steve gave the suit to me after
he translated the scroll.

508
00:25:58,207 --> 00:25:59,983
He say that I have to dress like the devil.

509
00:25:59,984 --> 00:26:02,339
I have to reflect his appearance in order to beat him.

510
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,651
What? It doesn't say that.
It doesn't say reflect the devil.

511
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:10,892
It says the devil's reflection.
The devil's vanity is his weakness.

512
00:26:10,893 --> 00:26:12,204
What you should have done

513
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:14,802
is take a big mirror with you to the competition.

514
00:26:14,803 --> 00:26:16,773
You know like a distraction.

515
00:26:16,774 --> 00:26:19,582
The devil can't resist looking at himself.

516
00:26:19,706 --> 00:26:21,841
Well that doesn't do me any good now, does it?...

517
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:23,788
There must be a way to challenge him again.

518
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:26,382
No. He said I have to make it worth his while

519
00:26:26,383 --> 00:26:28,189
I got nothing to give him.

520
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,580
I need another drink...

521
00:26:31,983 --> 00:26:36,197
Steve, what a dope.
I always knew he couldn’t read.

522
00:26:37,705 --> 00:26:39,453
Gladys, I need a favor.

523
00:26:39,566 --> 00:26:42,464
I'm not making out with you!

524
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,756
All right.

525
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:46,847
I'll make out with you.

526
00:26:50,348 --> 00:26:52,391
How do I get a meeting with the devil?

527
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:59,654
Hey, are you sure about this?

528
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,723
Because you do not have to...

529
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:02,745
- Yes I am sure.
- OK.

530
00:27:02,862 --> 00:27:04,991
- Hi, mijo.
- Hey grandma.

531
00:27:04,992 --> 00:27:06,790
You remember father O'Malley?

532
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,629
- Hello.
- Hi.

533
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,371
Can I get you anything?
A soda, water?

534
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,868
Eh, no, I am fine, thank you.

535
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:14,634
I would love a beer.

536
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:17,283
What? Father's
going to knock this out

537
00:27:17,284 --> 00:27:19,018
no problem, right father?

538
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:23,244
I can't make any promises
but I hope too, yes.

539
00:27:24,136 --> 00:27:25,924
So Nina, why don't you and I head upstairs?

540
00:27:25,925 --> 00:27:29,217
- and we can start it, shall we?
- OK.

541
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:50,995
"Dear Ben,

542
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:52,806
I want you to know how much I love you

543
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:55,801
and how special these last few months with you have been

544
00:27:55,802 --> 00:27:57,298
But I lied.

545
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,651
There is a good chance that this exorcism will work,

546
00:27:59,652 --> 00:28:02,428
and if that happens I will be sent back to hell.

547
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:05,042
I am sorry I did not tell you this was a possibility

548
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:07,404
but ultimately I couldn't accept the fact

549
00:28:07,405 --> 00:28:10,947
that I was the reason you were no longer part of your family

550
00:28:10,948 --> 00:28:12,791
and if we never see each other again,

551
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:15,397
I will think about you every day.

552
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:17,689
Love always, Nina.

553
00:28:30,854 --> 00:28:32,465
All right don't you worry kiddies

554
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:34,876
Sock's on his way gonna save your asses!

555
00:28:34,877 --> 00:28:36,409
Here we go!

556
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,495
Is hot here!

557
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,759
Oh, what is going on?

558
00:28:52,508 --> 00:28:54,456
What's happening?! Come on!

559
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:04,464
Hi.

560
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:07,171
Mind if I have a second with her?

561
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:09,020
Certainly.

562
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:14,754
- Hey.
- Hey.

563
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:17,609
So, put on a good show, all right?.

564
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,139
- OK.
- All right.

565
00:29:20,435 --> 00:29:22,586
- Ben, wait.
- Yeah?

566
00:29:23,946 --> 00:29:26,952
- I love you.
- Oh, that's sweet.

567
00:29:28,514 --> 00:29:30,305
Break a leg you two!

568
00:29:39,827 --> 00:29:41,252
OK!

569
00:29:47,848 --> 00:29:49,123
OK.

570
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,746
Are you tripping out?

571
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,793
Oh, is nobody else in the car...

572
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:57,694
Is it you, Sam... no...

573
00:30:01,852 --> 00:30:03,164
No way!

574
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,133
You are not going to stop me! No way nannie.

575
00:30:15,025 --> 00:30:19,081
Oh, her magic is strong!
my caddie is gone there!

576
00:30:22,936 --> 00:30:25,396
Die, you pint size witch!

577
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,884
Most glorious prince of the heavenly armies,

578
00:30:31,885 --> 00:30:34,898
Michael the archangel defend us

579
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:38,938
In our battle against the rulers of the darkness

580
00:30:42,354 --> 00:30:43,947
Why so dry.

581
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:48,975
my mouth is so draaaaaaaaaaaahy...

582
00:30:51,591 --> 00:30:53,056
who the hell?

583
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,603
Gooood!

584
00:30:58,597 --> 00:31:02,124
The blood of the martyrs come after you

585
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,051
Sounds like is going pretty well.

586
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:07,081
I'll get it.

587
00:31:09,515 --> 00:31:10,656
Sock!

588
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,786
Something is happening with my mouth!

589
00:31:13,787 --> 00:31:14,493
What?

590
00:31:14,494 --> 00:31:16,471
Nina!

591
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:22,600
Sock, Sock, hey Sock...

592
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,328
Hell spawn, the blood of the martyrs compels it!

593
00:31:30,002 --> 00:31:32,155
In the name of God! Ah!

594
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:34,504
Who are you?

595
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,960
Menudo.

596
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:37,645
Benjamin, get him out of here!

597
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,539
No, no, no!

598
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:50,826
Ben, Nina loves you so much,

599
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,903
and she will love you forever!

600
00:31:55,495 --> 00:31:57,661
Hey guys I think is gone!

601
00:31:58,692 --> 00:32:00,047
Well, how do you feel?

602
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:02,800
I feel good. I think you should worry
about him.

603
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:04,591
I think that the demon jumped.

604
00:32:10,188 --> 00:32:14,041
Oh so now it resides in this poor men,
does it?

605
00:32:14,771 --> 00:32:18,282
If you want to dance demon,
you'll dance with me.

606
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:22,037
Sorry Sock...

607
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:29,356
I need your opinion Sammy.

608
00:32:29,506 --> 00:32:32,930
On my lapel which you think makes my eyes pop more?

609
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,825
Carnation or Lily?

610
00:32:36,277 --> 00:32:37,805
I know ... both are right

611
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:40,941
That is the beauty of wearing a dark suit
and having this face.

612
00:32:41,743 --> 00:32:42,986
Go away.

613
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:45,745
Oh, why the big frown?

614
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,898
I thought you'd be on cloud nine.

615
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:51,409
- Why would you think that?
- You and me, quarters rematch.

616
00:32:51,974 --> 00:32:53,515
Is all set up.

617
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:56,087
You didn't know?

618
00:32:56,088 --> 00:32:57,323
What are you talking about?

619
00:32:57,324 --> 00:32:59,627
Someone made it worth my while.

620
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:01,468
So the contest is back on.

621
00:33:01,469 --> 00:33:05,059
- Someone? Who?
- Your girl. Andi.

622
00:33:06,257 --> 00:33:08,518
She put up her own soul as collateral.

623
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,781
She must be really into you.
You are a lucky guy.

624
00:33:19,925 --> 00:33:21,614
Tell me you didn't do it.

625
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,591
Yeah, I-I kinda did.

626
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:27,263
Andi... what were you thinking?

627
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:29,709
I was thinking that I want you out of your deal.

628
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,848
This is the only way to do it.

629
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:33,255
No you have to stop it. You have to go back to the devil

630
00:33:33,256 --> 00:33:35,216
and tell him that you changed your mind.

631
00:33:35,217 --> 00:33:36,612
No.

632
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,461
No, I want to do it.

633
00:33:38,462 --> 00:33:40,296
I need to do this.

634
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,095
I believe in you.

635
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:45,156
And I believe that you can beat him.

636
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:47,277
And I am tired of being alone.

637
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:49,837
- Aren't you?
- Is too much to risk.

638
00:33:49,838 --> 00:33:52,066
Well is my risk to take.

639
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:56,932
We are going to beat the devil, Sam!

640
00:33:57,933 --> 00:33:59,395
I know it.

641
00:33:59,396 --> 00:34:00,973
Come on.

642
00:34:08,196 --> 00:34:10,790
- You're nervous?
- Yeah. Are you?

643
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:12,539
Oh yeah.

644
00:34:14,003 --> 00:34:15,605
This is for the lady's file.

645
00:34:15,606 --> 00:34:19,380
Is not every day that I get to win such a
beautiful trophy

646
00:34:19,381 --> 00:34:21,148
Yeah, we'll see about that

647
00:34:22,392 --> 00:34:24,621
I'm already liking the woman's touch.

648
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:27,990
Very nice Andi, well it spruces the place up

649
00:34:27,991 --> 00:34:29,785
Sam, get this over with.

650
00:34:29,786 --> 00:34:31,830
Yeah, Sammy.

651
00:34:32,318 --> 00:34:34,389
Let's do get this over with.

652
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,893
There is something else Andi
brought to the party.

653
00:34:39,866 --> 00:34:42,318
This time I think you should go first.

654
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,223
Now I know you are the brains
of this operation.

655
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,968
Your turn.

656
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,882
Sam, you just have to get two in.
You got this.

657
00:35:44,205 --> 00:35:46,309
I am a bad looser. All right?

658
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,274
Make you sure, if you eventually win this thing

659
00:35:48,275 --> 00:35:50,300
don't expect any hugs or grab ass.

660
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:52,913
There are shot glasses in the housewere.
I will be right back.

661
00:35:57,737 --> 00:35:58,988
Hey buddy.

662
00:35:59,503 --> 00:36:01,795
Steve, hey. What are you doing here.

663
00:36:01,796 --> 00:36:06,116
I heard some bonehead screwed up
an ancient translation.

664
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,070
Guilty.

665
00:36:07,071 --> 00:36:08,436
Ah, don't worry about it man.

666
00:36:08,437 --> 00:36:10,680
Do you have any
idea what a Mensch you are?

667
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:11,990
Thanks, listen I gotta go.

668
00:36:11,991 --> 00:36:13,442
I am about to get out my deal with the devil.

669
00:36:13,443 --> 00:36:16,002
I know. I heard.

670
00:36:16,187 --> 00:36:20,217
And let me just say how truly, deeply

671
00:36:20,654 --> 00:36:22,448
sorry I am.

672
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:25,084
Sorry for what?

673
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,164
Sam, I'm so sorry.

674
00:36:32,653 --> 00:36:33,788
Why?

675
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:36,431
Is for the best. That's all I know.

676
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:44,068
Oh, my God!

677
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,445
Sam, what happened?

678
00:36:45,446 --> 00:36:46,912
- Is broken.
- What?!

679
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,974
- How?
- Can't talk about it right now.

680
00:36:49,234 --> 00:36:50,841
Hey, Sammy, come on,
if you want to forfeit,

681
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,010
All you have to do, is say so.

682
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:53,384
No.

683
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:55,274
No forfeit.

684
00:37:02,777 --> 00:37:06,130
Oh, man. That's pathetic, come on.

685
00:37:06,131 --> 00:37:09,066
Just stop right now. Please.
For your own sake.

686
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:11,541
I still have one good hand.

687
00:37:17,889 --> 00:37:19,389
You are not leftie, eh?

688
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,963
Shut up.

689
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:30,574
Oh, this is hard to watch.

690
00:37:51,415 --> 00:37:52,899
So...

691
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:56,581
Let's just take a survey who had the worst week

692
00:37:57,823 --> 00:37:59,820
I lost my soul to the devil.

693
00:38:00,013 --> 00:38:01,492
Top that.

694
00:38:03,205 --> 00:38:05,410
An angel broke my hand is six places.

695
00:38:05,411 --> 00:38:07,127
which evidently means, heaven hates me.

696
00:38:07,128 --> 00:38:08,917
and the devil still owns my soul.

697
00:38:08,918 --> 00:38:11,259
Ok, let's recap for Sock.

698
00:38:11,901 --> 00:38:13,691
I got frog roofied.

699
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:16,768
My mouth is like sand.
My mind is melting.

700
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:18,526
I tasted music

701
00:38:18,527 --> 00:38:20,789
and it tasted like garbage.

702
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,335
I had a pretty good week.

703
00:38:25,629 --> 00:38:26,447
What?

704
00:38:26,448 --> 00:38:28,989
Sock saved my girlfriend from going back to hell.

705
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,424
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

706
00:38:30,425 --> 00:38:32,300
I really hate your grandmother.

707
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:33,970
- I know.
- Yeah.

708
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,511
Let me get fruit on my pancakes.

709
00:38:37,669 --> 00:38:39,207
- Sure.
- Whipped cream, maybe.

710
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,540
Sure.

711
00:38:43,705 --> 00:38:45,669
Ahhh so..

712
00:38:46,748 --> 00:38:50,161
I am really sorry that your soul got
damned for eternity

713
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,186
That’s... that's a bummer.

714
00:38:52,187 --> 00:38:54,528
- Let's... Come here.
- Thanks Sock.

715
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:01,140
I'm sorry.

716
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:02,499
Thank you, Ben.

717
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,098
Shotgun.

718
00:39:06,632 --> 00:39:09,768
Look Andi I want you to know
I feel terrible

719
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:11,832
about what happened.
You put yourself on the line,

720
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:15,496
put your soul on the line.
And I let you down.

721
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:17,708
I don't expect you to forgive me.

722
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:20,103
I... just .... only hope that...

723
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:34,576
- What was that about?
- The devil owns my soul,

724
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:37,616
But I don't...

725
00:39:38,582 --> 00:39:41,080
feel any different, you know?

726
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:44,654
And I still love you more than
I ever did.

727
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,050
And as bad as things seem...

728
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:50,396
I'm...

729
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:52,917
really happy.

730
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:57,546
- Is that weird?
- Yes, completely.

731
00:39:57,547 --> 00:39:59,810
We can still try to get out of our
deals with the devil.

732
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:02,107
And we can try to change our fates

733
00:40:02,512 --> 00:40:05,133
You did it once before,
and we can try again.

734
00:40:05,517 --> 00:40:08,778
You know if nothing else then... we have time together.

735
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:10,673
Then I am happy too.

736
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:15,958
Then I am happy too.

737
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:19,730
Steve, what do you want?

738
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:21,491
I thought I heard you over say you are happy.

739
00:40:21,492 --> 00:40:23,488
I figured it would be a good time to poke in.

740
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:24,877
Get out!

741
00:40:24,878 --> 00:40:26,690
Look, I'm not exactly pleased

742
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:28,826
With the way things turned out either, but I just...

743
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:30,529
Hey, Ow!

744
00:40:31,322 --> 00:40:32,662
Andi, are you throwing rocks at me?

745
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,506
Yes, I am trying to break your hand

746
00:40:34,507 --> 00:40:37,033
Hey, Sam, would you please tell
her to quit it.

747
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:40,236
Ow! Would you let me explain?!

748
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,468
Fine, fine, explain.
What is your explanation?

749
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:45,483
I'm acting from.. on orders
from upstairs.

750
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:48,614
I don't know exactly why
they had me do

751
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:50,228
the things that they had me do.

752
00:40:50,229 --> 00:40:52,424
Guys! Stop! Stop!

753
00:40:52,425 --> 00:40:54,075
You've every right to be upset.

754
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:57,324
But throwing rocks is never constructive.

755
00:40:57,568 --> 00:40:59,412
Enough!

756
00:41:01,764 --> 00:41:04,167
Yeah I got my wings earlier today.

757
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:06,386
I wanted it to be a surprise.

758
00:41:06,387 --> 00:41:09,369
You got your wings because you broke my hand?

759
00:41:09,503 --> 00:41:11,657
That's great. Congratulations.

760
00:41:11,658 --> 00:41:13,588
Is because of how I helped you.

761
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:15,139
Helped?

762
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:17,458
The devil owns both of our souls.

763
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:20,299
Heaven works in mysterious ways, Andi.

764
00:41:20,721 --> 00:41:23,543
- You got to believe.
- Believe what?

765
00:41:23,888 --> 00:41:25,747
That you are not alone.
