1
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:24,500
Three weeks in a row that you guys
have been late. I'm standing here

2
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:26,553
with empty ATMs
and a staff that I certainly

3
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:29,350
have to pay overtime cause you are...
what's the word? Late.

4
00:01:33,374 --> 00:01:34,796
That's just one example, Henry.

5
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,434
The truth is, I can go on all day.

6
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:40,702
Rocco, please, will you do me a favor
and stop with the storytelling

7
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:44,215
and maybe finish up rewiring or
whatever you're actually doing up there?

8
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:47,747
Mr. Shelton, this is the exact point
I was just making to Henry here.

9
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:50,109
Everyone's so damn
pissed off all the time.

10
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,532
Look, Rocco,

11
00:01:51,937 --> 00:01:56,241
I have got mismatched money counts
and a sour stomach, okay?

12
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,161
Okay,
all's I'm saying is we gotta be careful.

13
00:01:59,303 --> 00:02:02,208
Take heed.
Tribal lines are being drawn everywhere.

14
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:18,140
- Morning, Mr. Shelton.
- Hey, Karen, how are you?

15
00:02:30,387 --> 00:02:32,904
- You guys done?
- Yeah. Here's my figure, Mr. Shelton.

16
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,745
And my count, sir.

17
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:37,985
Oh, they match.
Excellent.

18
00:02:38,102 --> 00:02:40,235
It's been a long day,
take a ten minutes break.

19
00:03:00,744 --> 00:03:01,749
Come on, come on.

20
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:16,895
Hey, Bernard.
Hi, Abe.

21
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:18,876
Karen.

22
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,883
If you've control of the account,
then I don't have the information.

23
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:28,662
Everybody get down!

24
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,124
Down!
Everybody down!

25
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:37,828
- Put the hands up!
- Nobody move!

26
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:40,685
Get down!
Sit, now!

27
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:41,943
Don't move.

28
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:44,393
Keep the fingers away from there!

29
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,454
Keep the fingers away from the button.

30
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,731
Don't move your hands.

31
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:50,501
There you go, get on the floor.
That's it. Thank you.

32
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:52,050
Stay right there.

33
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:54,153
Mr. Piggy, you forgetting something?

34
00:04:54,322 --> 00:04:55,336
I got it.

35
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,552
Come on, man.
All right...

36
00:04:58,012 --> 00:04:59,162
Stay down, just relax.

37
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:01,408
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

38
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:03,872
as you rightfully assumed,
this is a bank robbery, okay?

39
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:06,434
All I'm asking you is to sit still

40
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:08,274
and breathe and be silent, okay?

41
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,858
The last thing I wanna do
is hurt anybody.

42
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,397
I implore you not to stand up and dance.
'Cause we don't wanna hurt you!

43
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,018
All we want is the money.
You can understand that, right?

44
00:05:17,146 --> 00:05:19,377
With inflation?
That's all we want is the money.

45
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:20,872
I bet you can understand that.

46
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:22,547
Didn't I tell you not to move?

47
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:28,895
Keep your hands down!

48
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:31,389
That's it. That's it, everybody.

49
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:32,418
Don't move!

50
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:35,438
Just follow these simple instructions

51
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:37,527
and we can all walk out of here
safe and sound.

52
00:05:37,647 --> 00:05:38,999
You got that?
Okay.

53
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:42,228
Now, Abe Shelton,
please reveal yourself.

54
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:44,849
Abe Shelton.

55
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:47,568
Come on, Abe.

56
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:49,753
Abe-ey, where are you?
Come on.

57
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:53,532
Rabbit, can you find him please?

58
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:55,581
Oh, here he is!

59
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,390
Keys, now.
Come on!

60
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:05,775
Down!

61
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:06,996
Mouse, go!

62
00:06:34,663 --> 00:06:36,137
All right, you're doing great.

63
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:37,555
That's it.
That's good.

64
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:40,118
The more calm you are, the more calm
we stay. You got that?

65
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:49,555
<i>All units, robbery in progress.</i>

66
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:55,235
- Yeah?
- Sarge, this scanner's blowing up.

67
00:06:56,297 --> 00:06:57,451
<i>Cops are on route.</i>

68
00:06:57,574 --> 00:06:59,179
You got about two minutes.

69
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:04,767
Mr. Cat, Mr. Pig.

70
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:06,579
The call's in.
Cops're on route.

71
00:07:06,824 --> 00:07:08,223
We got a solid two.

72
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:16,511
Don't get excited,
we're still in control. You got that?

73
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:19,253
Don't try to be smart, guy, all right?

74
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:20,962
That's it.
We're good.

75
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:23,469
Stay calm. It's all...
it's all good.

76
00:07:24,202 --> 00:07:26,136
Hold it.
We gotta go back.

77
00:07:27,123 --> 00:07:29,010
Damn it, I dropped my cell.

78
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:41,850
Come on!
Did you hear me?

79
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:43,597
Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Mouse, are we good?

80
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,133
- Very good, Mr. Wolf!
- Come on, move it, man! Move it!

81
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,781
Thank you people,
for your time and cooperation.

82
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,885
Let's never do this again.
Come on, fellas.

83
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:01,011
Walk away.

84
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:08,240
Go go go, move!

85
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:23,327
Gun!

86
00:08:57,112 --> 00:08:58,614
There's an exit in back!

87
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:00,079
Come on!
Go out the back!

88
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:07,559
There's an exit in the back.

89
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:05,272
Fall back!
Fall back!

90
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:44,192
Daddy, they're shooting people.

91
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,394
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on, boss.

92
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:52,595
Scotty.

93
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:00,981
Don't worry.

94
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:04,539
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

95
00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:05,966
I got you.

96
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,027
Secure the doors, somebody!

97
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,863
Keys!
Who's got the keys?

98
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:17,628
You, give me the keys!

99
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,159
Give me those keys!

100
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:23,562
Rabbit, secure the back!

101
00:11:24,773 --> 00:11:25,787
Got it.

102
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:10,780
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm really sorry, but this is now

103
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:13,400
a hostage situation.
Now, I need you to follow orders.

104
00:12:13,992 --> 00:12:16,799
I promise you bad things won't happen
to you. I can guarantee that.

105
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,673
Now, Mr. Piggy's gonna secure you
into the center of the room.

106
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:21,616
Please follow.
You got that?

107
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:23,738
Go ahead, move!
Everybody move!

108
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:25,228
You!
Up, over there!

109
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:26,806
Go! Go!

110
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,388
Ladies, up!
Move!

111
00:12:29,904 --> 00:12:31,162
Come on, move it!

112
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:34,252
Don't say a word or I won't hesitate
to put a bullet in your brain!

113
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,064
Silence is golden!

114
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:38,149
You, up!
Come on, get up!

115
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:40,909
Go, go.
Get down!

116
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,557
Move.
Come on, come on.

117
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:51,172
Get your legs in.
Get your legs in.

118
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:53,200
Get down.
Get down.

119
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,153
Get your legs in.

120
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:57,153
We're good, Mr. Wolf!

121
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:07,368
How bad is it?

122
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:09,105
It's okay.
It went

123
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:11,856
right through,
but the lady, she's bad, man.

124
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:14,663
You need to help her.
Just help her. Just help her.

125
00:13:15,612 --> 00:13:17,245
Okay?
Go help her.

126
00:13:18,907 --> 00:13:19,997
It's gonna be fine.

127
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:26,964
- All right?
- Yeah.

128
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:30,748
How's she doing?

129
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:33,940
Bullet went right through her airway.
She's gonna need a trache.

130
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:36,222
And I'll tourniquet that leg
if she makes it.

131
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:39,790
Sarge, I'm gonna need a pen
off that desk over there.

132
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,134
I'll hold her.

133
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:51,058
Thanks.
Support her head.

134
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,584
Good work, man.

135
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:22,936
Nothing to it.

136
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:31,800
How's she doing?

137
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,513
You don't have to worry anymore.
She's stable.

138
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:37,199
Yeah, but she needs a hospital ASAP.

139
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:41,124
Hey, Rabbit, did you secure the back?

140
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:43,274
The best I could, Mr. Wolf.

141
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,480
What happens now?

142
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,657
I can hear you
through the goddamn walls, Aug.

143
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:08,421
You sound
like a trumpet filled with mucus.

144
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:09,568
There you go, John Boy.

145
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:11,699
You guys need backup clips, remember.

146
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:13,979
I never heard of
adult-onset snoring before, man.

147
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:15,820
Hey, Hawke, you're short
a concussion grenade.

148
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:17,102
My father snored,

149
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:19,234
his father snored, I snore.

150
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:21,769
I'm just a late bloomer.
What about

151
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,633
those little presents you leave us
in the bathtub, Hawke, huh?

152
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:26,708
You're shedding
like a yeti in the Sahara.

153
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:28,464
I have a spare concussion.
Take mine.

154
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:29,806
Tool up!

155
00:15:29,937 --> 00:15:32,548
He's right, Hawkeye.
It's like we're living with a wookiee.

156
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,059
Maybe you should wear a hairnet.

157
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,121
- It's only right.
- Put your domestic problems aside,

158
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:39,346
SWAT-ties, and saddle up.
Let's go.

159
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:41,544
All right, here's the skinny.

160
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,356
We got multiple HTs inside.

161
00:15:43,496 --> 00:15:45,994
Hostage count unknown.
I need these perimeter streets

162
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:47,562
cleared and these buildings evac-ed.

163
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:50,304
They got clear lines of sight
and low ballistic winds.

164
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:55,036
I didn't know sniping required
personal grooming tools, Q.

165
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:58,201
This here looks like the big one.
And I'm the face of the squad.

166
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:00,351
This here's like ancient Rome,
and I'm the black Maximus.

167
00:16:00,773 --> 00:16:01,900
So I got to look good.

168
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,318
Blaximus.

169
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,609
- Gluteus Maximus.
- All right, enough!

170
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,420
Where's my skinny freak Tonray?

171
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:09,289
Hey, I'm here.
Yes, I'm here...

172
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,792
hi, here.
Hey, Hawke.

173
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:13,486
- Go to hell, Tonray.
- Calm your nerves, Tonray.

174
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,792
Christ, you're making me nervous.

175
00:16:15,787 --> 00:16:18,115
All right, look, I need
complete communication breakdown.

176
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:21,383
Scare 'em into submission.
Nothing but the TV.

177
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:24,623
I only want them to see
our army, all right?

178
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:26,725
Where's our advanced op gonna be, Lou?

179
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:27,974
We'll figure it out

180
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:30,114
- when Cap gets here.
- How about

181
00:16:30,237 --> 00:16:32,725
that donut shop, Lieutenant?
Or is that too cliched?

182
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:34,012
- Please.
- Excuse me.

183
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:37,063
Please don't put our operations base
in a donut shop.

184
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,401
I'm the anti-donut cop these days, Cap.

185
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,251
- Why is that?
- Margie's got me

186
00:16:41,374 --> 00:16:44,275
on some Madonna-inspired
microbiotic malnutrition diet.

187
00:16:44,397 --> 00:16:46,116
And I gotta keep up or the sex stops.

188
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,407
I'd swap a titty
for a tater tot right about now.

189
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:51,083
- Well, at least you're getting some.
- Damn, how long has it been?

190
00:16:51,431 --> 00:16:53,947
About a month. She's not even due
for another five. You believe that?

191
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:56,172
I can talk a hungry fat man
out of a candy shop,

192
00:16:56,294 --> 00:16:58,961
but I can't even talk my way
into my wife's panties.

193
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:01,712
Send her some flowers.
Always works for me.

194
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:04,021
It's gotta work better
than sending her chocolates.

195
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:05,843
We got schematics on the bank
and all surrounding buildings?

196
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:08,716
Yes, schematics are en route
as we speak.

197
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:10,529
And Captain Cali, I just wanna say

198
00:17:10,651 --> 00:17:13,139
how nice it's to work with you again.
It's a pleasure to be here

199
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:15,158
to assist and support
in all ways possible.

200
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,754
- What is his name again?
- Tonray.

201
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:19,064
I need 2 things from you.
Kissing my ass isn't one of 'em.

202
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:22,229
First of all, follow instructions.
Second, when you speak to me,

203
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:23,863
speak proper English.

204
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:27,365
Don't sweat it, Tonray.

205
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:29,731
I started a sentence
with "But" the other day,

206
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:31,243
and didn't hear the end of it.

207
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,375
Rightfully so.

208
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:35,342
One misplaced word can cost lives
in what we do. Remember that.

209
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,483
How about that place?

210
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:40,186
You up to speed on all of this?

211
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:44,394
For the most part.
Multiple perps, bank robbery gone bad.

212
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:46,244
Holed up tightly.
And...

213
00:17:47,577 --> 00:17:50,122
I assume you are Marcos.
A pleasure to meet you.

214
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:51,982
We're gonna be taking over your place.

215
00:17:52,611 --> 00:17:54,273
Hey, people,

216
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:57,550
we need to stop being scared
and figure out what we're gonna do here.

217
00:17:57,673 --> 00:18:00,555
B- be quiet.
They told us not to talk.

218
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:03,813
So? I'm not gonna
blindly listen to what they say.

219
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:05,231
Screw that.
Come on.

220
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:07,888
Abe's right.
Let's just sit here.

221
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:11,898
That picky bastard's just looking
for an excuse to bust someone up again.

222
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:13,118
Henry?

223
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,545
Henry, you okay?

224
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:15,709
Yeah.

225
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:17,512
I'm s-sorry.

226
00:18:19,456 --> 00:18:21,006
Hey, man, you okay?

227
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:23,250
Yeah, I'm all right now.

228
00:18:23,522 --> 00:18:25,578
I'm just saying, we can't do nothing.

229
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,714
I got a kid here.

230
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:28,216
You're scaring him with this talk.

231
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,479
Hey, hold on.
I agree with the girl.

232
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:32,282
Who knows what they're capable of?

233
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:34,414
We need to think of ways
of saving our own asses.

234
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:36,104
Do whatever you want,
just keep us out of it.

235
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:37,709
What about her?

236
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,577
She's in shock or something.

237
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,441
All right, just listen to me, okay?

238
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:44,413
At some point,
they're gonna kill one of us

239
00:18:44,544 --> 00:18:46,873
to show cops that they're
for real, all right?

240
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:48,892
And I'm not waiting
for anything like that to happen.

241
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:53,668
I hear one more thing, I'm gonna come
over there and start tearing things up!

242
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:56,200
No talking!

243
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,010
Man.

244
00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:10,134
What the hell did we get
ourselves into?

245
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,016
- We're screwed.
- Yeah, well, I thought we'd be counting

246
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:15,116
our cut right about now, hmm?
Not holded up with hostages.

247
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:18,275
But that's the way it shook down.
So we're gonna do what we do best.

248
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:20,393
- We're gonna deal with it.
- You kidding me? Come on, man.

249
00:19:20,776 --> 00:19:22,759
We shot cops, all right?
All right, we had a deal.

250
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,432
No one gets hurt.

251
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:27,615
- All right, just calm down.
- No, look, I just wanna go home.

252
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:30,338
I know, man, I know. But we gotta
keep control of the situation, okay?

253
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:33,091
We're in this here now.
And we're in this thing together, okay?

254
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:37,533
Unless any one of you doesn't
wanna play this through.

255
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:38,524
Just let me know, man.

256
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,783
We've been through hell
and back together,

257
00:19:39,784 --> 00:19:41,520
but if you wanna step outside
and call it a day,

258
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:42,700
just let me know.

259
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,245
Come on, Sarge.
You know us better than that.

260
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:49,146
You saved my life.
Our lives.

261
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,906
You think I'm gonna walk
out of here without you?

262
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:54,868
I don't got anybody else but you.

263
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:58,093
I know I speak for my brother
when I say we stay with you.

264
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:00,426
We stay in the trenches with you.

265
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:05,270
- Hell, yeah, he speaks for me, Sarge.
- I'm with you.

266
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,180
- I'm with you too, Sarge.
- Yeah, I know, man. I know.

267
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:13,267
But no matter how hard we try
to keep it clean, it might get nasty.

268
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:16,572
- Are you with that?
- Yeah, if you're here, I'm here.

269
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:19,783
Right on... I'll buck with you. I'll
buck with all you guys till the end.

270
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,455
All right, then.

271
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,691
I've sacrificed too much to spend
any time behind bars.

272
00:20:26,796 --> 00:20:30,326
I'm riding with my brothers.
Backing down is not in my blood.

273
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,173
All right, man, so we go

274
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,801
all the way together,
no matter what it takes.

275
00:20:38,782 --> 00:20:40,831
Big guns are on the scene.

276
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:44,859
All right, this is it, fellas.

277
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:47,216
We gotta secure the perimeter
before they do.

278
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:50,522
Cat, Mouse, hit the back room. Seal all
doorways in case of a smokeout.

279
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,991
I'm gonna set up and look
for coordinate fire lines.

280
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,192
Mr. Pig, Mr. Rabbit,
you're on hostage guard.

281
00:20:55,193 --> 00:20:56,689
Collecall computers and phones.

282
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,994
We gotta burrow in deep
or we're done. Go go go go!

283
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:00,163
On your feet!

284
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,368
You heard him.
Come on, get up, get up!

285
00:21:06,857 --> 00:21:09,273
What you got?
You got anything?

286
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:38,101
Go to the back of the line.
You, get your belt off.

287
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:39,871
What else you got?
You got a phone?

288
00:21:42,724 --> 00:21:44,723
Huh? Anything else?

289
00:21:51,782 --> 00:21:55,764
Take the pills. What do you have?
Phone and the wallet.

290
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,378
Throw it down, right there.
Anything else?

291
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:23,895
All right, here we go.
We're ready.

292
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:26,703
Captain, we're good.

293
00:22:27,957 --> 00:22:29,675
It's ringing.

294
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:48,368
Who is this?

295
00:22:48,487 --> 00:22:51,496
Captain Horst Cali. And you are?

296
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,431
- I'm Wolf. Mr. Wolf.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Wolf.

297
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:00,104
My people tell me you're holed up
pretty tightly in there.

298
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,085
Blocked every exit, every vent.
Impressive.

299
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:06,443
How is everyone?
Anyone injured?

300
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,916
Yeah, we got one.
But she's stabilized.

301
00:23:09,061 --> 00:23:11,529
What about you?
How you doing?

302
00:23:11,661 --> 00:23:15,415
How am I? Just great.
This is one goddamn party for me.

303
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:19,346
Yeah, well,
I like parties myself, Mr. Wolf.

304
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,533
However, I can't say the same

305
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,928
for the 50 or so SWAT team members
surrounding the bank right now.

306
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,289
So what do you say you
and I work together

307
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,638
to prevent them from crashing
the festivities?

308
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,409
Hey, let's just put this on pause, okay?

309
00:23:33,552 --> 00:23:36,530
'Cause if you think you're gonna be
my friend, or my priest, or my analyst

310
00:23:36,657 --> 00:23:39,256
who understands me or gets to know me
so you can talk me down,

311
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:41,216
this is all you need
to understand, okay?

312
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:43,506
I'm the guy with the hostages.
I'm the guy with the gun.

313
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:45,514
I don't want your advice, I don't want
your friendship,

314
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:46,789
I don't want any of that, okay?

315
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:49,793
We're business associates.
Traders trading commodities.

316
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,250
So don't make it personal.

317
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,611
You know, I appreciate
your candor, Mr. Wolf.

318
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:59,801
So tell me, what exactly
do you want from me

319
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,026
in our newly established
business venture?

320
00:24:02,027 --> 00:24:04,512
What do you think I want?
I want my freedom, that's what I want.

321
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:07,438
That's a tall order.
I don't think I can deliver.

322
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,182
Why not? I think it can
be really simple.

323
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:11,421
You just got to focus
on what's more important for you, huh?

324
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:13,278
Jail time for us or the lives
of these people?

325
00:24:13,407 --> 00:24:15,931
Okay, Mr. Wolf.
We're businessmen, remember?

326
00:24:16,036 --> 00:24:18,583
- There's no need to make threats.
- No threat to you, man.

327
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:20,949
You're just over there in your
little cozy operations base.

328
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,021
I was referring to the hostages.

329
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:26,196
As your new business
associate, Mr. Wolf,

330
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,202
it's only fair that I tell you that the
hostages are your only commodity.

331
00:24:30,317 --> 00:24:33,323
The less you have,
the less trading we can do.

332
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:34,987
It's bad business.

333
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,155
Yeah, thanks for the advice.But you know
what, sometimes you have to sacrifice

334
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,185
your main resources
to be taken seriously.

335
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,784
You're being taken
very seriously, Mr. Wolf.

336
00:24:43,268 --> 00:24:46,519
Now, what do you say we kick off our
new venture with a transaction?

337
00:24:46,622 --> 00:24:49,527
We'll call it an introductory endeavor
of good faith.

338
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,111
Start with food, drink?

339
00:24:52,252 --> 00:24:53,909
And what's the cost?

340
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,657
One.

341
00:24:56,336 --> 00:24:59,087
What do you say we get that
injured hostage out of there?

342
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,995
- All right, deal.
- Good.

343
00:25:03,124 --> 00:25:04,395
Just one thing.

344
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,269
My men and I, we've killed before.
We know how to do this.

345
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,852
We made a pact.

346
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:11,924
We're not gonna go to jail,
no matter what. You got that?

347
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:14,574
This thing either ends
with us free or dead.

348
00:25:21,336 --> 00:25:22,743
Formidable?

349
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:24,658
Oh, if he's improvising
he's damn good at it.

350
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:27,488
He thinks fast, as if he's been
in siege situations before.

351
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:29,799
Seems logical, though.
I can use that.

352
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,170
So he is for real?

353
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:34,901
Yeah, unfortunately, I believe
everything Mr. Wolf just said.

354
00:25:35,072 --> 00:25:37,231
- So?
- Let's make the trade.

355
00:25:37,344 --> 00:25:39,233
Then we let them sit and sweat.

356
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:40,568
Yeah.

357
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:08,408
- Watch out. Move out.
- Move out.

358
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:09,988
Here we go, boss.

359
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,198
Found these stashed
in a room upstairs.

360
00:26:12,358 --> 00:26:15,080
- Rabbit to the rescue.
- What do you got?

361
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:18,021
Good work, fellas. Good work.

362
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:21,197
You got two basements? Study
these suckers, 'cause I don't know

363
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,179
if we're gonna leave through
the front or the back.

364
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:27,503
Okay, go ahead.

365
00:26:30,391 --> 00:26:33,329
Agent Kerry Southwell, FBI.

366
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:35,441
Son of a bitch, they shot
a Federal agent.

367
00:26:35,587 --> 00:26:37,801
Good tourniquet on that leg.

368
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,463
And that trache...
that's battlefield style.

369
00:26:41,648 --> 00:26:42,874
What are you thinking?

370
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:45,991
I'm saying, I ain't seen
that since Afghanistan.

371
00:26:46,608 --> 00:26:48,920
You know, Wolf said things
to me on the phone.

372
00:26:49,064 --> 00:26:52,140
He used terms.
Stabilized, operations base.

373
00:26:52,324 --> 00:26:53,731
Military terms.

374
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:55,970
Military terms, military trache.

375
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:57,812
Said he and his men
have killed before.

376
00:26:57,989 --> 00:27:00,413
Think we got soldiers in there?

377
00:27:00,573 --> 00:27:03,820
If we got soldiers in there, this thing
could get very complicated.

378
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,900
Yo, brass ball.
Here we go.

379
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,106
Deputy Chief Abrami.
What brings you down here?

380
00:27:18,248 --> 00:27:21,861
I have to say, Cali, my new job title

381
00:27:21,981 --> 00:27:25,286
sounds even more satisfying
coming off your lips.

382
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:26,800
Well, I'm glad you like it.

383
00:27:26,927 --> 00:27:28,454
Though I think you got me confused.

384
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:30,964
You see, Tonray, he runs
the ass kissing department.

385
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:33,107
You got a good one here.

386
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:36,227
So what do you say
we get me caught up?

387
00:27:42,989 --> 00:27:45,173
Don't look at him, Ashley.

388
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:48,058
My old battered bladder
won't last here.

389
00:27:48,186 --> 00:27:50,443
You should say something.

390
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,562
W- what is she doing?

391
00:27:54,735 --> 00:27:57,522
I mean, that's making me
very nervous.

392
00:27:57,697 --> 00:28:01,198
She's smart.
She's angling that Pig.

393
00:28:01,356 --> 00:28:04,373
We should all be thinking
the same way.

394
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,129
Listen, I'm not suggesting
that we do something crazy here.

395
00:28:12,465 --> 00:28:15,591
But I planted my gun in that
flowerpot over there.

396
00:28:16,432 --> 00:28:18,474
What are you doing with a gun?

397
00:28:18,617 --> 00:28:20,801
I'm a criminal defense lawyer, Abe.

398
00:28:20,945 --> 00:28:22,842
Need I say more?

399
00:28:27,564 --> 00:28:29,259
Mr. Rabbit.

400
00:28:29,412 --> 00:28:32,509
Keep an eye on him.
He's having way too much fun.

401
00:28:33,184 --> 00:28:36,382
You know what, bring a TV over there.
Keep him distracted, all right?

402
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,939
Easy, easy, easy.

403
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:45,483
All I'm saying is, obey
the house rules.

404
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:47,076
Label your food.

405
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:49,065
Don't scratch your balls,
then use the remote.

406
00:28:49,223 --> 00:28:50,759
- Flush twice.
- Let me amend that.

407
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,322
Us two, you three.

408
00:28:52,496 --> 00:28:55,066
Sometimes you leave, like, this sand
at the bottom of the bowl.

409
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:56,544
It's disgusting.

410
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,257
Three, minimum.

411
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:05,800
Okay, this thing's ready.

412
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,100
Oh, smile at the birdie, ass lord.

413
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,814
Connie, we got eyes inside.

414
00:29:22,382 --> 00:29:23,839
Hallway's clean.

415
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:26,394
We can move in stealth through a vent
and then move for cover.

416
00:29:26,553 --> 00:29:29,630
- Stand by, Hawke.
- Too soon to make a move.

417
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:32,013
If we can make entry...

418
00:29:32,213 --> 00:29:34,225
we should move in right away.

419
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,436
I need to talk to her alone.

420
00:29:42,638 --> 00:29:45,195
- Take those two up front.
- Come on, let's go. Come on.

421
00:29:48,492 --> 00:29:51,121
You're gonna tell the families
of the deceased hostages

422
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:53,235
that we made a premature
move and we're sorry?

423
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,153
We're talking about
a tactical action.

424
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,803
Getting men inside the perimeter
to get us eyes and ears.

425
00:29:57,933 --> 00:30:00,203
Well, I don't think Wolf is gonna
interpret this move the same way.

426
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,863
In fact, I'm pretty sure
he'll be ready for it.

427
00:30:01,997 --> 00:30:04,795
'Cause you have some idea these
are combat-ready soldiers

428
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:07,428
who would not leave
a back hall open.

429
00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:08,354
That's right.

430
00:30:08,455 --> 00:30:10,614
Well, they have left it open, Captain.
And I'm not gonna wait

431
00:30:10,615 --> 00:30:11,850
for them to close it again.

432
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:14,439
People who wait often
miss golden opportunities.

433
00:30:14,596 --> 00:30:17,108
- You ever heard that?
- You're making a mistake.

434
00:30:17,236 --> 00:30:20,272
I've worked tactics before.
You see a hole, punch through it.

435
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:21,996
That's not what I meant.
When you said...

436
00:30:21,997 --> 00:30:24,058
people who wait
often miss golden opportunities,

437
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:26,040
you used a misplaced modifier.

438
00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:27,794
Confusing the message
recipient, me,

439
00:30:27,905 --> 00:30:30,376
about whether I'll miss a golden
opportunity if I wait frequently

440
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:33,464
or if I'll miss a golden opportunity
the very first time I wait.

441
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:36,129
I'll tell you what.
You give me a grammar lesson

442
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:38,214
after I teach you how
to save these hostages.

443
00:30:38,343 --> 00:30:40,421
It is too soon to make a move!

444
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,980
Let me put the screws
to these guys, for Christ sakes.

445
00:30:43,094 --> 00:30:45,621
I will get one hostage out
at a time. Save a life at a time.

446
00:30:45,747 --> 00:30:47,579
I will dwindle his currency
down to zero.

447
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,640
It is my negotiation. Let me talk.

448
00:30:49,644 --> 00:30:53,912
It's my department. My rank supercedes
your tactical site authority.

449
00:30:54,016 --> 00:30:56,558
Fine. I want it on record
that this is not my call.

450
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:59,071
Duly noted.
Was that the proper English, Professor,

451
00:30:59,185 --> 00:31:02,757
or should I have thrown in "ass"
in there somewhere?

452
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:05,175
Get your men in position.

453
00:31:05,304 --> 00:31:06,911
Let's end this.

454
00:31:10,543 --> 00:31:11,758
You...

455
00:31:12,178 --> 00:31:15,281
You like all this danger,
Ashley, don't you?

456
00:31:15,816 --> 00:31:16,644
No.

457
00:31:16,735 --> 00:31:19,779
I mean, you only
live once, right?

458
00:31:20,242 --> 00:31:24,523
- Can't get a second ticket.
- No. No, you're damn right you can't.

459
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:31,072
You looking at that?
You like my tattoo?

460
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:32,639
Yeah, it's cool.

461
00:31:32,781 --> 00:31:35,814
You got any more tattoos?

462
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:48,267
- I got that one.
- That's cool.

463
00:31:48,395 --> 00:31:50,426
Yeah, that's my favorite one.

464
00:31:50,593 --> 00:31:53,147
I bet you have a tattoo somewhere.

465
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,234
I got a couple little ones.

466
00:31:55,451 --> 00:31:58,336
Come on, I showed you mine.
Show me yours.

467
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,017
Sarge. Sarge.

468
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,519
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on, come on.

469
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:24,921
What's going on?

470
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,711
My friend Ashley was taken
by one of your guys.

471
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:40,302
I'm getting really embarrassed.

472
00:32:40,427 --> 00:32:41,800
No! Don't get embarrassed.

473
00:32:41,914 --> 00:32:45,168
My shy little self is gonna have to
ask you to turn around for a sec.

474
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:51,297
One more second, mister.

475
00:32:55,268 --> 00:32:57,219
- He didn't touch me, we were...
- I know, sweetie.

476
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:58,321
Don't worry about it. Just relax.

477
00:32:58,433 --> 00:32:59,873
Piggy, take her back. Take girly back.
Take girly back over there, man.

478
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:02,110
Take her to the other hostages.

479
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,743
Get back on patrol.
What is this bull?

480
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:09,700
- Look, it ain't what it looks like.
- Come on, man.

481
00:33:26,024 --> 00:33:30,992
Make contact. We'll distract them
while our boys make entry.

482
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:46,175
What can I do for you, Captain?

483
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:49,851
Just checking in.
It's been some time.

484
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:51,583
Yeah, well, I'm just sorting
through things.

485
00:33:51,584 --> 00:33:52,584
Trying to figure out
what I need next. That's all.

486
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:57,866
I hear a TV.
Watching the show?

487
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,610
Yep. Only show in town, right?

488
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:02,968
We got built-in drama.

489
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:04,545
Action.

490
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:07,690
Who knows, you and I, maybe
we could be stars after this.

491
00:34:07,865 --> 00:34:09,976
Yeah, well, too bad
I hate reality shows.

492
00:34:10,144 --> 00:34:15,254
You walk out the door of that bank
right now, we can cancel the show.

493
00:35:08,837 --> 00:35:10,491
Wolf?

494
00:35:10,994 --> 00:35:12,767
Breach comin'!
Breach!

495
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:14,749
Move it, move it!

496
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:18,999
Delta team, you lost surprise.
Retreat!

497
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,873
What the hell is going on?

498
00:35:31,044 --> 00:35:32,122
Come on!

499
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:38,418
I need backup!

500
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:40,223
Move in! Move!

501
00:35:44,786 --> 00:35:46,068
Move!

502
00:35:46,225 --> 00:35:47,395
Come on!

503
00:36:09,027 --> 00:36:11,381
Rabbit, Mr. Pig, push 'em back!

504
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,032
Move move move!
Move in.

505
00:36:21,036 --> 00:36:22,238
Get down, get down!

506
00:36:23,455 --> 00:36:25,330
Move move move!

507
00:36:27,346 --> 00:36:29,088
Grenade! Grenade!

508
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:30,250
Go, go!

509
00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:37,180
Come on.

510
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,054
Delta team,
talk to me!

511
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:47,167
Man down. Man down!
Zing has been hit.

512
00:36:49,056 --> 00:36:52,392
Come on, buddy.
Come on, stay with me, bro. Zing!

513
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:54,314
- Come on, Zing!
- Medic!

514
00:36:57,771 --> 00:37:00,001
God, damn it!

515
00:37:16,553 --> 00:37:17,633
Excuse me.

516
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:22,631
This operation is all mine now.

517
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:35,880
You let these pigs know they can't
screw with us like that, Sarge.

518
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:37,702
You know, I keep talking to you
about this, right?

519
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:39,182
You keep jerking around,
you know that?

520
00:37:39,311 --> 00:37:41,174
If you'd been patrolling the back hall
like you were supposed to,

521
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,065
they would have never made entry.
That's all I'm telling you.

522
00:37:49,182 --> 00:37:50,659
Talk to me, Wolf.

523
00:37:50,821 --> 00:37:52,642
Nice distraction, Cap.

524
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:56,434
All right, face to face
outside right now.

525
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:02,984
Gimme a vest.

526
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:06,352
It's time to prepare, Johnny Boy.

527
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:08,610
Focus and lock in.

528
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:10,896
Ready your mind.

529
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,050
Your eyes make a mark today...

530
00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:16,046
but to put it quite simply,

531
00:38:16,209 --> 00:38:18,248
will we be making a kill?

532
00:38:45,196 --> 00:38:48,942
Lower your weapons and step back,
all of you! Step back!

533
00:38:57,979 --> 00:38:59,827
What's up, Cap?

534
00:38:59,974 --> 00:39:02,982
- Mr. Wolf.
- That's right.

535
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:05,512
The breach wasn't my call.

536
00:39:05,641 --> 00:39:06,851
Yeah, sure.

537
00:39:07,032 --> 00:39:08,933
I was following orders.

538
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:12,048
Yeah, well, following orders
sometimes will cost lives.

539
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:14,411
In fact, it just did.

540
00:39:14,578 --> 00:39:17,281
Your men took out one of our SWAT
team members.

541
00:39:20,514 --> 00:39:23,939
T- that's why your army's
looking at me like that.

542
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:25,922
I'm a cop killer.

543
00:39:29,955 --> 00:39:32,581
I see you up there, snipes.

544
00:39:34,762 --> 00:39:37,163
I'm looking at you, SWAT.

545
00:39:42,305 --> 00:39:43,586
Uniforms.

546
00:39:43,768 --> 00:39:45,782
I know what you're thinking
about me, man.

547
00:39:45,907 --> 00:39:48,969
Já estive aqui. Já tive armas apontadas
para mim muitas vezes.

548
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,211
It's not new to me.
I know the fear.

549
00:39:51,411 --> 00:39:54,210
Go ahead. You wanna shoot me?
Go ahead, man, shoot me. Go ahead.

550
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:57,187
Look, I'll give you an easy
target, man. Come on.

551
00:39:58,937 --> 00:40:01,414
Go ahead, come on.
Go ahead, shoot me.

552
00:40:01,473 --> 00:40:03,019
Like they did in Fallujah, man

553
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:05,018
Or no, you know what?
How about here?

554
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:06,536
How about here, like...

555
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:09,328
Like that shrapnel blast
in Baghdad?

556
00:40:09,515 --> 00:40:11,783
Go ahead, shoot me.

557
00:40:12,058 --> 00:40:13,769
Come on, go ahead.

558
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,535
What are you waiting for?

559
00:40:18,087 --> 00:40:20,416
'Cause I love my country, man.

560
00:40:20,634 --> 00:40:23,481
I fought for my country and
I would die for my country.

561
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:25,415
You think I wanted to end up here?

562
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,099
You think I wanted
guns in my face again, man?

563
00:40:28,263 --> 00:40:29,995
No way!?

564
00:40:30,189 --> 00:40:31,819
No freakin' way.

565
00:40:35,283 --> 00:40:38,115
But I came home to sickness
and nightmares.

566
00:40:39,593 --> 00:40:41,920
Even when I close my eyes,
you know what I see?

567
00:40:43,328 --> 00:40:45,205
I see the faces
of the soldiers and civilians

568
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:46,748
that I killed, that's what I see.

569
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:48,904
I spoke to my captain.

570
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:52,937
And he makes me talk to a shrink
who doesn't know shit.

571
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:55,521
And then the goddamn government

572
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,563
smokes me out with their lies and away
goes my pension, away goes my medical.

573
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:02,324
And if my wife gets sick, who's gonna
pay for it, huh? Who's gonna pay?

574
00:41:02,483 --> 00:41:05,784
I pay!
We pay!

575
00:41:05,971 --> 00:41:10,457
I served my country, man.
I served... 15 years I gave.

576
00:41:10,627 --> 00:41:12,339
15 years.

577
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:15,112
Who's gonna protect me?

578
00:41:16,395 --> 00:41:19,122
Who's gonna protect me, huh? Who?

579
00:41:20,727 --> 00:41:23,256
So I started this and look
where I am, man.

580
00:41:23,257 --> 00:41:25,348
Look where I am.
Back in the firing line.

581
00:41:25,514 --> 00:41:28,237
So maybe you should shoot me. Go ahead.
Maybe you should shoot me.

582
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:31,372
I'd rather die than go to jail,
that's for damn sure.

583
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:34,534
I- I didn't spill my blood
for this country, for freedom,

584
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:37,003
to have it taken away when I came home.

585
00:41:37,148 --> 00:41:40,510
I got some demands 'cause they took
everything away from me, okay?

586
00:41:40,652 --> 00:41:44,355
I want antibiotics,
'cause I got injured in there.

587
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,554
And I want a flak jacket
for every soldier in Iraq!

588
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:52,401
'Cause our stupid-ass government
doesn't think that they're necessary.

589
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,281
And I want the son of every senator
who voted yes for this war

590
00:41:56,385 --> 00:41:58,596
to sign up for active duty!

591
00:41:58,737 --> 00:42:00,617
You get me those things,

592
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,480
and I'll leave here. I'll ask for a bus
and a chopper, and I'll disappear.

593
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:06,150
You got that?

594
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,393
Don't ever breach again, man.

595
00:42:13,521 --> 00:42:16,184
You know what's at stake,
and I know how to play.

596
00:43:05,036 --> 00:43:07,188
Tonray, looks like we're gonna be
here for a while,

597
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:08,556
so I need a few things from you

598
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:11,586
We got Wolf's face now, so get in touch
with the military. See if we can ID him.

599
00:43:11,658 --> 00:43:12,993
Connie!

600
00:43:14,473 --> 00:43:16,457
Connie, what are you doing
with the donuts?

601
00:43:17,087 --> 00:43:19,343
Connie, don't even think
about eating the donuts.

602
00:43:19,615 --> 00:43:21,728
Don't throw away
the goddamn donuts

603
00:43:21,943 --> 00:43:23,682
This is bull shit.

604
00:43:23,823 --> 00:43:27,743
I saw action, and I ain't robbing banks.

605
00:43:30,558 --> 00:43:34,667
Goddamn martyr's turning
this into a political cause.

606
00:43:35,388 --> 00:43:38,634
- It was a good play, Connie.
- Yeah.

607
00:43:38,778 --> 00:43:42,759
Stockholm Syndrome.
People can empathize with soldiers.

608
00:43:43,979 --> 00:43:47,497
Hey, he's just buying time
to plan his next move.

609
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:49,903
We have to come up with our own.

610
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:53,078
<i>It has been confirmed to News 14
that after much speculation,

611
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:55,376
<i>Alan Beck is indeed at the scene.

612
00:43:55,479 --> 00:43:57,949
<i>Now, we do have a crew
standing by with his location.

613
00:43:58,061 --> 00:44:01,381
<i>And we are expecting to go live
from there in the next few minutes.

614
00:44:11,831 --> 00:44:13,355
Excuse me, sir?

615
00:44:15,271 --> 00:44:17,166
<i>As we can see, Pittsburgh
real estate magnate

616
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:19,216
Alan Beck is indeed at the scene.

617
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:21,992
<i>And we're awaiting confirmation
that his daughter Ashley

618
00:44:22,101 --> 00:44:23,746
<i>is indeed one of the hostages.

619
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:26,449
<i>Now, born and raised right here
in Pittsburgh, Ashley's been the center

620
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,623
<i>of much media attention
throughout her childhood. But...

621
00:44:29,756 --> 00:44:31,177
<i>- ...especially this past year
- Here we go.

622
00:44:31,324 --> 00:44:33,632
<i>as her college life has become more
a point of interest.

623
00:44:33,762 --> 00:44:35,843
She just became our most
valuable commodity.

624
00:44:35,844 --> 00:44:36,462
<i>...attending Carnegie Mellon,
where she is...

625
00:44:36,463 --> 00:44:38,466
<i>- in her junior year.
- Hey, Mouse, turn the TV off.

626
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,582
<i>News 14 has heard
some speculation that Ashley...

627
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:42,744
Cat, Piggy, you're gonna
be on foot patrol.

628
00:44:42,745 --> 00:44:44,142
You're gonna check out schematics.

629
00:44:44,623 --> 00:44:46,753
All right, get to it, fellas, come on.

630
00:44:46,894 --> 00:44:48,290
Thanks, boss.

631
00:45:04,142 --> 00:45:07,839
What's going on?
I haven't seen you talk to anybody.

632
00:45:08,561 --> 00:45:11,551
Let's get that blood off
of you for starters, huh?

633
00:45:15,971 --> 00:45:17,856
Just a little wet, okay? That's all.

634
00:45:18,017 --> 00:45:19,606
There we go. That's it.

635
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:22,927
You clean up well. Look at that.

636
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:26,610
You know, it looks like I'm
in control here, but...

637
00:45:26,753 --> 00:45:29,068
actually I'm just...

638
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,811
I don't know.

639
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:35,111
I'm just trying
not to let bad things...

640
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:40,973
I'm just sorry you saw what you saw.

641
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:56,523
Thank you.

642
00:46:14,207 --> 00:46:16,913
There's no way. We stay in here.

643
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:21,862
Here it is, Captain.

644
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,907
All right, what do we got?

645
00:46:26,627 --> 00:46:29,947
Name, Jake Mendez. Three tours in Iraq

646
00:46:30,106 --> 00:46:32,129
Ran his own platoon, the 1013.

647
00:46:32,315 --> 00:46:35,995
Spent a lot of time in Fallujah.
Patrolled Baghdad and Babylon.

648
00:46:36,142 --> 00:46:37,965
Couple of killer "B"s, Captain.

649
00:46:38,091 --> 00:46:42,053
Wife died last year.
16-year-old son.

650
00:46:42,218 --> 00:46:43,676
Wait.

651
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:45,674
Look at this.

652
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:47,642
Christ.

653
00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:49,451
This needs to be read
as soon as possible.

654
00:46:49,578 --> 00:46:51,973
Tonray, print out multiple copies.
Get it to our friends in the press

655
00:46:52,116 --> 00:46:55,109
Connie, track down his platoon-mates.
Some of them may be inside with him.

656
00:46:55,223 --> 00:46:58,586
- Who is this guy, really?
- That's what I hope to find out.

657
00:46:58,752 --> 00:47:02,104
Tonray, find out if the owner, Marco,
has a partner named Marco.

658
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:05,573
Okay, um, but...
how do you want me to prioritize that?

659
00:47:05,678 --> 00:47:08,518
- Is that important or not?
- Is that important or not?

660
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:11,332
Tonray, there are so many things wrong
with the construction of that sentence,

661
00:47:11,451 --> 00:47:13,174
I can't even stand
to look at you right now.

662
00:47:13,175 --> 00:47:15,638
Okay, please, just go
get it done, now? Thank you.

663
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:23,085
Update on special agent Southwell.

664
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:26,299
She's out of surgery,
in critical condition.

665
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:29,298
The FBI is sending a team down
to assist us.

666
00:47:29,403 --> 00:47:34,418
-And someone is on their way to see you.
- That'll have to wait.

667
00:47:34,562 --> 00:47:36,498
It's not a request, it's an order.

668
00:47:37,017 --> 00:47:39,142
By one of the man's closest friends.

669
00:47:39,176 --> 00:47:40,800
The mayor.

670
00:47:41,098 --> 00:47:43,928
Alan Beck is coming.

671
00:47:44,467 --> 00:47:50,241
<i>My daughter is inside the bank.
So the speculation can now stop.

672
00:47:51,445 --> 00:47:54,376
<i>I know this from a message
she left for me

673
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:57,136
<i>shortly after the siege began.

674
00:47:57,303 --> 00:48:01,826
<i>With that said, we're all aware
that there are other hostages inside.

675
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:05,393
<i>I would hope that the media
would respect that fact

676
00:48:05,506 --> 00:48:09,097
<i>and not make this
situation all about Ashley.

677
00:48:09,227 --> 00:48:10,790
Talk to the man.

678
00:48:10,905 --> 00:48:12,694
Buy us time.

679
00:48:13,415 --> 00:48:17,204
<i>Words cannot express what
my daughter means to me.

680
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:19,764
<i>Thank you very much.

681
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:23,158
That's how he used to say
good night to me when I was little.

682
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:26,460
Grabbed my nose,
saying that he stole it.

683
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:30,410
I wonder if they let the rest
of our families know yet.

684
00:48:30,569 --> 00:48:33,312
My goddamn girlfriend probably thinks
I'm out bangin' around on her again.

685
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:34,983
Crazy broad.

686
00:48:35,101 --> 00:48:37,363
My husband probably
figured it out by now.

687
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:39,327
Your families too.

688
00:48:39,437 --> 00:48:41,794
- You have a husband?
- Robby.

689
00:48:43,903 --> 00:48:46,230
Rabbit, come here.

690
00:48:47,275 --> 00:48:49,626
We gotta find an alternate
exit, all right?

691
00:48:49,756 --> 00:48:52,513
It's gonna take some time, so we're
gonna roll into combat schedule.

692
00:48:52,645 --> 00:48:55,007
Strict patrols, rest on rotation.

693
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:57,506
Just, we gotta manage
the fatigue, all right?

694
00:48:58,134 --> 00:49:02,036
All right, whose laptop is this? huh?
Huh? Come on, people.

695
00:49:02,124 --> 00:49:03,963
Whose laptop is this?
Come on, people.

696
00:49:04,093 --> 00:49:05,740
Talk to me.
Whose laptop is this?

697
00:49:05,858 --> 00:49:08,502
- It's mine. Mine.
- What's your name,Junior?

698
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,510
It's Robby.

699
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:11,440
I'm his father.

700
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:14,320
I think it best if you just spoke to me.

701
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,890
All right,you know how to work these?

702
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:20,670
All right,you know what we're gonna do?

703
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:21,640
We're gonna separate you guys

704
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:23,160
<i>into two groups,okay?

705
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:24,310
Robby Rob and his dad,

706
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,290
Ashley Beck and her little friends

707
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,170
into one group.

708
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,160
And everybody else
is in the other group.

709
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:28,720
Just push 'em to the other
side of the bank.

710
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,400
Okay,come on,everybody up!

711
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,400
<i>Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

712
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,860
You and you. You two.

713
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,980
<i>You,you,you.
The skinnies and the fatties.

714
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:37,940
Get close to me.

715
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,430
The rest of you follow me.

716
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:41,380
Why are you separating us like this?

717
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:45,070
You ask another question,

718
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,730
and I will shatter every
bone in your face.

719
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:49,920
That goes for everybody.

720
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,490
<i>Come on, let's go.

721
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:04,020
Hey,Cap,what can I do for you?

722
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,240
I just wanted to let you know

723
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,260
that the military released
your dossier,Sergeant.

724
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,970
Oh,yeah? I hope you like fiction.

725
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,720
<i>Actually,I do not.

726
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:13,770
So why don't you tell
me what really happened?

727
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,680
You got my antibiotics?

728
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:17,860
Do you have my hostage?

729
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:19,530
Yep.
Okay.

730
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,680
Then the medicine's on the way.

731
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,470
<i>What about
my other demands,huh?

732
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,130
I'm not getting out of here
until they're met.

733
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,410
Now,Mr. Wolf,you and I both know

734
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:29,010
those are gonna take some time.

735
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:36,400
<i>Q, radio in sight.

736
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,360
<i>HT coming to the door.

737
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:43,270
All right,come on.

738
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:44,500
Say your good-byes.

739
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,840
Get up,get up. Come on,come on.

740
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,090
You're going home.

741
00:50:57,610 --> 00:50:58,880
Come on.

742
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:46,010
<i>If you are
just joining us,

743
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,620
<i>we are here in market square.

744
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:48,390
<i>There has been
a bank robbery

745
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,810
<i>at Three Rivers Trust.

746
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,620
<i>The details are sketchy,
but we do know

747
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,790
<i>there is an unknown
number of hostages inside.

748
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,110
<i>Those details
will become available to us

749
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:00,850
<i>and of course
we'll bring them to you.

750
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:03,030
<i>Keep it here to News 14
for more details.

751
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:07,440
Bernard Kuzmicki,an older gay man.

752
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,040
He's been a customer
of mine for 15 years.

753
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,160
Addie's been giving us
hostage and HT positions.

754
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:15,280
Firepower.

755
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:17,530
And that the HTs know
Ashley Beck is inside.

756
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,870
Anything about Wolf?

757
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:21,400
That he's clearly in charge.
Calm.

758
00:52:21,435 --> 00:52:23,970
She says they're a tight unit.
A well-oiled machine.

759
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,450
Continue with the hostages,Addie.

760
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,700
Okay,Theodore Sabian.

761
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,770
Kind of a happy fat man.

762
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,420
<i>Longtime customer.

763
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,850
And his son Robby.

764
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,350
How old would you say the boy is,Addie?

765
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,010
15,16.

766
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,030
So he's the youngest hostage?

767
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:42,370
<i>Oh,definitely.

768
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:44,830
Yes,I could say that for sure.

769
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,030
Excuse us,Ms. Berman.

770
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,980
Excuse me one second.

771
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,310
Get the boy out of harm's way.

772
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,820
Absolutely.

773
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,910
Why'd they break us up like this,huh?

774
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:11,540
They cut off all our communications.

775
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:13,450
No emails,no calls out,no nothing.

776
00:53:13,684 --> 00:53:16,174
But there's a bunch of other
frequencies out there.

777
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:18,189
If we can get this kid
to get us onto an open,

778
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,388
unblocked one...

779
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:21,229
money.

780
00:53:21,255 --> 00:53:23,145
- Okay, that's it.
- What?

781
00:53:23,256 --> 00:53:24,839
You'll have to get word to this person.

782
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:26,692
See, that's the new frequency
that I just tapped into.

783
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:28,625
And then you can communicate with them.

784
00:53:29,576 --> 00:53:31,875
How the hell do you know
all this stuff, man?

785
00:53:31,999 --> 00:53:34,072
I actually kind of taught myself,

786
00:53:34,184 --> 00:53:36,313
so that I could listen
to people's cell phone conversations

787
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:38,674
and then get them in trouble
if they pissed me off.

788
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,173
You're a crazy kid, man.

789
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:41,975
Don't tell them...
only speak when spoken to...

790
00:53:42,082 --> 00:53:45,155
I can handle myself... You know what,
Dad, I am sick and tired of...

791
00:53:45,257 --> 00:53:46,650
Hey, guys! Guys, guys.

792
00:53:46,761 --> 00:53:49,791
Save the dysfunctional bullshit
for the dinner table, all right?

793
00:53:49,952 --> 00:53:53,110
It's not appropriate
for a hostage siege, please.

794
00:53:53,255 --> 00:53:55,024
Sarge, a minute?

795
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:02,361
What's going on?

796
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:06,152
All respect due, but why haven't you
asked them for a chopper or a bus?

797
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,730
Come on, man. Come on, bro.
That never works, man.

798
00:54:08,872 --> 00:54:12,224
People don't just drive off to their
freedom. Doesn't work like that.

799
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:14,520
We're gonna be so easily tracked. Come
on, man, if we wanna get out of here,

800
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:17,762
we have to come up with something
that they won't see coming.

801
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:20,205
- You got that?
- Yeah.

802
00:54:20,317 --> 00:54:21,465
You're on TV, Mr. Wolf.

803
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,790
<i>It has been confirmed
that Jake Mendez

804
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:24,590
<i>is a military criminal.

805
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,950
<i>Court martialed for the deaths

806
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:28,430
<i>of 16 fellow soldiers.

807
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:29,890
<i>The details
are still sketchy

808
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:31,540
<i>at this time,
but what we can tell you

809
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,990
is that he was sentenced
to one year in Leavenworth

810
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,800
<i>following a plea bargain.

811
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,930
<i>He was stripped
of his pension

812
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:38,580
<i>and his military benefits.

813
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:39,600
<i>Attempts are being made

814
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,550
to contact other members
of Mendez's platoon.

815
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:44,920
<i>In hopes that they too
can add to the details

816
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:46,890
<i>of what actually
occurred over there.

817
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:49,500
<i>How did 16 men
lose their lives

818
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,720
<i>during this time
of service?

819
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,090
You did it,Cap.

820
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,090
You made sure I didn't
become a martyr.

821
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,540
Let's forget about that
for a moment,shall we?

822
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,880
I wanna ask you for a favor,Mr. Wolf.

823
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,150
We debriefed the hostage,

824
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:31,060
<i>she told us
there's a boy inside.

825
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,600
What do you say you send him out?

826
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,380
I'd love to,Cap,but I can't.

827
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,390
Why is that?

828
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:37,820
Because I really like
the kid,that's why.

829
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,040
You have a son,Mr. Wolf.

830
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,750
I think you can appreciate my request.

831
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,730
Let's get the boy out of harm's way.

832
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:44,390
It's not gonna happen,Cap.

833
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,600
<i>I'll tell you what,

834
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,900
you do me a favor,I'll do you a favor.

835
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,760
You want steak and lobster for dinner?

836
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,260
You want Direct TV?

837
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,165
I'm not interested,Cap.
Forget it.

838
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:55,100
I want you to release the boy.

839
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,070
Wanting's a lot better
than having sometimes.

840
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,030
Conversation over.

841
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,630
<i>Mr...

842
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,610
Kill the electric,now!

843
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:19,190
Nobody move!

844
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:20,410
Hey,Robby,did you link the Blackberry?

845
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,450
Couldn't finish linking it.

846
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:22,870
- Why not?
- Listen,if we lose the power,

847
00:56:22,905 --> 00:56:24,250
<i>we're gonna
lose the clear frequency.

848
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,480
<i>And if we lose
the clear frequency,

849
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,750
then you will not be able
to contact anyone.

850
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:27,860
Come on,man. Are you trying hard enough?

851
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,950
I am trying the best that I can.

852
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,540
Come on,don't slack on me,buddy-boy.

853
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,870
Come on.

854
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,380
If I get the electricity back,

855
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,830
you can tap into that frequency?

856
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:39,110
Man,did you see how complicated
that was,Sarge?

857
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:41,540
No. No,we need the kid.

858
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:49,020
I need the electricity back.

859
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:49,830
You know the price.

860
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,560
Look,I'll give you anybody
else except the boy.

861
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,345
Anybody.

862
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,280
You get power back,
when you release Robby Sabian.

863
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,340
<i>Look,just take somebody else
for the electricity, all right?

864
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:58,160
I want the boy out of danger.

865
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,050
Come on,save a life
and take somebody else.

866
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,770
Give me the child,Mr. Wolf.

867
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,630
<i>I'll give youexactly one hour

868
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,650
to give me electricity back

869
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:07,160
or I kill a hostage,you got that?

870
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,210
what happened to the lights?

871
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:22,730
<i>Shh,I don't know.
Just go.

872
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:23,880
I'm not like a boy.

873
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,430
I can't just aim my stream,you know?

874
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,190
I can't even see the vent.

875
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:30,690
I need a sliver of light.
This is insane.

876
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,310
There's no sliver. It's gone.

877
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:33,830
Just go or I'm gonna pee in my pants.

878
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,300
I haven't pinched the head of my prick

879
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,350
to stop the flow
of piss since I'm seven.

880
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:38,790
We have to do this,Renee.

881
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,060
Stay put,stay quiet.

882
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:41,730
We go out there,they might kill us.

883
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,970
I don't know you and
I'm gonna pee in front of you?

884
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,710
Just do it and get it in the vent.

885
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:47,040
Don't get it on my shoes or my socks.

886
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:48,580
I hate wet socks. Okay,fine,fine.

887
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,740
I gotta focus,all right?

888
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,790
All right,all right,all right.

889
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,290
Oh,my God! Are you hard?

890
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,220
Sorry,it's a reflex.

891
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,620
You're down there and
you're bumped against me.

892
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,353
- Are you going?
- Shut up!

893
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:07,020
Addie just ID'd the HTs
from their military file.

894
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,290
All from Wolf's platoon.

895
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,050
Wolf,we know him.

896
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,710
Brothers Albert and Henry Roman.

897
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,190
<i>Both had records from before
they went into the military.

898
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,620
Assault,burglary,drunk and disorderly.

899
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:22,120
<i>And yet Henry
is a decorated soldier.

900
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:23,890
Did three tours. Didn't have to.

901
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,550
Another war hero. Great.

902
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:29,890
You really think they're gonna
execute a hostage?

903
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,920
Just to get their lights back?

904
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:31,990
I don't know.

905
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,230
I don't know what he's capable of.

906
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,110
That's what I have to figure out.

907
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,380
Cali,don't tell me you're thinking

908
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,780
of giving in to Wolf.

909
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,740
I'm thinking about what
I always think about,sir.

910
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:41,820
Saving lives.

911
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,250
You know the policy.

912
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:45,340
We do not give in to death threats.

913
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,620
<i>You said it yourself,

914
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:48,670
I know the policy.

915
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:51,480
Good,don't make a move
without consulting me.

916
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,900
Yes,sir.

917
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,790
Cap.

918
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:58,770
If Wolf is really gonna kill a hostage,

919
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,650
don't you think we should just give
him the electricity back?

920
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,280
Get another one out?

921
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:05,930
Tonray, if I give in,
then I give him the power.

922
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,550
I cannot afford to give him the power

923
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,860
if it's only a bluff.

924
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:10,330
Otherwise,we'll be here for days.

925
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,190
Now,let me ask you a question.

926
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,580
Have you spoken to Marco yet?

927
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:15,065
- No.
- Would you go take care of that,please?

928
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,440
Thank you, good-bye.

929
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:22,510
Why,Connie?

930
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:24,707
Why would Wolf go balls
to the wall for the kid?

931
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,420
My guess is he thinks
we won't breach

932
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:27,660
if he has a child inside.

933
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,960
That'soo easy.

934
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:30,730
Well,I have no idea.

935
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,088
I understand.
Look...

936
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:33,990
let's get some intel
on Robby Sabian.

937
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,500
Just in case it's something else.

938
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,250
Yeah.

939
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,730
Deputy Chief.

940
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,200
Beck's arrived.

941
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:50,260
Christ,Sarge,did you really say that?

942
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,390
I got no choice,man.

943
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,240
You said we weren't gonna kill anyone.

944
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,980
Right,but we need electricity.

945
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:56,510
Sarge,do u think you really

946
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,060
<i>put one of these people down?

947
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,870
I'm not going back to jail,man.

948
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:01,520
Neither are you guys,okay?
It'd be our end.

949
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:02,460
This is a numbers game.

950
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:04,814
It's just our five lives
or one of theirs. That's all.

951
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,240
Do you think they'd
really call your bluff

952
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,920
and not turn the electricity on?

953
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,450
Yeah,if it feels like it's
an empty threat,yeah.

954
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:13,240
But I'll do my damnedest
to make sure he feels it's full.

955
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,000
All right,any more questions?

956
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:19,730
It's like Survivor.

957
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,630
Someone's getting run off today.

958
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:23,880
Do you think they'd
really kill one of us?

959
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:24,620
I don't think so.

960
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:26,730
It's probably just a bluff.

961
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:29,020
Don't pretend you know them,all right?

962
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:29,920
I'm not.

963
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,250
They've been pretty cool to me,Dad.

964
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:32,190
Yeah,they've been pretty cool to you

965
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,880
because they need you,okay?

966
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,380
These are not cool guys,Robby.

967
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,450
These are bank robbers.

968
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:37,520
Real observant of you,Dad.

969
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,570
Thanks for pointing that out.

970
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,550
Cut the tone. I will not stand for...

971
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:41,790
Hey. I won't!

972
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:44,140
Hey,listen.

973
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,870
We have to get word
to the other group, okay?

974
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,320
They couldn't hear Wolf.

975
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:49,380
And it's less than an hour

976
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:50,570
till time's up.

977
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,330
They should know.

978
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,350
What are you doing?

979
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:10,790
Excuse me?

980
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,650
How about a bathroom break?

981
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,390
What is it?

982
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,910
Leroy,what does it say?

983
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:01,260
Captain Cali,thank you for seeing me.

984
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,030
I'll get right to the point.

985
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,480
My daughter's a little bit like me.

986
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,770
She's not gonna wait to be rescued.

987
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:08,860
My fear is that she may try something

988
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:10,560
that will get her or someone else

989
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,010
inside there injured.

990
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:13,180
Mm-hmm.

991
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,950
I would appreciate it
if you would get her out

992
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,910
before she does something stupid.

993
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:21,300
Removing Ashley from that bank

994
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,290
will benefit everyone inside.

995
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:24,780
I understand.

996
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:28,840
I'll do my best to get
everyone out safely.

997
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:37,120
Thank you.

998
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,410
Appreciation is an interesting
thing, Captain.

999
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,050
Many people would
say it's a very good thing

1000
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,390
to be on the receiving end
of my appreciation.

1001
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:53,620
Now,can we talk or not?

1002
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,490
I thought we were.

1003
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:58,200
Talk like gentlemen.

1004
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,380
Why don't we cut the cipher-like jargon?

1005
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:05,270
Everybody in that bank
is of equal value.

1006
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,010
Not every life
is of equal value,Captain.

1007
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:11,710
It's naive of you to think so.

1008
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,671
I went through the rest
of his military file.

1009
01:03:21,836 --> 01:03:23,822
The incident that caused
his court martial,

1010
01:03:23,949 --> 01:03:25,517
Wolf disobeyed a direct order.

1011
01:03:25,644 --> 01:03:27,647
Refusing to send his platoon
into a hot zone.

1012
01:03:27,787 --> 01:03:29,971
Another platoon was sent
in which resulted in casualties.

1013
01:03:30,101 --> 01:03:32,759
That's not the crime I was expecting.

1014
01:03:32,859 --> 01:03:36,347
Nope. He's got several instances
of alcohol abuse.

1015
01:03:37,524 --> 01:03:39,676
And a long paper trail
about his mental state.

1016
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,878
You speak to the men
in his platoon?

1017
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,716
Can't find half of them. The ones I did
speak to wouldn't say much.

1018
01:03:44,868 --> 01:03:47,499
- Blue code of silence.
- Camouflage code of silence.

1019
01:03:47,627 --> 01:03:49,356
Let's try and talk the war hero down.

1020
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:03,165
All right, Cap. Ready to turn my lights
on and give me the power back?

1021
01:04:03,277 --> 01:04:04,427
Not yet.

1022
01:04:04,611 --> 01:04:07,771
I want to talk to you about
reconsidering your demands.

1023
01:04:07,964 --> 01:04:09,482
What do you wanna talk about?

1024
01:04:09,661 --> 01:04:11,626
You wanna talk about killing?
Is that what you wanna talk about, huh?

1025
01:04:11,768 --> 01:04:14,393
'Cause, you know, I'm guessing you
probably know diddly-squat about that.

1026
01:04:14,536 --> 01:04:16,970
You'd be guessing wrong, Mr. Wolf.

1027
01:04:17,097 --> 01:04:19,569
Oh, yeah. Oh, right, 'cause you've
taken somebody's life, right?

1028
01:04:19,697 --> 01:04:22,441
I didn't take someone's life.
I defended my own.

1029
01:04:22,565 --> 01:04:24,531
Yeah, well, killing's killing, Cap.

1030
01:04:24,678 --> 01:04:26,917
Especially from the corpse's
point of view.

1031
01:04:27,074 --> 01:04:29,563
What you're talking about doing
is not defense.

1032
01:04:29,564 --> 01:04:31,744
You'd be killing without
provocation, Mr. Wolf.

1033
01:04:31,745 --> 01:04:33,225
You're the one who's provoking me.

1034
01:04:33,226 --> 01:04:36,052
Because you took something I need for
survival, and I'm just defending that.

1035
01:04:36,125 --> 01:04:38,223
You have no idea what my men and I
have been through over there

1036
01:04:38,224 --> 01:04:39,896
and you have no idea
what we're capable of either.

1037
01:04:39,897 --> 01:04:40,887
You're a soldier, Sergeant.

1038
01:04:40,888 --> 01:04:43,201
You're trained to protect American
citizens, not kill them.

1039
01:04:43,202 --> 01:04:46,660
Don't play that with me, okay?
I'm beyond that.

1040
01:04:46,695 --> 01:04:48,849
You know what I learned
when I came home?

1041
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:52,388
I learned that life's one big,
shit-eating war. That's what I learned.

1042
01:04:52,423 --> 01:04:54,078
And in this war of attrition,

1043
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:56,500
I'm a soldier of misfortune
till the very end.

1044
01:04:56,535 --> 01:04:59,923
You kill a hostage,
negotiations are over.

1045
01:04:59,924 --> 01:05:03,876
No, that's when negotiations
begin, Cap. Ciao.

1046
01:05:21,394 --> 01:05:23,154
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sarge.

1047
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,170
Sarge, it's me.

1048
01:05:25,952 --> 01:05:28,762
Shit, I gotta deal with friendly
fire here too?

1049
01:05:29,808 --> 01:05:32,431
All right, look, we only
have 22 minutes left.

1050
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:33,432
Which one, Mikey?

1051
01:05:34,324 --> 01:05:36,340
Which one?

1052
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:39,151
- What?
- Help me. How do I choose, man?

1053
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:41,893
Do I take the one with the life
that's worth the least?

1054
01:05:41,928 --> 01:05:44,034
The one with no potential?
The one with no family?

1055
01:05:44,401 --> 01:05:46,448
The oldest one?
How do I choose, man?

1056
01:05:48,349 --> 01:05:49,898
Help me.

1057
01:06:05,287 --> 01:06:07,410
What do you make of that?

1058
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:10,440
Let's go visit Connie.

1059
01:06:15,258 --> 01:06:17,197
Look at Wolf. Did you see him?

1060
01:06:17,232 --> 01:06:19,157
Deciding which one of us it's gonna be.

1061
01:06:19,158 --> 01:06:20,876
Maybe we should make a run for it.

1062
01:06:20,877 --> 01:06:24,178
- I'd rather go down making a break.
- No, we should stay put.

1063
01:06:24,938 --> 01:06:28,235
- I think we're gonna be okay.
- Oh, you do?

1064
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:31,623
Oh, well, that's fantastic.
And it's really reassuring.

1065
01:06:31,658 --> 01:06:35,031
My heart just stopped racing
and suddenly my stomach feels great.

1066
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:36,089
Just great.

1067
01:06:36,199 --> 01:06:38,896
- Hey, what about my gun?
- No.

1068
01:06:38,931 --> 01:06:41,740
We make that move now, we're done.

1069
01:06:44,783 --> 01:06:49,467
He's killed 16 people.
You heard the television, right?

1070
01:06:49,468 --> 01:06:51,204
The guy's a killer.
He's a murderer.

1071
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:54,356
You keep talking this doom,
I'm gonna knock you out cold.

1072
01:06:54,391 --> 01:06:56,218
I gotta make it through this.

1073
01:06:56,538 --> 01:06:58,932
I got little boys at home.

1074
01:06:58,933 --> 01:07:02,877
But me, I don't have a family, do I?

1075
01:07:02,912 --> 01:07:06,580
I'm just a sad, lonely 45-year-old

1076
01:07:06,581 --> 01:07:08,592
with no ties to anyone.

1077
01:07:08,627 --> 01:07:11,711
My death will have repercussions
for no one. Right?

1078
01:07:11,712 --> 01:07:14,760
I mean, no one, of course, but me.

1079
01:07:14,761 --> 01:07:16,421
God, I feel nauseous.

1080
01:07:16,456 --> 01:07:18,793
It's the candle that's making you sick.

1081
01:07:18,794 --> 01:07:22,207
I believe their candle's a soothing
coconut ginger honey.

1082
01:07:22,242 --> 01:07:24,294
I would have preferred that
as my death scent.

1083
01:07:24,295 --> 01:07:29,279
It's not the candle. Christ, Bernard,
death is staring us in the face.

1084
01:07:29,314 --> 01:07:30,709
I'm trying to get
my mind off of something

1085
01:07:30,744 --> 01:07:34,088
that I have no control
over, Mr. Shelton

1086
01:07:34,123 --> 01:07:37,433
Don't let your fear own you.
Que sera sera.

1087
01:07:39,487 --> 01:07:41,402
We should breach, Connie.

1088
01:07:41,437 --> 01:07:44,180
They are clearly
about to execute somebody.

1089
01:07:44,215 --> 01:07:45,306
This proves it.

1090
01:07:45,341 --> 01:07:48,684
Hawke, you better calm down.

1091
01:07:55,434 --> 01:07:57,371
Cap, you need to see this.

1092
01:07:57,372 --> 01:08:00,072
Hawke found this by the hatch
in the basement.

1093
01:08:00,073 --> 01:08:02,484
The bathroom's right
by that door.

1094
01:08:03,211 --> 01:08:05,856
Have them dust it for fingerprints.

1095
01:08:06,889 --> 01:08:09,407
You find out if Tonray's
spoken to Marco?

1096
01:08:14,412 --> 01:08:17,408
I vaguely remember
when taking a long-held piss

1097
01:08:17,443 --> 01:08:20,329
was tantamount to a goddamn orgasm.

1098
01:08:20,593 --> 01:08:23,506
These stones are making a mess
of my urethra.

1099
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:26,420
Captain Horst Cali. Fired his weapon
seven times in three years

1100
01:08:26,421 --> 01:08:27,664
before he went to New York.

1101
01:08:27,665 --> 01:08:29,623
Did his negotiator traing there.

1102
01:08:29,658 --> 01:08:31,916
It's the best program in the country.

1103
01:08:31,951 --> 01:08:35,907
There is one option here. We can see
if the man just does the right thing.

1104
01:08:35,908 --> 01:08:39,513
He has a no-casualty rate
for 13 straight negotiations.

1105
01:08:39,514 --> 01:08:43,000
We just find somebody
comparable, that's all.

1106
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:45,283
I'm just not confortable
dealing with

1107
01:08:45,318 --> 01:08:47,213
somebody who's not interested
in listening to me.

1108
01:08:47,214 --> 01:08:50,510
Especially when my daughter's
life is in the balance.

1109
01:08:50,545 --> 01:08:51,726
I made the phone calls, Alan.

1110
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:55,041
The FBI's putting through a unit
for secondary position.

1111
01:08:55,042 --> 01:08:58,692
They have something at stake here,
because their agent was shot.

1112
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:02,348
I'd be a lot more comfortable
if they were involved.

1113
01:09:24,432 --> 01:09:26,165
We were on the mend, Jim,

1114
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,995
She was giving me a second chance.

1115
01:09:28,419 --> 01:09:30,614
If somebody takes that
chance away from me...

1116
01:09:32,195 --> 01:09:34,675
Get on the phone.

1117
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:36,423
Sarge.

1118
01:09:37,445 --> 01:09:38,990
Sarge.

1119
01:09:39,229 --> 01:09:40,950
I want you to know that

1120
01:09:40,985 --> 01:09:42,829
what needs to get done shortly,

1121
01:09:42,864 --> 01:09:44,657
we don't have a problem doing it.

1122
01:09:44,658 --> 01:09:46,915
We're not saying that you do, but

1123
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:49,653
me and Henry know
our roles in this thing.

1124
01:09:49,654 --> 01:09:52,335
We're the assassins.

1125
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:54,240
We do what it takes
to get us out of here.

1126
01:09:54,241 --> 01:09:56,013
If it comes down to zero hour,

1127
01:09:56,048 --> 01:09:59,780
and he still hasn't given
us electricity, we'll do the deed.

1128
01:09:59,815 --> 01:10:01,639
You sure you're up to it?

1129
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,630
We're up to it.

1130
01:10:09,602 --> 01:10:11,240
Yeah, what's up, Cap?

1131
01:10:12,094 --> 01:10:13,803
I'll be right there.

1132
01:10:14,872 --> 01:10:17,574
Sounds like he's ready to compromise.

1133
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:35,366
Hope you're not wasting my time, Cap

1134
01:10:35,508 --> 01:10:39,079
Came to give you some information
about some of the hostages.

1135
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,059
Perhaps you'll find it useful.

1136
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:43,961
Bernard Kuzmicki,
he has a heart condition.

1137
01:10:43,962 --> 01:10:46,334
Found that out from his sister Carol.

1138
01:10:46,369 --> 01:10:49,658
Henry Clement's father,
he's out of surgery, recovering nicely.

1139
01:10:49,659 --> 01:10:51,635
Leroy Barnes,

1140
01:10:51,636 --> 01:10:54,259
his wife called,
told us he has an ulcer.

1141
01:10:54,294 --> 01:10:56,740
She also said his two little boys
are very worried about him.

1142
01:10:56,741 --> 01:10:58,557
She said not to worry.

1143
01:10:58,592 --> 01:11:01,399
She told the boys Leroy's working late.

1144
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,265
All right, don't contact me again

1145
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,227
unless you're ready to give
me back my power. You got that?

1146
01:11:08,228 --> 01:11:11,963
And you got 12 minutes or bad
and bloody things are gonna happen.

1147
01:11:19,823 --> 01:11:21,616
What'd he say?

1148
01:11:21,651 --> 01:11:23,044
Did he blink?

1149
01:11:23,792 --> 01:11:27,663
Captain! Captain, I finally got in touch
with the warden at Leavenworth.

1150
01:11:27,664 --> 01:11:29,462
Turns out Wolf had
a breakdown in prison.

1151
01:11:29,463 --> 01:11:30,463
He suffered from post traumatic
stress syndrome.

1152
01:11:31,676 --> 01:11:33,661
Other than that, his prison
file is pretty clean.

1153
01:11:33,662 --> 01:11:34,662
What about Marco?

1154
01:11:35,317 --> 01:11:37,859
Oh, yeah, Marco.

1155
01:11:38,344 --> 01:11:41,262
He doesn't have a cousin
Marco. Or a friend.

1156
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:42,489
He wants to know why you're asking.

1157
01:11:42,524 --> 01:11:44,919
No, you wanna know why I'm asking.

1158
01:11:44,954 --> 01:11:47,315
Get me a can of spray paint.
No questions asked!

1159
01:11:47,316 --> 01:11:49,977
- Spray paint?
- Go!

1160
01:11:59,642 --> 01:12:02,236
What the hell are you doing?

1161
01:12:03,093 --> 01:12:06,048
We got eight minutes, Cap.
The clock is ticking.

1162
01:12:06,049 --> 01:12:09,013
And he ain't showing
no signs of breaking.

1163
01:12:26,473 --> 01:12:30,110
Six minutes left.
And Wolf is eyeing me.

1164
01:12:30,145 --> 01:12:33,670
Just my luck. Great, this'll be
the first lottery I ever win.

1165
01:12:33,671 --> 01:12:37,058
- Please be quiet over there.
- Calm down, Mr. Shelton.

1166
01:12:37,982 --> 01:12:41,222
We're the bad group. They're pulling
the people they're going to kill

1167
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:42,223
from this group.

1168
01:12:43,581 --> 01:12:46,292
Forgive me, I've got to do this.

1169
01:12:46,327 --> 01:12:49,707
Mr. Rabbit, I need to speak
to Mr. Wolf now.

1170
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:50,926
Sit down!

1171
01:12:50,927 --> 01:12:52,661
Please, I just need
to speak to Mr. Wolf.

1172
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:54,359
- Mr. Wolf! Mr. Wolf!
- Sit down.

1173
01:12:54,394 --> 01:12:56,596
Please just let me
talk, Mr. Rabbit.

1174
01:12:56,631 --> 01:12:59,115
Please... Please I need
to speak to...

1175
01:12:59,116 --> 01:13:00,274
Oh! Jesus!

1176
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:02,404
Mr. Wolf! Please,

1177
01:13:02,815 --> 01:13:04,949
I think I should be the one
who's spared here.

1178
01:13:04,984 --> 01:13:07,692
I know things about
the bank that could help you!

1179
01:13:07,693 --> 01:13:09,644
- Please, Mr. Wolf!
- What's the problem, brother?

1180
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:11,796
Nothing! He's freaking out!
I got him. Hey!

1181
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:12,866
Hey!

1182
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:15,795
Let me out!
Please let me out!

1183
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:18,068
- Please let me out! Help me!
- Leave him alone!

1184
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:20,320
I gotta get out of here!

1185
01:13:20,365 --> 01:13:21,513
Down! Get down!

1186
01:13:22,218 --> 01:13:23,027
No!

1187
01:13:23,163 --> 01:13:24,333
Down! Get down!

1188
01:13:24,334 --> 01:13:25,553
- I gotta get out of here! Please!
- Get down.

1189
01:13:25,554 --> 01:13:26,551
Down!

1190
01:13:28,444 --> 01:13:33,291
- All right, Mr. Shelton. Calm down.
- No, please. Don't kill me, Mr Wolf!

1191
01:13:33,346 --> 01:13:35,381
You need me, Mr. Wolf.
You need me.

1192
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:38,342
I need you, I do.
I need you to calm down.

1193
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:43,337
Are you calm?
Do not move.

1194
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:47,253
You need me.

1195
01:13:57,423 --> 01:14:00,945
Mr. Wolf. I'm the logical choice.

1196
01:14:01,517 --> 01:14:04,646
If it comes to it, choose me.

1197
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:36,950
Two minutes before the hour's up, Cap.

1198
01:14:36,951 --> 01:14:38,976
What's your play?

1199
01:15:06,028 --> 01:15:08,187
One minute, Cap.

1200
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:58,138
45 seconds.
What is your move?

1201
01:15:59,933 --> 01:16:01,820
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1202
01:16:02,497 --> 01:16:03,475
Here.

1203
01:16:06,865 --> 01:16:09,933
Note the apostrophe
at the end of Marcos'.

1204
01:16:09,968 --> 01:16:12,350
After the S apostrophe
is the most commonly used

1205
01:16:12,385 --> 01:16:14,597
to form possessive
plurals of nouns.

1206
01:16:14,632 --> 01:16:16,809
As was the intention with Marcos'.

1207
01:16:16,844 --> 01:16:19,552
However, there is only one Marco.

1208
01:16:19,587 --> 01:16:23,721
There's no Uncle Marco, cousin Marco,
or friend Marco.

1209
01:16:23,722 --> 01:16:25,584
It's a singular.

1210
01:16:25,619 --> 01:16:29,058
Therefore, the apostrophe...

1211
01:16:29,059 --> 01:16:34,269
should come before the goddamned "S!"

1212
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:36,077
As such.

1213
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:08,516
Mr. Bernard,
you can stand up, Mr. Bernard.

1214
01:17:10,145 --> 01:17:12,384
Mr. Bernard,
please stand up.

1215
01:17:12,385 --> 01:17:14,331
It's okay. It's okay, man.

1216
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:19,329
Go sit down.

1217
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,789
It's gonna be all right, man.

1218
01:17:42,058 --> 01:17:43,820
Bernard...

1219
01:17:44,502 --> 01:17:47,368
where did you find
the strength for that?

1220
01:17:48,676 --> 01:17:53,417
I came out of the closet
in '53, Mr. Shelton.

1221
01:17:59,011 --> 01:18:01,482
One hostage. Now.

1222
01:18:02,063 --> 01:18:04,547
That's right.
A deal's a deal, man.

1223
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:19,050
He's got control now, Cap.

1224
01:18:20,594 --> 01:18:25,203
I saved another life.
That's what counts.

1225
01:18:25,204 --> 01:18:26,893
You.

1226
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:28,981
You, Mr. Sabian.

1227
01:18:29,122 --> 01:18:32,762
- What? I didn't do anything.
- I know. You're going home.

1228
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:38,483
I told you specifically not to make
any moves without consulting me.

1229
01:18:38,518 --> 01:18:42,216
You weren't here. I didn't have
time to seek advice.

1230
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:44,116
Yeah? Well, guess what?

1231
01:18:44,151 --> 01:18:47,760
The powers that be are now fully aware
that you folded to a death threat.

1232
01:18:47,843 --> 01:18:51,267
Convincing everyone this is
going to drag out indefinitely.

1233
01:18:51,302 --> 01:18:54,850
The commissioner wants a full report
of your exchanges with Wolf.

1234
01:18:54,851 --> 01:18:55,978
Fine.

1235
01:18:56,013 --> 01:19:00,518
Congratulations, Cali.
You just all shit over your own dinner.

1236
01:19:00,519 --> 01:19:02,560
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying with my son.

1237
01:19:02,595 --> 01:19:05,210
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying
with my son. But you gotta go.

1238
01:19:05,211 --> 01:19:06,585
- It's gotta be you. I'm sorry,
- Why?

1239
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:09,435
Take anyone else, please.
You need my son.

1240
01:19:09,436 --> 01:19:10,924
- Dad.
- You need him.

1241
01:19:14,509 --> 01:19:18,669
- I'm gonna tell!
- No, you're not gonna tell anybody!

1242
01:19:18,878 --> 01:19:21,869
Mr. Sabian. Mr. Sabian!

1243
01:19:25,683 --> 01:19:27,207
It's all right.

1244
01:19:38,575 --> 01:19:41,894
Movement.
Someone's coming out.

1245
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:48,039
I ask for a boy,
I get a middle-aged fat man.

1246
01:20:00,821 --> 01:20:05,330
Negotiator did not request
Ashley's release.

1247
01:20:22,219 --> 01:20:27,167
Why would Wolf release you, Mr. Sabian?
Why not your son?

1248
01:20:28,253 --> 01:20:29,939
I have no idea.

1249
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:33,481
He was adamant about
not releasing your boy.

1250
01:20:33,516 --> 01:20:35,614
You have no idea why?

1251
01:20:35,615 --> 01:20:39,368
I believe he thinks that...
holding Robby

1252
01:20:39,403 --> 01:20:43,122
will keep you guys from storming
the bank. I don't know. I don't know.

1253
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:47,432
Excuse me. Finish
debriefing Mr. Sabian.

1254
01:20:47,433 --> 01:20:48,921
- Yeah.
- I'll see what this is about.

1255
01:20:50,422 --> 01:20:53,532
Sir? Is this the FBI backup team?

1256
01:20:53,567 --> 01:20:58,065
Special Agent Kerry Southwell.
She died a couple of hours ago.

1257
01:20:58,066 --> 01:20:59,620
Brass is furious.

1258
01:20:59,655 --> 01:21:03,133
They're bringing someone in from
Washington who should be here shortly.

1259
01:21:03,134 --> 01:21:05,613
As of now, you're secondary negotiator.

1260
01:21:05,614 --> 01:21:07,166
- Secondary negotiator?
- That's right.

1261
01:21:07,201 --> 01:21:09,392
I just got another
hostage out alive.

1262
01:21:09,393 --> 01:21:11,201
Doesn't matter.
Everyone inside that bank

1263
01:21:11,236 --> 01:21:13,010
is now in more danger
because of you.

1264
01:21:13,011 --> 01:21:14,572
Why, because I disobeyed an order?

1265
01:21:14,573 --> 01:21:16,273
You're not untouchable because
of your high success rate.

1266
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:19,007
My perfect success rate.
Please tell me this has nothing to do

1267
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:21,165
- with Alan Beck's influence.
- Piss off the right people,

1268
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,313
- politics prevail.
- I'm not a politician,

1269
01:21:23,314 --> 01:21:27,086
- I'm a negotiator.
- You're a secondary negotiator.

1270
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:30,370
In consultant capacity.

1271
01:21:30,598 --> 01:21:32,986
Connie's team will remain primary.

1272
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:35,326
Answering to the FBI.

1273
01:21:36,547 --> 01:21:39,852
<i>News 14 has learned that
the FBI agent wounded

1274
01:21:39,887 --> 01:21:43,225
during the shootout today
at Three Rivers Trust has died

1275
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:44,416
<i>at Mercy Hospital.

1276
01:21:44,451 --> 01:21:46,159
Two people dead at our hands now.

1277
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,663
How does this change things?

1278
01:21:47,664 --> 01:21:49,162
Well, the FBI's gonna get involved.

1279
01:21:49,163 --> 01:21:51,460
Just gonna have a lot less time
than I thought.

1280
01:21:51,663 --> 01:21:53,163
Mr. Wolf?

1281
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:56,395
- It's all set.
- You did it.

1282
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:57,721
Everything's ready to go.

1283
01:21:57,722 --> 01:22:00,430
The Blackberry is on
an unblocked frequency now

1284
01:22:00,465 --> 01:22:03,232
You just have to wait for the other guy
to switch to the new frequency.

1285
01:22:03,267 --> 01:22:04,333
And then you can talk to him.

1286
01:22:04,368 --> 01:22:07,178
Right now, we can email
him if you want to.

1287
01:22:07,213 --> 01:22:09,997
Good work, man.
Good work.

1288
01:22:11,787 --> 01:22:14,364
You gotta know that I had no choice
about your dad, all right?

1289
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:16,147
You just gotta understand
that for me.

1290
01:22:16,182 --> 01:22:18,686
And also know that your dad
begged me to send you out.

1291
01:22:18,785 --> 01:22:20,620
Just rember that.

1292
01:22:34,036 --> 01:22:35,974
You know that note you wrote for me?

1293
01:22:35,975 --> 01:22:37,410
I didn't have to kill the old man

1294
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:39,538
because the cops believed
I was gonna do it.

1295
01:22:39,539 --> 01:22:41,450
Were you?

1296
01:22:44,723 --> 01:22:46,945
Were you really gonna kill him?

1297
01:22:47,341 --> 01:22:50,264
I don't feel anything
when I take a human life.

1298
01:22:51,064 --> 01:22:52,257
Nothing.

1299
01:22:52,318 --> 01:22:56,242
What kind of man doesn't
feel anything? You tell me.

1300
01:23:03,557 --> 01:23:05,609
Bernard Kuzmicki?

1301
01:23:05,644 --> 01:23:07,661
Look, sir.

1302
01:23:07,662 --> 01:23:10,350
You feel any chest pains,
you gotta tell me, okay?

1303
01:23:10,351 --> 01:23:12,632
Talk to me, all right?

1304
01:23:12,662 --> 01:23:13,662
And Leroy,

1305
01:23:13,663 --> 01:23:15,924
your ulcer starts acting up,
man, speak up, bro.

1306
01:23:15,959 --> 01:23:17,611
All right?

1307
01:23:18,038 --> 01:23:20,249
Henry.
I got good news for you, man.

1308
01:23:20,284 --> 01:23:22,660
Your dad's out of surgery
and he's feeling fine.

1309
01:23:22,727 --> 01:23:24,161
He's great.

1310
01:23:24,162 --> 01:23:25,288
All right?

1311
01:23:25,289 --> 01:23:29,591
Anybody else got any ailments
or problems, come to me.

1312
01:23:29,626 --> 01:23:31,100
Got it?

1313
01:23:37,873 --> 01:23:39,035
Hey, baby.

1314
01:23:39,036 --> 01:23:40,888
I know. I'm sorry to wake you.

1315
01:23:41,162 --> 01:23:42,536
I just...

1316
01:23:42,537 --> 01:23:44,677
I just wanted to hear your voice.

1317
01:23:45,849 --> 01:23:48,528
How you feeling?
Any kicking?

1318
01:23:50,036 --> 01:23:52,031
No, no.

1319
01:23:52,348 --> 01:23:56,078
I just wanted to say hi
to both of you.

1320
01:24:00,914 --> 01:24:02,414
Mr. Sabian.

1321
01:24:05,224 --> 01:24:07,168
Mr. Sabian, I'm Alan Beck.

1322
01:24:08,913 --> 01:24:11,525
Can you tell me how my daughter is?

1323
01:24:11,786 --> 01:24:14,646
She's fine.
They haven't hurt her.

1324
01:24:15,226 --> 01:24:16,948
Thank you, Mr. Sabian.

1325
01:24:17,538 --> 01:24:20,038
Now, what is it you need to tell me?

1326
01:24:22,475 --> 01:24:26,322
Mr. Wolf has a message for you.

1327
01:24:26,357 --> 01:24:33,129
Your daughter gave Mr. Wolf your
email address and your cell number.

1328
01:24:33,349 --> 01:24:37,816
And if you follow these instructions,
Mr. Wolf will get in touch with you.

1329
01:24:38,664 --> 01:24:43,255
If you don't, and one of us
goes to the police,

1330
01:24:44,289 --> 01:24:49,617
then your daughter and my son
will not make it out of the bank alive.

1331
01:25:06,248 --> 01:25:08,891
What a handsome bunch of bastards.

1332
01:25:08,926 --> 01:25:11,535
Platoon 1013 back in action.

1333
01:25:11,788 --> 01:25:13,536
Thanks for coming so quick.

1334
01:25:13,537 --> 01:25:15,887
Hey, Sarge needs us.

1335
01:25:17,043 --> 01:25:19,059
Let's get our boys home.

1336
01:25:22,538 --> 01:25:24,371
Next on The Kill Point...

1337
01:25:24,664 --> 01:25:27,751
- I like watching you sleep.
- You say that to all the girls?

1338
01:25:27,786 --> 01:25:30,839
If she stays in there too long,
she's gonna try something.

1339
01:25:30,874 --> 01:25:33,491
- This is Agent Ashe with the FBI.
- FBI.

1340
01:25:33,526 --> 01:25:36,038
I think it's time we took matters
into our own hands.

1341
01:25:36,073 --> 01:25:37,287
Your job here is done.

1342
01:25:37,288 --> 01:25:38,911
It's called psychological warfare.

1343
01:25:38,912 --> 01:25:40,727
They spent winters in Fallujah

1344
01:25:40,728 --> 01:25:43,636
with bombs going off as they slept.

1345
01:25:44,788 --> 01:25:46,333
Keep your eye on the door.
We're coming out.

1346
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:48,831
All teams ready.
Wolf's coming out of the bank.

1347
01:25:49,226 --> 01:25:50,572
Sniper on the rooftop.

1348
01:25:50,607 --> 01:25:52,519
Go! Go!

1349
01:25:52,817 --> 01:25:54,707
I'm gonna put blood on your hands!
