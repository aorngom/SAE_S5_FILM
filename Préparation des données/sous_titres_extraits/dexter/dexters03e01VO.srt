00:01:55,688 --> 00:01:58,104
- <i>Last season on</i> Dexter...
- <i>The butchered bodies</i>

3
00:01:58,264 --> 00:02:00,694
<i>were submerged
inside these garbage bags.</i>

4
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:03,410
Did you hear that? 30 bags!
Know what that means?

5
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,797
There might be a new mass murderer 
worse than the Ice-Truck Killer.

6
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:10,583
8 confirmed victims
of the Bay Harbor Butcher.

7
00:02:10,743 --> 00:02:13,119
That's how the press calls whoever
dumped these bodies offshore.

8
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:15,422
Last thing Miami needs
is another serial killer.

9
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:19,559
- Any idea who the FBI is sending?
- Some guy named Lundy.

10
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,295
We have positive IDs on all 18
of our complete bodies.

11
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,066
All 13 were either tried for murder
or at least suspected of murder.

12
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:29,569
Bay Harbor Butcher. Give me one shot,
I put a bullet in the fucker's head.

13
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:33,039
- You really feel that way?
- Dad taught us the value of human life.

14
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,375
<i>Yeah, but we had different
homework assignments.</i>

15
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:39,546
Tell me the truth.

16
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,548
Are you an addict?

17
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:43,983
Yes, I have an addiction.
I'm Dexter.

18
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:46,252
- Hi, Dexter.
- There's my sponsor.

19
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:51,091
So tell me.
Exactly, how full of shit are you?

20
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:52,759
<i>This woman sees me.</i>

21
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,096
<i>Somehow she's able to make
me feel okay about what I am.</i>

22
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:59,666
You're going to tell me
all your deepest, darkest secrets.

23
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:02,790
<i>Laura Moser, my mother.
She was murdered.</i>

24
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:05,004
I never told anyone that before.

25
00:03:05,164 --> 00:03:09,017
Did you find what happened to the man
responsible for your mother's murder?

26
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:10,431
Santos Jiminez.

27
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:12,745
He turned evidence,
went into witness protection.

28
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:16,228
- Where are you?
- Looking up someone from my past.

29
00:03:16,522 --> 00:03:17,717
1973!

30
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:21,375
You slaughtered her
'cause she stole your cocaine.

31
00:03:21,495 --> 00:03:24,309
She was a snitch for the cop.
She was fucking him.

32
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:26,213
<i>It seems that my foster father</i>

33
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:28,564
<i>and my biological mother
were having an affair.</i>

34
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:30,797
<i>Did he blame himself for her death?</i>

35
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:34,621
<i>Is that why he took me in? Or was he 
using her? Was he using me?</i>

36
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:37,504
No paper trail on the early years
of Dexter Morgan.

37
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:40,106
Your past is a bigger mystery
than Jimmy Hoffa.

38
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,530
Back... off.

39
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:49,382
If Dexter files a complaint,

40
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:52,519
- you'll be kicked out the force.
- He's hiding something.

41
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:54,187
I need some blood  analyzed.

42
00:03:54,347 --> 00:03:56,656
I'm about to be found at work
for what I really am.

43
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:59,450
- You don't understand.
- Why don't you make me?

44
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:07,000
Who are you?

45
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:09,636
Pardon my tits.

46
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:12,388
How can you do this to Rita,
not to mention her kids?

47
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:15,008
You and Lila stayed
in a hotel together.

48
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,631
It's over, Dexter!

49
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:21,581
I'm sure you heard we have a suspect
on the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

50
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:23,016
Sgt James Doakes.

51
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:26,974
- He had the slides.
- Hidden in his car at the airport.

52
00:04:27,355 --> 00:04:29,756
Jesus, Morgan.
<i>You'</i>re the Bay Harbor Butcher!

53
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:31,812
You might wanna check with Lundy.

54
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:40,600
What's it gonna be, Morgan?
Kill me now or set me free!

55
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,403
Don't worry, I'll send the FBI
your way soon enough.

56
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:46,186
- Still gonna frame me.
- <i>Mission accomplished.</i>

57
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:48,875
After tomorrow, I'll be out of reach,
permanently.

58
00:04:49,516 --> 00:04:51,878
- You're going somewhere?
- Good-bye, Lila.

59
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:56,249
<i>Welcome.
Previous destinations.</i>

60
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,008
<i>Starting route guidance.</i>

61
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,055
- Anybody out there?
- Who put you in there?

62
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:03,256
Dexter Morgan.

63
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:06,488
I found out  he's the Butcher.
Please, open the gate!

64
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:09,729
- Poor thing, all alone.
- I'm okay.

65
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:10,991
Not you.

66
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,637
What are you doing?
Turn that off!

67
00:05:17,928 --> 00:05:19,305
This is murder!

68
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:28,717
What were you thinking?
Are you insane?

69
00:05:28,837 --> 00:05:31,054
I was trying to put us back
together again.

70
00:05:31,304 --> 00:05:33,633
<i>The Lila experiment
is officially over.</i>

71
00:05:33,753 --> 00:05:35,336
Could have had it all.

72
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,691
<i>I never put much weight
into the idea of a higher power.</i>

73
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:53,906
<i>But if I didn't know better,
I'd have to believe that some force</i>

74
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:56,930
<i>wants me to keep doing
what I'm doing.</i>

75
00:05:57,182 --> 00:06:00,553
You wanted to be close to me.
This is the most I have to offer.

76
00:06:00,673 --> 00:06:02,636
You told me to accept what I am.

77
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,485
Thank you.

78
00:06:06,864 --> 00:06:09,288
<i>The code is mine now.
And mine alone.</i>

79
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:12,363
<i>So too are the relationships
I cultivate.</i>

80
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:16,478
<i>My father might not approve,
but I'm no longer his disciple.</i>

81
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:18,431
<i>I'm a master now.</i>

82
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:22,803
<i>An idea transcended into life.</i>

83
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:33,064
<i>Life...</i>

84
00:06:33,465 --> 00:06:34,735
<i>Life is ritual,</i>

85
00:06:35,524 --> 00:06:36,470
<i>routine,</i>

86
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:38,242
<i>control.</i>

87
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,941
<i>And an essential part
of that routine:</i>

88
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:46,346
<i>regular oral hygiene.</i>

89
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,008
Here we go.

90
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:53,460
A few minutes
and then I'm right out.

91
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:56,936
So...
how was your summer, Dexter?

92
00:06:57,894 --> 00:06:59,623
I went to the carnival.

93
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:02,996
I even won a prize.

94
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,683
Hope you stayed away
from all those sweets.

95
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,104
I usually am...

96
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:10,504
good, but sometimes, I indulge.

97
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:16,344
I also made it a point
to meet new people.

98
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:21,715
Never have too many friends.
This temporary crown

99
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:24,229
is gonna go way in the back,
so there may be some blood.

100
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:26,454
Not a problem.

101
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:30,153
- So you still have your boat?
- You bet!

102
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,960
That's the only place I can really
let everything go.

103
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:37,947
That's great. Gonna have you up
and out on that water in no time.

104
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:01,559
<i>For someone who needs to spend
his life pretending to be normal,</i>

105
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,602
<i>I've been able to finally...</i>

106
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:05,052
<i>settle in...</i>

107
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:07,098
<i>to a nice,</i>

108
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:08,802
<i>normal world.</i>

109
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:34,755
<i>And Rita is the scaffolding
that holds that world in place.</i>

110
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:36,724
What are you thinking?

111
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:41,792
Life is good.

112
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:53,048
There you go, buddy.
Astor, you're up.

113
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:57,411
- Mickey Mouse, unicorns or starfish?
- Just plain round pancakes, Dexter.

114
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:00,280
She's growing up.

115
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,029
Starts with pancakes?

116
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:05,485
It starts where its starts.

117
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:11,804
Can you come to Dad Day
at my school tomorrow?

118
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:18,268
Just tell me what to do.

119
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:31,470
There's Charlotte.

120
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,680
Bye, mom. See you, Dexter.

121
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:35,494
Get your bag!

122
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:46,670
You hear that?

123
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:48,929
Hear what?

124
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,182
The calm.

125
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:57,079
Everything's falling into place
for the first time in my life.

126
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,547
I got these terrific kids.

127
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:02,355
There's no more drama haunting me,

128
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:05,020
and I have this great,

129
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:07,706
generous, gentle guy.

130
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:17,454
<i>Most normal people
enjoy a secret pact with society.</i>

131
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:20,706
<i>Live a good life and society
will take care of you.</i>

132
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:25,017
<i>But if society drops the ball, then
someone else has to pick up the slack.</i>

133
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:27,054
<i>That's where I come in.</i>

134
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:30,231
<i>Fred Bowman, AKA "Freebo"</i>

135
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:33,721
<i>kills two college girls and escapes
on a state police screw-up,</i>

136
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,522
<i>otherwise known as Florida's
"catch and release program".</i>

137
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:39,774
<i>He does the deed,
gets away with murder,</i>

138
00:10:39,894 --> 00:10:41,444
<i>and falls off the radar.</i>

139
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:43,596
<i>Everyone's radar but mine.</i>

140
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:48,723
You got a birthday coming up, dad.

141
00:10:48,988 --> 00:10:51,604
<i>What to get to the man
who had everything?</i>

142
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,906
<i>How about</i>

143
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,124
<i>Freebo?</i>

144
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:05,803
- Good morning, Dex.
- <i>Dexter, the donut guy.</i>

145
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:07,787
<i>Part of my routine.</i>

146
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:12,246
<i>But let the record show, I'm not
the only one with a daily ritual.</i>

Better than sex.

152
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:25,771
Actually, no, it's not.

153
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:29,615
I need a favor. You think you could

154
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:31,726
proof an article I'm writing for FQ?

155
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:33,856
- Forensic Quarterly.
- Right. Yeah.

156
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:35,736
O'Malley reached out
'cause I was the LFI.

157
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:37,678
- Lead Forensic Investigator.
- On the BHB.

158
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:38,957
Bay Harbor Butcher.

159
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:41,915
No biggie,
I've been published before.

160
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,649
Your <i>Penthouse</i> doesn't count.

161
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,251
Hey, that letter was famous!

162
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,492
Death by pastry.

163
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:49,662
You changed your hair.

164
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,258
- Makes you look younger.
- I don't wanna look younger.

165
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:54,467
Bad call then.

166
00:11:55,317 --> 00:11:57,314
By the way, nice work
on the Renaldi case.

167
00:11:57,434 --> 00:12:00,506
Yeah, well, murder suicide,
pretty straight forward.

168
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:03,442
Still, I mean, your report
was spot on, right?

169
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:09,870
Alright.

170
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:13,185
Quinn's been in homicide 2 weeks
and he noticed.

171
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:16,254
- Notice what?
- My hair.

172
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:20,993
I changed my hair style
for the first time since I was eight.

173
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:23,675
Short...

174
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:25,714
... er, shorter.

175
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:29,596
And Quinn's just showing off
his detective skills.

176
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,705
You think he thinks I'm a potential lay?
That is not happening.

177
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:35,007
You also not noticed

178
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:37,910
that I've given up man liquor
and smokes for the last 27 days.

179
00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:42,856
This is you remembering
dad's birthday, is that right?

180
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,717
Dad's birthday, right.

181
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:47,086
Blue Room, 07:30, like always.

182
00:12:50,345 --> 00:12:51,878
I tried calling you last night.

183
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:53,160
I wasn't home.

184
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,051
I also tried your cell phone

185
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,182
You're wearing the same pants
than yesterday.

186
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:02,785
- And that shirt's your back up one.
- <i>Ayuda-me aquí.</i>

187
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:05,654
I though part of your restructuring
our department

188
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:08,342
was you staying out
of our personal lives.

189
00:13:08,462 --> 00:13:10,092
Anything you want me to know?

190
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:11,444
Know this.

191
00:13:11,845 --> 00:13:15,257
I went out and had a great time last
night, and you should be happy for me.

192
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,182
Besides,

193
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,520
since when do you care?

194
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:21,736
Since this.

195
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:22,832
Follow me.

196
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:30,586
Okay guys, listen up.

197
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:32,955
I just got word

198
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,767
from upstairs that

199
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:38,090
Angel will no longer be
detective Batista.

200
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,685
What?

201
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,541
In two days, he will be

202
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:43,909
detective sergeant

203
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:45,153
Batista.

204
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,283
Sorry all the red tape
and the hoops, but...

205
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:53,486
nobody deserves it
more than you, Angel.

206
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,826
When this is really official,

207
00:13:58,147 --> 00:14:00,752
when I can trade this in
for that gold badge,

208
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,329
drinks are on me.

209
00:14:11,522 --> 00:14:14,119
Angel gets his wings,
you know what this means?

210
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:15,214
Pay raise?

211
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:18,010
No, deal dope.
It means he's my supervisor.

212
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:21,251
Which mean I'm in luck
for my detective shield.

213
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:25,381
- Where are you going?
- On a research.

214
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:30,556
Typos, grammar,
something could be clearer, whatever.

215
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:32,397
Hair cut!

216
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:36,182
Yep.

217
00:14:41,634 --> 00:14:44,655
<i>Time to get the lay of the land
on Freebo and his...</i>

218
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:46,586
<i>pink house.</i>

219
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:10,659
Freebo. I need Freebo.

220
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,332
You know him how?

221
00:15:13,988 --> 00:15:15,835
He sells the best shit
anywhere around.

222
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:18,853
Come on, man.
What? You googled him or something?

223
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:21,217
You know what? Fuck it.

224
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,491
- There are other dope spots.
- Come here!

225
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:25,693
Don't walk away all fuck you on me.

226
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:37,957
- <i>What?</i>
- Ding, ding!

227
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,458
I'm looking to hold some product.

228
00:15:59,703 --> 00:16:02,063
Ordinarily,
I don't accept new clientele,

229
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:05,066
but I've had a dissolutely
third quarter.

230
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:08,336
Come on!

231
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:13,174
You need a little more hook
before breaking into the pocket.

232
00:16:16,482 --> 00:16:20,048
You know I bought this TV for 6 grand,
but I'll let you have it for three.

233
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:22,851
I'm more interested
in scoring some tar.

234
00:16:24,014 --> 00:16:26,245
Another yuppie
turns to the dark side.

235
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:31,245
- I need a hit.
- Jeez, Teagan, I'm transacting here.

236
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:34,046
- One toot.
- Did you hear what I said?

237
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:35,970
Fuck off, Teagan.

238
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:38,890
Fine, I guess your dick
can suck itself from now on.

239
00:16:44,577 --> 00:16:47,542
Stupid cunt is going
to redefine short term relationship.

240
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:49,752
Catch my drift?

241
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,385
Yeah, I catch your drift.

242
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:54,675
<i>And I'm entirely confident
you've earned the privilege</i>

243
00:16:54,795 --> 00:16:57,031
<i>of being re-purposed as fish food.</i>

244
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:07,695
<i>Narcotics raided this place
at noon today.</i>

245
00:17:10,749 --> 00:17:13,999
<i>The drug rats won't return
to their nest for a while.</i>

246
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:25,873
<i>Plenty of time to...</i>

247
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:28,427
<i>do what I have to do.</i>

248
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,308
Raw, you like it raw.

249
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:39,645
- Excuse me?
- No sugar.

250
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:41,653
You like the raw stuff.

251
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,250
It's my job to notice things.

252
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:45,767
Morgan, right?

253
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,021
- Do I know you?
- New hair cut, it's cute.

254
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,489
. Who the fuck are you?

255
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:53,975
Yuki Amado, internal affairs.

256
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,880
And?

257
00:17:56,624 --> 00:17:57,997
Do you know a Joey Quinn?

258
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:02,054
- Why?
- Well,

259
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,290
he started drawing our attention
back when he was in narcotics.

260
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,087
He's in your orbit now.

261
00:18:08,257 --> 00:18:10,496
I don't know the guy
except he handle my paperwork.

262
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,801
It'd be really cool if you could get
next to him, you know,

263
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:16,048
- do a little recon.
- Are you high?

264
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,465
No. Never been.

265
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:19,934
Well...

266
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,055
Yuki, that's not gonna happen.

267
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,951
Cooperation with IA
has its upside in the department.

268
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:28,894
- Yeah, maybe for rodents.
- Okay.

269
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,732
Well, it was nice to finally meet you
in person, you know.

270
00:18:34,966 --> 00:18:35,773
Bye.

271
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,737
And what is it you think
Quinn did exactly?

272
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:44,743
You don't get to blow me off
and still ask questions.

273
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,882
<i>Loud music, cover of darkness...</i>

274
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:01,346
<i>Perfect.</i>

275
00:19:44,353 --> 00:19:45,967
Freebo, get back here!

276
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:04,813
Who are you?

277
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:06,125
Who are <i>you</i>?

278
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:11,327
Shit!

279
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:16,619
Yo! Freebo, man?

280
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:28,963
<i>What the fuck happened back there?</i>

281
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:32,930
<i>I went to kill Freebo and ended up
killing a total stranger.</i>

282
00:20:34,062 --> 00:20:36,637
<i>I've never killed anyone
I didn't completely bet before</i>

283
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:39,515
<i>whose guilt
I wasn't absolutely certain of.</i>

284
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:42,391
<i>I did something
wholly inside the moment</i>

285
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:44,296
<i>and wholly outside the code.</i>

286
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:48,389
<i>Something...</i>

287
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,747
<i>spontaneous.</i>

288
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:52,871
<i>Who did I just kill?</i>

289
00:20:55,238 --> 00:20:56,689
<i>Freebo's doorman...</i>

290
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:58,976
<i>I... am... fucked.</i>

291
00:21:01,976 --> 00:21:04,954
<i>Just a matter of time
before someone calls it in.</i>

292
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:11,256
- Hey, you.
- <i>Dexter, hey.</i>

293
00:21:12,152 --> 00:21:15,182
I know it's not
one of our regular nights, but...

294
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:18,720
- Can you come over?
- Sure. Everything OK?

295
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:21,315
<i>Yeah, I just...</i>

296
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,536
Just missing you, that's all.

297
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,539
God, you're on fire lately.

298
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:33,864
Are you complaining?

299
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:36,973
I'm complying.

300
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:48,536
Hey, where are you?

301
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:50,940
On my dear.

302
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:55,203
A safe place.

303
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,449
God created pudding,

304
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,144
and then he rested.

305
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,250
Pudding of chocolate,

306
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,026
manna from heaven.

307
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:19,251
What are the kids
gonna do for dessert tomorrow?

308
00:22:21,202 --> 00:22:22,294
Tangerines.

309
00:22:37,603 --> 00:22:40,396
Yes, I'm happy
with my long distance provider.

310
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:46,308
What the hell ever happened to
"Do not call, it's 3 in the morning?"

311
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:48,704
Not in India.

312
00:22:53,103 --> 00:22:55,685
I have an insanely busy morning
tomorrow,

313
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:58,750
so I'll be gone
before you and the kids wake up.

314
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:03,557
Dexter, you've been working
such killer hours lately.

315
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,768
Just hold me till you have to go.

316
00:23:23,677 --> 00:23:25,726
Just a matter of time...

317
00:23:34,477 --> 00:23:35,591
'Morning, Sergeant.

318
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:38,263
<i>How long for you
to get to 118 Countant?</i>

319
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:41,758
Twenty, thirty minutes.

320
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:54,708
I got it, Dex.

321
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:55,880
Got what?

322
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,940
Only the case
that's gonna get me my shield.

323
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,274
It's huge. Angel put me on it.
Officially on it.

324
00:24:00,895 --> 00:24:01,751
"Huge"?

325
00:24:09,692 --> 00:24:11,103
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

326
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:13,544
I bet your wondering
who the hell he is.

327
00:24:15,048 --> 00:24:17,325
Who he is
is what makes this case huge.

328
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:18,874
It's Miguel Prado.

329
00:24:18,994 --> 00:24:22,381
He's a ADA. He was put on a mission
to put away as many bad guys as he can.

330
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,716
You know,
"A safe Miami is the only Miami."

331
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:28,520
A safe Miami
and we're all unemployed.

332
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,889
Why does he look so familiar?

333
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:35,360
'Cause he just made the cover
of <i>Florida Magazine</i>.

334
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:38,463
Top prosecutor in the state
three years in a row.

335
00:24:38,623 --> 00:24:41,700
He and LaGuerta go way back, you know.
The whole Cubano thing.

336
00:24:42,963 --> 00:24:44,703
The other guy is Ramon Prado.

337
00:24:44,863 --> 00:24:48,053
Miguel's middle brother.
He's a Lt with the sheriff's department.

338
00:24:48,173 --> 00:24:51,392
Made himself quite the reputation
for being a law and order hardass.

339
00:24:51,785 --> 00:24:52,602
And...

340
00:24:53,922 --> 00:24:54,697
Oscar.

341
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:56,846
Prado?

342
00:24:57,294 --> 00:24:58,831
As in baby brother.

343
00:25:00,035 --> 00:25:01,696
<i>So much for spontaneity.</i>

344
00:25:02,728 --> 00:25:04,772
What was he doing
in a dump like this?

345
00:25:05,198 --> 00:25:07,441
They're saying that he was a coach
at a youth club.

346
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,512
He came here to confront this scumbag
about selling shit to his kids.

347
00:25:11,774 --> 00:25:14,195
Talk about wrong place
at the wrong time.

348
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:15,717
Tell me about it.

349
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:24,555
Find anything?

350
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,246
A dead guy with a hole in his chest.

351
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,379
If this window was cracked
since there's blood on the wall,

352
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:46,120
- who shut these drapes?
- Probably the 1st on scene.

353
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,549
Some dipshit rookie
who's still outside puking.

354
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:07,551
So what do we got?

355
00:26:08,913 --> 00:26:12,063
Signs of a majorly big struggle
here, there, everywhere.

356
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:14,810
Single stab wound to the chest.
You read my article yet?

357
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:17,845
- Started it. So far it's really good.
- Awesome.

358
00:26:37,348 --> 00:26:38,880
Whoever did this...

359
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,302
He's already wishing he was dead.

360
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,728
Someone really stepped on his dick
with this one.

361
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,840
<i>There were so many lessons
in the vaunted code of Harry.</i>

362
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:13,233
<i>Twisted commandments handed down
from the only God I ever worshipped.</i>

363
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:15,823
<i>1 through 10.</i>

364
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:18,383
<i>Don't get caught.</i>

365
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,309
<i>That I got covered.</i>

366
00:27:23,922 --> 00:27:27,139
<i>But killing someone
without knowing if he's guilty...</i>

367
00:27:29,206 --> 00:27:31,291
<i>I'd love some help on this one.</i>

368
00:27:32,714 --> 00:27:34,436
<i>But my God is dead now.</i>

369
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:44,282
Man's best friend. Hey, Dex?

370
00:27:45,962 --> 00:27:46,970
Not today.

371
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,656
My sister said that LaGuerta
knows this Miguel Prado pretty well?

372
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,292
Way back when,

373
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,760
when Mi...

374
00:27:55,226 --> 00:27:56,574
Hey, what's up?

375
00:27:57,446 --> 00:27:59,831
Way back when,
when Miguel was in law school,

376
00:27:59,951 --> 00:28:03,401
and Maria was just starting in law
enforcement, they hooked up.

377
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:04,526
Hooked up?

378
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,260
Between us,

379
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:07,421
for Maria,

380
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:11,042
Miguel Prado will always be
the one that got away.

381
00:28:17,118 --> 00:28:18,453
** has the victim.

382
00:28:18,903 --> 00:28:19,998
Oscar Prado.

383
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,303
26.

384
00:28:21,588 --> 00:28:22,398
Dead.

385
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:25,526
Dead from a single stab wound
to the chest.

386
00:28:25,646 --> 00:28:28,016
The deceased's brother,
A. D. A Miguel Prado,

387
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:29,494
informed me at the scene,

388
00:28:29,996 --> 00:28:33,814
that Oscar went to confront
one Fred Bowman, street name "Freebo"

389
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,875
for selling drugs
to some youth club kids.

390
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:39,474
- Morgan?
- This Freebo's the same guy

391
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:42,232
that killed those 2 coeds
in the Everglades and got away with it.

392
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:45,208
So, the way it looks,
Oscar Prado died a hero.

393
00:28:45,401 --> 00:28:47,445
Also, our team
found a shitload of...

394
00:28:48,071 --> 00:28:49,848
substantial amount of drugs
in the house.

395
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,812
Any leads on his whereabouts?

396
00:28:51,932 --> 00:28:54,432
That part of the neighborhood
isn't exactly police-friendly

397
00:28:54,552 --> 00:28:56,955
- but I'm staying on it.
- Talk to me about forensics.

398
00:28:58,501 --> 00:29:00,637
Evidence indicates
this was no hit and run.

399
00:29:00,757 --> 00:29:03,605
It was a furious close-in battle.
Whoever...

400
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:05,597
Or is it whomever?

401
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:07,057
Whoever's good.

402
00:29:07,177 --> 00:29:09,501
Whoever did this got in
a lucky shot or...

403
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:11,403
is really good at handling a blade.

404
00:29:11,614 --> 00:29:13,905
According to the ME,
the aorta was...

405
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:16,574
cleanly severed in one penetration.

406
00:29:16,865 --> 00:29:19,074
- Not easy to do.
- Any luck finding the weapon?

407
00:29:19,194 --> 00:29:20,724
It's not on either premises.

408
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:24,315
We've checked roofs, sewers,
trash bins in a 5-block radius.

409
00:29:24,702 --> 00:29:27,606
Our conclusion:
The assailant took it with him.

410
00:29:27,911 --> 00:29:29,801
Dexter, what's the blood saying?

411
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:32,090
Pretty much what everyone else is.

412
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,260
I have some second-level on scene work
to do. I'll get back to you ASAP.

413
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:37,062
Get it to Sergeant Batista.

414
00:29:37,757 --> 00:29:39,047
Full disclosure.

415
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:43,599
I've had a personal relationship
with the Prado family for many years.

416
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:46,204
And it goes a lot further
than the whole Cubano thing.

417
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:49,602
Sergeant?

418
00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:53,945
Stating the obvious, Lieutenant.
I like Freebo for this.

419
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:55,458
<i>Me too.</i>

420
00:29:56,526 --> 00:29:57,376
Morgan?

421
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,971
Yes, Ma'am.

422
00:29:59,646 --> 00:30:02,612
Hit the streets harder.
Learn what you can learn.

423
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:06,017
All due respect, Lieutenant,

424
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,192
if Freebo did this,
he's not in Miami.

425
00:30:08,312 --> 00:30:09,728
I mean, he's in the wind.

426
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,686
We can sit around on our asses

427
00:30:11,806 --> 00:30:15,277
and speculate on where we think
the prime suspect may or may not be

428
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,879
or we can actually go
and look for him.

429
00:30:21,016 --> 00:30:23,499
As a Miami prosecutor,
I have dedicated

430
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:25,739
my career to fighting crime.

431
00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:29,189
To making our streets safe
for everyone.

432
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:33,887
Every family,
White, Black, Latino, Asian,

433
00:30:34,573 --> 00:30:35,504
deserves

434
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,858
the full measure of our devotion
to their...

435
00:30:39,397 --> 00:30:40,342
dignity.

436
00:30:41,178 --> 00:30:43,278
And now that crime has touched

437
00:30:44,078 --> 00:30:47,082
my family
in the most profound way imaginable,

438
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:50,242
I grieve equally for every family

439
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:52,813
that has been visited
with the same...

440
00:30:53,513 --> 00:30:56,107
unimaginable news
that we have received today.

441
00:30:56,702 --> 00:30:59,312
<i>Our beautiful city
is a city of families.</i>

442
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:00,932
<i>And the...</i>

443
00:31:02,024 --> 00:31:03,432
<i>untimely taking</i>

444
00:31:03,787 --> 00:31:04,859
<i>of any of us</i>

445
00:31:05,177 --> 00:31:06,593
<i>touches all of us.</i>

446
00:31:07,589 --> 00:31:08,564
<i>My parents</i>

447
00:31:09,074 --> 00:31:10,873
<i>brought my brother from...</i>

448
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:14,591
<i>Part of my ritual has always been
getting to know my victims.</i>

449
00:31:15,224 --> 00:31:17,823
<i>Confirming their guilt
beyond all doubt.</i>

450
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:21,663
<i>Oscar Prado tried to kill Freebo.</i>

451
00:31:21,783 --> 00:31:23,368
<i>Then he tried to kill me.</i>

452
00:31:23,488 --> 00:31:25,971
<i>No way he was there
on some noble youth club mission.</i>

453
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:28,267
<i>He's gotta be guilty of something.</i>

454
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,885
<i>Aren't we all?</i>

455
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,856
<i>So I ask again...</i>

456
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,952
Who are you?

457
00:31:43,882 --> 00:31:46,575
Two speeding tickets
and an illegal U-turn.

458
00:31:49,796 --> 00:31:51,563
Talk about outside the code
of Harry.

459
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:55,631
<i>Harry finds me in a pool of blood.</i>

460
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:58,493
<i>Turns me into his own personal
vendetta machine.</i>

461
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:01,813
<i>And when he sees
the monster he created in action...</i>

462
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:03,953
<i>He kills himself.</i>

463
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:06,497
<i>Deb can drink to his honor
on her own.</i>

464
00:32:06,617 --> 00:32:09,407
Any luck in the land
of reluctant witnesses?

465
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,384
One house I play good cop,
the next one I play bad cop,

466
00:32:12,504 --> 00:32:14,983
but I still can't get shit
from anybody in the neighborhood.

467
00:32:15,103 --> 00:32:16,921
You know what the problem is, right?

468
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:18,909
Wait, Quinn. Let me guess.

469
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:20,459
- The cop part.
- Nope.

470
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:23,376
They don't owe you anything.
There's no incentive,

471
00:32:23,496 --> 00:32:26,898
which gives the balance of power
weighing in their direction, right?

472
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:29,781
Here, let me do you a favor.

473
00:32:30,385 --> 00:32:31,618
Call this guy.

474
00:32:32,523 --> 00:32:33,837
Tell him you know me.

475
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,674
Tell him you wanna cash in
one of my coupons.

476
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:38,050
Coupons?

477
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,912
Yeah. He's a CI
from my days in narcotics.

478
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:44,305
You've gotta hook in him
but it's not coming out anytime soon.

479
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,785
- What do you want in return?
- Just remember that I did you a solid.

480
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:53,736
- What, not even a thank you?
- Thank you.

481
00:32:54,696 --> 00:32:56,256
Stop looking at my ass.

482
00:33:12,603 --> 00:33:13,578
Detective.

483
00:33:14,928 --> 00:33:16,293
Officer. You're Anton?

484
00:33:17,418 --> 00:33:18,483
In the flesh.

485
00:33:19,578 --> 00:33:21,468
You got something you wanna show me?

486
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:26,823
Yeah, I've seen him before.

487
00:33:27,324 --> 00:33:29,079
- Really? Where?
- In the news.

488
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,589
Isn't that the guy you let walk
on those coed killings?

489
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:35,600
Now that there
was a fine piece of police work.

490
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:41,756
- You know him from the newspaper?
- Yeah, I think I saw him on CNN.

491
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:44,578
- That's all you got?
- That's all <i>you</i> got?

492
00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:49,488
If it's you and Quinn fucking with me,
I'm really not in the mood.

493
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:52,262
If you need something for that temper,
I got a man down the street

494
00:33:52,382 --> 00:33:54,619
with  real mellow weed
that can take that edge right off.

495
00:33:54,812 --> 00:33:57,232
Thank you, but I don't take advice
from drug dealer, so...

496
00:33:57,352 --> 00:33:58,478
Drug dealer?

497
00:33:58,657 --> 00:33:59,929
No, never that.

498
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:01,960
A drug user.

499
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:04,996
Occasionally.
Strictly weed thought, officer.

500
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,532
Then how did you become
Quinn's snitch?

501
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:09,893
I got caught up in a drug bust.

502
00:34:10,013 --> 00:34:12,330
Quinn said that if I blew
the whistle on a bigger fish

503
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,729
I'd stay out of jail, so I listened.

504
00:34:15,162 --> 00:34:16,229
Attentively.

505
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,662
Yeah, well...

506
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,147
It never hurts an occasional
drug user to have more than 1 friend

507
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:25,360
- on the force, so...
- That's the thing, officer.

508
00:34:25,554 --> 00:34:26,985
I got enough friends.

509
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:31,682
- I'm outta here.
- Well, you have a good one you here.

510
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:41,553
What about this Prado guy?

511
00:34:43,236 --> 00:34:45,386
And to determine the impact site,

512
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:48,896
the exact point
where force encounters a body,

513
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:53,578
you have to distinguish
the geometric differences between

514
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:55,774
a back spatter, a satellite spatter,

515
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:59,350
- misting and arterial spurting.
- Gross!

516
00:34:59,876 --> 00:35:00,843
Shut up!

517
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:04,218
You remember how before,
when Katie's dad

518
00:35:04,338 --> 00:35:06,524
- was talking about being a surgeon.
- Yeah.

519
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,426
And sometimes,

520
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:11,492
how he has to cut into bodies
and there's blood?

521
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:13,161
But he saves lives.

522
00:35:13,777 --> 00:35:15,277
Do you save lives?

523
00:35:19,195 --> 00:35:20,674
You know there's good guys

524
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:23,274
- and bad guys?
- So you catch bad guys?

525
00:35:24,598 --> 00:35:26,210
Not directly, but I help.

526
00:35:26,672 --> 00:35:28,322
Do you have a uniform?

527
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:30,342
A lab coat.

528
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:31,575
A gun?

529
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:35,142
He's got a badge.

530
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,815
It's a laminate.

531
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:42,796
Thank you so much for taking time
from your busy schedule M. Morgan.

532
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:47,084
- To come and talk to the children.
- It was a real learning experience.

533
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:55,995
Looks like
I really got through to them?

534
00:35:56,115 --> 00:35:58,975
It would have sucked even worse
if I hadn't had a dad today.

535
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:03,383
Thanks for inviting me, buddy.

536
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:15,763
<i>If anyone should have father issues,
anger, rejection, abandonment,</i>

537
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:16,994
<i>it's Cody.</i>

538
00:36:17,848 --> 00:36:19,931
<i>And what's does he do?
He moves on.</i>

539
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:25,336
<i>How does that happen?</i>

540
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,848
- I was so bad you're crying?
- No.

541
00:36:35,982 --> 00:36:37,215
No, it's just,

542
00:36:37,335 --> 00:36:39,189
It's just something I always wanted.

543
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:41,204
You being here for the kids.

544
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:44,606
It's all so wonderfully
uncomplicated.

545
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:57,334
<i>M. Morgan, this is Miguel Prado.
I need to see you.</i>

546
00:36:58,348 --> 00:36:59,369
Right away.

547
00:37:05,511 --> 00:37:07,261
<i>So much for uncomplicated.</i>

548
00:37:26,682 --> 00:37:29,514
They're almost
just like a piece of art.

549
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,375
Thank you, sir,

550
00:37:32,495 --> 00:37:34,735
but to me, it's more like a story.

551
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:38,842
Tell me that story M. Morgan.

552
00:37:44,738 --> 00:37:46,355
The encounter started over here.

553
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:49,319
The scuff marks on the linoleum,

554
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:53,833
their crumpling, the throw rug,
they all have a directional quality,

555
00:37:53,953 --> 00:37:55,215
that leads to...

556
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,449
And this,

557
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:59,721
is where your brother and Freebo...

558
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:02,704
He's my lieutenant's prime suspect.

559
00:38:04,945 --> 00:38:06,462
But, you know that.

560
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:10,176
There was a brutal struggle.

561
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:13,778
I gotta say,
it looks like your brother

562
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:15,826
fought like a hero.

563
00:38:17,937 --> 00:38:19,544
But he was overmatched,

564
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:22,514
and sustained a fatal stab wound
to the chest.

565
00:38:26,045 --> 00:38:28,277
Everything about the blood suggest
that your brother

566
00:38:28,397 --> 00:38:30,227
bled out almost instantly.

567
00:38:31,247 --> 00:38:32,634
He didn't suffer?

568
00:38:33,446 --> 00:38:34,811
Blood never lies.

569
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:39,056
So now I know how he died.

570
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:42,806
Question is why.

571
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,234
One more thing, M. Morgan.

572
00:38:47,644 --> 00:38:50,344
Why would a blood spatter analyst

573
00:38:51,421 --> 00:38:54,428
spend time searching the sheriff
department's database for

574
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:56,704
information on my dead brother?

575
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:07,806
Like you sir, I wanted to understand
what happened here.

576
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:09,284
I thought that...

577
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:13,651
knowing some details
about your brother's life would help me

578
00:39:14,231 --> 00:39:15,648
make sense out of his death.

579
00:39:15,768 --> 00:39:17,307
In your line of work, M. Morgan,

580
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:19,114
is it usual for you to

581
00:39:19,801 --> 00:39:21,218
get so involved?

582
00:39:25,852 --> 00:39:28,145
I just sounded
like a prosecutor there.

583
00:39:28,745 --> 00:39:29,745
I'm sorry.

584
00:39:30,215 --> 00:39:31,873
It's not a problem, sir, and no,

585
00:39:31,993 --> 00:39:34,130
it's not usual for me
to get so involved,

586
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,094
but this one, this death,

587
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:37,961
got to me.

588
00:39:42,061 --> 00:39:43,127
It's just...

589
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:45,111
it seems so unreal...

590
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,330
He's gone.

591
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,963
Yeah, I know.

592
00:39:54,547 --> 00:39:56,213
So a man dies, M. Morgan,

593
00:39:56,697 --> 00:40:00,243
and what's left? A soul?
And what is that exactly?

594
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:05,304
- I really couldn't tell you.
- Cause some people say the soul

595
00:40:05,424 --> 00:40:07,020
just lives on forever.

596
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:10,941
I hope not.

597
00:40:11,658 --> 00:40:13,308
Which makes you a cynic.

598
00:40:14,641 --> 00:40:16,191
Makes me a scientist.

599
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,642
So no one you've

600
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:23,242
ever loved hasn't died?

601
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:28,690
My father died
when I was in my twenties.

602
00:40:31,368 --> 00:40:33,151
And you don't believe that

603
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:35,168
that his soul,

604
00:40:36,178 --> 00:40:38,856
or qualities of life force
is still here somehow, it's...

605
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:40,673
living inside you?

606
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,764
Because I...

607
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,930
I should have been there for him.

608
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:55,406
- You can't blame yourself, sir.
- It's easier said than done, M. Morgan.

609
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,865
Do me a favor.

610
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,840
You really wanna get to know
my brother like you say?

611
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,309
Come to his wake tonight.

612
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:09,967
Come see how much and how...

613
00:41:10,823 --> 00:41:11,916
how fully

614
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,507
he was loved.

615
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:18,621
I've taken up enough of your day.

616
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:19,697
Thank you.

617
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:34,483
These reports final?

618
00:41:34,603 --> 00:41:38,294
The blood specimens I collected
all came back belonging to Oscar Prado.

619
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:41,477
Trace prints all around the victim
all point to Freebo.

620
00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:44,312
- Anyone out there talking?
- No officer Morgan was heading up

621
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:48,393
the usual firewall, clammed up
witnesses and non-witnesses, so,

622
00:41:48,513 --> 00:41:50,457
I put her in touch
with an old CI of mine.

623
00:41:50,577 --> 00:41:52,246
- Hopefully, should be...
- Quinn?

624
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:54,965
That CI you put me on
was totally useless for Freebo.

625
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:57,802
- Sadly, it's not a perfect world.
- Yeah.

626
00:41:57,962 --> 00:42:01,033
For all we know,
Freebo is in like Nebraska by now.

627
00:42:01,153 --> 00:42:03,007
I guess you don't owe me
that favor then.

628
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:05,176
- How come he gets favors?
- He doesn't.

629
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:07,889
But what the CI told me
about the victim.

630
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:11,015
He wasn't some hero coach who went
into the hood and took one for the team.

631
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:12,857
What do you mean?

632
00:42:12,977 --> 00:42:16,341
Oscar Prado was into Freebo
for some serious cash.

633
00:42:16,461 --> 00:42:19,776
Why would someone be into, I don't know,
a drug dealer for big bucks?

634
00:42:19,896 --> 00:42:24,261
Because Oscar Prado, the pride
of little Havana, was a fucking junkie.

635
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:30,611
Thanks, Maria.

636
00:42:34,404 --> 00:42:35,773
Good one, Morgan.

637
00:42:53,325 --> 00:42:55,211
She's been in better moods.

638
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:59,252
- I didn't exactly brighten her day.
- No, you didn't.

639
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,810
Excuse me for doing my fucking job.

640
00:43:02,148 --> 00:43:05,526
You've seen any other super cops
coming in here with any leads?

641
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:07,872
No, Deb, you're definitely amazing,

642
00:43:08,032 --> 00:43:10,407
- But you got to...
- I know, I know.

643
00:43:10,917 --> 00:43:13,481
Be aware of my surroundings,
take the temperature of the room

644
00:43:13,601 --> 00:43:16,080
before I open my mouth,
I know it's a bad habit, I admit it.

645
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:18,078
Look on the bright side.

646
00:43:18,198 --> 00:43:20,345
Now that you've given up men,
booze and cigarettes

647
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:23,492
running your mouth
is the only bad habit you have left.

648
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,802
That's right.

649
00:43:25,117 --> 00:43:27,057
I'm a model of fucking perfection.

650
00:43:29,603 --> 00:43:31,822
You remember what today is, right?

651
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,664
How can I forget?

652
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,185
7 h 30, I'll buy our first drink.

653
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,461
- You wanted to see me?
<i>- Sienta-te.</i>

654
00:43:48,155 --> 00:43:50,165
I need you to think about

655
00:43:50,285 --> 00:43:53,551
Deborah Morgan's continued involvement
on the Oscar Prado case.

656
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:59,390
You want me to throw her under the bus
forbeing a little overzealous?

657
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,148
It's not about zeal.

658
00:44:01,268 --> 00:44:03,640
It's about tact and sensitivity.

659
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,905
It's also about the real world.
This case is as high profile as it gets.

660
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:09,434
- Listen...
<i>- No, oye-me, Angel. </i>Morgan is

661
00:44:09,554 --> 00:44:13,704
resourceful and tenacious, and usually
the right amount of pain in the ass.

662
00:44:14,016 --> 00:44:16,040
But there are
political ramifications.

663
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:19,577
And my history with Miguel Prado aside,
this case is just too big for her.

664
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:24,447
Just say the word Maria
and I will follow your orders.

665
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:28,212
Becoming a homicide sergeant
is more than just a bump in pay scale.

666
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,254
It's a quantum leap
in responsibility.

667
00:44:30,661 --> 00:44:32,489
All part of moving up the chain.

668
00:44:34,106 --> 00:44:35,408
If I bounce her,

669
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,463
- she will hate me.
- Your her boss, Angel. Not a friend.

670
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:43,655
That's up to you.

671
00:45:29,388 --> 00:45:32,983
- Can I get another cranberry juice?
- That makes three problems down under.

672
00:45:33,735 --> 00:45:36,098
Jeez,
I like the fucking taste, okay?

673
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:43,856
I miss you dad.

674
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:56,339
- My condolences.
- Thank you for coming.

675
00:45:58,919 --> 00:46:02,075
Losing my brother is gonna leave
a pain in my heart that...

676
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:04,445
I don't think is ever going to heal.

677
00:46:06,462 --> 00:46:08,382
You have a brother, Dexter?

678
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:21,231
No. Just a one loud sister.

679
00:46:21,505 --> 00:46:23,755
What she said back at the station...

680
00:46:24,612 --> 00:46:25,653
It's okay.

681
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,205
I know my brother was a good man.

682
00:46:28,915 --> 00:46:32,710
But I can't say that he suffered
from the tragedy of perfection.

683
00:46:35,511 --> 00:46:36,346
Who does?

684
00:46:38,013 --> 00:46:39,085
Who indeed.

685
00:46:39,961 --> 00:46:41,552
Hey, brother. The mayor's here.

686
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:55,684
<i>You attacked me with a knife
in a dope dealer's house,</i>

687
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:59,983
<i>no Oscar, you certainly did not suffer
from the tragedy of perfection.</i>

688
00:47:01,335 --> 00:47:03,474
<i>Then why does this feel so wrong?</i>

689
00:47:04,637 --> 00:47:07,827
<i>Why in your death
are you still so alive in my life?</i>

690
00:47:10,129 --> 00:47:11,741
Did you know him well?

691
00:47:13,304 --> 00:47:15,125
Not as well as I thought.

692
00:47:16,716 --> 00:47:17,548
Sorry.

693
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,656
Cuervo Black.

694
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:04,726
Thanks.

695
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:12,054
Harry.

696
00:48:21,807 --> 00:48:22,985
What the hell is that?

697
00:48:23,877 --> 00:48:25,989
Cranberry juice.
Is that gonna be a problem?

698
00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:28,905
Not even close to a problem.
But the taste?

699
00:48:29,025 --> 00:48:30,160
Kind of funky.

700
00:48:37,222 --> 00:48:40,120
You know by the time my dad was my age
he already had his shield?

701
00:48:42,873 --> 00:48:44,241
Kind of why I'm here.

702
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,645
I'm taking you off
the Oscar Prado case.

703
00:48:58,339 --> 00:49:00,910
I come up with grade-A intel
on Oscar Prado

704
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,594
and I'm getting tossed off the case
for being a little loud?

705
00:49:04,377 --> 00:49:05,575
In a nutshell.

706
00:49:07,284 --> 00:49:10,504
- LaGuerta put you up to this?
- It was my decision.

707
00:49:19,779 --> 00:49:21,829
I'll tell you one thing, Angel.

708
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:27,141
I'm not letting anyone get
in the way of me getting my shield.

709
00:49:27,406 --> 00:49:30,254
There's only one person in this
department who will get in your way.

710
00:49:30,657 --> 00:49:31,458
Who?

711
00:49:32,134 --> 00:49:32,941
You.

712
00:49:44,077 --> 00:49:46,548
Can I get a real
fucking drink, please?

713
00:49:53,982 --> 00:49:57,480
<i>My sister still lives her life
trying to please our father.</i>

714
00:50:01,883 --> 00:50:02,683
<i>Me...</i>

715
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:07,740
<i>I'm following the lead
of an 8 year old kid.</i>

716
00:50:10,263 --> 00:50:11,492
<i>I'm moving on.</i>

717
00:50:20,108 --> 00:50:21,939
Thank you for last night.

718
00:50:22,782 --> 00:50:24,495
It was a nice surprise.

719
00:50:27,526 --> 00:50:29,504
This is where I wanted to be.

720
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:40,621
Again?

721
00:50:43,903 --> 00:50:45,971
All I want is chocolate pudding

722
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,789
and you.

723
00:50:49,257 --> 00:50:51,292
Not necessarily in that order.

724
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,329
Where the fuck were you last night?

725
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:11,575
- Rita's.
- It wasn't Rita's night.

726
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:13,847
- Turns out it was.
- I called you.

727
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:15,835
- I know.
- And you ignored me?

728
00:51:15,955 --> 00:51:17,338
Not you. Harry.

729
00:51:17,983 --> 00:51:18,773
Deb...

730
00:51:20,262 --> 00:51:22,346
I'm in a whole other place
when it comes to Dad.

731
00:51:22,466 --> 00:51:24,167
I'm working out some personal stuff.

732
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:25,836
You are such a fucking guy.

733
00:51:26,908 --> 00:51:29,722
What is it? She-gotta-kill-your-father-
so-you-can-become-your-own-man

734
00:51:29,842 --> 00:51:31,206
kind of bullshit?

735
00:51:32,618 --> 00:51:34,129
Dad wasn't perfect.

736
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:36,319
But he was there for you.

737
00:51:38,597 --> 00:51:39,888
- Wait.
- What?

738
00:51:41,757 --> 00:51:43,720
I'm sorry I didn't notice
your haircut.

739
00:51:47,695 --> 00:51:50,527
So what is it? Is it too short,
too young, too dorky, what?

740
00:51:51,348 --> 00:51:52,626
It's beautiful.

741
00:51:53,482 --> 00:51:54,510
Beautiful?

742
00:52:05,162 --> 00:52:06,959
You just said "beautiful".

743
00:52:08,093 --> 00:52:09,924
Yeah, I did, 'cause it is.

744
00:52:13,813 --> 00:52:16,420
It's like you honored Dad
for both of us, last night, anyway.

745
00:52:17,523 --> 00:52:18,854
I had some help.

746
00:52:22,953 --> 00:52:25,091
You're getting along
with the new boss, ma'am?

747
00:52:25,211 --> 00:52:28,567
Fuck him, he took me off
the Oscar Prado case and put me on this.

748
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,387
Some dead end Jane Doe.

749
00:52:34,455 --> 00:52:37,258
A couple of ladies of the night
called this in.

750
00:52:37,378 --> 00:52:38,583
<i>Madre de dios.</i>

751
00:52:39,052 --> 00:52:41,065
Could you turn that thing off?

752
00:52:42,187 --> 00:52:43,689
We'll work quietly.

753
00:52:45,907 --> 00:52:49,453
I'm about half way through
your article Vince. So far, very moving.

754
00:52:49,741 --> 00:52:53,156
Yeah, I was trying to make
second tier chromosome analysis sexy.

755
00:52:53,316 --> 00:52:55,299
Glad you're picking up on it.

756
00:52:55,595 --> 00:52:57,285
- Strangled.
- No blood.

757
00:52:57,405 --> 00:53:00,381
- I'm the blood guy. Why call me in?
- Because of this.

758
00:53:05,543 --> 00:53:07,637
Looks like our evil doer
had an agenda.

759
00:53:08,106 --> 00:53:11,437
- Maybe it was a tattoo or something.
- Dex, I need to know if this was ante

760
00:53:11,557 --> 00:53:12,852
or post mortem.

761
00:53:17,092 --> 00:53:18,012
<i>Teagan.</i>

762
00:53:18,515 --> 00:53:19,897
<i>Freebo's girlfriend.</i>

763
00:53:20,161 --> 00:53:22,267
<i>Looks like he's still in Miami.</i>

764
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:35,132
- You talked to Morgan yet?
- Yeah.

765
00:53:35,728 --> 00:53:37,296
How did she take it?

766
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:41,705
- There were curse words involved.
- You did good.

767
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:44,459
Sergeant.

768
00:53:59,967 --> 00:54:00,955
Way to be.

769
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,229
Thank you.

770
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,153
There you go Dexter.

771
00:54:45,473 --> 00:54:46,575
Good as new.

772
00:54:56,403 --> 00:54:58,076
Hold the elevator. Hold!

773
00:55:03,219 --> 00:55:04,164
Asshole.

774
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:06,214
Sorry.

775
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:08,191
Sergeant Asshole.

776
00:55:11,673 --> 00:55:13,304
<i>Vamos,</i> Masuka, Quinn!

777
00:55:14,152 --> 00:55:15,865
<i>Vamos</i>,
we got some celebrating to do.

778
00:55:19,311 --> 00:55:22,469
- You can still drink after last night?
- A man has his needs.

779
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:25,114
You can go back
to your cute little cranberry juice.

780
00:55:25,234 --> 00:55:27,210
It tastes like shit.
I'm gonna have a mojito.

781
00:55:27,568 --> 00:55:29,545
Or ten, on you Sarge.

782
00:55:42,656 --> 00:55:43,527
Morgan.

783
00:55:45,169 --> 00:55:47,187
You so have the wrong person.

784
00:55:47,717 --> 00:55:50,100
There's a good reason
why Quinn's of interest to IA.

785
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:54,075
No, understand me. When I say
you have the wrong person, I mean me.

786
00:55:54,917 --> 00:55:58,557
These people are more than just
badge numbers to me. They're my friends.

787
00:55:58,677 --> 00:55:59,909
They're my family.

788
00:56:01,002 --> 00:56:01,804
Listen.

789
00:56:03,386 --> 00:56:06,390
It's the sound of your shield.
Calling for help.

790
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,174
<i>Harry said that what was inside me
would be there forever.</i>

791
00:56:19,105 --> 00:56:21,633
<i>And that I wouldn't be able
to change.</i>

792
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,190
<i>He was half right.</i>

793
00:56:25,077 --> 00:56:28,010
<i>Killing Oscar Prado
is a bell I can't unring.</i>

794
00:56:28,701 --> 00:56:32,112
<i>I have moved on from my father
but I still need his code.</i>

795
00:56:32,383 --> 00:56:36,462
<i>Now more than ever.
But it has to evolve, become my own.</i>

796
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:40,147
<i>Change is good.</i>

797
00:56:40,779 --> 00:56:41,754
Hey, you.

798
00:56:42,993 --> 00:56:44,156
Hey, yourself.

799
00:56:48,908 --> 00:56:50,274
This music again.

800
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:52,462
Chocolate pudding again.

801
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:56,623
- Oh shit!
- What?

802
00:56:57,318 --> 00:56:58,904
I've done this before.

803
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:00,303
What do you mean?

804
00:57:00,463 --> 00:57:01,371
I'm pregnant.
