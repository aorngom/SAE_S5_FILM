1
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,201
Previously on "dexter"...

2
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:45,834
two treasure hunters made
a ghastly discovery today

3
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:47,467
When they stumbled
on what appears to be

4
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,867
An underwater graveyard in a
crevice off the coast of miami.

5
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:53,500
do you know
what that means?

6
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:55,934
Means there might be
a new mass murderer out there,

7
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:57,767
Way worse than
the ice-Truck killer.

8
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,533
The "bay harbor butcher"?

9
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,901
That's what the press is calling
whoever dumped bodies offshore.

10
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:04,301
The last thing miami needs
is another serial killer.

11
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:06,834
13 and counting.

12
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:08,201
They're so swamped up there,

13
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:10,034
They had to bring in
outside talent.

14
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:11,234
frank lundy?

15
00:02:11,268 --> 00:02:13,001
The green river killer,
the d. C. Sniper -

16
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:15,101
If the case was impossible,
he broke it.

17
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:18,034
so, this is the man who
stands between me and death row.

18
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:20,800
With your help, we'll find
whoever did this awful thing.

19
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:23,533
So, let's get a jump-Start
on the bay harbor butcher.

20
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:24,800
With doakes tailing me,

21
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,034
My life's been all jekyll
and no hyde.

22
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:29,400
Paul kept insisting to me

23
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:32,467
That you knocked him
over the head,

24
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,034
Dragged him to his motel,
and shot him up with drugs.

25
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,268
I hit paul to protect you
and the kids.

26
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:39,467
Look, if there is anything left
between us,

27
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,268
You will answer me
this one question

28
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:45,268
And you will tell me
the truth.

29
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:48,901
Are you an addict?

30
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:51,201
Yes, i have an addiction.

31
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,934
My name is caroline.

32
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,234
I'm an addict.

33
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:10,001
hi, caroline.

34
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:13,467
um, i started taking pain pills

35
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,001
After my back surgery.

36
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:19,533
I don't need them
for the pain anymore.

37
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,800
Now i...

38
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,533
now i just need them.

39
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:26,134
And i need duct tape -
Three or four rolls.

40
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:29,101
Running low
on heavy-Duty trash bags.

41
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:32,067
When's the last time
i sharpened my knives?

42
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:33,967
And i lost my license.

43
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,301
Tears now?

44
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:37,201
It's very hard
to concentrate in here.

45
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:39,101
How am i supposed
to get any work done?

46
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:45,268
My husband says he's gonna leave
me if i don't stay sober.

47
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:50,167
But i have to do this
for myself.

48
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:53,734
"No self-Control, lost
everything, trying to stop. "

49
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,600
Same whiny story
over and over for...

50
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:59,067
10 minutes -
Feels like 10 hours.

51
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:05,067
...taking lortabs
and darvocet and percocet

52
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:07,268
And anything
i could get my hands on.

53
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:10,800
And even now...

54
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,667
i'd kill for a vicodin.

55
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,101
Lightweight.

56
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:19,034
First i thought, "narcotics
anonymous," i don't belong here.

57
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,301
You guys are real addicts.

58
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:25,834
so, how was the meeting?
Tell me everything.

59
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,834
It was, uh, interesting,

60
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,001
Hearing the same story
over and over again.

61
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:32,034
Knowing you're not alone. Exactly.

62
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:34,700
Did you get fortune cookies?

63
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:36,433
Only the ones
with the good fortunes.

64
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:39,334
So, did you share
or just listen?

65
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:42,201
I just wanted to take it all in
my first time out.

66
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:43,800
Think they forgot...

67
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:46,101
ah, here they are.
Spring rolls.

68
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:48,600
And what about a sponsor?
Did you find one?

69
00:04:48,634 --> 00:04:51,067
I didn't want to rush
into anything.

70
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:53,067
It's an important
relationship.

71
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:55,067
Absolutely.

72
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:57,667
Okay, so, let's see
your newcomer's chip.

73
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,734
Newcomer's chip.

74
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:02,734
Yeah...

75
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:06,134
you did stay until the end,
didn't you?

76
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:09,800
Of course i did.
Right to the end.

77
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:13,734
You're a terrible liar.

78
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,800
I know too much
about 12-Step programs

79
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:22,500
To be easily conned,
dexter.

80
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:25,334
I didn't stay till the end end,
if that's what you mean.

81
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,201
I had some important errands
to run.

82
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:28,600
Mmm.
Important?

83
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:32,533
What? Am i important?
Are the kids?

84
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:34,433
Yeah.

85
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,034
Yes, of course.

86
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:38,934
Well, you're just gonna have
to figure out how important,

87
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:40,867
Because if you don't work
the program -

88
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:43,201
And i mean really work it -
I just...

89
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:44,667
i can't go through this
again.

90
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:49,134
All right, kids.
Dinner.

91
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:51,433
How important are they?

92
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:54,967
I'm sure someone with a heart
could answer that question.

93
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:05,800
Tomorrow.
I'll go tomorrow.

94
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,834
I'll stay.

95
00:06:10,634 --> 00:06:11,634
Okay.

96
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,867
Okay?
Okay.

97
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:20,034
Hold the elevator!

98
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:28,634
Thanks.

99
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,634
Nice dodge last night, flooring
it through that yellow light.

100
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:36,067
Oh...

101
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:38,067
were you behind me?

102
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:41,467
See you tonight.

103
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:47,101
we will get to all of you.

104
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:48,634
Okay, take their names

105
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,167
And keep them out of the bullpen
till we figure this out.

106
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:54,667
sue macmillan.
She disappeared four years ago.

107
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,467
Who are they?

108
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,967
every family member

109
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,534
Of every missing person
for the last decade.

110
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:01,970
Including some sad, lonely,
and presumably single women,

111
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:03,737
Courtesy
of lieutenant pascal.

112
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:06,404
It's not her fault.
That reporter's an asshole.

113
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:08,270
Sergeant?

114
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:10,337
Yeah, hold the rest of them
downstairs.

115
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,070
We're out of room here.

116
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:13,704
You seen pascal?

117
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:16,437
You know, pascal is just caught
in a cycle of reaction.

118
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:18,737
She's not co-Creating
her own reality.

119
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,571
You know those words don't
actually mean anything, right?

120
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:24,337
Look around you, bro.
She's manifesting negativity.

121
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,504
it's on again.

122
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:28,204
Excuse me, lieutenant?
No comment.

123
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:30,204
We have reports there
were dozens of bodies found

124
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:31,671
In that
underwater grave site.

125
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:32,838
Not dozens.

126
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:34,637
The boss' sweater melons
look bigger on tv.

127
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:37,437
The operative word is "boss. "
Show some respect.

128
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,771
I thought i was.

129
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:42,270
One dozen? Two dozen? 18 or so.

130
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:44,571
Have the families
been notified?

131
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:46,804
We're still trying
to identify them.

132
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:49,037
If viewers have information,
they should contact you?

133
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,904
Yes. Fine.

134
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:54,037
So, there you have it.

135
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,871
Police are seeking any leads
that can help them identify

136
00:07:56,904 --> 00:07:59,704
The 18 faceless victims
of the bay harbor butcher.

137
00:07:59,737 --> 00:08:01,471
If you have any information,
please contact...

138
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:03,471
pascal
is definitely off her game.

139
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:07,204
Word is, her fianc?Is catching
some strange on the sly.

140
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,604
That'd do it.

141
00:08:08,637 --> 00:08:10,637
The shit stops here.
Give it to me.

142
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:16,404
most of these people
won't find answers here.

143
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:17,904
Chances are good

144
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:19,938
Their loved ones
weren't among my chosen few.

145
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:23,737
may i have
your attention, please?

146
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,970
First of all,
i want to tell you

147
00:08:26,003 --> 00:08:29,604
What a great job you've all been
doing on this horrific case.

148
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:32,170
And with the help of
the best man hunter in the fbi,

149
00:08:32,204 --> 00:08:33,938
We should have answers soon.

150
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,970
In the meantime,
the daily work of this precinct

151
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:37,904
Must continue
to serve the public,

152
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:40,070
So we'll be dividing up
our resources.

153
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,604
Agent lundy has requested
the following officers

154
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:43,970
For his joint task force.

155
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,537
Officer cook...

156
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:47,504
lundy made me Lfi.

157
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:49,003
Lfi?

158
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:51,170
Lead forensics investigator.

159
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:53,771
Sorry you got boned,
but, hey, no blood spatter.

160
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:55,871
Sucks to be me.

161
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:58,304
Actually, it keeps me
off lundy's radar.

162
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,204
Sergeant lee.

163
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:02,571
Detective ramos...

164
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:06,637
...officer panko...

165
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,304
detective batista...

166
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:09,804
yes!

167
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:11,537
I saw this happening.

168
00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:13,170
...and officer debra morgan.

169
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,003
Those called will report
directly to special agent lundy.

170
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:22,103
And let's not forget
this is on all of us, folks.

171
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:24,404
Let's keep our eyes
and our ears open.

172
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:28,237
The ice-Truck killer was
an amateur compared to this guy.

173
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,003
i'd also appreciate it

174
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:33,904
If your lieutenant
would consult with me

175
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:35,370
Before speaking
to the press.

176
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:37,771
I'll rip her a new one...
if i can find her.

177
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,604
Prints, fiber,
trace evidence -

178
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:45,904
No, they won't find anything.

179
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:47,838
I followed
all of harry's

180
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:50,237
Painstaking
preventative measures.

181
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,404
He knew that nothing
stays buried forever.

182
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:54,604
His code will protect me.

183
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:57,404
Still, i wish my own sister
weren't hunting me -

184
00:09:57,437 --> 00:10:00,938
Makes for
an awkward family dynamic.

185
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,737
so, i'm a fed.
My suit proves it.

186
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,170
The other suits here are feds.

187
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:11,838
But suit or...
ugly hawaiian shirt -

188
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:14,170
No offense -

189
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:15,537
We're a team.

190
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:18,070
And our first play
is i. D.Ing those bodies.

191
00:10:18,103 --> 00:10:19,771
Once we know who they are,

192
00:10:19,804 --> 00:10:22,537
We'll fill in every detail
of their lives,

193
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:25,637
From their huevos ranchos
to their crèMe brûLéE.

194
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:28,904
And, uh,
get used to food references

195
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:32,270
'Cause, well, i like food.

196
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:34,103
Vince masuka and his team

197
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:36,404
Are gathering dna, prints,
and dental records.

198
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:39,771
The rest of us are going to cull through
cold cases and missing-Persons files.

199
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:42,637
Also, i want that crowd
out there interviewed -

200
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:45,103
Though most of them
will be a waste of time.

201
00:10:45,137 --> 00:10:46,771
Negative thinking.

202
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:49,871
You four, move them out
as quickly as you can,

203
00:10:49,904 --> 00:10:51,237
But be thorough.

204
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,070
If we get even one hit,
it'll be worth it.

205
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:56,137
Everyone else, work the files.

206
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,804
Remember,
i. D.S will lead to a pattern,

207
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:02,404
Which will lead to our man.

208
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:10,604
When the manhunt is on,
the hunted go shopping.

209
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,504
Not for a new car -

210
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:14,337
For my next project.

211
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,504
I won't act on it... yet.

212
00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:20,137
I'm still laying low.
Harry would insist on that.

213
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,103
Just getting the research
out of the way.

214
00:11:23,137 --> 00:11:26,637
Someone talked his way
into the homes of two women

215
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:28,838
And didn't leave
till they were dead.

216
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:32,704
Ann cohen and,
a month before her, lynn hall.

217
00:11:34,604 --> 00:11:37,970
A certain car dealership ran
credit checks on both women.

218
00:11:38,003 --> 00:11:39,637
Both bought cars elsewhere,

219
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:42,838
So nobody
thought about it twice.

220
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:46,003
But who requested
those credit checks?

221
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:49,571
Roger hicks.

222
00:11:52,737 --> 00:11:54,970
All i need
is some dna proof -

223
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:57,571
Cup of coffee
should do the trick.

224
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:09,771
How many kids you got?

225
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:13,137
Enough.

226
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,637
I hear you.

227
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:19,504
When my two came along,
it was bye-Bye, convertible.

228
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:22,404
Of course...
they're worth it.

229
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:24,571
Must take after their mom.

230
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:27,938
That they do.
Thank god.

231
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,771
I tell you,
i miss my convertible,

232
00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:32,737
But, uh, truth -

233
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:34,671
My minivan's
got a much nicer ride.

234
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:35,871
So you own one.

235
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:37,304
Oh, the same one
you're looking at.

236
00:12:37,337 --> 00:12:39,337
I mean, i know -
Whipped, right?

237
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,304
But, uh, my kids
love the twin dvds.

238
00:12:42,337 --> 00:12:44,504
They're just crazy about
spongebob, you know what i mean?

239
00:12:44,537 --> 00:12:45,771
Actually, i do.

240
00:12:45,804 --> 00:12:49,838
My wife loves the nav system
and all the safety features.

241
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:52,103
And when they're happy...

242
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:53,671
you're happy.
That's right.

243
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:56,237
Except the kids don't exist,
neither does the wife.

244
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,804
And he owns a beemer,
not a minivan.

245
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:01,337
Still, he's seamless.

246
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,337
Impressive.

247
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,704
It's not flashy, but...

248
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:05,771
what did flash ever get me?

249
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:07,037
It got me pulled over,
that's what.

250
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,970
I'm definitely
not into flash.

251
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:11,704
You got to sit
in the captain's chair, though.

252
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:13,270
It's like a 747, man.

253
00:13:13,304 --> 00:13:14,804
Manuel, hold up.

254
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,904
Thank you, sir.

255
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:19,571
So, uh...

256
00:13:19,604 --> 00:13:22,204
we should take it out.
Check out the ride.

257
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:23,404
I'm just doing research.

258
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:25,404
Okay, you don't want
a big sales pitch.

259
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,471
I get that.

260
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:29,437
Let me at least
pull the specs for you.

261
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,137
Because, truthfully,

262
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,370
We have a hard time
keeping these on the lot.

263
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:34,871
You might want to grab
the test-Drive

264
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:36,070
While it's still here.

265
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:38,337
I think i have
all the information i need

266
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,404
To make a decision.

267
00:13:39,437 --> 00:13:40,437
Yeah?

268
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:41,871
Well, then,
you've seen the, uh,

269
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,471
The stow 'n go
seating system, right?

270
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:48,938
I have had
everything in here

271
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,270
From a soccer team
to a freakin' deer carcass.

272
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:54,938
It was an accident,
of course.

273
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,671
But, uh, i sure was glad
for the ample cargo space,

274
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,170
Not to mention
the tinted windows.

275
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,437
I can see
how that might come in handy.

276
00:14:04,471 --> 00:14:07,270
I'll just grab the keys.

277
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,838
I go to stalk a killer
and i end up with a new car?

278
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:25,838
How'd that happen?

279
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:27,871
New car?

280
00:14:27,904 --> 00:14:30,037
Yeah.

281
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,404
You get married?

282
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,103
Not that i know of.

283
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:36,337
Huh.

284
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,571
So what's with
the mommy mobile?

285
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:41,204
I'm, uh...

286
00:14:41,237 --> 00:14:43,938
not sure.

287
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:56,871
Synthetic.

288
00:14:56,904 --> 00:14:59,003
Even roger's hair is a lie.

289
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:01,270
I could learn a thing or two
from this guy.

290
00:15:02,537 --> 00:15:04,637
Who's your daddy?

291
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,237
Uh... harry morgan.

292
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,904
Dude, the lead
forensics investigator

293
00:15:09,938 --> 00:15:12,571
Of the joint task force -
That's who.

294
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:14,838
Oh, okay.

295
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:17,070
So, you want in
on this bitch or not?

296
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:18,370
What bitch?

297
00:15:18,404 --> 00:15:21,070
The only bitch in town, baby.
The bay harbor butcher.

298
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:24,003
I got you
temporarily assigned.

299
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:25,637
Vince, you didn't
have to do that.

300
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:26,904
Nothing sexy, of course,

301
00:15:26,938 --> 00:15:28,871
Just some bone-Marrow
collection for dna i. D.S.

302
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:30,337
But it'll get you
in the tent.

303
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,737
And you got to see
the tent.

304
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:32,605
Amazing.

305
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:37,171
Say it.

306
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:39,605
You're my daddy.

307
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,438
It sounds weird
when you say it.

308
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:45,405
I haven't been much use
since he disappeared.

309
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:49,205
I know i'm supposed to
move on,

310
00:15:49,238 --> 00:15:50,704
But...

311
00:15:50,737 --> 00:15:54,038
here's the picture of him.

312
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:55,904
He looks...

313
00:15:57,338 --> 00:15:58,405
...nice.

314
00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:04,104
Not according to my mother...
or the police.

315
00:16:04,138 --> 00:16:06,538
He was in and out of jail,

316
00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:10,771
But my heart raced
whenever i saw him.

317
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,605
I brought his toothbrush.

318
00:16:14,638 --> 00:16:16,605
They say
you can get dna off it.

319
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:21,071
You can find him
with this, right?

320
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:33,405
Special agent lundy?

321
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:36,938
Look, thanks for choosing me
for the task force and all,

322
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:39,837
But i'd appreciate
you finding someone else.

323
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:41,104
You want off?

324
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:44,138
Just as soon as
you can replace me, sir.

325
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,837
This is a chance to solve
a pretty important case.

326
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:49,704
Most people get into this
line of work to do just that.

327
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:54,171
Well, i've got
cases of my own backing up,

328
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,938
And the precinct's shorthanded
with all this shit.

329
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:59,271
So, if you don't mind...

330
00:17:00,338 --> 00:17:01,971
i'll see what i can do.

331
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:05,837
In the meantime, if you could
continue the interviews...

332
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:08,371
yeah.
Yeah, of course.

333
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:10,205
Thank you.

334
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:19,205
Most of 'em have
been underwater for years.

335
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,904
But some, it's awesome,
you can't even tell.

336
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:23,405
The temperature
on the ocean floor

337
00:17:23,438 --> 00:17:25,505
And the airtight bags
kept them intact.

338
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:28,038
I mean, a little gelatinous
residue, sure. But...

339
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:30,438
i'd rather remember my
old playmates as they were -

340
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:32,305
Neat, clean little packages.

341
00:17:32,338 --> 00:17:34,572
You know, vince, i appreciate
you doing me this favor but -

342
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:36,572
Actually, you're
doing me the favor.

343
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:37,572
I need your help, buddy.

344
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:40,004
The pressure's
fucking ridonkulous.

345
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:42,505
Glad to be of service.

346
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:44,804
Field morgue
for the overflow,

347
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:46,071
But it's
state-Of-The-Art.

348
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:48,438
Fucking fbi, eh?

349
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:57,871
A good percentage
are just bones.

350
00:17:57,904 --> 00:17:59,538
Must have fed the fish
when the bags tore.

351
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:01,538
Humpty fucking dumpty,
right?

352
00:18:01,572 --> 00:18:03,405
Exactly.

353
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:06,305
They weren't
meant to be put together again.

354
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:08,704
They were meant to remain
in the silent shadows,

355
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:12,038
Keeping their secrets.

356
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:14,171
Now they're
exposed to the glare,

357
00:18:14,205 --> 00:18:19,572
Reflecting my darkness like
some grotesque carnival mirror.

358
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:23,405
Harry was right -
Nothing stays buried.

359
00:18:23,438 --> 00:18:25,771
Perhaps not even me.

360
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:35,672
Looking for my taurus,
sergeant?

361
00:18:35,704 --> 00:18:37,538
Keep looking.

362
00:18:37,572 --> 00:18:40,238
You don't need to know
where i'm going tonight.

363
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:42,737
And genius me,

364
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:45,737
Not only do i leave
my works in my girlfriend's car,

365
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:49,205
But also all the dead fish
from the fishing trip, right?

366
00:18:50,538 --> 00:18:53,871
Then i collapse
in her parents' house,

367
00:18:53,904 --> 00:18:55,871
Scare her kids,

368
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:58,071
And get myself fired,
'cause guess what -

369
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,071
We work together.

370
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,704
aw.

371
00:19:00,737 --> 00:19:01,871
Yeah.

372
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:06,538
So, now, well,

373
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:08,438
I'm 20-Days sober...

374
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:11,205
again...

375
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:13,538
hoping to make it to 21.

376
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:20,505
Thanks, gordon.

377
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:25,904
This meeting recognizes
lengths of sobriety with chips.

378
00:19:25,938 --> 00:19:31,238
So, if there's anyone who
would like a newcomer's chip...

379
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:43,371
you've got three minutes
to share if you want it.

380
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:45,837
Oh, really?

381
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:47,638
Go ahead, man.
You among friends.

382
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:59,038
Well, i, uh...

383
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:03,638
what's your name?

384
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:08,305
Bob.

385
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:09,771
hi, bob.

386
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:11,205
Hi.

387
00:20:11,238 --> 00:20:15,238
And i'm, um...

388
00:20:15,271 --> 00:20:16,305
an addict.

389
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:20,837
I use... heroin -

390
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:22,837
Shoot it.

391
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:24,305
It's affecting my job.

392
00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:27,305
My boss found my works.
He fired my ass.

393
00:20:27,338 --> 00:20:28,605
But i showed him -

394
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:31,138
I spent every penny
of my final paycheck on junk.

395
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:35,271
Doctor said i...

396
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,271
...uh...

397
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:46,638
...i almost died.

398
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:56,071
Coffee sucks...

399
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:58,238
as bad
as the doughnuts.

400
00:20:58,271 --> 00:20:59,804
It's better next door.

401
00:20:59,837 --> 00:21:00,672
Come on.

402
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:10,238
Mmm.

403
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,737
It is good coffee.
Thank you.

404
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:17,205
So, tell me...

405
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:22,238
exactly how full of shit
are you?

406
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:28,004
I'm not full of anything.

407
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:30,971
It was a nice performance
in there.

408
00:21:31,004 --> 00:21:34,305
Where did you download it from?
Addict. Com?

409
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:39,471
Look,
i have no reason to lie.

410
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:41,138
Sure you do.

411
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:43,405
We all do.

412
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:45,338
You thought i was lying?

413
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:48,071
I don't know...
bob.

414
00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:51,771
Well, it is anonymous.

415
00:21:51,804 --> 00:21:53,672
Everyone in that room

416
00:21:53,704 --> 00:21:57,971
Has heard or lived far worse
than anything you've ever done.

417
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:00,971
I doubt it.

418
00:22:01,004 --> 00:22:04,305
Oh, so you're
super-Junkie.

419
00:22:04,338 --> 00:22:06,638
I don't mean to imply

420
00:22:06,672 --> 00:22:09,038
That what you've been through
hasn't been difficult.

421
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:10,672
But there's no way

422
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,704
That i could know what
you've experienced, right?

423
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:21,405
I couldn't
possibly feel that need.

424
00:22:23,538 --> 00:22:28,871
Like a thousand hiding voices
whispering,

425
00:22:28,904 --> 00:22:31,338
"This is who you are. "

426
00:22:34,205 --> 00:22:36,837
And you fight the pressure,

427
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:41,238
The growing need
rising like a wave,

428
00:22:41,271 --> 00:22:47,871
Prickling and teasing
and prodding to be fed.

429
00:22:47,904 --> 00:22:50,804
But the whispering
gets louder

430
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,505
Until it's screaming, "now!"

431
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:59,405
And it's the only voice
you hear...

432
00:23:01,471 --> 00:23:04,638
the only voice
you want to hear.

433
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:09,771
And you belong to it,

434
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:12,704
To this...

435
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:15,804
shadow self.

436
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:18,871
To this...

437
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:25,205
dark passenger.

438
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,138
Yes.

439
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:31,971
The dark passenger.

440
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:38,837
No.

441
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,605
I'm sorry,
but i need to go.

442
00:23:46,904 --> 00:23:49,071
Thanks for the coffee.

443
00:23:54,871 --> 00:23:56,538
She knows.

444
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:01,405
She recognizes demons...

445
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:03,771
dark passengers.

446
00:24:03,804 --> 00:24:05,704
Maybe the others can, too.

447
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:08,971
This program is too risky,
especially now.

448
00:24:09,004 --> 00:24:11,371
Rita will have to understand.

449
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:34,505
Hey.
You just missed story time.

450
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:36,737
I was at a meeting.

451
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:41,471
Thank you.

452
00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:46,205
It made me realize
something important.

453
00:24:46,238 --> 00:24:48,305
Oh, really?
What's that?

454
00:24:48,338 --> 00:24:51,672
Those meetings are
not a good place for me.

455
00:24:54,305 --> 00:24:57,871
I know how this sounds,
but i can do this on my own.

456
00:24:57,904 --> 00:24:59,638
Dexter, you need a program.

457
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:01,804
I've read studies -
People are 10 times as likely

458
00:25:01,837 --> 00:25:03,071
To change on their own

459
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:05,205
As they are with the help
of doctors or programs.

460
00:25:05,238 --> 00:25:07,505
So you're quoting studies?

461
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,438
Look, i lived this.

462
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:12,605
I watched paul try and fail
with white-Knuckle sobriety.

463
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:15,572
I'm not paul.
I'm not any of those people.

464
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:18,004
Going to those meetings
will do more harm than good,

465
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:19,171
I swear to you.

466
00:25:19,205 --> 00:25:20,605
I'm better off alone.

467
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:30,405
I pray you change your mind.

468
00:25:35,938 --> 00:25:38,704
What just happened?

469
00:25:44,871 --> 00:25:48,672
Deb?

470
00:25:58,271 --> 00:26:00,804
Thought you were staying
at rita's.

471
00:26:00,837 --> 00:26:03,038
Uh...

472
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:05,338
taking the night off.

473
00:26:08,438 --> 00:26:12,138
I thought you'd be
on the treadmill.

474
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,904
Taking the night off.

475
00:26:13,938 --> 00:26:16,538
With no money down, guaranteed,

476
00:26:16,572 --> 00:26:18,771
Or we'll make
your first two payments...

477
00:26:18,804 --> 00:26:23,438
a night off is good
to remember what's important.

478
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:35,771
Two women are dead,

479
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,538
The killer is selling minivans,

480
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:39,371
And i have an opportunity
to prove it,

481
00:26:39,405 --> 00:26:41,238
Even if i am laying low.

482
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:43,305
Having a victim
prepped and ready

483
00:26:43,338 --> 00:26:44,904
Will take the edge
off the wait...

484
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:45,971
i hope.

485
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,938
Hey, hang on
just a second, okay?

486
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:50,171
What's going on, dex? Hey.

487
00:26:50,205 --> 00:26:52,771
Any problems, the service center
can take care of you,

488
00:26:52,804 --> 00:26:54,638
But they're
around the corner.

489
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:56,505
Actually,
the minivan's fine.

490
00:26:56,538 --> 00:26:58,704
Well, of course it is.
I never sold a lemon in my life.

491
00:26:58,737 --> 00:27:00,471
I'm just rethinking
the extended warranty.

492
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:02,572
Great, i'll set you up
with a warranty writer, then.

493
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:04,672
And i'm thinking roof rack
and premium sound system.

494
00:27:04,704 --> 00:27:06,305
Going all out.
Yeah.

495
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:07,971
That's great,
but i'm with a customer.

496
00:27:08,004 --> 00:27:09,638
And so
one of my associates -

497
00:27:09,672 --> 00:27:10,971
I'd rather deal with you.

498
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,771
I'll just wait for you
in your office.

499
00:27:12,804 --> 00:27:14,338
Outstanding.

500
00:27:24,004 --> 00:27:27,505
Dna, dna, come out and play.

501
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:34,171
Uh-Oh, roger's got you
in the box.

502
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:37,171
Once you're in the box, you
don't leave without a deal.

503
00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:38,837
Uh-Oh.

504
00:27:38,871 --> 00:27:40,704
Don't worry.
You're safe with roger.

505
00:27:40,737 --> 00:27:41,804
He's the best.

506
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:44,804
I'm just dropping off
this thank-You note.

507
00:27:44,837 --> 00:27:46,971
Well, i was just leaving.

508
00:27:47,004 --> 00:27:49,804
He sent you across the street,
didn't he?

509
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:51,305
Across the street?

510
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,305
It's okay, he told me
not to tell anyone either.

511
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,004
Yeah, i don't know
how he makes a living

512
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:57,871
Sending all of his commissions
to other dealers.

513
00:27:57,904 --> 00:27:59,605
Maybe he has
ulterior motives.

514
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:02,471
Or maybe he knows
i can't afford his price.

515
00:28:02,505 --> 00:28:04,538
After he ran a credit check?

516
00:28:04,572 --> 00:28:06,538
Trw doesn't lie.

517
00:28:06,572 --> 00:28:08,205
So, you're single?

518
00:28:10,104 --> 00:28:11,338
Y- Yeah.

519
00:28:11,371 --> 00:28:12,672
Makes it tougher to afford

520
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:15,138
Those big-Ticket items,
like cars and houses.

521
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:16,638
You rent an apartment?

522
00:28:16,672 --> 00:28:19,371
A house. I hate sharing walls.
You can hear everything.

523
00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:21,837
Tell me about it.
No pets, though, right?

524
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:23,438
Yeah.

525
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:26,471
Is this a come-On?
'Cause it's a little weird.

526
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:29,471
It must be
why i'm still single.

527
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:31,305
Another brunette.

528
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:37,904
Single, neighbors
at a distance, no guard dog.

529
00:28:37,938 --> 00:28:42,338
The credit check gets roger
all the details he needs.

530
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:47,104
She's next, and i can't do
anything about it -

531
00:28:47,138 --> 00:28:49,538
Not until this manhunt ends.

532
00:28:49,572 --> 00:28:51,471
Harry would insist on it.

533
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:02,405
What?
No, i'll take care of it.

534
00:29:02,438 --> 00:29:04,171
I know the card is in his name.

535
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:07,138
I just want to check
the charges.

536
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:10,405
Well, the supervisor i spoke
with this morning allowed it.

537
00:29:10,438 --> 00:29:13,771
Yes - No, uh...
yeah, i'll hold.

538
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:15,672
Yes?

539
00:29:15,704 --> 00:29:17,938
Just a reminder

540
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:20,471
That the biscayne drive-By
warrant needs your approval.

541
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:21,938
I'll look at it.

542
00:29:21,971 --> 00:29:23,771
And the homicide
that came in last night

543
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,704
Still needs to be assigned.

544
00:29:25,737 --> 00:29:26,804
Right, thanks.

545
00:29:30,004 --> 00:29:33,238
Look, esmee,
i know that things are rough

546
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,205
With you and your fianc?Right
now, and i'm sorry, really,

547
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:38,371
But we need to keep clearing
that board out there.

548
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:40,938
Yeah, you're right.
I'm sorry.

549
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:44,638
I seem to have had my head
up my ass lately.

550
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:47,271
It's called "being human. "

551
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,405
Okay, who's up?

552
00:29:50,438 --> 00:29:51,904
Samuels and kent are up.

553
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:54,071
Put them
on the liquor-Store shooting.

554
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:56,704
And where
is the biscayne warrant?

555
00:29:56,737 --> 00:29:59,471
Oh, right here.

556
00:29:59,505 --> 00:30:01,771
Simms and hoagie
want s. W.A.T. For entry.

557
00:30:01,804 --> 00:30:04,438
I think it's a good measure,
given the weapons charge.

558
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:07,004
Excuse me, i'm -
I'm gonna need a minute.

559
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,004
Just...

560
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:10,338
uh...

561
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:11,672
just gonna need a minute.

562
00:30:11,704 --> 00:30:12,771
Esmee?

563
00:30:12,804 --> 00:30:14,205
Oh.

564
00:30:14,238 --> 00:30:15,305
Esmee?

565
00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:16,771
Please, maria.

566
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:21,004
I'll handle it.

567
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:29,471
You're not taking my calls,

568
00:30:29,505 --> 00:30:32,971
And now you're checking
my credit-Card charges, esmee?

569
00:30:35,638 --> 00:30:39,371
Roger's dna matches the semen
found at both crime scenes.

570
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:41,438
Irrefutable.

571
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:46,471
If i do nothing,
another woman dies.

572
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:50,205
Is that my long-Dormant
conscience talking

573
00:30:50,238 --> 00:30:53,471
Or the dark passenger
whispering?

574
00:31:01,171 --> 00:31:03,904
Hi, it's me.

575
00:31:03,938 --> 00:31:05,737
Hi, dexter.

576
00:31:05,771 --> 00:31:08,471
Kids home from school yet?

577
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:11,004
Colleen's
bringing them home now.

578
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,371
I'm a... little confused.

579
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:18,605
I'm sorry you're confused.

580
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:22,038
I mean, it's pizza night.
Should i pick up the usual?

581
00:31:22,071 --> 00:31:23,904
Did you go back?

582
00:31:23,938 --> 00:31:26,704
To a meeting -
Thinking about it.

583
00:31:26,737 --> 00:31:29,271
The kids and i
will order in, then.

584
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,638
Uh, okay.

585
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:35,904
So...

586
00:31:37,971 --> 00:31:39,837
...is this it?

587
00:31:39,871 --> 00:31:43,171
That's up to you, dexter.

588
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,371
I want to know,

589
00:31:49,405 --> 00:31:51,704
Where is she,
mi teresita.

590
00:31:51,737 --> 00:31:54,871
She's so young -
7 year old.

591
00:31:54,904 --> 00:31:58,737
You help me.
I know you find her.

592
00:31:58,771 --> 00:31:59,904
We'll do what we can.

593
00:31:59,938 --> 00:32:00,904
Por favor!

594
00:32:00,938 --> 00:32:02,871
Don't cry.

595
00:32:02,904 --> 00:32:05,605
Pero yo rec?
Y dios me mand?A ti.

596
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:07,904
No spanish. No habla.
T?La encontraráS.

597
00:32:07,938 --> 00:32:10,038
Only english.
Angel?

598
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:14,138
Just tell her
we'll call her.

599
00:32:14,171 --> 00:32:17,071
Me encontrar?/I>
a mi teresita, ¿Verdad?

600
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:20,271
Necesito saber dóNde est?/I>
y lo que le ha pasado.

601
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,238
She thinks you can find
the daughter.

602
00:32:23,737 --> 00:32:26,138
There are no kids
down there.

603
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:27,971
Tell her i can't help her.

604
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:29,104
She -

605
00:32:29,138 --> 00:32:30,704
I- I can't help you.

606
00:32:30,737 --> 00:32:33,871
Por favor!

607
00:32:33,904 --> 00:32:36,971
Morgan?
Morgan!

608
00:32:45,238 --> 00:32:48,704
It's been 24 hours
since i asked to be replaced.

609
00:32:48,737 --> 00:32:49,904
Has it?

610
00:32:49,938 --> 00:32:51,737
What's taking so long?

611
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:54,572
Every cop on the damn force
wants in on this case.

612
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,338
Just take your pick.

613
00:32:57,371 --> 00:33:00,271
I've been wondering
about that, actually.

614
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:04,538
Everyone wants on,
but you want off.

615
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:07,704
I told you, i have cases.

616
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:09,271
I don't think so.

617
00:33:09,305 --> 00:33:11,605
You don't think so.

618
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:15,538
Jesus, i just don't want to be
on your task force, all right?

619
00:33:15,572 --> 00:33:16,904
Why?

620
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:19,938
Because i'm the last person in
the world that should be on it.

621
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:22,672
You want me
to find a serial killer?

622
00:33:22,704 --> 00:33:24,871
I was engaged to one,
for christ's sake.

623
00:33:24,904 --> 00:33:28,338
What kind of cop -
What kind of -

624
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:30,138
That's why i chose you,
you know -

625
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:32,837
Because of what
you went through.

626
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:35,271
You survived.

627
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,271
I don't know how.

628
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:39,804
I can't begin to imagine
the strength it took -

629
00:33:39,837 --> 00:33:42,138
Continues to take.

630
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:45,737
More than that,
you got a firsthand look

631
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:48,371
Into the mind and heart
of a killer,

632
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:51,904
And you're still here.

633
00:33:51,938 --> 00:33:56,305
If you can accept that -
Really accept it -

634
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:59,338
You could use it.

635
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:02,405
Mix that with some
of your strength, and...

636
00:34:02,438 --> 00:34:04,238
you could catch someone
even worse

637
00:34:04,271 --> 00:34:05,638
Than the ice-Truck killer.

638
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,737
But you have to stop running.

639
00:34:15,572 --> 00:34:19,104
Finish today's interviews.

640
00:34:19,138 --> 00:34:22,837
Then, if you still want out,
you got it.

641
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:31,438
Lead fucking investigator.

642
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:33,438
Translation -
Everyone's bitch.

643
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,538
I do have a life, you know.

644
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:37,305
You do?

645
00:34:37,338 --> 00:34:40,771
Just give me
your bone-Marrow dna results.

646
00:34:40,804 --> 00:34:42,405
No matches.

647
00:34:42,438 --> 00:34:44,305
Big surprise.

648
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:46,238
Do me a favor on your way out,
will you?

649
00:34:46,271 --> 00:34:48,638
Drop these dental x-Rays
at the field morgue for me?

650
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:49,904
Tech should still be there.

651
00:34:49,938 --> 00:34:51,505
Fucking bay harbor butcher

652
00:34:51,538 --> 00:34:53,638
Is butchering
my online social life.

653
00:34:56,238 --> 00:34:57,672
Sorry.

654
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:04,205
Next.

655
00:35:10,771 --> 00:35:13,672
i figured you'd still be here.

656
00:35:13,704 --> 00:35:17,205
You were a pain in the ass
but always a damn hard worker.

657
00:35:17,238 --> 00:35:20,238
And, of course, you knew
how to handle the press.

658
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,038
Come here a minute.

659
00:35:35,238 --> 00:35:37,672
The public needs to believe
that we can protect them,

660
00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:39,971
Or all hell breaks loose,
so i need all my people

661
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:41,871
Operating at their
very highest levels.

662
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:43,605
I agree.

663
00:35:43,638 --> 00:35:45,371
Should i be worried
about pascal?

664
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:48,538
Pascal?

665
00:35:48,572 --> 00:35:49,605
Why?

666
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:53,071
You can cut the crap, maria.

667
00:35:53,104 --> 00:35:55,605
I know she's been awol
on personal matters.

668
00:35:55,638 --> 00:35:57,505
The press fuckup is huge,

669
00:35:57,538 --> 00:36:00,804
And now i'm beginning to hear
rumors about erratic behavior.

670
00:36:00,837 --> 00:36:03,104
And you're asking me
because...

671
00:36:03,138 --> 00:36:04,672
because you've done the job.

672
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,004
So if she's out,
that means you're back in.

673
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:11,271
That makes you her harshest
critic, and i want it straight.

674
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:12,338
So...

675
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:14,672
take your shot, maria.

676
00:36:14,704 --> 00:36:16,471
Hmm.

677
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:18,305
You know what
"erratic" means?

678
00:36:19,438 --> 00:36:22,438
It's code for "non-Male,"

679
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,205
And it's the same bullshit
sexism i put up with

680
00:36:25,238 --> 00:36:27,471
When i was in charge.

681
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:31,071
I won't dignify rumors, captain.
Pascal's fine.

682
00:36:39,337 --> 00:36:41,805
Minivan's that way.

683
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:44,805
Field morgue's this way.

684
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:46,437
I'll wait.

685
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:48,905
You should take the night off,
sergeant.

686
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:50,304
On pizza night?

687
00:36:50,337 --> 00:36:52,871
No way.

688
00:36:52,905 --> 00:36:54,704
What does that girlfriend
of yours see

689
00:36:54,738 --> 00:36:56,000
In a freak show like you
anyway?

690
00:36:56,035 --> 00:36:57,167
You have to ask her.

691
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,567
Maybe i will.

692
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:06,500
What exactly is it
you think i've done?

693
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:08,901
I know you're connected
to the ice-Truck killer.

694
00:37:08,933 --> 00:37:11,233
Could you be more vague?

695
00:37:11,267 --> 00:37:13,200
I know you're too careful.

696
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,700
You keep
your assets in cash.

697
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:17,267
You don't belong to any
organizations or alumni groups.

698
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,066
You were top of your class
in med school,

699
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,933
But you traded it
for fucking blood spatter.

700
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:24,233
I know you studied martial arts
in college,

701
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:27,834
But i don't know what a lab geek
needs with advanced jujitsu.

702
00:37:27,867 --> 00:37:30,500
Do you know
what an easy credit is?

703
00:37:30,534 --> 00:37:33,400
I know
you're a good liar, too.

704
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,233
Not good enough.

705
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,200
sergeant doakes
thinks he knows my secrets,

706
00:37:58,233 --> 00:38:02,333
But he only needs to look
at this, my body of work,

707
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,000
To know the real me.

708
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:06,434
Suit up
if you're gonna touch them.

709
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,667
Oh.

710
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:14,033
No, i'm just, uh...
dropping off some x-Rays.

711
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:15,734
I'm dexter morgan.

712
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:17,700
I know who you are.

713
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:20,667
Right.

714
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,267
Looks like the lab tech's
gone home for the night,

715
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,700
So i'll just...

716
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:33,300
you hoping
they'll talk to you?

717
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,066
The ones with heads,
anyway.

718
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:40,834
They always speak...
eventually.

719
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:47,667
Just got to ask
the right question.

720
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,367
Which is?

721
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:53,567
"Why were they chosen?"

722
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,801
You looking for a pattern?

723
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,700
One doesn't kill
this many people

724
00:38:58,734 --> 00:39:02,367
In this careful, methodical way
without a reason -

725
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,434
Some...

726
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,367
twisted set of principles.

727
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:11,467
Yeah, they would have to be
twisted, wouldn't they?

728
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,834
The worst killers in history
are usually the ones

729
00:39:13,867 --> 00:39:16,100
Who think their murders
were somehow... just -

730
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:18,600
Even deserved.

731
00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:20,534
Leaders have slaughtered
whole populations

732
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,901
For the same warped reason.

733
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:26,767
But there's never
any justification for killing.

734
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:28,933
No.

735
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,467
Well, one, of course.

736
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,267
To save an innocent life.

737
00:39:37,966 --> 00:39:40,634
To save an innocent life.

738
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,634
How many more bodies
would there be

739
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:46,834
Had i not stopped
those killers?

740
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:49,066
I didn't do it to save lives...

741
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,634
but save lives i did.

742
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:54,467
Motivation aside,

743
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:59,200
I think harry and lundy
would agree on this one.

744
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,300
roger the artful dodger.

745
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:10,500
Jesus!

746
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,300
You scared me, bro.

747
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:14,567
We have
some unfinished business.

748
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,467
Oh, yeah, right,
the warranty and stuff.

749
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
Listen, uh...
i can't write you up right now.

750
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:19,966
I got the wife
waiting for me.

751
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,467
You're not married.

752
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,634
Ex-Wife.
I got to take the kids.

753
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:24,834
You don't have kids.
Stepkids - They're hers.

754
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:25,534
Nope.

755
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:27,434
Okay, how about this one?

756
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,600
I don't give a shit.

757
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,400
Neither do i.

758
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:46,567
You were right
about the ample cargo space.

759
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:05,133
Where am i?

760
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,066
Looks different
under plastic,

761
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,033
But you spent
an evening here...

762
00:41:15,066 --> 00:41:17,734
with ann cohen.

763
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,500
You took her last breath
from her right over there.

764
00:41:20,534 --> 00:41:22,000
You remember?
No.

765
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:24,233
You're - You're wrong.
I wouldn't.

766
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:27,066
You would and you did and
you were about to do it again.

767
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,167
That's why we're here.

768
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,534
No, this is crazy.

769
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:32,834
You got the wrong guy.
I -

770
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:34,400
I sell cars, for god's sake.

771
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:37,700
I've never hurt anyone in my
life - Definitely not a woman.

772
00:41:37,734 --> 00:41:39,167
Why can't i do that?

773
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,267
Do what?

774
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,834
Lie like that.

775
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:46,534
I mean, i thought i was good,
but you, it's... mwah.

776
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:47,933
I don't lie.

777
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:50,267
Okay, that one was weak.

778
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,933
Okay, look, any car on the lot,
it's yours.

779
00:41:53,966 --> 00:41:57,400
T- Bird, town car, you name it -
Yours free.

780
00:41:57,434 --> 00:41:58,467
I'll call it in right now.

781
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,567
Lot's closed.

782
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,767
I'll have them open it up.
I'm the manager.

783
00:42:01,801 --> 00:42:03,467
The manager's name
is rick buxton.

784
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,100
Yeah, but i've been there
longer than he has.

785
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:07,400
You've been there three months. At the other lot.

786
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,367
It's like watching someone
ski moguls.

787
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,534
You just hop
from one lie to the next -

788
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:16,966
No shame, no embarrassment.

789
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,333
You just don't give a shit.

790
00:42:22,033 --> 00:42:23,400
That's the key, right?

791
00:42:23,434 --> 00:42:27,066
Not to care
about anyone or anything.

792
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,033
I care.

793
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:31,200
I care a lot.

794
00:42:31,233 --> 00:42:33,434
No, it was a compliment.

795
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,634
I don't care, either.

796
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:36,367
Yes, you do.

797
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,801
Like about your wife.

798
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:39,167
Not married.

799
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,534
Girlfriend, then.

800
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:43,567
I saw it the minute
you walked on the lot.

801
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,133
What did you see?
Tell me.

802
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:54,100
Look, most guys your age,
they beeline...

803
00:42:54,133 --> 00:42:55,600
right for the horsepower -

804
00:42:55,634 --> 00:42:57,534
You know,
something flashy, sexy.

805
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:59,000
But you -

806
00:42:59,033 --> 00:43:02,434
You're there all alone,
no one there to nag you,

807
00:43:02,467 --> 00:43:05,033
And you don't even glance
at the coupes.

808
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:08,233
The only thing you look at
is the minivan,

809
00:43:08,267 --> 00:43:12,066
Like you can see her
in the passenger's seat

810
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,467
And the kids in the back.

811
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,567
Leave the kids out.
See?

812
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,534
You're lying to yourself
if you think you don't care.

813
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,100
She's just a companion,
really.

814
00:43:25,133 --> 00:43:26,834
Started that way,
anyway.

815
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,333
Someone who...

816
00:43:31,367 --> 00:43:33,233
looked good, normal.

817
00:43:33,267 --> 00:43:35,000
They worm their way in.

818
00:43:35,033 --> 00:43:37,167
Yeah, they do.

819
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,700
Then they shut you out.

820
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:47,534
That's what this is about -
That she shut you out?

821
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:50,233
Oh.
Man, okay, i get it.

822
00:43:50,267 --> 00:43:52,933
I- I - I've been there.

823
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:56,534
But you can't let her
get to you like this,

824
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,233
'Cause - 'Cause
they're all the same -

825
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:01,567
Fucking bitches.

826
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,233
You do everything for them,
and then they fuck you.

827
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:05,700
She's not worth it,
all right?

828
00:44:05,734 --> 00:44:07,400
You're better off
without that cunt.

829
00:44:07,434 --> 00:44:08,834
Don't...

830
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:13,066
...talk that way
about my girlfriend.

831
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:23,267
i'm dexter,
and i'm not sure what i am.

832
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,534
hi, dexter.

833
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:31,400
I just know
there's something dark in me...

834
00:44:31,434 --> 00:44:33,600
and i hide it.

835
00:44:35,801 --> 00:44:38,600
I certainly
don't talk about it...

836
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,434
but it's there...

837
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:42,767
always.

838
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,333
This dark passenger.

839
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:52,100
And when he's driving,
i feel...

840
00:44:52,133 --> 00:44:55,100
alive...

841
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:59,400
half sick with the thrill
of complete wrongness.

842
00:45:01,834 --> 00:45:03,600
I don't fight him.

843
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,167
I don't want to.

844
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:11,167
He's all i've got.

845
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,966
Nothing else could love me,

846
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,333
Not even...

847
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:18,901
...especially not me.

848
00:45:22,467 --> 00:45:27,100
Or is that just a lie
the dark passenger tells me?

849
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:34,734
Because lately there are
these moments when i feel...

850
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,600
...connected
to something else - Someone.

851
00:45:47,734 --> 00:45:50,966
It's like...

852
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
the mask is slipping...

853
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:58,801
...and things...

854
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,367
...people...

855
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,634
who never mattered before
are suddenly starting to matter.

856
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,534
It scares the hell out of me.

857
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,200
Hello...

858
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,534
dexter.

859
00:46:52,867 --> 00:46:56,600
that's all the time
we have for sharing.

860
00:46:56,634 --> 00:47:01,000
Would someone lead us
in the serenity prayer?

861
00:47:01,033 --> 00:47:02,966
Lila.

862
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:19,100
I knew there
was something wrong with you.

863
00:47:19,133 --> 00:47:23,200
The secrets,
the sneaking around -

864
00:47:23,233 --> 00:47:25,066
Now it all makes sense.

865
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,901
god grant me
serenity to accept...

866
00:47:27,933 --> 00:47:31,300
a lot of cops
have been where you are.

867
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,667
The booze, the drugs...

868
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,066
makes the job go down easier.

869
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:42,200
Stay clean and stay out of
my way, we won't have a problem.

870
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:47,066
Oh, and you owe me a new
michelin, you motherfucker.

871
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,233
I have all your forms,

872
00:47:58,267 --> 00:48:00,634
So we'll do what we can
to bring your dad home.

873
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:02,801
I'm sorry.
You don't understand.

874
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:04,933
I don't want him home.

875
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:07,500
Just tell me he's dead.
We need to know he's gone.

876
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:10,267
Right, you want closure.

877
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,167
I want peace.

878
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,966
He made our lives
a living hell.

879
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,667
When he'd go to prison,
it was a blessing, but, uh...

880
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,634
you kept letting him out.

881
00:48:19,667 --> 00:48:22,233
I need to tell
my mother, my sister

882
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,834
That they're safe
and that he's rotting in hell.

883
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:27,333
Call me
when you can tell me that.

884
00:48:42,033 --> 00:48:44,434
Lundy, wait.

885
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:46,834
Uh...

886
00:48:46,867 --> 00:48:50,066
i think - I mean,
it could be a coincidence -

887
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,333
But there are two of them.

888
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:53,267
Two...

889
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,167
missing people with records -
Prison records.

890
00:48:58,167 --> 00:48:59,534
Interesting.

891
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:04,966
And who typically has
a prison record?

892
00:49:06,767 --> 00:49:09,734
I don't know.

893
00:49:09,767 --> 00:49:11,100
Bad guys?

894
00:49:12,467 --> 00:49:13,734
Bad guys.

895
00:49:14,966 --> 00:49:16,367
Do you think
it could be a -

896
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,400
A pattern?
Maybe.

897
00:49:19,534 --> 00:49:22,267
We'll run all the victims' dna
against the criminal database.

898
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,000
D.C. Lab is still open.

899
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:28,100
Come on.
Let's get to work.

900
00:49:44,434 --> 00:49:45,734
Dexter, what?

901
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:46,867
You were right.

902
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,767
I'm sorry to wake you up,

903
00:49:48,801 --> 00:49:50,634
But i had to let you know
that you were right.

904
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:51,933
About what?

905
00:49:51,966 --> 00:49:53,600
The program.

906
00:49:53,634 --> 00:49:56,000
It's...

907
00:49:56,033 --> 00:49:59,634
it's good.
It's really good.

908
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:04,367
I...
am always so in my head.

909
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,467
But this - It was...

910
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,901
good.

911
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,367
In fact,
it's already helped me a lot.

912
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,600
Thank you.

913
00:50:14,634 --> 00:50:16,133
Oh.

914
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:20,500
Mmm.

915
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,100
Oh, i do love this car.

916
00:50:30,133 --> 00:50:31,901
Yeah, i thought you might.

917
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:38,434
So, i will pick you up
in an hour.

918
00:50:38,467 --> 00:50:41,667
We'll go someplace nice
for lunch.

919
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,634
Oh, there's my sponsor.

920
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:44,801
Really? Where?

921
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:47,300
The guy in the blue shirt?

922
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,133
No, next to him - Lila.

923
00:50:55,133 --> 00:50:56,100
Huh.

924
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:58,667
Bye.

925
00:51:03,267 --> 00:51:06,333
I'm back.
