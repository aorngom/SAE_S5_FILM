1
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,910
Previously on "dexter"

1
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,510
I'm sorry

2
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,610
It doesn't change the fact that 
you slept with another woman.

3
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,980
What do they have on me?

4
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,180
They found something in your car.

5
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,350
Oh, shit.

6
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,780
Our primary suspect is someone you know well --

7
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,110
Sergeant james doakes.

8
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,810
He had the slides.

9
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,550
You know me, maria. that's not me.

10
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,310
Don't you disappear on me, james.

11
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,880
What exactly is sergeant doakes' 
problem with you, morgan?

12
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,350
I always sensed there was something...

13
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,280
Off about him.

14
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,580
From here on out,

15
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,650
We'll want a protective detail on you at all times.

16
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,450
You're a good cop like your old man.

17
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,080
Do you think they know?

18
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,780
Not until you tell them.

19
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,480
He is not your man.

20
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,710
He may be your ex-partner. he may be your best friend.

21
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,280
What he is to me is a suspect.

22
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,710
Lila, what are you doing here?

23
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,680
She came to see me, bro.

24
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,480
Are you pissed or something about lila and me?

25
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,050
Lila's just using you to get at me. so what?

26
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,150
A secret cabin in the middle of the everglades --

27
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,210
What more could a rededicated serial killer ask for?

28
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,510
Jesus christ. you're the bay harbor butcher.

30
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,010
You're gonna have to kill me, morgan!

31
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,980
You're gonna have to fucking kill me, morgan!

32
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,580
Is it deep? I hope it's fucking deep.

33
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,410
It's a graze wound. minor tissue abrasion.

34
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,710
No hemorrhage along the bullet track.

35
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,650
Sorry. I think I'm gonna live.

36
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,280
Am i?

37
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,380
That's a good question.

38
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,980
If you're not gonna let me go, morgan, then kill me now.

39
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,280
Just get it over with.

40
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,310
I'd advise you not to tempt me just now.

41
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,450
Why couldn't you just leave me to do my work in peace?

42
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,310
Why'd you have to go and ruin everything?

43
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,080
You're a killer. I catch killers.

44
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,710
So do i. I caught you.

45
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,580
I'm not a killer.

46
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,550
You are.

47
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,050
That's why you've always known what I am.

48
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,750
That's why you have more officer-related shootings

49
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,810
Than anybody else.

50
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,310
Only I don't fuck with you when you shoot somebody.

51
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,950
Why couldn't you pay me the same professional courtesy?

52
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,250
There's nothing professional about what you do.

53
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,480
I kill when I have to -- on the job.

54
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,650
Oh, so it's okay to take a life

55
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,080
As long as you get a paycheck for it?

56
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,310
The city pays me to keep the law.

57
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,980
I've got news for you, sergeant.

58
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,350
My code requires a higher standard of proof

59
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,110
Than your city's laws.

60
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,150
At zero cost for the taxpayer?

61
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,150
If you ask me, I'm a bargain.

62
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,910
That's enough bullshit, morgan.

63
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,680
Let's get this over with.

64
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,180
Either kill me or set me free.

65
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,880
I actually think you'd like it if I killed you,

66
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,350
Just to prove your point.

67
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,750
Morgan, you got to choose.

68
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,010
No, I need to go home.

69
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,810
I've got fbi guards standing outside my door right now...

70
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,450
...to protect me from you.

71
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,780
What's it gonna be, morgan?!

72
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,880
Morgan, what's it gonna be?!

73
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,950
Kill me now or set me free!

74
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,180
You only have two choices, morgan!

75
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,450
You can't fucking ignore me!

76
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,380
What's wrong?

77
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,650
The place is a ghost town this early.

78
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,780
Besides, I thought we were out as a couple.

79
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,180
Out and flaunting it are two different things.

80
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,750
"don't ask, don't tell"?

81
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,250
Works for the military.

82
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,080
Not really.

83
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,080
Oh, excellent.

84
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,310
My subpoena for doakes' phone records came through.

85
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,180
He isn't much of a talker.

86
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,280
Not a lot of friends, I'm guessing.

87
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,410
Except for one -- check this out.

88
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,950
That's lieutenant laguerta's phone number,

89
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,310
And look at the time and date.

90
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,010
Doakes called her right after we launched the manhunt.

91
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,510
We could have traced that call.

92
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,080
Doubt it.

93
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,380
Sergeant doakes wouldn't have stayed on long enough,

94
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,410
But laguerta should have given us the chance.

95
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,510
You're gonna ream her, aren't you?

96
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,080
Can I be there when you do it?

97
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,510
It's kind of a hobby of mine.

98
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,380
You can ream her yourself.

99
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,550
Me?

100
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,210
I can't dress down my own boss.

101
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,080
It's your subpoena. your case.

102
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,050
Ourcase.

103
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,780
And I need to know if your lieutenant can be counted on.

104
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,450
You know her better than I do.

105
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,380
Lox? ugh, gross.

106
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,350
Seriously, that would just get me in deeper shit with her,

107
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,510
And laguerta already hates me.

108
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,480
You know, I'm not always gonna be around to run interference.

109
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,280
Oh, come on.

110
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,080
You got at least five, 10 good years left in you.

111
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,050
I mean I won't be around once this case ends,

112
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,280
So a reaming will be good practice for you after I'm gone.

113
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,480
I better refrigerate this.

114
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,150
Taking a life is one thing,

115
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,910
But the care and feeding of it is another.

116
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,410
I can't keep my problem locked away in a cabin forever.

117
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,650
Harry always said

118
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,150
There were plenty of people who deserved to die,

119
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,610
But no matter how hard I close my eyes and wish,

120
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,250
Doakes isn't one of them.

121
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,350
Harry, you never prepared me for this one.

122
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,450
What do I do?

123
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,510
What would you do?

124
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,810
Get a description of juan ryness

125
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,410
To every patrol unit in the city,

126
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,710
And wake up judge morehouse.

127
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,780
I need a warrant for ryness' apartment immediately.

128
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,510
Fisk, make sure you get that print...

129
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,150
She was dumped?

130
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,650
Debra, get back inside the car like I told you.

131
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,710
Blunt trauma to the head?

132
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,210
I went over there. no one saw.

133
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,210
The blow to the head killed her.

134
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,110
She took a brutal beating beforehand.

135
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,210
The guy who did this is an evil bastard.

136
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,380
You know who it was? oh, yeah.

137
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,850
I've been trying to nail him for a while.

138
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,880
A pimp named juan ryness. she was one of his girls.

139
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,810
She was dumped, right?

140
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,750
Get back in the truck.

141
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,410
You awake?

142
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,680
You for real?

143
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,650
You got a visitor.

144
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,980
Coffee?

145
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,550
Yeah. why not?

146
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,380
I heard the news. it's everywhere.

147
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,410
Sergeant doakes is the bay harbor butcher?

148
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,610
That's what they're saying.

149
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,080
I was right about you, dexter.

150
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,780
Are you okay?

151
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,010
Why is the fbi guarding your building?

152
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,280
Oh, you know the federal government --

153
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,380
Any excuse to spend money.

155
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,650
It's cold.

156
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,550
Sorry.

157
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,610
Well, there's nothing better on a muggy miami morning

158
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,950
Than an iced coffee, right?

159
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,910
How are the kids?

160
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,110
They asked about you again.

161
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,280
And they've been pretty confused since we split up.

162
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,850
Yeah. me too.

163
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,010
Are you still confused?

164
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:00,310
I'm generally confused most of the time...

165
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,110
But not about us.

166
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,650
Good.

167
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,110
No.

168
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,080
It's not good?

169
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,750
No. it's, um, great...

170
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,450
To have this clarity.

171
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,680
I'm really glad you feel that way, dexter.

172
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,880
The kids have been through so much lately.

173
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,950
With paul's death and my mom moving out,

174
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,810
I don't want them to feel

175
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,510
Like they've been abandoned by everyone they love.

176
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,650
Does this mean we're dating again?

177
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,710
That would be kind of fast, wouldn't it?

178
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,450
I mean, you're so important to them,

179
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,380
And they need you.

180
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,210
But I don't know.

181
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,850
I mean, maybe we could just...

182
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,450
Hang.

183
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,950
Like a sloth.

184
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,510
I can do that.

185
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,310
Well, if you're free on saturday,

186
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,810
We're gonna spend the day at the beach,

187
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,080
And maybe we could all hang together.

188
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,310
A family of sloths.

190
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,250
Let me get you some ice.

191
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,180
I've been selfish --

192
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,510
Only thinking about what happens to me.

193
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,410
But if I were ever revealed as the true bay harbor butcher,

194
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,350
Rita and her children would be destroyed.

195
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,050
Lieutenant?

196
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Yes, morgan.

197
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,410
I need you to take a look at these.

198
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,880
I know what they are.

199
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,750
You didn't report the call from doakes.

200
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:22,080
Your task force doesn't need my help railroading a good cop.

201
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,810
Doakes was officially a person of interest.

202
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,080
Not reporting that call

203
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,280
Could be considered aiding and abetting.

204
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,180
None of you wanted to hear what he had to say,

205
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,510
So I didn't tell you.

206
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,250
What did he have to say?

207
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,610
That he's innocent.

208
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,080
And you believe him?

209
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,210
What do you think?

210
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,780
And if he calls again?

211
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,480
He won't.

212
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,750
And you know this? because I know him.

213
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,610
I thought I knew someone, too.

214
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,250
I know him.

215
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,250
So if lundy wants to flag me to captain matthews,

216
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,080
You tell him to go for it.

217
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,450
But james knows that I believe in him,

218
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,180
So it was worth the risk.

219
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,150
To your job?

220
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,010
To your career?

221
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,310
You ever care about anyone, morgan?

222
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,680
Yes.

223
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,450
Then you shouldn't have to ask.

224
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,710
Cause when you care about someone,

225
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,580
You do what you have to do.

226
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,950
Four different aliases -- all issued by the d.o.d.

227
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,450
During doakes' stint with special forces.

228
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,880
We've attached these names to our temporary felony want,

229
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,380
So if he uses one, we'll be notified.

230
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,410
I remember when life was easy,

231
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,950
When the only question I worried about was "who's next?"

232
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,180
Now it's, "how can I dodge my protective detail?

233
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,480
What should I do with my hostage?"

234
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,910
These are not easy questions.

235
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,210
Morgan, would you bring us up to speed

236
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,810
On the analysis from the blood slides?

237
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,250
Of the 46 slides,

238
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,910
18 belonged to previously known butcher victims.

239
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,410
We're still running the dna,

240
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,150
But we've matched an additional 12

241
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,950
With felons in the criminal database, all reported missing.

242
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,550
We'll proceed on the assumption

243
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,550
That these 12 were bay harbor victims.

244
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,810
It's a fair assumption.

245
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,910
Officer morgan, do you have the new victims' jackets?

246
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,710
Sorry, sir. not my responsibility.

247
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,410
That'd be me.

248
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,850
Each of the 12 had at least one homicide on their records,

249
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,180
And we all know how the butcher loves a killer.

250
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,550
We're checking into their last known whereabouts

251
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,780
And any connection that their criminal cases

252
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,610
May have had with sergeant doakes.

253
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,080
Forensics, expect a steady stream of evidence seized

254
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,280
From our suspect's apartment over the next few hours.

255
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,650
You're looking for any trace evidence

256
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,110
That could connect him to these victims.

257
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,780
The rest of you have your assignments.

258
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,550
Let's bring him in, folks.

259
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,480
Special agent lundy?

260
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,280
Dexter, is your sister all right?

261
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,250
I wouldn't know.

262
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,180
But I wanted to talk to you about my protective detail.

263
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,980
Angel, I hear you have 12 new butcher victims.

264
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,350
Potential victims.

265
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,210
You got names?

266
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,580
Mind if I keep this?

267
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,950
We're all working together now.

268
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,380
Why? you got an angle on doakes?

269
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,310
Oh, yeah. that's good.

270
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,950
That's real good.

271
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,550
This is a waste of time.

272
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,710
If doakes is the butcher,

273
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,780
We're not gonna find trace evidence on his clothes.

274
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,480
The guy we're after is way too careful for that.

275
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,210
I have to agree with you there.

276
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,650
You think it could be doakes?

277
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,780
It's not about what I think. it's all about the evidence.

278
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,510
All those times you called me "lab geek,"

279
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,050
"fairy winkle," "donkey fluffer"...

280
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,750
...i'm just glad I took it lying down, you know?

281
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,180
What the fuck, dex?

282
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,850
What which fuck?

283
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,080
You told lundy to pull your protective detail?

284
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,010
Oh, she's gonna hit you, isn't she?

285
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,380
She's gonna hit someone if you don't get the fuck out of here.

286
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,110
Hair-pulling may not be manly, but it's very effective.

287
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Doakes fucking hates you, dex.

288
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,810
No doubt about that. and he's a trained killer.

289
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,810
If he wanted me dead, it would have happened by now.

290
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,380
Is that supposed to be reassuring?

291
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,480
Doakes is a lot of things, but he's not an idiot.

292
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,750
He won't come out of the shadows because of a grudge.

293
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,210
Right.

294
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,680
Cause serial killers are so practical.

295
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,780
Actually, they are.

296
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,010
Deb, I'm safer with lundy's troops hunting doakes

297
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,280
Than babysitting me.

298
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,280
Lundy agrees.

299
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,010
That's 'cause lundy doesn't give a shit!

300
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,510
All he cares about is solving this case and moving on!

301
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,580
I thought he was the guy you could count on.

302
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,210
You are the only one I can count on, jackass.

303
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,080
Deb.

304
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,150
Got to give deb credit for one thing --

305
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,080
She knows how to express her feelings.

306
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,210
If I was convicted as the butcher,

307
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,210
She'd probably explode.

308
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,180
It'd be a waste of a perfectly good cop...

309
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,910
And sister.

310
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,110
This isn't just about me anymore.

311
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,410
It's about deb and rita and the kids.

312
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,250
I have only one choice for doakes.

313
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,810
Shit.

314
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,180
All right.

315
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,880
Yes.

316
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,810
No reason for you to suffer.

318
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,350
You come to a decision?

319
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,850
Yes, but I don't think you're gonna like it.

320
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,710
So this is the way it ends.

321
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,050
Regardless of how we got here,

322
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,750
One of the two killers in this cabin has to go away.

323
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,180
I am not a killer.

324
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,210
Right.

325
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,880
In terms of who goes,

326
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,380
It boiled down to a philosophical question --

327
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:56,910
Which one of us has more inherent worth?

328
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,610
I know you're fucking kidding me.

329
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,150
First I considered our value to the community.

330
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,080
That was a wash.

331
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,310
We're both loyal civil servants.

332
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,780
We work hard to keep the city clean.

333
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,680
You cut people up into little pieces.

334
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,850
Then I looked at our personal lives.

335
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,810
And, well...

336
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,210
That's where the differences became clearer.

337
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,410
Strange as it may seem,

338
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,350
I have people who depend on me.

339
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,910
They would be devastated if they found out what I do.

340
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,410
You, sergeant,

341
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,710
You're more of a lone wolf -- easier to put down.

342
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,610
No one in the pack to miss you.

343
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,550
Fuck you.

344
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,880
Fuck you, morgan. I have a family.

345
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,580
I have my mother and my sisters.

346
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,250
Who you never visit.

347
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,850
It puts a pit in my stomach

348
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,880
That I can only interpret as...

349
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,250
Sadness.

350
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,780
If you had a personal life,

351
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,650
You might not have made me your obsession,

352
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,250
And we wouldn't be here right now.

353
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,750
Sergeant, why would you hide

354
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,550
A dead drug dealer's cellphone from me?

355
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,950
You working on an exit strategy?

356
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,750
I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.

357
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,850
If you want to bring me down, morgan,

358
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,050
You're gonna have to open this goddamn cage first.

359
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,050
So come on. bring it.

360
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,650
I already did. you just didn't know it.

361
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,850
Mother fuck...

362
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,280
The sedative works fast.

363
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,610
It's probably best just to go with it.

364
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,580
You think you're a fucking hero, don't you?

365
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,710
Cleaning up the fucking streets.

366
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,350
Your old man would be proud.

367
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,350
My old man was proud.

368
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,980
He knew?

369
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,950
He really was a fucking whack job.

370
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,480
Name-calling at this juncture?

371
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,480
What's the point?

372
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,050
Besides, my father was a legend on the force.

373
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,310
Is that what you think?

374
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,710
They never told you.

375
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,750
Told me? told me what?

376
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,850
Hey!

377
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,450
What about my father?

378
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,480
What about my father?

380
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,910
A missed call.

381
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,910
If it's dexter, tell him to come over.

382
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,810
I have auri on saturday.

383
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,450
Auri? what's an auri?

384
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,910
It's my little girl.

385
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,980
My ex never lets me see her on the weekends,

386
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,050
But something came up.

387
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,180
I have her all day on saturday.

388
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,780
Mm. delightful.

389
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,750
But tonight you belong to me...

390
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,750
Yes.

391
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,410
...and my walls.

392
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,610
Doakes said I had two choices --

393
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,080
Kill him or let him go.

394
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,180
But he neglected to look behind door number three --

395
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,110
Hand him over to the fbi gift-wrapped.

396
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,980
I don't need doakes dead.

397
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,410
I just need his fingerprints to complete my frame job.

398
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,310
Almost forgot.

399
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,050
One needs small comforts.

400
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,280
Every saturday, beginning dive classes

401
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,450
Practice underwater skills beside this dock.

402
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,450
Tomorrow they'll find a morbid little surprise.

403
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,280
When the feds receive these kill tools

404
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,210
With their suspect's prints on them,

405
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,610
The only threat to me will be

406
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,980
The inane rants of a murderous madman.

407
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,910
So close, I can feel it.

408
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,350
This tragic tale might still end in doakes' demise,

409
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,580
But not by my hands.

410
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,880
Harry's legacy will remain intact.

411
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,380
Harry...

412
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,450
Why in the hell did doakes have to bring up harry?

413
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,010
Come on.

414
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,580
You just cut the cake, sweetheart.

415
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,910
I'll see who it is.

416
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,380
Tom. this is a surprise. come on in.

417
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,710
Oh, thanks.

418
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,880
Sweetheart, cut the lieutenant a slice.

419
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,280
It's her birthday.

420
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,680
Oh! well, happy birthday, hon.

421
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,010
But no cake for me, thanks.

422
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,510
Can I talk to you in private for a second? sure.

423
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,850
Save me an end piece.

424
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,050
God damn it!

425
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,780
Ryness is gonna walk because of a goddamn typo?!

426
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,610
Faulty warrant, harry. there's nothing we can do.

427
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,380
This is bullshit! harry!

428
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,980
Now, look, don't worry.

429
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,510
Ryness will make another mistake. yeah, right.

430
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,050
We just got wait for him to kill another girl!

431
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,010
Sorry.

432
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,880
Happy birthday, kiddo.

433
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,510
I'll get the vacuum cleaner.

434
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,050
You okay, dad?

435
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,310
I did the right thing in training you.

436
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,610
This just proves it.

437
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,480
I did the right thing.

438
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,810
Debra.

439
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,450
Will you wait?

440
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,710
What's going on here?

441
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,650
Nothing, according to you.

442
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,050
So I said something?

443
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,310
Only that this relationship has an expiration date.

444
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:28,050
If you want to write it off before it even begins, go ahead.

445
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,350
When did I say that?

446
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,110
Yesterday morning, you said, "when the case ends, we end."

447
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,280
I'm paraphrasing.

448
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:38,450
Debra, I thought you understood when we got involved.

449
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,710
I track killers. that's what I do.

450
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,350
They tend to move around. I know that.

451
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,410
Then I'm not sure

452
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,710
What you thought would happen when the case ended.

453
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:52,250
Honestly, I hadn't thought about it,

454
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,350
But it looks like you have, so now I know.

455
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,350
Consider me informed.

456
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,710
One.

457
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,810
How come there's never a circus when you need one?

458
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,210
I don't know.

459
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,150
I'm not sure I've ever felt that particular need.

460
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,510
Help me out here.

461
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,950
What does a 7-year-old girl like?

462
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,450
Astor likes cnn.

463
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,810
Yeah. that's not gonna fly.

464
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,410
I got auri all day on saturday.

465
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,480
I want to do something fun -- ideally, a lot more fun

466
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,880
Than the stuff her mother does with her.

467
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,250
It's really not that hard to entertain a kid.

468
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,910
Rita and I are taking hers to the beach on saturday.

469
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,810
See, now, that sounds perfect.

470
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,980
It'd be great if we could tag along.

472
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,050
Sure, I guess.

473
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,180
We'll be there all afternoon.

474
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,310
Sorry, but what's with the highlights?

475
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,080
I was helping lila paint her loft last night.

476
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,650
Red -- the color of pasióN.

477
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,280
Yeah. about lila.

478
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,680
Uh, it's probably better for everyone

479
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,810
If she doesn't come along on saturday.

480
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,950
Bro, I'm not stupid.

481
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,710
Lila is like my after-hours project.

482
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,750
Besides, she should stay off the beach with skin like that.

483
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,210
Like a perfect porcelain doll.

484
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,510
"paid 4 my lift ticket. where's my snow?

485
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,780
Don't make me come after u."

486
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,650
Sounds like mr. harlow is not only a master of metaphor,

487
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,250
But also inclined toward violent confrontation.

488
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,110
Better find out who he is in case I have to deal with him.

489
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,310
Armed with a phone number,

490
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,180
Obtaining the mysterious text-messenger's i.d.

491
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,450
Wasn't too hard, but is he a threat?

492
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,310
"christopher harlow -- known alias for jose garza.

493
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,410
"narcotics, armed robbery,

494
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,210
"and currently a fugitive from justice for murder.

495
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,850
Approach with caution."

496
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,350
This guy could be trouble if he has knowledge

497
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,380
Of a certain cabin in the everglades.

498
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,810
I'm safe.

499
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,450
Happy trails, harlow.

500
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,680
Deb?

501
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,610
Fuck! sneak much?

502
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,250
Sorry. I wanted to ask you something.

503
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,580
That is some big hair.

504
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:52,350
Hard to believe he's our guy.

505
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,050
Amazing how easy it is to hide who you are from people, huh?

506
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,880
Not that easy.

507
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:03,450
I was thinking about your birthday.

508
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,580
You got like three months.

509
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,410
Just get me a gift certificate at amazon.

510
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,110
Good to know, but the birthday I was thinking about was...

511
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,050
When dad threw the beer bottle.

512
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,910
Jesus.

513
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,810
Out of the blue, dex. what brought that up?

514
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,780
Harry's been on my mind lately.

515
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,450
I was trying to remember...

516
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,750
Matthews came over that night, right?

517
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,280
Yeah.

518
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,480
He and dad got in a fight.

519
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,350
I ended up wiping beer off the walls.

520
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,010
Happy birthday to me.

521
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:44,710
A killer went free. that would upset any cop, right?

522
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,650
Nothing weird about that.

523
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,910
No, it wasn't weird.

524
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,250
It was just another example of dad's priorities.

525
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,710
Kids versus case -- case always won.

526
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,180
Did he say anything else about it to you?

527
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,610
Right.

528
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,610
Dad sitting down with me to have a heart-to-heart.

529
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,350
Not that I didn't want to.

530
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,950
Maybe you should have told him that.

531
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,950
Yeah.

532
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,450
Maybe.

533
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,250
Deb had it rough.

534
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,580
Harry had his hands full teaching me a trade.

535
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,010
But was there something else going on with him,

536
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,510
Or was doakes just trying to shake me up?

537
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,010
I need to know if there's more to the story.

538
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:39,780
There's a complication I don't need.

539
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,110
Hey, baby, what brings you back?

540
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,280
I have two more walls at home

541
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,080
Waiting for your expertise as a painter.

542
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:50,750
Oh, there's nothing I'd like to do more, but...

543
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,210
But what, darling?

544
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,880
I'm picking up auri, remember?

545
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,780
We're meeting dexter and rita at the beach.

546
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:01,150
You know, I have a friend at miami art museum --

547
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,610
Teaches an incredible children's class.

548
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,110
Air-conditioned.

549
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,180
You could bring the whole gang if you like.

550
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,910
You mind if I take a rain check?

551
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,310
You know, with your history with dexter,

552
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,180
It might be a little awkward.

553
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,310
He's trying to work things out with rita.

554
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,610
Oh, is he, now?

555
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,210
Well, you have a great day.

556
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,850
And, um, watch out for those sand fleas.

557
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,050
Damn. she better be worth it.

558
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,610
What was that shit last night?

559
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,610
Some kind of fucking scare tactic?

560
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,650
You said something before you passed out about my father.

561
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,780
What was it?

562
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,310
I don't know. what was it?

563
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,250
I was kind of drugged at the time.

564
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,650
Don't test me, sergeant.

565
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,280
I could have killed you.

566
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,610
I didn't.

567
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,810
You didn't because you can't.

568
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,750
I've had time to think about this, morgan.

569
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,250
I don't fit that code you were talking about, do i?

570
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,850
At first, I thought the butcher only went after criminals

571
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,080
Because nobody gives a goddamn what happens to them,

572
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,710
But now...

573
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,450
Now I think you got a conscience.

574
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,910
Of course I have a conscience.

575
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,180
I left you a place to shit, didn't i?

576
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,050
It's a small conscience.

577
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,910
You're actually angry.

578
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,380
I've never seen you angry. this is good.

579
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,280
I might live to see the outside of this goddamn cabin after all.

580
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,610
What'd you say about harry?

581
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,610
I believe the words "whack job" were involved.

582
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,980
Oh, yeah.

583
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,980
Is that what you're worried about, man?

584
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:21,980
I guess it would bother me, too, if it were my old man.

585
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,710
Sergeant.

586
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,380
Okay. what the fuck?

587
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,710
You know how I've been looking into your past, right?

588
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,950
That's why you're in a cage.

589
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,910
I found something I wasn't supposed to see.

590
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,550
It's about your father's death.

591
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,810
Heart disease -- big mystery.

592
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,610
No, the mystery's bigger than that.

593
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,810
And someone up high didn't want it solved.

594
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,280
You're lying.

595
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,450
It was buried deep, but it was there.

596
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,410
What was there?

597
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:11,080
How about we go outside and talk about this, man?

598
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,810
I could use some air.

599
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,550
Not gonna happen.

600
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,580
Yeah, well, then the mystery remains.

601
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:33,310
I'm sure special ops taught you to rattle your captor,

602
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,080
But I should warn you, sergeant.

603
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,510
You can't play on my feelings.

604
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,710
I don't have any.

605
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,810
Oh, really?

606
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,750
Who's lying now?

607
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,380
Sit down. that's it.

609
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,510
Hello, dexter. captain.

610
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,850
Please. I'm a civilian today. call me tom.

611
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,510
You start your round yet?

612
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:21,110
I'm afraid bayshore is a little outside my pay scale.

613
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,310
so, what brings you out here on a Saturday morning?

614
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I wanna know there's anything unusual about my father's death.

615
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Uh, go on ahead. I'll catch up.

616
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:40,380
His heart gave out. you know that.

617
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,650
I heard there was more to it.

618
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,980
From whom?

619
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,380
Does it matter?

620
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,310
I guess it was inevitable you'd find out one of these days.

621
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,350
You know, harry was a good friend.

622
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,680
He was a great cop.

623
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,810
But, um...

624
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,880
It's a tough job.

625
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,850
It can wear on even the best of us.

626
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,780
My father was always firmly in control.

627
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:12,510
That he was, but towards the end...

628
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,510
Look, dexter.

629
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,550
The system doesn't always work.

630
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,010
Sometimes they get away. you know that.

631
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:24,550
And that just got harder and harder for harry to deal with.

632
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,950
I think that's what did him in in the end.

633
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,280
What did?

634
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,750
What am I missing here?

635
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,510
He killed himself, dexter.

636
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,480
How?

637
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:53,550
The autopsy showed an overdose of his heart medicine.

638
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,180
That happens all the time.

639
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,180
People accidentally take the wrong dose.

640
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,650
He called me the day before he died.

641
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,850
He asked me to keep an eye on you and your sister.

642
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,250
I didn't realize what that call meant until he was gone.

643
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,710
So I made sure that autopsy never saw the light of day.

644
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:18,210
I was looking out for the two of you like I said I would.

645
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,310
I'm sorry, dexter.

646
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,750
Listen, why don't we go to the club and have a drink?

647
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,080
We can talk some more.

648
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,150
No.

649
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,210
Thank you.

650
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,180
The legendary harry morgan --

651
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:48,010
Force for justice, architect of all that I am.

652
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,710
Suicide.

653
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,750
It doesn't make sense.

654
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,050
Special agent lundy.

655
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,580
I have good news.

656
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,780
I could use it. what do you got?

657
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,910
Proof that james doakes

658
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,950
Can't possibly be the bay harbor butcher.

659
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,480
You're looking at the documentation of a stakeout

660
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,980
That james and I were on as partners seven years ago.

661
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,450
Very detailed.

662
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,780
We were doing surveillance when one of your new victims,

663
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,310
Larry mueller, went missing.

664
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,810
James and I were holed up in a motel room 24/7 for two weeks.

665
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,750
He didn't have time to piss,

666
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,980
Much less abduct and murder a man.

667
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:39,850
I respect your compassion for a friend and colleague,

668
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,950
But I'm afraid this proves nothing.

669
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,980
No, it proves that he was with me.

670
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,950
It's all here -- specific dates and times.

671
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,350
These are my personal stakeout logs.

672
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,450
And they're very thorough, but I can't use them.

673
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,180
No. no. this is bullshit.

674
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,050
You got to be fucking kidding me.

675
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,350
You can't just ignore legitimate evidence.

676
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,380
I can, and I will ignore it

677
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,950
Because you gave me no choice, lady.

678
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,380
Those are your personal logs,

679
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,980
And your credibility was compromised

680
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,880
The second you failed to report a phone call

681
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,680
From the subject of a goddamn fbi manhunt.

682
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,680
It was a breach of protocol and ethics,

683
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,110
And you're lucky I don't bring you up on charges.

684
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:25,010
What really pisses me off...

685
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,610
Is you might be right.

686
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,510
But in trying to protect your friend,

687
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,710
You blew the best shot we had of bringing him in from the cold.

688
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:37,010
Come back to me if you find evidence I can use.

689
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,280
I smell...

690
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,610
Monster meat!

691
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,280
Aah!

692
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,950
I got ya!

693
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:01,310
Nyah-nyah,

694
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,810
I tagged you.

695
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,510
So?

696
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,010
So you're a monster now.

697
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,250
Really? yeah.

698
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,380
Come on, socio. I'm sucking gas here.

699
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:14,680
Sorry, angel. my leg's a little tight today.

700
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,080
Aah!

701
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,010
It's too soon, isn't it?

702
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:31,150
For this. for us.

703
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,850
No.

704
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:37,510
Rita, that's not it at all.

705
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,350
Then what is it?

706
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,750
Dexter?

707
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:52,750
I always thought my father died of heart disease.

708
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,280
And I just found out that's not true.

709
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,510
He committed suicide.

710
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,180
Oh, god.

711
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,680
I don't know why he would do that to himself...

712
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,380
...or me.

713
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:18,950
Oh, baby.

714
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,050
Whatever harry did and why,

715
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,680
I can't let it distract me from my mission --

716
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,480
Not when freedom is so close.

717
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:38,250
"found out where your cabin is. on my way.

718
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,980
I want my fucking snow."

719
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,780
Shit.

720
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,150
No one appreciates uninvited houseguests.

721
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:59,080
Unless I can make the problem part of my solution.

722
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,680
Are you chad?

723
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,250
It depends on what you're looking for.

724
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,080
Tim said to come to you.

725
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,310
The rohypnol.

726
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,310
Roofies?

727
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:28,650
You?

728
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,150
You're just not my normal kind of customer.

729
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,180
Oh, do stop talking.

730
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,380
Good luck with that.

731
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,210
Thanks for coming.

732
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,510
I thought we should talk.

733
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,110
No. I should talk.

734
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:09,810
I mean, I yell a lot...

735
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,480
And bitch and complain,

736
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:15,350
And I keep expecting people to just guess what I want,

737
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,250
But I never really say it.

738
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,010
I'd like to hear it.

739
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:28,350
You asked me what I thought would happen

740
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,010
When the case ended.

741
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:35,410
And the truth is, I had no fucking idea.

742
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:38,410
And that was...

743
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,610
Exciting, you know?

744
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:43,610
The not knowing.

745
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,210
What might happen. what could be.

746
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:50,750
It was all possibility.

747
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:58,310
And when you just assumed that we ended when the case ended,

748
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,050
You crushed that.

749
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,210
And I want it back.

750
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:11,380
Want to know what I thought would happen

751
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,680
When the case ended?

752
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:13,950
What?

753
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,510
I thought the novelty of my aarp discount would wear off,

754
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,410
And you'd get tired of me.

755
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,210
Oh, my god.

756
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:27,010
That's the sweetest thing you've ever said.

757
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,250
Lundy.

758
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,880
On our way.

759
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,210
What do we got?

760
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,110
A hit on one of doakes' false i.d.'s at a car-rental agency.

761
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,880
Make, model, and license plate.

762
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,280
Let's go.

763
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,810
My hero.

764
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,650
This place looks like brand-new.

765
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,650
It's my pleasure,

766
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,350
Though I feel a little loopy from the fumes.

767
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:24,880
So how was your day at the beach?

768
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:27,280
Auri wore me out.

769
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:30,080
You ever try and run in the sand?

770
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:33,650
I never run. you're a better man than me.

771
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,850
I'm glad you think so.

772
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,710
And how are dexter and rita?

773
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:43,610
Things are good for them.

774
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:45,080
I mean...

775
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:48,010
I think they're gonna work things out.

776
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,710
We going somewhere?

777
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:12,280
Well, you know, I've been trying to hold off.

778
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,810
But, uh...

779
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:20,910
I don't know. I don't want to anymore.

780
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:23,710
I think it's time.

781
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,510
I need you.

782
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:28,450
Mm. you can have me.

783
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,750
The thing is... I like it rough.

786
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,750
Okay.

787
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:46,150
Who the fuck is that?

788
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,480
Some guy I picked up in a bar.

789
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,510
He's a known murderer and your final victim.

790
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:55,250
You're not gonna do what I think you are?

791
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,850
There's no point in hiding it now, sergeant.

792
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,510
You're life is going to rest in the hands

793
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:03,780
Of the criminal justice system you put all your faith in.

794
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:08,410
I wish you the best of luck. come on, morgan.

795
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:10,680
We were just getting somewhere, you and me.

796
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,010
You ain't got to do this.

797
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,580
Come on. we'll find a way.

798
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:17,750
I'm afraid this is the only way for me.

799
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:23,380
Excuse me. I need to get my supplies.

800
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,880
Morgan!

801
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,750
You are a very bad girl.

803
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:47,880
I'm only just getting started, baby.

804
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:49,880
Be right back.

806
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,350
Lila, you want a beer?

807
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,780
Jesus.

808
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,710
This is detective angel batista from miami metro homicide.

809
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,210
I need an ambulance.

810
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:14,880
There is no way people are gonna believe I did this shit.

811
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:18,750
You were u.s. special forces. I'm sure you have done this.

812
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,950
Wartime circumstances -- heat of the battle.

813
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,610
But never cold-blooded, morgan.

814
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:26,480
I'm sure that made things easier for you.

815
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:29,350
Morgan, god damn it, you got a conscience, man.

816
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,180
You said it yourself. you go after killers.

817
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,680
You take out killers. I get that.

818
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,450
But this -- this is some sick-fuck ritual, man.

819
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,050
You need help. let me help you, man.

820
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,880
Don't worry, sergeant. I won't make you watch.

821
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:41,010
I'm not uncivilized.

822
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:42,480
No. morgan. morgan, no!

823
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:43,550
Morgan!

824
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,180
You don't have to do this!

825
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:47,850
You don't have to kill this man!

826
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,610
This man is a felon with a body count.

827
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,150
He brought it on himself.

828
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,950
Morgan, turn him over to the law.

829
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,150
I live by my father's law.

830
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,810
No! morgan!

831
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:00,550
Morgan, don't do this!

832
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:10,510
Oh, shit.

833
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,350
Sorry it had to go down like this, sergeant.

834
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,050
But there really was no other way.

835
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:42,350
Sergeant?

836
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,050
Stay away.

837
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:51,050
Just stay away from me.

838
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,350
I've heard those words before --

839
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,250
Three days before my father's death.

840
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:04,410
Oh. hey, dad.

841
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:07,580
Look what I did.

842
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:14,410
It's juan ryness, the pimp who killed that girl.

843
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,080
I finally got him for you.

844
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,550
Dad, what's wrong? are you okay?

845
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:45,450
Just stay away...please.

846
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,010
Stay away.

847
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:53,550
It was me.

848
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,250
The idea of a code was one thing --

849
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,480
A grand idea. a noble cause.

850
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:02,210
But the reality of it?

851
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:06,350
Harry walked in on what he created...

852
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,180
And he couldn't live with himself.

853
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:20,510
What, morgan?

854
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,580
What now?

855
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,280
I killed my father.
