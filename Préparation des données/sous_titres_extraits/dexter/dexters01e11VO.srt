4
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,330
Previously on "dexter"...

5
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,460
so if you or that skinny bitch
try to screw with what's mine,

6
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,630
I swear to god,I don't
carewho I have to hurt.

7
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,660
Let's face it,paul. You've got a problem.

8
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,270
It's time for you to go away.

9
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,230
It's paul.

10
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,670
He violated florida'sthree-strikes law.

11
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,310
The cops picked him uptotally
strung out on heroin.

12
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,610
He's back in jail.

13
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,320
Holy shit!They're fucking fingertips.

14
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,640
He started getting all
roughwith me until he saw this.

15
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,470
Then what?

16
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,030
Then he changed his tune,got all turned on.

17
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,020
Told meto take my fake hand off.

18
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,860
He takes all my nail polish
and paints each naila different color.

19
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,890
Menthol?Like cough drops.

20
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,880
I could hear them clickingagainst
his teeth when he...

21
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,960
son of a bitch lovedthose fucking lozenges.

22
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,060
I was confusedbecause I love you.

23
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,340
What did you say?

24
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,810
I love you.

25
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,410
I love you,too.

26
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,910
What?What happened to your lip?

27
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,270
Aah!

28
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,530
No,it's -- I had an incidentwith
a tool at the workshop.

29
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,040
Ohh!

30
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,890
I need an ambulanceat 1228 calendar street.
A guy's been stabbed.

31
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,260
TRUTH BE TOLD

32
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,070
I've never had much use
for the concept of hell,

33
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,500
but if hell exists,I'm in it.

34
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,120
The same images running
through my head over and over.

35
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,290
I was there.

36
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,530
I saw my mother's death.

37
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,560
A buried memory,
forgotten all these years.

38
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,630
It climbed inside me that day.

39
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,020
And it's been with
me ever since --

40
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,460
my dark passenger.

41
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,550
You should befocusing on me,socio.

42
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,970
You should be
focusing on me,socio.

43
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,180
Seriously want to get
the motherfucker that did this to batista.

44
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,810
Hey.
You all right?

45
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,840
Yeah.
I'm okay.

46
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,690
I'm just,you know,
distraught about angel.

47
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,230
How's he doing?
Do we know?

48
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,830
Still in surgery.

49
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,630
Laguerta's there.

50
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,030
God,I hate feeling
so helpless.

51
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,490
What,no jokes about providinggross
sexual comfort in a time of crisis?

52
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,380
Our friend was stabbed...

53
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,470
and he might die.

54
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,220
Officer morgan.

55
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,110
What do you think,dex?

56
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,180
He put up a fight.There was a struggle.

57
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,950
Attaboy,angel.

58
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,980
Here,this trail
--steady stream of drops.

59
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,540
He had a few seconds.Tried
to move away until --

60
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,620
till he fell.

61
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,290
So much blood.

62
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,090
What's happening to me?

63
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,340
no way.

64
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,660
You're the oneI'm supposed to meet.

65
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,460
In the flesh.

66
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,960
You know,I was just
talkingto someone about you.

67
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,240
That tickles.

68
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,630
Don't stop.

69
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,580
I wouldn't dreamof stopping.

70
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,410
You're so differentthis
time -- gentle.

71
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,580
I thought you were gonnatry and
get all pervy with my stump again.

72
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,860
Actually,your...imperfection
is what saved youthe first time.

73
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,410
Saved me from what?

74
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,720
True artistry.

75
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,830
The message of my workis
not in the product itself,

76
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,070
but ratherthe presentation.

77
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,310
That wrinkled fleshon your radial
carpal joint is far from perfect.

78
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,160
It's quite unsightly,actually.

79
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,230
Hey,you don't have to bean asshole about it.

80
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,880
Hey,hey,no,no,no,no,no.
Shh,shh,shh,shh,shh,sh

81
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,900
I'm sorry.I didn't mean to offend.

82
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,360
Truthfully...

83
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,990
I'm thankful for you.

84
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,420
You're my escape plan.

85
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,930
Escape from what?

86
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,390
The police.

87
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,270
Because of you,I've
hadto speed up my project.

88
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,490
I need somethingto distract them by.

89
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,130
And I always founda freshly chopped-up body
always does the trick.

90
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,540
Wait,wait! No!

91
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,570
Don't struggle.That never helps.

92
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
I'm compressingyour carotid artery,

93
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,510
and that is cutting offoxygen to your brain.

94
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,620
In about 10 seconds,you'll be unconscious.

95
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,760
Hey,it's rudy. Leave a message.

96
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,800
Okay,I guess you went to bed.

97
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,460
Or you fell asleep on the
couchwatching "xena" reruns,

98
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,590
which I still thinkmakes you a dork.

99
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,760
Either way,call me when you get this,okay?

100
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,540
Miss you.

101
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,110
He's still in surgery,
but I don't knowwhen we'll hear anything.

102
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,510
So I guess you won't becoming over tonight.

103
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,400
No.I mean,I can'T.

104
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,350
I understand.
You need to be therefor your friend.

105
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,090
I haven't told the kids yet.

106
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,630
Told them about angel?

107
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,340
No,about paul...being back in prison?

108
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,590
I hatebreaking their hearts. They
think so muchof their dad now,and --

109
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,350
right.

110
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,880
You know what?

111
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,540
Focus on angel.We can
talk about this later.

112
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,830
Thanks.

113
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,460
They're actually coming
outright now. I got to go.

114
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,910
Angel sustainedsevere internal injuries.

115
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,300
He lost a lot of blood.

116
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,230
But...the surgerywas successful.

117
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,030
It looks like our boy'sout of the woods.

118
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,350
I know I should stay,be
a part of the group hug.

119
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,400
But I can't focus.

120
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,850
I'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.

121
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,250
I need to know what it means.

122
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,890
Morgan.

123
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,400
What the fuckis wrong with you?

124
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,370
I have someplaceI have to be.

125
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,030
Well,we all gotsomeplace to be.

126
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,670
But you just found out that somebody who
was supposedto be your friend is gonna live.

127
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,840
Does that make youfeel anything?

128
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,230
Anything at all?

129
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,630
Take your fucking handoff me.

130
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,630
Just whatI always thought.

131
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,380
Right.

132
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,890
Deck the hallswith parts of bodies

133
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,420
la-da-da-da dum

134
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,290
Shit.Just what I need.

135
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,480
Hey.

136
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,990
I know it's late.

137
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,660
I guess you didn't getmy message.

138
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,950
I drove byand saw your car.

139
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,630
I can go.

140
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,380
Get your ass in here.

141
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,370
It's about timeyou see where I live anyway.

142
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,350
Oh,you have no ideahow much I needed this.
You feel good.

143
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,290
And cold
--you're freezing.

144
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,590
Well,then stayand keep me warm.

145
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,070
This batista thinghas
gotten to you,hasn't it?

146
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,270
Angel's daughter was there.

147
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,890
That's got to be rough.

148
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,900
Daughter of a cop
--just like you.

149
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,330
Yeah.

150
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,290
I rememberwhat that's like --
kissing your father goodbye,

151
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,130
always afraidit's for the last time.

152
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,840
Hey...

153
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,200
let's get out of
townfor the weekend --

154
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,510
just the two of us.

155
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,210
We need to talk.

156
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,450
I'm sitting right here.

157
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,600
Nope.

158
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,250
The timehas got to be right.

159
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,250
Okay.

160
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,900
It'll have to wait...

161
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,740
at least till we catch theasshole
who did this to batista.

162
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,790
Let me warn you --I
can be very persistent.

163
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,610
I need to get out of town,

164
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,530
and I need youto come with me.

165
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,760
What I need is sleep,which
is not gonna be easy.

166
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,020
I'm totally wiredfrom all this shit.

167
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,860
Well,lucky for you,I have the perfect cure.

168
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,790
My loving arms.

169
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,420
And...I got a little thingto help you sleep.

170
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,740
That ain'tno little thing.

171
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,780
I meant valium.

172
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,050
It's one of the
perksworking at the hospital.

173
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,000
Wine and valium?

174
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,360
I'll be totally helpless.

175
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,070
You read my mind.

176
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,010
Well,as I live and breathe.

177
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,960
You miss me?

178
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,940
You and the bear clawsyou're
hiding behind your back.

179
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,350
This must be important.

180
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,150
Haven't seenmuch of you lately.

181
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,200
No rest for the wicked.

182
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,750
How's gene?

183
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,980
Good days and bad.

184
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,360
He just finished his
first roundof radiation.

185
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,620
Well,he's a good guy.

186
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,950
Not much of a bridge player,though.

187
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,940
Harry and geneused to get so mad

188
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,580
every time doris and iwould
take them to the cleaners.

189
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,720
I was hoping you could dig
upan old case file for me.

190
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,220
Well,sure thing.Got a date?

191
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,970
Uh,not exactly.

192
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,950
It's the crime scenewhere harry found me.

193
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,380
Uh...I wish I could help,but...

194
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,780
everything from that long ago
is boxed up in the basementat city hall.

195
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,060
And...as you can see,

196
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,560
I'm up to my you-know-whatin
year-end reports,so...

197
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,390
It's my lieutenant.

198
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,330
Camilla,is there anythingyou remember?

199
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,290
What I remember,dexter morgan,is
your father caring enough

200
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,000
to bring you into his homeand
give you a loving family.

201
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,000
I wouldn't keepyour lieutenant waiting.

202
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,540
Who found the body parts?

203
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,040
I did. They were leftunder the tree.

204
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,720
I thought it was the crewfrom last night
just messing around...till I found the head.

205
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,460
I told himnot to touch anything,
but he never listens.

206
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,990
God,patty,you're such a bitch.

207
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,110
Did you guys see anythingout of the ordinary
fore you foundthe body?

208
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,230
There were some brokenornaments by the tree.

209
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,620
Who could do something like
thisso close to christmas?

210
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,340
The grinch.

211
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,520
Oh,you're a fuckingriot,max!

212
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,040
Like anyone's gonna go shoppingdown
here after this. There go our jobs.

213
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,410
Thank you foryour cooperation.

214
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,150
Oh,sucks to be an elf.

215
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,430
Get some visual surveillance.

216
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,620
I got here as fast as I
could.What are we looking at?

217
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,600
Female victimcut up into pieces.

218
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,440
The ice-truck killer?So soon?

219
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,840
Yep,and after the bloodbathat the hotel,

220
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,590
can't wait to seehow the captain's
gonna handle the presson this one.

221
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,030
James,I need you to walk
dexterto the crime scene.

222
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,770
And will somebody turn
offthis goddamn snow machine?!

223
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,530
Your sistercan help you out.

224
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,660
That a whole sexual-tensionthing
or am I missing something?

225
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,810
103.

226
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,460
It's the same numbershe
left at marina view hotel.

227
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,380
Any leadsas to what they mean?

228
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,550
We've talked to
numerologists,mathematicians,

229
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,920
code breakers -- nothing.They
need more to go on.

230
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:13,340
First he turns my whole world
inside out with a carnival of blood.

231
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,080
Now he leaves
me this --

232
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,600
a calming oasis in the
desert of my confusion.

233
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,480
It doesn't make sense.

234
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,820
Crime scene's wiped clean.

235
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,890
Another hooker?

236
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,850
Ho,ho,ho
--another dead ho.

237
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,500
Somebody's been naughty.

238
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,350
Hey,morgan,want to siton my lap when we're
done and tell me what you wantfor christmas?

239
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,110
And he's back.
No,thanks.

240
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,170
Last thing on my wish list isa
burning sensation when I pee.

241
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,320
This doesn't seem right.

242
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:56,500
Body parts scatteredamong the presents.
Broken ornaments.

243
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,490
It's not his usualmeticulous style.

244
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,010
It seems rushed...

245
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,050
haphazard.

246
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,930
That would explain why we
can'tfind one of the hands.

247
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,020
What's wrong?

248
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,080
There's somethingunderneath the torso.

249
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,060
Merry christmas,miami.

250
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,680
After all this time, why do you think
the ice-truckkiller has struck again?

251
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,990
Any answer at this time would
bepure speculation on my part.

252
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,170
Do you thinkit has any connection with your
department's handlingof the neil perry fiasco?

253
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,920
Sir?

254
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,110
You've arrested the wrong man.

255
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,840
May the world think I'm a rank amateur,

256
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,490
and I'm very,very angry to
answer for your mistakes.

257
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,230
Stop the tape.

258
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,430
What are you doing?

259
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,800
Look at her tears.They're rolling up.

260
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,350
Oh,my god.

261
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,000
Bastard's got herupside down.

262
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,440
That's how he bleeds them out.
He strings them up like meat. It was me.

263
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,790
No,please,no --

264
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,310
All right,turn it off.

265
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,730
I'll have the tape sentto
the station for analysis.

266
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,550
Sergeant doakes,you're on point.

267
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,830
With all due respect,sir, lieutenant
laguerta's in chargeof this investigation.

268
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,940
Not anymore.

269
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,850
The fact is we haven't
been ableto catch this guy,

270
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,000
and now he's rubbingour noses in it.

271
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,300
We've got to come upwith some fresh ideas.

272
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,870
This is some bullshit.I'll go talk to him.

273
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,050
No,no,no.Do as he says.

274
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,100
The commissioner has his assin a sling.

275
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,720
He's up for review.Word
is he's getting the boot.

276
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,760
So you're just gonna sit backand take this?

277
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,700
Well,if it means being
seenas his worthy successor...

278
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,880
I'll be at the hospital.

279
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,930
All right,P.B. And J. Inside,
cut diagonally,not straight across.

280
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,720
Tastes better that way.

281
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,530
Has dad said if he's coming
overchristmas eve or christmas morning?

282
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,850
I miss him.

283
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,550
Well,I'm -- I'm afraidyour dad's not
gonna make it this year for the holidays.

284
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,000
Where is he?

285
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,920
Well,uh...he's --

286
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,060
he's back in jail,isn't he?

287
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,550
Look,I know he wantedto say goodbye,
but there wasn't any time.

288
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,760
He loves you guys so much.

289
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,290
I forgot my math book.

290
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,720
I'm -- I'm sure he'd loveto hear
from you. We could write him a letter.

291
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,630
It's all your fault.

292
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,970
You could at least
pretendyou want to be here.

293
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,140
You're the one who hadthe
urgent need for tacos.

294
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,050
Yeah,so we could talkabout rudy.

295
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,380
He's been actingweird lately.

296
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,150
Last nighthe said we need to talk.

297
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,630
Well,that's never good.

298
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,950
Well,thanks.I feel a lot better.
I've only been obsessingabout this all day.

299
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,110
Think you could talk to himfor me?

300
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,990
Oh,look,it's rudy.

301
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,520
I sort of called him.

302
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,900
Dex,deb didn't tell meyou'd be joining us.

303
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,070
Apparently she's hada lot on her mind.

304
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,010
Oh,shit.

305
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,320
That's work.I have to go.

306
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,640
Here,take mine.Sorry.

307
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,400
What's with your lip?
Deb catch youwith a right hook?

308
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,220
She can be pretty protectivewith the remote.

309
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,430
I had a little workshop
accidentthis morning.

310
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,280
Doesn't look like it happenedthis morning.
The cut's already closing up.

311
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,790
Oh,did I sa--I meant yesterday
morning. I think I'm workingtoo hard.

312
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,300
Anyway,I don't think my lip
is why deb arrangedthis little chitchat.

313
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,910
My sister is afraid there
may betrouble in paradise.

314
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,090
Your sister's wrong.

315
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,720
So this whole"need to talk" thing?

316
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,220
I'm starting to look atthe big picture.

317
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,030
She's someonethat I could see
spending the restof my life with,you know?

318
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,120
No,I don't know.

319
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,820
But I do know that
deb'sfalling for you...hard.

320
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,340
- You hurt her...
- and you'll hurt me.

321
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,080
Something like that.

322
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,740
Angel,se recupera.

323
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,410
Angel va a estar en la
casa para la navidad.

324
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,770
Okay? El es un hombre fuerte y strong.

325
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,930
Y adem*S...

326
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,970
I'm tired of hearingyou two gallinas cluck.

327
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,900
Hey,you.

328
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,070
You had us so worried.

329
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,540
If I'd have known that this would
get you backin the same room with me,

330
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,930
I would havegotten stabbed sooner.

331
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,820
I'm gonna get the doctor.

332
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,940
No,no,no.What are you doing? No,dejalo.

333
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,090
The doctor said you're
lucky to be alive andstill have a liver.

334
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,980
Well,that's why I got two,right?

335
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,200
It's a good thingyou decided to be a cop.

336
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:27,040
Tell me that you caughtthe cocksucker
that ruinedone of my best shirts.

337
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,650
We don't have any
leads.Did you see anything?

338
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,930
No.

339
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,630
He was behind me.

340
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,020
I just felt the blade go in.

341
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,330
It happened so fast.

342
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,510
Maria...

343
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,830
how long has nina been here?

344
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,620
She was the first oneat the hospital.

345
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,110
She's been with youthe whole time.
Yo no s¨¦ porque,pero...

346
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,250
My mother was murdered before my eyes.

347
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,820
Makes sense I'd choose a life
where I search for meaning in blood.

348
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,960
The sole memory I have of
her is being covered in it.

349
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,030
I need to know more details.

350
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,300
I hope that look means you
foundsomething on batista's shirt.

351
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,970
You should see this.

352
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,700
That's what I drove all the
wayback from the hospital for?

353
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,160
This drop of blood doesn'tmatch the wound pattern
or the spatter from the restof batista's shirt,

354
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,620
and look where it is -- onthe
inside of the back collar.

355
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,760
You thinkit's the attacker's blood?

356
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,490
We knowbatista fought back.

357
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,940
Well,run the dna.

358
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,620
If this guy's got priors,we'll
get a hit on the database.

359
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,150
Already sent a sampleto the lab.

360
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,800
Sorry to hear,you know,
about matthews taking youoff the case.

361
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,560
Last gaspof a desperate man.

362
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,540
Things are gonna changearound here.

363
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,480
And I won't forgetyour help.

364
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,360
And I'm very,very angry.

365
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,630
Oh,god,no! No,please!

366
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,890
I can't watch this again.

367
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,200
I know it's tough,but just
keepyour eyes on the monitor.

368
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,050
Wait -- what
was that?

369
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,210
The camera tilts up
right before he hitsthe off switch.

370
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,200
Watch.

371
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,610
That,my friends,is a
monsterrefrigeration unit.

372
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,230
He needs it coldto preserve the bodies.

373
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,280
But check this out.

374
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,930
Look how much space there is
between her feetand the ceiling.

375
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,780
This room is bigger than
yourstandard commercial freezer.

376
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,310
Most likelyit was a custom build.

377
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,770
So we should focus our
searchon commercial districts.

378
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,890
No. Residential.

379
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,780
You think he built thisin his own place?

380
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,110
He picks up hookers,right?I worked vice.

381
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:07,340
The smart girls know not to gonear a factory or
a warehouse unless you neverwant to be seen again.

382
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,350
How do we know he didn'tknock
out his victims or drug them,

383
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,820
then take themback to a warehouse?

384
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,000
None of the other victimsshowed any signs
of head injury or narcotics.

385
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,660
Besides,what better wayto trap a victim
than to get her to walkinto your own home?

386
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:24,000
The escort service saidshe was meeting her client
at the corner of brickell avenueand coral way.

387
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,940
And her body was foundat santa's cottage,
which is on biscayne mall.

388
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,420
We'll map out grids.

389
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,560
We'll focus onprivate residences drawing
large amounts of powernear those areas.

390
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,270
Catch a break...

391
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,290
we'll catchthis son of a bitch.

392
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,480
Where the hellare you going?

393
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,290
I need to do some researchon a case.

394
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:45,190
You were supposed to call meafter your
lunch with rudy. I've been freaking out.

395
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,870
He sent me this text message.

396
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,710
"Cum sail away with me?"
He misspelled "come."

397
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:54,530
Dexter,this is no time to joke.
This is good,right?A romantic weekend?

398
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,590
What did he say to you?

399
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,770
Oh,wait,no.Don'T.
Don't tell me.

400
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,770
Maybe he wants itto be a surprise.

401
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,990
Unless I should know.Should I know?

402
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,820
Okay,tell me.
You know,no.Don'T.

403
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,700
"We need to talk"?
Who says that unlessyou're getting dumped?

404
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,210
I don't thinkthat's what this is about.

405
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,550
He probably wants me out on
thewater in case I make a scene.

406
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:17,550
You know,I always do this.I put myself
out there. I set myself up to get hurt.

407
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,270
He wants to bepart of the family.

408
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,570
What?

409
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,820
Wait.
Like...propose?

410
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,660
I have to get to the librarybefore it
closes, but we'll talkabout this later,okay?

411
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,690
Oh,my god.

412
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,300
Oh,my god!

413
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,600
I was never one to dwell on my past,
always content to leave it a mystery.

414
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,110
No details -- just a
blur of images rushing by.

415
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,980
But my friend out there
wants to bring those memories into focus.

416
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,180
So do I.

417
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,490
This is it for the metro
newsfor 1972 through 1973.

418
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,450
The tribune's archives...

419
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,660
SHIPPING YARD MASSACH

420
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,940
10/3?

421
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,720
1-0-3 -- same as the
hotel,same as santa's cottage.

422
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,790
This is what he wanted me to find all along.

423
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,910
SMALL TIME CRIMINALS VICTITM OF MASSACRE

424
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,680
Dexter,close your eyes.

425
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,510
Don't look.

426
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,060
Laura moser...

427
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,600
my mother.

428
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,270
No wonder I felt so
disconnected my entire life.

429
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,340
If I did have emotions,I'd have to feel...

430
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,560
this.

431
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,780
October 3,1973.

432
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,590
Laura moserand three others
found chopped upwith a chain saw.

433
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,390
Apparently a drug dealerdidn't appreciate
laura and her friendsstealing his cocaine.

434
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,060
First officer on scenewas harry morgan.

435
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,070
You've been busy.

436
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:29,130
A crime that big and yet there's no
record ofthe case file at city hall.

437
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,210
That seems a bit odd.

438
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,530
It's a long time ago.

439
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,410
What is in that report
thatharry didn't want me to see?!

440
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,550
Why was there no mentionin any of the newspapers
about a 3-year-old boyat the crime scene?!

441
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,370
Camilla...

442
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,350
damn it,I need to know.I need that file.

443
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,950
I can't give you the
file'cause it no longer exists.

444
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,440
I destroyed it the dayyour
adoption went through.

445
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,420
You did what?

446
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,890
Made a promiseto your father.

447
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,540
Why,to protect him?

448
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,840
To protect you.

449
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,980
Harry had a code.
He'd never ask youto destroy evidence.

450
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,780
Your father was a decent
manand an honest cop,

451
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,980
but what he saw in thatcargo
container changed him.

452
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,760
You were left there for days,starving,

453
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,900
in blood 2 inches thick.

454
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,570
- Yeah.
- Dex,cody's run away!

455
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,380
- Are you sure?
- Yeah,I've looked everywhere.

456
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,160
Well,call the police.I'll be right there.

457
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,690
Camilla...

458
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,680
I need to know the truth.

459
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,060
Kid...

460
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,460
leave this one alone.

461
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,430
I-I-I can't sit herelike this.
I should be out theredoing something.

462
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,840
Rita,the police saidyou need to stay here
in case cody comes home.

463
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,350
The neighbors are helping.We'll find him.

464
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:10,200
Yeah,but one squad carfor all of miami?

465
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,010
What if some crazy personpicked
him up off the street?

466
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,630
It's all my fault.

467
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,740
Honey,what are youtalking about?

468
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,640
I should have heard codyget out of bed.

469
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,980
I'm his big sister.

470
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,740
Hey.Hey,look at me.

471
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,580
It's not your fault,okay?

472
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,690
Okay?

473
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,030
Could you go get dextersome water?

474
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,110
I should haveseen this coming.

475
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,980
Cody was so upset with me
when I told him that paulwas back in jail.

476
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,450
Paul.

477
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,760
- Today's thursday,right?
- Yeah.

478
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,940
I think I knowwhere cody might be.

479
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,340
Hey.

480
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,840
Need a push?

481
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,670
Today's the day you meet daddyin the park,huh?

482
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,230
He'll be here.

483
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,400
Oh,baby,I'm so sorry,but he's not coming back --

484
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,360
not for a long time.

485
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,480
Look,we'll talk about thiswhen we get home,okay?

486
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,760
After all the lies harry left for me to uncover,
I'd love to run away,too.

487
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,790
He won't even look at me.

488
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,710
I'm not the one in jail,and yet I'm still the bad guy.

489
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:50,970
Well,you didn't tell themthe truth...
about their father.

490
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,810
I told thempaul was back in jail.

491
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,520
Well,right,you told them where he is,
but you didn't tell them o he is.

492
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,330
He's stillthe same drug-using,
wife-beating redneckhe always was.

493
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,560
They should hear that.

494
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,010
You're not a parent.You don't understand.

495
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,700
You do anythingto protect your kids.

496
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,860
Rita,wake up.You're not protecting them.
You're protecting paul.

497
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,360
Well,I --I got to get them home.

498
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,610
Somebody'sin a good mood.

499
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,390
The commissionerand the review board
did not look happythis morning.

500
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,060
They've been in matthews' officefor two hours.

501
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,350
You thinking his ass is aboutthree shades of red right now?

502
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,730
I don't carewhat color it is
as long as it's on its wayout the door.

503
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,470
Tell me that did notjust happen.

504
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,740
It's who you knowand who you blow.

505
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,560
Probably pickingtheir fucking tee time.

506
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,510
Maria,watch your back.
He's gonna be gunning foyounow more than ever.

507
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,450
Let him try.

508
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,810
My man juan,hook it up.

509
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,270
They didn't have road and track so...

510
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,110
that better bea bag of applesauce.

511
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,920
Okay,juan,at this point,you should go save yourself.
Go.

512
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,720
Oh,you got to bekidding me.

513
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,410
Two double-meats?

514
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,050
A man's got to eat.

515
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,940
You're so cutewhen you're annoyed.
You know,your mouth makesthose little o'S.

516
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,350
God damn it,angel,
do I look like I'm beingfucking cute with you?

517
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,040
Well,not now you don't,no.

518
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,960
Why do you always do this --

519
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,070
make light of thingsthat matter?

520
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:54,060
Okay,I'm sorry.Okay?

521
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,470
When I come home,I'll eat anything you want.

522
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,130
No jokes,no
complaining --I promise.

523
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,560
When you come home?

524
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,570
I thought the way thingsare going with us...

525
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,670
I thoughtyou'd forgiven me.

526
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,150
Well,of courseI forgive you.

527
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,620
I forgave youa long time ago.

528
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,680
Okay,so let's fix this.

529
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,090
This could bea second chance for us.

530
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,170
What?

531
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,870
Look,you did what you did.

532
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,300
It was hard.

533
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,310
But it got usto face the truth.

534
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,060
We were miserable...for years.

535
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,550
Do you reallywant to survive this

536
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,690
and go right backto being unhappy?

537
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,170
Maybe.

538
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,610
What if I do?

539
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,640
Look,you will always bejorge's father.

540
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,590
I will alwayscare about you.

541
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,450
I'll always be herefor you.

542
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,620
But our marriage is over.

543
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,180
Why,yes,by all means,tom,please,come in.

544
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,700
Maria...let's you and me have a talk.

545
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,040
Congratulations on the
review.I hear it went well.

546
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,280
You must be thrilled.But
now,if you don't mind --

547
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,200
let me getright to the point.

548
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,540
All our mishapsthese
last few months --

549
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,000
failure to bringin the ice-truck killer,

550
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,400
mishandling of tony tucci...

551
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:50,710
even neil perry --

552
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:54,370
neil perry was your fuck-up...not mine.

553
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,910
They're all the resultof
a bad command structure,

554
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,270
and that's my failure.

555
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,020
Well...

556
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,320
I'm glad to hear yousay that.

557
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,030
Takes a big man to admithis own mistakes.

558
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,840
So this morning,

559
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,320
the commissionergave me the
go-ahead to restructure the division.

560
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,210
Effective immediately,
you will no longer serveas my lieutenant.

561
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,810
I'm sorry.
I know this must be difficultfor you.

562
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,550
Please,it's ridiculous.

563
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,980
You reallydon't want to do this.

564
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,580
Because of your statusin
the cuban community.

565
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,030
I'm a fucking heroto this community.
You think they're just gonnaaccept it?

566
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,280
Your replacement has alreadybeen selected.

567
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,830
Her name is esm¨¦ pascal,atransfer from
fort lauderdale -- a real up-and-comer.

568
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,810
Pascal,the haitian-american?

569
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,540
The one who got shot last
yearin the line of duty.

570
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,830
Mm-hmm.Turns out she's an actual hero.

571
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,820
You think I'm gonnastay quiet for this,
you're out of your mind.

572
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,180
I did warn you,maria.

573
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,340
I'm gonna need you to clear
outthis office tonight.

574
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,120
Expect a callfrom my union rep.

575
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,110
You'll always have a
placein the bullpen --

576
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,770
and my fucking lawyer,too!

577
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:15,990
- ...With all the otherdetectives.
- This isn't fucking over,tom!

578
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,890
You goddamn...
Son of a bitch!

579
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,500
Oh,you got to bekidding me.

580
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,020
How are you?

581
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,550
How the hell do I look?

582
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:37,200
I can barely rememberhow I got here.

583
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,260
Look,there's somethingwe need to discuss.

584
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,020
If you came for an apology,you
wasted a tank of gas.

585
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,590
Sit.I'm not finished.

586
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,190
Fuck you.

587
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,790
Astor and codyare in the other room.

588
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,080
Jesus,you brought them here?

589
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,090
Look,I knowthis will be difficult, but I need
you to explain tothem why you're in this place.

590
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,160
I have no fucking ideawhy I'm in this place.

591
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,120
Fine. Fine.
You want to be in denial?Go ahead.

592
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,450
You will never seeyour kids again.

593
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,300
Wait,wait,wait,wait.Rita,wait,wait.

594
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,580
I fought so hardto win those kids back,

595
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,920
especially astor. If they see me here
like this,I'm gonnlose them forever.

596
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,430
Paul,the one good thingthat came
out of our marriage are those kids.

597
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,170
And I know you love them.

598
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,760
But if you want to have
any kind of realrelationship with them,

599
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,600
it has to bewith the father they have,

600
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,240
not the fatherthey wish they had.

601
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,380
Now,you cheated on me.

602
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,760
You broke my heart,you broke my bones,

603
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,070
and I took it so those kidswouldn't have to.

604
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,130
But I am giving you the
chanceto make it all right.

605
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:53,060
Not for me,but for them.

606
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,840
I-I-I...I wouldn't
knowwhat to say.

607
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,170
Tell them you're payingfor your mistakes.

608
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,450
It's a valuable lesson.

609
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,870
It's one you never got.

610
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,040
So what's it gonna be?

611
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,610
Okay.

612
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,960
Daddy!Daddy,daddy!

613
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,210
Hey!

614
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,050
All right,this won't take long.

615
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,120
There was a drop of blood
on the back of your shirtthat wasn't yours,

616
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,380
so I need to checkthe back of your head.

617
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,480
Just so longas it's only my head
you're checkingback there,bro.

618
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,990
How are thingswith you and rita?

619
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:58,360
Not so good,actually.We kind of...had words.

620
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,000
I think I really upset her.

621
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
Oh,that's rough,man.

622
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,210
Maybe I'm notthe right person for her.
Some people are meant to bealone,right?

623
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:09,160
Dex,socio,alone sucks.

624
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,710
- Ihijo de puta!
- Sorry.

625
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,520
These are teeth marks.

626
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,910
- You definitelywounded this guy.
- Good.

627
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,760
I hope I brokehis fucking nose...

628
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,080
or at least gave hima fat lip.

629
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,410
Angel,have you ever metdeb's
boyfriend,rudy cooper?

630
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:32,860
Yeah. I went by his
officea couple of days ago.

631
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,340
Nice guy. Why?

632
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,910
At lunch,rudy said he'd
hurt his lip that morning.

633
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,930
He was lying,and I was
too distracted to care.

634
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,470
But he's got my full attention now.

635
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,790
Hey,you here tonight?

636
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:03,080
Yeah,we're tits-deepin the ice-truck killer. Might
be onto something.It's gonna be an all-nighter.

637
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,650
So that text messageyou got from rudy about
going away wh him --you're not gonna do that?

638
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,410
Tragically,no.

639
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,670
I was all psyched to meet
himat the miami beach marina,

640
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,920
but this bullpen's my
hometill we finish this.

641
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
Good.

642
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,820
I'm working on a theorythat
rudy was gonna propose,

643
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,450
and now he can't --why is that good?

644
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,630
No,I meant good thatyou're
making progress here.

645
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,410
Yeah.We're getting closer.

646
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,550
Fingers crossed.

647
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,770
At least I know my sister is safe tonight,

648
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,830
which gives me time to check
out my own theory on rudy.

649
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,920
We've defined the areafor
the residential search.

650
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,830
Good. So we'll startcanvassing
tonight. You take the --

651
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,480
That him?

652
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:46,720
Yeah,how'd you know?

653
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,320
'Cause you got that
stupid-assgrin on your face again.

654
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,870
Go ahead.
Answer it.

655
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,510
Hey.

656
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,760
Hey,supercop,what's the word?

657
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,510
I'm kind of in a thingright now.

658
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:03,720
Got it. I'll be quick.You
never answered my text.

659
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,190
Do I have the pleasureof
your company this weekend?

660
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,280
Uh,yeah,about
that --

661
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,110
come on,deb,it's only two days.

662
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:14,060
I know,I know. It's just we've hada
major break in the ice-truck-killer case.

663
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,920
I promise,as soon as we catchthis douchebag,

664
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,420
you and I are gonna spenda
whole week together in bed.

665
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,700
You are not gonna be ableto get rid of me.

666
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:25,920
Okay,okay,but how about dinner?

667
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,940
Oh,my god,you are persistent.

668
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:32,390
Well,you got to eat,right?
So why noteat dinner with me...

669
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,020
on this yacht I'm on?

670
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,420
Where the helldid you get a yacht?

671
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,200
I rented it.

672
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,510
I thought we'd havea
nice couple days together,

673
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:43,050
but we could still havea nice night.

674
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:46,080
And there is that thingwe
need to talk about.

675
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:50,360
okay,well,maybe I can
takean hour for dinner.

676
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,880
I can work with an hour.

677
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,790
I mean,a real hour,not one of your
"let's stretch this outtill 2:00 A.M.

678
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,890
You might as well stayand have sex" hours.

679
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,790
Right. Real hour.

680
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,640
No fakey hour.Got it.

681
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,820
All right,I'll get out
of hereas fast as I can.

682
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,600
I'll see you soon.

683
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,250
Thinking rudy attacked batista doesn't
make any sense. He's a loving boyfriend.

684
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,840
He spends his life helping people in need.

685
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,140
He brought me steaks.

686
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,150
Well,that's just rude.

687
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:31,650
Why would loving and helpful rudy
need an industrial-grade lock...

688
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,120
and a security camera?

689
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,730
How do I get his dna now?

690
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:02,550
At times like this, I wish the truth
was more easily accessible,unless --

691
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:04,870
right.

692
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,550
But harry taught me to trust my gut.

693
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,530
"People lie all the time," he said.

694
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,530
"But your instinct will never fail you."

695
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:19,420
Some blood from a cut lip,perhaps?

696
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,400
Fuck me!

697
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,970
I believe your rule
specificallyprohibits such action.

698
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,350
Did you do all this?

699
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:43,790
In fact,I did.

700
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:45,970
You like?

701
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,020
I like.

702
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,750
I like so much that it makes what
I haveto tell you that much harder.

703
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,310
Oh,please tell meyou're not leaving.

704
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:56,370
I'm sorry. I hit traffic.
It took me 30 minutesto get here.

705
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,430
I have to turn aroundand go right back.

706
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,410
Oh,my god.
Hold on. Hold on.Wait.

707
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,330
Well,you're sort offorcing my hand here.

708
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,830
I wanted to wait until we
wereout in the water,but...

709
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,700
Here goes.

710
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,030
I know this seems fast...

711
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:16,330
but I
feel --

712
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:19,330
I feel that I waited my
wholeentire life for you.

713
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,040
And now that you're here,

714
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,260
I don't want you to leave.

715
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,300
Debra morgan...

716
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,190
will you marry me?

717
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,010
I knew it!I fucking knew it!

718
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:34,480
Is that your versionof a "yes"?

719
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,910
Yes,yes,yes,yes,but
--

720
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:39,530
no,no,no!Stop at "yes."
Yes,I like that part.

721
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:42,930
Yes,but let's slow it down,you know?

722
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:46,310
Like,let me savor this.I
want to be with you.

723
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,860
I want to enjoy it,you
know? So it's a "yes," but --

724
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,000
okay,I get it.You do?

725
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,630
No,not really,but I can work with it.

726
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:55,930
Good,good.

727
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,480
Oh,god,I can still wearthe ring,right?

728
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,140
Yes,but...there's a condition.

729
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,920
I know you have togo to work,but...

730
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,660
if you're gonna wear the
ring,we need to celebrate.

731
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:10,890
One glass of champagne
--that's all I ask.

732
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:12,340
- Rudy,I --
- I mean it.

733
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,360
You can't leave yoursort-of
fianc¨¦ on a yacht with a cold meal

734
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,930
and an unopenedbottle of champagne.
It's kind of cruel.

735
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:22,330
Just one glass of champagne...to celebrate.

736
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,410
And then you can go back,
saving miamifrom the ice-truck killer.

737
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,270
I can live with that.

738
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:38,480
Hey,I need these twotested against
each other. It's kind of a rush.

739
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,880
Excuse me,hi.

740
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,010
Hey,these two -- tested
againsteach other right now.

741
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,570
Okay.

742
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:55,790
It's deb. Do it.

743
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,610
Hey,I know you're working,
but let me knowwhen you come up for air.

744
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,680
I need to talk to you.I'm in the building.

745
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:10,420
This yacht's amazing.

746
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,740
I didn't know you wentfor stuff like this.

747
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,040
Well,you have a whole lotto learn about me.

748
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,150
Was that justthe phone ringing?

749
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:21,410
Yeah -- big brother.I let it go to voice
mail. He can waittill we're done here.

750
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:24,060
Good.I want you all to myself.

751
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,170
So...let the toasting begin.

752
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,770
To...what comes next.

753
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:41,020
You're not drinking.

754
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:48,930
Tastes like menthol,

755
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:51,580
which,it turns out,is not that sexy.

756
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:00,070
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

757
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,150
Just bad memories.

758
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,940
Oh.That's right.
That was the --

759
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,910
the one clue the ice-truckkiller
left behind,right?

760
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,090
Right.

761
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,470
Wait.How did you know that?

762
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,230
I don't often make mistakes,

763
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,940
but when I do,they haunt me.

764
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:27,910
Hilarious.

765
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,400
Your champagne'sgonna get warm.

766
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,490
You know the one thingI've
been dying to ask you?

767
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:37,450
How did you not knowwho I was?

768
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,680
You're a cop.

769
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,250
This isn't funny.

770
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:48,250
I thinka real cop would,um,

771
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:53,080
at least have a sensethat she was in the
presence of the personshe was hunting,right?

772
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,930
You're hurting me.

773
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:59,930
I'm didn't show youthe best part of my loft.
Built it myself.

774
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,180
Stop it!

775
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,160
The refrigerated room.

776
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,790
Oh,god,why are you doing this?!

777
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:11,070
You know,the tricky partwas
getting you on the boat.

778
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:13,660
The other womenI could just pay.

779
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:18,120
But at the end...you made it easy.

780
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,190
So desperateto fall in love.

781
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,280
Stop.

782
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,970
Dude,you got to see this.

783
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,700
The autopsy on oursanta's cottage victim?
Check it out.

784
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:52,460
One arm was shorterthan the other.
So that got me thinking.

785
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,870
I mean,our guy isn't sloppy.He's precise.

786
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:57,320
Not now,vince.

787
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,390
Dude,her left wrist was2
inches shorter than her right.

788
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:04,320
I mean,why cut off moreon
the left side than the right?

789
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,900
Because our girl...

790
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,100
our girl wasa fucking amputee.

791
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:13,330
I looked upher medical records.

792
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:16,370
She had a fake left hand.
That's whywe couldn't find it.

793
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:19,610
The killer cut offthat extra piece of wrist
so that we wouldn't seethe stump.

794
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,080
Let me see that.

795
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,240
That nightbatista was stabbed,

796
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,730
he was following upon a lead he got
from a one-handed call girl.

797
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,740
Guess whatthe lead was about.

798
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,890
The ice-truck killer.

799
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,920
Booyah.

800
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,440
You sure?

801
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,130
Positive. The samplesyou gave me were
a match. They're from the se person.

802
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,270
Hey,you all right?

803
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:58,060
Where's my sister?

804
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,450
Took her code 12.Left about an hour ago.

805
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,340
She wasn't supposedto go anywhere.

806
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:08,340
Dispatch,this is dexter morgan. I need you
to raise officerdebra morgan on her radio.

807
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,880
Sorry,sir. She's been out of
range for the last half-hour.

808
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,280
It's deb. Do it.

809
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,730
Where the fuck are you? I'm here at
work,and you're not. I need to talk to you.

810
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:27,460
Do not see rudyuntil you find me.

811
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:30,210
