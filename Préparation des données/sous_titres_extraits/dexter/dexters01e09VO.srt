00:01:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
DEXTER 109

4
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,600
Previously on "Dexter"...

5
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,300
What if the ice-truck
killer does disappear?

6
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,000
No, he's got unfinished
business with me.

7
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,800
"Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.

8
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,700
Why the cold shoulder?
Love, Barbie."

9
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,300
Paul called after you left.

10
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,900
He's already out of
jail -- overcrowding.

11
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,400
- Can you believe it?
- Are you fucking my wife?

12
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Next time,
we'll figure out what to tell the kids

13
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,800
so you don't have to
sneak out like this.

14
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,500
You want there to
be a next time?

15
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,000
I just wish he'd go away.

16
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,300
Why can't he just go away
and disappear forever?

17
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,700
- I so want to maul you right now.
- I so want you to.

18
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,900
It's different.
It feels like...

19
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,800
I hate saying this.
It sounds fucking cheesy.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,600
It feels like making love.

21
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,700
"Barbie, be patient.

22
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,400
One day we'll
share a cold one."

23
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,800
Thank god for showers.
Private time to think --

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,300
harder to come by now that
I'm in a real relationship.

25
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,800
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

26
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,000
- Could you pass the soap?
- Yeah.

27
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,800
It's locked!

28
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,100
Mom, I got to pee!

29
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Uh, I'll be right
there, sweetie!

30
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,000
- Hold on a second, buddy!
- I can't!

31
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,100
- Sorry. One-bathroom house.
- Nature calls.

32
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,500
Cool. How did you
get that ugly scar?

33
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,300
Cody.

34
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,300
Sword fight -- I won.

35
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,500
Mom, I got to brush.

36
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,000
Whatever happened to knocking?

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,900
I'm gonna be late for school.

38
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,200
You brush, you pee,
I'm just gonna...

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,200
Wow, big scar.

40
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,500
Sword fight -- he won.

41
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,000
I mean,
what does "separation" mean to you?

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,300
What "separation" means to
me is that you're separated,

43
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,400
and you work it out.???
OK

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,800
Now, this was false pretenses.

45
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,400
I mean,
I knew she wanted a divorce

46
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
when she asked for the separation --
she lied.

47
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,300
Yeah, and you didn't when you
were cheating on her, right?

48
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,300
"Cheat" -- one cheat.
That's in the singular.

49
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,100
One. Okay.

50
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,800
And I felt so crappy,
I told her the next day.

51
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,300
That's your problem.
You're too damn honest.

52
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,800
She wouldn't even
talk about it.

53
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,600
And I tried to get her to
see a counselor with me.

54
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,500
FORGET THAT

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,100
Stop the car, man!
Stop the goddamn car!

56
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,600
Hey!

57
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,400
Stop! Police!

58
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,000
Doakes! Doakes!

59
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,000
- You all right?
- Yeah.

60
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,700
The suspect's name was Jacques Bayard,
according to his driver's license.

61
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,600
- Haitian?
- That'd be my guess.

62
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,000
All right.
Let's go over it again.

63
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,200
I saw a gun in the
suspect's waistband.

64
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,800
I went to question him,
and he took off running WHEN HE SAW ME

65
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,300
Angel, you saw all this.

66
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,900
Yeah, I saw Bayard bolt,

67
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,000
and I turned the car
around in pursuit.

68
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,300
All right,
and when you went under the causeway...

69
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,700
He took a shot at me.

70
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,200
I took cover and returned
fire from that corner.

71
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,600
No, not from there.

72
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,200
Yeah, from fucking right there.

73
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,900
But...

74
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,000
If you shot him
from right there,

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,900
the blood spatter would go in that
direction. Look at the patterns.

76
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,600
You questioning me?
'Cause I got questions for you.

77
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,900
The man's just doing what
he's supposed to do.

78
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,600
- The man is a fucking creep job!
- Just focus on the facts, okay?

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,300
The D.A.'s team is ready for you.
You good?

80
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,600
I'm good.

81
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,400
Yeah. You're up next.

82
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,800
- Sorry, but I didn't invent physics.
- He just got mixed up is all.

83
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,800
Hell, I'm not even sure
what the hell happened.

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,600
Trauma can distort the memory.

85
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,300
Come on. I want you and
Rita to meet my boyfriend.

86
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,500
It's just hard to get a
babysitter on a Friday night.

87
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,600
Dex, you're my brother.
You should know my boyfriend.

88
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,000
You really like using the "B" word,
don't you?

89
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,700
Well, Rudy is my goddamn boyfriend,
so stop making bullshit excuses.

90
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,400
Honestly, our last double
date was a little awkward.

91
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,800
I just want to make sure
this one's gonna stick.

92
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,400
Well, thanks for the vote
of fucking confidence.

93
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,000
Dex, Rudy's different.

94
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,800
I feel safe with him. I think...

95
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm falling for him.

96
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,600
Excuse me.
Where can I find Dexter Morgan?

97
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,800
- Right here.
- Oh, that was easy.

98
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,600
An urgent registered letter?

99
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,600
Maybe you won a sweepstakes.

100
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,900
- Dex, you got a second?
- Yeah.

101
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,700
Hey, you finish your
report on the shooting?

102
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,600
I'm walking it up to I.A.
right now.

103
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,000
You still think Doakes'
version doesn't add up?

104
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,000
Blood never lies.

105
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,800
Shit.

106
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Listen, um... Can you sit on
that till I talk to Doakes?

107
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Here. No, it's yours to sit on,
stand on -- do what you want.

108
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,000
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

109
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,900
You know, it's a federal offense
to read someone else's mail.

110
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,600
"We regret to inform you of
the death of your father"?

111
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,600
Dad died 10 years ago.
This isn't about Harry.

112
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,100
"Joseph Driscoll of Dade City,
Florida, names his son,

113
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,800
Dexter Morgan of Miami,
as his executor."

114
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,300
It's a will.

115
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,000
Well, he can't be your
biological father.

116
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,500
Dad said he died before
you came to live with us.

117
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,300
He wouldn't make a
mistake like that.

118
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,800
"The body's awaiting cremation
while they notify the next of kin."

119
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,000
HEY I'm your only next of kin.
Don't you fucking forget it.

120
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,800
Oh, and I inherited a house.

121
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,100
I know the truth,
because Harry always told me the truth.

122
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,600
He had to.
He was teaching me principles, a code.

123
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,500
He knew what I would
become without it.

124
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,000
So Joseph Driscoll of Dade
City must have been mistaken.

125
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,800
You know what this is?

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,700
This is Dexter's new
birth certificate.

127
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,000
The adoption finally
went through.

128
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,600
You're a Morgan now.

129
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
I thought I was
already a Morgan.

130
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,400
Well, you have been to us,
but it's official now.

131
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,700
It took a long time
and a lot of hurdles.

132
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,100
- This is an important day for us.
- Hey, dad?

133
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,100
How come you never told us what
happened to Dexter's real parents?

134
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,600
- Well, they died.
- I know, but how?

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
- I don't know.
- Let's not talk about it.

136
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,600
No, how did they die, dad?

137
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,800
It was an accident,
a tragic accident.

138
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,800
So, have you found out anything
else about this Joe Driscoll?

139
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,900
Well, I looked online. I even

140
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,000
looked at police records.
There are no birth records,

141
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,800
no driver's license,
just the deed to the house...

142
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,100
And a mention in the local
paper about his bowling team.

143
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,800
That's odd.

144
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,700
Yeah, I spoke to
the probate lawyer,

145
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,800
the guy who drafted the will.

146
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,700
And apparently Joseph Driscoll was
an insurance adjuster of sound mind,

147
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,700
with no doubts about who I was.

148
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,400
Dexter, you're not feeling any of this,
are you?

149
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,400
You're obviously so overwhelmed
that you've shut down.

150
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,900
Maybe.

151
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,500
It's too much for
you to handle.

152
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,700
Yeah. I guess.

153
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,400
So I think I should
come with you.

154
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,800
Oh, no,
you don't have to do that.

155
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,500
Trust me. You'll need me.

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,400
I fell asleep.

157
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,400
Sex like that takes a
lot out of a person.

158
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,700
So, are we still seeing your
brother for dinner Friday night?

159
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,900
Hmm. No.

160
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,800
- He's got to go to Dade City.
- What's in Dade City?

161
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,100
- I told you he was adopted, right?
- Yeah.

162
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,500
Some dead guy up in Dade

163
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
??? Dexter's biological father

164
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,000
and left him a house.

165
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Really?

166
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,900
Wow.

167
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,000
Man.

168
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's a mistake, a big one.

169
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,800
Still, though, that's got to...

170
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,800
open up some old wounds.

171
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,300
When are you leaving?

172
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,800
Me?

173
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,600
I'm gonna stay in bed
with you all weekend.

174
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,300
I thought you two were close.

175
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,900
We are.

176
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,800
Dex just likes to deal
with things on his own.

177
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,300
- He doesn't need my help.
- Or...

178
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,700
He doesn't know
how to ask for it.

179
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,900
I left a message so we wouldn't
have to have this conversation.

180
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Yeah, which is why
I hustled over here,

181
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,700
so we could hash this
out like adults.

182
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,600
Admirable Paul, but this adult
is still going out of town.

183
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,600
Not if it means blowing off my
scheduled visit with my kids.

184
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,300
That's not your call.

185
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,900
The kids are already
settled at Colleen's.

186
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,700
You can have your
visit when we get back.

187
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Uh...

188
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,700
It's just that I already laid
out cash for the tickets.

189
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,100
A death in the family
trumps the circus.

190
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,000
Dexter is not your family.
I am.

191
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,100
You ready?

192
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,800
Hey, Paul. Better hit the road.

193
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,500
Ugh.

194
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,000
They should have served a
cardiologist with these burgers.

195
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,300
We had to eat them.

196
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,500
Junk food's the unwritten
rule of the road.

197
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,900
It's nice.

198
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,500
The lawyer said there should
be a key under the mat.

199
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,900
Are you my new neighbors?!

200
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,300
No.

201
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,200
No, we're just here to clear up
some things with the estate.

202
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,800
So sad about Mr. Driscoll.

203
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,400
He was only 60, you know --
too young for a heart attack.

204
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,800
He used to clean my
gutters every fall.

205
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,300
I don't know what
I'm gonna do now...

206
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,400
Unless you know how
to clean gutters.

207
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,800
Uh, we're not gonna be
here for that long.

208
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,000
But, uh, you have a good day.

209
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,900
A bachelor lived here,
that's for sure.

210
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,200
Well, we can head back
tomorrow morning,

211
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,600
as soon as I straighten
things out at the morgue.

212
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,200
I don't want a
house in Dade City.

213
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,100
Which means it's gonna
need to be packed up.

214
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,200
And I don't think anybody
else is gonna do it, so

215
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,300
I guess that leaves us.

216
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,700
Told you you'd need me.

217
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
- Hey, James.
- Hey, man.

218
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,900
I.A. is pressing me on my
report of the shooting.

219
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,700
Yeah. There's just one thing
that I can't get clear on.

220
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,000
It's pretty clear from
where I was standing.

221
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Yeah... Except I
could have sworn

222
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,800
that I heard your 9-millimeter
go off before the .38.

223
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,600
Now, there's lots of reasons it
could have gone down that way.

224
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,600
If Bayard even
just aimed at you,

225
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,300
it's still all right to shoot.

226
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,000
Except he shot first,
when I came around the corner.

227
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,600
Maybe you're confused
about that too.

228
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,100
BECAUSE The blood-spatter report says it
couldn't have gone down that way.

229
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,200
You saying I'm a liar?

230
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,900
No, I'm saying that maybe
you're not remembering right.

231
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,800
This may come as a fucking
shock to you, Angel,

232
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,100
but you're not the only
honest cop in Miami.

233
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,900
Look, I just want to
know why a man is dead.

234
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,100
You want to come at me,
you come at me straight.

235
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,300
You want it straight?
I did not see a gun.

236
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,100
Angel. I need to talk to you.

237
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,200
Help me out, man.

238
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,200
- Is that Joe?
- Must be.

239
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,500
It's weird,
but he looks a little bit like you...

240
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,800
But not really.

241
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,400
Those seem to be the only
pictures in the house.

242
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,400
There's no family
or kids' photos.

243
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,200
Lonely.

244
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,700
- Dexter. Hi.
- Hey.

245
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,900
Surprise.

246
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I know you can't
ask for my help, but

247
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,300
it's my duty to, you know...

248
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,600
Help while you deal
with old wounds...

249
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,300
Or wha-- Jesus.
Whatever. I'm here.

250
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,900
- So it appears.
- And this is Rudy.

251
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,600
HEY

252
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,200
I've waited a long
time to meet you.

253
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,900
And you must be Rita.

254
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,500
Hi.
HI.

255
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,500
He came here for me --
for the both of us.

256
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,000
Isn't he great?

257
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,500
A lot of work to
pack all this up.

258
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,400
Even with the four of us,
it'll take us the whole weekend.

259
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,000
The whole weekend?
Where should I put our stuff?

260
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,600
It's too eerie,
sleeping in a dead man's house.

261
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,000
I saw a motel 6 on the way in.

262
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,900
We could stay here
and save the money.

263
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,600
I mean, it is late,

264
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,200
and we'd probably get more
packing done if we stayed here.

265
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,600
It's up to you, Dex.
Just say the word.

266
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
As long as you don't
mind the sofa bed.

267
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,600
Okay, I'll go look
for some clean sheets.

268
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,200
How did a death turn
into a couples' weekend?

269
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,300
Luckily, I get up earlier
than normal people.

270
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Coffee?

271
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,300
Thanks. I've got
to hit the morgue.

272
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,700
Want company?

273
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,700
No.

274
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,000
Thank you, though.

275
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
???

276
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,600
I get it.

277
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,000
I gave Joe a physical once a year,
like clockwork,

278
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,900
so no history of heart disease,
but it happens.

279
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,200
It appears so.

280
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,600
We were about to send him to
a crematorium. We thought

281
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,800
his son should have a chance
to pay his last respects.

282
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
I'm not his son.

283
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,900
Estrangement in a
family is a shame, but

284
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,900
death is the great unifier.

285
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,900
Huh. That's an
interesting tattoo.

286
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,700
Joe said he picked
that up in Nam.

287
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,000
You can be proud.
He was a patriot.

288
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,900
Uh, perhaps he was
also an ex-convict.

289
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,100
- Excuse me?
- It's a prison tattoo.

290
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,300
It's done with a pen
and ballpoint ink.

291
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,200
It's three or four decades old,
judging by the fade.

292
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,700
Son, I knew Joe. He was no ex-convict.
He was a good man,

293
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,000
a quiet man,
and a damn good bowler.

294
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
How'd you determine
cardiac arrest?

295
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,000
Was there damage to
the coronary artery?

296
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,600
It's, uh,
professional curiosity.

297
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,500
I work in forensics,
down in Miami.

298
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,200
I see.

299
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,400
Well, uh,
I found microaneurisms in the retinas.

300
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,400
It's common with seizures
during a heart attack.

301
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,000
It's also a sign of
diabetic retinopathy.

302
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,300
Son, I may be a
small-town doctor,

303
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,900
but I know a heart
attack when I see one.

304
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,700
Who knows what caused it --

305
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,100
stress, inactivity...

306
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,600
French fries --

307
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
but knowing won't bring him back.

308
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,200
* I wanna know *

309
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,400
* have you ever
seen the rain? *

310
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,100
* coming down *

311
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,600
It's hard to accept so many unanered
questions, but sometimes...

312
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,300
No, you're right...

313
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,600
Dr. Pittman.

314
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,800
Yeah, this is really hard.

315
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,500
You mind if I just take
a minute alone with...

316
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,700
Dad?

317
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,700
I'll be next door in my office.

318
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,700
- Masuka.
- Hey, it's Dexter Morgan.

319
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,700
Dude, I know your last name.

320
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,700
I need a favor, a DNA comparison.

321
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,000
I thought you were away
with the girlfriend.

322
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,700
What? She surfing
the Crimson wave?

323
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm just helping
out a local agency.

324
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,300
I'm gonna send you
two blood samples.

325
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,700
I need it A.S.A.P.
Do a tox screen, will you?

326
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,900
Hey, Romeo, if this is your
idea of a romantic weekend,

327
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,100
you're gonna be a bachelor
for a very long time.

328
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,900
Yeah.

329
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,200
Run another I.V.
Let's keep his blood levels volumized.

330
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,400
- What's his pressure?
- It's 80 and dropping.

331
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,200
- We may need to do a belly tap.

332
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,400
Hey, Dex. Buddy, I'm here.

333
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,400
- It hurts, dad.
- What happened?

334
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
He tried to climb a fence
to get Debra's ball,

335
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,600
but a dog chased after him,
and he fell on a wrought-iron post.

336
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,900
- Is he gonna be all right?
- We can keep him stable for a while.

337
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,900
But he's gonna need surgery to
repair some internal bleeding,

338
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and that's a problem.

339
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,900
Can we talk over here, please?
Dex, I'll be right back.

340
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,000
Hold your brother's
hand, sweetie.

341
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,700
Okay, the complication is
with your son's blood type.

342
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,500
- I don't want to talk about this.
- Why are you being like this?!

343
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,400
You don't need to mention
that in front of anybody.

344
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,200
Are you crazy?! He could die.
You've got to go now.

345
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,100
So, you heard the .38 go off before
sergeant Doakes' 9-millimeter.

346
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,900
Then I went under the causeway,
and I saw the suspect...

347
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,000
Mr. Bayard...

348
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,300
Mr. Bayard on the ground,
his gun lying next to him.

349
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,100
And you're sure it was Mr.
Bayard's gun?

350
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,200
Well, the .38 wasn't mine.

351
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,300
And Sergeant Doakes had
his niner in his hands.

352
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,200
Did you see Mr. Bayard carrying the
gun before the foot chase began?

353
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,400
Sergeant Doakes did.

354
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,800
Did you see Mr.
Bayard acting suspiciously?

355
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,700
Did you know Mr.
Bayard worked as a janitor?

356
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,900
I --
how the fuck would I know that?

357
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,700
Never got so much
as a parking ticket

358
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,000
since he immigrated from
Haiti 15 years ago.

359
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,700
He got a lot more than that this time,
didn't he?

360
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,500
Are you sure you
heard the .38 go off

361
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,900
before Sergeant
Doakes' 9-millimeter?

362
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,500
Joe bought this house
outright in 1976,

363
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,400
paid cash,
no records before that.

364
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,200
No records,
no childhood photos...

365
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,400
The guy was 60,

366
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
but it's like his life
started when he was 30.

367
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,700
You know, you're right.
He's right.

368
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,400
So, what happened
between years one and 29?

369
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,300
Maybe he butchered
his entire family.

370
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,700
Yeah, or he walked out on his
two wives and a lot of bad debt.

371
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,200
The guy was a loser, after all.

372
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,600
Who else owns this
many bowling balls?

373
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,500
What do you think, Dex?

374
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,700
I think Joe spent
some time in prison,

375
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,500
probably mixed with
some bad people.

376
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,300
Maybe he had to hide from them.

377
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,700
Whatever it was,
drugs were involved --

378
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,700
narcotics anonymous.

379
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,900
Paul used to get these,

380
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,300
except he never made it
past the welcome chip.

381
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,700
- Looks like Joe was clean for...
- Let me guess -- 30 years.

382
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,300
???

383
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,800
BUT???

384
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,400
Nothing in his collection post-1980.
Got to love a purist.

385
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,700
* Whoo *

386
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,200
* slow ride *

387
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,000
Oh, good. Dancing.

388
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,300
* take it easy *

389
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,600
* slow ride *

390
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,300
* take it easy *

391
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,700
* slow ride *

392
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,300
* take it easy *

393
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,700
* I'm in the mood *

394
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
* the rhythm is right *

395
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,500
* move to the music *

396
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,300
* we can roll all night *

397
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,400
* oooh, oooh slow ride *

398
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:36,000
* oooh, oooh slow ride *

399
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,400
- Hello?
- Hey, babe. It's Paul.

400
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,100
Just making sure dear Dexter

401
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,200
is dealing decently
with his dead dad.

402
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,400
We're fine.
Everyone's fine, all right?

403
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,100
- We'll see you on Monday.
- No, no, no.

404
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,300
Talk to me. You having fun?
'Cause I'm not.

405
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,300
- Paul.
- I would have.

406
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,100
I could have taken my
kids to the circus.

407
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,500
We'd be eating
peanuts right now,

408
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,000
stepping in elephant shit.

409
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,500
Paul, this is not helping
my confidence in you.

410
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Oh, I think you've got enough
confidence for both of us.

411
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Look, if you want to work

412
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,600
towards building more visitation days,
not less,

413
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,900
you need to avoid this kind
of behavior right here.

414
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,400
Now, I think you might just
want to politely hang up.

415
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,700
Okay.

416
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,300
You're right.

417
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,400
I'm sorry.

418
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,200
You have a great weekend.

419
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,000
A secret life --
the only thing Joe and I have in common.

420
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,500
There's nothing else in
this house to connect us.

421
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,400
Hiding out?

422
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,200
Cleaning up.

423
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,800
I can only imagine what
you're going through.

424
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,700
- A lot of lemon-fresh joy.
- You joke.

425
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,400
- It's good defense, by the way.
- Thank you, I think.

426
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,700
Still, the possibility has
got to be weighing on you.

427
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,100
- What possibility?

428
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,800
That Joe could actually be your dad.

429
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,900
The only way that's a possibility
is if Harry was wrong.

430
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,100
And, uh,
that's just not possible.

431
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,200
Or he lied.

432
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,400
Don't you worry, little man.
You're not gonna feel a thing.

433
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,400
I thought there was a problem --
you know, the blood?

434
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,900
Your dad fixed it.

435
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,500
See, you have a very special
blood type -- A.B. negative.

436
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,000
It's hard to come by,
and our supply was low.

437
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,300
But your dad knew somebody
with blood just like yours.

438
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,300
You're very lucky.

439
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,100
- Can I have a moment with my son?
- Yeah.

440
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,200
Hey, Dex.
Everything's gonna be fine.

441
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,000
You'll be good as new.

442
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,800
- I will?
- Hey, would I lie to you?

443
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,800
When my father was dying,
he just asked me for one thing --

444
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,200
Debería ser un hombre honesto.

445
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,700
"Be an honest man."

446
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,000
That's all he asked.

447
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,100
I made him that promise,
and that's why I'm a cop.

448
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,300
Now this haitian man is dead,
and I don't know why,

449
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,500
but I know it ain't right.

450
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,300
But if I talk...
I'll be a rat to the whole precinct.

451
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,600
- But if I lie --
- Hold up.

452
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,800
Go ahead.

453
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,800
The blood spatter doesn't
match Doakes' report.

454
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,100
Also...

455
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,900
..I heard Doakes' 9-millimeter
go off before the .38.

456
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,600
- But he must have had good cause.
- So Doakes fired first.

457
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,000
Doakes fired first.

458
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,600
I hope tuna's all right.

459
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,800
Mmm, love me a little mercury.

460
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,300
That's Dexter's.

461
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,000
Oh, he's out stealing garbage-can
space from the neighbors.

462
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,900
Criminal -- I like it.

463
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,700
- Mmm, it's the station.
- Morgan here.

464
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,600
Wait. Did I call the
hot Morgan by mistake?

465
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,000
Freudian. My subconscious
has been exposed.

466
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,500
Well, zip it up and tell
me what's going on.

467
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,800
I got the results.

468
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,700
On Doakes' shooting?
Has he been cleared?

469
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,600
- On the DNA test.
- What DNA test?

470
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,300
You trusted dad your entire life,
so why question him now?

471
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,500
Am I missing something?

472
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,300
- DNA test?

473
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Masuka called?

474
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,700
Your biological father was dead.

475
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,700
Dad told us that. I remember.

476
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,900
So, the DNA came back negative?

477
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,900
It was a match.

478
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,900
Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

479
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,400
Interesting.

480
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,900
Do you think dad...

481
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,700
lied?

482
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,800
I think he might have
known Joe was here...

483
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,900
..five hours up
I-95 my whole life.

484
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,500
Well, he must have had
a damn good reason.

485
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,400
And I'm not gonna let some
guy you didn't even know

486
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,700
- draw him into question.
- Deb, I'm not questioning anything.

487
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,700
That's why you got
a tox screen, too.

488
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,800
I need to clear my head.

489
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,400
Where are your car keys?

490
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,300
Deb, I ordered the
tox screen because

491
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,300
Joe had no history of heart disease
and the coroner's report was inept.

492
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,400
You did it because, for some reason,
he is important to you.

493
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,000
It was professional curiosity.

494
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,500
Then you will be
professionally glad to know

495
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,700
that the only
toxin in his system

496
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,300
was a sedative,
which he probably took to...

497
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
I don't know, sleep.

498
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,100
That would surprise me.

499
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,000
Joe was 30 years sober,

500
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I haven't found anything stronger
than Advil in his medicine cabinet.

501
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,800
It wouldn't be the first time an
addict fell off the wagon, Rita.

502
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,600
Or someone slipped
him the sedative

503
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,200
so he wouldn't struggle when he
was injected with something.

504
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,600
- Like?
- Diabetic insulin.

505
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,200
It can cause cardiac arrest.

506
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,900
We've seen it before.
It's nearly impossible to detect

507
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,300
unless you can find
a point of injection,

508
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,000
which I wasn't looking for,
but if I had a chance --

509
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
???

510
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,400
Jesus Christ!
He's not even your family.

511
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,100
Mom and dad were. I am.

512
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,000
Are you gonna start
questioning me now?

513
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,800
You? Why would I --

514
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,600
Joe Driscoll was obviously
bad fucking news,

515
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,600
which is why dad didn't want
you to know anything about him!

516
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,300
Doesn't that matter to you?!

517
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,900
Uh...

518
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,900
I don't know what
you want from me.

519
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,000
I want what dad wanted.

520
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,800
I want nothing to
do with this guy.

521
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,100
Let's just finish packing up this
crappy house and walk the fuck away!

522
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,800
All right.
That sounds like a good plan. Okay?

523
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,400
I guess I understand
why Deb is upset.

524
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,600
We both idolized Harry,
lived by what he taught us...

525
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,800
Though Deb never had to be taught
not to kill innocent people.

526
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,900
That's why she doesn't
understand why I need to know.

527
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,900
Howdy, neighbor.
Let me get that for you.

528
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,300
Oh. Well, thank you.

529
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I was just wondering did you happen to notice any
visitors over at Joe's last week?

530
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,100
Visitors? Oh, I'm not sure.

531
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,400
I'm just wondering if he
has any outstanding bills --

532
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,300
a gardener, maybe,
or a delivery person, repairman?

533
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,300
Well, come to think of it,
there was a, um,

534
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,100
cable repairman here last week.

535
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,600
He was polite.

536
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,900
But, you know,
he couldn't fix my TV antenna.

537
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,600
You remember what
he looked like?

538
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,900
Oh.

539
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,300
Well, he had dark hair...

540
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,800
Average height --
normal, I suppose.

541
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,900
I did some checking on our
suspect Jacques Bayard.

542
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,400
You lending I.A. a hand?

543
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,200
I just like to know what's
going on in my department.

544
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,500
And what is going on?

545
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,400
Turns out Mr. Bayard changed his
name when he immigrated here.

546
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,900
Used to be Rene Thibault,

547
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,100
a former officer in
the haitian military.

548
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,000
???

549
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,600
Right. "Special" means
you don't talk about it.

550
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,500
But I know you've heard as
many horror stories as I have

551
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,600
about what went on down there
with those death squads.

552
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,300
What were they called?

553
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,400
Tonton macoutes.

554
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,600
Yeah, "the bogeymen."

555
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,900
They did a lot of
terrible things,

556
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,100
killed a lot of people.

557
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,900
They made mothers carry the
heads of their dead sons,

558
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,900
forced fathers to
rape their daughters.

559
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,600
They tied cinder blocks around
people's necks and drowned them

560
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,500
and put mutilated
bodies in trees

561
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,600
and killed anybody who
tried to take them down.

562
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,700
This man, Jacques Bayard,

563
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,600
if he did those things...

564
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,300
He deserved a lot
worse than he got.

565
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,700
Don't worry, James.
It'll be over soon.

566
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,100
I know it will.

567
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,200
If Joe was shot up with insulin,
there will be an injection welt...

568
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,600
Maybe between his
toes or in a freckle.

569
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,700
If it's there, I'll find it.

570
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,700
Small towns.

571
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,400
Come on, Dr. Pittman,
which crematorium did you send Joe to?

572
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,800
Hey! You! stop! Come on!

573
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,400
Get in!

574
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,000
Heard you sneak out.

575
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,100
Took a guess where
you were headed.

576
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,200
Figuring I'd need a ride?

577
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,500
Figured I could talk you out of it.
No such luck, huh?

578
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,400
Deb will be delighted.

579
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,400
As far as I know,
you went out for a walk.

580
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,500
Jesus, Dex,
did you steal something?

581
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,900
Well, my fingerprints
were all over it.

582
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,900
I figured it was prudent to
get rid of the evidence.

583
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,500
It's just a box of ashes.

584
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,600
- Joe was cremated, then.
- Yep.

585
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,300
Guess you weren't able to find out
if he was injected with anything.

586
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,400
No.

587
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,400
- What are you gonna do with him?
- I don't know.

588
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,600
Hmm, dumpster?

589
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,600
I have a better idea.

590
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,500
You know...

591
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,400
No matter what Harry said,

592
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,200
no matter what Deb thinks,

593
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,900
- that's your father.
- Cardboard box.

594
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,800
I know you don't want
to acknowledge it,

595
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,600
which is why you're running around,
breaking and entering,

596
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,600
searching for some killer.

597
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,200
But you took that because there's a
part of you

598
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,100
that knows that this...

599
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,700
That box...

600
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,200
is your real father.

601
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,200
My father.

602
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,900
Sounds strange.

603
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,400
I know.

604
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,000
Oh, hey. You all right?

605
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,100
I was just getting some air.

606
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,700
Oh, hey,
I found something in Joe's closet.

607
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,300
It's just a bunch of papers.
They're over there.

608
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,100
Any clues?

609
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,500
Hey, buddy.

610
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,800
- How you feeling?
- Good.

611
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,000
It kind of itches,
but they have ice cream here.

612
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,000
Life's a trade-off.

613
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,000
- What are you making there?
- A thank-you card.

614
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,700
See? The nurse brought me
the crayons and everything.

615
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,500
Who's it for?

616
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,500
Well, she said I should thank
the man who gave me the blood.

617
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:52,800
I mean, that's normal, right,
giving thank-you cards?

618
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,500
Yes, it is.

619
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,700
It's just that he's gone.

620
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,300
And we won't be
seeing him again.

621
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,800
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

622
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,300
It doesn't really
mean anything.

623
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,600
Yeah, it does.
You keep drawing, son.

624
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,900
I'll make sure it finds him.

625
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,800
Okay.

626
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,800
You had the case dropped?

627
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,300
Excuse me.

628
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,600
I.A. dropped Doakes' case.

629
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,300
Do you seriously think I have
any say over what I.A. does?

630
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,800
I put everything on the line.
I told I.A. the truth,

631
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,500
and there's a lot of
evidence to back that up.

632
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,700
What the hell happened?

633
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,400
Maria, I deserve to know.

634
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,000
All I know is that I.A.
got a call from an agency in Washington.

635
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,900
- What agency?
- I'm guessing military.

636
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,700
They said the case involved some
sensitive foreign-relations issues,

637
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,100
so they were gonna
handle it from there.

638
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,100
They disappeared it.

639
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,700
I always knew Doakes
had a history with them.

640
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,400
I figured special forces,
but this kind of reach --

641
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,900
You think it was
black ops, CIA?

642
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,800
Maybe.

643
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,100
Probably.

644
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,400
And I ratted him out.
Jesus Christ.

645
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,400
Angel...

646
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,800
You did what you
thought was right.

647
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,500
Squeak, squeak.

648
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,800
Do you have a problem?

649
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,900
Officer Benson,

650
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,600
you just bumped
into your superior.

651
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,600
I believe you owe detective
Batista an apology!

652
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,200
Yes, sir.

653
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,400
I'm sorry, sir.

654
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,500
I know I should be sorry that we
met under these circumstances,

655
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,300
but truthfully, I think it was
the best way to get to know you.

656
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,400
Realtor says you
won't get much for it.

657
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,800
Well... more than if I kept it.

658
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,300
Are we good?

659
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,400
We're fine.

660
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,900
All right.
I'll see you back at the station.

661
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,700
Cable repair man. Wait!

662
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,000
Wait! No, no, don't go.

663
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,000
Wait! Please,
I want to ask you something.

664
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,900
Wait!

665
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,600
Alone again.

666
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,200
Finally.

667
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,500
You know what?

668
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,700
I'm glad you were here.

669
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,500
Thought you would be.

670
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,700
Yoo-hoo!

671
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,500
The cable repairman --

672
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,200
Did he say anything
about my TV antenna?!

673
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,500
No!

674
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,500
Rita, it's me.

675
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,400
They're asleep.

676
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,300
Yeah, well,
I should have been here, okay?

677
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,200
It's late and you're drunk

678
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,400
and you can't keep coming
by here unannounced.

679
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,200
You don't call the shots, okay?

680
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,200
- Look, Paul, I want you to leave.
- I don't give a fuck what you want.

681
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,800
- I want my fucking kids!
- You're gonna scare them.

682
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,100
They don't want to see me?

683
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,200
Those kids are gonna remember who
the head of this fucking family is.

684
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,200
Hey!

685
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,800
You're right.

686
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,800
I've been awful.

687
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,000
I just didn't realize I
was hurting you so much.

688
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,300
But I can make it up to you.
Let me try.

689
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,200
Where are you going?

690
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,700
Want to play rough? Huh?
Is that what you want?

691
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,400
No! No!

692
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,300
Fuck you, whore.

693
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,300
Come on. Come on!

694
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,700
Ugh!

695
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,300
Wake up. Wake up. Come on.

696
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,700
I had a father...

697
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,700
Someone other than
Harry who called me son.

698
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,300
The thought never
even occurred to me.

699
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,800
Harry was all I needed.

700
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,900
It was Harry who always
had the answers.

701
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,500
He knew who was good,
bad, safe...

702
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,700
And dangerous.

703
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,800
I built my life on Harry's code.

704
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,100
I lived by it.

705
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,000
But Harry lied.

706
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,200
Why would he do that?

707
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,300
What else don't I know?

708
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,600
My concrete foundation is
turning to shifting sand.

709
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,800
Maybe Rudy was right --

710
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,300
you never can
truly know anyone.

711
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:52,500
