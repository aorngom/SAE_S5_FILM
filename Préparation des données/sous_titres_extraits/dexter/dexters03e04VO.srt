00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:48,099
- <i>Previously on</i> Dexter...
- I'm pregnant.

3
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:50,973
I think I'm gonna be a lousy father.
I don't wanna screw the kid up.

4
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:53,617
Who are we kidding?
You're gonna be a great father.

5
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:56,870
- The Oscar Prado case?
- Freebo killed the A.D.A.'s brother.

6
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:59,976
<i>Except he didn't kill Oscar. I did.</i>

7
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:03,209
I don't know if you officially got
to meet my other brother, Ramon.

8
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:06,366
So you're the guy that Miguel
is always talking about?

9
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:08,206
What do you have on Freebo, Maria?

10
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:10,258
We're working on some new angles.

11
00:02:10,418 --> 00:02:12,463
- Which means you've got shit.
- Excuse us.

12
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,930
Freebo's still out there killing.
We gotta catch him fast.

13
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:17,932
Holy shit, that's my Jane Doe.
Teegan Campbell.

14
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:20,352
I was just telling Miguel
we weren't giving up on Freebo.

15
00:02:20,512 --> 00:02:23,009
Now I have to call him and tell him
that he's probably right.

16
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:25,956
Freebo's probably long gone,
and he didn't kill Teegan.

17
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:28,526
- Looks that way.
- Yuki Amado, internal affairs.

18
00:02:28,686 --> 00:02:31,876
Do you know a Joey Quinn? Be really cool
if you could get next to him.

19
00:02:31,996 --> 00:02:35,032
- You know, do a little recon.
- Yuki, that's not gonna happen.

20
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:37,409
If you light that, I'll arrest you.

21
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:40,207
I told you not to fucking do it!

22
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,707
Why the fuck did you
lock up my c.i.?

23
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:45,710
Why do you  call him your C.I.?
There something you're not telling us?

24
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:48,113
What happened with
the witness I gave you?

25
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:50,506
I thought he had information
that exonerated Chicky Hines.

26
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,801
I reviewed his statement.
It just didn't add up.

27
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:56,512
Anton, I feel not good
about what happened.

28
00:02:56,673 --> 00:02:58,682
I feel not good too.

29
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:01,989
This is the shirt I was wearing
when Freebo met his end.

30
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:05,145
That's his blood right there.
This shirt implicates me in his death.

31
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:09,219
I trust you,
and I want you to trust me.

32
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:11,580
<i>Is it possible
I've actually made a friend,</i>

33
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,840
<i>someone I can trust
with my dark secrets?</i>

34
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,615
<i>Or am I being foolish for even
asking myself these questions?</i>

35
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:29,712
<i>Role playing.</i>

36
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:32,006
<i>It's such an important part
of growing up.</i>

37
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:34,836
<i>When we were kids,
whatever role Deb assigned me...</i>

38
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,304
<i>Evil monster, treacherous nazi,
horrible alien--</i>

39
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,749
<i>I played them to perfection.</i>

40
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:45,979
- We should tell them.
- About the baby?

41
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,846
I don't want them
to hear it from somebody else.

42
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:52,694
Kids.

43
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,700
Dexter and I have something
we want to talk to you about.

44
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,366
- What?
- We're having a baby.

45
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,529
You're gonna have
a new little brother

46
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:07,291
or little sister to play with.

47
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,085
- Which one?
- Which one would you like?

48
00:04:10,246 --> 00:04:12,923
- A puppy.
- You can have a puppy and a baby.

49
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:16,885
But you're not even married.

50
00:04:19,097 --> 00:04:19,930
We're not.

51
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:21,097
Why not?

52
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,974
I... never really thought about it.

53
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,646
You know, I'm gonna grab
the potato salad so I don't forget it.

54
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:30,056
<i>Family man.</i>

55
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:33,516
<i>Husband and father.
Sounds so upstanding.</i>

56
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:35,026
<i>Harmless.</i>

57
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:38,405
<i>Much better than
lives-alone-keeps-to-himself.</i>

58
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,840
Should we?

59
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:44,493
I mean, it's not
the worst idea in the world.

60
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:46,373
- Should we what?
- Get married.

61
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:48,500
Dex.

62
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,133
Yeah, cool.

63
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:51,336
You'd be my dad.

64
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:57,841
Look, this is not something
we're gonna decide today.

65
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,054
Go get your stuff together.
We don't wanna be late for the Prados.

66
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:06,533
Dex.

67
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:09,104
That was ridiculous.

68
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:15,781
<i>The only roles I had trouble
with were good guys--</i>

69
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:18,216
<i>Heroes, knights in shining armor.</i>

70
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:20,197
<i>It just never felt right.</i>

71
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,834
Not now.

72
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:23,659
Miguel, listen to me.

73
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:27,789
You can handle this, Ramon.

74
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:29,536
Okay, let me help you.

75
00:05:29,656 --> 00:05:33,085
Oh, no need. Paper plates
go right into the garbage.

76
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:35,589
- And we'll be back with dessert.
- Thank you.

77
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:38,834
I'm going.

78
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,761
- Please, I really want you to stay.
- Hey, easy.

79
00:05:43,022 --> 00:05:45,390
I mean it, Dexter,
what were you thinking?

80
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,224
Proposing to me like that?

81
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,479
Sorry. With the baby and all,
it just made sense.

82
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:55,442
People don't get married
because it makes sense.

83
00:05:57,165 --> 00:05:58,068
They don't?

84
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:02,281
Would you have asked me
to marry you if I wasn't pregnant?

85
00:06:04,123 --> 00:06:05,076
I don't know.

86
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,305
I married Paul
because I was pregnant.

87
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:12,374
And I won't marry again unless
it's because someone loves me.

88
00:06:14,964 --> 00:06:17,463
I understand why you feel that way.

89
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:19,882
Being a father and being a husband

90
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:22,032
are two very different things.

91
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:24,346
You don't have to be both.

92
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:25,948
I don't want both...

93
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:28,550
unless it's real.

94
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:33,367
<i>Real.</i>

95
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:36,942
<i>How do you show someone real love
when you don't know what it feels like?</i>

96
00:06:40,204 --> 00:06:42,696
Don't leave, Ramon.
It's just another empty lead,

97
00:06:42,857 --> 00:06:45,215
- another worthless tip.
- And I'm gonna keep chasing them

98
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:47,160
until I find the one
that leads to my...

99
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:51,455
- Our brother's killer, okay?
- Stay, Ramon. Come on, for your family.

100
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,999
How about I go for my family?

101
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,513
- Ramon, no.
- I have to go.

102
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:57,933
- Sara.
- I got him.

103
00:06:58,548 --> 00:06:59,464
Ramon.

104
00:06:59,624 --> 00:07:00,627
Come here.

105
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:04,317
Everything all right?

106
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:07,976
He's obsessed.
He's drinking more than usual.

107
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,141
He's not going to stop looking

108
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:13,150
for Oscar's killer
until it takes him all the way down.

109
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:17,149
Grief hits some harder than others.

110
00:07:18,576 --> 00:07:22,445
You know, we could help Ramon find peace
if we told him Oscar's killer was dead.

111
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,407
If we told him, then he'd know.

112
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:29,703
Ramon and I have shared and have kept
each other's secrets all of our lives.

113
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:32,789
- It's not just your secret.
- Which is why I'm asking you.

114
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:35,959
- Miguel, he seems unstable.
- He's troubled.

115
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,295
- He has a temper.
- He's my brother. I can help him.

116
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:40,839
You're it!

117
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,083
You're it!

118
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:45,963
He needs to know
that Freebo's dead.

119
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:52,601
It's a big burden. Not everybody
can handle a secret like that.

120
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:00,980
You're uncomfortable
enough with me knowing.

121
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,147
Trusting my brother is just...

122
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:05,113
It's too much right now.
I get it.

123
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:08,116
- Actually, you do.
- Don't worry about it.

124
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:11,202
Ramon, he'll calm down eventually.

125
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:15,540
<i>Not a chance. This won't go away.</i>

126
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,316
<i>Miguel can't see
what a loose cannon his brother is.</i>

127
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:21,587
<i>He might need some perspective.</i>

128
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:24,049
Astor won't let me play
in the cabin.

129
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:27,262
Don't worry, buddy.
I'll talk to her.

130
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,712
Astor, Carlos wants
to play in the cabin now.

131
00:08:30,832 --> 00:08:31,723
So?

132
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:35,643
- So sharing is one of the rules.
- Whose rule? You're not my father.

133
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:37,773
Astor!

134
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:39,917
Apologize to Dexter.

135
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:49,907
Think she's reacting
to my botched proposal?

136
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:52,493
She's so concerned
about us not being married.

137
00:08:52,654 --> 00:08:55,239
I don't think it's just the marriage.
It's the new baby.

138
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:58,885
She's afraid
she's not gonna be special anymore.

139
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,450
Wow, you're good.

140
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:02,580
I know my daughter.

141
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,370
She just needs some attention,
some reassurance.

142
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:14,223
<i>Astor is auditioning various roles:
wounded child, sullen pre-teen,</i>

143
00:09:14,384 --> 00:09:18,269
<i>oppressed youth...
Finding out who she wants to play.</i>

144
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,479
<i>Dramatic exit stage left.</i>

145
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:25,151
<i>I can't force my way into Rita's life,
any more than I can force Miguel</i>

146
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:27,020
<i>to trust me over his own brother.</i>

147
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,251
<i>I need to take a cue from Astor,</i>

148
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:31,850
<i>get their attention.</i>

149
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:34,033
<i>But first things first.</i>

150
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:36,913
<i>I do have a day job.</i>

151
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:54,754
<i>That's what real love looks like.</i>

152
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:58,217
<i>Well, real love plus loss.</i>

153
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,894
<i>Is that what Rita
needs to see in me?</i>

154
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:02,559
<i>Could be a problem.</i>

155
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,949
That the fiancee?

156
00:10:05,017 --> 00:10:05,900
Not anymore.

157
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:09,216
That's Fiona Kemp.

158
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:12,394
She came to meet the vic for a movie.
She saw the assailant.

159
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:15,113
He knocked her over as he fled.
That's how she got the bum knee.

160
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:17,912
Her description fits the one we've got
of break-ins in the neighborhood.

161
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,415
Same M.O. too.
Back door crowbarred open.

162
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:23,981
We could barely get her
to let go of him.

163
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:29,549
Deb, your butt's buzzing.

164
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:31,008
Christ.

165
00:10:36,247 --> 00:10:38,974
- Quinn here yet?
- Yeah, I just saw him pull up.

166
00:10:42,836 --> 00:10:45,626
Jesus, you should have
beat me here driving this thing.

167
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:48,366
I got stuck on the causeway
behind a stalled car.

168
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:50,750
I know you earn more
with a shield, but come on.

169
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,947
Got a great lease is all.
What do we got?

170
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,594
Jack Rice, 34.
His head's caved in.

171
00:10:56,714 --> 00:10:59,633
Looks like a "b" and "e" gone sideways.
A bunch of priors in the area.

172
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:00,753
Witnesses?

173
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:02,267
Just one.

174
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:06,562
Jack took the day off
to see <i>A Matinee</i> with me.

175
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:09,128
A romantic comedy.

176
00:11:09,913 --> 00:11:13,550
He calls them chick flicks,
but he knows they make me happy, so...

177
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:15,611
I'm sure he was a great guy.

178
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:20,100
But the man you saw fleeing,
he was about six-foot, you said?

179
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,769
And I met Jack at the coffee place
where I work.

180
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,650
When he came in,

181
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,649
something inside of me
just recognized him,

182
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:31,065
even though we'd never met.

183
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:34,072
- Have you ever felt that way before?
- Too many times.

184
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:37,284
We can look at some mug shots.
Maybe describe the man you saw

185
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:38,952
- to a sketch artist.
- A what?

186
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:44,582
- I'm staying with Jack.
- Jack has to go to the morgue.

187
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:49,588
- Forensics is gonna need her clothes.
- Well, why don't you tell her?

188
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:54,733
- You can't take that.
- It's his favorite cap.

189
00:11:56,212 --> 00:11:58,410
Ma'am the cap needs
to come with me.

190
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,468
Sorry, Fiona.

191
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:02,976
We'll give it back to you.

192
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:04,269
You won't.

193
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:09,315
Hey, look at me.
Come on, right here.

194
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:10,983
I'm telling you

195
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:14,403
that I, Joseph Quinn,
will personally make sure

196
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:16,989
that hat comes back to you
unharmed.

197
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:23,333
- He's good.
- Who knew?

198
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:26,447
Is there anything else
you want to keep of Jack's?

199
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,384
Maybe one of his shirts?

200
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:30,606
Come on.

201
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,969
He's like the fucking
witness whisperer.

202
00:12:40,357 --> 00:12:42,348
<i>Maybe he should propose
to Rita for me.</i>

203
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:50,464
Astor, that's so unfair.

204
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,286
You're my little girl,
and you always will be.

205
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,820
You know that, right?

206
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,683
- Rita, you in there?
- Yeah, just one second.

207
00:13:03,728 --> 00:13:05,683
Astor, I asked you a question.

208
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:09,834
Whether Dexter and I get married
is between him and me.

209
00:13:10,378 --> 00:13:12,230
You and I, we have to...

210
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,122
work on being kinder with each other.
Do you think you can help me with that?

211
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,089
Please?

212
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:20,852
Rita, we need you out here.

213
00:13:22,263 --> 00:13:24,050
Look, I've gotta get back to work.

214
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,348
We're gonna talk
about this tonight, okay?

215
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:27,978
All right.

216
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:36,865
We need to switch rooms.

217
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:39,640
We were expecting to watch the sun set
from our honeymoon suite,

218
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,626
because, obviously,
we're on our honeymoon.

219
00:13:42,746 --> 00:13:44,119
But we couldn't see anything.

220
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:45,850
Right, uh...

221
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,187
Well, the sun sets in the west.

222
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:52,002
And Miami is on
the east coast of Florida,

223
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,554
so there's nothing we can...

224
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:56,688
The brochure said,
"watch the sun set over the ocean."

225
00:13:56,808 --> 00:13:58,097
Didn't it, honey?

226
00:13:58,217 --> 00:13:59,914
It may have said "sun rise."

227
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:02,431
We want your best room.

228
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:05,111
The honeymoon suite
is our best room.

229
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:07,317
There's always a better room.

230
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,451
Look, I'm sorry. Perhaps I can offer you
a complimentary breakfast.

231
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:12,814
I want a higher floor,

232
00:14:12,974 --> 00:14:14,522
a better view, and better lighting.

233
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:17,353
It was way too dark in there
with the curtains closed.

234
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:20,655
- How 'bout a one hour spa treatment?
- I want a better room.

235
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,691
We don't have a better one unless
you build it, and being a bitch

236
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:25,178
isn't gonna change that.

237
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,126
Rita.

238
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,565
Excuse me. I'll be right with you.

239
00:14:34,646 --> 00:14:37,388
- We can't have this conversation again.
- I know. I'm sorry.

240
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:39,720
This is the 2nd time this week.
You're always

241
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,301
on a break or calling in sick.
I don't know what's going on, but,

242
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:44,179
honestly, it's always something.

243
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,720
And now I have to comp
the honeymoon suite.

244
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:50,769
I'm really sorry, but I just
can't afford to employ you anymore.

245
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:55,203
Now, how can we make this right?

246
00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:57,233
<i>Some people are ticking time bombs.</i>

247
00:14:58,308 --> 00:14:59,568
<i>Ramon is one of them.</i>

248
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:02,049
<i>And Miguel needs
to see him explode.</i>

249
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:03,884
<i>The inciter,</i>

250
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:06,617
<i>that's a role
I've always been good at.</i>

251
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:09,349
Pick-up for Morgan.

252
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:14,792
Ramon. Hey, how you doing?

253
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:17,122
Dexter.

254
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:20,089
Oh, that's right.
Miguel said you two came here.

255
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,650
It's your secret spot, right?

256
00:15:23,183 --> 00:15:24,240
Not anymore.

257
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,265
Oh, don't worry.
I'll keep it between the three of us.

258
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:31,716
Jefe, another rum and coke.

259
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:34,294
Oh, and could I get
some extra pickles?

260
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:41,595
Hey, sorry about the way
Astor treated little Carlos yesterday.

261
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:43,946
Oh, right, you left.

262
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:45,073
Minor turf war.

263
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:47,465
Don't worry, I watched out for him.

264
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:50,374
Carlos is a tough kid.
He can hold his own.

265
00:15:50,797 --> 00:15:52,216
Yeah, I'm sure.

266
00:15:56,176 --> 00:15:58,156
Sure you want to be drinking that?

267
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,922
If I wasn't sure,
I wouldn't drink it.

268
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:02,583
It's just...

269
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:05,417
You know,
Miguel's worried about you.

270
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:07,867
No offense, Dexter,

271
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,717
but if Miguel has a problem with me

272
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,558
he will tell me himself.

273
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:13,760
Right.

274
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,478
I mean, he said he did.

275
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:19,242
But, yeah, he will again
if he needs to.

276
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:21,234
What goes on between
me and my brother

277
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:23,926
is between me and my brother.

278
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:25,667
Absolutely.

279
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:31,290
I just happened to be there
when Miguel needed someone to talk to.

280
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,350
Since I've been through it too.

281
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,167
My mother was killed
when I was a kid.

282
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:40,680
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:42,714
So I know how it feels.

284
00:16:45,266 --> 00:16:46,716
But it gets easier.

285
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,044
Like Miguel said,
when he accepted his loss

286
00:16:52,164 --> 00:16:54,080
and found closure, he moved on.

287
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,770
Nobody is accepting anything.

288
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,196
Okay?

289
00:16:58,723 --> 00:17:00,614
And when your department
gets off its ass

290
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:02,366
and starts
doing its fucking job,

291
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:05,194
maybe then me and my brother
will move on.

292
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:08,136
Extra pickles.

293
00:17:09,776 --> 00:17:10,663
Thanks.

294
00:17:14,837 --> 00:17:17,070
I must have misinterpreted
what he said.

295
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,033
Yeah.

296
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:19,668
You did.

297
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:23,542
Well, enjoy your dinner.

298
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:27,750
And tell carlos I said howdy.

299
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:43,357
I knew I'd find you still here.

300
00:17:44,514 --> 00:17:46,176
No rest for the wicked.

301
00:17:47,404 --> 00:17:49,278
What brings you to these parts?

302
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:53,413
I wanted to ask you
about Chicky Hines.

303
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:55,510
Again?

304
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,207
I got a witness who can provide
an alibi for Hines. It checks out.

305
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:01,084
I told you
I reviewed his statement.

306
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:04,399
- But you never talked to him.
- Oh, come on, Maria.

307
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:07,716
Your witness is a habitual criminal
who's just trying

308
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:09,613
to beat
his latest drug rap.

309
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,584
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
it isn't true.

310
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:13,247
And he can clear Hines.

311
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:15,533
Have you even met Chicky Hines?

312
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:18,435
I mean have...
Have you read his jacket?

313
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:21,313
- Because it's...
- Hines didn't do this crime.

314
00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:29,654
What's this really about?

315
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:32,527
- An innocent man behind bars.
- Maybe.

316
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:35,484
Maybe there's
something else at play.

317
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:40,498
Accepting the truth about James Doakes,
that was hard for all of us.

318
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:46,823
- I wasn't expecting that.
- I know. Look,

319
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:50,483
I shouldn't even have mentioned it.
But, come on, he was your partner.

320
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:53,316
He's your friend.

321
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,348
Maybe you think
he was railroaded, I don't know.

322
00:18:58,802 --> 00:19:01,061
And maybe that's coloring
how you're seeing Hines.

323
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:04,147
I'll admit it was hard.

324
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,525
But you know me,
you know I'm a pro.

325
00:19:09,378 --> 00:19:11,404
I also know you're human
like the rest of us.

326
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:17,743
I'm just putting that out there
because we're friends.

327
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:27,586
The fiancee's working
with a sketch artist now.

328
00:19:27,747 --> 00:19:31,408
It matches what the burglary division
already has on the break-ins, so

329
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:33,134
she's not giving us anything{\
we don't already have.} new.

330
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:37,117
Yeah, except for more stories
about how perfect her dead fiance was.

331
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:40,099
It's not easy realizing
you're alone in the world.

332
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,483
What's the blood splatter
telling you?

333
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:49,776
Just clarifying some discrepancies.

334
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:52,195
Well, clarify fast.
Hey, I'm gonna wrap this thing up.

335
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:55,527
- Get you guys back on the skinner case.
- You're preaching to the choir, sir.

336
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:58,910
- Morgan, your ass is...
- Thank you. I fucking noticed it.

337
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:02,998
Comp tickets to my keynote address
at the forensics conference.

338
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:04,957
Not really my thing.

339
00:20:05,118 --> 00:20:06,965
I'm flea-combing my dog that night.

340
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:10,238
- I'm seeing my little girl that night.
- You don't even know the date.

341
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:14,264
I gotta keep my schedule
open for her.

342
00:20:18,673 --> 00:20:20,014
Et tu, Dex-tay?

343
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,016
Wouldn't miss it.

344
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,010
<i>Masuka.</i>

345
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,112
<i>He's chosen the role
of court jester.</i>

346
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:34,247
<i>Now we only like him
when he's making us laugh.</i>

347
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:37,077
<i>Still, there's something to be said
for being a character actor.</i>

348
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:39,718
<i>The lead players
with all those emotions,</i>

349
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:41,478
<i>must be exhausting.</i>

350
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:49,591
Looks like the sketch
that burglary already has

351
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:52,677
- on the break-in suspect.
- You couldn't get any more out of her?

352
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:54,924
Officer morgan,
the woman's a wreck.

353
00:20:58,906 --> 00:20:59,714
So...

354
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:05,184
He didn't have any distinguishing marks,
any scars or tattoos?

355
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:07,714
Maybe.

356
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:09,522
I don't remember.

357
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,066
He ran right by you.

358
00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:13,503
I was surprised.

359
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,286
Let's take a deep breath.

360
00:21:16,694 --> 00:21:17,905
Close your eyes.

361
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:21,115
Try to picture it again.

362
00:21:22,754 --> 00:21:24,148
It's so horrible.

363
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:27,569
My Jack just lying there.

364
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:29,811
- Why is this happening?
- Okay...

365
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:32,779
- Let's not picture it anymore.
- Jack's never coming back.

366
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:34,797
Let's focus on something else
right now, okay?

367
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:36,841
We'll just focus on something else.

368
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,718
- Fiona.
- Hi.

369
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,840
How are you holding up?

370
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,553
- I'm not helping at all.
- Who you kidding?

371
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:47,394
You're doing great.
You're a champ.

372
00:21:47,965 --> 00:21:49,270
I'm trying, but...

373
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:53,556
Why don't we take a break
from all this

374
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:55,777
and we'll go look at some
pictures together, okay?

375
00:21:58,075 --> 00:22:00,588
We'll be in interview three
with the mug books.

376
00:22:00,835 --> 00:22:03,534
- I'll set it up.
- That's okay, I got it.

377
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:25,525
They say this part
should pass soon.

378
00:22:27,465 --> 00:22:29,212
They say I should glow.

379
00:22:29,332 --> 00:22:30,269
Am I glowing?

380
00:22:32,324 --> 00:22:33,465
You are to me.

381
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:42,114
I can't believe
I called a guest a bitch.

382
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:44,447
Sounded like
an accurate description.

383
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:48,330
I think I'm gonna talk to my boss
and ask for my job back.

384
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,416
Really? I always got the impression
you didn't particularly like that job.

385
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:52,999
It's a job.

386
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:56,543
No one's gonna hire me
knowing I have to go on maternity leave.

387
00:22:56,663 --> 00:22:59,382
Plus I barely have any savings.

388
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:02,177
I'm pregnant.
No health insurance.

389
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,409
My insurance would cover you.

390
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:08,480
If we got married we'd have joint
assets. You wouldn't have to worry.

391
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,864
And let's not forget about
marital deductions. With Astor

392
00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:12,792
and Cody as dependants...

393
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:21,298
No, huh?

394
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:32,131
That's one ugly guitar.

395
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:34,031
Ugly?

396
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:39,138
A beat-up guitar like this
speaks to the experience of its owner.

397
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:41,659
The many hard roads
we've traveled together.

398
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:44,678
- So you've had it a long time.
- No, a couple of weeks.

399
00:23:45,673 --> 00:23:47,513
Picked it up at a pawn shop
for 20 bucks.

400
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:49,902
Gives me a certain mystique,
doesn't it?

401
00:23:50,022 --> 00:23:51,616
You are full of shit.

402
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:55,406
So what do you need, officer?

403
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,786
A stiff drink after a shit day.

404
00:23:58,518 --> 00:24:01,194
- And you came here?
- For the margaritas, trust me.

405
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:03,488
One margarita.

406
00:24:07,306 --> 00:24:10,001
- How well do you know Quinn?
- He have something to do

407
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:12,127
- with your day being shit?
- Maybe.

408
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:15,834
I've heard stuff about him.
And he comes off

409
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:19,296
really slick, and then he turns around
he's all sensitive and caring.

410
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:23,174
What's his story,
is he a good guy or a bad guy?

411
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:26,714
- Does it have to be either/or?
- In my world, yeah.

412
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:29,825
But I can't figure out
which one he decided on.

413
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:31,184
All I know is, um,

414
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,519
Quinn helped me out of a jam
when I was in trouble.

415
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:40,733
The man gave me an opportunity,
and I took it.

416
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,948
Besides, without Quinn,

417
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:49,217
you would have no C.I.

418
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,997
and I'd be drinking alone.

419
00:24:54,844 --> 00:24:56,250
I doubt that.

420
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,091
Oh, you're a hungry man.

421
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:25,379
And you're a beautiful meal.

422
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:28,238
You, uh, you looking
for anything special tonight?

423
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:29,699
Your eyes.

424
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:32,447
They're soulful.

425
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:34,666
Well, the compliments are free.

426
00:25:34,786 --> 00:25:38,249
But an hour of my time costs.

427
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:41,503
It might be more than an hour.

428
00:25:45,063 --> 00:25:47,133
Take a pass, sergeant.

429
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,440
Tonight, for a couple
of hours anyway,

430
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,567
I'm not a...

431
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,061
Tonight, all night,

432
00:25:58,543 --> 00:25:59,374
I am.

433
00:26:03,435 --> 00:26:05,083
Shit, this is a sting.

434
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:10,865
Just shut up and go with this.
You god damn deadbeat.

435
00:26:11,148 --> 00:26:13,285
You come up to my room
and you ain't got no cash!

436
00:26:13,445 --> 00:26:16,349
Well, nobody sees Jazmin
that ain't got no cash.

437
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,373
You wasted my time,
you motherfucker.

438
00:26:24,731 --> 00:26:26,006
So she threw up?

439
00:26:26,488 --> 00:26:28,859
Yep. Her answer apparently.

440
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,714
Not really the response
you want to hear

441
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:33,313
to a marriage proposal.

442
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:35,283
Yeah, hence my call to you.

443
00:26:35,403 --> 00:26:37,088
And the bribe of a beer.

444
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,285
You've obviously had
one successful proposal.

445
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:42,328
Tell me your secret, O Wise One.

446
00:26:45,315 --> 00:26:46,680
Well, whatever you do,

447
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,347
don't suggest eloping
because a wedding conflicts

448
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:52,250
- with a big case you've got coming up.
- You did that?

449
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,571
It went over about as well
as yours did.

450
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:57,754
- I'm not the only hopeless one.
- You and me, buddy,

451
00:26:57,874 --> 00:26:59,629
making the women of America...

452
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:00,562
sick.

453
00:27:03,052 --> 00:27:06,337
I did eventually figure out that women
tend to lead with their hearts.

454
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:08,583
So you might try
leading with yours.

455
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:12,177
- Is that the only option?
- Only one that works, <i>hermano</i>.

456
00:27:14,857 --> 00:27:16,155
Speaking of <i>hermanos</i>,

457
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:18,433
- I ran into Ramon last night.
- I heard.

458
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:21,236
- Actually, I got an earful.
- Sorry.

459
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:23,912
I tried to reach out to him,
make a connection.

460
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,100
- I think I just upset him more.
- It's okay.

461
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,830
It led to a really good talk.

462
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:31,589
Talk?

463
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,822
I didn't tell him.

464
00:27:34,895 --> 00:27:36,326
I keep my promises.

465
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:39,774
But when and if you ever
feel comfortable telling him,

466
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:42,756
I'm just saying
I think Ramon's ready.

467
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:50,380
<i>Miguel keeps trying to cast Ramon</i>

468
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,480
<i>in the role
of misunderstood good guy.</i>

469
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,033
<i>Personally, I think he makes
a much better bad guy.</i>

470
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:56,985
<i>I just have to convince Miguel.</i>

471
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,692
A donut and a ticket
to hear me speak?

472
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:01,583
I'll take a donut.

473
00:28:05,866 --> 00:28:08,141
- You already got a ticket.
- You're bribing people

474
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:11,523
- to come to your keynote address?
- The whole donut thing works for you.

475
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:15,073
- The blind leading the blind.
- Donut and a ticket?

476
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:19,874
Just fucking take one.

477
00:28:21,344 --> 00:28:22,344
Hey.

478
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:24,688
Hey. Something up, lew?

479
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:28,879
You remember that statement you took
from the Chicky Hines alibi?

480
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,629
You want me to recite it by heart?

481
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,712
So you buy it?

482
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:35,465
Even though the alibi
comes from somebody

483
00:28:35,585 --> 00:28:37,847
- trying to beat a drug rap?
- It's solid.

484
00:28:39,857 --> 00:28:41,932
Is the A.D.A. still sitting on it?

485
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:46,194
Then you did all you could.

486
00:28:48,302 --> 00:28:49,024
Maybe.

487
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:55,582
Hell musta froze over 'cause cops
won't eat donuts anymore.

488
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,548
- Maybe the price is a little too high.
- Please.

489
00:28:59,668 --> 00:29:01,896
Why wouldn't they wanna support
a valuable colleague

490
00:29:02,016 --> 00:29:05,205
- during his shining moment?
- You want an honest answer to that?

491
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,832
It was rhetorical.

492
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
All right.

493
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:11,879
All right, tell me.

494
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:16,417
You're, like, the foulest
person I've ever met.

495
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,784
Every line out of your mouth

496
00:29:18,904 --> 00:29:20,179
is a sick joke.

497
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:23,318
- I'm funny.
- Yeah, you can be.

498
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,810
You can also be
completely revolting.

499
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,846
And sometimes
that's all people see.

500
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:31,242
What do you know?
You're the fucking new guy.

501
00:29:31,362 --> 00:29:33,843
Hey, Dr. Phil, your girlfriend's
coming in again

502
00:29:33,963 --> 00:29:36,031
to look at more mug books, so...

503
00:29:38,172 --> 00:29:39,225
Hi there, Deb.

504
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:42,322
Help yourself. I saved you one
with the cream filling.

505
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,300
Freak.

506
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,500
Sergeant Batista.

507
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,458
It's you.

508
00:29:55,985 --> 00:29:58,393
With clothes.
I mean, different clothes.

509
00:29:58,513 --> 00:30:01,405
Yeah, I'm detective
Barbara Gianna, Metro Vice.

510
00:30:01,525 --> 00:30:02,430
Can we talk?

511
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:05,701
Yeah.

512
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:13,344
Look, this department
has had a lot of shit

513
00:30:13,464 --> 00:30:15,884
dumped on it
with the Bay Harbor Butcher.

514
00:30:16,004 --> 00:30:18,571
And now you, a sergeant,

515
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:21,180
are looking to make the news
getting busted with hookers.

516
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,452
Now, I turn you in now,
I save this department worse later.

517
00:30:24,844 --> 00:30:27,037
'cause guys like you never learn.

518
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,791
- Look, maybe I'm an asshole, but...
- Do not...

519
00:30:31,216 --> 00:30:33,502
Insult me by saying
this is your first time.

520
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:35,922
Okay, 'cause I hear
this same horseshit sob story

521
00:30:36,082 --> 00:30:37,819
from every john I bust.

522
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:40,464
Does any part of you
think that any part of me

523
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:42,213
is proud of what I've done?

524
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,212
No part of me really cares.

525
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:46,857
It's just that...

526
00:30:49,316 --> 00:30:51,005
I destroyed my marriage.

527
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:55,321
I lost my little girl.

528
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:00,362
I'm a divorced cop

529
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,866
halfway down the road
to a full-blown cliché:

530
00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:08,663
a divorced, alcoholic cop.

531
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:12,741
And I needed to fight that...

532
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:17,439
Loneliness.

533
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:23,409
So I found affection
any way I could.

534
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:25,583
I mean, hookers?

535
00:31:25,703 --> 00:31:27,848
I needed to connect with someone,

536
00:31:28,258 --> 00:31:29,258
anyone,

537
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:32,226
who wouldn't hurt me back no more.

538
00:31:36,488 --> 00:31:37,488
That's it.

539
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,283
Not special.

540
00:31:43,286 --> 00:31:44,199
Just true.

541
00:31:48,144 --> 00:31:50,613
I hate anyone
who disgraces the badge.

542
00:31:51,188 --> 00:31:53,016
I hate liars worse.

543
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:55,083
I'm not lying.

544
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,081
I know.

545
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:01,299
Are we good?

546
00:32:01,998 --> 00:32:03,801
You keep your dick in your pants

547
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:06,666
unless you're:
a playing with yourself

548
00:32:06,786 --> 00:32:09,974
or b/ you are doing
something consensual and legal.

549
00:32:12,018 --> 00:32:13,315
Then we're good.

550
00:32:24,257 --> 00:32:25,471
Ramon, what are you...

551
00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:27,783
any progress on finding
Oscar's killer?

552
00:32:27,944 --> 00:32:30,571
We're liaising with the feds
in case he went over the border.

553
00:32:30,691 --> 00:32:32,998
But what if he's right here
in our own backyard?

554
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:35,041
It's an ongoing concern, Ramon.

555
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:36,958
But not a priority, right?

556
00:32:37,305 --> 00:32:38,489
Lower your voice.

557
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:40,581
- Is there a problem here?
- Yeah, sergeant,

558
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:43,046
your people don't know
what the fuck they're doing.

559
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:45,343
That credit you get for being a cop
has a limit.

560
00:32:45,503 --> 00:32:47,781
So you do have a game plan.
'Cause it doesn't seem

561
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:51,557
- to involve listening to solid leads.
- Every lead has been followed.

562
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:55,770
Then why am I getting calls from a guy
who says he saw Freebo in Miami?

563
00:32:56,315 --> 00:32:58,447
I'll tell you why,
because you ignored him.

564
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,834
- He called you 4 times.
- Never happened.

565
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:03,702
Ramon, you give me
this tipster's name,

566
00:33:03,822 --> 00:33:06,781
- I will personally follow through.
- The motherfucker was anonymous.

567
00:33:07,175 --> 00:33:09,709
<i>Did I forget to leave my name?
Sorry.</i>

568
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,870
But he knew things about this case.

569
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,290
- Like Freebo had a girlfriend, Teegan.
- A lot of people know that, sir.

570
00:33:15,706 --> 00:33:19,294
- I passed her photo all over town.
- Maybe the tipster wanted reward money.

571
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:22,463
You can find excuses,
or you can get off your asses

572
00:33:22,624 --> 00:33:26,474
- and try finding my brother's killer!
- OK. Ramon, you need to leave now!

573
00:33:37,106 --> 00:33:38,916
Just do your fucking job.

574
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:51,262
You wanna give his brother
the heads-up?

575
00:33:51,382 --> 00:33:52,371
You do it.

576
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,555
I'm a little tired
of the Prado family right now.

577
00:34:00,293 --> 00:34:02,295
<i>That was easier than I thought.</i>

578
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:09,807
<i>Miguel won't be happy to hear
Ramon's throwing tantrums</i>

579
00:34:09,927 --> 00:34:11,344
<i>with fellow law enforcement.</i>

580
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:15,016
<i>Not that I'll rely on that alone.</i>

581
00:34:15,371 --> 00:34:16,850
<i>The stakes are too high.</i>

582
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,478
<i>And I'm on a roll.</i>

583
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:23,358
<i>Maybe I should call Rita
with an anonymous tip to marry me.</i>

584
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:30,060
- Oh, what the fuck, Dex?
- Good, you're here. Put this on.

585
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,743
I don't need a giant condom.
I need your spatter report on Jack Rice.

586
00:34:33,903 --> 00:34:36,794
I'm working on it.
Just put on the suit and the gloves

587
00:34:36,914 --> 00:34:38,706
and the mask, please.

588
00:34:39,094 --> 00:34:40,094
Fine.

589
00:34:40,451 --> 00:34:42,544
The sooner I'm done
with the weeping fiancée,

590
00:34:42,704 --> 00:34:44,379
the better off I'll be.

591
00:34:45,256 --> 00:34:46,400
Raw emotion.

592
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,049
Not your forte.

593
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:51,770
- What the hell's that supposed to mean?
- It's not mine either.

594
00:34:52,213 --> 00:34:54,070
It's easy as hell for quinn.

595
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:57,475
Think he's just nicer than me?

596
00:34:58,133 --> 00:34:59,883
I don't know about nicer.

597
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:03,022
Although studies show
that emotional intelligence

598
00:35:03,323 --> 00:35:06,350
plays a greater role
in individual success

599
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,017
than anything that can be measured
on a standard I.Q. test.

600
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:11,658
Come here.

601
00:35:11,937 --> 00:35:15,159
Stand right here
and bash this for me, will you?

602
00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:19,372
- Are you calling me an emotional idiot?
- If you're an idiot, I'm a vegetable.

603
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,457
Well, that's for fucking sure.

604
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:26,337
Fucking-A, Dex!

605
00:35:28,052 --> 00:35:29,090
Sorry.

606
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,180
Fiona has her facts wrong.

607
00:35:36,256 --> 00:35:38,824
She described the assailant
as six-foot.

608
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,779
But calculating Jack Rice's height,

609
00:35:41,899 --> 00:35:44,388
- allowing for the upward angle...
- Layman here.

610
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:46,384
Well, your body acts as a shield.

611
00:35:46,504 --> 00:35:49,151
And all of this is what
your body doesn't block.

612
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:53,031
So the killer stuns
the victim with the first blow.

613
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:56,596
He falls to his knees.
The second blow brings us blood.

614
00:35:58,058 --> 00:35:59,956
If the killer was six-foot,

615
00:36:00,263 --> 00:36:04,068
the spatter shadow at the crime scene
would be taller and wider.

616
00:36:04,188 --> 00:36:07,160
Instead, it's an exact match
for your shadow.

617
00:36:07,975 --> 00:36:10,882
<i>Ergo</i> Rice's killer was approximately
your height and weight.

618
00:36:11,383 --> 00:36:13,551
You mean fucking weep-bag
Fiona's height and weight?

619
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:14,892
No, I mean...

620
00:36:19,075 --> 00:36:20,959
I missed that. Interesting.

621
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,014
- You and Jack planning a big wedding?
- Yeah.

622
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,466
Jack had a lot of friends, yeah.

623
00:36:40,586 --> 00:36:41,631
You know,

624
00:36:42,823 --> 00:36:45,586
the thing is, I went through
his address book

625
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,946
and I called a lot of people,

626
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:51,413
and none of them
have ever heard of you.

627
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:53,424
We like to keep to ourselves,
you know?

628
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:00,557
When was that taken?

629
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:06,019
It was right after we met.

630
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:08,355
Did he get a chance to see it
before you killed him?

631
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:11,735
What?

632
00:37:13,673 --> 00:37:16,058
What is she talking about?
I don't...

633
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,574
It's Photoshopped, Fiona.

634
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:24,163
It's really good work, though.
Really good. Did you do it yourself?

635
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:25,866
- God, no.
- See,

636
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:28,111
I'm thinking maybe
you broke into his apartment

637
00:37:28,231 --> 00:37:31,180
to leave that as a surprise. He comes
home, tries to throw your ass out,

638
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,904
- and you kill him.
- No, I would never hurt Jack.

639
00:37:34,024 --> 00:37:36,647
- We were getting married.
- You heard about the break-in on TV,

640
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:39,053
then you create the same sketch
that they show on TV,

641
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:42,015
the same crowbar in the back door.
You bash your own fucking knee in!

642
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:45,434
Did he ever even talk to you, Fiona?
Did he ever even say more than

643
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:47,187
"one fucking coffee to go"?

644
00:37:47,347 --> 00:37:48,353
That's it.

645
00:37:48,473 --> 00:37:50,268
This is over.

646
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:57,405
- I'm sorry?
- Wait outside, officer.

647
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,573
I'll take it from here.

648
00:38:11,437 --> 00:38:12,444
<i>It's all right.</i>

649
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:16,171
<i>I know</i>

650
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:19,148
<i>how it really was</i>

651
00:38:19,448 --> 00:38:20,675
<i>between you and Jack.</i>

652
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,363
<i>I know.</i>

653
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,281
<i>You all right?</i>

654
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:28,957
<i>It's safe.
It's just me and you.</i>

655
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:34,693
Can you believe this shit?

656
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:36,731
It's amazing.
She's so convincing.

657
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,124
I'm talking about him.

658
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:40,528
I'm gonna kick
his Cadillac-driving ass.

659
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,341
<i>Before Jack,</i>

660
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:46,451
<i>my life was an unanswered question.</i>

661
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,870
Unanswered question.

662
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:51,915
<i>Days and nights
spent looking for something.</i>

663
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:54,834
Quinn played me
like a fucking $20 guitar.

664
00:38:57,415 --> 00:38:59,960
<i>The first time
he came into the cafe,</i>

665
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:03,161
<i>I felt him.</i>

666
00:39:06,852 --> 00:39:08,905
<i>We were connected, you know?</i>

667
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,110
<i>Everywhere I went, he was with me.</i>

668
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,065
<i>Jack made me real.</i>

669
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:18,833
Made me real.

670
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,467
She believes it...

671
00:39:20,717 --> 00:39:22,487
Down to her core.
It's not an act.

672
00:39:23,211 --> 00:39:25,509
The only actor in that room
is Quinn.

673
00:39:35,346 --> 00:39:36,459
<i>If Fiona can be</i>

674
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,586
<i>this convincing about someone
she didn't know,</i>

675
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:40,810
<i>I should be able
to convince Rita.</i>

676
00:39:41,316 --> 00:39:42,431
<i>And others.</i>

677
00:39:43,844 --> 00:39:44,831
Ellen?

678
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:05,282
You found the place!
I couldn't have waited much longer.

679
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:06,971
A client just sent me these.

680
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,617
Without a responsible adult
to share them with or shame me,

681
00:40:10,153 --> 00:40:12,271
I would eat them all.
I would.

682
00:40:12,726 --> 00:40:13,952
Try that one.

683
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,542
Seriously, ganache frosting.

684
00:40:21,054 --> 00:40:22,534
Oh, what the hell?

685
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,744
I'm guessing you wanted
to meet for reasons

686
00:40:27,911 --> 00:40:30,764
other than working up a case
of type 2 diabetes.

687
00:40:31,363 --> 00:40:33,016
The Chicky Hines conviction.

688
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:40,690
Not the justice system's
finest hour.

689
00:40:41,408 --> 00:40:44,319
My people have come across evidence
that could get the case reopened.

690
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:48,547
I like the sound of the quid.
What's the pro quo?

691
00:40:51,902 --> 00:40:54,025
Witness statement
giving Hines an alibi,

692
00:40:54,275 --> 00:40:56,665
another suspect.
All of which checks out.

693
00:41:10,847 --> 00:41:12,550
Two-plus decades doing this job,

694
00:41:12,717 --> 00:41:15,772
and a cop's never once handed me
a get-out-of-jail card.

695
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,646
Especially when that cop's
got a history with the A.D.A.

696
00:41:20,813 --> 00:41:22,399
who put my guy away.

697
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,016
This isn't about Miguel Prado.

698
00:41:26,668 --> 00:41:28,112
It's about doing
what's right.

699
00:41:29,514 --> 00:41:31,741
Well, I'll take "yes"
for an answer then.

700
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:38,095
Prado know
you're coming to me with this?

701
00:41:39,216 --> 00:41:40,417
Guess he'll find out.

702
00:41:44,717 --> 00:41:46,552
Well, you better
be wearing old clothes,

703
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:48,174
'cause the shit'll be flying

704
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:49,709
in your direction.

705
00:41:55,925 --> 00:41:57,183
Cupcakes and scotch.

706
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:02,606
Come on.

707
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,150
2 fingers.

708
00:42:08,386 --> 00:42:10,835
Yeah, I'm tellin' you,
I saw Freebo again.

709
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:13,289
No, man, i'm not comin' in.

710
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:16,563
Fine, I'll meet you.
Got a favorite bar?

711
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:20,415
Yeah, I know it. Order me
a rum and coke. I'll be there in 10.

712
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:24,328
<i>You can lead a horse to water,
but you can't make him drink,</i>

713
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:27,438
<i>unless you order his favorite
and keep him waiting.</i>

714
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,389
<i>And waiting.</i>

715
00:42:36,002 --> 00:42:37,566
So the nut job went.

716
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:40,679
She said she caved his head in
to preserve their love.

717
00:42:41,945 --> 00:42:43,149
Good work.

718
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,066
- How 'bout I buy you a drink?
- How 'bout you kiss my ass?

719
00:42:47,853 --> 00:42:50,904
Next time you're playing good cop
bad cop, let me know I'm playing too.

720
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:54,658
- Sorry about that.
- When'd you figure out she did it?

721
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:56,644
I had a hunch from the beginning.

722
00:42:56,894 --> 00:42:58,620
But I wasn't sure until you were.

723
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,748
- Why didn't you tell me?
- 'cause you'd have blown it.

724
00:43:02,598 --> 00:43:03,667
So fuck you.

725
00:43:04,158 --> 00:43:05,501
Morgan, you got one tool

726
00:43:05,668 --> 00:43:06,878
in your toolbox.

727
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:08,393
And that's a hammer.

728
00:43:08,602 --> 00:43:10,141
You can't help yourself.

729
00:43:10,391 --> 00:43:11,966
So I played off it, and it worked.

730
00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:16,782
You just don't have
a poker face yet.

731
00:43:17,414 --> 00:43:19,849
Maybe yours is a little too good.

732
00:43:29,886 --> 00:43:31,265
Don't you have a life?

733
00:43:32,378 --> 00:43:33,460
Not lately.

734
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:37,075
I needed to talk to you
about Ramon.

735
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:39,453
Yeah, I heard he made a scene.

736
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:41,079
- Sorry.
- Actually,

737
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:43,035
it was an eye-opener.

738
00:43:47,017 --> 00:43:48,893
Made me realize you were right.

739
00:43:50,411 --> 00:43:52,184
- About?
- Telling him...

740
00:43:53,647 --> 00:43:54,885
about Freebo.

741
00:43:57,589 --> 00:43:59,818
He's putting his career at risk.

742
00:44:00,068 --> 00:44:03,106
And it could hurt your reputation.
I'm not gonna be responsible for that.

743
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,810
Don't worry.
Ramon will always put family first.

744
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,166
We worked too hard
to get to where we are.

745
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:10,111
He would never jeopardize that.

746
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:11,891
And we can trust him?

747
00:44:14,174 --> 00:44:15,488
He's in a lot of pain.

748
00:44:17,796 --> 00:44:19,217
Which we can end.

749
00:44:19,947 --> 00:44:20,785
Tonight.

750
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,999
Call him.

751
00:44:33,703 --> 00:44:35,590
Ramon, what are you up to?

752
00:44:38,327 --> 00:44:39,429
Hold on.

753
00:44:41,714 --> 00:44:44,267
Why don't you just get the bartender
to call you a taxi,

754
00:44:44,517 --> 00:44:45,685
or I'll--

755
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:47,634
<i>Nah, fuck you, Miguel.</i>

756
00:44:47,884 --> 00:44:50,317
<i>The motherfucking bartender
won't even give me--</i>

757
00:45:05,963 --> 00:45:07,568
Having a big night, huh?

758
00:45:08,527 --> 00:45:11,796
What I'm having is another drink,
but this prick is trying to cut me off.

759
00:45:12,729 --> 00:45:14,089
Oh, and you're here.

760
00:45:14,533 --> 00:45:15,751
Boys' night out.

761
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:18,233
So why don't we just
all go back to my place?

762
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,804
- Syl'll make coffee--
- I'm not going to your place.

763
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,330
Sara and the kids
can't see you like this.

764
00:45:23,497 --> 00:45:25,308
Like you're an example
in this family?

765
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,139
Turning your back on Oscarito!

766
00:45:29,514 --> 00:45:31,612
This is not the place.
Now, you know that.

767
00:45:32,857 --> 00:45:33,984
Tell me something.

768
00:45:34,534 --> 00:45:37,821
Why are you running your mouth
about family business to a god damn

769
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:40,175
- stranger?
- Dexter is not the problem.

770
00:45:40,425 --> 00:45:41,678
Now, come on, please.

771
00:45:41,845 --> 00:45:43,785
The 2 of you coming in here
like some kind

772
00:45:44,035 --> 00:45:45,244
of Batman and Robin.

773
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:48,832
Keep your hands off of me.

774
00:45:49,782 --> 00:45:51,459
I'm sorry, Dexter. I got this.

775
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,254
- You sure?
- He said fuck off.

776
00:45:56,723 --> 00:45:58,091
I'll get another drink.

777
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,382
That drunk guy over there
just put his hand on that girl.

778
00:46:01,632 --> 00:46:04,083
She's pretty upset,
and I think I saw a gun.

779
00:46:18,686 --> 00:46:20,030
<i>I take no pleasure</i>

780
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,080
<i>in manipulating Miguel this way.</i>

781
00:46:22,737 --> 00:46:25,604
<i>Still, I think he'd prefer it
to my usual alternative.</i>

782
00:46:33,807 --> 00:46:35,253
Didn't return my last text.

783
00:46:38,734 --> 00:46:41,426
I ran out of ways to say
I won't be your fuckin' rat.

784
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:44,804
Heard about a tricky case.

785
00:46:45,758 --> 00:46:47,933
- I just filed the report.
- I just read it.

786
00:46:48,962 --> 00:46:50,268
According to the report,

787
00:46:50,883 --> 00:46:53,309
Quinn cracked the case
mostly on his own,

788
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:55,898
and I'm wondering why someone
hoping to get her shield

789
00:46:56,065 --> 00:46:57,692
would let him
write it up that way.

790
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:01,708
I wrote the god damn report.

791
00:47:02,102 --> 00:47:02,900
Not him.

792
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,949
He got the confession,
so it's his win.

793
00:47:05,481 --> 00:47:07,244
Unless he used you.

794
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,955
He's good at that.

795
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,206
You partner with him,
you trust him,

796
00:47:12,373 --> 00:47:14,613
and sooner or later
you're questioning yourself.

797
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,378
I mean, he's such a great guy.

798
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:17,845
It can't be him.

799
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,367
Except the only question
he's asking

800
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:24,183
is how everything can benefit him.

801
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:55,272
Hey, breakfast.

802
00:47:56,867 --> 00:47:58,260
Thanks for coming.

803
00:48:05,253 --> 00:48:06,761
We used to play on this beach.

804
00:48:07,623 --> 00:48:09,347
Me, Ramon, Oscar.

805
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,590
Sounds fun.

806
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,353
We had each other.

807
00:48:14,478 --> 00:48:15,353
Always have.

808
00:48:18,631 --> 00:48:20,942
No matter what kind
of horrible shit you would pull,

809
00:48:22,509 --> 00:48:25,906
they knew you inside out,
the good and the bad.

810
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:28,867
And they were there for you.

811
00:48:33,057 --> 00:48:34,487
I never had that.

812
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:40,152
Maybe you're lucky
you don't have it to lose.

813
00:48:43,076 --> 00:48:45,133
You won't be left
with a gaping hole.

814
00:48:46,349 --> 00:48:49,355
No, there's still holes.
I just find other ways to fill them.

815
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:57,270
I lost Oscar to drugs
long before he was killed.

816
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:00,440
And now I'm losing Ramon.

817
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:02,620
I can't fool myself.

818
00:49:05,929 --> 00:49:07,461
He can't be trusted.

819
00:49:08,985 --> 00:49:10,325
It's like...

820
00:49:13,321 --> 00:49:15,288
I only have one person
I can trust anymore.

821
00:49:17,292 --> 00:49:18,490
Yourself.

822
00:49:20,852 --> 00:49:22,128
I was thinking of you.

823
00:49:27,845 --> 00:49:31,096
Don't worry. I know that trust
doesn't come too easy to you.

824
00:49:33,441 --> 00:49:34,773
Is it that obvious?

825
00:49:35,023 --> 00:49:36,058
To me.

826
00:49:37,959 --> 00:49:41,481
I can just see that you're used
to carrying your secrets to yourself.

827
00:49:46,823 --> 00:49:48,268
Tends to be safer that way.

828
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:50,240
But it's a hell of a burden, man.

829
00:49:51,677 --> 00:49:53,680
See, I'm used to having a brother.

830
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,623
Share the load.

831
00:50:06,418 --> 00:50:08,300
I'm hoping
you'll get used to it too.

832
00:50:12,334 --> 00:50:13,800
<i>To be a brother.</i>

833
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:17,677
<i>To have a friend.</i>

834
00:50:21,941 --> 00:50:23,857
<i>To have a wife, a family.</i>

835
00:50:31,074 --> 00:50:33,200
<i>Fiona wanted it so bad
she invented it,</i>

836
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:35,424
<i>played all the parts herself.</i>

837
00:50:40,008 --> 00:50:41,785
<i>But if you play a role
long enough,</i>

838
00:50:41,952 --> 00:50:43,374
<i>really commit,</i>

839
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:45,837
<i>does it ever become real?</i>

840
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:53,306
<i>Could I become real?</i>

841
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,355
It's a surprise.
You didn't call.

842
00:51:06,941 --> 00:51:08,902
Is everything all right?

843
00:51:15,061 --> 00:51:16,368
Dexter, what is it?

844
00:51:18,343 --> 00:51:20,708
My life has always felt like...

845
00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:23,625
an unanswered question.

846
00:51:26,725 --> 00:51:30,159
A string of days and nights, waiting
for something to happen, but...

847
00:51:31,217 --> 00:51:32,383
I didn't know what.

848
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:35,178
Why is he acting so weird?

849
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:36,868
I don't know.

850
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,770
Rita, we're connected.

851
00:51:44,892 --> 00:51:46,648
Wherever I am,

852
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,065
I feel you...

853
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:53,446
and the kids...

854
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:55,991
with me.

855
00:51:57,726 --> 00:51:59,704
You're what makes me real.

856
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,615
I want us to...

857
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,501
always go out for banana splits.

858
00:52:08,574 --> 00:52:11,550
And replant the lemon tree
that keeps dying.

859
00:52:12,215 --> 00:52:14,175
And I never, ever
