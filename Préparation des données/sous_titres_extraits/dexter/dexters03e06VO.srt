1
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,062
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter...

2
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:44,045
I just got the sheriff's department.

3
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:46,733
They've confirmed their skinning victim
is related to ours.

4
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:48,170
That gives us 3 victims.

5
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,822
I've got units bringing in
a 15-year-old kid, Wendell Owens.

6
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:53,240
He was Freebo's doorman.

7
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:56,642
If things get really bad,
you use that card and call me, okay?

8
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,371
You think I cut this kid loose
to make you look bad?

9
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,440
I'm not sure anymore...

10
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:03,364
Partner.

11
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:05,502
You know a Joey Quinn?

12
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,255
Cooperation with I.A.
has its upside.

13
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,674
Yuki, that's not gonna happen.

14
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:12,566
Ramon's obsessed.
He's not going

15
00:02:12,686 --> 00:02:15,846
to stop looking for Oscar's killer
until it takes him all the way down.

16
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:17,797
- Is there a problem here?
- Yeah, sergeant.

17
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:19,957
Your people don't know
what the fuck they're doing.

18
00:02:20,077 --> 00:02:22,027
That guy is wound way too tight.

19
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:23,645
Where ya been, Dexter?

20
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,780
How are you, Camilla?

21
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:28,442
I've been better.

22
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,945
Are you, looking for
anything special tonight?

23
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:33,822
Might be more than an hour.

24
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:37,567
Take a pass...

25
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,661
Sergeant.

26
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:43,017
Anton, open up. It's me.

27
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,547
The Chicky Hines conviction.

28
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:52,716
My people have come across evidence
that could get the case reopened.

29
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:54,794
Prado know you're
coming to me with this?

30
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:57,180
Don't you see what happened today?

31
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:59,566
I gave you the chance
to avenge two women

32
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:01,726
whom the system failed,
and just like I hoped,

33
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:04,118
you seized that opportunity.

34
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,857
I see who you are. I am with you.

35
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:09,490
Behind you.

36
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,689
I respect you.

37
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:25,793
He's tired. Keep on reeling.

38
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:26,963
You got him.

39
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:28,137
Here he comes!

40
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:29,337
Come here!

41
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:34,358
Oh, shit!

42
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:39,917
Go ahead.

43
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,884
That's gonna be
some mighty fine eating.

44
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:46,145
Man, on the grill
with Syl's mango and lime salsa.

45
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,855
Our house tomorrow night.

46
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:50,705
Check with the little woman...

47
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:53,188
Who's getting bigger as we speak.

48
00:03:55,064 --> 00:03:57,510
<i>I could get used to the simple
joys of male bonding.</i>

49
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,480
Hey, how 'bout a... Brewski?

50
00:04:00,944 --> 00:04:02,394
Ah, that looks good.

51
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:05,382
So Dex...

52
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,627
What was it like?

53
00:04:11,695 --> 00:04:12,846
In Bimini.

54
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:19,303
- Flat, mostly. Lots of mangroves.
- Talking about Ethan Turner.

55
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,140
- What about him?
- What did it feel like to...

56
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:24,474
Take him out?

57
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:26,633
To end his life.

58
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:31,849
<i>So much for the simple joys
of male bonding.</i>

59
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:36,080
<i>Like I could explain
or Miguel could understand.</i>

60
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,199
You put people on death row.
You must know what it's like.

61
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,798
No, but there's like
an ocean of bureaucracy

62
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:46,163
of briefs and appeals between me
and that bad guy taking his last breath.

63
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:49,655
I'm asking you what did it feel like
to use your hands, to...

64
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,793
To make this a better place?

65
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,645
It felt...

66
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:58,134
right.

67
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,980
Felt like justice.

68
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:08,511
I've got five floors of prosecutors

69
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:12,105
and the whole police department at my
fingertips, and you did what I couldn't.

70
00:05:12,932 --> 00:05:14,274
You came through for me.

71
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:17,487
I been sleeping like
a baby ever since.

72
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:22,699
It was hot today.

73
00:05:24,253 --> 00:05:25,911
Like I said the other night,

74
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:27,454
I know you, Dexter.

75
00:05:28,372 --> 00:05:29,456
I see who you are.

76
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:31,656
We're like-minded.

77
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:35,754
Together, we can make a difference.

78
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:38,192
<i>We?</i>

79
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,136
<i>Miguel, my amigo,
claims to know me.</i>

80
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:45,466
<i>On some level,
I suppose maybe that's true.</i>

81
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:47,517
Who are you kidding?

82
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,186
He knows about Freebo.

83
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,616
He detailed me
to the Ethan Turner kill.

84
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:01,446
He's seen me with blood
on my hands and hasn't blinked.

85
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:05,216
Miguel's got no clue
what's really going on inside you.

86
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,952
The urge, the ritual.

87
00:06:07,254 --> 00:06:10,983
Miguel has really gone out of his way
to understand who I am...

88
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,792
Which is more than you ever did.

89
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,457
Well, I understood.

90
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,047
I just couldn't accept it.

91
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:22,676
And Miguel won't either.

92
00:06:23,893 --> 00:06:25,721
You didn't want me
to have any friends.

93
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:28,004
You think Miguel's a pal?

94
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:29,656
Your wingman?

95
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:33,665
You might wanna put
that notion to the test...

96
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:36,815
See how like-minded
you and Miguel really are.

97
00:06:40,755 --> 00:06:43,105
Every time you let
someone get close,

98
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:45,406
it ends badly.

99
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:52,705
<i>I do need to consider
my spotty record connecting</i>

100
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,429
<i>with others.</i>

101
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:56,760
<i>But Miguel's not going away.</i>

102
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:59,010
<i>I need to make him
understand the risks.</i>

103
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,480
<i>When he does, he'll wanna
rethink the like-minded thing.</i>

104
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,382
<i>Just because he can gut a fish
doesn't qualify him</i>

105
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:08,285
<i>to hang with me while I...</i>

106
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:10,165
<i>Do what I do best.</i>

107
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:23,429
You need a jump? I have cables.

108
00:07:27,128 --> 00:07:29,785
Skinner struck again.
Super-hard this time.

109
00:07:29,905 --> 00:07:32,954
The victim's name was Wendell Owen.
He was 15 years old.

110
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:36,695
It's more collateral damage
in our search for fucking Freebo.

111
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:37,965
Wendell Owens?

112
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,758
I brought him in
for questioning the other day.

113
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:44,717
I remembered
hearing his name somewhere.

114
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:48,221
He might have been mixed up with some
lowlifes, but he was a decent kid.

115
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,016
Go do your thing.
I just need a min.

116
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:08,445
Body's still warm.
Putting time of death about 3 h ago.

117
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:11,024
Unlike the two previous victims,
this one died

118
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:13,965
- from the skinning process itself.
- Jesus Christ.

119
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:17,258
Freebo's probably in another galaxy
and the skinner doesn't even know it.

120
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:19,709
Meanwhile, he's
stepping up his game.

121
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:22,683
Maybe we let the press
know Freebo got outta dodge,

122
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:25,540
might get this guy
to put down his Ginzu knife.

123
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,009
Or he'll keep looking,

124
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:29,807
take his horror show on the road,
become somebody else's nightmare.

125
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,430
No, I wanna nail
whoever's doing this.

126
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:36,226
He's definitely not learning to do this
on the fly. He's had plenty of practice.

127
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:39,008
Run this through
the national database,

128
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:41,878
see if a similar MO
comes up anywhere else.

129
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:52,820
<i>What I need to find right now
is a target to present to Miguel</i>

130
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,790
<i>with a high degree
of difficulty and jeopardy.</i>

131
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,128
<i>So that he truly understands
that he's in way over his head.</i>

132
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,043
I have a question.

133
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,345
It's serious.
I can't ask any of the other cops.

134
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,889
I'm all yours.

135
00:09:14,457 --> 00:09:16,135
It's about the skinner.

136
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,570
His last two victims,
Wendell and Javier,

137
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,271
they were both killed after
I was done questioning them.

138
00:09:23,754 --> 00:09:26,777
Do you think the skinner's
drafting off my investigation?

139
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,634
- Anything's possible.
- Because I'm freaking out

140
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:34,791
that whoever's looking for Freebo
is using me to attract him.

141
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,329
Who else knows
you brought Wendell in?

142
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,840
His mom...

143
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,728
All the cops in the station.

144
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,945
Anton.

145
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:44,712
Ramon Prado.

146
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:48,298
Miguel's brother.

147
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:53,495
The law and order hard ass sheriff
who's been obsessed

148
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:56,139
about finding Freebo
for killing his little brother.

149
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,558
There's your motive.

150
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,686
Do we seriously think
that Ramon, a fellow cop,

151
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:04,135
could do something this sick?

152
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:07,692
Like a career in law enforcement
precludes violent behavior?

153
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:10,904
Can you imagine the shit storm
this is gonna create if I'm wrong?

154
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:13,573
It'll create a worse
shit storm if you're right.

155
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:18,745
Keep me in the loop.

156
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:23,458
Ramon's got anger issues.
I don't want you getting hurt.

157
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:27,348
You do care about me.

158
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,884
Wait till you see
the wine cellar at <i>The Forge</i>.

159
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:33,302
It is legendary!

160
00:10:34,128 --> 00:10:36,167
They even have a bottle
of <i>Chateau d'Yquem</i>...

161
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:37,758
belonged to Thomas Jefferson.

162
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:41,310
I'm kind of a <i>cuba libre</i>
kinda girl myself.

163
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:45,794
<i>Ellen, it's me. Nicely done.</i>

164
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:48,319
<i>Handing Miguel Prado
his head on a pike today,</i>

165
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,196
<i>make the Hines motion stick,
he could be disbarred.</i>

166
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,316
<i>Bravissimo.</i>

167
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:58,428
I was gonna talk to you about this,
if and when my motion's upheld.

168
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:01,663
How 'bout we talk about it now?

169
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:09,338
Miguel's been playing fast and loose
for a long time with legal ethics.

170
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,883
The Chicky Hines case
is just one example

171
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:14,569
on a very long list
of prosecutorial misconduct.

172
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:18,264
I came to you with information
to help your client,

173
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:22,804
not for you to trump up some witch hunt
against my friend and colleague.

174
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:27,635
You can't possibly believe
he's either of those things

175
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:31,181
- if you really knew Miguel...
- Believe me, I know Miguel.

176
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,725
I will explain everything
over dinner.

177
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,630
No, thanks.

178
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:39,868
I'm not feeling especially
social right now.

179
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:53,340
I hope I'm not interrupting.

180
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,259
No, I'm alone. Come on in.

181
00:11:58,126 --> 00:11:59,321
Taking the night off?

182
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:07,370
So, um... beer?

183
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:09,774
- Sure.
- Pot?

184
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:11,689
Fuck you.

185
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,032
Sounded kind of upset on the phone.

186
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:22,176
I'm kind of upset in person too.

187
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:28,506
You didn't talk to anyone

188
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:30,877
about me bringing Wendell in
for questioning?

189
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:35,048
No. I don't talk to anybody
about anything.

190
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:37,959
I try to keep the whole C.I.
Thing under wraps, you know?

191
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,282
Then how the hell did it get out?

192
00:12:40,752 --> 00:12:44,102
Well, it's a pretty safe bet
Wendell didn't tell anybody.

193
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:49,638
You should have seen
what this sicko did to him.

194
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:51,108
I'm glad I didn't.

195
00:12:52,624 --> 00:12:55,507
What would make anyone go that hard
on a street kid, for Christ's sakes?

196
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:57,885
There's this guy I'm looking at...

197
00:12:58,005 --> 00:13:00,455
He's a cop
who had a beef with Freebo.

198
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,619
He saw me in the station
when I was questioning Wendell.

199
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:09,576
Wouldn't be the first time the boys in
blue handled their own business, right?

200
00:13:12,064 --> 00:13:15,506
I can't rule out that I put
Wendell in the crosshairs.

201
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:19,052
He trusted me
enough to cooperate, and...

202
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,430
Look what happened to him.

203
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:31,051
Hey, look...

204
00:13:34,004 --> 00:13:36,485
Even if you're right,
you couldn't have known,

205
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:38,503
right?

206
00:13:41,313 --> 00:13:42,574
Don't beat yourself up.

207
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:48,997
It's what I do best, huh?

208
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:01,177
I should go.

209
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:03,379
All right.

210
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:10,689
Hey, look, um...

211
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:13,916
That girl from
the other night was...

212
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:16,232
Was nothing serious.

213
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,574
It's none of my business anyway.

214
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:22,428
Yeah, right.

215
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:25,904
Right.

216
00:14:27,564 --> 00:14:28,814
Jenna Kendrick.

217
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:31,706
One of the first crime scenes
I worked blood spatter.

218
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:35,919
This is somebody's daughter.

219
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:41,007
And that was done to her
by this animal.

220
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:42,342
Clemson Galt.

221
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:43,853
Aryan affiliated.

222
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:47,096
Took a claw hammer to her
for getting pregnant.

223
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:50,130
He was arrested for murder,
even confessed to his cellmate.

224
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,100
He called it "hammer time."

225
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:54,141
They get a conviction?

226
00:14:54,376 --> 00:14:57,259
Galt's Aryan affiliates
either got witnesses to recant

227
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:00,695
or made them disappear.
Verdict came back not guilty.

228
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:03,112
That type of stuff
happens way too often.

229
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:07,408
Galt's doing 15 to 20 for armed robbery
in a supermax upstate.

230
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,508
That's something.
Get him off the streets.

231
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:12,007
Only he's still running things
from his prison cell.

232
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:15,417
The wife and three kids
of an Aryan defector,

233
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:17,376
killed with a claw hammer.

234
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:23,473
While you're sleeping like a baby,
this is who's keeping me up nights.

235
00:15:26,469 --> 00:15:28,376
<i>Justice comes at a price,</i>

236
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:31,349
<i>one that Miguel is about
to discover he can't afford.</i>

237
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,469
This asshole doesn't
deserve to breathe, OK?

238
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:36,837
You're not gonna get any
argument with me about that.

239
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,454
But he's in custody.

240
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:41,109
In a supermax, no less.

241
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:43,675
That's always been the problem.

242
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,909
You're the big deal law enforcement guy.
I bet you could get us access.

243
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:53,162
That's beyond dangerous, Dexter.
That's crazy!

244
00:15:53,724 --> 00:15:55,227
<i>I knew if I appealed to reason,</i>

245
00:15:55,347 --> 00:15:58,108
<i>Miguel would eventually
understand the downside.</i>

246
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:01,963
Never mind that my fingerprints
will be all over this!

247
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,966
<i>Reason leads to self-preservation,</i>

248
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:06,707
<i>a potent force.</i>

249
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:10,555
We both would be seriously
exposed here.

250
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:14,883
<i>I just need to sit back.</i>

251
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:17,818
<i>He'll see the pros are heavily
outweighed by the cons,</i>

252
00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:20,588
<i>and we'll be back to</i> mojitos
<i>and barbecues.</i>

253
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:25,798
When you get right down to it,
I guess Ethan Turner

254
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:29,616
was an accident of opportunity,
a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

255
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:32,164
What about Freebo?

256
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,740
Another accident of opportunity?

257
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,500
Well, that situation
just sort of... unfolded.

258
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:41,278
You're right.

259
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:44,638
We both have too much to lose.

260
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,469
Hey, we took out
the garbage... twice.

261
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:50,511
We should quit while we're ahead.

262
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,540
I owe you this one, Dexter.

263
00:16:56,904 --> 00:16:58,630
You stuck your neck
out for me twice now.

264
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,190
- You don't owe me.
- Fair is fair. I won't let you down.

265
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,528
But we need to come up
with a real plan.

266
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:09,641
<i>Again...</i>

267
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:10,763
<i>"we".</i>

268
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:14,130
<i>Miguel surprised me last night.</i>

269
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,032
<i>I expected him to say no and he gave me
a definite maybe instead.</i>

270
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,072
Hey! No doughnuts today?

271
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:21,991
Not today, Vince.

272
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:24,472
Talk about your passive aggressive.

273
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:27,374
<i>Clemson Galt has been
on my Top 10 list for years,</i>

274
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:29,334
<i>and Miguel could be a big help.</i>

275
00:17:29,454 --> 00:17:31,544
<i>But the goal here
isn't to satisfy my need.</i>

276
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:34,300
<i>It's to get Miguel
to find some other hobby.</i>

277
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:36,978
Got a minute?

278
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:41,720
- Who's sick?
- Remember Camilla from records?

279
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,118
She's in the hospital.
It's not looking good,

280
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:46,834
- so I got everyone to sign.
- Camilla's sick?

281
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,440
Sorry, I thought you knew.

282
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:51,615
Lung cancer. It's terminal.

283
00:17:52,315 --> 00:17:53,450
Just like Gene.

284
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:55,244
Camilla's husband.

285
00:17:55,404 --> 00:17:58,206
My folks used to play cards with them
when Deb and I were growing up.

286
00:17:58,326 --> 00:18:00,061
He died just last year.

287
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:01,552
Lung cancer too.

288
00:18:01,672 --> 00:18:03,711
- Smokers?
- Chimneys.

289
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:06,448
Life catches up.

290
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:07,891
Yeah.

291
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:10,186
So does death.

292
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:12,469
It's a shame. She's a good person.

293
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:14,221
It sounds like she was a friend.

294
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:17,688
A good friend.

295
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,010
Those are in short
supply these days.

296
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:24,935
Camilla's at Good Samaritan.
You could drop that off,

297
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:27,021
let her know she's in our prayers.

298
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,777
- I'll do that.
- Thanks.

299
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:33,363
Detective Gianna, Sergeant Batista,
Miami-Metro Homicide.

300
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,776
- How can I help you, sergeant?
- <i>I was...</i>

301
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:38,915
<i>wondering, Detective...</i>

302
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:41,395
maybe we could...

303
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:44,001
See each other.

304
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,779
As in a... date?

305
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,591
Well, yeah.
You could call it that.

306
00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:52,151
Look,

307
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:53,969
Sergeant, let's be clear,

308
00:18:54,506 --> 00:18:55,838
<i>'cause being clear</i>

309
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:57,765
will save us both a lot of agita.

310
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:02,832
I don't date.

311
00:19:03,686 --> 00:19:04,521
Ever.

312
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:07,760
Do you eat... ever?

313
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:10,319
Sometimes.

314
00:19:11,524 --> 00:19:13,030
Good nutrition's important.

315
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:17,539
I'll tell you what, sergeant.
I get hungry enough,

316
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:19,000
I will call you.

317
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:35,107
- What?
- Can I throw something at you

318
00:19:35,227 --> 00:19:38,087
- that might sound a little crazy?
- Crazy? From you?

319
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:42,079
- Ramon Prado.
- What about him?

320
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,811
Do we like him for the skinner?

321
00:19:48,781 --> 00:19:52,123
- Okay, that's not a little crazy.
- He has access to all of our records,

322
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:54,275
so he knows exactly
who I've been talking to.

323
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:56,752
And we've all seen him up close,
he's not a stable guy.

324
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:59,701
- He's a fucking whack job.
- I looked into his work schedule.

325
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:02,162
He was off duty when
the last two murders went down.

326
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:05,232
You seriously wanna look
at Ramon Prado

327
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:06,917
for multiple homicide?

328
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:08,919
If only to rule him out.

329
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:12,920
Not only have we not found the perp
who killed M. Prado's little brother,

330
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,425
now you wanna investigate
his other brother for murder?

331
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:17,957
In a nutshell.

332
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:20,848
Can't ignore something
just 'cause it's messy.

333
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,180
- If I'm right, this is huge.
- And if you're wrong,

334
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,148
everyone involved
will be shitting blood

335
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:29,565
- due to acts I'd rather not describe.
- Thanks for that, Sarge.

336
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:32,696
I've got a gut feeling.

337
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:35,654
You wanna go to the lieutenant
with this?

338
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:37,979
I can't go to LaGuerta with this.

339
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:42,161
You follow up...

340
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,854
off the grid, and it's on you.

341
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:48,147
Thank you, Sarge.
Ramon's off duty tonight and tomorrow.

342
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:50,262
I'll set up on him,
see what shakes loose.

343
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,713
- If you need company...
- I've got it covered.

344
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:55,476
And try to be discreet, will you?

345
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:56,967
For a change?

346
00:21:32,243 --> 00:21:33,278
You came.

347
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:35,025
I also brought you these.

348
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:37,424
But it looks like
somebody beat me to it.

349
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:38,863
Oh, well...

350
00:21:39,651 --> 00:21:41,473
That new mom in maternity

351
00:21:42,395 --> 00:21:44,748
donated them to terminal care.

352
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,685
Talk about irony.

353
00:21:55,878 --> 00:21:57,292
You know, Dexter,

354
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,126
my whole life
I've been searching for...

355
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,208
The meaning of life?

356
00:22:08,168 --> 00:22:09,349
The perfect...

357
00:22:10,574 --> 00:22:12,076
Key lime pie.

358
00:22:13,521 --> 00:22:16,233
And what do I get
when I'm about to croak?

359
00:22:17,188 --> 00:22:19,063
Fucking pie crust,

360
00:22:19,746 --> 00:22:20,842
reddi wip,

361
00:22:21,464 --> 00:22:22,878
and green Jell-O.

362
00:22:23,785 --> 00:22:26,848
I'll see what I can do about finding you
the perfect key lime pie.

363
00:22:27,163 --> 00:22:28,840
You'd better do it fast.

364
00:22:30,992 --> 00:22:32,813
Next thing to go is the appetite.

365
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:43,708
Gene always

366
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,535
had this thing
about lighting my cigarette.

367
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:49,454
And he'd pass it to me...

368
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,769
before he lit his own.

369
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,228
Sweet, sweet man.

370
00:23:08,206 --> 00:23:10,392
Then it all caught up to him.

371
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,729
I watched him wither to a skeleton.

372
00:23:14,554 --> 00:23:16,589
My six foot tall,

373
00:23:17,233 --> 00:23:19,026
two hundred pound husband,

374
00:23:19,268 --> 00:23:21,097
shitting all over himself.

375
00:23:25,243 --> 00:23:27,305
His last breath was a mercy.

376
00:23:39,081 --> 00:23:40,641
Dying I can do.

377
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:43,352
Hell, I'm doing it.

378
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:46,285
The pain sure is a bear, though.

379
00:23:47,831 --> 00:23:48,831
How bad?

380
00:23:49,047 --> 00:23:51,349
The worst part
of the whole damn thing...

381
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:53,968
not losing my life...

382
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:57,397
My time on this earth...

383
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:00,580
Is losing my...

384
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:06,696
Dignity.

385
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:26,182
That fish was great.

386
00:24:26,547 --> 00:24:29,197
- You don't think Miguel overcooked it?
- A bit,

387
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:31,640
but the mango salsa saved the day.

388
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,354
So do you like what you do?
I mean, real estate.

389
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,689
I can't imagine doing anything else.

390
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,744
Yeah, I decided that losing my job
at the motel is not

391
00:24:45,094 --> 00:24:46,994
a bad thing but a good thing.

392
00:24:47,114 --> 00:24:48,671
So I'm looking around.

393
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:52,652
With your people skills,
you'd be great at real estate.

394
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:54,334
You think?

395
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:59,167
How about you start work tomorrow?

396
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:04,005
- I'm sorry, what?
- I need an assistant.

397
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:07,960
Having someone I can trust

398
00:25:08,229 --> 00:25:09,261
is everything.

399
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:13,152
<i>Salud.</i>

400
00:25:20,847 --> 00:25:23,900
Look, I've been giving a lot of thought
to this Clemson Galt thing.

401
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:26,546
Good.

402
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:28,405
<i>Dígame.</i>

403
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:34,161
What if we were to travel upstate
and arrange an interview with him?

404
00:25:34,406 --> 00:25:35,406
About?

405
00:25:36,514 --> 00:25:38,593
A career criminal
with a record like his,

406
00:25:38,713 --> 00:25:41,793
he's gotta be an encyclopedia of intel
on tons of other cases.

407
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:44,172
We would just need

408
00:25:44,937 --> 00:25:48,925
to get Galt alone long enough to make it
look like another prisoner did the deed.

409
00:25:49,692 --> 00:25:50,668
Last week,

410
00:25:50,931 --> 00:25:53,364
an inmate is found in a prison hallway

411
00:25:53,484 --> 00:25:55,953
drowned in a bucket of water.
This stuff

412
00:25:56,073 --> 00:25:58,639
happens all day long
in places like that.

413
00:26:00,823 --> 00:26:03,485
An inmate is found dead
in custody, Dexter,

414
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,775
be a lot of inquiries
and investigations.

415
00:26:05,935 --> 00:26:08,214
You got the bleeding hearts coming out
of the woodwork

416
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:09,945
whining about prison reform.

417
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,782
It doesn't sound like
much of a plan.

418
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:17,973
<i>That is the plan...</i>

419
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:20,884
<i>So that Miguel finally
includes himself out.</i>

420
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:22,196
But...

421
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:27,148
I'm in the middle of trying
a racketeering case right now.

422
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:29,038
Money laundering.

423
00:26:29,262 --> 00:26:31,760
The Aryans, they're masters
at moving cash around.

424
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:35,862
I subpoena Galt

425
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:37,606
as an expert witness,

426
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:40,931
corrections transports him
down here to testify.

427
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:43,010
Then Galt is within our reach.

428
00:26:44,117 --> 00:26:45,385
And on my turf.

429
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:50,529
Guessing it would take a long time
to set something like that up.

430
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:53,213
It would.

431
00:26:54,888 --> 00:26:56,618
But I've already issued
the subpoena.

432
00:26:57,785 --> 00:26:59,622
Galt'll be here tomorrow night.

433
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:00,672
Only...

434
00:27:01,308 --> 00:27:04,125
he's gonna be a no-show on
the witness stand the next morning.

435
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:07,170
Swing by the courthouse tomorrow,

436
00:27:08,196 --> 00:27:09,881
I'll walk you through
all the details.

437
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:14,536
Say thank you, Dexter.

438
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:18,293
<i>Miguel seems to have
way more aptitude</i>

439
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:20,392
<i>and appetite for this
than I ever imagined.</i>

440
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,604
<i>Just calling to check in.</i>

441
00:27:33,724 --> 00:27:35,740
Just having a look-see
in Ramon Prado's car.

442
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,742
- You really need to...
- Relax.

443
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:40,219
He's scarfing down his 2nd
plate of <i>arroz con póllo</i>

444
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:41,746
at a restaurant up the block.

445
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:44,435
He's got a wife and kids
at home, got the night off,

446
00:27:44,555 --> 00:27:46,167
so why is he eating alone?

447
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:50,452
Well, maybe the wife's
<i>arroz con póllo</i> isn't <i>póllo</i> enough.

448
00:27:51,431 --> 00:27:54,413
- You find anything interesting?
- A set of German steel filet knives,

449
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:57,720
a couple of straight razors,
and like 12 pounds of human skin.

450
00:27:58,282 --> 00:28:00,181
Just be careful
out there, will you?

451
00:28:00,907 --> 00:28:01,942
Yes, sir.

452
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,021
<i>Deb's got her mission.</i>

453
00:28:06,604 --> 00:28:07,843
<i>I've got mine.</i>

454
00:28:28,645 --> 00:28:31,775
I can get out and give you a great,
big hug so everyone can see

455
00:28:31,895 --> 00:28:34,758
what good friends we are...
Or you can talk to me.

456
00:28:36,018 --> 00:28:38,381
You know, after 12 hours
on surveillance detail,

457
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:42,011
- how about you blow me instead?
- I've been given the directive

458
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:44,684
to either step up my investigation
of Quinn or close it.

459
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:47,913
Because you haven't found dick.
If you weren't such a fuckwad,

460
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:50,106
I'd almost feel sorry for you
for working for IA.

461
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:53,068
- Where careers go to die.
- You need to get next to Quinn,

462
00:28:53,228 --> 00:28:55,873
be his go-to girl.
You'll be wearing a wire.

463
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,534
Are you on crack? How many times
have I told you to eat shit?

464
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,454
What the fuck makes you think
I'm suddenly willing to play now?

465
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:06,755
Because if you don't,
I'll put the word out

466
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,818
that you've been cooperating
all along.

467
00:29:08,938 --> 00:29:11,506
Everyone'll think
you're a rat anyway.

468
00:29:15,632 --> 00:29:17,759
Hard to believe even you
would sink that low.

469
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:29,231
So that door right over there?
Check this out.

470
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:31,764
That's supposed to be kept locked,

471
00:29:31,884 --> 00:29:33,175
and it never is.

472
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:36,454
The smokers use it
as a shortcut to get outside.

473
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:38,787
Shortcut to a shorter life.

474
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:42,534
You know, statistically, most escapes
happen out of a courthouse.

475
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:45,347
Security's a little bit more lax,

476
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:47,344
the defendant's wearing
a suit and a tie.

477
00:29:47,464 --> 00:29:49,582
It makes it easy for him
to just walk away.

478
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:52,043
Easier for us to cover our tracks.

479
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,229
That too.

480
00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:02,121
Must be good to be you.

481
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:03,521
Sometimes.

482
00:30:05,783 --> 00:30:07,433
Thanks for helping out.

483
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:20,277
Real reason she's blindfolded,

484
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:23,374
so she doesn't have to watch everything
she stands for get pissed on

485
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:24,868
by someone like Ellen Wolf.

486
00:30:25,745 --> 00:30:29,699
She had this client once who threw
a 5-year-old into an industrial washer

487
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:33,257
for talking dirty. She got him off
with 6 months in a mental hospital.

488
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:35,147
Diminished fucking capacity.

489
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:36,624
Hey.

490
00:30:37,455 --> 00:30:40,701
She probably got paid more that
than you took home in a year.

491
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:44,868
I gotta say I'm very disappointed
with your boss over there.

492
00:30:44,988 --> 00:30:46,884
I never thought that she,
of all people,

493
00:30:47,004 --> 00:30:50,193
would hurt me like this and throw in
with these fucking bottom-feeders.

494
00:30:50,313 --> 00:30:52,672
My dad used to say be careful
what you think you know

495
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:54,439
about someone.
You're probably wrong.

496
00:30:57,632 --> 00:30:58,638
Smart man.

497
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,758
Well, sometimes.

498
00:31:05,584 --> 00:31:07,093
I appreciate your...

499
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,245
cooperation in the deposition.

500
00:31:10,353 --> 00:31:12,890
I've never had a problem
telling the truth.

501
00:31:13,225 --> 00:31:14,225
We've got

502
00:31:14,836 --> 00:31:17,587
more than enough to get
the Hines conviction set aside.

503
00:31:17,982 --> 00:31:20,342
And you've set the stage
for your smear campaign

504
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,217
against a stand-up guy.
Nice.

505
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:27,120
You ever wanna hear
the unexpurgated version of your guy,

506
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,348
come find me, OK?

507
00:31:39,722 --> 00:31:41,027
Looks like a church.

508
00:31:44,847 --> 00:31:46,658
The holding cell
is through that door.

509
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:51,592
Connects to a hallway,
then goes out to a parking garage.

510
00:31:51,712 --> 00:31:54,565
On your right,
there's gonna be an emergency exit.

511
00:31:54,685 --> 00:31:56,793
And that deadbolt
is gonna be taped...

512
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,682
Open.

513
00:31:59,974 --> 00:32:01,282
Why risk it all?

514
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,691
Your career, reputation, freedom.

515
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,799
You could just walk away.

516
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:09,820
You didn't walk away
from Ethan Turner.

517
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,940
Because you understand, Dexter,
that we're living in...

518
00:32:15,823 --> 00:32:17,877
We're living in crucial times

519
00:32:17,997 --> 00:32:20,300
that demand extraordinary measures.

520
00:32:21,895 --> 00:32:23,236
<i>Miguel's convinced himself</i>

521
00:32:23,396 --> 00:32:26,694
<i>he wants this kill tonight
for lofty and noble reasons.</i>

522
00:32:27,018 --> 00:32:28,855
<i>I'm not quite as high-minded.</i>

523
00:32:28,975 --> 00:32:30,868
You didn't answer my question.

524
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,399
Asshole drunk dad...

525
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:37,417
Maybe I'm trying to clean up the mess
that I couldn't as a kid, I don't know.

526
00:32:40,102 --> 00:32:43,256
Come on, I'll show you where
you're gonna be hooking up with Galt.

527
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,380
What's the hurry?
You meeting someone?

528
00:32:54,803 --> 00:32:56,653
More like avoiding someone.

529
00:32:56,786 --> 00:32:59,606
This is me not telling you
I'm tailing Ramon Prado again tonight.

530
00:32:59,766 --> 00:33:02,334
Well, this is me not hearing
a word you're saying.

531
00:33:02,454 --> 00:33:04,302
I'm also unofficially
and off the record

532
00:33:04,422 --> 00:33:06,919
telling you to be smart
and watch your ass.

533
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:09,993
'Scuse me, officer.

534
00:33:10,243 --> 00:33:12,169
Sergeant. How can I help you?

535
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:13,855
I was just...

536
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:17,036
released for this legal thing.

537
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,592
- You were arrested.
- And released.

538
00:33:19,842 --> 00:33:21,381
Totally victimless.

539
00:33:21,631 --> 00:33:24,154
Only I live like
a million miles away from here,

540
00:33:24,404 --> 00:33:26,004
and I really need a ride.

541
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:28,923
How 'bout the bus?

542
00:33:29,673 --> 00:33:31,915
How 'bout you take me home

543
00:33:32,165 --> 00:33:34,888
and I think of some victimless
way of saying thank you?

544
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:47,400
I'll have dispatch call you a cab.

545
00:33:48,515 --> 00:33:49,569
Just like that?

546
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:51,195
Just like that.

547
00:34:11,355 --> 00:34:13,926
Sergeant, Barbara Gianna here.

548
00:34:15,063 --> 00:34:17,130
So happens...

549
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:18,973
I'm hungry.

550
00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:22,766
<i>Hungry enough to--
to see if you are too.</i>

551
00:34:23,016 --> 00:34:24,979
Are you asking me out
on a date, detective?

552
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:27,707
I don't date, sergeant.

553
00:34:27,957 --> 00:34:28,858
Ever.

554
00:34:29,343 --> 00:34:31,889
<i>Marino's Trattoria, 7:30?</i>

555
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,822
Aren't you gonna ask me
if I really turned over a new leaf?

556
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:38,154
<i>It could be I'm just not
partial to redheads.</i>

557
00:34:38,404 --> 00:34:40,995
I have no idea what
you're talking about, detective.

558
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:43,164
I'll see you at 7:30.

559
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,962
Delivered fresh daily
from a little bakery

560
00:34:50,212 --> 00:34:51,631
down in Key Largo.

561
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:56,386
- Supposed to be the best in the Keys.
- Well, it's not.

562
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:58,680
Pardon my bluntness, but...

563
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,569
this pie is green.

564
00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:02,850
Means they used food coloring.

565
00:35:03,336 --> 00:35:05,561
Something purists frown on?

566
00:35:05,811 --> 00:35:08,189
Which I'd be doing right now,
except even my face hurts.

567
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:11,734
The other thing they fucked up--

568
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,425
this wasn't made
with condensed milk.

569
00:35:15,298 --> 00:35:17,411
No, it's fresh and organic.

570
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:20,914
Only they didn't have
fresh milk in the Keys

571
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:22,203
back in the day.

572
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:28,362
Here comes Miss Morphy.

573
00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:32,046
Bringer of bad dreams
and less pain.

574
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:39,762
If you're as serious
about key lime pie as I am...

575
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:45,077
you can do better.

576
00:35:49,718 --> 00:35:51,158
<i>Tonight's the night.</i>

577
00:35:51,408 --> 00:35:52,799
<i>But it feels different.</i>

578
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:54,318
<i>I won't be alone.</i>

579
00:35:54,568 --> 00:35:56,365
<i>Uncharted territory for me...</i>

580
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:58,226
<i>Not without risk.</i>

581
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,825
<i>And strangely exhilarating.</i>

582
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,645
So what do you think?

583
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:06,080
Best pizza night ever.

584
00:36:07,926 --> 00:36:10,126
No, I meant about Syl's job offer.

585
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:14,172
If real estate's something
you're interested in, go for it.

586
00:36:14,783 --> 00:36:16,887
And Syl's great at what she does.

587
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:19,514
In a market this bad,
she's still always closing.

588
00:36:19,723 --> 00:36:21,804
And I could learn a lot. I just...

589
00:36:23,036 --> 00:36:23,764
But...

590
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:29,077
What if I...

591
00:36:29,327 --> 00:36:31,105
see a side to her
that I don't like?

592
00:36:31,855 --> 00:36:34,734
That's the risk you run when you go
into business with somebody,

593
00:36:35,415 --> 00:36:36,819
especially a friend.

594
00:36:38,002 --> 00:36:40,526
Makes things more complicated,
no doubt about it.

595
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:41,849
Still...

596
00:36:42,616 --> 00:36:44,994
without my friend Syl,
I wouldn't have this opportunity.

597
00:36:46,043 --> 00:36:48,122
So I think I'm gonna

598
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,428
take the risk
and jump in with both feet

599
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:54,087
and see if this new thing
calls to me.

600
00:36:58,623 --> 00:37:00,176
It's getting late.

601
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,847
You don't wanna stay?

602
00:37:02,352 --> 00:37:05,473
Miguel and I have a...
early morning run.

603
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,049
I can sleep in longer
if I stay at my place.

604
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:10,061
Don't be surprised
if he's a no-show.

605
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,272
What makes you say that?

606
00:37:13,937 --> 00:37:15,691
He's been a complete wreck lately.

607
00:37:16,646 --> 00:37:17,860
Not sleeping,

608
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,571
terrible mood. Syl thinks
something's really bothering him.

609
00:37:21,596 --> 00:37:22,865
Seemed fine today.

610
00:37:23,222 --> 00:37:25,451
You may be his buddy,
but you're not his wife.

611
00:37:26,021 --> 00:37:28,788
And besides, it's not like you can
hide anything from your partner.

612
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:31,032
So true.

613
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:33,768
Why would you want to?

614
00:37:37,971 --> 00:37:40,732
<i>Looks like Miguel's got a bad
case of nerves about tonight.</i>

615
00:37:40,982 --> 00:37:43,111
<i>He isn't sleeping
like a baby anymore.</i>

616
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,105
If you're gonna bail off of this,

617
00:37:45,355 --> 00:37:46,889
now would be a good time.

618
00:37:48,043 --> 00:37:49,767
What are you
dressed like that for?

619
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,020
The more the merrier.

620
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:57,579
Why don't we swing by
and pick up Rita and the kids?

621
00:37:59,225 --> 00:38:00,912
Bring them along too.

622
00:38:03,468 --> 00:38:05,366
What makes you think
you can count on Miguel?

623
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:08,828
He's just a little jumpy.
He's new at this.

624
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:12,540
Mark my words, he'll give you up
in a heartbeat to save his own ass.

625
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:14,500
This is not a guy

626
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,791
who wants to spend the rest
of his life in a cage.

627
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:19,331
Just one more thing Miguel
and I have in common.

628
00:38:20,343 --> 00:38:22,517
You don't know
what you're getting into.

629
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,619
You've never had to rely
on anyone else before, Dexter.

630
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:29,390
Because you taught me
loneliness as an art form.

631
00:38:30,353 --> 00:38:31,412
But guess what?

632
00:38:31,662 --> 00:38:33,307
I finally have a life

633
00:38:33,957 --> 00:38:35,980
with a family and now a friend...

634
00:38:36,793 --> 00:38:38,067
who I trust.

635
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:41,566
We only see two things in people...

636
00:38:42,707 --> 00:38:45,615
What we wanna see
and what they wanna show us.

637
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,937
You don't know Miguel
any more than he knows you.

638
00:38:48,104 --> 00:38:50,458
You aren't seriously gonna
lecture me on relationships

639
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:53,365
after the debris field
you left behind.

640
00:38:56,423 --> 00:38:58,789
No matter how close two people are,

641
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:01,377
an infinite distance separates them.

642
00:39:03,295 --> 00:39:04,763
Look at you and me.

643
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,254
Mind if I get
a picture with you, <i>jefe</i>?

644
00:39:16,504 --> 00:39:17,774
You got a cam--

645
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:34,220
Any truth you're gonna
run for D.A.?

646
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,965
- If I do, I'm gonna need your support.
- You got it, <i>jefe</i>.

647
00:39:43,654 --> 00:39:45,057
Thanks, officer.

648
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:57,395
You listen to me, pulled pork.

649
00:39:58,154 --> 00:40:00,356
I got no clue why the fuck
you dragged me down here

650
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,448
but you can suck my white dick,

651
00:40:02,698 --> 00:40:04,902
you think I'm helping
your spic ass with shit.

652
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,326
This all ends right here,
right now, Clemson.

653
00:40:14,814 --> 00:40:15,955
This makes us even.

654
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,301
When you walk out the door,

655
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,303
one of your Nazi pals is waiting
for you in the parking garage.

656
00:40:32,372 --> 00:40:33,597
From now on,

657
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,852
all of the threats to my family,
they stop, understand?

658
00:40:48,862 --> 00:40:51,490
I knew my Aryan brothers
would come through, <i>ése</i>.

659
00:41:09,348 --> 00:41:10,937
Have any arrangements been made

660
00:41:11,104 --> 00:41:14,060
in case this guy's testimony runs long
and he has to stay another day?

661
00:41:14,227 --> 00:41:16,433
We're holding a spot in protective
at Miami-Dade.

662
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,298
My good man. Appreciate it.

663
00:41:24,428 --> 00:41:27,240
I got a witness in there, man,
that's taking a nap.

664
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,952
I'm gonna really need him fresh
for court in a couple of hours.

665
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,899
I gotta put a county wristband on him.
Just take a second.

666
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,516
Clem Galt.

667
00:41:48,237 --> 00:41:49,530
I'm your wheel man.

668
00:41:50,867 --> 00:41:52,370
Welcome home.

669
00:41:53,406 --> 00:41:55,137
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

670
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,114
- Let's get outta here.
- This way.

671
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,266
Have ya outta the country
by lunchtime.

672
00:42:01,206 --> 00:42:03,950
- What's going on here?
- I don't know. Come on.

673
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:11,445
I'll get ya outta here.

674
00:42:11,806 --> 00:42:14,657
Galt had to have an accomplice.
Just set up a perimeter

675
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,909
around this building.
No one gets in or out.

676
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:20,538
- Fucking spic set us up.
- This guy cannot get away!

677
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,553
- And I'm gonna return the favor.
- That's mighty white of you.

678
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,298
Galt's right. He's selling you out.

679
00:42:34,548 --> 00:42:37,319
Never underestimate
the capacity of other people

680
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:40,343
- to let you down.
- It's not the time, dad.

681
00:42:44,944 --> 00:42:46,480
There he goes.

682
00:42:46,945 --> 00:42:48,845
Looking out for number one.

683
00:42:49,412 --> 00:42:51,610
Which is what you should have done.

684
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:59,468
Like the man said,

685
00:42:59,922 --> 00:43:01,536
nobody gets in or out.

686
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:10,671
Might as well give up.
No sense risking death by cop.

687
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,091
You keep Miguel's involvement secret,
he might let you off with a few years.

688
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,259
Stop.

689
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:18,095
Unless they find those blood slides
when they toss your apartment.

690
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,314
Stop!

691
00:43:41,326 --> 00:43:43,336
I'm gonna drop you off at your car.

692
00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:45,581
Then I'll meet you
at the stash house

693
00:43:46,149 --> 00:43:48,372
as soon as I can get outta here.

694
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,128
- Wait for me, huh?
- Thanks for this.

695
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,380
That's what friends are for.

696
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,965
I'm gonna do a loop around the building
until you get more backup here.

697
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:00,846
You got it, <i>jefe</i>.

698
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:15,402
Gimme a fucking break, Ramon.

699
00:44:17,724 --> 00:44:18,614
Don't lie!

700
00:44:40,174 --> 00:44:42,179
You can make this stop right now...

701
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,806
If you tell me where he is.

702
00:44:44,085 --> 00:44:45,629
I don't know.

703
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,234
You're making this
very hard on yourself, Felipe.

704
00:45:00,551 --> 00:45:04,489
- You scared the fuckmother out of me.
- You called me. What do we got?

705
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:07,121
Kidnapping, for starters.

706
00:45:07,595 --> 00:45:09,250
Who's the special guest?

707
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,833
That's Felipe Cepeda.

708
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:13,961
One of Freebo's hemp suppliers.
I questioned him 2 weeks ago.

709
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:17,116
Now Ramon's got a few
questions of his own.

710
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:20,092
Well, so far, I've only heard one--
Where's Freebo?

711
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,806
I'm just waiting
for the skinning to start.

712
00:45:25,585 --> 00:45:28,146
- Tell me where he is.
- I don't know!

713
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:39,820
Nothing like a nice cold
soda pop before a good skinning.

714
00:45:46,528 --> 00:45:49,384
- Fuck, that's gotta hurt.
- Wait, wait.

715
00:45:49,634 --> 00:45:51,331
We need to be sure
he's the skinner.

716
00:46:00,983 --> 00:46:02,676
You have some answers
for me now?

717
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,285
I don't get it.
That's not the skinner's M.O.

718
00:46:10,452 --> 00:46:12,061
Maybe he's just warming up.

719
00:46:19,058 --> 00:46:20,152
Here he goes...

720
00:46:36,144 --> 00:46:37,336
He's not the skinner.

721
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:02,269
I gotta take this.
Don't go anywhere.

722
00:47:04,824 --> 00:47:08,366
So Ramon Prado's a sick fuck,
but he's not the one we're looking for.

723
00:47:10,234 --> 00:47:12,841
I'll talk to you about it
over breakfast. I gotta go.

724
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:14,226
What's up?

725
00:47:15,492 --> 00:47:17,876
So, why are you calling us
in at midnight?

726
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,630
We've picked up
Ramon Prado.

727
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:24,049
He's... outside.

728
00:47:24,534 --> 00:47:26,802
We got a unit watching him
to keep his mouth shut.

729
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:30,431
For what?

730
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,434
Kidnapping.
False imprisonment.

731
00:47:34,483 --> 00:47:35,936
And torture.

732
00:47:42,454 --> 00:47:45,154
- Are you sure?
- We witnessed it ourselves.

733
00:47:48,852 --> 00:47:49,849
My god, I--

734
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:51,827
We can't give him a pass on this.

735
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:56,874
No, we can't.

736
00:48:01,498 --> 00:48:03,380
Thank you for being
politic at least.

737
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,224
I woulda perp-walked him
right through here.

738
00:48:07,413 --> 00:48:10,304
Morgan insisted we be discreet
out of respect for his family.

739
00:48:16,357 --> 00:48:18,353
Were you aware
of this investigation?

740
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:21,607
- Yes, I was.
- And you didn't inform me?

741
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:25,152
I wanted something solid
before involving you.

742
00:48:27,601 --> 00:48:29,127
Thank you for that.

743
00:48:31,032 --> 00:48:33,243
You handled a tough
situation the smart way.

744
00:48:34,504 --> 00:48:37,748
- How do you wanna do this?
- Book him.

745
00:48:38,994 --> 00:48:41,044
I'll notify the family.

746
00:48:48,812 --> 00:48:50,260
That went well.

747
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:02,218
Internal affairs
is investigating you.

748
00:49:05,103 --> 00:49:05,943
What?

749
00:49:06,148 --> 00:49:08,403
They've been giving me a sandpaper
enema to wear a wire.

750
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,239
This has been going
on for a while.

751
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,345
- And you're finally telling me.
- Yes.

752
00:49:12,512 --> 00:49:15,619
Do you wanna tell me why this I.A. chick
is so gung ho to bring you down?

753
00:49:17,441 --> 00:49:18,327
Wait.

754
00:49:18,577 --> 00:49:21,208
Does this I.A. chick
go by the name of Yuki Amado?

755
00:49:22,081 --> 00:49:23,752
As a matter of fact, yes.

756
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,741
You wanna tell me what's going on?

757
00:49:27,861 --> 00:49:30,147
Yuki and I have a... history.

758
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,762
It's a totally personal vendetta
on her part.

759
00:49:35,685 --> 00:49:38,962
I'll handle it.
I appreciate the heads up, though.

760
00:49:53,714 --> 00:49:57,637
Even in prison, I'm sure you heard about
the big slump in the real estate market.

761
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:02,708
What the fuck...

762
00:50:08,452 --> 00:50:11,342
There is an upside
to the downturn, though.

763
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,552
Plenty of empty houses.

764
00:50:17,437 --> 00:50:19,505
Do you recognize this one?

765
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:22,185
It's where you killed
Jenna Kendrick.

766
00:50:22,702 --> 00:50:24,688
No idea what the hell
you're talking about.

767
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:28,358
I'm talking about
hammer time, Clemson.

768
00:50:32,016 --> 00:50:34,573
You got me mixed up
with somebody else.

769
00:50:45,097 --> 00:50:47,753
You can't imagine how much
I've been looking forward to this.

770
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,465
And none of it

771
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,901
would be happening

772
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:55,097
if it weren't for my...

773
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:56,462
friend

774
00:50:57,469 --> 00:50:59,645
Miguel Prado.
You remember him?

775
00:51:00,466 --> 00:51:02,100
He really came through tonight.

776
00:51:03,153 --> 00:51:04,853
In a big way.

777
00:51:08,491 --> 00:51:10,025
<i>I never had a partner before.</i>

778
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,593
<i>I had my doubts initially,
but everything worked out.</i>

779
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,533
<i>But this part, the ritual...</i>

780
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:21,753
<i>The connection and certainty...</i>

781
00:51:22,475 --> 00:51:24,539
<i>followed by that
pristine silence...</i>

782
00:51:27,498 --> 00:51:28,949
<i>is for me.</i>

783
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,384
<i>And me alone.</i>

784
00:51:52,247 --> 00:51:53,694
<i>Miguel will be disappointed.</i>

785
00:51:55,368 --> 00:51:58,323
<i>I'll explain to him I took Galt
straight to the cemetery</i>

786
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:01,535
<i>and dumped him in a grave
after the screw-up at the courthouse.</i>

787
00:52:03,129 --> 00:52:07,249
<i>Truth is, I'm not ready to share this
part of me with anyone else just yet.</i>

788
00:52:09,337 --> 00:52:10,752
<i>Present company excepted.</i>

789
00:52:13,483 --> 00:52:15,928
<i>I'm not sure I ever will be ready.</i>

790
00:52:21,686 --> 00:52:23,584
<i>Even if Miguel senses my deception,</i>

791
00:52:23,834 --> 00:52:26,445
<i>he'll forgive me
this one small untruth.</i>

792
00:52:34,462 --> 00:52:36,197
<i>How can I be so sure?</i>

793
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:42,969
<i>Because after tonight,</i>

794
00:52:43,178 --> 00:52:45,072
<i>I can honestly say</i>

795
00:52:45,322 --> 00:52:48,475
<i>I know who Miguel Prado
really is...</i>

796
00:52:49,522 --> 00:52:51,816
<i>My first good friend.</i>

797
00:52:53,747 --> 00:52:56,561
<i>And those are in short
supply these days.</i>
