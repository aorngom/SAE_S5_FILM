1
00:00:01,269 --> 00:00:04,039
The following story is fictional
and does not depict any actual person or event

2
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,080
You really want to help the
governor pardon a murderer?

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,500
The guy killed a cop.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,670
He started the most
vicious Latino gang in DC.

5
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,920
Manny Trillo is the original gangster.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,290
He is responsible for
half the crack trade in DC.

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,790
Guys like that don't change.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,750
Not generally,no.

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,000
Which is why this
case is so interesting.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,200
You have a visitor.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,700
Lieutenant Governor Goldin.

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,590
I hear he's bringing friends.

13
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,440
<i>Hey,lambache.</i>

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,250
<i>You going to kiss the
governor's ass again or what,ese?</i>

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,970
<i>Pucker up,ese.</i>

16
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,860
Dr. Lightman.

17
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,730
I'm Lieutenant Governor Goldin.

18
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,230
Mr. Trillo's on his way.

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,860
The governor really wants to make him

20
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,540
the poster boy for early release?

21
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,210
Manny Trillo was up for a Nobel Prize

22
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,080
for the antigang work he's done in here.

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,400
We believe he can do
even more on the outside.

24
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,120
Well,one in every 100
Americans is in prison.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,500
Can understand why the governor
wants him for a poster boy,right?

26
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,620
GOLDIN: Of course, before
we issue any pardon,

27
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,210
the governor wants to make sure
Mr. Trillo is truly rehabilitated.

28
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,420
That's why you're here.

29
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,220
I think you should get him out of there.

30
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,460
Excuse me? Get him
out of there right now.

31
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,920
Get down... get down on the ground!

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,760
Get down on the ground right now.

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,850
Stay down.

37
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,130
You know,I treated a few
firefighters in grad school.

38
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,180
It's amazing what these
guys have to deal with.

39
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,880
You got a bit of a fireman thing,huh?

40
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,800
I'm just saying these guys are heroes.

41
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,400
Is it the helmets?

42
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,500
I mean,even I like the helmets.

43
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,530
Dr. Foster?

44
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,050
I'm Mike Adams with the
National Fire Safety Board.

45
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,340
Hi. Hi.

46
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,790
Is that for the firefighter
who was killed last week?

47
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,830
Yeah.

48
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,700
Eric Mitchell.

49
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,060
Had less than a year on the job.

50
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,970
His grandfather served for 30
years in the 23rd Engine Company.

51
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,590
He stops by almost every day.

52
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,530
Mr. Mitchell.

53
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,090
These are the people from that
firm I was telling you about.

54
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,320
Well,I'm glad someone is trying to
find out what really happened to my boy.

55
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,150
I'm sorry about your grandson.

56
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,900
This just couldn't
have been an accident.

57
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,300
We're going to do everything we can to
figure out what happened, Mr. Mitchell.

58
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,720
So,that's what it takes
to get the feds involved.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,280
Grieving relative.

60
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,310
We investigate any time a
firefighter's killed on the job.

61
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,610
The building fire was a bad one,

62
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,930
<i>a two-alarm blaze.</i>

63
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,460
<i>Eric Mitchell and his company
went in, did a preliminary sweep.</i>

64
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,040
<i>Now,Eric came out with a kid.</i>

65
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,190
<i>Then,he headed back in.</i>

66
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,320
The company got separated.

67
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,850
They didn't find Eric's body
until they'd put out the fire.

68
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,460
So,the fire didn't kill him?

69
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,700
The coroner couldn't
find a cause of death.

70
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,780
Eric's burns had no inflamed edges.

71
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,220
He was dead before the
fire even got to him.

72
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,180
It's unusual,

73
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,720
and it raises the possibility
that another firefighter killed him

74
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,730
and left him there to burn.

75
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,390
I hired you because if someone is lying

76
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,500
about what happened in
that fire,I need to know.

77
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,710
That won't be easy.

78
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,860
A firehouse is a behavioral in-group.

79
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,990
They become more cohesive
in the face of adversity.

80
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,790
Is that so?

81
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,940
Chief Morrow, Lieutenant Clayton.

82
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,600
You know, that shrink mumbo jumbo

83
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,330
won't get you far with our boys.

84
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,290
That's why I won't be
interviewing the men.

85
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,730
Dr. Lightman will be
conducting the interviews?

86
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,680
No,no, we'll get the most
deception leakage from these firemen

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,850
if they're interviewed by
someone that they respect.

88
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,520
So,we won't be asking the questions.

89
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,490
You will.

90
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,240
Name? David Caddick.

91
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,760
And how long have you
been a firefighter?

92
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,730
Eight years.

93
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,480
Anything notable?

94
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,480
Well,Caddick's okay,

95
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,400
but Clayton is biting his
lip, tugging at his ear.

96
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,390
He's showing an
increase in manipulators.

97
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,530
It's a sign of anxiety.

98
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,810
The lieutenant's nervous?

99
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,640
Yeah,it's normal.

100
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,890
He's already lost one man.

101
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,480
Last thing he wants to
do is indict another.

102
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,490
Tell us about the fire.

103
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,470
Our truck,Truck 5, responded right away.

104
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,120
We started searching.

105
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,260
We followed procedure.

106
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,240
One man on the wall, human chain.

107
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,800
Wall comes down.

108
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,680
Screaming across the hall.

109
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,050
Suddenly,we're all in
different directions.

110
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,150
We split up.

111
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,890
I was low on oxygen,

112
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,390
so I cleared a couple of
rooms, and then I hit the door.

113
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,610
And I didn't see Eric again.

114
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,500
I got down the hall.

115
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,100
Found an exit.

116
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,100
I didn't see Eric again.

117
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,350
I checked the stairwell.

118
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,630
I left the building.

119
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,840
I didn't see Eric again.

120
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,750
Their stories were consistent.

121
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:12,980
They were.

122
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,830
Can you pull up the
response latency analysis?

123
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,940
Response latency?

124
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,940
It's the time between when a question
is asked and the answer is given.

125
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,250
Tell us about the fire.

126
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,110
Alarm went off at 3:00 A.M.

127
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,620
CLAYTON: Tell us about the fire.

128
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,100
We got the call around 3:00 A.M.

129
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Tell us about the fire.

130
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,210
Must have been about
3:00 in the morning.

131
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,000
FOSTER: Response time is under a second.

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,100
If they were lying,
they'd be longer,right?

133
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,290
A lot of people think you take
longer to respond if you're lying,

134
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,650
but that's just if
the lie is spontaneous.

135
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,170
If a lie is prepared ahead of time,

136
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,610
you're eager to get it over with.

137
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,570
So,which one of them is lying?

138
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:45,850
They all are.

139
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,090
Something happened in that fire,

140
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,530
and from the looks of it,

141
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,450
every one of them was involved.

142
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,450
<i>GOLDIN: This was the second attempton
Manny Trillo's life this month.</i>

143
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Tensions between La Salva

144
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,700
and Trillo's old gang have escalated.

145
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,950
Trillo's been speaking out.

146
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,440
A lot of guys want him dead.

147
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,610
The only thing worse
than the street violence

148
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,600
we'll see if Trillo is killed in prison

149
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,250
is the violence we'll see if
he takes over El Punio again.

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,400
The governor believes Trillo's changed.

151
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,970
He thinks he could do some
real good on the outside,

152
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,470
but we need to know
he's telling the truth,

153
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,620
that he's not going back to gang life.

154
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,630
All right.

155
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,370
More than happy to put
my reputation on the line.

156
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,160
First couple of years here, I was angry,

157
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,990
so I took on the other prisoners.

158
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,240
I took on the guards.

159
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,010
I did a lot of solitary.

160
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,260
Got so bad,

161
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,660
I started stealing books from the
prison library and carrying them around.

162
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,360
I wouldn't have picked
you for a bookworm.

163
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,800
That much time in the hole...

164
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,640
I read anything I could got my hands on.

165
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,600
Gardening manuals, economic textbooks,

166
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,920
Spanish poetry.

167
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,310
"There is no cry of pain
without,at its end, an echo of joy."

168
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,110
Ramn de Campoamor.

169
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,000
I read that and...

170
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,490
I don't know.

171
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,830
I caused so much pain.

172
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,980
What joy could come from that?

173
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,050
And then,I'd realized...

174
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,260
I had to be the joy.

175
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,340
That's a charming story.

176
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,920
Would you mind?

177
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,610
I missed lunch.

178
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,790
So,you're saying that
you regret what you did.

179
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,830
All I cared about was
the power,the money.

180
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,180
And I took a life.

181
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,860
Just the one?

182
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,830
I ruined the lives
of many young Latinos,

183
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,830
kids who could have had a chance.

184
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,250
Do you have any... plans,

185
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,950
you know,for after prison?

186
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,490
I have a plan for street peace.

187
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,280
We need a social agenda for the barrio.

188
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,620
I've been stabbed twice the last month.

189
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,530
15 stitches this morning.

190
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,850
My life is in your hands.

191
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,410
I couldn't agree more.

192
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,498
Do you think it might be helpful to
clue me into your little experiments?

193
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,554
Nope. 

194
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:58,269
Gang leaders like Trillo learn
early that respect is key to survival.

195
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,680
They need to respond
to perceived disrespect,

196
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,470
and it becomes what we
call an emotional trigger.

197
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,900
He needs me to believe
that he's reformed,

198
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,030
but when I talk to
him with my mouth full,

199
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,100
this is what we get.

200
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,040
Nostrils flared.

201
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,790
Lips tightened.

202
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,770
Anger.

203
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,310
He can't control himself.

204
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,940
Disrespect is still a trigger.

205
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,810
You're saying Trillo hasn't changed.

206
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,870
Not necessarily.

207
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,610
When he talks about his past,

208
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,360
he shows us something else.

209
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,350
And I took a life.

210
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,250
Shame.

211
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
He's truly ashamed for what he's done.

212
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,870
Yeah,but the anger trigger... No.

213
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,090
That's a survival trigger,

214
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,000
and they're really hard to turn off.

215
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,310
Doesn't mean he hasn't changed.

216
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,170
You need to compare this to an
emotional baseline-- old videos.

217
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,330
Call the governor's office

218
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,920
and see if they have
anything they can send over.

219
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,990
Preferably before someone sticks
another fork in Mr. Trillo.

220
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,440
Yeah.

221
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,890
No problem.

222
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,250
You see that?

223
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,610
You think you made the right
call putting her on this case?

224
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,770
Well,who wouldn't want
to be on this case?

225
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,030
Evolution generally takes millennia,

226
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,700
but change in a lifetime,now...

227
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,360
that's something to see.

228
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,710
All the naturals that we have seen,

229
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,390
they share two traits.

230
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,000
They are uneducated and...

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,140
And the other trait should have nothing to do with
the scientific question of whether a man can evolve.

232
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,040
Yes, but psychologically,if she
has dealt with a history of...

233
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,530
Hey,if she has strong
feelings about Trillo,

234
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,430
then she has to learn to put them aside.

235
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,510
Oh,so I guess, if someone's got to
teach her how to avoid her feelings,

236
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,500
then you're the most qualified.

237
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,240
Anything else I can do for you?

238
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,840
I do need some help with
my,uh,my firefighters.

239
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,730
Well,all three firemen
showed increased manipulators,

240
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,850
but only two of them showed
micro expressions of fear.

241
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,550
Well,take me through the
one that didn't show fear.

242
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,760
Uh,I thought we were looking for the guy

243
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,210
most likely to tell us what happened.

244
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:02,920
We are.

245
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,910
Okay. Doug Donovan.

246
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,010
No increased anxiety,
no notable signs of...

247
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,030
Oh,stop it there.

248
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,580
Take it three seconds back.

249
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,990
Freeze it there.

250
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,180
Cheeks raised,

251
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,970
lip corners depressed...

252
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,030
Remorse.

253
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,970
Maybe he knows something.

254
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,300
Maybe the group is forcing him to lie.

255
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,050
Well,he's the one you want to focus on.

256
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,630
Monkey with the interview conditions.

257
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,960
Keep him with someone he respects.

258
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,240
Use the chief. The more
guilty the kid feels,

259
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,710
the more likely he is to
tell you what he knows.

260
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,290
Training drill,

261
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,910
1500 Beecham Drive.

262
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,800
Truck 5,go,go,go!

263
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,130
All right,men.

264
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,735
We have a fire on the second floor.

265
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:54,924
asdfasd

266
00:12:55,144 --> 00:12:57,640
And don't lose touch of
the man in front of you.

267
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,040
Probie,get back in line!

268
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,440
Wallace,take over.

269
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,380
Probie!

270
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,750
Probie!

271
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,460
Probie!

272
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,410
Chief Morrow?

273
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,090
What the...?

274
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,580
Didn't work out like
this for Mitchell,did it?

275
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,290
You saved the chief.

276
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,650
Why didn't you save him?

277
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,120
You're not the type of
guy to leave a man behind.

278
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,870
Hey,we know how guilty you feel.

279
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,420
There must be a good reason you lied.

280
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,090
Come on.

281
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,360
Why won't you tell us what happened?

282
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,830
I left him.

283
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,080
I found him in the fire.

284
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,820
I'm supposed to pull him out.

285
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,200
The flames had already got to him,

286
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,130
but I'm supposed to pull him out.

287
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,040
I'm just as guilty as those other guys.

288
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,180
What other guys?

289
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,810
The ones who were hazing him.

290
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,330
According to Mr. Donovan,

291
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,820
your men have been involved in
some pretty extensive hazing.

292
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,370
He wouldn't say who was involved,

293
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,050
but it went beyond the silent treatment.

294
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,600
Baking soda showers,

295
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,670
bottle rockets in the bathroom stalls...

296
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,580
Did you know Eric Mitchell
had a severe peanut allergy?

297
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,370
No,I didn't.

298
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,880
Donovan heard that slipping Mitchell
a little PB&J was the next big gag.

299
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,760
Well,he's junior. He
wasn't one of the hazers,

300
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,700
but that's why he didn't
pull Eric's body out.

301
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,060
He was protecting the men.

302
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,020
He thought that they had killed Eric.

303
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,570
Were you aware of what was going on?

304
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,420
Hazing is as much a part
of this life as alarm bells.

305
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,190
And if one of your men goes
into anaphylactic shock and dies,

306
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,290
<i>c'est la vie?</i>

307
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,040
You don't understand,

308
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,190
but when you're trapped
inside a burning building,

309
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,420
you got to know that the other guys

310
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,310
are going to put code before cowardice,

311
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,320
walk through a wall of
fire and come get you.

312
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,090
He's right.

313
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,400
I need men who are willing to
risk their lives on a daily basis.

314
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,280
And Mitchell just didn't have it in him.

315
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,700
So you looked the other way?

316
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,860
He needed to learn.

317
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,230
But make no mistake about it,

318
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,510
I demand a certain level
of respect out of my men.

319
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,920
There's a line.

320
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,650
And they wouldn't have crossed it.

321
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,220
Then you won't mind if we talk
to the other men in the company?

322
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,570
No.

323
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,710
Kerry-- the chief's
niece-- she'll help you out.

324
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,770
I got real work to do.

325
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,260
It's like they never
left the frat house.

326
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,140
You know,it's not just frat houses.

327
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,610
Initiation rites can be
found in all major cultures.

328
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,760
You're defending these guys?

329
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,400
Hazing can serve an important
psychological function.

330
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,860
Oh,that's funny.

331
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,590
I don't remember reading any articles
in the APA journal on swirlies.

332
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,440
Initiation for you MIT mathletes
was pretty hard-core,huh?

333
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,320
You make fun,but you try waking up in
a shower stall with a killer hangover

334
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,880
and a quart of macaroni
salad shoved up your...

335
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,080
What?

336
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,410
t her self-hushing emblem.

337
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,820
She knows something.

338
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,150
Yeah,she does.

339
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,190
And she's hushing herself

340
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,070
because part of her wants to tell.

341
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,350
I knew he was hiding a badge.

342
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,600
<i>La policia siempre asi.</i>

343
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,710
Shield don't make no difference to me.

344
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,520
<i>Chota got what he deserved.</i>

345
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,600
Making any headway with
the old Trillo videos?

346
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,430
Not really.

347
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,850
No evidence of emotional change at all?

348
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,130
Trillo doesn't seem all
that different to me.

349
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,880
Let's run the tape.

350
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,780
I've been watching video surveillance
from before Trillo's arrest.

351
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,180
That's good.
Natural habitat--

352
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,110
that's the best baseline.

353
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,630
All right...

354
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,260
Let's drop the sound
and run it side by side

355
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,040
with the video we shot
at the penitentiary.

356
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,240
Anger. Contempt.

357
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,620
Contempt.

358
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,950
Trillo's emotional palette was
substantially different back then.

359
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,190
I'm surprised you missed it.

360
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,160
Shocking.

361
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:18,830
Anger.

362
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,040
Disgust.

363
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,430
Though,that expression was
practically default back then:

364
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,180
the brow lowered, upper eyelid raised,

365
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,080
and that glare is the mark
of a hostile personality.

366
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,760
How many of these did Trillo
flash in the old video?

367
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,890
I don't know.

368
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,310
Three or four a minute?

369
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,080
Well,he didn't show
any in our interview.

370
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,720
Not until the burger incident.

371
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,420
Seems like a pretty big change to me.

372
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,080
Whatever.

373
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:44,510
Well...

374
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,170
Well,that is the kind
of emotionally detached

375
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,170
scientific analysis
we value around here.

376
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,790
I'll be sure to pass
that on to the governor.

377
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,780
Do you have any idea how much
worse the Punio-Salva war will be

378
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,280
if Trillo gets out and takes over?

379
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,600
Much,much worse.

380
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,550
I'm sure there'd be a boom
in the crack trade,too.

381
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,130
What if Trillo's just conning us?

382
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,850
Well,emotional evidence
suggests he's not the same man.

383
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,940
Do you know how many kids in the barrio

384
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,420
want the kind of power Trillo
had before he went away?

385
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,950
The guy is pretty good
at working the system.

386
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,940
Sure he is.

387
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,520
Read your Darwin.

388
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,720
Survival of the fittest:
it's not about being fit;

389
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,630
it's about being adaptable to change.

390
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,320
Violent people are violent.

391
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,750
They don't change.

392
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,990
HEIDI: Did you see the message from
Lieutenant Governor Goldin's office?

393
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,810
Nope.

394
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,650
Holly Sando,the widow of
the officer Trillo killed,

395
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,640
has decided to speak
to the parole board.

396
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,880
So she's testifying
against Trillo's release?

397
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,900
No. She's speaking on his behalf.

398
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,440
Tell Goldin we'll be there.

399
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,680
Rough interview?

400
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,220
I just...

401
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,310
You know,they're just all so tough.

402
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,920
You know,acting like nothing's wrong.

403
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,240
I mean,the last thing they're
going to do is talk to a woman.

404
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,150
I'm sorry. I...

405
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,670
I shouldn't be telling you this.

406
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,830
No. It's...

407
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,130
I understand.

408
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,490
No,it's,it's completely inappropriate.

409
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,010
No...

410
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,620
I know how they can be.

411
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,880
I don't think anybody
meant to hurt Eric.

412
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,650
The hazing got pretty bad,huh?

413
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,520
God,they'd... they're going to kill me

414
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,410
if they know that I'm
talking to you right now.

415
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,320
Someone has to.

416
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,760
There's something you should see.

417
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,600
No! No,but what happens
on an emergency call

418
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,500
when you don't wear your helmet?

419
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,650
What happens on an emergency call
when you don't wear your helmet?!

420
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,320
It's milder than I thought it would be.

421
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,350
LOKER: One of those guys
killed Eric Mitchell.

422
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,370
Okay,but this just
looks like a bad joke.

423
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,070
Whoa,wait. Look... look at Wallace.

424
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,450
FOSTER: What? He's smiling.

425
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,390
Yeah,sure,he's enjoying the joke,

426
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,240
but,uh...

427
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,560
every time he looks
directly at Mitchell...

428
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,460
Intense disgust.

429
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,610
That's more than a bad joke.

430
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,010
When Manny Trillo killed my husband,I...

431
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,400
I was angry.

432
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,440
For years,I couldn't even say his name.

433
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,490
Then one day, someone
told me about his book.

434
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,090
I had a morbid curiosity.

435
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,950
So I went out and bought a copy.

436
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,260
I read the whole thing...

437
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,890
in two days.

438
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,900
I was shocked.

439
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,480
<i>How could that man
have written such a...?</i>

440
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,840
I was just...

441
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,590
Everything I had believed...

442
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,730
It changed the way I look at things.

443
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,020
Ms. Sando?

444
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,080
Do you believe Mr. Trillo has changed?

445
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,130
Yes.

446
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,990
Yes,I do.

447
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,580
I believe he's repented.

448
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,510
He's changed his heart.

449
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,150
And he's changed mine.

450
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,100
That's quite a statement.

451
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,410
Yeah.

452
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,540
Of course she doesn't
believe a word she just said.

453
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,040
do you believe Mr. Trillo has changed?

454
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,310
Yes.

455
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,140
Yes,I do.

456
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,980
LIGHTMAN: There it is.

457
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,310
Slightest head shake no.

458
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,850
Now,

459
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,070
we do this by accident when
we don't mean what we say.

460
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,530
Holly Sando did it every time she
said she thought Trillo had changed.

461
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,130
And then there's this.

462
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,440
You can't let him die in this prison.

463
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,690
There.

464
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,100
Classic glare, which is a bit surprising
from a true believer in Mr. Trillo.

465
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,840
Why then lobby for the release
of a man who killed your husband

466
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,380
if you don't believe he's changed?

467
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,980
She may be trying to convince herself.

468
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,810
Maybe she believes he's
changed intellectually,

469
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,740
but she can't quite
get there emotionally.

470
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,560
Or maybe Trillo got one of his
old buddies to threaten her.

471
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,300
People always think that anger
is the most dangerous emotion,

472
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,310
but disgust is the language of hatred.

473
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,520
Hitler talking about the Jews.

474
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,000
Bin Laden talking about Americans.

475
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,730
And you during the
hazing of Eric Mitchell.

476
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,890
What did you have against Eric Mitchell?

477
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,220
The kid made my life hell.

478
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,790
You've been with the
department for almost a decade.

479
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,590
How does a probie like
Mitchell make your life hell?

480
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,400
Nine years.

481
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,940
Nine years,and I never had a problem.

482
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,130
I mean,the occasional bad joke,

483
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,260
watermelon in the locker.

484
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,390
But I kept my mouth shut.

485
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,950
We're not black. We're not white.

486
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,100
We're firemen.

487
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,970
So we get hazed.

488
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,310
Mitchell gets hazed,
he runs to the Vulcans,

489
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,990
the Black Firefighter Society.

490
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,420
Requested a transfer.

491
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,660
Mitchell made this racial.

492
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,510
So,you had to choose sides?

493
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,670
I tried to protect him,

494
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,850
but he was young and proud.

495
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,060
He wouldn't learn.

496
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,880
And the more he pushed,
the worse it got.

497
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,310
So,you hopped on the fire wagon.

498
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,330
You found out he had a peanut allergy,

499
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,610
and you thought, well,that'll teach him?

500
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,430
Yeah. We did that months ago.

501
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,850
The kid got hives all over,

502
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,560
and it was funny as hell,
but it didn't kill him.

503
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,550
No.

504
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,970
Things got much worse.

505
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,860
My guess-- someone
screwed with his equipment.

506
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,360
Wasn't you?

507
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,540
I wouldn't touch another
firefighter's equipment.

508
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,100
Now,I may have hated the kid,
but I didn't want him dead.

509
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,000
Someone did.

510
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,160
Who had the racial
problem with Mitchell?

511
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,700
A lot of guys.

512
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,520
It could have been any one of them.

513
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,190
I can't believe Wallace
didn't come forward earlier.

514
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,870
Yeah,the black firefighter
won't rat on the racists.

515
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,440
It is a little surprising,isn't it?

516
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,420
Well,not really.

517
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,830
The firehouse is a more important
association for Wallace than race.

518
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,120
And in his mind, race wasn't an
issue until Mitchell came along.

519
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,580
You're saying this was Eric's fault?

520
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,280
No,No. This is the new face of racism.

521
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,510
Instead of overt prejudice,

522
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,360
you see unconscious discrimination.

523
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,570
Nobody's joining the
Klan, but a lot of people

524
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:27,450
still hire the white guy over
the black guy with the same resum?

525
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,500
And when unconscious racism
surfaces,it can be lethal.

526
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,570
And then what starts out as
reasonable hazing turns deadly.

527
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,760
So,how do we find the men responsible?

528
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,680
We'd like to run the company
through a little experiment.

529
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,360
As I said earlier,

530
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,550
I... I've read his books,
and I've seen him interviewed,

531
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:54,810
and I really believe that Manny
Trillo was a... is a changed man.

532
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,490
I asked Holly Sando to come
in, and she wasn't up for it,so,

533
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,560
I pulled her statement to the
press after the parole hearing.

534
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,320
I think it's-it's amazing the way
he's-he's turned himself around.

535
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,470
She keeps flashing contempt,anger.

536
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,790
She still hates the guy.

537
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,010
You may be right.

538
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,900
Trillo may be threatening her.

539
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,920
LIGHTMAN: No. I told you,

540
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,130
everything we've seen
from Trillo up till now--

541
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,330
the old videotape,
the interview--

542
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,030
everything sugges he's evolved.

543
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,160
He's not the same man at all.

544
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,500
Did any of the reporters ask her why
she decided to testify for Trillo?

545
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,350
Um,yeah,they did.

546
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,360
MAN (on tape): Miss Sando,tell me,

547
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,850
what made you come forward
after all these years?

548
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,050
SANDO: I had heard that

549
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:38,020
the governor was considering a
pardon,and I thought,well,it...

550
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,850
It-It's time.

551
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,730
Eyebrows up, pulled together.

552
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,820
Fear.

553
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,400
There's your answer.

554
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,240
Stopping by for lunch?

555
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,700
No. Just a question.

556
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,600
Did you get someone to
threaten Holly Sando?

557
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,920
I'm not threatening Holly Sando.

558
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,200
Really?

559
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,190
Because that would be your
typical gangbanger move,right?

560
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,080
Get in touch with your old familiars.

561
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,350
Send her a message.

562
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,580
Look,that's not me, not anymore.

563
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,210
You sure you haven't called
any of your old friends?

564
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,900
<i>I don't talk to those lacras.</i>

565
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,470
<i>Oh,now,that is not the truth.</i>

566
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,460
You see how you're hunched over?

567
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:45,770
Well,we do that when we're lying.

568
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,000
We try to take up as
little space as possible.

569
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,170
And you really ought to work
on that anger trigger,mate.

570
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,810
Raises the blood pressure,

571
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,950
and the heart rate.

572
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,360
It's not good for you.

573
00:27:59,050 --> 00:27:59,800
Okay.

574
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,640
The truth is,

575
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,510
I'm in contact with some of them.

576
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,240
I'm working with the gang task force

577
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,380
on a truce between Punio and La Salva.

578
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,050
They told me to keep it quiet.

579
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,100
It's dangerous.

580
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,740
But I haven't been sending
anyone out after Holly Sando.

581
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,410
I don't believe you.

582
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,340
He hasn't changed.

583
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,450
His truce? Just so that
the cops won't notice

584
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,280
that he's taking over El Punio again.

585
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,430
<i>Nada es real ni es mentira.</i>

586
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,680
Nothing is real or a lie.

587
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,000
It all depends on the color

588
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,590
of the glass you're looking through.

589
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,620
Look,there's so much good I can
do if you just get me out of here.

590
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,470
Get me out of here, and
I'll prove it to you.

591
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,660
<i>Over the next ten minutes,</i>

592
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,070
you'll be shown a series of images.

593
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,770
Each image will be followed
by a series of adjectives.

594
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,280
If the adjective describes
the image, click yes.

595
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,450
If not,click no.

596
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,590
Hey,Sylvia.

597
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,750
What are you guys up to?

598
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,520
We're testing for racial bias.

599
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,540
People with unconscious
bias find it easier

600
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,660
to associate positive
adjectives with Caucasian faces.

601
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,190
When we shift to

602
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,600
an African-American face--
the biased firefighters

603
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,040
still associate the
adjective with the image.

604
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,700
It just takes them longer.

605
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,310
Clock the racist.

606
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,930
Oh,they're all racist.

607
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,990
Yeah,80% of people who
take this test are biased.

608
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,030
We're just looking for the
the guy who takes the longest.

609
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,420
FOSTER: Oh,they're just about done.

610
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,560
All right,can we,uh,

611
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,320
pull up the average association
time for each of them?

612
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:38,810
LOKER: It's taking David Caddick

613
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,750
three times as long to say nice
things about African-Americans.

614
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,530
Looks like we have a winner.

615
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,130
I am not a racist.

616
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,750
FOSTER: No,you don't think you are.

617
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:48,900
But it would explain why you took

618
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,790
such an active role in the hazing.

619
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,840
I didn't do anything
different than the other guys.

620
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,720
You didn't mess with
Eric Mitchell's equipment?

621
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,400
I didn't have a problem with Mitchell.

622
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,650
We know that you hated him.

623
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,470
You don't even realize
how much you hated him.

624
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,150
How much you hate all of them.

625
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,810
I'm telling you that I didn't have

626
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,790
any kind of a racial
problem with Mitchell.

627
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,020
But you had another problem with him.

628
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,780
The guy couldn't keep it in his pants.

629
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,100
This was...

630
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,850
about a girl?

631
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,600
You see the disgust?

632
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,500
Yeah.

633
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,050
Well,that's hate.

634
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,470
I'm guessing it's racially motivated.

635
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,490
Was that your problem?

636
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,370
Was it that he was
black and she was white?

637
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,090
I didn't know Eric was
dating a white girl.

638
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,090
Is that why this happened?

639
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,460
Well,we're not sure.

640
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,030
Racial hatred is about disgust,

641
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,410
but when we pressed
Caddick about the girl...

642
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,470
The predominant emotion was anger,

643
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,310
which suggests that Eric may
have crossed some other line.

644
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:03,070
That maybe Caddick was angry
because he disrespected his code.

645
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,510
By dating a white girl?

646
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,670
That's not part of any
code that I remember.

647
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,640
Well,we don't think this
was just any white girl.

648
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,280
Might have been anothe
firefighter's girl.

649
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,150
He knew better.

650
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,240
He was smarter than that.

651
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,970
Did he ever bring anyone
home from the firehouse?

652
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,640
Oh,God...

653
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,280
She came by.

654
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,820
After Eric died.

655
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,140
She was upset.

656
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,950
She brought me a meal.

657
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,910
Do you remember her name?

658
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,000
Kerry.

659
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,510
The chief's niece.

660
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,120
Should I call DC Gang Task Force?

661
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,860
Ask if they've heard of a
threat against Holly Sando?

662
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,110
Nope.

663
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,270
Trillo didn't show
any deception leakage.

664
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,610
Not when he denied threatening Sando,

665
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,400
not when was talking about the truce.

666
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,300
He's a criminal.

667
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,670
He's a fantastic liar.

668
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,690
He's an appalling liar.

669
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,700
He's atrocious.

670
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,950
The one time he did lie, he was...

671
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,090
completely transparent;
you should've seen that.

672
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,850
So you think he's telling the truth?

673
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,430
I don't think he's
going back to the gang.

674
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,400
Then why is Holly Sando lying?

675
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,770
If Trillo isn't threatening
her, why is she lying for him?

676
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,640
Well,I don't know.

677
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,400
Could be any number of reasons.

678
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,710
Yeah,but there aren't any.

679
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,510
Man,you need to listen to me.

680
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,500
You saw his anger.

681
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,010
You know this guy is violent.

682
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:41,410
<i>You need... you need to listen to me.</i>

683
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,680
You need to stop making this personal.

684
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,140
I'm not making this personal.

685
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,070
Yeah,you are.

686
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,370
Your procerus doesn't move,

687
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,440
which means you had
your nose fixed,right?

688
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,100
You don't strike me as
particularly vain,so...

689
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,800
So what is it then?

690
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,500
Who was it?

691
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,100
Was it your dad?

692
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,300
Your dad smack you around?

693
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,560
I know violent people.

694
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,610
They don't change.

695
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,680
You said so yourself.

696
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,250
Once people learn
this kind of trigger...

697
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,830
Who are you calling?

698
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,420
I think you might be right in a way.

699
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,700
Put me through to Lieutenant
Governor Goldin,please.

700
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,300
I think you should go ahead
and announce Trillo's release.

701
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,670
Let him go.

702
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,380
Yeah,just one thing,though.

703
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,580
I have...

704
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,160
I met Eric on his first day.

705
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,710
He was so excited.

706
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,000
He moved here from DC,
and he didn't know anyone,

707
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,300
so I... I offered to take him out.

708
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,250
I was being friendly,and...

709
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,340
and six months later,
he asked me to marry him.

710
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,400
Your relationship--
it was a secret?

711
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,730
It had to be.

712
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,810
Working in the house,it's like having
a dozen overprotective brothers.

713
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,710
And my uncle,he...

714
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,230
He didn't know?

715
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,210
He wouldn't let me date a fireman,

716
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,450
not... not one in his house.

717
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,970
That's why Eric put in for a transfer.

718
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,780
I thought that if we
made a clean break...

719
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,090
We were going to move to a
little town outside of Philly.

720
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,250
He wanted a family.

721
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,510
Jack?

722
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:54,910
I had no idea.

723
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,870
I had no idea that they
were in a relationship.

724
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,380
That's true.

725
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,980
LOKER: Apologies.

726
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:07,530
I took the liberty of taping
your reaction just now.

727
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,250
When your niece started
describing her relationship...

728
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,350
And six months later,
he asked me to marry him.

729
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,270
Surprise.

730
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,680
So,this has nothing to
do with Mitchell's murder?

731
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,620
FOSTER: It did.

732
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,000
Eric Mitchell was killed
because he stepped out of line.

733
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,420
He slept with the chief's niece.

734
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,110
He disrespected the code.

735
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,230
Now,the chief sets the rules,

736
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,610
but he doesn't enforce them.

737
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,250
That's somebody else's job.

738
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,360
I taped you,too.

739
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,400
And six months later,

740
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,720
he asked me to marry him.

741
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,450
Anger and disgust:

742
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,570
the language of hate.

743
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,590
You?

744
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,810
You killed him?

745
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,370
No.

746
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,540
I didn't.

747
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,510
I just wanted to humiliate him.

748
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,940
He needed to learn humility.

749
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,920
He was one of our men.

750
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,340
<i>No,he wasn't one of my men.</i>

751
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,570
My men respect the code.

752
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,230
My men don't complain when they're
forced to broom the latrine,

753
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,780
and my men know damn well
not to crap where they eat.

754
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,750
For God's sakes,Tommy.

755
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,180
You killed a man.

756
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,680
Arrest him.

757
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,940
I was just following the code.

758
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,030
Holly Sando?

759
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,750
Hi.

760
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,350
What have you got there,a .38?

761
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,710
.38 special?

762
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,250
Police said you registered
that a couple of months ago.

763
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,910
Long enough to figure
out how to use it,eh?

764
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,780
He's right.

765
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,230
I've been practicing.

766
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,460
Drop the weapon!

767
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,470
Drop the weapon!

768
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,440
Easy now,easy.

769
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,420
Okay,everybody, calm down.

770
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,700
Move out of the way!

771
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,330
Just give me a minute to talk to her.

772
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,460
TRILLO: Just want to talk to Ms. Sando.

773
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,950
Holly.

774
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,250
Holly.

775
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,820
Listen to me.

776
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,320
Can you listen to me?

777
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,350
If you have to do this,

778
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,350
I understand.

779
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,960
I want you to know that I understand.

780
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,500
I don't care if you've changed.

781
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,140
I don't care.

782
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:48,700
Manny,you're still the
man who killed my husband.

783
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,240
I know.

784
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,440
You took him away from me.

785
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,980
I know.

786
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,900
You took him away.

787
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,690
I know. And you,

788
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,920
you can change all you want.

789
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,240
You can never change that!

790
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,550
I know.

791
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,500
And I'm sorry.

792
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,740
I'm sorry.

793
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,670
I'm sorry.

794
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,870
* If I have

795
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,580
* Been ungrateful

796
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,050
* I've been unwise

797
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,940
* Restless

798
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:45,510
* From the cradle

799
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,480
* Now I realize

800
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:56,530
* It's so hard to see the rainbow *

801
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,520
* Through glasses

802
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,600
* Dark as these

803
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,780
* Maybe

804
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,670
* I'll be able

805
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,560
* From now on

806
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,190
* On my knees

807
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,430
* I am weak

808
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:32,890
* Oh,I know I am vain

809
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,940
* Take this weight from me

810
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,530
* Let my spirit be

811
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,170
* Unchained. Got a minute?

812
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,450
Trillo wanted you to have this.

813
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,410
I'm sorry about before.

814
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,030
Sometimes I see so much,

815
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,000
I don't know how not to tell people.

816
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,130
Yeah,I get that.

817
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,440
You're right.

818
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,160
Most people don't change.

819
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,260
I mean, I've been there,

820
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,400
hoping for it,

821
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,130
and then they just don't.

822
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,900
But there are a few, I think,

823
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,310
who can.

824
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,280
Any other life lessons?

825
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,140
When someone...

826
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,320
bashes you around,

827
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,140
who's twice your size,

828
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,820
just whenever he feels like it,

829
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,390
you learn to read emotions pretty fast.

830
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,920
We adapt to survive.

831
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,850
Your abuse made you a natural.

832
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,420
He made you what you are.

833
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,410
Well,I'll be sure to thank him.

834
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,440
So what about you?

835
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,230
I'm not a natural.

836
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,290
I had to learn this.

837
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,640
Why'd you want to learn?

838
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:38,110
What,you all of a sudden became
obsessed with facial expressions?

839
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,340
I didn't think so.

840
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:50,960
So who was it?

841
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,880
Who made you who you are?

842
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,710
