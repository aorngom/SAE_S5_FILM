1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,740
I can't believe you're really here.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,960
You should've called me first.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,370
And ruin the surprise? No way.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,140
You tell Mom and Dad
you were coming out?

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,060
Are you kidding?

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,250
I finished my last final and
took the first flight I could get.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,670
They're gonna freak out.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,940
Eh,they'll get over it.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,310
So,I figured since you couldn't
be home for the holidays,

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,740
I'd bring a piece of home to you.

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,180
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,920
Say hello to my little friend.

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,200
Marcus, you can't bring that here.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,480
What's the big deal?
Get rid of it right now.

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,480
Oh,relax. We'll smoke
it back at your place.

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,810
Put it away.

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,840
Put it back in your pack right now. Why?

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,380
Just do it,Marcus.

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,910
Don't look at them.

20
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,090
Stay calm.

21
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,480
Really calm.

22
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,860
What's going on? Who are these people?

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,850
They're Yemeni military.

24
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,300
Don't say anything. Keep your
hands where they can see them.

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,720
They have guns. What do we do?

26
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,840
Don't say anything.

27
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,970
Nicole,what do we do? Shut up,Marcus!

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,330
Nicole,what do we do?

29
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,560
Don't say a word.

30
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,240
What do we do? Shut up,Marcus.

31
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,950
Nicole,what do we do?

32
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,480
I...

33
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,730
I disrespected the most...

34
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,380
holy laws.

35
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,710
I do not deny this.

36
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,480
I'm so sorry for my actions.

37
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,020
I'm deeply... deeply sorry.

38
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,450
I am guilty of my crimes.

39
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,030
I do not deny this.

40
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:54,070
I also apologize and beg forgiveness.

41
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,560
They sound terrible.

42
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,980
Do you hear how terrible they sound?

43
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,370
Diane,you got to...
let 'em do their job.

44
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,300
Listen,I told you that we're negotiatingwith
the Yemeni government to release your children.

45
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,010
We're just having trouble getting
a read on their negotiator,

46
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,760
and that is why we
hired the Lightman Group.

47
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,880
We understand how hard this must be.

48
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,730
LOKER: We can tell you that last
year the Lightman Group helped free

49
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,760
several American hostages in Colombia.

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,770
You have to be patient.

51
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,430
It's been 29 days,

52
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,180
and my children are halfway around the
world having God knows what done to them.

53
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,810
Don't tell me to be patient.

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,960
You might have tried a little
diplomacy with Mom and Dad there.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,880
Please,I don't have time to hold hands.

56
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,350
The situation's getting
worse by the minute.

57
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,860
Why are the Yemenis detaining them?

58
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,220
The brother Marcus was visiting
the sister on spring break.

59
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,940
Yemeni police pulled
them over for speeding.

60
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,120
They find an ounce of
marijuana in the car.

61
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,130
Under Islamic law, trafficking
drugs is punishable by death.

62
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,360
Nicole slurred a few words.
Have they been tortured?

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,030
Well,she might have
seemed sleep-deprived,

64
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,560
but Yemeni's definitely not known for
its humane treatment of foreign prisoners.

65
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,080
LOKER: Is that their negotiator?

66
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,292
Yep. Guy speaks in monotone,

67
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,708
has an endless list of demands,
and we have no idea of what

68
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,720
he actually needs to get a deal done.

69
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,740
So if you can pick up...

70
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,150
anything in his speech or his
body language, get a read on him.

71
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,850
We'll take a look at the
negotiation footage...

72
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,760
I don't need details.

73
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,180
Okay?

74
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,180
I need answers.

75
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,680
Nicole and Marcus are
being sentenced in two days.

76
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,800
If we don't start making progress,

77
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
they're gonna be facing execution.

81
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,300
Dr. Buchanan?

82
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,800
Yes.

83
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,050
Hi. Ria Torres. Hi.

84
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,180
Dr. Lightman's just
finishing up a call. Oh,great.

85
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,460
You must be the new wunderkind
he's told me so much about.

86
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,600
<i>How many times has he lied to you?</i>

87
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,420
Excuse me? Well,he
said you're a natural.

88
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,250
You must have caught
him in some big fat ones?

89
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,010
Yeah,maybe one or two. One or two?

90
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,090
Oh,he's mellowed out.

91
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,890
Back in the day, he was pathological.

92
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,240
Really?

93
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,110
Oh,seriously.

94
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,120
The morning of my 25th birthday,

95
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,490
I look out my dorm window,
and there parked outside

96
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,200
is a vintage Harley
registered in my name.

97
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,700
I have no idea how he pulled that off.

98
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,210
Oh,come on. I'm serious.

99
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,930
That boy lied,cheated,and
stole his way through Oxford.

100
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,340
I never stole.

101
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,170
Uh-huh,so you say.

102
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,640
Hey-hey!

103
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,020
It's good to see you. And you.

104
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,630
You good? Yeah,I'm good.

105
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,470
I trust Jeffrey introduced himself.

106
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,780
Yep. Former US Surgeon General.

107
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,020
Used to be quite an important man.

108
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,710
Don't let him fool you.

109
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,320
I'm still quite an important man.

110
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,800
Yeah.

111
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Something wrong,Jeffrey?

112
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,260
Need your help,Cal.

113
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,530
<i>He's 27!</i>

114
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,100
Who has a stroke at 27?

115
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,960
Mrs. Coleman,Ribocore will do
everything we can to help you.

116
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,640
Everything? What are you doing

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,280
to track down the people
who did this to my husband?

118
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,770
BUCHANAN: That's Erica Vandeman.

119
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,350
She's the CEO of
Ribocore Pharmaceutical.

120
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,830
Is that one of the companies
that throws money at you?

121
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,860
I only take their money
if I believe in them.

122
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,290
BUCHANAN: Erica was a
student of mine at Georgetown.

123
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,310
She's one of the good guys.

124
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,680
Six weeks ago,someone broke
into the Ribocore labs,

125
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,240
stole the formula for Priox.

126
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,470
It's their new insulin pill.

127
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,150
Recently, a cheaper knockoff
version hit the market.

128
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,490
And it's killing people,Cal.

129
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
Drew Coleman is the
third case we've found.

130
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,780
They all took the knockoff.

131
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,690
Priox is a complicated compound.

132
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,000
Run the formula the wrong way,

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,620
and the side effects can be lethal.

134
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,640
Well,why don't you just call in the FDA?

135
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,730
FDA investigation would take months.

136
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,280
Our IT guys say the data
theft was an inside job.

137
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,830
Only three chemists have lab access.

138
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,920
They're all denying they were involved.

139
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,470
If you could tell us who's lying,

140
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,590
we can find out who's making
the knockoff and shut them down.

141
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,350
If we don't get this counterfeit
drug off the market soon,

142
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,530
we are looking at hundreds of deaths.

143
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,960
Okay,the Ribocore theft
took place at 2:27 a.m.

144
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,940
in testing lab 290.

145
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,940
Now,one of you...

146
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,280
disabled the scanner so it
couldn't identify your key card.

147
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,640
You know, I'm a chemist,not an engineer.

148
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,760
I wasn't even in the
building that night.

149
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,580
Now,you managed to avoid
the security cameras...

150
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,490
You know,this is ridiculous.

151
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,620
I've worked for Ribocorp for 15 years.

152
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,830
But one of you,

153
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,720
when you downloaded the Priox formula...

154
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,670
left your fingerprint on the data port.

155
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,670
<i>Well,you can check mine.</i>

156
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,800
Uh,come on. I use that
computer all the time.

157
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,460
So do I. I mean,you
can't possibly think...

158
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,420
No,I can't.

159
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,420
So you two can go.

160
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,650
So...

161
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,590
why'd you steal the Priox formula?

162
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,510
I didn't.

163
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,670
Go ahead. Check my fingerprints.

164
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,770
You didn't leave any.

165
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,990
I made that up.

166
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,250
What are you talking about?

167
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,680
The thief wore gloves.

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,370
But you knew that,didn't you?

169
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,220
That's why you leapt at the
chance to prove your innocence.

170
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,070
Only a guilty person...

171
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,200
would know that a fingerprint
couldn't possibly be theirs.

172
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,300
All right, call Vandeman and tell her
we found who stole the information.

173
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,740
It's not what you think.

174
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,630
<i>No,see,it's not what you think.</i>

175
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,140
That formula you sold,
your knockoff Priox,

176
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,560
it's killing people. You're wrong.

177
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,450
I didn't break in to the
lab to steal the formula.

178
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,050
Why,then?

179
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,310
Two months ago, I
came across a lab study

180
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,520
that said stroke was a
possible Priox side effect.

181
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,690
Vandeman had buried the full report,

182
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,140
but it was in the database
in testing lab 290.

183
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,640
I was trying to build
a case against the drug.

184
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,780
The problem isn't knockoff Priox.
It's the real drug, that's the killer

185
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,160
This is new.

186
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,690
I asked Grace not to
let anybody back here.

187
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,090
I'm going on Larry King to
talk up the new flu vaccine,

188
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,140
so this is just, you know,saving time.

189
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,880
Does your missus know how much you
spend on makeup? (chuckles): No.

190
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,580
And unless you want Larry
King to know how you got drunk

191
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,780
and talked your way past
White House security...

192
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,790
Never happened. Oh,that never happened?

193
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,440
Well,this never happened either.

194
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,740
I need to talk to you
about Erica Vandeman.

195
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,570
Derek,just,uh, give us a second. Thanks.

196
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,710
You find out who broke into
the lab and stole the formula?

197
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,600
The chemist who broke into the
lab wasn't after the formula.

198
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,510
Really?

199
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,980
"...early-stage testing on Priox..."

200
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,460
"...blood clotting
leading... to stroke."

201
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,740
What,this chemist is pretending to
be some kind of a whistle-blower?

202
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,890
Her study says that the
real drug is the killer.

203
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,120
Cal,it doesn't make sense.

204
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,290
Why would Erica hire you?

205
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,960
Damage control?

206
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,410
You hire us,and you...

207
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,730
spin this into a story
about a counterfeit drug.

208
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,710
No,not Erica.

209
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,710
I mean, if she thought this
drug was killing people,

210
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,030
she'd be first to
pull it off the market.

211
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,940
Well,the chemist doesn't
appear to be lying.

212
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,790
And the study indicates...
Indicates what?

213
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,600
What does it indicate?

214
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,490
It indicates nothing.

215
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,850
Maybe the lab was careless.

216
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,030
Maybe they made a mistake.

217
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,680
So you think I should talk to them?

218
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,210
Cal...

219
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,110
I have known Erica Vandeman for years,

220
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,480
and you spent,what,five
minutes with this chemist?

221
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,760
I'm as worried about
this drug as you are.

222
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,770
So give me the name, and
I will look into this.

223
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,870
Okay.

224
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,010
Hey,Heather.

225
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,980
Gillian,what are you doing here?

226
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,750
We're working with Peters
on the Yemeni negotiations.

227
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,330
Is my husband...?

228
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,930
He's at lunch.

229
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,850
Well,tell him I stopped by.

230
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,330
You're here early.

231
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,190
I like to be prepared.

232
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,220
Well,you're not billing me for it.

233
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,700
Where's the chia pet?

234
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,140
Loker?

235
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,150
Yeah,that guy definitely
needs a shave and haircut.

236
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,660
He's monitoring the
closed-circuit cameras

237
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,720
so he can do stress
analysis on the Yemenis.

238
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,770
But I'm sure he'll appreciate the tip.

239
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,580
Very funny.

240
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,310
Dr. Gillian Foster,

241
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,020
meet Deputy Ambassador Hassan.

242
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,670
It's a pleasure meeting you.

243
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,940
I trust you've been
briefed on our position?

244
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,570
She wouldn't mind hearing
it again. Very well.

245
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,540
We have several demands.

246
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,760
Yes,I'm sure, but actually,I'd
prefer to hear it from...

247
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,260
Deputy Ambassador Rafik.

248
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,590
I'm happy to oblige.

249
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,780
As Deputy Ambassador Hassan was saying,

250
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,390
we have several demands.

251
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,790
Well,you don't know what
the hell you're doing.

252
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,930
We have two days,and you wasted
the entire session talking to Rafik?

253
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,890
The guy's a mid-level
bureaucratic schlub.

254
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,970
Actually,he's not.

255
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,170
Loker,can you pull up
the Camp David video?

256
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,050
This is Yasser Arafat and
Ehud Barak at Camp David.

257
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,760
See how they're trying to shove
each other through the door?

258
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,930
In the Middle East,
appearances are very important.

259
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,180
The most powerful person is
always the last through the door.

260
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,340
When the Yemeni delegation
entered the room,

261
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,480
your man Hassan wasn't the last
one through the door; Rafik was.

262
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,570
That's why you couldn't get a read.

263
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,740
Hassan's a puppet.

264
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,290
He has no idea which
demands are important.

265
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,310
They wanted us to go down to the
wire so they could get the best deal.

266
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,700
They were trying to keep us in the dark.

267
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,420
Okay,so did you get
anything off of Rafik?

268
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,820
Well,we got clear vocal spikes on
the demands he cares about the most.

269
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,130
Of course, he wasn't the only one.

270
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,350
Yes,obviously,it goes
without saying that any deal

271
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,130
must secure the release of both
Nicole Bradin and her brother Marcus.

272
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,590
We hired you to focus on the
other side of the table,not ours.

273
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,720
Well,we catch the lies
wherever they come from.

274
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:10,420
And the vocal stress in your voice is
three times higher when you mention Nicole.

275
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,570
You care more about getting
her released than Marcus.

276
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,660
Why?

277
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,690
We can't do our jobs unless
we know your priorities.

278
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,980
I'm only going to say this once.

279
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,530
I want Marcus released
just as much as Nicole.

280
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,000
You got it?

281
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,600
"I'm only going to say this once":

282
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,610
classic qualifying statement.

283
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,220
He wouldn't need it if
he was telling the truth.

284
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,780
Will you get a hold of Nicole
and Marcus' confession videos?

285
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,540
Let's see what we can pick up.

286
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,110
Hey,I just set up a meeting with
Neeman Labs for tomorrow morning.

287
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,590
Yeah,postpone it.

288
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,110
I thought you wanted to talk
to them about the mouse study.

289
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,620
Jeffrey's looking into it.

290
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,160
Dr. Buchanan? Yeah. I
told him about Aisha,

291
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,130
told him about the study.

292
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,570
He said he'd look into it.

293
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,970
What,so we're just dropping it?

294
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,830
For now.

295
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,260
You think this one is ever
going to stop talking back?

296
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,100
I hope not.

297
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,560
Half day?

298
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,940
Hope you don't mind.

299
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,790
Got an hour free for dinner
Thought I'd steal her away.

300
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,160
No problem.

301
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:22,830
What?

302
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:25,800
What now?

303
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,610
You saw her covering,right?

304
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,030
I mean,you saw how upset she looked.

305
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,130
Congratulations.

306
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:34,940
Once again you've arrived at the apparently
foreign destination of None of Your Damn Business.

307
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,380
Man,I don't get you.

308
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,519
Good. Stop trying. Fine. Pretend
like you don't give a damn

309
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,570
what's going on with her. I know you do.

310
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,350
Sit down.

311
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,500
Sit down.

312
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,200
Look,in case you haven't
figured it out yet,

313
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,090
it's different when you're one of us.

314
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,140
Everybody has things
they don't wish to share.

315
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,160
She's your friend.

316
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,460
You're not listening to me.

317
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,700
In this workplace, with
everything that we see,

318
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,870
we have to be very clear on the rules.

319
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,400
You and Foster have rules?

320
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,330
If there's something she
wants to tell me,she will.

321
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,190
Everything else-- everything
else I see,I ignore.

322
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,050
I trust her to take care of herself.

323
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,870
Wow,when did you get religion?

324
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,020
You trust Foster. You trust Buchanan.

325
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,820
You were there.

326
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,600
Aisha Ward was telling the truth.

327
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,110
Jeffrey will get to the bottom of this.

328
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,950
He brought us the case.

329
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,810
Don't you think he's
just a little biased?

330
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,730
Okay.

331
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:39,860
How many people in
this world do you trust?

332
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,990
How many?

333
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,290
I don't know. Ten.

334
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,540
Six.

335
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,960
Well,when you get to my age,

336
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,040
there'll be three.

337
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,870
And when one of those
people asks you for 24 hours,

338
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,410
you give it to him.

339
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,040
Dr. Lightman.

340
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,910
Dr. Buchanan left you a message.

341
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,130
Well,can you get him on the line?

342
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,440
Yeah,but you might want to
take a look at this first.

343
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,060
Guess he did get to the bottom of it.

344
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,950
Really nice to meet you.

345
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,470
Thank you so much for you hospitality.

346
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,120
Tell Larry I'll come
back any time he'd like.

347
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,040
Thank you.

348
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,890
Cal what are you doing here?
You gave us Aisha Ward.

349
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,900
And a good evening to you,sir.

350
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,200
You went straight to Vandeman.

351
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,710
You didn't even bother to call.

352
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,730
Well,Cal, I didn't realize
we were going steady,

353
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,690
but I did try you at your office.

354
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,150
Hey,there are serious questions here.

355
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,180
I stopped investigating.

356
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,930
Cal,you were not hired
to investigate Ribocore.

357
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,980
You were hired to investigate
who broke into their lab.

358
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,140
The drug's killing people.

359
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,580
I have six lab reports on
Priox,including a 9,000-person study.

360
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,740
Priox did not cause
strokes in any of them.

361
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,690
Only the knockoff does that.

362
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,920
Ribocore's issued a warning and they're
working with police to find the distributor.

363
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,800
You read through this study?

364
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,460
Vandeman walked me through them,yes.

365
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,320
Oh,really?

366
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,440
She also showed me this.

367
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,030
The police did a little more digging.

368
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:26,510
Aisha Ward had $500,000 wired into her
savings account from an offshore bank

369
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,810
just before the break-in.

370
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,370
That would be four
times her annual salary.

371
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,290
She stole the formula,Cal.

372
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:35,980
She stole it.

373
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,110
She sold it.

374
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,180
Now she's trying to cover it up.

375
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,830
I'm not easily fooled,Jeffrey.

376
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,410
I know.that makes you one hell of lier

377
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:05,400
What do you want?

378
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,400
Well,I love being duped.

379
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,640
Doesn't happen often,but,
you know,I'm intrigued.

380
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,810
So,we can either chitchat or...

381
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,330
you can tell us the truth.

382
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,980
I gave you the truth,and you
ran right back to Vandeman.

383
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,090
You're incredible... you're incredible.

384
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,510
You're incredible.

385
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,290
You know,it's not hard
to find a good liar,but...

386
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,250
a truly great one... that's rare.

387
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,000
I am not lying.

388
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,070
Well,your bank statement says you are.

389
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,890
500 grand wired to your account.

390
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,000
Now,that sounds about
right for the formula

391
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,700
to a billion-dollar drug,
so who did you sell it to?

392
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,480
Doesn't matter.

393
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,450
Oh,so you admit it.

394
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,010
You sold the formula?

395
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:48,010
Sure,I sold it, but I didn't need
to break into the lab for that.

396
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,360
I knew the formula by heart.

397
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,260
I sold it months before the break-in.

398
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,610
So,why break into the lab at all?

399
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,670
I told you.

400
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,580
I found the summary for the mouse study.

401
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,340
I wanted the full report.

402
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,850
Mouse study was an outlier.

403
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,560
Just one bad test.

404
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,090
Did you talk to Neeman Labs?

405
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,100
That study is evidence
that Priox is a killer.

406
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,440
Yes,I sold the formula,

407
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,880
but then,I found the study and...

408
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,430
it tore at my conscience.

409
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,650
I had to do something.

410
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,950
So,first, corporate thief...

411
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,280
then,whistle-blower.

412
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,800
That's what you want
us to believe,right?

413
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,570
Please.

414
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,410
Someone has to get Priox off the market,

415
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,060
and the knockoff I sold is
the same as the real thing,

416
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,530
and the real thing is killing people.

417
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,010
Go to Neeman Labs.

418
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,040
They'll tell you.

419
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,290
Thanks for seeing us at such
short notice, Dr. Dembeck.

420
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,290
Uh,no problem.

421
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,660
It's,uh... it's a light day.

422
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,250
Oh... very light.

423
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,100
LIGHTMAN: Want to ask you
a couple of questions about,

424
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,150
um,some testingyou did
on a drug called Priox.

425
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,060
Uh,I have nothing to say.

426
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,010
Why is that?

427
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,000
'Cause you botched the test?

428
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,140
Anger's real.

429
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,800
No shame,no guilt.

430
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,270
Maybe Ribocore didn't like what
they got back in the report.

431
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,150
So,what,did they,uh,

432
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,100
just drop you as a client,then?

433
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,260
They fired us... okay?

434
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,150
They blackballed us and gave the drug to a lab
that would give them the results that they wanted,

435
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,040
that would test it into compliance.

436
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,180
And then,after that,
there was no more testing?

437
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,320
Priox. Yeah.

438
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,160
No,but I have heard rumors
about some of the other studies.

439
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,550
You know,I got into this business to do
cutting-edge research to try to help people.

440
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,350
Apparently,science and
business just don't mix.

441
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,970
Have you seen Dr. Lightman?

442
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,710
He went down to the hospital.

443
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,290
DC General. What for?

444
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,820
Our Priox victim,
Drew Coleman--

445
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,870
he had another stroke.

446
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,990
He's being taken off life support.

447
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,170
Oh,my God.

448
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,910
That's not all.

449
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,980
I found anecdotal evidence online.

450
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,160
Two more stroke cases linked to Priox.

451
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,250
Both victims young, both
in good physical shape.

452
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,650
That's still not gonna be enough
to get it pulled off the market.

453
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:21,077
I'll be right back

454
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,240
Hey.

455
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,820
Torres told me you were here.

456
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,320
Is everything okay?

457
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,730
Well,for Mr. Coleman it's not.

458
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,780
Maybe Aisha Ward was right.

459
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,720
You don't have to do this.

460
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,130
If you want to choose
your friendship first,

461
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,420
you can just hand this
over to the authorities.

462
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,670
Let somebody else investigate it.

463
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,380
Yeah,I'm sure they'd do a bang-up job.

464
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,400
I'm just saying that...

465
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,480
You can walk away.

466
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,710
What if the drug really
is killing people?

467
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,830
Come on.

468
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,390
I need to show you
something back at work.

469
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,010
I'm so sorry for my actions.

470
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,200
I'm deeply,deeply sorry.

471
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,860
So,like I told you, we
think the State Department's

472
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,990
more interested in
getting his sister out.

473
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,440
There's nothing noteworthy here.

474
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,650
Yeah,but check out Nicole.

475
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:32,730
I also apologize and beg forgiveness.

476
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,570
At first we thought it was just sleep
deprivation, but she doesn't look fatigued.

477
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,170
No slouching,no leaning.

478
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,870
I mean,I guess that could be adrenaline.

479
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,950
No,she's not sleep-deprived.

480
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,950
She's slurring her words intentionally.

481
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,070
The US should leave Iraq now.

482
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,900
Saddam Hussein is a great leader.

483
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,790
I don't understand.

484
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,030
Who is this soldier?

485
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,580
He's an American POW
from the first Gulf War,

486
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,220
but what's relevant
here is that he's using

487
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,420
the same speech pattern in his
confession that your daughter does.

488
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,500
It's a code; the army teaches
soldiers to slur their words

489
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,470
if captured or forced
to give a confession.

490
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,160
The enemy can't hear the difference,

491
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,200
but it signals that
they haven't broken you.

492
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,210
It's part of the military
Survival,Evasion,Resistance, and Escape training.

493
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,140
Military training?

494
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,320
Neither of our children
have any military training.

495
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,550
The State Department
files don't mention any.

496
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,290
I'm sorry. What are you saying?

497
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,220
Diane,please... Don't do that,Robert!

498
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,980
You've been telling me to
be calm this whole time.

499
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,600
Now,Marcus is a poetry
major,for God's sake!

500
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,190
What about your daughter?

501
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,240
This is a joke.

502
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,250
Mr. Bradin?

503
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,010
To my knowledge,

504
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,120
Nicole's never been
involved with the military.

505
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,230
"To my knowledge."

506
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,310
Are you telling us everything?

507
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,880
Robert?

508
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,640
Mr. Bradin,I can't be effective
without all the information.

509
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,990
I can't give you all the information.

510
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,670
Robert,what are you talking about?

511
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,820
I can't tell you.

512
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,620
I'm not supposed to know.
I'd be breaking the law.

513
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,470
She's US intelligence.??????????

514
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,930
What the hell were you thinking?

515
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,080
Uh,excuse me?

516
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,920
Our firm has a
reputation for discretion.

517
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,400
You have secrets, you tell us.

518
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,430
Otherwise, we can't do our job.

519
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,480
I still don't know what
you're talking about.

520
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,180
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

521
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,160
Nicole Bradin is a spy.

522
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,660
How was I supposed to tell you that?

523
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,060
It's classified information.

524
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,510
Get a lot of people
killed, including Nicole.

525
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,680
I wish I had known that earlier.

526
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,720
Yeah,well, maybe now you'll
understand why I'm taking the deal.

527
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,300
Wait. What deal?

528
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,930
Rafik called an hour ago.

529
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:56,250
<i>He's offering to hand over one of the prisoners
in exchange for their  humanitarian demands.</i>

530
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,450
We're getting Nicole back.

531
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,320
We'll do what we can for Marcus.

532
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,180
No,that is a terrible call.

533
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,210
It'll tear the family apart.

534
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,090
Nicole will never be
able to live with herself.

535
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,850
Okay,do you understand
that woman knows the address

536
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,960
to every CIA safehouse
in the Middle East?

537
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,700
And you're worried about her feelings?

538
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,170
Rafik's demanding patriot
missiles for Marcus.

539
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,430
So,it's a nonstarter.

540
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,400
We're done here.

541
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,410
I am getting Nicole back home before the
Yemenis find out who she is,and that is it.

542
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:34,810
Dr. Foster.

543
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,820
Mr. Bradin, what are you doing here?

544
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,530
The,uh,State Department
hasn't been returning my calls.

545
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,830
I didn't know where else to go.

546
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,280
This is Ms. McDermott
from the Red Cross.

547
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,910
One of their nurses was allowed
to visit Marcus yesterday

548
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,110
and she managed to get these photos out.

549
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,380
What happened?

550
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,760
Apparently,he tried to escape.

551
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,810
The Yemeni guards beat him severely.

552
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,560
He has broken ribs and a concussion.

553
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,100
He hasn't been allowed to see a doctor.

554
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,960
Our nurse demanded that Marcus be transferred
to a medical facility for treatment.

555
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:28,070
She was told there was
no point in treating him.

556
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,180
Marcus is going to
be sentenced tomorrow.

557
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,310
And then they're going to execute him.

558
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,420
They're gonna shoot my son.

559
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,170
Please.

560
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,520
You gotta get him out.

561
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,970
You need to raise the acidity if
you want it to act as a compound.

562
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,750
Oh,scientist and a businesswoman.

563
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,930
No wonder Jeffrey was such an advocate.

564
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,840
Dr. Lightman,Ms. Torres.

565
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,150
This is a pleasant surprise.

566
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,980
I'm sorry about the unexpected pop-in,

567
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,290
but I find the more time
one has to prepare a lie,

568
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,980
the harder it is for me to spot.

569
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,550
Okay.

570
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,890
Would you excuse us for a moment?

571
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,760
So,what can I do for you?

572
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,500
Oh,well,um,some of the pharmaceutical journals
found out that I was involved in the case

573
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,460
and they,uh,called
with a couple questions.

574
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,610
So,I thought I'd just
run a few things by you.

575
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,620
Sure. Appreciate that.

576
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,490
Uh,well,first then...

577
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,170
The real Priox versus the knockoff drug.

578
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,690
What exactly is the difference?

579
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,390
Well,it's complicated.

580
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,870
It has to do with the way
that you run the compound.

581
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,890
All right,well...

582
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:49,720
Try me.

583
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,490
I was quite a chemist back in Oxford.

584
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,370
There's certain proprietary information.

585
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,690
Why don't you have the journals
refer to me on that one?

586
00:28:59,300 --> 00:28:59,940
Okay.

587
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,380
How about the mouse study
Ms. Ward keeps mentioning?

588
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,250
There's nothing to it.

589
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,900
No other Priox testing
showed any side effects.

590
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,020
And all these labs are
on the up-and-up,right?

591
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,080
I am intimately involved with
every one of those companies.

592
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:16,900
I trust them all.

593
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,560
Oh,well,that's good.

594
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:22,320
'Cause it's quite hard to find a
company one can trust these days,right?

595
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,610
So,she bit her lip
every time I went at her.

596
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,090
<i>Incredibly anxious.</i>

597
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,520
I don't know how we missed it earlier.

598
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,370
Well,lie detection's all about
asking the right questions.

599
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,900
Shame.

600
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,630
They were paying top dollar,too.

601
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,960
You calling reporters?

602
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,810
No,made them up.

603
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,450
Uh,Vandeman will be
trying to track them down,

604
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,660
which will buy us a little time.

605
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,460
Time for what?

606
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,360
Heidi? Yeah.

607
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,390
Can you make an appointment with,

608
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,210
uh,Jim Gunderson of the FDA?

609
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,380
Tell him it's urgent.

610
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,490
Yeah,I'm on my way back.

611
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,180
It's mice,Cal.

612
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,480
It's one study.

613
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,150
Yeah,well,Vandeman's lying
about the other tests.

614
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:03,920
Well,even if you're right,

615
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,760
there's not enough here to
pull Priox off the market.

616
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,530
I can start investigation,
but I can't do more than that.

617
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,140
FDA investigations take months.

618
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,250
A lot of people could die,Jim.

619
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,200
Well,if you can prove that Vandeman
manipulated the Priox testing,

620
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,640
I'll recall the drug immediately.

621
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,070
But without more hard
data, my hands are tied.

622
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,090
All right,well,uh,

623
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,560
do you mind if I use your name?

624
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,300
Throw it around,see if
I can open a few doors?

625
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,860
You should start with
your friend Buchanan.

626
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,320
He was a driving force
behind the drug's approval.

627
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,460
Buchanan pushed the drug?

628
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,500
Yeah,I can show you about a dozen
letters he submitted on behalf of Priox.

629
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,270
You do know he's on
the Ribocore payroll?

630
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,990
He's not involved in this.

631
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,660
Jeffrey encouraged me
to come and talk to you.

632
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,840
I mean,he's as eager to get to
the bottom of this as we are.

633
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,000
"Jeffrey encouraged me to come see you?"

634
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,340
All right,the walls
at the FDA have ears.

635
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,510
Yeah,well,then I'm sure they
can tell you were lying,too.

636
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,080
Hey,if Jeffrey knew what was going on,

637
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,520
he'd have come to the FDA himself.

638
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,700
The guy's on the payroll.

639
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,190
He pushed the drug
through FDA approvals.

640
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,650
You can't really believe that.

641
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,620
You know...

642
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,250
If it was someone in
your family,all right,

643
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,320
how much proof would you
need before you hung them out?

644
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,610
I... Look,if Jeffrey knows
about Priox, he's going to jail,

645
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,970
but I'm gonna be damn sure
before I send him there.

646
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,950
All right?

647
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,190
Okay. Good.

648
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,060
I thought you said Peters
was making the deal.

649
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,910
Just because he's done
doesn't mean we are.

650
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,330
He's almost comical with the sound off.

651
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,590
I'm trying to concentrate here.

652
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,310
Well,he's got the best
posture I've ever seen.

653
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,280
He looks like Mussolini.

654
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,840
He's trying to make himself look bigger.

655
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,920
Men,gorillas,blowfish.

656
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,020
You know,when they want to appear
dominant they puff themselves up.

657
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,400
This guy's definitely
compensating for something.

658
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,420
Maybe you're on to something.

659
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,880
Rafik really cares about appearances.

660
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,230
He wants to look like a leader.

661
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,250
That could be our leverage.

662
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,600
Hey,I thought I heard you come back in.

663
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,320
Where's Torres?

664
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,420
I sent her off to talk
to labs that tested Priox.

665
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,470
You know,Jeffrey always
loved the limelight.

666
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,700
Can't tell you how many
times I'd come home,

667
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,580
switch to the news, and there he is...

668
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,060
in my living room...

669
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,310
pushing some new drug or other.

670
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,180
Cal...

671
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,490
Merry-go-round of government,
business,and media.

672
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,900
Enough money and fame to
make heads spin,I suppose.

673
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,930
Do you really think Jeffrey's guilty?

674
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,870
I don't know.

675
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,950
I don't know.

676
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,500
You know,when my mother died,

677
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,430
Jeffrey took the train
back to London with me.

678
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,330
I'd only known him for about a month.

679
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,860
But he skipped out of college and...

680
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,870
came with me just to keep me company.

681
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,840
So,honestly,I don't know.

682
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,880
Hey,I've got something you should see.

683
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,790
So,I went to all six Priox testing labs.

684
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,340
I didn't get anything until I talked

685
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,460
to the researcher at the lab
that did the 9,000-person study.

686
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,540
He show signs of deception leakage?

687
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,270
Yeah,he looked like he was
about to hurl,so,I came back

688
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,730
and pulled a video of Vandeman
talking about that study.

689
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,030
Priox promises to help the
millions living with diabetes.

690
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,240
An intensive 9,000-person study...

691
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,580
Same lip bite.

692
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,660
She does it every time
she talks about that study.

693
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,090
...And given the depth and the
breadth of this 9,000-person study....

694
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,520
Just like today.

695
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,440
She is totally freaked out.

696
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,030
She's not the only one.

697
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,480
What? He's just staring at the floor.

698
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,230
Yeah,watch.

699
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,340
He looks at her when she's
talking about the study

700
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,240
and then catches her eye
and then looks down and away.

701
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,680
Signs of... Guilt.

702
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,560
Yeah.

703
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,920
I'm sorry.

704
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,980
yeah me too

705
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,520
Where did you dig this up?

706
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,350
I still remember you bounding into
morning lab straight from the poker tables,

707
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,300
having hustled some
jackass out of 100 pounds.

708
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,180
Seems like a thousand years ago.

709
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,200
Yeah. I could read you back then.

710
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,530
Not as well as you thought.

711
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:49,750
What?

712
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,100
I spoke to Gunderson at the FDA.

713
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,860
We know the 9,000-person
study is a sham,

714
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,150
so if you've gotanything to
say, you should say it now.

715
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,160
Cal,I have no idea what
you're talking about.

716
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,810
She's selling a killer drug.

717
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,110
We spoke to the testing labs.

718
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,560
We watched her on tape.

719
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,920
Aisha Ward was telling
the truth about Priox.

720
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,550
If Vandeman's lying...

721
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,260
Are you serious?

722
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,240
Yeah.

723
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,530
And I know you're helping.

724
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,240
Oh,and you think that I
would do something like that?

725
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,140
Tell me it's not true.

726
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,230
It's not true. You're lying.

727
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,870
I can see it in your face. No,I'm not.

728
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,550
Yeah,you are. You're covering.

729
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,830
You are unbelievable, you know that?

730
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,270
I saw the guilty look you
have when you watch Vandeman.

731
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,730
You're involved in this.

732
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,640
There's no "this," Cal.

733
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:30,780
Okay?

734
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,260
Erica and I are having an affair.

735
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,140
That's it.

736
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,810
We're having an
affair,okay? You happy now?

737
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,890
You're cheating on Sarah?

738
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,440
Are you going to lecture
me about marriage now?

739
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:42,840
'Cause,you know what?

740
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,900
That would be rich.

741
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:48,160
You really had no idea she
was manipulating the data.

742
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,680
You know something?

743
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,530
For somebody who studied
emotions their entire life,

744
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:57,020
you really don't understand them at all.

745
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,540
You have to stay away from her,Jeffrey.

746
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,520
Okay.

747
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,730
I mean it. This investigation's
going to get ugly.

748
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,520
Erica's going to jail.

749
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,830
You can't call her. You can't email her.

750
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,220
You can't be near her when that happens.

751
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,530
I mean it. Stay away from her.

752
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,270
Thanks for the friendly advice.

753
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,480
Mr. Peters,I just got your message.

754
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,450
I thought we had a deal.

755
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,070
We have another proposal.

756
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,390
There's only an hour until sentencing.

757
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,170
Please.

758
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:39,980
Hear us out.

759
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,350
I'm listening.

760
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:47,840
In return for the pardon and
release of Nicole and Marcus Bradin,

761
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,270
the United States is prepared to meet
all of Yemen's humanitarian demands.

762
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,120
This is an insult.

763
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,820
Ambassador Rafik.

764
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,870
To thank you for putting
aside your military demands,

765
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
we would like to show our gratitude.

766
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,180
What's this?

767
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,150
It's an invitation.

768
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,770
RAFIK: A state dinner.

769
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,550
Honoring the Republic of Yemen.

770
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:25,600
Only leaders held in the highest
esteem are hosted at the White House.

771
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,900
The President's social secretary
has a few dates in mind,

772
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,560
and the Chief of Staff
has assured me already

773
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,020
that you'll be seated
beside the President himself.

774
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,500
I almost forgot we had a date.

775
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,430
We need to talk.

776
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,080
Jeffrey.

777
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,990
I think we should go to your office.

778
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,260
Hey,how did you get
Buchanan to go for this?

779
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,920
you didn't tell him?

780
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,650
I did not doctor the report.

781
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,940
Then why is the 9,000-person
study so perfect?

782
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,590
Why are there no outliers?

783
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:30,200
You and I both know every
drug has side effects.According to this

784
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,610
Priox has almost none at all.

785
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,690
How is that possible?

786
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,130
You doctored the report.

787
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,390
We were behind.

788
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,520
The drug had been promised to market.

789
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,820
The stock price was falling.

790
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,940
The board was all over me.

791
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,970
What would you have done?

792
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:47,990
Postponing the Priox launch would
have put Ribocore into bankruptcy.

793
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,920
I think we got enough,
don't you? Shall we?

794
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,870
We have two choices:

795
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:56,600
Destroy the company or put out
the drug and hope for the best.

796
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,530
Hope for the best?

797
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,640
We have been working on a new pill.

798
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,240
We've got the blood
clotting under control.

799
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,550
We're about to reintroduce
Priox to market.

800
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,270
If you can just buy me a few months...

801
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,900
Buy you a few months? Did you just say,

802
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,780
"buy you a few months"?
What about Drew Coleman?

803
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,520
What about the other victims? Tell me.

804
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,750
I just need a few months.

805
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,730
Dr. Vandeman, you're under arrest.

806
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,030
Put your hands behind your back. Cal?

807
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,440
What the hell's going on?

808
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,510
Oh,you can drop it now,Jeffrey.

809
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,720
FBI have got what they want.

810
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,180
I'm pulling Priox off
the market immediately.

811
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,480
Thanks for your help, Jeffrey.

812
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,860
I prefer to get the truth in person,

813
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,010
but sometimes we just have to make do.

814
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,300
Yeah.

815
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,550
Okay.

816
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,850
You should have told me,Cal.

817
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,610
Should have warned me
the feds were listening.

818
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,320
Told you to stay away from her.

819
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,590
What if I'd offered to protect
her? What if I'd agreed?

820
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,520
I knew you wouldn't.

821
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,100
Oh,so now you have faith in me?

822
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:26,370
You know,I can count on one hand the
number of people I'd do anything for.

823
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,840
You were one of 'em.

824
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,950
I would've lied for you.

825
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:37,950
Jeffrey.

826
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,190
I wish I could believe that.

827
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,160
...and earlier this evening,

828
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,370
the State Department successfully
convinced the Yemeni government

829
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:03,120
to pardon and release
Nicole and Marcus Bradin.

830
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:09,430
This is a proud new step in
what we hope will continue

831
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:14,120
to be a productive friendship
with the United States.

832
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,770
Well,at least one of us had a good day.

833
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,740
You saved his reputation
and kept him out of jail.

834
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,370
Jeffrey will come around eventually.

835
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,350
You've known each other too long.

836
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,460
One second.

837
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,150
Hi,honey.

838
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,320
Uh,yeah,I just got back to the office.

839
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,230
Okay.

840
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,130
Yeah,no,no,uh,I...

841
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,310
I understand.

842
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,130
Do you want me to pick something up?

843
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:57,430
All right,well,just let me
know if you change your mind.

844
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,910
Okay.

845
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,010
Alec stuck at work?

846
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,500
We're almost on the right schedule.

847
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,050
You know,I spend my days
at the State Department.

848
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,570
He spends his nights there.

849
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:12,850
You want to grab some dinner?

850
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,290
I'd love to.

851
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,390
But I've got to take care of something.

852
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,430
Rain check?

853
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,610
Sure.
