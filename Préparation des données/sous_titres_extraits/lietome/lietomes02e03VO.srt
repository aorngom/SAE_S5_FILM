1
00:00:32,895 --> 00:00:34,145
Hi, it's Marla.

2
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:35,826
I changed my mind.

3
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,499
I can't do this right now.

4
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:40,068
You're here?

5
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:42,045
At the club?

6
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:48,251
I can't meet you.

7
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,174
I have to get back to my daughter.

8
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:54,862
Mom?

9
00:00:58,695 --> 00:00:59,695
Mom.

10
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:07,229
Mom.

11
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:11,957
Mom! Where are you?

12
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,250
You don't trust me.

13
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,420
It's such a control thing.
Admit it.

14
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:53,608
You're reluctant
to leave me in charge.

15
00:01:53,691 --> 00:01:56,391
- Rubbish.
- Then why haven't you gone yet?

16
00:01:57,352 --> 00:01:59,083
What?
Why are you trying to get rid of me?

17
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,410
You haven't had a vacation
in 6 years, Cal. Come on.

18
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:03,575
- You are trying to miss your flight.
- I'm not.

19
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:06,056
I am not.
I am trying to find

20
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:07,523
the Anderson file.

21
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:09,174
I've got it, all right?

22
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:10,738
I can take care of it.

23
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:12,217
Stop stalling.

24
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,417
Where are you going?
Honestly, Cal.

25
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,088
The cab is outside waiting for you.
Grab your jacket and let's go.

26
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,448
You deserve this.

27
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:20,499
- Emily's waiting for you.
- Don't push me.

28
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:21,683
Come on, let's go.

29
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:23,045
Here.

30
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:25,989
Give me your cell phone,
you don't need to check in.

31
00:02:26,072 --> 00:02:28,122
It's just gonna stress you out.

32
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,410
No kicking and screaming?

33
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:32,748
I have absolute faith in you.

34
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,503
And my staff.

35
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,083
Here I go, then.

36
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:42,065
Have a good time.

37
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:02,640
Are you really working?

38
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,549
We've only been here 2 days.

39
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:07,334
You really need to learn
how to relax, dad.

40
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:10,449
People who can't relax die younger.
I learned that in health class.

41
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:12,750
Don't worry about me, love.

42
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,086
- What are you looking at, anyway?
- Nothing.

43
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:17,069
You're spying on the office?

44
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:19,114
I'm my own boss.

45
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,999
That's a 24/7 job.

46
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:23,869
When I'm a stressed-out workaholic,
I'll have you to thank.

47
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:25,792
When did you become
such a know-it-all?

48
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,485
We had an agreement
that if I behave maturely,

49
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:31,729
you'd treat me like an adult.
As an adult, I'm telling you to relax

50
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,539
and stop it
with the creepy snooping.

51
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:36,173
If you don't,
I'll just go pick up boys by the pool.

52
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,560
All right, deal.

53
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,596
- I'll have one of those too, thanks.
- Make it a virgin.

54
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,617
Dr. Cal Lightman?

55
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:51,118
My name's Lou Nemeroff.
I'm with the american embassy.

56
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:54,401
There's an urgent matter
that we need your help with.

57
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,766
An american woman, Marla Seeger,

58
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:04,235
disappeared 2 days ago
from the Oceano Hotel.

59
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:06,064
It's just down the beach.

60
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:07,997
She was last seen at the hotel bar.

61
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,682
This is local news footage.

62
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,881
This is the bartender who last saw her.
He says that she was drunk,

63
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,288
coming on to several men, and that
she eventually left with one of them.

64
00:04:23,148 --> 00:04:25,320
The local police,
they aren't doing anything.

65
00:04:25,403 --> 00:04:27,600
They believe
that she left voluntarily.

66
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:30,519
<i>She's a really good mom.
I just want to find her.</i>

67
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:34,054
<i>Mom, if you're watching this,</i>

68
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,591
<i>please come back.</i>

69
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:38,652
And that's her 12-year-old daughter.

70
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:42,061
Oh, my god, that's so sad.

71
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:44,986
What's the D.O.S. doing about this?

72
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:48,203
Their official policy is to leave it
in the hands of local authorities.

73
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,421
So nothing.

74
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:50,915
They're doing nothing.

75
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:53,667
Which makes me wonder
why you're here.

76
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:57,838
Your boss doesn't know
about this little field trip of yours.

77
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,049
I can't ignore what's
going on in Mexico.

78
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,028
Which is?

79
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:03,817
More than 200 americans have gone
missing in the last few years,

80
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,178
mostly collateral damage
from the drug cartels,

81
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:10,257
but unless it's some pretty blond teen,
nobody even wants to talk about it.

82
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:12,161
All I need to know

83
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:14,688
is if somebody on this video
is trying to hide something.

84
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,548
The detective in charge of the case
and the bartender.

85
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,987
Dr. Lightman,
can you help us find Marla Seeger?

86
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,708
- Dad.
- What?

87
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:25,991
Come on.

88
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:32,652
Some people at the hotel,
they said that they saw your mom crying.

89
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:34,312
Why was she sad?

90
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,860
I don't know.

91
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:39,928
Everyone's saying she was a bad mother,
but she always took good care of me.

92
00:05:41,303 --> 00:05:42,299
I'll bet she did.

93
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,718
You think you can find her?

94
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,054
Absolutely.
He's definitely gonna find your mom.

95
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:52,442
I don't know.

96
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:53,978
I don't know, love.

97
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,910
You ever think that
grownups are full of crap?

98
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:02,296
Lots of times.

99
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:04,522
Usually,
it's 'cause we've made a mistake,

100
00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:06,738
done something wrong,

101
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:09,410
but we don't want to talk about it,
we don't want to admit it.

102
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:11,757
Which makes us hypocrites.

103
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:15,884
I think you've got a secret.

104
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,644
And you're too scared
to talk about it.

105
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:35,129
Mom always picks awful boyfriends,

106
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:37,646
so I signed her up
for an online dating service.

107
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:43,297
This is a guy you found for her?

108
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,696
He said he traveled a lot
and I told him we're coming here.

109
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:47,156
What did he say?

110
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:49,533
He said he'd meet me.

111
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,160
I wasn't aware of this.

112
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,974
J-Rod25.

113
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,165
My mom was supposed
to have dinner with him last night.

114
00:06:57,736 --> 00:06:59,761
What if he did something to my mom?

115
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,341
We rushed over here right away.
Did we hear right?

116
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,556
3 patients have been infected
by tainted blood?

117
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,984
The first patient died this morning
at Cottage Hospital,

118
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:12,582
and the second is in critical condition
at St. Mary's.

119
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,757
This is Gary Spar,

120
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,894
the third patient to receive
a blood transfusion during surgery.

121
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,595
It should have been a routine operation,
but he never woke up.

122
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:22,836
I need you to seal off that O. R.
And gather and test everything.

123
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,037
So 3 different patients
at 3 different hospitals?

124
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,450
It's no longer a coincidence.

125
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,831
We shut down
the D. C. Central blood bank.

126
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:32,114
Go help Pat rule out
any other possible contaminants.

127
00:07:32,197 --> 00:07:34,849
We're in a real quandary.
We need to protect people,

128
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:38,337
but if there's no blood available
for trauma cases and other emergencies,

129
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,707
patients may die anyway.

130
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,500
Do you have any idea
what's in the blood?

131
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:45,156
Worst case scenario,
it's a biological or a chemical agent.

132
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:48,278
The FBI has been alerted
in case this is bioterrorism.

133
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:50,974
I know. I'm on my way
to the hospital CEO, right now.

134
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:53,334
- What can we do to help?
- The people who have access

135
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:54,668
to those blood units

136
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:57,651
all claim no involvement
or knowledge.

137
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:59,834
I need to know who we can trust.

138
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,190
- Should we get Lightman back here?
- I can take care of this.

139
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:06,000
- Hey.
- Hey. What have you got?

140
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:09,066
The tainted blood units all came from
the overnight shift at the blood banks.

141
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:10,835
There were 2 techs on duty.

142
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:13,569
We're taking them down
to the Lightman Group for questioning.

143
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:17,642
Dr. Cho, I haven't forgotten about you.
As soon as I have a minute, we'll talk.

144
00:08:18,723 --> 00:08:20,645
That little boy
has sickle cell anemia.

145
00:08:20,728 --> 00:08:23,288
If he doesn't have a blood transfusion
in the next 24 hours,

146
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:24,529
he could have a stroke.

147
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:26,285
What if we get the blood
from elsewhere?

148
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:28,930
There's a real shortage, we're working
on it, but it's gonna take time

149
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:30,212
we don't have.

150
00:08:30,353 --> 00:08:33,053
Jack, thank God you're here.
Do you know Dr. Foster?

151
00:08:33,522 --> 00:08:35,272
Gillian, lovely surprise.

152
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:39,212
- What are you doing here?
- The CDC contacted the Rader firm

153
00:08:39,295 --> 00:08:41,436
to help assist you
since Dr. Lightman isn't here.

154
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:42,855
Where is Cal?

155
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,983
- He's on vacation.
- And hell didn't freeze over?

156
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:51,363
Now it's a shame he's gone. I was hoping
he and I could bury the hatchet.

157
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,738
- Is there a problem?
- Lightman and I are...

158
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:57,406
friendly rivals, so to speak.
It won't be a problem.

159
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:58,709
Will it?

160
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:01,416
Not at all.

161
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:08,234
The 2 techs from the blood bank
are here.

162
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:10,537
So tell me,
what's the deal with Lightman and Rader?

163
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,668
What,
they don't get along or something?

164
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:13,667
Cal...

165
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:14,999
despises him.

166
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,299
He thinks all he cares about
is money and publicity.

167
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,224
For once I'm with Lightman on this.

168
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:21,492
Something tells me
not to trust that guy.

169
00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:27,167
- Hey.
- Hi.

170
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,608
You're the detective
in charge of the Seeger case?

171
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,821
I'm Emily Lightman.
This is Dr. Cal Lightman.

172
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:35,131
He's a deception expert

173
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:38,243
- and he works along with the police...
- In the United States.

174
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:40,810
- This is Mexico.
- No, I knew that.

175
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:42,164
I knew it.

176
00:09:43,273 --> 00:09:45,254
I saw some news footage,

177
00:09:45,883 --> 00:09:48,758
and I think that the bartender
at Marla Seeger's hotel

178
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:51,777
is giving false information
about her disappearance.

179
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,759
Dr. Lightman, there is no case here.

180
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,217
We spoke to several
resort employees.

181
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,358
They said she seemed unstable,
more than likely a drug user.

182
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:00,363
Based on what?

183
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:02,486
We found several used
needles in her hotel room.

184
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,677
She probably found
a fellow drug user, left with him.

185
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,808
She will be back
when the drugs run out.

186
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,603
I still think you should have another go
at the bartender.

187
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,529
And I think that you and your daughter
should have a very lovely time here.

188
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:20,649
No, what about the guy
that Tyler said her mom was gonna meet?

189
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:24,053
- You spoke to Tyler?
- Yeah.

190
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:30,837
There're many people here who'd not like
you have shown interest in this matter.

191
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,228
Do you understand me?
I'm gonna give you one piece of advice.

192
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,343
Stay out of this.

193
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:46,541
Mojito, por favor.

194
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:47,924
And a margarita.

195
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,559
A coke.

196
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,991
Coke for the señorita.
Enjoying your vacation, señor?

197
00:10:53,074 --> 00:10:55,578
Yeah, well, no. I was
until that woman turned up missing.

198
00:10:55,661 --> 00:10:56,975
What's her name again?

199
00:10:57,445 --> 00:10:59,241
- Marla Seeger.
- That's it!

200
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,770
You're the guy on the TV, right?

201
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:03,985
You saw her that night?

202
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:05,830
What do you think happened to her?

203
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:08,068
She was dancing
with many different men.

204
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:10,877
- She's looking for a good time.
- She left with one of them.

205
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,057
They were sleeping on the beach
or getting high.

206
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,474
What did he look like,
the guy she left with?

207
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:17,715
Don't let this trouble
get in your head, señor.

208
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:19,248
Everything is fine.

209
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:27,436
You're an awful liar,

210
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:28,991
Miguel.

211
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,440
Now you're terrified.
What is it?

212
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:35,953
You work for the police?

213
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:50,274
I'm so sorry, we are closing this bar
while we restock.

214
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,190
Is there a problem?

215
00:11:54,451 --> 00:11:57,377
If you're here on vacation,
please tell us whatever we can do

216
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,235
to make your stay more enjoyable.

217
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,263
If, however,
you're here conducting an investigation,

218
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,014
you're not welcome here.

219
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:11,394
Torres, it's me.
I need you down here.

220
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:12,789
<i>Wait, that's for why?</i>

221
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,566
It's a woman's gone missing.

222
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:18,924
I'll tell you all when you get down.
Just bring something pretty to wear.

223
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:21,579
Dude, you're gonna find her.

224
00:12:21,662 --> 00:12:24,282
For you,
I will move heaven and earth.

225
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:28,694
Lightman just called. He needs me
to fly down to Zulia right now.

226
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:31,021
- He's on a case?
- A woman's missing.

227
00:12:31,104 --> 00:12:32,154
I gotta go.

228
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:34,038
He's on vacation!

229
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,250
Just give me one sec.

230
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:40,738
So, how is it working for Cal?

231
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:43,440
- Been so long, I can't remember.
- I work with Cal.

232
00:12:43,523 --> 00:12:45,761
- I'm an equity partner, you know.
- Good for you.

233
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:47,896
That means Cal's been working
on his control issues.

234
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:50,310
- Jack...
- I meant that as a compliment. Really.

235
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:53,753
He's my mentor. I have nothing
but respect and admiration for the man.

236
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:56,139
Obviously,
he doesn't feel the same about me.

237
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:58,402
Cal says he taught you just enough
to be dangerous.

238
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:00,320
He's the better scientist, no doubt.

239
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:01,904
I'm not going to apologize

240
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:04,069
for having ambition
and a better business sense.

241
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:06,326
If we're gonna work together,
I have some ground rules.

242
00:13:06,706 --> 00:13:08,245
First, I'm the boss around here.

243
00:13:08,658 --> 00:13:11,508
Second, don't try using me
to get back at Cal.

244
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,224
So long as you...

245
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:17,212
admit that there's just
the tiniest moment happening right now.

246
00:13:17,744 --> 00:13:19,244
Will you admit that?

247
00:13:20,088 --> 00:13:22,467
Romeo and Juliet,
you want to get this show on the road?

248
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:24,219
People could be dying right now.

249
00:13:28,614 --> 00:13:30,724
You can leave.
Thank you for coming.

250
00:13:30,807 --> 00:13:33,022
Agt. Reynolds, could you escort him out
and bring Ms. Bynes

251
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,689
- to a more private room?
- Sure. Will you come with me, please?

252
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:39,730
People hiding something never want
to draw attention to themselves.

253
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:40,862
That was awesome.

254
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,447
The old routine's a little rusty,
but she still works.

255
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,290
I meant what I said
about the ground rules.

256
00:13:45,373 --> 00:13:47,073
And I meant what I said.

257
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,250
Shall we go find out
what Ms. Bynes's hiding?

258
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:51,739
Nice work.

259
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:59,217
It was a regular night
at the blood bank. Nothing unusual.

260
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,700
Your boss was about to fire you
for being late too often.

261
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:05,823
You knew.

262
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:08,167
Was this retaliation?

263
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,430
She's breathing faster.
Foster's getting somewhere.

264
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:12,663
You have no idea how good she is.

265
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:14,132
Lightman doesn't know.

266
00:14:14,215 --> 00:14:17,765
He's a hard time seeing
the true potential of his employees.

267
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:21,525
What was that?

268
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:25,124
Little flash of anger
at the infallible Cal Lightman?

269
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,134
You run this entire lab.

270
00:14:27,217 --> 00:14:30,637
But I'll bet Lightman's never showed you
an ounce of appreciation.

271
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,199
So,

272
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:33,784
you and Lightman...

273
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:36,377
you had a falling-out,
what, over a case?

274
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,310
Water under the bridge now.

275
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:42,783
I never knew my own worth
until I got out from under Cal's shadow.

276
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,831
Someday, you'll do that same.

277
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:46,958
<i>It's been hard for me.
My husband left us.</i>

278
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,228
<i>I'm alone with the kids.</i>

279
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:50,847
- Voice pitch is higher.
- What's that look there? Shame?

280
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:54,809
I just went through a divorce
myself.

281
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:57,600
I can barely get out of bed.

282
00:14:57,683 --> 00:15:00,482
I can't think straight,
I can't do my job right...

283
00:15:01,973 --> 00:15:03,318
people are dying.

284
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:06,916
You feel guilty,
but you're gonna feel worse

285
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:09,749
if you keep secrets
and another person dies.

286
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:17,541
On my last shift, I didn't run
the full testing protocol on the blood.

287
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:20,252
You have to test on any blood
for different diseases.

288
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,547
I left early. My daughter needed me.

289
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:26,583
There are so many other safeguards.
I didn't think...

290
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,467
I just...

291
00:15:32,122 --> 00:15:34,629
- I think we have our culprit.
- No, we don't.

292
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:38,166
Someone else just died
after a transfusion at Euclid Park.

293
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:41,898
And this patient banked his own blood.
Central blood bank isn't responsible.

294
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,260
You're setting me up on a blind date
with a potential murderer?

295
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:49,986
Why? He's not your type?

296
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:51,741
I'll keep an eye on you.
You'll be fine.

297
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:55,251
- What are the police doing?
- Nothing.

298
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:58,581
So, we're doing this on our own.

299
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,154
You pulled me off a really big case.
The cdc brought in the Rader firm...

300
00:16:02,237 --> 00:16:03,169
Jack Rader?

301
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,839
He's at the office working with Foster.
What's the problem?

302
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:07,259
Not sure.

303
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:08,842
Get in.

304
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,594
Want to see the sights?

305
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,043
My daughter said she saw you.

306
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:16,376
Who you with?
You with the hotel?

307
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:18,767
Police?

308
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:22,023
Drug cartel?

309
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,009
Who's that guy?

310
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,655
He's with the police or drug cartel.

311
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:38,330
Dont go anywhere.

312
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:58,726
- How did you find me here?
- I bribed a waitress at the hotel.

313
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,020
The wrong part of town to visit.

314
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,022
You think I should call the cops,
then?

315
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,693
You scared of being seen with me
by the police, are you?

316
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:22,957
The police told us to say the lady
was looking for a good time,

317
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:25,460
- that it was her own fault.
- Why?

318
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:27,335
Zulia depends on tourists.

319
00:17:27,418 --> 00:17:29,673
Something bad happens,
you all disappear, the town dies.

320
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,456
After the lady from Miami
disappeared,

321
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:33,677
we were told
not to talk to anyone about...

322
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,055
What lady from Miami?

323
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,436
Do you want me to call the cops,
or...

324
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:45,939
she came here 4 months ago.

325
00:17:46,626 --> 00:17:47,838
She was found dead.

326
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,360
The police kept it out of the news.

327
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:53,822
We should get out of here.
I'm gonna tell the cabby we're ready.

328
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:04,477
Did you...

329
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,500
really see Marla Seeger at the bar?

330
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:10,342
I saw her with one man.

331
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:12,671
I'm not sure
if she left with him or not.

332
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:14,273
Was it this guy?

333
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:18,434
That's him.

334
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:19,833
I'm positive.

335
00:18:20,313 --> 00:18:21,313
Now go.

336
00:18:21,454 --> 00:18:22,504
Cab's gone.

337
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:24,415
What?

338
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:25,968
The cab, it's gone.

339
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,650
Hold that.

340
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:33,653
I'll give...

341
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,608
200 dollars

342
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:37,866
to the person
that gives us a ride back

343
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,184
to our hotel.

344
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:48,631
Where's your car?

345
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:59,854
We're lucky they didn't kill us
and dump our bodies in a ditch.

346
00:18:59,937 --> 00:19:01,152
That wasn't luck.

347
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:04,213
The driver was happy
to make some honest money for a change.

348
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:05,789
You read that?

349
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:08,459
Speaking of big and flashy...

350
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,606
I need you to find out
what Rader's up to.

351
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,977
- You want me to spy for you?
- No, I don't want you to spy for me.

352
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,655
I just want you to poke about a bit.
I'll do my own spying.

353
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:21,161
All right. It's just my opinion, but
I think that might be a little overkill.

354
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,536
Your opinion? I don't need your opinion.
I didn't ask for it.

355
00:19:23,826 --> 00:19:25,426
Just do it. All right?

356
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,716
Wait here.

357
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:43,629
That's my daughter!

358
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:45,996
- That's my daughter.
- She started talking to me.

359
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,989
You're having a conversation
with my teenage daughter!

360
00:19:49,072 --> 00:19:50,872
She started talking to me.

361
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:52,676
What?

362
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,409
All right. I'm leaving.

363
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:58,321
Dad, that was the guy
that Tyler's been emailing.

364
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:01,119
I know it was, and you shouldn't
have been talking to him. Bloody hell!

365
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:04,002
- You never said I shouldn't talk to him.
- What am I supposed to do?

366
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:06,574
Tell you not to do every
potentially life-threatening thing?

367
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,764
- I figured if I kept him talking...
- This is the last thing I need, Emily.

368
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:12,127
You know, I've got a con man
back in my office!

369
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,588
And I've got you
behaving like Nancy bloody Drew!

370
00:20:17,337 --> 00:20:19,137
I was just trying to help.

371
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:23,135
Where are you going?

372
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,550
Don't.

373
00:20:58,324 --> 00:20:59,406
I'm lola.

374
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,539
Jerry conway.

375
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,032
Please.

376
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,308
Thank you.

377
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:08,619
You're a very confident woman, Lola.

378
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:10,768
I mean that
in the most flattering way.

379
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:13,900
Then color me flattered.

380
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:17,650
So, how long you been a masseuse?

381
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:20,820
Just a couple of years.

382
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:21,944
Really?

383
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,595
No, seriously. The last guy I dated
was a complete nut job.

384
00:21:35,678 --> 00:21:37,428
- I've been there.
- Really?

385
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:42,168
Tell me about your last psycho,
I'll tell you about mine.

386
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:44,339
Least interesting story
does a body shot.

387
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:45,870
You're on.

388
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:50,700
I met this weird chick,
Marla, a couple nights ago.

389
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:55,143
The hospitals trade blood with each
other, but Euclid Park's not at fault.

390
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:58,799
I've been here 10 years. Yager's been
here 9. We've never had a problem.

391
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:00,900
We're not the source
of the tainted blood.

392
00:22:01,895 --> 00:22:03,248
How can you be sure?

393
00:22:05,414 --> 00:22:08,133
<i>I can't imagine how.
There's been no change in procedure.</i>

394
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,775
<i>There's been no change in procedure.</i>

395
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:45,639
Dr. Foster, here's the blue file
that you needed.

396
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,551
Sorry for the delay.

397
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:48,684
The blue file?

398
00:22:50,217 --> 00:22:51,105
Thank you.

399
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:55,562
Do you know what this is, Mr. Dunst?

400
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,625
This is a file all about you.

401
00:22:58,563 --> 00:23:00,797
Background check,
interviews with coworkers,

402
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,084
family, friends.

403
00:23:02,454 --> 00:23:05,072
My team compiled it.
You know, we can scour this

404
00:23:05,155 --> 00:23:06,715
to discover what you're hiding,

405
00:23:07,748 --> 00:23:09,553
<i>but why don't you save us the time?</i>

406
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:22,836
Tomkins, the new driver
in the lab, is a felon.

407
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:26,449
He told Yager he left the conviction
off his job application.

408
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:28,406
And I should have
reported it, but...

409
00:23:29,244 --> 00:23:30,700
Maybe you should talk to him.

410
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:53,186
He's married, goes online to meet women
while he's on business trips.

411
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:56,088
He's a schmuck, but he had nothing to do
with Marla's disappearance.

412
00:23:56,432 --> 00:23:58,110
- Are you sure?
- Positive. They met.

413
00:23:58,193 --> 00:23:59,653
She left after like a minute.

414
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:02,686
He says that she was crying
and talking to some couple in the lobby.

415
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:03,927
He seems truthful.

416
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,147
I can't believe you told him
I like role-playing and dirty limericks.

417
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:11,020
Don't knock it
until you've tried it.

418
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:14,656
Hang on.

419
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:17,995
You following me?

420
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:24,379
You have a lovely friend
and daughter.

421
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:28,216
Is that a threat? 'cause you really
shouldn't be confusing on that.

422
00:24:29,165 --> 00:24:30,838
Not at all, Dr. Lightman.

423
00:24:38,572 --> 00:24:41,498
You sent someone to follow me,
and they threatened my daughter.

424
00:24:42,288 --> 00:24:44,091
I didn't hire him.
Some people here do.

425
00:24:45,122 --> 00:24:46,631
So do the drug cartels.

426
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:48,736
I warned you not to get involved.

427
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:52,045
All right. 4 months ago,
another woman went missing,

428
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:55,082
just like Marla Seeger,
but this one turned up dead.

429
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:59,580
OK, listen. I insist
that you stop interfering. OK?

430
00:25:00,047 --> 00:25:03,254
The night Marla Seeger disappeared,
she met a man named Jerry Conway.

431
00:25:03,553 --> 00:25:05,999
Then she met a couple outside the bar.
Did you know that?

432
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:08,214
There is no case here.

433
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,843
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a young
woman who killed her own mother.

434
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:24,775
I think you should talk to this boy.

435
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,691
He's using his anger
to hide something.

436
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,459
She's protecting him,
so just talk to the boy.

437
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:42,665
How many of your people
are involved in this cover-up?

438
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,375
There is no cover-up.

439
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,587
You may not be a part of it,
but you know one exists, don't you?

440
00:25:52,681 --> 00:25:56,179
The couple that met Marla Seeger
say that she seemed unstable.

441
00:25:56,984 --> 00:25:58,167
You talked to them?

442
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:00,780
Well, who are they?

443
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,728
Dan and Stacy Felder.
But it's a dead end.

444
00:26:04,302 --> 00:26:05,810
You know, there is a case here.

445
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:08,972
Actually, there's 2.
But you already knew that, didn't you?

446
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:14,005
You lucky you survive
to this accident.

447
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:17,643
Why did you fail to mention your
criminal history on your application?

448
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:19,332
I was 19 when i stole that car.

449
00:26:19,818 --> 00:26:21,913
If I say I'm a felon,
who's gonna hire me?

450
00:26:22,392 --> 00:26:24,248
They should have done
a background check.

451
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,243
You've been in health care
for a while.

452
00:26:27,095 --> 00:26:29,806
- Do you enjoy it?
- It's very rewarding.

453
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,870
I missed my calling.
I should have been a paramedic.

454
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:39,847
I mean, the action, the glory...
I mean, this...

455
00:26:41,648 --> 00:26:44,605
- That's real life-and-death stuff.
- It's not too late.

456
00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:46,103
I'm too old.

457
00:26:46,845 --> 00:26:48,922
I don't know how we get
to where we're going.

458
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:50,895
<i>Are we even aware of our choices?</i>

459
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:54,151
- What, are they just chatting?
- We're just getting a baseline now.

460
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,490
You know, let me ask you something.

461
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,462
Was your "aha" moment
when you stole that car?

462
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:03,204
I don't understand the question.

463
00:27:03,897 --> 00:27:07,625
You stole that car and got into
an accident with a 23-year-old kid.

464
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:11,254
The police found you
cradling his mangled body.

465
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,673
Did you get into health care
because you realized

466
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,262
you could be around blood and
guts and death all the time?

467
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:20,513
That you wouldn't have to cause
an accident to get sexually stimulated?

468
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,358
Sicko alert.

469
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:28,468
Pupils dilated. He's aroused.

470
00:27:28,765 --> 00:27:30,648
From talking about blood and guts?

471
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,483
Yeah. They've sussed that out.

472
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,070
What did you put in the blood
at Euclid Park hospital?

473
00:27:36,677 --> 00:27:39,757
- Nothing.
- You want people to suffer and die.

474
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,264
I swear I had nothing to do
with the tainted blood.

475
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:44,233
I never did anything at Euclid Park.

476
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,631
Speech pattern's back to baseline.
He's probably telling the truth.

477
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,630
So, we're back to square one,

478
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:57,688
again.

479
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,111
- Why are you being so hard on yourself?
- People are dying,

480
00:28:04,194 --> 00:28:06,325
I can't stop thinking
about that boy with sickle cell,

481
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:08,980
and I have nothing for the CDC.
If Cal were here,

482
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,979
he would have solved this by now.
I should have just made him come back.

483
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,801
We can do this, OK?

484
00:28:13,884 --> 00:28:15,996
Excuse me.
You can't come in here. Jack.

485
00:28:16,925 --> 00:28:18,747
McKenzie!
How did you get in here?

486
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,663
I'm a reporter who talked her way
into Attica once, remember?

487
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:25,411
Scheduled surgeries are being canceled
all over DC with no explanation.

488
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:27,293
Something's going on at the CDC.

489
00:28:27,376 --> 00:28:30,334
And when a little bird told me you were
partnering with the Lightman Group,

490
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,751
my reporter antenna went off.

491
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,560
You have uncanny timing.
Let me fill you in.

492
00:28:36,825 --> 00:28:38,276
Can we do it on camera?

493
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:07,278
Yeah. Thank you very much.
I'll tell him. All right. Thanks.

494
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,081
So, a woman named
Ramona Posner came here

495
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,291
alone from Miami about 4 months ago.

496
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,461
Ten days after she disappeared,
she was found dead in an alley downtown.

497
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:18,070
State department and local police
ruled it an accident.

498
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:21,295
Well, a cynic
might call it a pattern.

499
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,054
By the way, Rader seems to be making
quite an impression at the office.

500
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,931
- Is he, now?
- According to loker,

501
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,724
Foster seems a bit gaga over him.

502
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,059
Lovely.

503
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:31,713
- God.
- What?

504
00:29:31,796 --> 00:29:33,234
- Is that jealousy?
- No.

505
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,484
Where are you going?

506
00:29:40,264 --> 00:29:43,708
I left my hat out by the pool. Don't
worry, I won't do anything childish.

507
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:50,150
Why don't you take your extraordinary
powers of observation

508
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:52,331
down to the pool and use them
to keep an eye on Emily?

509
00:29:58,722 --> 00:29:59,875
You're jealous.

510
00:30:03,229 --> 00:30:04,909
Marla came up to us in the lobby.

511
00:30:04,992 --> 00:30:07,639
She said, "I hope you
experience the great joy I have",

512
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,598
and then she left.
It was bizarre.

513
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:13,800
You work with the police, right?
Didn't they tell you this already?

514
00:30:13,883 --> 00:30:15,729
But I wanted to hear this
from you two.

515
00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:20,401
Mrs Felder, do you have any idea
why she would approach you like that?

516
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:24,947
Not true.

517
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:27,241
We're gonna be late for the airport.

518
00:30:29,074 --> 00:30:32,351
- No, I'll hold that.
- No, I'll get it. I'll get it.

519
00:30:35,027 --> 00:30:37,460
You know, you're never
gonna get that through customs.

520
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:38,440
Why not?

521
00:30:38,523 --> 00:30:41,647
Because I'm gonna call them. I'm gonna
tell them you got a suspicious package.

522
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,717
That's the kind of pain in the ass
I can be if I don't get the truth.

523
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,857
It was just a hunch.

524
00:30:51,562 --> 00:30:55,273
There's a fertility center here
that matches egg donors with couples.

525
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:58,511
We're from Canada and it's illegal
to purchase eggs there.

526
00:30:59,078 --> 00:31:02,485
The donors stay anonymous, but they
can choose who they want to donate to.

527
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,674
These are our frozen embryos.

528
00:31:05,757 --> 00:31:08,124
So you thought that Marla Seeger
was your egg donor.

529
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:10,568
For a moment. But then
we realized that it couldn't be her.

530
00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:13,370
She was nothing like the person
the broker described to us.

531
00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:25,633
You find my mom?

532
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:28,800
Not yet.

533
00:31:32,744 --> 00:31:33,649
That's lovely.

534
00:31:33,732 --> 00:31:36,672
Welcome to the age when they need you
but think they're smarter than you.

535
00:31:37,587 --> 00:31:38,844
She always was.

536
00:31:40,368 --> 00:31:41,933
All right, I've got one for you.

537
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:46,425
Marla Seeger was a waitress
in a diner, right?

538
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:52,467
Ramona Posner was a teacher's aide.

539
00:31:53,218 --> 00:31:56,753
How do two women like that
afford fabulous trips to Zulia?

540
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,422
How?

541
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,963
Marla Seeger came here
as an egg donor.

542
00:32:04,763 --> 00:32:06,984
She was giving herself
hormone injections.

543
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:08,968
Right. And the needles
that the cops found.

544
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,683
Hence the mood swings.

545
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:16,058
- Can I help you?
- Cal Lightman?

546
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,643
Yeah, he's here.

547
00:32:18,492 --> 00:32:19,938
Just the man I wanted to see.

548
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,481
You need to call in some
of those embassy resources.

549
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,814
Can't.

550
00:32:23,897 --> 00:32:27,278
Someone from the police department
called my boss. I've been reassigned.

551
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:31,757
And threatened.

552
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:39,301
Our egg donors have high IQs,
are from stable backgrounds.

553
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:42,106
They don't have drug, alcohol,
or mental health problems,

554
00:32:42,189 --> 00:32:43,836
and many of them are star athletes.

555
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,260
How specific can we be
in how the donors look?

556
00:32:46,343 --> 00:32:49,102
I have a couple here,
they're seeking someone at least 5'9",

557
00:32:49,185 --> 00:32:51,618
blond, blue-eyed, athletic,
and an Ivy League school.

558
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:54,372
We found a match yesterday.
It's only 50,000.

559
00:32:54,455 --> 00:32:56,283
In the states,
it would be double that.

560
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,512
We're in here.

561
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,386
How do you harvest the eggs, then?

562
00:33:01,203 --> 00:33:04,047
Our reproductive endocrinologist,
Dr. Alvarez,

563
00:33:04,877 --> 00:33:06,751
he's responsible for everything.

564
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:11,041
- How much do you pay the donors?
- The fee is generous.

565
00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:14,457
Plus they get a free trip to Zulia.
But no one does it for the money.

566
00:33:15,134 --> 00:33:17,694
They just want to help
the right couples have a child.

567
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,838
- That's wonderful, that's wonderful.
- Yeah, it's great.

568
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:24,854
We actually are looking for a donor
with blue eyes and light-brown hair.

569
00:33:25,184 --> 00:33:26,329
And 5'6".

570
00:33:32,028 --> 00:33:33,594
I think I can arrange that.

571
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,155
Thought you were gonna say that.

572
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,474
Dr. Alvarez, these are the Garrs.

573
00:33:39,528 --> 00:33:40,689
Pleased to meet you.

574
00:33:41,863 --> 00:33:43,228
May I talk to you, please?

575
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:44,897
Can it wait?

576
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,771
No, no. We've gotta
shove off anyway.

577
00:33:48,854 --> 00:33:50,553
- We gotta go.
- We've got to think.

578
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:52,425
Yes. I mean, it's a big decision.

579
00:33:53,871 --> 00:33:55,937
I've got a question for you,
Dr. Alvarez.

580
00:33:56,957 --> 00:33:58,846
We've been told
that my wife's infertility

581
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:02,831
is due to an estrogen imbalance
caused by the coriolis effect.

582
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:04,469
Is that possible?

583
00:34:04,914 --> 00:34:06,386
That could very well be true.

584
00:34:07,252 --> 00:34:09,918
Did you see Wynn when I described Marla?
Flared nostrils, quick breath?

585
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:12,124
- He's in this.
- There's no way all those donors

586
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:14,895
- fit the criteria he described.
- Wait. See, they don't have to.

587
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:18,377
They find donors like Marla Seeger
who are desperate for money.

588
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,744
They insist the donors
remain anonymous.

589
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:23,111
Wynn can give the buyers
any description he wants.

590
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,340
- It's a con.
- Yeah, absolutely it's a con.

591
00:34:27,557 --> 00:34:30,430
Isn't the coriolis effect
something about the earth's rotation?

592
00:34:30,513 --> 00:34:32,903
- Exactly.
- Alvarez agreed with your theory.

593
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:35,869
That's because Alvarez is not a doctor.
He's a fake.

594
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:41,054
<i>I'm in charge of blood orders here,
and Yager coordinates trades.</i>

595
00:34:41,137 --> 00:34:42,497
<i>For the other hospitals in DC.</i>

596
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,984
So why did I have to reinterview
these two guys?

597
00:34:47,225 --> 00:34:49,002
Because we've got nothing else.

598
00:34:51,444 --> 00:34:53,581
He's exhibiting extreme control.

599
00:34:53,664 --> 00:34:55,299
He could still be hiding something.

600
00:34:55,382 --> 00:34:58,137
No, voice pitch is steady.
Dunst isn't lying.

601
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,639
But why does Yager
keep looking behind him?

602
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,366
And why is he anxious?

603
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,226
What'd I miss?

604
00:35:04,994 --> 00:35:07,563
- What happened to the reporter?
- I took care of her.

605
00:35:07,727 --> 00:35:09,231
That could mean so many things.

606
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:13,861
- So the story won't be on the news?
- That's what you wanted, right?

607
00:35:14,978 --> 00:35:17,085
Did Cal brainwash you
into thinking I'm kind of

608
00:35:17,168 --> 00:35:18,819
media whore without scruples?

609
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:23,125
Come on, tell me you got something,
'cause the tox screen's all negative.

610
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:26,242
And the CDC is getting
all kind of calls from reporters.

611
00:35:26,636 --> 00:35:29,515
I can charm one reporter, I can't
control the entire fourth estate.

612
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,464
<i>We had the 5-car pile-up
on the beltway...</i>

613
00:35:34,112 --> 00:35:34,915
Wait.

614
00:35:36,207 --> 00:35:37,342
Something's different.

615
00:35:37,997 --> 00:35:40,512
I had to change the battery,
so we took a little break.

616
00:35:41,028 --> 00:35:44,642
But they're both more relaxed now,
and Yager's not looking behind him.

617
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,595
Go back to before the break.

618
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:54,497
He was looking at that.

619
00:35:57,709 --> 00:35:58,862
They got rid of it.

620
00:35:59,553 --> 00:36:01,207
Why didn't they want us to see it?

621
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,434
- What can we do for you?
- We need to take a look around.

622
00:36:17,495 --> 00:36:18,959
How often do you give blood?

623
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:22,745
Every 6 weeks or so. I have a rare
blood type. What are you looking for?

624
00:36:22,828 --> 00:36:24,737
- Found it.
- That's sensitive equipment.

625
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,874
What's it for?

626
00:36:26,136 --> 00:36:27,889
Processing patient fluid samples.

627
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,905
Could you be any more vague?

628
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:33,524
It's positive for narcotics.

629
00:36:34,857 --> 00:36:36,847
So you've been running
a drug lab down here.

630
00:36:47,424 --> 00:36:48,956
Where's Marla Seeger?

631
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:52,061
- I don't know who that is.
- Not true.

632
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:55,267
You're the couple
from the office today, no?

633
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,118
Your partner Wynn sold you out,
made a deal with the police.

634
00:36:58,201 --> 00:37:00,101
He said the scam was your idea.

635
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:02,337
He never said that.

636
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,835
<i>Dr. Alvarez is responsible
for everything.</i>

637
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:10,102
- A lie.
- I can assure you

638
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,373
it's perfectly true.
What happened to her?

639
00:37:15,037 --> 00:37:17,442
She was one of our egg donors.

640
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:20,195
She wasn't doing well
on the hormone treatments.

641
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,695
She wanted to get the procedure
over with. Then she changed her mind.

642
00:37:24,435 --> 00:37:26,720
Wynn brought her in anyway.
This is all his doing.

643
00:37:26,803 --> 00:37:28,119
What happened to Marla?

644
00:37:30,044 --> 00:37:33,489
I started the egg extraction,
but there were complications and

645
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:35,377
I punctured something.

646
00:37:35,816 --> 00:37:37,105
She started to bleed.

647
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:39,214
So where is she?

648
00:37:41,123 --> 00:37:42,593
Wynn has an apartment.

649
00:37:43,326 --> 00:37:44,370
She's dying.

650
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,247
One more day,
we would have lost her.

651
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,400
Listen, how did you know
that I wasn't part of the coverup?

652
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,846
When I accused you,
you showed genuine anger, not guilt.

653
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:08,114
About that man you sent
to threaten my daughter.

654
00:38:08,197 --> 00:38:09,848
That wasn't me, that was my boss.

655
00:38:13,646 --> 00:38:16,052
You sure this man
was part of the cartels?

656
00:38:16,135 --> 00:38:18,587
If I was you, I'd keep him
away from the evidence locker.

657
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,050
I'll keep an eye on my boss, too.

658
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:31,904
Rader and Foster busted a drug lab.
He's saying she's brilliant and has...

659
00:38:31,987 --> 00:38:33,525
All right, keep it to yourself.

660
00:38:34,776 --> 00:38:36,690
Lou from the embassy
asked me to stay...

661
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,587
Lou from the embassy?
That's nice.

662
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,746
He asked me to stay few more days.
I said yeah, is that all right?

663
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:43,962
And here I was thinking
we were happily married.

664
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,208
The two techs were making
designer fentanyl in the hospital lab.

665
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,481
They were using the blood
as a means of transport.

666
00:38:50,564 --> 00:38:53,196
Liquid fentanyl was
injected into the blood bags,

667
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:56,891
which would then be delivered to all the
heroin processing centers in the city.

668
00:38:56,974 --> 00:38:59,761
A lab within a lab.
Pretty ingenious.

669
00:38:59,844 --> 00:39:02,609
Problem was, the new guy Tomkins
picked up the wrong bags one day.

670
00:39:02,692 --> 00:39:06,510
And the fentanyl never triggered any
alarms in the patient tox screen because

671
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:09,210
it's a common anesthetic
used for surgery.

672
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:10,369
Sorry I'm late.

673
00:39:11,538 --> 00:39:12,958
They filled you in?

674
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:15,397
I guess we'll reopen
the central blood bank

675
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,572
and track down all the units
that left Euclid Park hospital.

676
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,585
Thanks to you.

677
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:27,947
You should both know that I taped
an interview with McKenzie Dodd.

678
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:30,333
Should be airing in about an hour.

679
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:34,137
How could you do that?

680
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:37,079
The CDC hasn't had
the press conference.

681
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,051
I forgot.
You love the spotlight.

682
00:39:40,134 --> 00:39:42,113
I promised an exlcusive
to buy us time.

683
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:45,476
This was all about getting back at Cal
and the Lightman Hroup, wasn't it?

684
00:39:46,978 --> 00:39:48,552
You know me too well.

685
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:54,336
- It was fun.
- Bye, Jack.

686
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,879
Here's my card.

687
00:40:02,964 --> 00:40:05,038
In case you plan on making
a life change.

688
00:40:09,781 --> 00:40:11,199
Thanks, man.

689
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,527
<i>Well, it's been a very tense time,
but the threat has been eliminated.</i>

690
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,415
<i>Dr. Cho credits you with helping
a little boy with sickle cell anemia.</i>

691
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,275
I knew he was slick, but, man...

692
00:40:23,885 --> 00:40:26,900
<i>Could I just say that I owe a debt
of gratitude to Dr. Gillian Foster,</i>

693
00:40:26,983 --> 00:40:28,381
<i>who really cracked this case.</i>

694
00:40:28,464 --> 00:40:31,639
<i>This potential health disaster
wouldn't have been averted without her.</i>

695
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:42,866
Mommy!

696
00:40:59,768 --> 00:41:01,581
So you're saying that

697
00:41:01,664 --> 00:41:04,024
you can just treat me like a child
whenever you want to.

698
00:41:04,473 --> 00:41:07,488
No, I'm not.
I'm saying that on occasion,

699
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:11,865
it's my right as a parent
to be suspicious and overprotective.

700
00:41:12,488 --> 00:41:14,476
Then on occasion,
I reserve the right

701
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,308
to throw tantrums
and spend all your money.

702
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,641
Deal.

703
00:41:21,497 --> 00:41:25,291
Now, if you're done forcing me to work,
can i have my holiday back, please?

704
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:30,459
How do you learn to live longer?

705
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:34,546
Well, there's meditation and yoga,

706
00:41:34,629 --> 00:41:37,119
but for you,
I'd definitely say do both.

707
00:41:37,713 --> 00:41:41,151
Yoga's that thing you do in a lounge
chair with a mai-tai in your hand?

708
00:41:41,234 --> 00:41:42,509
Yeah, it is.

709
00:41:50,846 --> 00:41:53,252
"Don't hate me too much
because I'm filled with admiration."

710
00:41:53,335 --> 00:41:54,882
Give it to me.

711
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:58,810
So who sent the flowers, then?
Because you know I'm the jealous type.

712
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:01,586
Welcome home, Cal.
Rumor has it you never even left town,

713
00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:04,069
but that can't be true
because you look like a different man.

714
00:42:04,152 --> 00:42:05,697
I feel like a different man.

715
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,113
You know, a vacation is a
wonderful thing, 6 days of nothing.

716
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:11,515
Well, i heard you were working
on a case.

717
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:13,491
Well, it barely qualifies as a case.

718
00:42:14,335 --> 00:42:15,957
I feel so relaxed that...

719
00:42:16,638 --> 00:42:18,432
I don't even care
that Rader was here.

720
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,621
Then Torres told you.

721
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:26,965
He sent you the flowers, then?

722
00:42:30,662 --> 00:42:32,215
Have you checked them for aphids?

723
00:42:34,743 --> 00:42:36,006
No, no, I don't care.

724
00:42:37,565 --> 00:42:40,483
- Did he see any of my research?
- I kept him out of your library.

725
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:44,316
- And is everyone still here?
- He didn't poach anyone.

726
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:47,164
And did he break
into the office supply closet?

727
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:49,604
He definitely didn't do that.
Except one thing,

728
00:42:49,687 --> 00:42:51,776
the sprinkler system
was acting up a little bit.

729
00:42:52,825 --> 00:42:53,809
That's odd.

730
00:42:55,436 --> 00:42:57,491
What exactly happened
between you and Rader?

731
00:42:58,937 --> 00:42:59,863
I'd tell you,

732
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:01,703
but you'd think I was lying.

733
00:43:04,812 --> 00:43:08,069
My card. Just in case
you're thinking of making a life change.
