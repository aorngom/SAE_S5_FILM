1
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,876
This place is beautiful, Vincent.

2
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,609
You have really
outdone yourself.

3
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,742
Not bad for a kid
from Queens, huh?

4
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,116
Not bad for a kid from anywhere.
Who's gonna decorate?

5
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,417
I'm gonna do it.
You know I got a great eye.

6
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,924
- Lots of reds.
- Don't be an idiot, Drama.

7
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,789
You know, I almost went
to Parsons, Shauna.

8
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,455
What you mean you almost went
to Parsons? What does that mean?

9
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,862
Get out of here.

10
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,025
When are you gonna cut him
off already, huh?

11
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,194
You know you're doing him
a huge disservice.

12
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,602
Do you know that I carried
my brother for 15 years?

13
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,765
And now he's living in a van
outside of a Target.

14
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,105
- Really?
- We don't talk about him.

15
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,839
How about your decorator?
You know how much I love your place.

16
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,847
Carrie Carlson.
She's the best in the biz.

17
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,475
I guarantee you she'll get you
into "Architectural Digest."

18
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,418
Well, hook it up.
I'm gonna go christen the bathroom.

19
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,444
All right.
Congratulations, sweetie.

20
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,083
And to think this all started
from a Vicks commercial.

21
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,956
Amazing!

22
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,895
You guys are so fucked!

23
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,195
I bet you're gonna sink
at least three mil into this place.

24
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,997
I guessed five.

25
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:19,027
- You must be freaking out, Eric.
- Cool as a cucumber, Shauna.

26
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,563
- So not like you.
- If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

27
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,075
There you go, E.

28
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,339
Finally turning into a human being
I can hang out with.

29
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,778
See that? Things are finally starting
to pan out for me.

30
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,214
I think "Variety" is gonna run
the "Aquaman" announcement tomorrow.

31
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,718
- I'm hoping for the cover.
- Oh, cool. Don't let them use

32
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,050
- that smiley face picture.
- I love that picture.

33
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,646
Vince hates it.
It drives him crazy.

34
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,782
Use the "What the fuck
are you looking at?" shot.

35
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,793
Maybe we'll land him
the next Scorsese movie.

36
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,021
- That'd be nice.
- Nice.

37
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,994
I think we should turn
the pool to face south.

38
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,466
Very feng shui.

39
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,129
Will you just let the professionals
handle this stuff?

40
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,731
Shauna, obviously
you never saw my condo.

41
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,765
No, but I'm picturing
lots of leopard sheets and leather.

42
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,039
You know you should go easy
on me, Shauna.

43
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,568
I'm going in for surgery.

44
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,274
Surgery?
Are you okay?

45
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,976
It's elective.
I'd rather not talk about it.

46
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,316
He's having his botched
adult circumcision corrected.

47
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,350
Hey, Ronnie!
Yo, that 70" beast is for my room.

48
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,327
Vince only wanted a 50".

49
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,352
I swear to God!
Ask him.

50
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,558
- Hello.
- Yo, Suit.

51
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,229
Billy, how are you?

52
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,932
I'm fucking amazing!
Guess what?

53
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,100
- What, you finally showered?
- Fuck you.

54
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,110
- We got into Sundance!
- We got in!

55
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,544
- We got into Sundance!
- We're in, motherfucker!

56
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,140
Gonna be the first back-to-back winner
in the festival's history.

57
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,015
Vince, come here! Congratulations,
Billy. You did a great job.

58
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,043
If you go out tonight, call me.
We'll celebrate.

59
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,952
Absolutely.

60
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,254
- "Queens Blvd." got into Sundance.
- Wow. That's awesome.

61
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,089
We are having
a fuckin' good month!

62
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,118
Good job, E.

63
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,723
This and "Aquaman" will get us
the "Variety" cover for sure.

64
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,596
Sundance, baby.

65
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,898
Yeah. You did this.

66
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,603
- Hey, Lloyd.
- Hi.

67
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,074
Is he decent?

68
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,577
Eric, I'll deny I said this,
but no, he's not decent.

69
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,079
He's an awful human being.

70
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,876
You'll have to bring
your own thermals.

71
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,145
But I'll get you
on all the hot party lists.

72
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,778
Turtle did this.
Not bad, right?

73
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,850
You know "The Station
Agent," Eric?

74
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,724
- Yeah.
- Monster fuckin' hit at Sundance!

75
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,787
Did you see it? It's about the midget
who lives by the train tracks.

76
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,231
The last time I saw him,
he was in a FedEx commercial.

77
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,064
They were overnighting him
to London.

78
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,128
His name is Peter Dinklage. He's doing
a movie with Vin Diesel right now.

79
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,230
Really? Which one?
Is it "Twins Part Deux"?

80
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,902
You'll never give me credit
for anything, will you?

81
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,538
You got me. Are you kidding? Sundance
is a great festival for little people.

82
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,481
You should kill over there.
But for the rest of us normal folk,

83
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,245
it's just a chance to try
to fuck a Mormon.

84
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,277
Whoo! Pleasure as always, Ari.

85
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,118
- I'll see you on the slopes.
- Eric.

86
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,919
- Yeah?
- Sit down.

87
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,357
What's up?

88
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,822
It's about
the "Aquaman" offer.

89
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:00,196
- What about it?
- It's M.I.A.

90
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,293
- What do you mean?
- I mean we don't have it yet.

91
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,099
What do you mean?
We already had it.

92
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,698
We had it,
but we haven't gotten it.

93
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,674
We're waiting
on the paperwork, right?

94
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,336
Yeah, I've been waiting.

95
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,706
Okay, all right.
I'm missing something here.

96
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,808
- They made us an offer and we accepted.
- Uh-huh. Yup.

97
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,251
And you said we were waiting on
the paperwork. So what's goin' on?

98
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,381
- I don't know.
- Well pick up the phone and find out!

99
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,858
You don't think
that I've picked up the fucking phone?

100
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,691
- Well, pick it up again!
- I told you guys not to sit on this!

101
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,358
You know how much time was wasted
getting Drama on as his personal chef

102
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,924
and Turtle as his driver?
I mean, come on.

103
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,596
Ari, you realize that Vince
just bought a house for $5 million.

104
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,106
Was I the one that told you guys
to do a 10-day escrow?

105
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,502
Ari, find out
what the fuck is going on.

106
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,205
Call me. Please.

107
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,184
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,618
Dr. Green's office.

109
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:07,194
- Dr. Green?
- Yeah.

110
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,396
- He's good.
- The best.

111
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,370
Johnny Chase?

112
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,242
I'm just getting
my girlfriend something.

113
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,268
- As a gift.
- Oh, you have a girlfriend?

114
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,042
Yeah.

115
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,673
That's too bad.

116
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,455
So, tell me, Mr. Chase, why are you
interested in calf augmentation?

117
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,652
Well, Doc,
I've always felt top heavy.

118
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,422
Out of proportion.

119
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:38,726
You know, I work out every day
and they just don't grow.

120
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,063
Well, we're all victims
of our genetic heritage.

121
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,193
Yeah, well,
I was a double victim.

122
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,967
We used to say about Pops,
"No child support and no calves."

123
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,735
We can do it for you,
Mr. Chase.

124
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,403
But it is something that you
have to be very be sure of,

125
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,968
because this is
major surgery.

126
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,344
Doc, I'm an actor
by trade.

127
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,645
My legs
are my livelihood.

128
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,277
You know,
I've got great thighs,

129
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,946
very aesthetic knees.

130
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,116
And I feel pretty good
about my ankles.

131
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,422
It's just my calves
I can't live with.

132
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,754
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure
I want to do it.

133
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,959
Then I'll have Rita
schedule you in.

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,968
Excellent.

135
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,492
Thank you, Doc.

136
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,232
Pleasure.

137
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,333
Oh, Mr. Chase, the cost
of the operation will be $10,000.

138
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,743
Do you take
S.A.G. Insurance?

139
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,213
This is Michael
and Catherine's living room.

140
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,546
Oh, did they fight
over that rug.

141
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,644
Catherine's got all the T-mobile money
coming in right now.

142
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,678
- Bet she won, huh?
- Exactly.

143
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,519
Brad and Jen's master bath.

144
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:42,016
Heartbreaking, although I heard
they might be getting back together.

145
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:45,087
Carrie, you have any pictures
of Jen in the tub?

146
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,066
How 'bout I tell Brad Pitt
that you said that, Turtle?

147
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,261
- He'll kick your fuckin' ass.
- Please.

148
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,204
I don't think you get where
we come from, okay, Shauna?

149
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,332
I will slap Brad Pitt
in his face.

150
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,104
I don't know, Brad looked pretty
ripped in "Troy."

151
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,668
That's all C.G.I., Drama.

152
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,646
They're gonna make Vince look
ripped up in "Aquaman."

153
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,013
- Thanks, Turtle.
- David Schwimmer's kitchen.

154
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,042
Notice the accents
in the marble and the full line

155
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,816
- of Miele ovens and ranges.
- Mieles are awesome, Vince.

156
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,950
They go from 0-400°
in four seconds.

157
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,484
And they have a roast probe,
which is nice to have.

158
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,293
How have we lived this long
without a roast probe?

159
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,426
Look, Vince, the point with the house
is that it's yours.

160
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,835
And I work 24 hours a day, seven days
a week to make sure it feels that way.

161
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,340
- Sounds good. Let's do it.
- All right.

162
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,036
- What do you charge?
- It's a $150,000 retainer.

163
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,045
And then I get
10% of all purchases.

164
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,513
But I also get 20% off
all purchases.

165
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,709
So really, you're coming
out 10% ahead.

166
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,310
- That sounds fair. You take a check?
- Of course.

167
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,787
Actually, we're a little
low on cash flow right now.

168
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,620
- Maybe if there's...
- We're waiting for money to come in.

169
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,684
Big money, Carrie. You're gonna
be doing Aquaman's house.

170
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,457
Ooh, fancy.

171
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,431
We should get you guys an aquarium then.
I know the best place.

172
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,765
It's fine. We can get started.
I know you're good for the money.

173
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,640
Come on, Chris,
I painted your house for you.

174
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,540
You stiffed me three grand.

175
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:08,308
I would have forgotten about it
but I need the money right now.

176
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,645
You begged me
to paint my house, Drama,

177
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,777
and you fucked it up so bad
I had to pay somebody else to redo it,

178
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,686
and I still gave you $2,500
'cause I'm a generous guy!

179
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,952
Come on, Chris, we had a deal.
Don't make me beg.

180
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,152
What do you need this money for?
You in trouble?

181
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,423
No no, it's nothing
like that.

182
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,131
- It's elective surgery.
- What are you getting your nose done?

183
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,761
No, implants.

184
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,966
- Calf implants.
- You're sicker than I thought.

185
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,769
You gonna give me
the money or not?

186
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,208
Yeah, I'll give you
the money for a shrink.

187
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,378
You know what, fat boy?
I'll tell you what.

188
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,280
How 'bout I come in
there, I beat your ass

189
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,807
and then you give me
the money.

190
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,614
You're looking slow
in there, Chris.

191
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,747
You beat my ass
I'll give you the money.

192
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,257
All right.

193
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,123
I gotta warn you, Chris, I'm in the best
shape of my life right now.

194
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,961
You know every time we get
in the ring together

195
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,933
you end up
gettin' busted up.

196
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,608
Dana Gordon,
you made Junior VP

197
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,610
and I gotta wait three days
for a call back?

198
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,738
Sorry, Ari, we were moving offices.
You know how it is.

199
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,543
Where's the Vinny Chase offer?

200
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,846
- What are you...
- Dana?

201
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,875
Are you taking
a piss, Ari?

202
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,889
That check you wrote me
isn't going to bounce, is it?

203
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,449
No. I'd wait till Thursday
to cash it, though.

204
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,189
- Excuse me?
- I'm kidding. It's fine.

205
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,025
It is calming.

206
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,900
You know, Vince, Oscar De La Hoya has
a shark in his house.

207
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,996
Aquaman should
have one in his.

208
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,472
Yeah.
How much, Keith?

209
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,340
That guy right there is $6,500,
but he's a mutt.

210
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,971
You want a purebred White Tip,
it'll cost you around $11,000.

211
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,947
Maybe we should get two,
so they have a friend?

212
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,471
Definitely, man!
Look at that.

213
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,416
- What do you think, E?
- About what?

214
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,476
Getting a couple sharks
for the house?

215
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,250
- Well, how much is a shark?
- 11 grand.

216
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,154
You really think we need
a shark, Vince?

217
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,718
Yes, we do, E! And we should consider
gettin' some lobsters, too.

218
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,163
We get bored with 'em, Drama can throw
'em in that new oven we're getting.

219
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,792
It's Ari.
I'm gonna take this.

220
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,894
As much as I'd love to spend the rest
of my day with you guys, I must go.

221
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,201
I've got to drag Russell Crowe
out of Tom Bergin's.

222
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,208
He's got "Leno" tonight.

223
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,176
- See you.
- Ciao, beautiful.

224
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,973
Ciao.

225
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,708
- What's up, Ari?
- Just had lunch with Dana Gordon.

226
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,273
- What'd she say?
- Everything's going to be great.

227
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,751
Boss is in France.
He just has to sign off on the details.

228
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,948
- You believe her?
- I've known her a very long time.

229
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,786
Just stay calm.
We're gonna be okay.

230
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:35,419
I will be calm when Vince has that check
in his hands, okay, Ari?

231
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,657
Neurotic Irish fuck.

232
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,329
Here's your left implant!

233
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,896
Here's your right implant!

234
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,034
Left! Right!

235
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,841
And by the way,
I'm going to lose this weight,

236
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,779
but you're never going
to get smart.

237
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,680
Ask your fucking brother
for the money.

238
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,016
All right, Chris.
How about half the money?

239
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,419
I'm not just talking
about the fish.

240
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,324
I mean, to spend $50,000 on a tank
is insane. We don't even have a couch.

241
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,919
This morning this guy was
all for making the house nice.

242
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,759
We'll just wait
for Carrie's discount.

243
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,595
- She gets a discount on fish?
- Shauna says she's the best.

244
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,931
I think she gets a discount
on everything.

245
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,301
Hell, what the fuck
happened to you?

246
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,135
I just worked out
with Chris Penn.

247
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,936
Why do you always
work out with him?

248
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:26,934
- You catch a beating every time.
- No, this is nothing.

249
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:30,346
Look, bro, you know
I'd never ask you for anything,

250
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:33,818
but I'm in dire need
of 10 grand.

251
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,344
Drama, it's just
now's not a good time.

252
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,151
Vince has a lot
of expenses right now.

253
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,680
Is your name Vince?

254
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,920
Look, I've exhausted
all available options.

255
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,191
You know I'd never come
to you for money.

256
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,959
And you know I'd never
say no to you.

257
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,432
But, Johnny,
this is insane.

258
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,059
This is my life!

259
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,161
Are these things gonna
feel like fake tits?

260
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,934
- I'm not in the mood, Turtle.
- I'm just asking a question.

261
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,635
You think girls sit
around like us,

262
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,768
"You like a guy with
real calves or fake calves?"

263
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,642
As long as you go
underneath the muscle,

264
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,613
like with tits,
they have a natural feel.

265
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,707
So you've felt
a man's fake calf before?

266
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,718
- Ugh!
- Uh, listen Johnny.

267
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,879
I'll think about it,
all right?

268
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,820
- Vince.
- Yeah?

269
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,621
You know I love you,
right, bro?

270
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,184
I know. I know.

271
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,326
Oh yeah.
Sweet sweet sweet.

272
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,529
Yeah, we could drop
some serious coin in this place.

273
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,003
God, I hate shopping.

274
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,336
Hmm.
This is kind of comfy.

275
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,535
I could take a nap
right here.

276
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,875
Now that is the couch
of a movie star if I've ever seen one.

277
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,881
Josh Weinstein.
What's going on, man?

278
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,110
Hey, Sundance, baby!
We did it.

279
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,914
Don't forget, Josh Weinstein's the one
that found you that script.

280
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,420
- We remember.
- Great.

281
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,081
This is my girl Ima.

282
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,353
Did three episodes
of "North Shore" last year.

283
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,327
We're movin' in together.
Might even buy the same couch as you.

284
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,021
Okay, baby.
Go check out a lamp, okay?

285
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,966
- Seriously.
- Nice to meet you.

286
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,105
So, guys,
congrats on J.C.

287
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,902
That's a big score.

288
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,672
I mean, I love "Aquaman," but I didn't
think they could land a whale like that.

289
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,111
- What are you talking about?
- J.C., baby.

290
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,445
James Cameron's directing
"Aquaman."

291
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:14,009
What, you guys didn't know?
Ari is slackin'.

292
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:17,511
Well, just remember Josh
Weinstein told you first.

293
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,558
Yo, James Cameron, baby.

294
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,828
This could be the worst
piece-of-shit movie ever,

295
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,732
and it'll still make
a billion dollars.

296
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,861
I would give my left arm
to do a Cameron movie.

297
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,634
- How 'bout your left calf?
- Do you think it's true?

298
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,300
I don't know.
I can't find Ari.

299
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,936
You are on fire, E.
It's crazy.

300
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,845
You read these things and you can
never guess what it's gonna be.

301
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,678
But with a guy like James Cameron,

302
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,014
you know it's gonna be special.
I'm gonna call Ari again.

303
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,886
Ari Gold's office.

304
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,446
Lloyd, it's Eric Murphy.
I need to talk to Ari.

305
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,856
Eric, he told me
if I disturbed him,

306
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,088
he'd chop me up
Benihana style.

307
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:59,097
This is the most important phone call
you've ever had. I promise you.

308
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,294
Do you how many times I've told him
I'm Chinese? The man does not listen.

309
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,632
I don't care if he's in the middle
of open heart surgery.

310
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,934
- Get him on the phone!
- Okay, fine, E.

311
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,202
But it's just because you are

312
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,869
the only nice person
in this whole fucking town!

313
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,845
Thanks, Lloyd.

314
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,245
I would have to say
it's his anger.

315
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,842
I mean, he goes
from zero to 100 in a second flat.

316
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,351
- Come on.
- Do you feel this is

317
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,549
- an accurate assessment, Ari?
- No. I'm a very calm guy.

318
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,887
I mean, whether it's... that's...

319
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,487
I'm a very calm person,
all right?

320
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,396
Whether I'm at work
or in a social situation,

321
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,263
I am extremely calm.

322
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,166
But my wife,
who I love very dearly,

323
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,170
uh, she likes to nag,

324
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,468
and I react to the nagging.

325
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,168
Overreact.

326
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,339
Sometimes,
okay, maybe.

327
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,406
But without the nagging,

328
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,213
no reaction.

329
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,277
Well, what he
calls "nagging,"

330
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,221
I call trying to have
a relationship.

331
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,816
Look, there's
no proverbial judge

332
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,486
sitting on
a bench judging you.

333
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,519
Ari, I told you
to turn that off.

334
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,827
I did turn it off, but this
is the emergency line.

335
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,095
- This is the Bat Line.
- Do you need to get that?

336
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,534
- I do need to take this, yes.
- No, he doesn't.

337
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,539
I ask for one hour out of a day
for his undivided attention,

338
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,337
- and I can't even have that.
- You can have it if you want to live

339
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,640
in Agoura fucking Hills
and go to group therapy.

340
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,374
But if you want a Beverly Hills mansion
and a country club membership

341
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,041
and nine weeks a year
at a Tuscan villa,

342
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,574
then I'm gonna need to take a call
when it comes in at noon

343
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,779
on a motherfucking Wednesday!

344
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,413
See, that's it.
There it is.

345
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,584
You know what?
I have to take this.

346
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:39,386
There better be a Scud missile heading
towards Beverly Hills, Eric.

347
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,092
No, there's a fucking iceberg, Ari.

348
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,102
- What?
- James Cameron's directing "Aquaman"!

349
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,331
Fuck you.
Where'd you hear that? Friendster?

350
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,465
No, I heard it
from Josh Weinstein, you jerkoff.

351
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,874
Now get your hand off your dick
and go call somebody.

352
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,775
I don't care if he's
in the Arctic Shelf.

353
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,440
Get James Cameron on the phone!
Get Dana Gordon on the phone!

354
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,575
Tell her assistant
if she does not call me back,

355
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,949
I will fuck her worse
than I did in Cabo in '92.

356
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,784
- Do you really want me to say that?
- Improvise, Lloyd.

357
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,484
I'm gonna be there in 90 seconds.
Find out who covers Warner's.

358
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,117
If all this is not taken care of

359
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,492
I will choke you out
with a strap-on!

360
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,555
See you when you get here.
Potty-mouth.

361
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,762
James Cameron is not in.
Dana Gordon is not in.

362
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,533
- Mm-hmm.
- Peter Cole covers Warner.

363
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,233
- Who?
- Peter Cole.

364
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,572
- Where's Mr. Cole's fucking office?
- That way.

365
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,102
Call Gordon and Cameron every
five minutes until someone picks up!

366
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,082
Cole?! Where is Mr. Fucking
Peter Cole's office?

367
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,311
Cole? Where the fuck
is Peter Cole's office?

368
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,217
- Right there.
- Right here?

369
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,654
James Cameron
is directing "Aquaman"?

370
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,214
That's great.
That's awesome.

371
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,954
"That's awesome," huh?

372
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,963
You didn't think to bring
it up in the fucking staff meeting?

373
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,227
An e-mail?
A yellow fucking sticky something?

374
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,791
I didn't know I was supposed
to know that kind of stuff.

375
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,030
What is it you're supposed
to know, do you think?

376
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,504
What the fuck
do we pay you for?

377
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,097
To get your agency card laminated

378
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,734
so you can go to Shelter
and try to fuck Mischa Barton?

379
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,744
- I didn't think...
- Let me tell you something.

380
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,473
You don't have to say anything.
You know why?

381
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,811
'Cause you pick up
all your stuff

382
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,181
because you're
motherfucking fired!

383
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,025
- What happened?
- I don't know.

384
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,392
I was dropping off Peter's mail

385
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,522
and then Mr. Gold fired me.

386
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,556
My life is over.

387
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,766
I've got Dana Gordon
on the phone.

388
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,905
Is it true?

389
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,407
Ari, listen, I couldn't say anything,
okay? We were negotiating.

390
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,512
Did you tell Jimbo Vincent Chase
is attached to this project?

391
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,547
- It's all gonna be fine.
- Don't fuck me, Dana!

392
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,028
Who got you that job?
Who pulled you out of accounting?

393
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,257
Okay, Ari, listen to me,
all right?

394
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,164
I'm gonna tell you this,
but if you tell anyone that I told you

395
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,930
- I will deny it until my death.
- All right.

396
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,066
Alan and Jim are in Paris right now,
and as soon as they are done,

397
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,007
- they will take care of Vince.
- Uh-huh.

398
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,273
And, Ari, listen.
Alan loves Vince, okay?

399
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,406
His 14-year-old daughter has
Vince posters all over her walls.

400
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,178
We're all good.

401
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,511
Dana, I love you.

402
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,352
And if I wasn't married,
I'd take you back to Cabo with me.

403
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,950
Yeah, it wasn't Cabo, Ari.

404
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,359
It was a Red Roof Inn
in Rosarito.

405
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,260
It sure felt like Cabo
to me, Dana.

406
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,787
Goodbye!

407
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,891
Bye.

408
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,866
Hey, Lloyd, get in here.
I want to make out with you!

409
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,372
Coming.

410
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:55,255
Hey, Vince, you wanna tell these cunts
that I'm with you?

411
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,228
Is this guy with you, Vince?

412
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,890
This guy's gonna win Sundance
for the second time this year.

413
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,797
Billy Walsh.
You don't know him?

414
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,358
- Well, alrighty then, Mr. Walsh.
- Let him in.

415
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,870
Enjoy your evening.

416
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,450
Come on, guys.
Yo, Ari, the boys are here.

417
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,714
Hey, hey.
Is anybody on time anymore?

418
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,380
- What's up, baby?
- Whoo-hoo!

419
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,686
There he is, Mr. Walsh.
Congratulations, my friend.

420
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,021
Oh, great!
Another suit.

421
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,027
Suit Number One,
sit with Suit Number Two.

422
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,052
Great, he can direct us, huh?

423
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,796
Congratulations, Billy.

424
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,631
Hey, Skirt Suit,
move over would you?

425
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,399
- Let me get in next to the models.
- Asshole!

426
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,875
Billy, am I gonna be happy
with myself in the cut?

427
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,474
Happiness is a state
of mind, Johnny.

428
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,140
Now let me get your place.

429
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,946
I like your girl better, okay?
Move over. Come on.

430
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,385
You hear anything?

431
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,082
- It's all good.
- No, it's not all good.

432
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,683
Vince hired a decorator
today for a $150,000.

433
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,126
- Oh yeah, who'd you get?
- Carrie Carlson.

434
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,891
- She's good. She's expensive.
- What are you, an asshole?

435
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,695
No, I'm the guy that just got you
that James Cameron movie.

436
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,066
Do not fuck with me, Ari.

437
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,695
Just talked to the studio.

438
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,673
They're wrapping him up then
they're gonna wrap us up.

439
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:19,165
I wanted to wait to tell you so you
could grab the glory and tell your boy.

440
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,645
- You wanna hug it out? Come here.
- Yeah!

441
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:24,778
Vince, Cameron's in!

442
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,807
We're doing
a James Cameron movie!

443
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,787
Wow!
That's truly amazing!

444
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,846
Holy shit.
Yo, Johnny!

445
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,858
- Yo!
- I think it's retarded,

446
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,883
but if you want
to do your legs, you got it.

447
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,953
- What are you doing to your legs?
- Nothing.

448
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:42,660
Thanks, bro, but could we talk
about that later please.

449
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,636
I wanna say something!
Everybody grab a glass!

450
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,434
See this guy right here?

451
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,269
See that guy right there!

452
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,276
Nobody believed in them.

453
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,278
I did.
And it paid off.

454
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,041
And we believed
in you, Vince.

455
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,945
And that really
paid off, baby.

456
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,382
To Sundance and beyond!

457
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,249
Thank you!

458
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,251
Yo, Eric, if you guys
wanna move on down,

459
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,918
it seems a little crowded,
you can take over Leo's table.

460
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,587
- Why? He's not coming in?
- No no.

461
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,688
Leo went to Paris
to talk to James Cameron

462
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,392
about some fish movie.

463
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,669
We are so fucked.

464
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,733
We are so fucking fucked.
