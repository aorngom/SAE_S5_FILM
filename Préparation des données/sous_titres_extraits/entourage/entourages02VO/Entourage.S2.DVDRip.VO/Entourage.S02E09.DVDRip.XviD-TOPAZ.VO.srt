1
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:15,370
- Is it a beautiful day or what?
- That's a good one, Drama.

2
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,309
You aren't seriously gonna
wear that flag, are you?

3
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:21,575
When Pavarotti plays the El Rey
you can wear the Italian flag.

4
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,946
When my Irish brethren
come to town

5
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,042
I wear this.

6
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,180
Hey, Johnny, you know U2 was
the first concert you ever took me to.

7
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,452
"Joshua Tree" tour,
he snuck me out of a window.

8
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,152
- I was seven.
- Yeah, that's right.

9
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,161
- Excuse me.
- I got pulled over on the L.I.E.

10
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,924
I thought we were
gonna miss the show.

11
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,090
You were driving
when Vince was seven?

12
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,100
How fucking old
are you, Drama?

13
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,431
31. Get off my ass.

14
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,699
31, Drama?
Yeah, in dog years maybe.

15
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,205
Hey, guys, come on.
It's his birthday. Leave him alone.

16
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,141
- Give me a second with E.
- I hate it when you guys do that.

17
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,542
U2 rules!

18
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,780
I've been thinking
about this Mandy thing all night.

19
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,511
Forget it.
I want her to do the movie.

20
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,281
Now you want her to do it?
What happened at dinner last night?

21
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,516
Nothing. It was just weird
to see her, that's all.

22
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,353
- It's gonna be good though.
- You sure?

23
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,552
Yeah, I'm sure.
Don't even mention it to Ari.

24
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,392
- Okay.
- You already mentioned it to him.

25
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,830
I might have sent him
a panicked e-mail at 4:00 A.M.

26
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,731
I can't get Mandy Moore
off this movie.

27
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,565
How are the seats, Ari?
'Cause I need to be able to see Bono.

28
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,435
- You know what I mean?
- Ari, it's fine.

29
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,066
I was being an asshole yesterday.
I have no bad feelings for her.

30
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,632
In fact, I have no
feelings at all.

31
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,473
Excellent! Boom!
Let's make a movie.

32
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,480
Yeah, let's.

33
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,141
So how are those seats?

34
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,276
Uh, they're nosebleeds.
Just like you like them, right?

35
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,980
"Floor level or bust."
That's my motto.

36
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,784
I thought it was
"Will act for food."

37
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,951
Before this thing starts
let's get down to a little business.

38
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,292
Vinny, the studio wants
to see you in San Diego.

39
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,297
- What's in San Diego.
- Shamu.

40
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,561
- Comic-Con.
- Comic-Con?

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,228
Ain't that that comic book
geek-fest you go to every year?

42
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,830
That's no geek-fest.
That's my bread and butter.

43
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,636
I make $1800 a day
selling autties.

44
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,870
You sell German cars there?

45
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,108
Autographs, dickbag! I've been begging
you guys to come for years.

46
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,012
We've been laughing
in your face for years

47
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,914
because we don't like
comic book geeks.

48
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,114
You better start if you want to live
off "Aquaman" for the next 50 years.

49
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,748
The studio wants
to introduce "Aquaman" there.

50
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,281
They think these geeks
can make or break a movie

51
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,624
- a year before it opens.
- I don't really wanna go.

52
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,130
They don't pay you to act.
They pay you to promote.

53
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,927
Cameron would be there himself

54
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,434
if he wasn't overseeing
the construction of the water tank.

55
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,629
- He's not going?
- No. It's just you and Aquagirl.

56
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,400
You're gonna make
a big splash.

57
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,600
- Mandy's going?
- Yes!

58
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,375
What the hell?

59
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,209
We'll make a weekend
out of it.

60
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,442
I thought you had
no feelings for this girl.

61
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,109
I don't.
I'm going for Johnny.

62
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,278
- Sure you are.
- Comic-Con and U2!

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,788
That's a big birthday,
huh, Johnny Drama?

64
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,256
Not bad, Ari, not bad.
Now where are those seats?

65
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,156
Right here.
Take a look at that!

66
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,459
Very funny.

67
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,589
Clippers' tickets
for Thursday night.

68
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,499
- Stop fucking around, Ari.
- Are you serious?

69
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,162
You've got
to be shitting me!

70
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,262
You're kidding,
right?

71
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,637
Jesus Christ.
Ari Gold.

72
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,232
You just demoted to silver.

73
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,077
I will never forgive Ari
for this. Never.

74
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,980
Would you let it go
already, Drama?

75
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,009
I would've bought the tickets myself
if he hadn't promised them.

76
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,453
Drama, we could've gone.
You just refused to scalp.

77
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,457
We could've
had great seats for 200 a pop.

78
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:22,154
Scalping raises ticket prices so
the average fan can't afford them.

79
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,460
U2 stands up for the common man
and so do I.

80
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,159
You are the common man, Drama.

81
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,997
More like
an uncommon loser.

82
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,516
- Hey, Robbie.
- Welcome back, Mr. Chase.

83
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,579
- How are you, pal?
- Mr. Chase?

84
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,614
I'll handle this myself.

85
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,854
- As always.
- This place is horrifying.

86
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,556
- What are you talking about?
- There's my superhero!

87
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,259
Hey, Shauna.
You spinning a little story

88
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,700
how the Chase brothers are
conquering Comic-Con?

89
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,465
No, I'm gonna spin a story
that you really aren't Vince's brother.

90
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,996
Johnny!
Johnny Chase!

91
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,004
- How are you?
- Vanessa!

92
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,208
At Comic-Con, Shauna,
I think I'm Johnny's brother.

93
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,681
Yeah, how're you doing?

94
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,809
- How have you been?
- You look great.

95
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,478
- Are you here for the signing?
- Yeah!

96
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,283
Great.
What time are you at your booth?

97
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,018
Well, every year I do night signings
from 7:00 t09:00.

98
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,253
Oh, great.
I'm 6:00 to 8:00, so we'll overlap.

99
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,625
- I'll see you then. We'll catch up.
- Definitely.

100
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,324
- It's good to see you.
- All right, I'll see you later.

101
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,663
- Drama.
- That's a beautiful woman.

102
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,329
- Nice.
- I hate that bitch.

103
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,498
Vanessa Angel.
She did three eps of "Viking Quest"

104
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,065
and then they just gave her
this shitbag spin off.

105
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,771
She's been riding the "Viking Quest"
wave for a decade.

106
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,178
- So have you.
- Didn't "Angel Quest"

107
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,614
run five times longer
than "Viking Quest"?

108
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,448
Yeah, but only 'cause
she showed her tits in "Playboy."

109
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,114
Either way, Johnny,
I think the Angel likes you.

110
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,782
Yeah, she's beautiful too, Drama.

111
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,257
Well, not in my eyes
she's not.

112
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,886
Okay, Vincent,
back to real world issues.

113
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,624
You've got the R.J. Spencer
interview at 2:00 P.M.

114
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,531
He thinks he's Mike Wallace,
so he may throw you a hardball or two.

115
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,865
Yeah, Vince, just take
a deep breath and answer.

116
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,496
I might get some tough questions
this weekend also.

117
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,563
Like whether you're still
in the business?

118
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,370
Do you even know
who R.J. Spencer is?

119
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,572
Yeah, he's the guy that said the best
thing about "Head On" was my hair.

120
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,944
That's 'cause you wouldn't
talk to him in Paris.

121
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,347
The guy just wants access.
You be nice, he'll be nice.

122
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,818
I'm gonna tell him he's a fat
comic book-Ioving prick.

123
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,481
This guy's got a website that gets
a million hits a day.

124
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,683
He can sink a movie faster
than Stephen Dorff.

125
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,692
Hey, watch it, asshole!
That's my client!

126
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,388
Just look at the guy like a prom date.
You buy him a corsage,

127
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,989
- he'll at least give you a handjob.
- Who wants a handjob?

128
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,124
Would you shut up,
already, you and you?

129
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,897
- He'll be nice. Don't worry about that.
- Good.

130
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,303
Here's information on "Aquaman" in case
you don't know anything about it.

131
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,638
Oh, yeah, he's a strong
swimmer, right?

132
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:53,076
Vince, Mandy 3:00.

133
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,512
Bro, don't even
look at her.

134
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,278
- Just freeze her out.
- No, Vince, lock eyes with her.

135
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,877
- Don't break. Alpha male.
- Will you idiots shut up?

136
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,718
He's trying to make a movie with her,
not trying to bang her.

137
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,316
You looked!

138
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,621
I'll be right back.

139
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,321
Yo, eye of the tiger, Vin.

140
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,557
Hi!

141
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,963
- Hey. Hello.
- How are you?

142
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,299
Uh, Vince, this is my fiance Chris.

143
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,861
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

144
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,807
Yeah, you, as well.
This is pretty exciting stuff, huh?

145
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,469
I know, very exciting.

146
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,479
- It should be a big announcement.
- Mm-hmm.

147
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,209
Um, maybe we could
all grab a drink later?

148
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,342
- Sure.
- Yeah, maybe.

149
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,353
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

150
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,947
See you later.

151
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,422
Uh, Vince! Vince!

152
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,619
Would you like to come
to dinner with us?

153
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,060
- Us?
- Uh, Chris and I.

154
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,757
It would really mean a lot to me
if you guys got along.

155
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,527
I'm sorry, I just...

156
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,899
- I need you guys to get along.
- Yeah, of course.

157
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,369
- Okay?
- Sure. Bye.

158
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,235
- I'll see you later then.
- Okay.

159
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,297
Who the fuck cares
what she needs?

160
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,708
I've done at least a dozen movies
with women who couldn't stand me.

161
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,507
But it's never affected
the work.

162
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,947
They need to be friends if they're going
to spend the next nine months together.

163
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,213
Vince needs to make her
fall back in love with him

164
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,982
and then crush her like she crushed him.
Payback time!

165
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,489
No, what Vince needs to do
is never talk to her

166
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,048
except during work.

167
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,287
And even then,
only during takes.

168
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,229
Guys, you need to stop filling
his head with this shit.

169
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,391
What, do you think
I listen to them?

170
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,765
- What, you don't?
- Johnny Chase?

171
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,032
Hey, Jess,
how're you doin', baby?

172
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,333
Good.
How are you?

173
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,999
- Good.
- Good.

174
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,565
This is my brother Vince.
And these are the other guys.

175
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,134
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Jess.

176
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,770
Oh, it's nice
to meet you too.

177
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,111
These are my girls...
Devon and Teagan.

178
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,979
- Hey.
- How're you doin'?

179
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,985
So what brings you
to "Dork-a-palooza"?

180
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,884
Well, I'm doing
my "Viking Quest" thing

181
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,788
and Vince is here to promote "Aquaman."
What are you doing in town?

182
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,315
Promoting my new comic book,
"Pussy Patrol."

183
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,624
Nice.

184
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,788
It's me and the girls.

185
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,128
We lick ass by day
and kick ass by night.

186
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,258
- Sweet.
- You should come by the booth.

187
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,496
Yeah, as long as we
get there by nightfall.

188
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,368
Cool.
So I'll see you there?

189
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,532
- Yeah, definitely.
- Bye, Vince.

190
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,533
- Bye, girls.
- Bye-bye.

191
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,139
Whew!

192
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,045
How the fuck do you
know Jesse Jane?

193
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,983
You know how much Lubriderm I burned
through on that broad?

194
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,988
- Johnny, did you ever get with her?
- No, I wish.

195
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,081
Please tell me
you've never been in a porno.

196
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:21,025
No, we used to be in a scene study class
at Howard Fine Studio.

197
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,688
- She's got great timing.
- We're gonna go to this meeting.

198
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,527
- What're you guys gonna do?
- Every year I like to take a day

199
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,057
and soak in some sun.
It always freaks people out

200
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,228
at my booth
when Tarvold is tan.

201
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,966
It freaks me out
that people actually go to your booth.

202
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,876
All right, well, thanks for taking
the time to sit down with me, Vince.

203
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,539
Oh, no, R.J.,
my pleasure.

204
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,845
Hey, I felt awful
when I missed you in Paris.

205
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,908
Yeah, I thought you were
blowing me off.

206
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,319
Not at all. I tried the cell phone
you gave me 10 times.

207
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,414
You know how these
international phones are.

208
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,687
So, uh, Vince...

209
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,717
have you always been
a fan of "Aquaman"?

210
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,730
Oh, yeah.
Since I was a kid.

211
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,392
But I have to say
it really took hold for me

212
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,902
when Fradon started
doing the illustrations.

213
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,904
It think it took
a woman's point of view

214
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,202
to really capture
Aquaman's sensitivities.

215
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,140
Yes.

216
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,906
- He's good.
- The best.

217
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,007
Here, bro.

218
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,984
- Anyone looking at me?
- No.

219
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,920
Keep watching.
Someone will.

220
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,980
Tarvold?

221
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:28,221
- Tarvold?
- It's on.

222
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,194
- Yes?
- Can we get a picture with you?

223
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,288
My booth opens
at 6:00 P.M.

224
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,322
Autographs $10,
pictures $20.

225
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,562
I have a flight at 5:00.

226
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,365
Maybe next year, son.

227
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,201
I need my rest
before game time.

228
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,867
Come on. You're my favorite
"Viking Quest" character.

229
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:46,002
- I even bought my own helmet.
- Oh, yeah?

230
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,605
Let me see that thing.

231
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,843
Oh, she's a beaut.

232
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,714
No horns.

233
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,313
You know, it was only a myth
that Viking helmets had horns on them.

234
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,823
- One picture, please.
- 40 bucks for the exclusive.

235
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,258
- Done.
- Nah, I'll do it for nothing.

236
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,488
'Cause you guys
are real fans.

237
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,520
Can I get one Viking call?

238
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,532
Come on, we're in
civilian waters here.

239
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,261
Please.

240
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,098
All right,
I'll do one.

241
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,471
Victory!

242
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,343
Yes! Awesome!
Sweet, man!

243
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,969
Come on, let's get
this over with.

244
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,311
Hey, Johnny, you should put on sunblock.
You're getting a little red.

245
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,476
Thanks.

246
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,315
Is that the Angel?

247
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,652
Sorry, Tarvold.
Vanessa! Vanessa Angel!

248
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,749
Hey.

249
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:39,188
So tell me about your co-star
Mandy Moore.

250
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,200
Oh, she's great.
I'm very excited to work with her.

251
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,259
Again,
don't you mean?

252
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:47,966
Uh, yeah, I did a small part
in "A Walk to Remember."

253
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,942
Yeah. You guys were pretty serious
there for a while, right?

254
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,739
Serious?

255
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,905
- Oh, Jesus.
- Remain calm.

256
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,211
Dating-wise?

257
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,740
Well, we went out
a couple times.

258
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,549
I wouldn't call it serious.
But we're great friends now.

259
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,557
I mean, you did ask her
to marry you

260
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,185
after five weeks, so...

261
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,627
And she said no.

262
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,961
Okay, interview's over.

263
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,398
- Why?
- 'Cause you're an asshole, that's why.

264
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:16,901
Jesus Christ!
Vincent!

265
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,870
What the fuck
was that, R. J?

266
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,237
What, Shauna? I'm a journalist!
I'm asking questions!

267
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,038
That little comment
just cost you your opening weekend!

268
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,739
Aqua-fag!

269
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,839
- You asked her to marry you?
- Yeah, so what?

270
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:33,045
I'm your best friend since we were
six-years-old. I never heard this.

271
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,780
I'm like your
West Coast mother.

272
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,448
- I can't believe you didn't tell me.
- I never told anyone.

273
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,185
- I'm not anyone.
- What do you want to hear?

274
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,659
That I got humiliated?
That I curled up into a little ball

275
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,162
- like you usually do?
- Oh, hey, fuck you!

276
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:47,427
I don't have to take that shit from
some jerkoff just 'cause he has a PC!

277
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,559
Yes, you do!
That's why they pay you what they do!

278
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,332
That's why I didn't want this girl in
this movie, 'cause she'd fuck up

279
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,067
- your professional judgment!
- This wasn't professional,

280
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,007
- this was personal.
- This is not good.

281
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,205
- We've got to fix this.
- Get out your toolbox and fix it!

282
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,048
You should go out with the Angel,
I'm telling you!

283
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,883
Please, you know I don't like
classically beautiful women.

284
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,184
Give me a nice nose break
or a lazy eye.

285
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,951
You're insane.

286
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,755
Enough about the Angel. Here.

287
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,161
- Test me again.
- Come on, you're ruining my weekend.

288
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,325
Come on, these fans will tear me apart
if I don't know this shit.

289
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,801
Pass me the baby oil.

290
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,997
Maybe you should put on
a little sunblock.

291
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,973
- Test! Test!
- All right, fine.

292
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,905
Who is your mortal enemy?

293
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,507
Thorfinn Skullsplitter. Next.

294
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,576
What's the name
of Tarvold's ship?

295
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:44,180
The Gokstad!
Jesus, Turtle, challenge me a little.

296
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,622
Okay.

297
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,925
Where was Tarvold born?

298
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,192
Northumbria.

299
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,932
- It was Orkney.
- Bullshit!

300
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,267
- Let me see that thing.
- You forced me into doing this,

301
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,569
and now you're calling me a liar.
Fine, take it!

302
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,336
Okay, I believe you.

303
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,172
Orkney, huh?

304
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,508
Huh.

305
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:07,807
Orkney?

306
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,381
- Who is it?
- Hi, it's Eric Murphy.

307
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,786
- Vincent Chase's manager.
- It's too late.

308
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:20,485
My voice will be heard
around the world tomorrow morning.

309
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,188
Well, Vince would like
to apologize.

310
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,499
- I don't see Vince.
- Yeah, he sent me.

311
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,506
Well, that figures.
Fucking coward.

312
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,599
Hey, maybe that'll be
my headline...

313
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,406
- "Fucking Coward to Play Aquaman."
- You don't think

314
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,845
- Vince would make a good Aquaman?
- I did this morning.

315
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,714
You don't feel like you
have a responsibility to tell the truth?

316
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,241
Eric, I started this site
out of my parent's basement

317
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,880
for two reasons... to get laid
and make a little money.

318
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,117
Neither of which are
coming to fruition.

319
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,591
No, my report
goes out on the web

320
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,152
tomorrow morning,
and it's followed by another one

321
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,756
every week
until the movie opens.

322
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,232
I have one goal
in my life right now...

323
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,930
drown "Aquaman."

324
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:15,144
I'm not apologizing.
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

325
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,876
I'm telling you,
this guy's looking for a little love.

326
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,478
- It'll turn this whole thing around.
- So give him a little love.

327
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,215
I've got nothing,

328
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,416
except Shiry Robbins
can be here at 10:00.

329
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:29,086
- Who's she?
- "Maxim" girl. Great ass!

330
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,596
- 10:00 P.M.
- Vincent, we're in San Diego, okay?

331
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,064
Finding you a girl with a Q rating
isn't that easy.

332
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,090
- What is this?
- Mm.

333
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,935
Vince has got me working the phones
trying to find him a dinner date.

334
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,805
- I don't wanna go alone.
- Vincent, not for nothing,

335
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,901
but what I should be doing is dealing
with this Spencer situation

336
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,503
before the studio does.

337
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,912
I got an idea. I can call one
of my Cartier contacts

338
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,042
and see if I can get him
a watch or something.

339
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,416
- Why, can you buy this guy?
- Well, rumor has it

340
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,421
they flew him out
to L.A., first-class,

341
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,650
put him up for a week
at the Scientology Center,

342
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,659
and he gave "Swordfish"
four stars.

343
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:04,390
Yo, I've been searching all over
this place for a dinner date for you.

344
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,763
The concierge is kind of hot
but she's wearing Spock ears.

345
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,768
No, I can't go
with a Trekkie.

346
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,329
- Why can't you go to the dinner alone?
- Because I'm uncomfortable.

347
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,000
Because I haven't had
a real relationship since Mandy.

348
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,977
And I don't want to get into it while
she's holding hands with her fiance.

349
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,072
- Melting down.
- Yo, you guys, what do you think?

350
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,414
- Home or away?
- Oh my God!

351
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,649
- Jesus, look at your face.
- What are you talking about?

352
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,521
- It's perfectly even.
- Johnny, you're burnt to a crisp.

353
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:36,551
Naw, in another hour that'll turn
to a nice maple-syrupy brown.

354
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,359
Another hour and your fucking nose
is gonna fall off.

355
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,730
- Get dressed.
- Why?

356
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,599
I told you I don't wanna
go alone.

357
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,228
You want me to go
as your date?

358
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:50,332
All right, on second thought,
I'll go alone.

359
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,436
You just figure out what to do about
this Spencer guy.

360
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,019
Yo!

361
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,147
- What's up, Drama?
- How's it hanging?

362
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,350
- All right. Victory!
- Victory!

363
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,467
Yo, Bobby!

364
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,345
What's up, chief?
Another year, baby.

365
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,611
Hey, Johnny.

366
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,141
How great is this?
Our booths are never this close.

367
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,844
Now we can talk.

368
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,458
I'm gonna go look
for Spencer.

369
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,461
I'm gonna go with you.
Your fans, they spook me.

370
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,241
Ah, Mr. Chase,
welcome to the restaurant.

371
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,181
- I'm Craig your host.
- Hello, Craig. I'm here to meet with...

372
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,343
Of course. Ms. Mandy
and Mr. Chris, right?

373
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,216
- Yes.
- They are waiting for you.

374
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,084
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

375
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,807
Thanks for coming, buddy.

376
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,502
Next!

377
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,005
Where was Tarvold born?

378
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,980
How was the concert?

379
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,845
Uh, amazing.

380
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,647
Yeah, I hear it wasn't
their best.

381
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,654
I've been
to every tour.

382
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,588
They all kick ass, equally.

383
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,318
Great.

384
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:50,124
- Now where was Tarvold born?
- That's easy, Orkney.

385
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,858
No, it's Northumbria.

386
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,627
Fucking Turtle.

387
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:03,173
I was originally from
the galaxy of Salvan,

388
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,176
but that was before
my rebirth.

389
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,339
How could you not know
where you were born?

390
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,655
Angel, excuse me, uh...

391
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,783
I'd like to have
a word with you, please.

392
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,954
- Could it wait like half an hour?
- No, it can't.

393
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,464
Okay, Johnny.
I'll be back in five minutes.

394
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,930
I told you
to put on block.

395
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,199
Forget about my tan.

396
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,365
What you're doing here
is disgusting.

397
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,307
- What?
- You're selling sex.

398
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,742
- I mean, look at this outfit.
- Why do you hate me?

399
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,769
I don't... hate you.

400
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,976
You always have. Ever since
that first day on "Viking Quest"

401
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,178
- you've been so mean to me.
- No, I...

402
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,017
And I had
the biggest crush on you.

403
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:53,252
- You did?
- Yes!

404
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,453
Oh my God.
I had the biggest crush on you.

405
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,791
That's why
I was mean to you.

406
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,592
I was rejecting you
before you could reject me.

407
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,065
I wish you would've
told me back then.

408
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,968
- Well, I'm telling you now.
- But...

409
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,131
Shh!

410
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,418
Victory!

411
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,420
Victory!

412
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,292
So you started with
the comic book then the porn?

413
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,264
No, I did in porn, then I decided
to go on with the comic book.

414
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,357
Oh, smart move,
very smart.

415
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,460
So tell me more about
"Pussy Patrol."

416
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:42,405
Well, we're a gang-banging gang
of working girls who kick criminal ass.

417
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,841
Speaking of kicking their ass...

418
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,310
what do you do
with the naughty boys?

419
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,782
You know, naughty boys
that do naughty things?

420
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:51,942
What up, Jesse?

421
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,748
Hey, it's Vince's guys.
You know R.J.

422
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,686
Yeah,
we know each other.

423
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,520
If you don't mind when you're finished
if I can get a minute.

424
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,392
- Your minute starts right now.
- All right, I really want to fix this.

425
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,261
I was thinking... we go into production
you should come out.

426
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,631
All expenses paid, watch Cameron work,
hang out on the set.

427
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,660
You want a PlayStation portable,
I got the hook up.

428
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,899
I can get you
two dozen of them.

429
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,637
I want $350,000
in a duffel bag.

430
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:22,078
- You're kidding me, right?
- No, I'm not kidding.

431
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,639
And until that gets delivered,
the article stands.

432
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,151
And you know why?
'Cause I don't like your friend.

433
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,982
You're really starting
to piss me off.

434
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,114
Oh, wow. Ooh.

435
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:34,489
What are you gonna do? I had Oliver
Stone come after me with a hatchet

436
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,017
after I smashed
"Alexander," okay?

437
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,087
- You don't scare me.
- Yeah? Do I scare you?

438
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,894
'Cause I'll slap you
in your fucking head.

439
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,162
Come on, let me hit him once.
I won't break nothing.

440
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,726
- Let it go, Turtle.
- What the fuck is his problem?

441
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,103
He hates Vince.
He's gonna trash him on his web site.

442
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,040
And say he's gonna make
a shitty Aquaman.

443
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,305
Why? Vince would make
an adorable Aquaman.

444
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,312
Yeah, you should
tell him that.

445
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,314
Yeah, sweetie, you should.

446
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,679
Aquaman's in trouble.

447
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:01,345
The fate of Atlantis
and all of mankind lies in your hands.

448
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,752
It's time to unleash
the power of the pussy.

449
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,381
Don't bullshit me,
tough guy.

450
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,858
If I do it, I'll do it
because I like Vince.

451
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,485
Yo!

452
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,759
I just made $3800, bro.

453
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,629
Are you gonna see her again?

454
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,193
Are you kidding? We're flying together
at Comic-Con Phoenix.

455
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,067
What happened at dinner?

456
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,373
- I blew it off.
- Good job, Vince.

457
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,240
Freeze her out,
like I told you to do.

458
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,008
Aw, Vince, you should've gone
and ordered her food for her.

459
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,538
That would've put a wedge
in between her and her fiance.

460
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,210
What do you mean
you blew it off?

461
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,811
We just have to work together.
No need to blur the lines.

462
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,880
More importantly, what happened
with Spencer. Did you take care of that?

463
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:42,087
- Did you give him love?
- It's not my love he's interested in.

464
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,197
Who is it?

465
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,467
Pussy Patrol. Open up!

466
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,444
Hey, Jesse, I, uh...

467
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,504
I thought we were gonna to finish
the interview down in the Oak Bar.

468
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,912
We're done talking.

469
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:07,180
- We're here to save "Aquaman."
- And we brought this.

470
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,025
Come in.

471
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,579
That's wonderful.

472
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,812
Okay, great!

473
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,377
That was R.J., Eric.
What did you do to him?

474
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,549
- Why, what did he say?
- He said, and I quote,

475
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,218
"Vince is going to make the best
fucking Aquaman ever!"

476
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,728
That was the quickest 180
I've ever seen in my life.

477
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,787
Let's just say
we have mutual friends.

478
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,129
The power
of the pussy, baby.

479
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,795
You kiss your grandmother
with those fucking lips?

480
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,464
- I thought you said 10:30.
- Vince, come on!

481
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,837
I know you well enough
to know when you're lying.

482
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,865
There was no reason
not to show up.

483
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,538
All right, let's just say hypothetically
I am lying,

484
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,173
which I'm not... but if I was,
you need me to be friends

485
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,809
with your fiance, and I need
not be friends with him.

486
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,512
- Why?
- Because.

487
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,282
We're not playing
games anymore.

488
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,687
Is this going to be a problem
for us to work together?

489
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,623
No. I'm just gonna do
my work every day.

490
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,183
- Fine, so am I.
- Fine. Good.

491
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,286
Live from the Hollywood Room
at Comic-Con...

492
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,024
- Okay.
- Good.

493
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,964
...here are the stars
of the upcoming "Aquaman,"

494
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:31,025
Vincent Chase and Mandy Moore!

495
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,246
I hope there's a part
in this movie for me.

496
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,878
Oh, yeah.
You're gonna play Aqua Velva.

497
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,124
Hey, say something!

498
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,653
We look forward
to fighting injustice,

499
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,758
righting that which is wrong
and serving all of mankind.

500
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,099
Above and below
sea level!

501
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,931
Give them a big hand,
ladies and gentlemen.

502
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,306
- He's good.
- No, he's great.

503
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,615
Hey, what's up, Ari?

504
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:25,179
Just read R.J. Spencer on-line.
Good work, Eric.

505
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,521
- Put Drama on the phone.
- Hold on.

506
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,091
- It's Ari.
- Ari?

507
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,359
- For me?
- Yeah.

508
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,628
- Fuck that.
- Take it!

509
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,604
Yeah, what do you want,
birthday-ruiner?

510
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,836
It's 4:00. You've got four hours
to get back from San Diego.

511
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,365
- For what?
- U2, baby!

512
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,435
You didn't hear?
They just added an extra show.

513
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:51,438
- You got tickets?
- Oh, I got tickets. Happy belated.

514
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,178
How are the seats?

515
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,311
Nose bleeds.
Just like you like them.

516
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,514
Yes!

517
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,114
All right, now.

518
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,909
Hey, Johnny Drama!

519
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,751
¿ Qué tal?

520
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,795
Feliz cumpleaños, amigo.
