Transcript & synchro:
Jesslataree/Kasius/Sixe

3
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:22,452
That's what I call
a service with a smile.

4
00:01:22,727 --> 00:01:25,183
More like a smile I'd like to service.

5
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:27,736
She's pretty cute, E.
The whole time she smiled at you,

6
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:28,902
you should get her number.

7
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,525
I don't wanna go out with a waitress.

8
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:32,544
You believe this guy?
A few years out of Queens,

9
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:34,372
and he thinks
he's above the working class.

10
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,562
My mother used to wait tables.
I respect them.

11
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:39,637
I just don't want a relationship with
one of them, They keep shitty hours.

12
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:41,887
Who said anything about a relationship?

13
00:01:42,323 --> 00:01:46,272
Why do you have to look at everygirl
as a potential relationship?

14
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,111
'Cause I don't wanna spend
my twilight years alone, like you.

15
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:50,875
E loves falling in love.

16
00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:52,858
E's a nesting creature,
what's the big deal?

17
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,194
'Cause it's not natural for a male,
is the big deal.

18
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:58,099
I'm not a nesting creature.

19
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:00,464
Really?

20
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,726
Name one girl
you've ever had unemotional sex with.

21
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:06,223
Ever.

22
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:10,340
Lori Wolcott.

23
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,604
You sent her flowers and chocolates
and refused to leave your house

24
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:15,957
- 'cause she wouldn't be your Valentine.
- I didn't leave

25
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:18,543
- 'cause I had chicken pox, you loser.
- Wolcott don't count.

26
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:21,161
All right. What about
the perfect 10 model from Australia?

27
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:23,883
If I'm not mistaken,
you didn't fuck her. She fucked you.

28
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:25,999
Not to mention
you called her 2 months after

29
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:28,532
and the only reason's
'cause you couldn't get a citizenship.

30
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:30,474
I don't have to prove anything
to you guys.

31
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:32,401
Don't be mad. It's not our fault.

32
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:34,808
You were born
without the sport fucking gene.

33
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,792
Come on, guys. I can't just stand here
and let you harass my boy.

34
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:40,090
I know he can have unemotional sex.

35
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:41,738
He just chooses not to.
In fact,

36
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,322
I bet he can get some
before the both of you two.

37
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:47,329
Please, I'm a celebrity again, bro.

38
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:48,900
I could get laid at a funeral.

39
00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:51,540
And that would be unemotional
for you or the dead girl?

40
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:52,868
Funny, E.

41
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,168
Be a student of human nature,
no leopard can change its spots.

42
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,009
I've come to accept you
for what you are.

43
00:02:58,131 --> 00:02:59,301
- What's that?
- A pussy.

44
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:00,697
You're such a pussy in fact,

45
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,616
I bet Turtle can close a broad quicker.

46
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:06,544
That's it. You're saying Turtle
can get laid quicker than I can?

47
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:09,737
No, I think he can bring himself
to do it quicker than you can.

48
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:11,489
I'm so positive in fact,

49
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:14,356
I'm willing to wage you
5 of my hard-earned G's

50
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:17,148
that Turtle can close a girl
today before you.

51
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,503
Johnny, are you serious?

52
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:21,963
These eyes look like I'm bluffing, bro?

53
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,075
You're on.
Come on. I'm taking E. under my wing.

54
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:26,255
Then I'm taking Turtle under mine.

55
00:03:26,408 --> 00:03:27,913
I ain't betting on this.

56
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:30,124
And I'm not searching out a girl
just to fuck her.

57
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:31,568
- Why not?
- 'Cause it's mean.

58
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:37,861
Mean is when I made Jess Mancini ride
her bike home after I ass fucked her.

59
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:42,290
Trust me, if you're able to find a girl
who's willing to day fuck you,

60
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:44,476
she's using you
as much as you're using her.

61
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,508
It's 2007, wake up, pussy.

62
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,323
Oh, he's up. And he's in.

63
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:50,794
- Whatever.
- So what are the rules?

64
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:52,903
It's gotta be a complete stranger,

65
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:55,291
- and E can't call her after.
- It's gotta be free,

66
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:56,628
he can't pay or bought her.

67
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,547
- Jesus.
- Sorry, Turtle.

68
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:00,777
On the good chase name, man.

69
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:02,485
On the good chase name.
Come on, E.

70
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:03,926
Let's go win us a ribbon.

71
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:06,563
Catch you guys later.

72
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:08,812
How am I supposed to get laid
by tonight?

73
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:11,575
Relax, Turtle. Old Johnny boy's
gonna take you to a place

74
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:13,535
where even an one-eye leper
can get laid.

75
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:14,657
Where is that?

76
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:15,845
Craig's List.

77
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:21,949
Good to see you.
All right, high five.

78
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,742
All right, so I'm gonna pick you up
after soccer practice,

79
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,114
call me, I brought my cellphone
if you're running late.

80
00:04:27,236 --> 00:04:29,779
- Great, thank you. Bye, Daddy.
- Later, traitor.

81
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:30,913
- Ari.
- Daddy.

82
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:32,937
- I'm kidding, I love you.
- I know you do.

83
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:34,712
I could so jump this curb right now.

84
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,935
Well, Ari, you may hate this place,
but our daughter still has to go there.

85
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,813
Mr. Preston!

86
00:04:43,164 --> 00:04:45,062
Oh, Mr., Mrs. Gold! How are you?

87
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,580
Well, not so good.

88
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:49,517
Our son got rejected
from every private school in town.

89
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,080
I'm sorry to hear that.

90
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:55,026
They didn't happen
to call you about us, did they?

91
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:56,847
We all stay in touch.

92
00:04:57,003 --> 00:04:59,451
I'm asked questions
and I answer them honestly.

93
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:00,758
'Course you do.

94
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:02,920
All right,
we're up to see another public school.

95
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:04,171
It's not so bad, you know.

96
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:06,113
I'm a product
of the public school system.

97
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:07,235
Me too.

98
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:09,664
So far I just blackboned
a little cunt, fag, bitch...

99
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:13,185
- A nice day to both of you.
- ... mother fucker, asshole, fuck me...

100
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,306
Same spot as usual?

101
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:25,030
- That'd be good. Thanks.
- Awesome.

102
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,531
So, what do you think?

103
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:28,806
I think this is retarded.
I really do.

104
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,663
I mean, who hits on girls on week days?

105
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:32,497
E, it's L.A.
Every day's a week-end.

106
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:34,326
Now just relax, look around.

107
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:36,317
And let the game come to you.

108
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,084
Those girls over there
would like to buy you guys a drink.

109
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:43,262
Or to me,
and then to you through me.

110
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,023
- Thank you. That'd be great.
- All right.

111
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:52,724
Horny heifer seeks back door lover.

112
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:54,907
- Pass!
- What do you mean, pass?

113
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,434
This isn't about having fun.

114
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,921
- It's about winning the cash.
- How much am I getting?

115
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:01,627
- For her, 20%.
- Pass.

116
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:05,310
How about a chick
with a plus-size clit for 30?

117
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:07,182
It's pass.

118
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:08,696
What the--

119
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,107
Slide over, let me scroll.

120
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:16,137
See, this is a little more my speed.

121
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:20,312
Prom Queen hottie seek
short, cute and cuddly 20-something

122
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:21,737
to fulfill her fantasies.

123
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:22,958
Sounds perfect.

124
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:25,082
Yes, too perfect. She must be a pig.

125
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:28,097
Call her or I'm calling the heifer.

126
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:35,039
Put it on speaker.

127
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:38,573
Is this Kelsey?

128
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,155
<i>Yes, who is this?</i>

129
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:41,684
I'm calling about your ad.

130
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:42,917
<i>What about it?</i>

131
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,449
I think I can fulfill your needs.

132
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,535
- <i>What do you look like?</i>
- What do <i>you</i> look like?

133
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:50,143
Time is of the essence, Turtle.

134
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:51,479
<i>How many of you are there?</i>

135
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:53,509
Just me.

136
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:55,943
<i>'Cause, you know,
I'm not looking for gang bang.</i>

137
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:59,747
It's just me,
one short cuddly twenty something.

138
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:01,143
Just what you said you wanted.

139
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:03,891
<i>Be at Café Primo on Sunset and 30.</i>

140
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:06,401
<i>Wear a red hat. If I like what I see,</i>

141
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:08,363
- <i>I'll say hi.</i>
- And if you don't?

142
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:09,809
Then I won't.

143
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,561
- This is a nightmare.
- No, it's perfect.

144
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:16,844
And if you close her on the parking lot,
the lattes are on me. Come on!

145
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:33,215
You gotta be kidding me.

146
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:35,829
It's play to them,
this is what kids do when they play.

147
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:38,743
This is what inmates do
when they're gonna overtake the guards.

148
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:43,149
I mean, is there even a teacher here
or did they lose him the cutbacks?

149
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:44,281
I know karate.

150
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:46,533
I saw you kicking
that little redhead boy over there

151
00:07:46,656 --> 00:07:48,533
when he wasn't looking.
That was a very--

152
00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:55,370
No way is my son going to that school.
No way!

153
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:57,687
Well, Ari, we don't have much choice.

154
00:07:57,969 --> 00:07:59,288
So stop being so dramatic.

155
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,998
Dramatic? Why should I be dramatic?

156
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,427
It's every father's dream to have a son
participate in a kindergarten fatwa.

157
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:07,560
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking care of business

158
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:10,039
the way I should've taken
care of business from the start.

159
00:08:10,465 --> 00:08:13,373
Call our special friend
and set the usual meeting place.

160
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:14,858
- Who is it?
- Don't worry,

161
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,248
I'm not gonna get a...

162
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,267
You girls are from London

163
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:21,722
and that happens to be
E's favorite city.

164
00:08:21,844 --> 00:08:22,844
Really?

165
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:25,260
I mean, it just beat out Düsseldorf.

166
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:28,112
I love Dusseldorf.
Where do you stay when you're there?

167
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,471
I'm only kidding,
I've never been to Düsseldorf.

168
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:34,448
- But you've been to London?
- Several times,

169
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,352
we stay at the Maria. It's pretty cool.

170
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:39,867
So...

171
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:41,508
What are you doing here?

172
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,873
We're here on business.

173
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:45,131
- What kind of business are you?
- I design linens.

174
00:08:45,253 --> 00:08:46,664
And I'm her top salesrate.

175
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:47,911
Nice.

176
00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:50,721
They're incredibly soft, the linen.

177
00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:53,611
I could show them to you,

178
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,961
perhaps if you like them,
you could spread the word.

179
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,361
You know, it never hurts
to have a celebrity endorser.

180
00:08:58,628 --> 00:09:01,382
I could never endorse a product
that I didn't actually use.

181
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,454
You would use these, I'm sure.

182
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:05,431
Come, I'll show you a sample.

183
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:09,185
- You okay?
- That's fine.

184
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:11,099
Heather runs my entire company.

185
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:13,833
She can certainly look
after one shy American boy.

186
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:15,347
- Shy!
- Ta-ta.

187
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:17,507
I'm not shy.

188
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:18,758
No?

189
00:09:19,453 --> 00:09:20,803
How would you describe yourself?

190
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:22,385
Maybe a little shy.

191
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:25,144
That's okay.

192
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:26,456
It's adorable.

193
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:31,121
Excuse me.

194
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:33,177
You wouldn't happen to be Kelsie?

195
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:34,863
Even if I was, I'd say no.

196
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:37,593
That's just rude, honey.

197
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:40,888
That ain't her.

198
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:42,586
Who the hell is she?

199
00:09:42,771 --> 00:09:45,460
You could have railed the heifer
and the plus-sized clit by now.

200
00:09:45,924 --> 00:09:47,042
You Turtle ?

201
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,068
I'm Kelsie.

202
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:51,910
Who's he?

203
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:54,457
He's my driver.

204
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:55,950
Could he wait in the car.

205
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:58,383
The way he's staring at me,
it's giving me the willies.

206
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,706
Run along.

207
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:04,118
So... what we do now?

208
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,762
Well, I like what I see.

209
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:08,053
Really?

210
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:12,314
Got good padding. You do just fine.

211
00:10:13,722 --> 00:10:16,400
So... what kind of fantasies
are we gonna be fulfilling?

212
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,673
You'll find out later.

213
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:19,757
First, go to Fazio Cleaners on Rexford.

214
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,934
Pick that up for me.

215
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,068
You want me
to pick up your dry cleaning?

216
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,373
- Is that a problem?
- No.

217
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,794
If we're really gonna be living out
some kind of fantasy

218
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:28,859
it won't be a problem
to clean your whole house.

219
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,424
Don't be desperate, it's gross.

220
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:32,736
Here's my adress.

221
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:36,646
Be there at 9 p.m.

222
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:38,884
And don't be late, I hate tardiness.

223
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:51,816
You know, Ari...

224
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:54,617
We meet so often,
that if another PI was following me,

225
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:56,069
he'd think we were fucking.

226
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,143
If another PI was following you,
then I would be fucked.

227
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:01,362
So what can I do for you today?

228
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:03,615
I need one of your 24/7 tails.

229
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,785
This one has to be on the extreme,
extreme D.L.

230
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,781
So you mean more extreme than
when you had me follow Kate Beckinsale

231
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:11,531
to see if she was gonna fire her agent?

232
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:13,556
More extreme, and more discrete.

233
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:17,165
If anyone finds out about this,
it could be very, very embarrassing.

234
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:18,747
All right.

235
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:21,042
Who's the subject?

236
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:22,812
Andrew Preston.

237
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:26,884
He is the head administrator
of the Briar Country Day school.

238
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:34,978
Do you think it was rude of us
living them alone like that?

239
00:11:35,384 --> 00:11:37,452
Are you kidding?
The way they were hitting it off,

240
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,063
it would've been rude of us to stay.

241
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,309
Good point.

242
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:45,919
So, you guys have a suite?

243
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:50,026
Yeah, it sucks. Juliette and I have
to share a tiny little bed together.

244
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:51,203
Really?

245
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,936
Does that turn you on?

246
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,691
I was just--

247
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:56,525
We are here on business, Eric,

248
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:58,595
the company pay for my own room
and everything.

249
00:11:58,743 --> 00:12:01,416
I wasn't saying that,
I was just asking, I'm sorry.

250
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:03,827
No, I'm just playing,
there's no need to apologise.

251
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:05,114
I'm sorry.

252
00:12:08,956 --> 00:12:10,229
Do I make you nervous?

253
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:12,544
So you are just nervous usually.

254
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:14,423
- Do I seem nervous to you?
- You do.

255
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:16,924
I have a very stressful job.
I actually need another drink,

256
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:18,902
I haven't seen the waitress around
forever.

257
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:21,314
- Do you need anything?
- Yeah. You want another drink?

258
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:24,295
- Four shots of Tequila.
- With limes.

259
00:12:24,497 --> 00:12:25,789
- Of course.
- Laugh at me,

260
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:28,121
I may use limes,
but I will drink you under the table.

261
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:29,625
Now we're getting somewhere.

262
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:32,037
Holy shit.

263
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,448
Oh, Jesus.

264
00:12:34,891 --> 00:12:36,936
Oh, my God. Let me call you back.

265
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:38,538
I'll be right back.

266
00:12:44,443 --> 00:12:47,260
- You are back.
- Yeah, for a few weeks.

267
00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:49,312
- I didn't know.
- Well,

268
00:12:49,497 --> 00:12:52,090
I figured I shouldn't call you,
you told me not to call, so...

269
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:57,436
- I'm sorry, hi.
- Hi.

270
00:12:57,725 --> 00:13:00,164
You know what? That's my bad.
Sloan, this is Juliette.

271
00:13:00,349 --> 00:13:02,239
- Heather.
- Really.

272
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:06,869
Juliette is Heather's friend
and she's with Vince somewhere.

273
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,968
- Right, nice to meet you.
- Me too.

274
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,796
I should get going.
Good to see you, Eric.

275
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:18,334
I'll see you soon, right?
Okay.

276
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:22,520
- Bye.
- See you.

277
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,799
Your ex?

278
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:27,882
Is it that obvious?

279
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,503
She's pretty.

280
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,471
Why did you guys break up?

281
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:33,554
'Cause I'm an idiot.

282
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,968
What kind of fantasy involves me
picking up her dry cleaning?

283
00:13:41,463 --> 00:13:43,352
Maybe she wants me
to be her little errand boy.

284
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:45,399
I don't know,
but I bet she'll be disappointed

285
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,447
when she finds out
you're already Vince's.

286
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:48,892
Maybe she's into S&M.

287
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:51,222
Maybe she's even a dominatrix.

288
00:13:52,141 --> 00:13:53,344
You better hope not, Turtle.

289
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:55,603
Because dominatrix don't fuck.

290
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:58,451
If you don't get laid,
I don't get paid.

291
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,851
Drama, don't you worry.

292
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:01,521
Unless she wants to shit on me,

293
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:04,546
there's no fetish that'll keep me
from getting with that little hottie.

294
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:05,968
That's the spirit.

295
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:09,500
- What the fuck is this?
- Yes, I love it.

296
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,800
My bet is safe.

297
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:12,800
Oh this means something to you?

298
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,067
Oh yeah.

299
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:15,800
It means you got a furry, bro.

300
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,800
What the fuck's a furry?

301
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,600
Someone who wants to fuck you
like you're a stuffed animal.

302
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:26,300
Jesus, baby, what's wrong?

303
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:29,472
You sound worse than when Harry Hamlin
got voted off <i>Dancing with the stars</i>.

304
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:31,406
Audra Hornig's son
just got accepted to Briar.

305
00:14:31,501 --> 00:14:33,336
Is that the kid
that already has chest hairs?

306
00:14:33,536 --> 00:14:34,636
He's your son's best friend.

307
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:37,794
He'll be devastated when he finds out
they're not going to school together.

308
00:14:37,817 --> 00:14:39,800
Don't worry. They'll be
going to school together.

309
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:42,574
- Your man is handling it.
- My man is gonna be handling himself

310
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:45,000
for the next decade if he doesn't stop
playing it so cool

311
00:14:45,156 --> 00:14:46,467
<i>and tell me what he's up to.</i>

312
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:48,439
This is like <i>The Godfather</i>, baby.

313
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:51,089
There're certain times you just
can't ask me about my business.

314
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,511
- <i>But please, don't worry.</i>
- Don't tell me not to worry.

315
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:55,067
Our special friend is on the phone.

316
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,133
I gotta go. It's all good, baby.

317
00:14:57,311 --> 00:14:59,105
Ari, you are such a fucker!

318
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Talk to me, Eddie.

319
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:06,200
- <i>Can you come to my office?</i>
- On my way.

320
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:12,100
- Good news?
- Don't ask questions, Lloyd,

321
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:14,600
not until you stop
dressing like Paula Poundstone.

322
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,200
Who is Paula Poundstone?

323
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,906
Yeah well, you know nothing gets a girl

324
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:24,061
hot like listening to a guy
mope about his ex.

325
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:25,349
Hey, she was a good listener.

326
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:26,700
So what do we tell the boys?

327
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:28,800
Tell'em if not for unforeseen events,
I had her.

328
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:31,178
- It was a done deal.
- I don't think that counts as a win.

329
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,769
- Whatever, it would have been.
- So you're not gonna call her?

330
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:34,969
Who, sloan or Heather?

331
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:36,653
- Why Sloan?
- I don't know, to talk.

332
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:39,194
It seemed she wanted to.
We leave things a little unfinished.

333
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,453
When you broke up with her,
I think it was finished.

334
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:43,488
- She broke up with me.
- But you made her.

335
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,266
You're feeling bad about it now?

336
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:46,783
I've been feeling bad for months.

337
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,100
E, what has this day been all about?

338
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:51,521
I don't know.
You tell me.

339
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:53,706
Your inability to be unemotional.

340
00:15:54,157 --> 00:15:56,200
You just ran into Sloan
and you're feeling things.

341
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:58,072
Maybe real, maybe not.

342
00:15:58,161 --> 00:15:59,700
You really want to win this bet, huh?

343
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:01,472
No, look, forget about the bet.

344
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:03,800
What you need is a night
to think about what you want.

345
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:06,200
So sleep on it.
Or sleep on Heather.

346
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,272
- Your choice.
- She was hot.

347
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:10,875
There you go.
See, why don't I call Juliette

348
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,145
and the four of us will go out
and have a good time?

349
00:16:13,183 --> 00:16:15,191
You're gonna call a girl
after you've fucked her?

350
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:16,318
Look, I liked her.

351
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:17,656
And I'm not in on the bet.

352
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,203
I feel like a moron.
This thing doesn't even fit!

353
00:16:21,403 --> 00:16:23,248
I'm supposed to put my dick
through this hole?

354
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:25,286
- What if it gets stuck?
- What, is it easter?

355
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,150
Maybe we weren't clear on the rules,

356
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,600
but role-playing and fucking each other
doesn't count.

357
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:33,900
Please, my man here is getting ready
to fuck a real live woman.

358
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:35,400
Win me five G's.

359
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,933
Unless by some miracle,
E already got laid.

360
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,600
Please tell me you got laid, E.

361
00:16:40,722 --> 00:16:42,800
- It's in the works.
- Jesus!

362
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:45,171
Quit your whining,
and consider yourself lucky.

363
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,500
A girl like that is a goddess
in the furry community.

364
00:16:47,744 --> 00:16:48,878
You're gonna fuck in that?

365
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,600
Actually, furr-ophiles
refer to it as "boinking."

366
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:55,483
Wow, Turtle,
this is freaky even for me.

367
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:58,565
Don't let 'em get in your head.
Furries are people, too.

368
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,700
And all people need to get laid.

369
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,900
Except that whack job,

370
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:05,930
who only needs a good book,
a cup of tea and a nice long hug.

371
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,400
You're helping Bugs Bunny
string his dick through a hole

372
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:09,678
and I'm a whack job?

373
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,472
Why don't you just tell us
what you have in the works

374
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:15,583
that's gonna win this bet before my
"plushious" little friend here.

375
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,700
E's got a hot British chick
just waiting for him to call.

376
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:22,200
British? Please.
They're too stuffy to fuck that fast.

377
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:23,500
Well her friend wasn't.

378
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,833
- You got laid, vin?
- Yeah, I had a nice afternoon.

379
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,500
So how come E couldn't close, then?

380
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,158
He hit a little road bump,
but he's coming back from it.

381
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,600
Actually, no I'm not.

382
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:34,324
- You're gonna call Sloan?
- Yep.

383
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:36,353
He can't fuck Sloan.
That's against the rules.

384
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:38,662
No, he ran into her
when he was talking to the brit.

385
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,856
The kid's got some shit luck.

386
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:42,750
- So this  means the bet's off.
- Off?

387
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:45,500
It's a forfeit,
and a forfeit results in a loss,

388
00:17:45,683 --> 00:17:47,839
and a loss
is gonna cost you five G's, bro.

389
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:49,078
All right, Johnny.

390
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:52,100
I couldn't possibly let Turtle
go through with it anyway.

391
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,561
Love you, Vin.

392
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,600
You do realize
you forfeit your cut too, Turtle.

393
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,922
How are you?

394
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:10,155
- Hi.
- <i>Hi.</i>

395
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:15,664
Look, I just wanted to explain...

396
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:17,442
that today at the pool,

397
00:18:17,753 --> 00:18:19,951
I just met that girl.
I don't even know her.

398
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:24,173
We're not together anymore
so you don't owe me any explanations.

399
00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:26,284
I know, I know.
I was just...

400
00:18:27,195 --> 00:18:28,284
I was just thinking.

401
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:29,929
About what?

402
00:18:31,356 --> 00:18:32,378
About us.

403
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:36,467
I told you there would be no more us
if you went to Italy for three months

404
00:18:36,645 --> 00:18:38,423
after being away on the movie for six.

405
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:39,578
<i>I know, I screwed up.</i>

406
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:42,200
But we could go to dinner
or something, talk about it?

407
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:47,579
I met someone.

408
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:51,312
Really?

409
00:18:56,322 --> 00:18:58,589
There he is!
The baddest dick Johnny Wad.

410
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,767
I want to introduce you to one of our
associates. This is Frank Giovanella.

411
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:06,600
What do I got here. Two dicks
for the price of one. I love it.

412
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:07,921
Listen. As it turns out,

413
00:19:08,088 --> 00:19:10,266
FranK over here
was hired by another unhappy couple

414
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:12,355
to dig up the dirt
on your headmaster Preston.

415
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,332
and he's been tailing him
for a couple weeks.

416
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,421
Wonderful. Maybe
we can split the bill, huh?

417
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,632
What do you got?

418
00:19:17,877 --> 00:19:19,432
Unfortunately, sir, I've got nothing.

419
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:22,032
- What do you mean?
- The guy's clean.

420
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,143
There's no such thing.
Everyone’s got something.

421
00:19:24,321 --> 00:19:25,788
Well, apparently, not this guy.

422
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:27,354
The guy's a model human.

423
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:28,754
Look for yourself.

424
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:30,821
That's him coaching soccer.

425
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:32,754
Volunteering in a soup kitchen.

426
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:34,710
Making dinner for his family.

427
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:36,799
- Jesus...
- Yeah.

428
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,399
He still screws his wife.
She's hot, too.

429
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:41,065
I gotta tell you,

430
00:19:41,276 --> 00:19:42,743
in all my years in this business,

431
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:44,454
we've never failed to find the dirt.

432
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:45,810
I'm sorry.

433
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,605
Hey family, I'm home.

434
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:10,338
How are you, sweetheart?

435
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:13,072
- Good.
- I come bearing gifts. Follow.

436
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:16,272
What happened? I've been calling.
You don't answer your cell.

437
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:18,684
I was at the bookstore.
I got some great ones for Jonah.

438
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:20,927
<i>James and the Giant Peach.
One fish, two fish.</i>

439
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:22,661
And <i>Everyone Poops.</i>

440
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,138
Where's my boy?
Jonah!

441
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:26,316
- What happened with your friend?
- Nothing.

442
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:28,388
He did offered to doctor
some photos of Preston

443
00:20:28,523 --> 00:20:30,983
and make him look like he had
a young Filipino boyfriend.

444
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:33,827
But when he did it,
it made me feel dirty and it hit me:

445
00:20:33,987 --> 00:20:36,676
what school our son goes to
doesn't matter.

446
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:38,942
It's what type of environment
he comes home to.

447
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:41,320
That's why I wanna make this
the best place ever.

448
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:43,276
He's really not getting in, is he?

449
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:44,536
No, he's not, baby.

450
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,408
But I'm going to read
to him every night.

451
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,186
And we're gonna have
family diners, now.

452
00:20:48,342 --> 00:20:50,742
6 pm, seven nights a week,
no exceptions.

453
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,320
- And no TV.
- Double Ew!

454
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:56,463
I want to be a better man.
A better father and a better husband.

455
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:02,662
- How's my little man?
- Good.

456
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,906
You know, Daddy came home early,
just to read to his buddy,

457
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:09,395
<i>How do dinosaurs say good night?</i>
Is that cool?

458
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,827
- Daddy?
- Yeah, buddy?

459
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:15,161
Am I going to school with Darrin Hornig
next year?

460
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,072
'Cause I really, really want to.

461
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:29,047
That would be...
twenty one hundred.

462
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:31,825
crisp, easily earned dollars.

463
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:33,402
Twenty two hundred

464
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,402
crisp, easily earned dollars.

465
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:37,202
I'm out of here.

466
00:21:37,335 --> 00:21:38,424
Go to see Sloan?

467
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,835
Of course, he is.

468
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:42,435
Just to show my appreciation
for your predictability,

469
00:21:43,054 --> 00:21:45,879
I'm gonna take some of my winnings
to buy you a nice gift certificate

470
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:48,612
to a farm
that'll help you grow some balls.

471
00:21:49,728 --> 00:21:52,501
That's funny. I appreciate that.
But I'm not going to Sloan's

472
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:55,461
but to the hotel to fuck that British
chick I met at the pool today.

473
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,372
So Vince, I'd put your cash away.

474
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:00,205
Looks like the bet still on.

475
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:04,400
Get your suit on!

476
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,879
Come on, come on!

477
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:32,287
- Hi.
- Hi.

478
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:35,087
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, is Mr. Preston here?

479
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,554
I'm here, honey.

480
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,549
- Everything okay?
- It's fine.

481
00:22:38,926 --> 00:22:41,660
Just tell the kids I'll be right in
and lock the door behind you.

482
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:43,793
You have a lovely home.

483
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,615
Thank you.

484
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:52,032
What is the meaning of this?

485
00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:53,788
Well, there's something that I needed...

486
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:55,991
That I'd like to... say to you.

487
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:58,094
Something different
than what you muttered at me

488
00:22:58,229 --> 00:22:59,560
under your breath this morning?

489
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:01,188
You heard that?

490
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,699
What do you want, Mr. Gold?

491
00:23:02,877 --> 00:23:06,370
Just a moment of your time
so that I can say to you that through...

492
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:08,437
this process,

493
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:10,682
I have learned from you, Mr. Preston.

494
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:14,526
You are an educator
and you've educated me about...

495
00:23:15,652 --> 00:23:17,230
being a man,
about being a father,

496
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:19,697
and I know that you can't be bought.

497
00:23:21,074 --> 00:23:23,985
I tried.
I know that you can't be blackmailed.

498
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,519
Because you're too perfect.

499
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,807
But I guess I want to know,
can you be compassionate?

500
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,551
Because, I am...

501
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,640
coming to you, hat and hands,
to ask you...

502
00:23:36,351 --> 00:23:37,617
To beg you

503
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:40,684
to let my son have a proper education.

504
00:23:41,373 --> 00:23:44,223
And don't make him suffer because
he has a way too aggressive father

505
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:46,051
that won't shut up on the soccer field.

506
00:23:48,096 --> 00:23:49,096
Please, sir.

507
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,176
Look at you.

508
00:23:55,554 --> 00:23:58,332
Did you ever think
given your high power status

509
00:23:58,888 --> 00:24:01,443
that you'd ever be reduced
to begging and pleading?

510
00:24:03,414 --> 00:24:04,703
No sir, I didn't.

511
00:24:05,192 --> 00:24:06,326
I didn't.

512
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:10,681
I suppose
there's a first time for everything.

513
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:15,542
I myself never asked anybody
for anything until now.

514
00:24:18,142 --> 00:24:19,409
Is there something you need?

515
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,387
I have a son,

516
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:23,765
a special boy,

517
00:24:24,331 --> 00:24:26,331
who works in the mail room at Abraham's.

518
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:28,042
I think he can do better.

519
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:30,353
How special?

520
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:33,664
'Cause, I love special.

521
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:36,731
Half my lit' department
has an IQ under 65.

522
00:24:37,997 --> 00:24:40,628
So, why don't you tell your boy,

523
00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:42,930
that come Monday,
he's got a desk,

524
00:24:43,464 --> 00:24:46,030
in a real agency
with a real salary.

525
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,675
All right?

526
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,674
The things that we do
for our children, huh?

527
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:54,361
You tell Jonah,

528
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,161
I'm looking forward to his first day,

529
00:24:58,005 --> 00:24:59,583
at Briar Country Day.

530
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,472
But I still don't want to see you
at any soccer games.

531
00:25:07,254 --> 00:25:08,476
I love this town!

532
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:25,139
I feel like I'm dropping my kid off
to go trick-or-treating.

533
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,272
Can't do it, Drama.

534
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,707
- Of course, you can.
- No, I can't.

535
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:35,399
It's bad enough I gotta wear this thing,
but who knows what she'll be wearing?

536
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:38,395
Who cares
if she's dressed like Godzilla.

537
00:25:38,595 --> 00:25:39,683
Close your eyes.

538
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:43,206
Like you used to do when you banged that
ugly chick Judy Lipnick in high school.

539
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,128
You thought Judy was ugly?

540
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,817
Is that debatable?

541
00:25:47,094 --> 00:25:48,628
Whatever, I'm not going in.

542
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:51,450
Fifty percent.

543
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,101
- Sixty.
- You can give me the whole thing,

544
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,501
I just can't do it.

545
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:02,590
Give me the suit, dick!

546
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:04,334
What? What are you gonna do?

547
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:06,068
If I'm dropping five G's,

548
00:26:07,144 --> 00:26:08,700
at least, get me some pussy.

549
00:26:10,188 --> 00:26:11,633
What, am I supposed to sit here?

550
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:35,484
Should we go?

551
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:37,062
What do you say if I said:

552
00:26:37,217 --> 00:26:39,131
"let's blow off the restaurant
and order in?"

553
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,394
I'd say: "Come inside!"
