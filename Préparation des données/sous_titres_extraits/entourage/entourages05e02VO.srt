00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,183
5x02 - Unlike a Virgin

00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,760
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

3
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:21,234
Are we seriously
not going out tonight?

4
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:23,444
- We seriously are not.
- Come on, Vin.

5
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:25,727
- We need to go find some girls.
- I got reading to do.

6
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:27,944
You've been reading all day.
Look at your fingertips.

7
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:30,405
They're all sunburned
from holding scripts over your face.

8
00:01:30,565 --> 00:01:32,374
Give me a break.
There's still plenty to go.

9
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:33,206
Sorry.

10
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,538
You want to go find some ass?

11
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:42,271
- Hi, jaq.
- <i>Hey, Turtle</i>.

12
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:43,526
Bye, Turtle.

13
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,902
Bye, Jaq.
He's touchy.

14
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:52,581
Sorry again.

15
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:55,005
30 awful scripts
to get to one good one.

16
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:56,606
- Yeah?
- It's strong.

17
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:59,167
- Put it on the pile.
- Nice. I like the new work ethic.

18
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:00,418
I don't.

19
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:03,104
Oh, I do love those tits.

20
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,508
- You want to roll to the villa tonight?
- Who, just me and you?

21
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:08,609
Yeah, you're right.

22
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,322
I'll just catch a beat.

23
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,981
What?
Not out here.

24
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:18,997
We're heading
into Ari's office right now.

25
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:21,565
We'll be here for about 15 minutes
then we'll go to lunch,

26
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,669
probably Urth Caffe,
and then the gym.

27
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:26,536
Sportsclub, not Gold's,
cause I did my lats yesterday.

28
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:29,038
I'll do a steam,
maybe a protein shake

29
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:31,324
and then I'll race home
just in time to tuck you in.

30
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,476
Don't you worry, babe.

31
00:02:33,826 --> 00:02:35,329
Oh, I Miss you.

32
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,289
Okay.
Tweet.

33
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:43,628
What, do you tell her
every detail of your day?

34
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:46,023
Jaqueline's the real jealous type.

35
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:48,251
So I got to make sure
all my time is accounted for,

36
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:50,339
otherwise it's nag nag nag.

37
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:52,453
Sounds like a good relationship.

38
00:02:53,483 --> 00:02:55,098
You've had a relationship, Turtle?

39
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:56,975
Look at this.

40
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,186
- Like the good old days, huh?
- Not quite. I've read scripts.

41
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,869
- A lot of scripts.
- You boys are maturing so nicely.

42
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:04,679
- Lloyd.
- Thank you, Lloyd.

43
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,781
So, Vinnie,
I need to formally apologize

44
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:08,745
face to face
for this <i>Danger Beach</i> thing.

45
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:10,480
- Don't.
- I thought it was real.

46
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,682
- We both did.
- I don't care about that.

47
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:15,326
I'm here to move forward.
I'll do any one of these scripts.

48
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:20,415
- He doesn't even have to talk anymore?
- No, I'm gonna mime.

49
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,714
Look at this.
What have we got?

50
00:03:22,874 --> 00:03:25,058
<i>Jarvik</i>, about the guy
who invented the artificial heart.

51
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:27,197
I sent it to you
when you were in Colombia.

52
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,260
- Never heard back from you.
- We were working.

53
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,895
So were they on getting a lead actor.
And they got one. Toby Maguire.

54
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:35,071
Leo's doing
<i>The merchant of Venice Beach</i>.

55
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,334
Wahlberg's doing <i>Milk Bar</i>.
<i>Nine Brave Souls</i>--

56
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:39,974
Maser and Baird. I don't know
what this is. Never heard of them.

57
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:42,638
- I found that one.
- Did you jerk it out of Turtle's cock?

58
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:45,206
Come on, Ari, it's cool.
Take a look.

59
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:50,278
"Dear Vincent Chase's manager.

60
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:53,108
After three years
of turmoil we have completed

61
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:56,226
what we think you'll find to be
a complex and riveting tale of men

62
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:59,621
on a journey to save themselves
from a literal and emotional inferno "

63
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,164
Jesus Christ.

64
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,741
Have we learned nothing
from our past mistakes?

65
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:06,665
We need a go film here, boys.
A studio film.

66
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:09,539
It's a great character piece.
It's about nine firefighters

67
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:12,217
on the night before the biggest fire
they ever fought.

68
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:16,971
No indies, E!

69
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:19,773
Think of it like the holocaust.

70
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,947
Never again, all right?

71
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:24,648
That is what got us here
in the first place.

72
00:04:25,357 --> 00:04:27,524
For the love of God,
this is not for us.

73
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,640
All right,
well what is for us?

74
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:33,323
Right now there is nothing.

75
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:34,781
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

76
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:37,145
- You're in movie jail.
- How do I get out?

77
00:04:37,305 --> 00:04:39,609
- What do I have to do?
- You just do what you've been doing.

78
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:41,782
- You just sit tight. You wait.
- Wait for what?

79
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:44,216
For the stench
from <i>Medellin</i> to disappear.

80
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:45,709
How long's that gonna take?

81
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,044
How long did it take for the air
to clear from Chernobyl?

82
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,928
You want us to sit around
and do nothing?

83
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:52,274
I thought you weren't gonna talk.
But since you are, yes.

84
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:53,696
Sit around and do nothing.

85
00:04:53,856 --> 00:04:56,111
Or maybe go to Vinnie's
supersecret hideaway in Mexico

86
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:58,846
and come back when you're tan
or tall, whichever comes first.

87
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,261
Listen to me.
Listen.

88
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:06,062
We need to rebuild you.

89
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,398
All right?
We've got to start over from scratch.

90
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,500
I will decide when the moment is right.

91
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,878
And then we will pounce
on a greenlit studio picture

92
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:17,352
with an A-list director,
'cause that is what we need.

93
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:20,641
Listen, this is what I do.
Let me be heard this time.

94
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:24,260
I swear to God
you will come back stronger than ever.

95
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:26,416
Like Lance Armstrong,

96
00:05:26,688 --> 00:05:28,080
but with two balls.

97
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:32,759
Hard to believe this is where I'm at?

98
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,484
Hard to believe we're gonna sit
around on our asses and do nothing.

99
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:38,373
There are other things an actor can do
besides waiting around for his agent.

100
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:40,489
Like what?
Somebody's got to hire him to act.

101
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:43,633
Nobody hired Drama when he was doing
the the 3rd street promenade scenes.

102
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:45,826
I didn't do scenes
on the promenade, jerkoff.

103
00:05:45,986 --> 00:05:48,008
The Santa Monica pier once,
and I got paid for that.

104
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:49,818
So what do you think
I can do, Johnny?

105
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:51,684
You can work on your body for one.

106
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:53,443
My body?
What's wrong with my body?

107
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,943
Don't get sensitive, bro.

108
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:58,053
Let's face it, you'd have a tough time
landing the lead in <i>300</i>.

109
00:05:58,213 --> 00:05:59,696
What do you think of this, Turtle?

110
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:02,485
- I liked <i>300</i>.
- You don't like my body either?

111
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,077
Vin, your body is just fine.

112
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:07,257
But I have often thought if we put
your face on Russell Crowe's body

113
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:08,932
we'd have the Terminator of acting.

114
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:11,856
You've thought about Vince's face on
Russell Crowe's body? That's disturbing.

115
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:13,498
I'm actually feeling insecure now.

116
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:15,428
I wanted to talk to you
about that script.

117
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:18,396
You heard Ari. We need a studio movie.
We're gonna listen to him this time.

118
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:20,845
I'm talking about the writers.
Maybe I should sign them.

119
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,939
Give you three
out-of-work clients to work with.

120
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,220
Sorry. I'm really just making fun
of his other clients.

121
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,978
I think it's a good idea.
Worst case,

122
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:29,094
we'll have a nice
management business to feed us.

123
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:30,141
Exactly.

124
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:32,523
Don't look now,
but it's Justine Chapin.

125
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:36,243
Oh, maybe we can get her to feed us.

126
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:40,720
Hi!

127
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,975
How have you been?
How's life?

128
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:44,327
Life's amazing.
You?

129
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:47,926
Sorry.
God, you look incredible.

130
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:51,442
- You too. What are you doing in town?
- Shooting a video for my new album.

131
00:06:51,602 --> 00:06:54,263
New album. That's awesome.
Can't wait to hear it.

132
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:56,400
Don't make fun.

133
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,354
I know my music isn't really your thing.
But this is way different.

134
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:01,172
- It's very sophisticated.
- I'm sure.

135
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:03,534
I've grown up.
I'm doing duets with Tony Bennett.

136
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:06,012
- I love Tony Bennett.
- He's amazing.

137
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:08,885
We're finishing the video today
and having a wrap party.

138
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:11,419
- You guys should come.
- I got a girlfriend.

139
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:13,840
You should come, Vince.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,178
Well, I'm off today,
so why not?

141
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:17,904
Okay, I'll text you the address.

142
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:19,297
- Great.
- See you.

143
00:07:19,457 --> 00:07:20,939
- Bye.
- See you.

144
00:07:22,324 --> 00:07:24,217
Fuck the gym.
My body's fine.

145
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,540
- Aw, fuck! What the--
- That's all right.

146
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,509
What's the matter with you today, buddy?

147
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:32,007
Focus is off.

148
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:34,344
What's the problem?
You got marital woes?

149
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:35,931
No, client trouble.

150
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:38,171
You need me to hunt down
some commissions for you?

151
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:40,119
It's Vinnie Chase.
There are no commissions.

152
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,010
Oh, man. Screened <i>Medellin</i> last night.
Fell asleep halfway through.

153
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,597
Don't worry about Vinnie.
It's all good.

154
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,227
I'm making so much money
you're gonna be all right, buddy.

155
00:07:54,944 --> 00:07:57,395
Jesus, come on.
That's a nice shot.

156
00:07:58,174 --> 00:08:00,694
- I'm going again.
- Hit until you're happy.

157
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:02,253
It's your club.

158
00:08:04,513 --> 00:08:06,128
I love this kid the way I love you.

159
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:08,801
He comes into my office today
with four scripts that he wants to do,

160
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:11,348
none of which he can get.
I don't know what to say to him.

161
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:13,123
You were always good at lying.

162
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:15,214
What are you talking about?
I never lied to you.

163
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:17,497
And when you told me you liked
<i>The Truth About Charlie</i>?

164
00:08:17,657 --> 00:08:19,485
- What is <i>The truth about charlie</i>?
- Exactly.

165
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:21,573
- Hit E ball, please.
- Look where we are now.

166
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:24,470
What about Vinnie?
Think he's gonna be all right?

167
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:26,678
50-50.

168
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,474
Fucking rusty cunt bucket!

169
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:33,260
- Fuck!
- I wasn't laughing.

170
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:40,438
Bullets and bitches,
L.B. here.

171
00:08:40,598 --> 00:08:42,080
I'm looking for Nick or Lawrence.

172
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,888
L.B. stands for Lawrence, hot dog.
Is there a problem?

173
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:47,908
No, my name is Eric Murphy.
I'm a talent manager from Los Angeles.

174
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:49,682
<i>I represent Vincent Chase.</i>

175
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:52,037
You sent me your script.
I'd love to talk to you about it.

176
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:54,539
Don't tell me this is one
of them prank shows. We got guns.

177
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:56,373
No prank, L.B.
I loved your script.

178
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,126
Holy fuck!
I'm freakin'!

179
00:08:58,286 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm fuh-fuckin' freakin'.
Are you serious?

180
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:03,528
Oh, damn.
Vincent Chase wants to do our movie.

181
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:06,635
No, actually I wanted to talk
to you guys about representation.

182
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,263
I'd better get Nick.

183
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:12,550
How about I come out there
and see you guys?

184
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,249
All right. Yeah, I guess.
I guess that'd be all right.

185
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,523
How do you know
she's not a virgin anymore?

186
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,299
It's been all over the papers.
Her last few albums haven't sold.

187
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:22,886
I should not be here right now.

188
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:25,167
You know I had a thing
for this girl back in the day.

189
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:27,450
- But you never closed.
- I wasn't gonna be her first.

190
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,813
I know your motto, never be the first,
never be the last.

191
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:32,190
- Could you guys just take me home?
- Shut up.

192
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,788
- Maybe I'll call a cab.
- What is the problem?

193
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:37,179
The problem is
when I gave Jaq my itinerary

194
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,133
I didn't account on time
being spent with non-virgins.

195
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,588
It's almost 10:00 in France.
I'm supposed to be home

196
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,925
so I can tuck her in on the computer.
If not, she's gonna freak.

197
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,832
Why do you want to be in a relationship
with someone this crazy?

198
00:09:48,992 --> 00:09:51,923
Obsession is a huge turn on to me, bro.

199
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:18,713
You are so gonna bang this girl.

200
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:21,835
She can be real trouble for me,
I'm telling you.

201
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:24,368
If you and Drama both have girlfriends,
I'm gonna shoot myself.

202
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:26,811
I hope I have a girlfriend
after tonight.

203
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:28,955
I'm gonna go call her.

204
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:45,529
- Allô?
- Hey, babe.

205
00:10:45,918 --> 00:10:49,037
Hello, Johnny.
Are you ready to video?

206
00:10:49,197 --> 00:10:52,991
No, my stupid Internet's down.
Modern technology sucks.

207
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:54,759
Did you try resetting the modem?

208
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,661
Yeah, like three times.
No go.

209
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,483
I'm sorry if I let you down tonight.

210
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:01,335
You didn't let me down.

211
00:11:01,892 --> 00:11:03,668
But I do like to see you.

212
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,712
I like to see you too, baby.

213
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:08,214
Are you listening to Tony Bennett?

214
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:13,678
Yeah.
I was just playing some cds.

215
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:15,891
I love Tony Bennett.

216
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:19,282
Oh yeah? So do I.
I didn't know you loved Tony Bennett.

217
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:22,354
I guess we still have some things
left to uncover about each other, huh?

218
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:27,682
Yeah, I guess so.

219
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:45,778
So let me try to understand something.

220
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,590
You represent Vincent Chase,
you want to represent us,

221
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,338
we want Vincent Chase
but you can't get us Vincent Chase.

222
00:11:52,498 --> 00:11:54,343
He's looking to do
a studio movie right now.

223
00:11:54,503 --> 00:11:56,509
- Oh, he is?
- So what can you get us?

224
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:58,301
I think I can get you a job writing.

225
00:11:58,461 --> 00:12:01,393
Why do we need a job when we spent three
years of our lives writing the script?

226
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:04,979
- Maybe if it's a real writing job--
- L.B., wait. Hold on for a second.

227
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:06,514
L.B. gets a little excited

228
00:12:06,674 --> 00:12:09,241
by the appearance of a fancy car
and nice clothes. No offense.

229
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:11,441
This script has our life's
blood dripped into it.

230
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:14,072
- As your manager, Nick--
- As the manager

231
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,117
of Vincent Chase
who can't get us Vincent Chase,

232
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:20,036
who do you manage
that you can get for us?

233
00:12:20,196 --> 00:12:22,163
- You got Shia Labeouf?
- Listen,

234
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:25,667
managers don't necessarily
get you stars for your movies, Nick.

235
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:27,393
What I can do,
what I will do,

236
00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:29,366
is passionately sell you
guys to the town

237
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:31,705
so that people will pay you
lots of money

238
00:12:31,865 --> 00:12:33,633
to do what you did
so well on this script.

239
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,240
I mean, let me do that.

240
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,319
What do I have to do to prove to you
I'm the one that can change your lives?

241
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:40,715
Sell the script--
<i>Nine Brave Souls</i>.

242
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,101
That's what you can do.

243
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:59,741
- Just calm down.
- I can't calm down, Turtle.

244
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,128
I never should have lied to her.
Jaq knows me too well.

245
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,801
It's like the tone of my voice
is her own truth serum.

246
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:08,777
You're not doing anything wrong
so stop worrying about it.

247
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:12,201
I appreciate the advice, Turtle,
but you don't understand crazy broads

248
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:15,792
'cause nobody's ever been attracted
enough to you to act psycho.

249
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:20,134
I'm gonna call her back
and try and gauge her temperature.

250
00:13:20,294 --> 00:13:21,723
Good luck with that.

251
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:24,058
You guys have an amazing chemistry.

252
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:27,552
Wow, this is like a mutual
admiration society.

253
00:13:27,712 --> 00:13:29,644
- Loved <i>Aquaman</i>.
- Thank you.

254
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:31,900
I haven't got a chance
to see the suel yet.

255
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,237
Don't worry, I'm not in it.
Jake Gyllenhaal is.

256
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,083
I guess you had your reasons.

257
00:13:36,243 --> 00:13:38,115
Anyway, it was a pleasure
meeting you.

258
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,870
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

259
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,327
And, sweetheart,
I'll see you in a bit.

260
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:47,600
- Isn't he awesome?
- Yeah, he is.

261
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:50,176
I have someone else
I would like you to meet.

262
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:52,793
Yes. See the pink dress over
there with the incredible legs?

263
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,174
She's so in love with you
and she's amazing.

264
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:57,690
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

265
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,834
I'm gonna go get her.
Be right back.

266
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:03,572
What's going on?

267
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:06,440
I'm not sure,
but I think I'm being pawned off.

268
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,113
- Get out of here.
- Something very off about today.

269
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:11,959
She's not answering.
I'm freaking out. She must be pissed.

270
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:13,602
She must be sleeping.

271
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:17,886
I just talked to her 10 minutes ago.
Baby Jaq don't fall asleep that fast.

272
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,457
Maybe she's on the can
taking a shit.

273
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,336
Yeah, let's hope so.

274
00:14:23,675 --> 00:14:25,330
I'll call her back in 10.

275
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:29,075
Vince, Michella.
Michella, Vince.

276
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,541
Hi.

277
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,980
So, Justine, you have any other
spare friends lying around for me?

278
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,028
E's on the phone.

279
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,856
why?

280
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,473
I don't know,
but he sounds enthusiastic.

281
00:14:49,924 --> 00:14:52,074
- What?
- Jesus, be less friendly.

282
00:14:52,234 --> 00:14:54,214
If you have business
to discuss, start talking.

283
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:56,303
I want to talk to you
about that script I found.

284
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,642
- <i>What did I tell you this morning?</i>
- Relax. I'm not calling about Vince.

285
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:01,838
- I want to sign the writers.
- Why would I care?

286
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:04,670
Because I want to sell their script.
I need an agent to help me do that.

287
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:06,546
Try the yellow pages.

288
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:10,222
Come on. I'm calling you as a friend.
I need your help.

289
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:12,219
<i>It's a really good script.
Can you help me?</i>

290
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,078
Yes I can, E.
Lloyd.

291
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:16,423
Get the number for UCLA extension

292
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,744
<i>so Eric can take a course to finally
learn how the movie business works.</i>

293
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:22,696
- You won't help me, Ari?
- We share one client, E.

294
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:24,486
We're never gonna share two.

295
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:28,258
Here you go.

296
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:30,973
So how long have you been a dancer?

297
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:34,007
Since I was three.
So like 19 years.

298
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:36,176
I thought you said you were 27.

299
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:37,189
So?

300
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,080
Still no answer.
I don't know what to do.

301
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,487
- Keep trying.
- Who's not answering?

302
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:44,400
My girlfriend.
She's pissed at me.

303
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,653
- Why, what did you do?
- I lied to her.

304
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,855
I said I was home
when I was at a party.

305
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,513
But she has no way
of knowing that he lied.

306
00:15:51,673 --> 00:15:54,145
But it's night in Paris
and she's not answering her phone so,

307
00:15:54,305 --> 00:15:56,530
- he's freaking out.
- This is unreal. And it's her fault.

308
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,188
If she wasn't so fucking possessive
I wouldn't have to lie to her.

309
00:15:59,348 --> 00:16:01,434
- Maybe she's sleeping.
- That's what I said.

310
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:04,102
You're both wrong
'cause the ring would have woke her up.

311
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:06,131
So either she's pissed
and not answering

312
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,983
- or she's being held captive.
- There's a third choice.

313
00:16:09,143 --> 00:16:11,077
- What's that?
- She's out.

314
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:13,893
- Out where?
- Maybe a party. You are.

315
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,634
You think my girl would lie to me?

316
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:19,050
I told my boyfriend
I was at an audition today.

317
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,820
He gets really upset when I'm out.

318
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:23,659
I'm calling her back.

319
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:28,495
So with all that dancing,

320
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,164
can you do any crazy shit
like put your legs behind you head?

321
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:33,387
I told you I have a boyfriend.

322
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,969
You did.
But you also said you lie to him.

323
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,053
So maybe you could tell him
that we didn't fuck today.

324
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:46,487
Baby, it's me again.

325
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:50,417
I'd like to think you're sleeping,
but nobody could sleep through this.

326
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:53,909
Where the fuck are you?!
Pick up the fucking phone!

327
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:57,865
Didn't his mother ever tell him
not to speak like that?

328
00:16:59,257 --> 00:17:01,528
I remember the first time
you and Justine went out.

329
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,564
I was still living in Ohio
and I was so jealous.

330
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,631
I've had a crush on you
since you did that Mentos commercial.

331
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:10,294
Oh, wow, that was
a long time ago, huh?

332
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:13,794
I should get extra credit for liking you
even before you were a giant movie star.

333
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:15,604
Yes, you should.

334
00:17:18,094 --> 00:17:19,709
Uh, listen, Michelle,

335
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,549
would you excuse me for a second?
I have to make a quick phone call.

336
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,551
- Yeah, sure. But, Vince.
- Yeah?

337
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,881
It's Michella.

338
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:28,755
But you can call me Michelle
if you like that better.

339
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:30,693
I'll be right back.

340
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,662
Hey, Lloyd, is Ari there?
I need to talk to him.

341
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,831
He's in a screening right now.
Is everything okay?

342
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:41,001
Actually, no it's not.
Can you get him out?

343
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:44,292
Tell him I'll be there in 10
minutes. I really need to talk.

344
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:04,024
- Vince is gonna be here in 10 minutes.
- Jesus!

345
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,799
What do you want to do?

346
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:09,729
I can't walk out of here 'cause
the director is sitting right behind me.

347
00:18:10,786 --> 00:18:12,234
So what should I do?

348
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:18,772
Pull the plug on the projector.

349
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:21,232
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, go.

350
00:18:32,818 --> 00:18:34,182
What the hell?

351
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,958
Can we fix this fucking
projector already?

352
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:41,528
I'm sorry, man. I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna hit the bathroom real quick.

353
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:45,165
Could someone fix
the fucking projector?

354
00:18:45,437 --> 00:18:47,441
- So what did he say the problem is?
- He didn't.

355
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:50,303
But if I had to guess I'd say you
didn't make him very happy this morning.

356
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,902
Like it's my fault.

357
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,475
- You calling to apologize?
- <i>I'm calling to tell you</i>

358
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:02,107
<i>that I blame you for every bad
thing that's ever happened to Vince,</i>

359
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,177
and every bad thing that ever could
happen to him for the rest of his life.

360
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:07,691
You're the unfucking lucky charm.
You hear me?

361
00:19:07,851 --> 00:19:10,282
<i>You should never utter the words
"I've found a good script"</i>

362
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,851
'cause you have no idea what a
good fucking script looks like.

363
00:19:13,011 --> 00:19:14,299
Live with that.

364
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,304
Mr. Murphy,
miss daniels will see you now.

365
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,495
Thank you.

366
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:28,360
Well, this is a surprise.

367
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:31,707
How could you do this to me?

368
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:33,680
Six months
I've been nothing but faithful.

369
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,184
Do you have any idea how much pussy
is thrown at me day and night?

370
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:39,986
And I pass on all of it.
For what?

371
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:42,322
So you could run around
fucking every French faggot

372
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,308
that pays you a compliment?

373
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:45,387
Baby?

374
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:47,286
Where the fuck have you been?

375
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:50,397
I was at the hospital.
My friend had a car accident.

376
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,239
- What friend?
- Lily.

377
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:53,838
Hi, Johnny.

378
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:56,770
Oh, hey, lily.

379
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:59,406
- How are you doing?
- I've been better. You?

380
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:00,874
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

381
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:03,306
Jaq, are you okay?

382
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,446
No, Johnny,
I'm not okay.

383
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:09,044
I knew you were a little crazy
when you said

384
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:11,418
we needed to get on
the computer every night,

385
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:14,654
but I had to call the police
on my last boyfriend.

386
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,023
I don't want to have
to call the police on you.

387
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:18,851
- Goodbye, Johnny.
- Wait wait!

388
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,653
Baby.

389
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,362
So why aren't you keeping
this for Vince?

390
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,812
Ari only wants Vince
to do a go studio movie.

391
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:34,474
- Do you agree?
- Yeah.

392
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,635
I mean, if he can get one.
What do you think?

393
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:39,145
I think we don't work
together anymore, Eric.

394
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:41,648
But if this script is
as good as you say it is

395
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:43,683
seems like Vince could use it.

396
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:47,153
On the other hand, you are one more
bad choice away from ruining his career.

397
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,814
Thanks.

398
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:51,455
- So did Ari read it?
- Nope.

399
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:55,695
- So what makes you think I will?
- You have a better work ethic.

400
00:20:56,115 --> 00:20:58,258
Look at that.
See? You almost smiled.

401
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,033
Now look, it's really good.

402
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:02,394
I promise you I wouldn't waste
your time if it wasn't.

403
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:05,030
Just read 10 pages of it
and you'll be hooked, guaranteed.

404
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,599
- Please.
- Leave it, I'll read five.

405
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:22,489
- He's here. Vince is here.
- What, are you speedballing fairy dust?

406
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,683
Go out there
and greet him like a man.

407
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:30,255
Vinnie. There he is.
How you doing, baby?

408
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,599
To be honest, Ari,
not great.

409
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:35,694
I haven't said that
very many times in my life.

410
00:21:35,854 --> 00:21:37,736
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

411
00:21:38,154 --> 00:21:40,817
I came back from Mexico
motivated, ready to work

412
00:21:40,977 --> 00:21:43,969
and correct me if I'm wrong,
you basically said that I can't.

413
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:46,587
- No no, what I said was--
- I know what you said.

414
00:21:46,747 --> 00:21:48,648
I just want to know what it means.

415
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:50,903
Do you really have a plan, Ari?
Really?

416
00:21:51,063 --> 00:21:53,746
You always said you were going
to give it to me straight, so come on.

417
00:21:53,906 --> 00:21:56,056
Give it to me straight.
Am I gonna be okay?

418
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:58,450
I don't know.

419
00:22:00,865 --> 00:22:03,830
I mean, one bad movie
and this is what happens?

420
00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:06,295
Was I really that awful?

421
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:10,791
Straight up, Vinnie,
the movie was awful.

422
00:22:12,021 --> 00:22:13,493
And yes, you were awful in it.

423
00:22:13,653 --> 00:22:16,204
But you know what?
One bad movie can be overcome.

424
00:22:16,364 --> 00:22:18,788
Look at Colin Farrell.
He's overcome dozens of them

425
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:21,781
because the perception of him
is he's a movie star.

426
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,451
- And what's the perception of me?
- That you don't give a fuck.

427
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:28,008
You refuse to play the game.
You refuse to be a part of the process.

428
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:30,670
Look, the great ones,
even if they don't care,

429
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,479
they pretend they do.

430
00:22:35,378 --> 00:22:36,933
Do you think I'm a good actor?

431
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:41,201
I did not sign you in the first place
'cause I thought you could act.

432
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,637
I signed you because I thought
you were a movie star.

433
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:46,985
And you haven't acted like one
in a long time.

434
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:51,136
I'm ready to play the game, Ari.
Whatever you say.

435
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:53,847
- That's a good start.
- But I'm not willing to wait.

436
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:56,971
I want you to send me in to every person
in this town who's willing to meet me.

437
00:22:57,131 --> 00:22:58,670
I don't care if it wastes my time,

438
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,887
I will charm the fuck
out of every last one of them.

439
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,822
Filmmakers,
studio execs

440
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,791
all of them,
I will change the perception.

441
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,505
I like the fire.

442
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:15,001
You don't believe I'm a good actor?

443
00:23:15,705 --> 00:23:17,307
It remains to be seen.

444
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:21,239
But, Vin, I'm starting to believe
that you're a movie star again.

445
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,217
And you know what?

446
00:23:23,377 --> 00:23:25,065
This town loves a comeback.

447
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:27,984
And since Britney fucked hers up,
it's all you!

448
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,850
Thanks, bud.

449
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:39,492
Hey, Vinnie, over here.

450
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:42,529
- Yo, vin, we're leaving.
- Give me two minutes.

451
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:43,993
I'll be right back.

452
00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:51,491
Where did you go? I've been waiting.
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.

453
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:56,576
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second?

454
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:58,812
- Where are you going?
- Vince, what?

455
00:23:59,222 --> 00:24:02,215
Why did you invite me if you were just
going to pawn me off on your friend?

456
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,729
- I thought you'd like her.
- I like you.

457
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,732
Vince, if I fuck you

458
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:10,115
then I'll want to be your girlfriend.

459
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:12,317
And I don't want to be
in a relationship right now.

460
00:24:12,477 --> 00:24:14,739
So last time, you were too innocent.
Now you're too slutty?

461
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,882
- Now I'm having fun.
- So we'll have fun.

462
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,574
Keep it casual.
Get serious in the future.

463
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:21,901
And if we fuck up any chance
of having a future?

464
00:24:22,518 --> 00:24:23,873
I'll risk it if you will.

465
00:24:26,355 --> 00:24:28,174
How long are we just gonna sit here for?

466
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:29,809
Till Vince comes out.

467
00:24:30,657 --> 00:24:33,513
I'm getting really bored
and it's giving me time to think.

468
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,385
It's not a good thing for you.

469
00:24:35,803 --> 00:24:38,918
I understand.
And try not to take this as an insult,

470
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,683
but as gorgeous as you are,
I'd never ditch Vince for you.

471
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:44,686
Well, I like your loyalty.

472
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,479
Yeah?
How much?

473
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:51,857
Jesus christ, Drama.
Where the hell have you been?

474
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:54,904
I've been drinking.

475
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,862
You okay?

476
00:25:00,184 --> 00:25:01,467
Do I look okay?

477
00:25:02,942 --> 00:25:05,503
- There's Vince.
- Well, look at this.

478
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,017
Let's roll.

479
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:14,350
- Hey, Johnny.
- Hey.

480
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:21,294
You guys really kind of
like each other, huh?

481
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:22,858
Uh, maybe.

482
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,598
That's great.

483
00:25:25,954 --> 00:25:27,624
That's just fucking great.
