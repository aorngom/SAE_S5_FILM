3
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,190
So, first party
the new place, huh, Drama?

4
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,934
Don't be ignorant, E.
It's not a party, it's a get-together.

5
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:19,945
And the difference is what?

6
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,324
Get-together is less than
a dozen people, bro.

7
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:25,109
Don't be ignorant, 'cause
this is definitely gonna be a party.

8
00:01:25,176 --> 00:01:28,037
Or simultaneous get-togethers if
it makes it easier for you to swallow.

9
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,383
What are you guys talking about?

10
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,682
We're welcoming home Vinnie Chase!
People want to come.

11
00:01:31,732 --> 00:01:34,126
I thought we agreed to keep it small...
a family affair.

12
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:35,592
I never signed anything.

13
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:37,226
If you want to do it at the hotel...?

14
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,434
No no, bro,
this is your welcome-home party.

15
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:40,705
We can't do it at a hotel.

16
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:42,449
Now that I have a beautiful home,

17
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,787
I'd be honored to welcome you
and your party.

18
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:46,601
I just need to know how many people.

19
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,361
I'd have to check the evite rsvp list

20
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:51,465
Before I could accurately
respond to that.

21
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:54,673
- <I>Calm down, baby!</I>
- Do not tell me to calm down!

22
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,482
They're giving my son a hard time!

23
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,105
<I>My baby boy. A mother gets protective
when that happens.</I>

24
00:01:59,156 --> 00:02:01,490
What did they say?
Did they say that he's not getting in?

25
00:02:01,523 --> 00:02:03,137
They wouldn't say anything on the phone,

26
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:05,392
Just that they'd like to see us.
They're like the CIA.

27
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,142
Then relax.
He's getting in.

28
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:09,061
- Well, he better, Ari.
- <I>He's a legacy!</I>

29
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:12,108
Legacies are as sure a thing
as me having to beg for blowjobs.

30
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:15,601
Little Jonah will be a proud member
of the Briar country day school

31
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:16,948
Just like his sister,

32
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,187
- <I>fear not.</I>
- Begging won't be enough if he isn't.

33
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,591
I got to go, baby.
I'll see you at the school.

34
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:24,909
Welcome Vinnie Chase home tonight.
Here's the address.

35
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:30,165
Sorry, limited space.

36
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:32,032
What? I didn't invite the dude.

37
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:33,849
- Lloyd, you miss us?
- I did, I did.

38
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:36,055
- Welcome back, boys.
- Lloyd, how are you?

39
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,436
- Great.
- What up, Lloyd?

40
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,583
Nothing, not much.

41
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,627
So I spent all evening
preparing a little something

42
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,628
for the big bash...
creme brulee.

43
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,590
It's not a bash, Lloyd.
It's a large get-together.

44
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,197
Whatever it is, Drama,

45
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:50,402
Is it okay if I bring four friends?

46
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,271
What sort of friends?

47
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:55,260
It's fine, Lloyd. Just no public
displays of affection, all right?

48
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:56,388
Is that Vinnie Chase?

49
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:58,844
Oh my god!
Look at that!

50
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,099
I don't believe...
usually I have to get "us weekly"

51
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,530
to get a look at those pretty eyes.

52
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,217
And I have to look at the wee
bottom, lower corner of the frame

53
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,118
to see the top
of this little man's head.

54
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:09,439
You look a little pudgy, Ari.

55
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:12,505
- You put on a little weight?
- You wish! Six percent body fat.

56
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:14,844
Achieve that when you're 40,
and I'll give you 100 grand.

57
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,478
- When'd you get in?
- Late last night.

58
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:19,661
- You coming to the welcome-home party?
- We understand if you can't make it.

59
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:21,445
I will be there. First things first.

60
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,154
- Do I look heavy?
- No, you look good.

61
00:03:24,252 --> 00:03:26,137
- Yeah, baby!
- What?

62
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,558
Oh, this broad I met on myspace,
she's coming...

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,272
with her sorority.

64
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:35,714
- So, Italy was good?
- It was amazing.

65
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,086
Leave it to E to pick
the most romantic spot on earth

66
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,303
- right after he gets dumped.
- We're taking a break.

67
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,053
Whatever. So, you planning
another vacation or you gonna step up?

68
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:44,761
Vince is planning
on going back to work.

69
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:46,109
As an actor,

70
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,456
or as a producer
of another jungle quagmire?

71
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:50,501
The movie that's gonna
take us to the next level,

72
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:51,958
you're writing it off as a disaster?

73
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,432
I am writing it off as MIA
and proceeding accordingly.

74
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,341
He always was so nervous.

75
00:03:57,395 --> 00:03:59,838
I know... is that how you keep
the pounds off? By trembling?

76
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,508
What do you expect? <i>Medellin</i>
has been delayed month after month.

77
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,945
You've got a director who refuses
to show a single frame to anybody.

78
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,191
- We're seeing it today.
- Bullshit.

79
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:10,245
Every frame of it.
Why do you think we came back?

80
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:11,988
- And we're out of money.
- There's that.

81
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:13,444
- Are you?
- You know they charge

82
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:15,089
up to $30 for a bowl of penne?

83
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:16,755
Vince wants a job.
Tell us what you got.

84
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,191
- I gotta see the movie.
- Not gonna happen.

85
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:20,989
Walsh won't even let Rubinstein see it.

86
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:23,685
He understands that at some point
everyone's gonna see it, right?

87
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:25,864
At some point, everyone will.
We're seeing it today

88
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,384
And we're telling you he needs a job.

89
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,065
I'm telling you that
I need to see it.

90
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,974
What does one thing
have to do with the other?

91
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:33,138
- connect the fucking dots.
- No one's gonna hire me

92
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,406
- until they've seen <i>Medellin</i>?
- I wouldn't say no one.

93
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,561
You can play jughead
in a new archies live-action.

94
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:40,946
I think I'm more of a Reggie.

95
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,944
Right now, no one is gonna
offer you something you want

96
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:46,452
Or give you the kind
of money that we want.

97
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,033
You can understand that, right?

98
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,122
- Actually, I can't.
- The word on the street

99
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,915
since day one of production
on <i>Medellin</i>

100
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:54,226
has not been good.

101
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:56,562
Dps and actors fired,
production delays,

102
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,796
unstable director.

103
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,132
No one wants to put
Vince's face on a poster

104
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,669
with the possibility of a looming
disaster hanging out there.

105
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,196
It's the "gigli" effect.

106
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,139
Okay, so what do we need?

107
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,049
We need for <i>medellin</i> to be good.

108
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:14,780
Just tell me there's not going
to be more than 75 people.

109
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,849
There's not gonna be
more than 75 people.

110
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:18,684
- Really?
- No, not really.

111
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,824
- That's what you told me to tell you.
- Dick.

112
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:22,722
Why do you need baby wipes?

113
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,219
Just get what's on the list.

114
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:27,451
- 50 cartons?
- Please, don't question me, all right?

115
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:28,827
All right, fine fine.

116
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,664
It says "12 barbecued chicken wings."
You mean 1200?

117
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,866
No, I meant what I wrote... 12.
They're for Vince.

118
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,555
He loves the wings at Costco,

119
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:38,671
But I'm not letting everyone else
go wild with barbecued chicken wings.

120
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,506
So what's everyone else
gonna eat, then?

121
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,141
Celery.
Read the list.

122
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:44,216
- Celery?
- Yeah, and carrots.

123
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:46,043
Look, the party's called for 9:00 pm.

124
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:48,897
That's not a dinner party.
So only Vince is gonna eat real food.

125
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:52,389
Everyone else is gonna
have nice, clean, stain-free

126
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:54,320
- celery and carrots.
- Great.

127
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,569
Think you guys have
enough baby wipes?

128
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:59,396
No no, it's not what it looks like...
they're for a party.

129
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:00,869
You wanna come?

130
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,830
You like that one, huh?

131
00:06:07,663 --> 00:06:09,817
- I could do a play.
- You could.

132
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,893
A play's not gonna
buy us a new house, though.

133
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:14,106
It'd have to be a very
successful play, I think.

134
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,003
Cavalry's arrived.
People, man your posts.

135
00:06:17,164 --> 00:06:18,499
Prepare to do battle.

136
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:20,861
He looks good.
How are you, Billy?

137
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,048
Living and thriving, suit.
Living and thriving.

138
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:25,050
- What's up?
- How you doing?

139
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:27,121
Just this, nothing else up.

140
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:30,735
Come on back. I'll show
you the facilities. Come on.

141
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,907
Cutting the old-fashioned way, huh?

142
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:36,528
Why fuck a woman with a vibrator
when you've got a dick,

143
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:38,468
- Right, suit?
- I don't know what that means,

144
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:40,274
but we're excited to see
what you've done.

145
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:43,797
Hey, everybody! You've been
looking at this guy's beautiful face

146
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:46,405
for the past three months.
Vinnie Chase.

147
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:50,965
And this is his suit,
though he don't dress the part.

148
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,479
Guys, my whole crew is latin...

149
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,382
helped make this film as
absolutely authentic as it could be.

150
00:06:56,615 --> 00:07:00,252
My editor, Raul, and his
assistant-slash-little-brother, Tero.

151
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:02,441
Both mexican.
Both totally legal.

152
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:04,559
My post guy is Brazilian.

153
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:06,744
The caterers are from Chile.

154
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,695
Every Thursday we get
that endangered sea bass flown in.

155
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:12,431
- What's she do?
- She gives blowjobs.

156
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:14,364
seriously.

157
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:17,465
She's a streetwalker
I brought back from colombia. Good eyes.

158
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,830
So can we get this thing going or what?

159
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,235
You want to eat first?
You want something?

160
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:23,542
- I'm okay.
- We got empanadas.

161
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,044
- I'm all good.
- Want an empanada?

162
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,619
- We just ate.
- How about a tamale?

163
00:07:26,673 --> 00:07:29,008
- We're all good.
- What about one of those blowjobs?

164
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:32,484
What, does Turtle check
your balls for lipstick?

165
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,395
- Quit stalling.
- I'm not fucking stalling.

166
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,280
We really want to see it, come on.

167
00:07:36,558 --> 00:07:38,445
And I want you to see it, vin. I do.

168
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,526
Uh, it's just not ready.

169
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,028
It's... it's not ready.
I need a little bit more time.

170
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,789
- What are you talking about?
- How much more time?

171
00:07:47,153 --> 00:07:49,013
- 3 weeks, a month tops.
- You can't have it.

172
00:07:49,116 --> 00:07:50,141
- Who says?
- I say.

173
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:52,661
- Who the fuck are you?
- The guy with the fucking checkbook.

174
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:54,792
We just flew from Italy,
you said it'd be ready.

175
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:56,709
I thought I was ready, man.
I thought I was,

176
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,790
But I watched it
this morning and I'm not.

177
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,113
Billy, listen,
I understand you're nervous.

178
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,971
But we've both seen first cuts...
we know what we're looking at.

179
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,118
I can't.
It's just not ready.

180
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,072
You only get one chance
for a first impression.

181
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:10,014
All right, look, here's the deal, okay?

182
00:08:10,095 --> 00:08:12,927
We see this film today or not another
dollar comes into this facility.

183
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,760
Not for cigarettes,
not for coffee,

184
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,729
Not for sea bass and
not for fucking blowjobs,

185
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,241
Do you understand what I'm saying?

186
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:21,666
Yeah, I do.

187
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:24,974
Raul, prepare the projector.

188
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:28,870
I'm just gonna piss
really quickly, okay?

189
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,045
- Was I too harsh?
- No, perfect.

190
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,616
Sorry, Vinnie!
Go fuck yourself, suit!

191
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,901
Maybe you were a little harsh.

192
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,670
- So?
- So.

193
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:51,369
So.

194
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,365
- This is awkward.
- What's awkward?

195
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,159
We don't even know why we're here.

196
00:08:55,593 --> 00:08:56,780
But we are concerned.

197
00:08:57,213 --> 00:08:58,455
We're very concerned.

198
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,812
I mean, we know Jonah

199
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:02,806
Just had his evaluation.
But we thought it was a formality.

200
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:05,302
I mean, he's a legacy.

201
00:09:05,707 --> 00:09:07,930
Well, his sister Sarah
has been a model student here

202
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:09,620
for almost eight years.

203
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,020
I mean, isn't a sibling
guaranteed admission?

204
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:14,486
We can never make any guarantees.

205
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:17,489
That's not what you said when
I was writing all those donation checks.

206
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:21,151
So, was there a problem
with Jonah's evaluation?

207
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:22,928
Well, he did hit a kid with a ruler.

208
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,638
- Yes, he told us that.
- He told us all

209
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:26,768
the kid was trying
to steal his power ranger.

210
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,717
And I teach my son never to let
people just take things from him.

211
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,685
It's my Israeli blood, okay?

212
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,573
You can't tell us
that he might not be able

213
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:36,714
- to go to school here because of that?
- I'm not telling you that.

214
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:39,299
- this is just a courtesy.
- A courtesy?

215
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,682
We want you to have time to apply
to another school, just in case.

216
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,084
Just in case what?

217
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,015
Just in case he doesn't get in.

218
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:48,687
What a smug bitch.

219
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,536
Just sitting there with that stupid look
on her stupid fucking face.

220
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:54,179
- The cursing. We're at the school.
- I'm sorry, I'm upset.

221
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,905
I know, it's kind of hot. I like it.

222
00:09:55,987 --> 00:09:58,197
- Ari, why aren't you upset?
- She's just a secretary,

223
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,366
A low-level messenger.
No time to deal with that.

224
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,766
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna go to our old buddy,

225
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:04,076
Dr. Reich.
A higher level.

226
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,939
- What can he do?
- He is on the board of trustees, baby.

227
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,609
We didn't spend all those nights

228
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,702
at his queer piano parties for nothing.
He'll take care of it.

229
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,245
I think I should go with you.

230
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:15,939
- Baby, this is man's work.
- Man's work?

231
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,178
I am going to have to apply
a little bit of pressure.

232
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:20,219
Trust me,
you do not want to see this, all right?

233
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,969
Don't worry, I'm gonna handle it.

234
00:10:22,118 --> 00:10:23,359
Trust me.

235
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:37,860
Damn, Drama,
this place is looking good.

236
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:41,240
Yeah, and it's gonna keep looking
that way, so take your shoes off.

237
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,442
You want me to take my shoes off?

238
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:46,078
Everybody's gonna be
going shoeless tonight.

239
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,814
So don't think your smelly feet
are getting any special attention.

240
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,284
There's gonna be a sign right
there that says "no shoes"

241
00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:53,018
and a basket right there
to house them.

242
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,170
You might want to get a sign
and a basket for bras,

243
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:57,523
'cause these sorority girls,
they sound kinda freaky.

244
00:10:57,784 --> 00:10:59,159
They just better be neat.

245
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:02,586
- Grab that end.
- Where's it going?

246
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:04,955
In the bedroom.
It's only two weeks old,

247
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:07,266
- I don't want anyone sitting on it.
- Are you for real?

248
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:10,179
What kind of party is this gonna be
if people don't have a place to sit?

249
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,768
First of all, I got sturdy folding
chairs in my storage closet.

250
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:15,708
Second, I put way more into this
place than I could possibly afford.

251
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:18,590
And I don't want my shit getting
destroyed, capisce?

252
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,106
Let's go.

253
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:23,590
Quit whinging, you pussy.

254
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,864
You're boxing my cutlery after this.

255
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,947
You really think
that was the only print?

256
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:33,036
My spanish isn't great, but I believe
that's what the editor was saying.

257
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:35,479
So what are our options
if we don't find him?

258
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,030
- We get a new editor, start over.
- That could take months.

259
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:40,857
That's why we got to find him.
This is it right here.

260
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,509
- Hello, Kat.
- Hey, Vince.

261
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,818
- E.
- How are you?

262
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:56,348
Billy's ma is staying with us,
so as good as I can be.

263
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,671
Close the door,
there's a chill coming through.

264
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:00,663
It's 80° out.

265
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,855
She's always complaining.

266
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,857
What did you just say
about me, you little slut?

267
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:08,227
Hey, this is my house. Don't
fucking talk to me that way, bitch!

268
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:10,560
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

269
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:12,050
My god.

270
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:15,476
Man, I'm sorry.
The woman is crazy, you know?

271
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:18,337
So, what's going on with you guys?
Everything okay?

272
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,772
Yeah, we're looking for Billy.

273
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,799
Wasn't he gonna meet
you guys for the screening?

274
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,975
Yeah, he was. But he left
and he took the movie with him.

275
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,743
I don't know where he is.

276
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:29,175
Though he was a little down
when he left here this morning.

277
00:12:29,337 --> 00:12:31,783
He was? We spoke to him last night,
he sounded great.

278
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,828
Yeah, he screened the movie
last night for me and his mother

279
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:36,284
and I think it soured him.

280
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:38,475
- You saw the movie?
- Oh yeah, a bunch of times.

281
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,943
Was it good?

282
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:41,927
Oh, I can't say.

283
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:44,342
- You can't say if it was good?
- I can't say anything.

284
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,202
Billy would kill me if I said anything,

285
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:48,710
and you know,
I'd never betray Billy that way.

286
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:50,435
So why was he so down this morning?

287
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:52,290
Because of what she said,
fucking cooz.

288
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:53,773
She didn't like it.

289
00:12:56,771 --> 00:12:57,931
That's him.

290
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,714
Hey baby, where are you?

291
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,945
Vince and E are, like, freaking out.

292
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,922
No, I didn't call them, baby.

293
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,589
Where are you?
Calm down.

294
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:12,729
He hung up.
He's drunk.

295
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:15,670
He said he's at the only place
where people really love him.

296
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:17,888
Any idea where that might be?

297
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:19,560
Yeah, the body shop, probably.

298
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:22,835
- Thanks, Kat.
- See you, Kat.

299
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,254
We'll see you later.

300
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:29,675
- Hey, Frida.
- Yeah, he's in with someone.

301
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,677
Oh, it's fine.
I'll tell him it's fine.

302
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:36,647
Your office said
you didn't want to see me.

303
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:38,317
I just saw you for
a cleaning last week.

304
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,619
- No, it's not for my teeth.
- Oh no, what then?

305
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,915
They've giving Jonah
a hard time over at school.

306
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:44,657
Hard time, huh?

307
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,728
He hit a kid with a ruler
at his evaluation.

308
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,616
Now they're telling me
he may not get in.

309
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,953
I see.

310
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:52,731
You know, you're on the board
and I need help.

311
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,267
I really...
really can't, Ari.

312
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,002
What do you mean, you can't?

313
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:59,200
I can't even talk about this, Ari.

314
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,774
Talk abo what?
You already know something about this?

315
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,979
I'm with a patient.

316
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:07,656
I'm the guy that got Lindsay Lohan
to screen <i>Mean Girls</i> at the school

317
00:14:07,737 --> 00:14:08,948
when you begged.

318
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,525
I'm the guy that got Lil' Bow
at your daughter's bat mitzvah.

319
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,451
I'm the guy that knows
you got a little skank

320
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,150
you keep on the wilshire corridor.

321
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:16,455
This stays here.

322
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:18,097
What are you not telling me?

323
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:24,001
Look, I got two more kids
that I got to get into school.

324
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:26,320
Being on the board alone
does not guarantee that.

325
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,634
You need to talk
to the headmaster about this.

326
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,066
About what?

327
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,131
Goodbye.

328
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:36,397
The ruler incident
is not your son's only problem.

329
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,326
- What are you talking about?
- Talk to Andrew Preston.

330
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,581
Please, I cannot say
anything more... I am sorry...

331
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,155
- But...
- I am sorry.

332
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:48,392
Hope you had a nice nap, Turtle.

333
00:14:48,802 --> 00:14:51,627
What's the problem? You look like
you got it all under control.

334
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:53,569
I gotta get rest
if we're gonna go all night.

335
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:54,782
All night?

336
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,682
- Let's hope so.
- Whatever.

337
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:58,677
Just get over here
and give me a hand with this.

338
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,430
You're taking down the light fixture?

339
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:03,247
It's a chandelier, and yes,
I don't want anyone swinging from it.

340
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:06,057
- You got it at Ikea.
- Whatever, just grab it.

341
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:08,149
Hold on, I got to take a piss.

342
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,677
6-2-4-9-8-7.

343
00:15:11,723 --> 00:15:13,979
6-2-4-9-8-7.

344
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,430
It's the combo.

345
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,750
Are you fucking serious?

346
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:23,179
Deadly serious, Turtle.

347
00:15:23,265 --> 00:15:24,667
You are ruining this party.

348
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:27,040
By stopping 200 people
from shitting on my toilet?

349
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:29,980
- I don't think I'm ruining anything.
- Who shits at a party?

350
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,426
Well, even just piss.

351
00:15:31,507 --> 00:15:33,718
What do drunk people do?
They piss and they miss.

352
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:36,738
That's imported Italian
limestone in there.

353
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:38,815
It's porous and it's not
getting pissed on.

354
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:41,323
So where is everyone supposed to go?
Off the balcony?

355
00:15:41,404 --> 00:15:43,427
Don't be retarded.
I got porta potties coming.

356
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,137
You do not.

357
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:48,076
I do too. In fact,
they should be here any minute.

358
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,400
- So why don't you hold it?
- Fuck that!

359
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:51,910
I'm not holding shit.

360
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:53,716
Do you remember the combo?

361
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:58,065
I will piss all over your plasma.
I swear to god.

362
00:15:59,744 --> 00:16:01,712
6-2-4-9-8-7.

363
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,411
And wash your hands thoroughly.

364
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:04,948
We got to wrap up my frette linens.

365
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:06,928
Let's just do this thing
at Vince's hotel.

366
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:08,919
Turtle, it's my baby bro's party

367
00:16:09,026 --> 00:16:10,348
And I'm hosting it.

368
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:12,775
Do you really think I would
not let it be off the hook?

369
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:14,576
Now stop it.
It's gonna be perfect.

370
00:16:15,654 --> 00:16:18,890
30 more minutes,
this place will be indestructible.

371
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:22,733
Why are you worried
about what his mother says?

372
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,351
'cause she's the only one who's seen it.

373
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:25,855
She hated <i>Queens boulevard</i>.

374
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:27,662
- That's true.
- So relax.

375
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,659
- Marvin.
- Deep breath.

376
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,647
It's your underappreciated
money manager, Eric.

377
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,138
We appreciate you, Marvin.

378
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:41,754
Then how come you don't
listen to a fucking word I say?

379
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,075
Will you stop yelling at me?

380
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:45,046
<i>$1200 a night on a hotel suite...</i>

381
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:46,664
Are you out of your fucking mind?

382
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:48,660
Relax. It only temporary.

383
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,970
<i>Temporary?
Yeah, I'll say it'semporary.</i>

384
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,104
Till they throw you out on your ass!

385
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:55,208
You guys have no money!

386
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:57,375
<i>Why do you think I told you
to get back from Italy?</i>

387
00:16:57,422 --> 00:16:58,429
- I know.
- <i>Hey, listen.</i>

388
00:16:58,478 --> 00:17:00,986
This is not conservative Marvin talking.

389
00:17:01,268 --> 00:17:05,852
This is you-are-really-
and-truly-broke Marvin talking.

390
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:09,465
Living on Vince's black card is insane.

391
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:11,877
- I know.
- So does Ari have a job?

392
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,657
We got to wait till we see the movie.

393
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:15,611
- Did you see it?
- We're seeing it today.

394
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:16,744
- There he is.
- <i>When?</i>

395
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:18,524
- Right now.
- Call me when it's over...

396
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:24,978
Hey, Vince. I didn't know
you were back in town.

397
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:26,300
- Hey.
- No call?

398
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,566
Sorry, Mia.

399
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,179
- I mean, this is just silly.
- Fucking guy.

400
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,202
Well, do you think it's his reading?

401
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:37,112
I know it is.
We don't do enough of it.

402
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,269
- Well I try.
- A little less <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>,

403
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:41,130
a little more
<i>Good Night Moon</i>, perhaps.

404
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:43,394
- You're blaming me?
- No, I'm blaming me

405
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:46,342
who comes home with 40 scripts
a night after working a full day.

406
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:48,418
Hey, you know what?
I'll read one of those to him.

407
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:50,531
Tonight I got <i>Saw IV</i>. He'll love it.

408
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,257
Baby, don't worry.

409
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,010
I will save the day as usual.

410
00:17:54,118 --> 00:17:56,801
Excuse me, sir. Cell phones
are not permitted on school grounds.

411
00:17:56,882 --> 00:17:58,905
Let me call you back.
Andrew Preston?

412
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:02,009
- Ari gold.
- Just the man I was looking for.

413
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:03,893
Sorry about the phone...
business call.

414
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:05,484
It is a Wednesday after all.

415
00:18:06,536 --> 00:18:08,423
Well, what can I do for you, Mr. Gold?

416
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:11,039
I'm sorry to bother you.

417
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,955
It's just that I had a meeting
with your executive assistant today.

418
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:15,141
And...

419
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:17,326
Look, I understand that
the evaluation for my son

420
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,933
didn't go as well as expected,

421
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:21,683
But I need to assure you
that my wife and I

422
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:24,056
are committed to doing whatever it takes

423
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:25,812
to bring our son up to speed.

424
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:28,275
Perhaps he is a little behind
on his reading

425
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:30,297
but I mean, hey,
he's not even six yet.

426
00:18:30,405 --> 00:18:32,346
Okay? You can't really
judge him on his reading.

427
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:35,637
At six I was dyslexic. You would have
thrown me out in the cold.

428
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:37,983
Look at me now.
I'm like the poster boy for this place.

429
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,736
- It's not his reading.
- What is it then?

430
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:41,398
His rhyming,
his fine motor skills?

431
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:42,894
- It's none of that.
- What is it?

432
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:45,348
I can't discuss it until
the process is complete.

433
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:47,074
- You understand.
- Actually I don't.

434
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:53,687
Mr. Preston, I have spent over $200,000
in tuition over the past eight years,

435
00:18:53,822 --> 00:18:55,478
another 50 or so in donations.

436
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:57,743
My wife has served on
50 different committees.

437
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:00,846
All right, that's two less days a week
she gets to Barry's boot camp.

438
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:04,486
She sacrifices her body; obviously
a sacrifice that I make as well,

439
00:19:04,594 --> 00:19:05,871
All for the good of this school.

440
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:09,431
Now, why don't you tell me what type
of new donation I have to make

441
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:11,414
to ensure that I never
have to think about

442
00:19:11,548 --> 00:19:14,137
any type of limitations
you think my son has.

443
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:15,668
Look, Mr. Gold, the thing is...

444
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:17,556
- $20,000.
- Mr. Gold.

445
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,201
- $30,000!
- Mr. Gold...

446
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:20,852
It is not your son.

447
00:19:22,442 --> 00:19:23,683
It is his father:

448
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:27,466
A cell phone on your ear every time
I see you walk through these halls;

449
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:29,447
A foul mouth on the soccer field

450
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:31,388
every time I see you
root for your daughter.

451
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:34,766
This school has simply decided that
your daughter has only four years left.

452
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:38,163
But if we admit your son, that means
more than a decade left with you.

453
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:40,466
Good day.

454
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:54,877
Daddy.

455
00:19:54,978 --> 00:19:57,346
- Get your stuff, sweetheart.
- Everything okay, mr. Gold?

456
00:19:58,387 --> 00:19:59,412
What's going on, daddy?

457
00:19:59,495 --> 00:20:01,356
Nothing, you just
no longer go to school here.

458
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:02,650
What?

459
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,999
Don't be afraid to use a coaster, pal.

460
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:24,777
Hey asshole!
There's nothing in the sub-zero.

461
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:27,195
There's no need to even open it.

462
00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:29,020
Fucking animals.

463
00:20:29,846 --> 00:20:30,920
So is it like the movies?

464
00:20:30,974 --> 00:20:34,212
Where the girls make you do all sorts
of crazy things to get into a sorority?

465
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:37,852
Oh yeah. They didn't let us sleep
for 24 hours on initiation night.

466
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,408
No, I meant like crazy sexual things.

467
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:43,514
We can sell my car.

468
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:45,788
No, it's important
to keep up appearances.

469
00:20:45,949 --> 00:20:47,487
Great.
'cause I love that car.

470
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:50,075
We are all good.

471
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:51,859
We know the movie's great.
We were there.

472
00:20:51,913 --> 00:20:54,475
- Yeah, we were.
- How was your day? Mine sucked

473
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:56,726
and no one called me all day.
Did you see the movie?

474
00:20:57,344 --> 00:20:59,103
- I'm gonna call Walsh again.
- What?

475
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,853
- Is there a problem?
- Hey, shoes off, Ari!

476
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:03,574
Hey, fuck you, Drama!

477
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:06,897
Hey Billy.
It's E.

478
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:09,288
<i>Look, I'm calling for Vince.</i>

479
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:10,993
<i>I know you hate me, Billy.</i>

480
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:14,440
Vince put his entire career on the line
for this movie and for you...

481
00:21:14,657 --> 00:21:16,693
And all of his money.
He's got none.

482
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,034
And he can't get a job
until people see this.

483
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:22,661
<i>So I'm not asking anything for me,
but for Vince.</i>

484
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:25,250
<i>What does Vince
have to do to see this movie?</i>

485
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:30,315
He has to be gentle, suit.

486
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:39,673
- Just calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

487
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:42,551
Someone's in my bathroom and
I want to know how they got in there.

488
00:21:43,374 --> 00:21:45,087
- Don't look at me.
- Don't look at you?

489
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:47,399
That's a nickel-plated master lock

490
00:21:47,536 --> 00:21:49,012
With hardened steel shackles.

491
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,385
It's impossible to get in there
without a combo!

492
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:53,287
Maybe David Copperfield is in there.

493
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,127
Oh, that's funny.

494
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:06,653
She promised to show me her tits.

495
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:09,363
Fucking sellout.

496
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:11,825
What's the problem, Johnny?

497
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,790
No problem, bro.
Having the time of my life.

498
00:22:13,844 --> 00:22:16,251
- You having a good time?
- Great time, great time.

499
00:22:16,352 --> 00:22:18,358
- Listen, we're gonna take off.
- You leaving?

500
00:22:18,466 --> 00:22:20,896
Yeah, Walsh promised
to show us the movie right now.

501
00:22:21,014 --> 00:22:23,258
I don't want him to change his mind...
you understand?

502
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,433
I understand, bro.

503
00:22:24,487 --> 00:22:26,213
Have a good time.
Good luck, good luck.

504
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:28,532
- See you guys later.
- All right. See you later, buddy.

505
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:30,233
Bye-bye now.
I'll see you guys.

506
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:32,417
Bye, you guys.
Bye, bye.

507
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:37,831
Everyone!

508
00:22:38,563 --> 00:22:40,127
I have an announcement to make!

509
00:22:41,155 --> 00:22:42,530
Get the fuck out.

510
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:48,024
No, I'm serious.
The party's over. Get the fuck out!

511
00:22:48,562 --> 00:22:50,233
And head over to my house!

512
00:22:50,322 --> 00:22:52,372
After-party
at Vinnie Chase's hotel room!

513
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:06,309
No words necessary.

514
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,039
Roll it, Raul.
Enjoy.

515
00:23:10,937 --> 00:23:12,582
I'll be throwing up in the alley.

516
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:43,474
I mean, a person
is only as good as their word.

517
00:23:43,771 --> 00:23:46,419
I mean, without that
we'd just be animals.

518
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,081
Fine.

519
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:50,308
You happy?

520
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:52,876
Sadly, I'm very happy.

521
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:54,797
Anybody seen Drama?

522
00:23:54,984 --> 00:23:56,737
Excuse me, excuse me.
Get out of the way.

523
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,675
... picture.
It's a little something...

524
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:02,457
Someone did something
really horrible in the bathroom.

525
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,989
What do you want me to do about it, bro?

526
00:24:06,837 --> 00:24:08,671
Hey, Lloyd, nice sweater, baby.

527
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:11,174
- What's up, Drama?
- How are you, pal?

528
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:12,536
Good, man.
Honey, hold this.

529
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:19,435
Hysterical.

530
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,211
Please say something.

531
00:24:51,515 --> 00:24:52,890
Ah... I'm blown away, Billy.

532
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:55,648
Oh you!

533
00:24:58,749 --> 00:24:59,882
Suit?

534
00:25:00,116 --> 00:25:02,355
- Great job, Billy.
- God, you little...!

535
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:17,384
So we're on the same page, right?

536
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:19,869
- You were just being nice to Billy.
- What do you mean?

537
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,707
You didn't really
like the movie, did you?

538
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:23,459
I thought it was amazing.
You didn't?

539
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,743
I thought it sucked.

540
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,145
- Really?
- Really.

541
00:25:29,245 --> 00:25:30,672
Hey, what's up, Turtle?

542
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:34,663
Great, no,
that's fucking awesome.

543
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:37,873
- What happened?
- They had an after-party at the hotel.

544
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:40,516
Anthony Michael hall pissed off
the balcony, we got thrown out.

545
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:42,440
- Nice.
- So what do you want to do?

546
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:45,327
We'll crash at Johnny's tonight.
So you really didn't like it?

547
00:25:45,516 --> 00:25:46,945
I really didn't.
