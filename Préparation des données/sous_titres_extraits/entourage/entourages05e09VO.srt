00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:16,571
Rise and shine,
morning glories.

4
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:18,404
First day of production.

5
00:02:19,783 --> 00:02:20,788
Wake up!

6
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:24,814
Wake up.
Baby bro starts shooting today.

7
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:26,540
We all need to be up
to support him.

8
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,910
Hell, I'm up!

9
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:32,206
You are now, son.
Let's go, manager.

10
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:35,416
Your number-one client
starts shooting today.

11
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:37,470
- I don't think you want to Miss it.
- Jesus.

12
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,196
Baby bro.
Baby bro.

13
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:40,658
Yeah, Johnny.

14
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:43,782
How'd you get down here?

15
00:02:43,902 --> 00:02:45,833
I've been up for hours.
You blew right past me.

16
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:47,239
- Really?
- Yup.

17
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:50,256
- Ready for work today?
- Getting there.

18
00:02:50,657 --> 00:02:52,801
You want me to make you
anything special for breakfast?

19
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:54,861
I'm okay.
I'm not really hungry.

20
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,679
Not hungry?

21
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:06,709
Hopefully it's just
first day jitters, bro.

22
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:08,599
Leave him alone.
He's fine.

23
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:11,440
He barely slept last night,
now he doesn't want to eat.

24
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,671
He's not fine.

25
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,876
- Here, drink a powerade, bro.
- No thanks.

26
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,424
- Get your electrolytes up.
- No thank you.

27
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:22,705
This is not the best way to start
the most important job of your career.

28
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:25,072
- You trying to freak him out?
- I'm trying to calm him.

29
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:26,907
You're not.
You're making us all crazy.

30
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:29,626
He's not getting crazy.
Vince ain't like us.

31
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:31,252
He's cool as ice, right?

32
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:33,133
Actually,
I am a bit nervous.

33
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:36,203
- God damn it, I knew it.
- Will you shut up, please?

34
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:38,638
- You shut up.
- What's the problem?

35
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,100
I don't know. I just feel a bit off.
I haven't been on a set in over a year.

36
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:44,375
I's like riding a bike.
You just do what you do.

37
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:46,771
Verner hasn't had a second
to talk to me about my character.

38
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:48,535
Can you even understand that guy?

39
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:50,499
Sounds like a cat
with a german hairball.

40
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:52,645
The guy's won
two foreign academy awards.

41
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,225
He's a really good director.

42
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:56,417
- So this is all good?
- It's all good.

43
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:59,229
- What's your first scene?
- Entering the brush with Jason Patric.

44
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:00,818
Nice.
I like Jason Patric.

45
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:04,615
When he was doing <i>Rush</i> he stuck
real needles in his arm to prep.

46
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:07,917
That's what inspired me to do real coke
when I did the Menendez brothers movie.

47
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:12,248
- Weren't you an extra on that?
- So? Still kept it real like J.P. does.

48
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:14,811
- Now you're freaking me out.
- Sorry, bro.

49
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:17,652
Don't worry about it. It's gonna be
like all the other movies you've done.

50
00:04:17,772 --> 00:04:20,274
- Only a little bit bigger.
- <i>11 and 15, fire.</i>

51
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:24,585
Six, seven,

52
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:25,938
fire!

53
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:28,563
- 22, 24.
- Holy shit.

54
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:30,773
Fire 45 to 60.

55
00:04:33,528 --> 00:04:35,194
Okay, number 60, fire.

56
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:38,156
Camera three and two,

57
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:39,660
closer closer.

58
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,447
Okay, all choppers,
now follow me.

59
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:46,118
This is gonna be sick.

60
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:52,472
Any word from the forest?

61
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,609
Vince got his start gift
and he says thank you.

62
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,564
Great.
What did I get him?

63
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:58,967
A sea salt scrub
from Bliss spa.

64
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:01,814
- Are you kidding me?
- Yes, of course I am.

65
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,759
You got him a jet ski
for the lake out there.

66
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,705
Great.
I have amazing taste.

67
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:08,676
Good work, Lloyd.
What's my fortune cookie tell me?

68
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:11,408
That's you've got lunch
with Andrew Klein and that you cannot...

69
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:13,322
- Cancel it.
- You cannot cancel it.

70
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:15,103
I'm the boss.
I can do whatever I want.

71
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:17,042
You've canceled on him
six times already.

72
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:19,974
- You can't cancel again.
- I don't want to sit at lunch with him.

73
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:21,631
- It makes me sad.
- Why?

74
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:23,720
Because it reminds me
of what I might've become.

75
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,848
- A TV lit agent in Encino.
- You did not become that.

76
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:28,930
So sit at lunch with him
and feel good about that.

77
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,911
You sit at lunch with him
knowing you could be him one day

78
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,920
- if you don't listen to me.
- When do I don't?

79
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:36,214
Right now
when I'm telling you to cancel it.

80
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:38,729
Andrew Klein was once
your close friend and mentor.

81
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:42,462
Now go reminisce and enjoy yourself
because I'm not canceling.

82
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:45,062
Maybe put on
a cheaper watch though

83
00:05:45,182 --> 00:05:46,906
so he doesn't feel too bad.

84
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:53,403
Run down to Geary's
and get me a stainless Rolex.

85
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,593
I know what's in there
waiting for me.

86
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:01,156
And nine other brave souls
knew what was waiting for them.

87
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:03,157
There's no way I cannot go now.

88
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:06,367
Maybe...
try it with a little more emotion, bro.

89
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:08,975
I'm just memorizing,
Johnny, thanks.

90
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,503
Saving it up for in front
of the cameras, right?

91
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:15,323
- Just checking.
- We're ready for you, Mr. Chase.

92
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:19,375
Show time.

93
00:06:23,938 --> 00:06:26,042
You know, you did mess up
that one line, though.

94
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:27,423
- I did?
- Yeah.

95
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:29,328
You said nine other brave souls

96
00:06:29,448 --> 00:06:31,355
as opposed to the eight
other brave souls.

97
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,218
Oh, right.
Obviously.

98
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:35,597
Jesus, when do I mess up lines?

99
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:38,092
Just write the number eight
down on the inside of your palm.

100
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:40,893
This way you can just sneak a peek.
I do that shit all the time.

101
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:43,186
Or, who was number eight
on the basketball team?

102
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:45,413
- You were, Turtle.
- Thank of that.

103
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:47,040
Good tip.

104
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,903
- Vincent.
- Hey, Verner.

105
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:52,063
I thought you were
shortening your hair.

106
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:54,753
- I wasn't told.
- It's fine.

107
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:57,380
Doesn't matter.
You ready to go?

108
00:06:58,283 --> 00:06:59,804
I'd love a minute to discuss

109
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:01,758
what you want me to do
with this character.

110
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:03,653
There's nothing to discuss.
We shoot it.

111
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:06,961
If I don't like it I will tell you.
But I'm sure I will like it. Okay?

112
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:13,628
Verner, is this pack
regulation or what?

113
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:15,601
- Yes, it is.
- Feels light to me.

114
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:18,103
No, it is the correct
weight, Jason.

115
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:20,835
Do you know Vincent Chase?

116
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:23,814
- Not personally. I'm a big fan.
- Yeah, me too.

117
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:26,194
What do you weigh?

118
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:27,803
170.

119
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:31,788
You know, they offered me
that <i>Aquaman 2</i>.

120
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:33,144
Really?

121
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:35,005
Not really.

122
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:38,252
Sequels, water-- come on, my friend.
It's not for me.

123
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,017
Well, me either, I guess.

124
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,636
That's funny.

125
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:44,759
Okay, let's shoot.

126
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:48,195
- Aren't we gonna rehearse first?
- No, we shoot the rehearsal.

127
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:49,319
Love that!

128
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:51,629
- Break a leg, bro.
- Knock 'em dead.

129
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:53,059
Cue the fire!

130
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:03,494
The fire's coming from the west.

131
00:08:03,614 --> 00:08:05,367
The west winds are blowing
out of control.

132
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:08,825
- We'll have to bring in more men, sir.
- There are no more men to bring in.

133
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,705
You know what's waiting
in there for you.

134
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:17,553
And eight other brave souls
knew what was waiting for them.

135
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:19,486
There's no way you can't go now.

136
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:21,322
- That's Vince's line.
- Cut!

137
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,377
Perfect, let's move on.

138
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,367
- One take?
- Yes!

139
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:27,476
Love that!

140
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:47,106
There he is.

141
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:48,906
Come here.

142
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,346
- How are you, Andrew?
- Pretty good. Pretty good.

143
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:53,369
God, you look great.

144
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,303
Thank you.
Try to keep healthy.

145
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:57,207
- You know.
- Yeah, sure.

146
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:01,002
- Should we sit?
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

147
00:09:01,577 --> 00:09:03,686
These fuckers.
They're not honoring my reservation.

148
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:05,985
So they're saying a table
is gonna take about 30 minutes.

149
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:08,258
So I thought we'd just eat
at the bar, if that's okay.

150
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:09,601
Bar is great.

151
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:14,141
Barkeeper, can I have another
mccallum 18 neat for my buddy here?

152
00:09:14,415 --> 00:09:16,159
You're still drinking
scotch, I assume?

153
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,059
Not usually for lunch. But...

154
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,934
it's a special occasion.

155
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:21,962
It's been a long time.

156
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:26,939
I remember the last time
I had a drink with you

157
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:28,222
I ended up

158
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,615
covering your boss' phones

159
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:33,138
while you fucked
that cocktail waitress

160
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:35,332
you snuck into the mailroom.
Remember that?

161
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:37,880
I could not believe the sounds
coming out of that room.

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,790
Well, you know what?
She did a nice job.

163
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:42,105
Did she?

164
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:44,292
I'm so happy for you,
believe me.

165
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:46,592
You almost got me fired.
You remember that?

166
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:49,884
You accidentally dropped that
conference call with John ritter.

167
00:09:50,044 --> 00:09:51,761
- No, it was John Goodman.
- Was it?

168
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:53,461
And I didn't feel badly at all.

169
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:55,305
I figured maybe
I was doing you a favor.

170
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:57,031
I love it.
Come here, you dick.

171
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:01,229
- Oh, man.
- We had some good times.

172
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,772
Too many.

173
00:10:02,932 --> 00:10:05,517
We should not let too much
time pass this time.

174
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:08,423
No, for sure we shouldn't.

175
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:11,364
What's wrong?
You all right?

176
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:12,538
It's just...

177
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:16,176
This wasn't just a friendly call.

178
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:19,286
Oh no?

179
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,774
- How was lunch?
- Pricey.

180
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:28,760
- In Encino?
- He needs a loan, Lloyd.

181
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,212
Half a mil.

182
00:10:30,332 --> 00:10:32,723
Double oy. Well, you don't
have to give it to him.

183
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:35,216
Yes I do.
Andy and I were once brothers.

184
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:37,849
A twist of fate turned
one of us into gold

185
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:39,630
and one of us into,
well, a broke,

186
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,911
desperate,
begging-for-money cocksucker.

187
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:46,125
- What are those?
- His books. Company books.

188
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,428
He gave them to me to prove
that he could pay me back.

189
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:51,052
What am I doing? You Asian,
are supposed to be good with numbers.

190
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,729
Figure out if he has any shot
of paying me back.

191
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:56,085
Because if he doesn't,
you will!

192
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:02,910
- Maybe it was a mistake.
- Maybe.

193
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,663
Seems like an odd mistake.

194
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:06,444
The guy does a movie
every five years.

195
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:09,204
Maybe he's trying to make up
for it by saying extra words.

196
00:11:09,324 --> 00:11:11,362
- You got to talk to him.
- What am I gonna say?

197
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:14,712
Say, "Hey, Jason, you got a literacy
problem or did you just steal my lines?"

198
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:17,388
- What if he says I did?
- We may have to get tough with him.

199
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:21,392
I hear he's like
a fifth-degree black belt.

200
00:11:21,936 --> 00:11:24,146
I'll get tough.
I'm just saying the guy's intense.

201
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,939
All right, relax. No one's getting
tough. I'm sure it was an accident.

202
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:28,225
A bad accident.

203
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:32,391
It was a major moment for my character
to say I'm man enough to go into.

204
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:35,489
- And now I basically bail on it.
- Why didn't the director say anything?

205
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,659
Why didn't anybody say anything?
The script supervisor? Nobody.

206
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,436
'cause it's Jason Patric
and everyone's scared of him.

207
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:43,638
But Turtle's right.
You got to nip this in the bud.

208
00:11:43,758 --> 00:11:46,107
That's how a star
marks his territory.

209
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:48,576
Andrew Shue did the same
thing to me on <i>Melrose</i>.

210
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:51,153
- How'd you stop him?
- I banged his girl.

211
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:54,085
- What did that do?
- I don't know, but she was booming.

212
00:11:55,287 --> 00:11:56,904
I'm gonna go talk to him.

213
00:11:57,129 --> 00:11:58,486
- Right behind you.
- Alone.

214
00:11:58,606 --> 00:11:59,790
All right. Go get him.

215
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,184
Remind him he got
molested in <i>Sleepers</i>.

216
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:04,533
That'll throw him off balance.

217
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:10,358
What?

218
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:12,360
Yeah, Jason, it's Vince.

219
00:12:14,722 --> 00:12:15,747
Come in.

220
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:24,014
Everything okay?

221
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:27,375
I just wanted to talk
about the scene.

222
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:30,101
Thank you.
I feel good about it.

223
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:32,687
How do you feel you did?

224
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:34,708
I felt good.
I just--

225
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:37,001
- Good.
- I thought you were pretty good too.

226
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,618
- Thank you.
- I did.

227
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:40,415
- So I--
- You want a protein shake?

228
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:43,115
You should have a protein shake.
Juice, get him a shake.

229
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:44,767
Just give him the pads.

230
00:12:47,153 --> 00:12:49,153
- So it's about the--
- Put 'em on.

231
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:52,316
I just wanted to talk
to you about the lines.

232
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:53,928
Good ones, aren't they?

233
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:55,528
A lot of 'em.
Come on.

234
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,830
So if we--
It's really hot in here.

235
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:07,470
Isn't it?

236
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:10,182
You know how hot it can get
when wood combusts, don't you?

237
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,771
3000°.

238
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:13,555
Hot.

239
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:18,199
I like to jack up the heat, acclimate
my body a little bit, you know?

240
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:19,824
I'm good.

241
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:23,760
- So--
- Some life we're living, isn't it?

242
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:26,937
Some life.

243
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:29,304
I'm gonna do some crunches.

244
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,147
You pussed out.

245
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:46,867
Take longer, Lloyd. Seriously.

246
00:13:46,987 --> 00:13:49,664
- I'm almost finished.
- How big of a loser is he?

247
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:51,336
Andrew Klein is no loser.

248
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,283
- He's a big winner.
- How so?

249
00:13:53,557 --> 00:13:57,029
It looks like he just has a little cash
flow problem brought on by the strike.

250
00:13:57,248 --> 00:13:59,641
- He quietly has a very nice business.
- Really?

251
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:01,153
Unless these books are cooked,

252
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,318
I think he pays you back
in full in 90 days.

253
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,638
Did you know that he has over
50 writers staffed on tv shows?

254
00:14:07,758 --> 00:14:09,830
- That's unbelievable.
- He's an anonymous star,

255
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,093
wrongly judged
by the location of his office.

256
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:13,865
Jesus,
he made some money last year.

257
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:15,924
And paid some out.
Look what his assistant made.

258
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:17,916
You want to work in the valley?

259
00:14:19,255 --> 00:14:22,023
You know, Andrew Klein was me
when we were younger.

260
00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:26,202
We were the same.
Rising stars.

261
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:28,913
Both made lots of money.
Both got tons of pussy.

262
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:31,540
- What happened?
- We both married too young.

263
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,048
I meant with work.

264
00:14:33,644 --> 00:14:37,066
When Terrance and Jim Oliver split,
they ended up dividing up the agency.

265
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:39,465
I went with Terrance,
Andrew went with Jim.

266
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:42,317
Jim ended up ripping off
all of his clients

267
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:45,029
and his employees.
And andrew...

268
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:48,623
Never made it back
to the big time again.

269
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:50,044
That's sad.

270
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:54,462
Get him on the phone.
I want to have drinks tonight.

271
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:57,849
- You're gonna give him the loan?
- I'm gonna do a lot more than that.

272
00:14:57,969 --> 00:14:59,767
I'm gonna give him a life.

273
00:14:59,972 --> 00:15:02,218
Maybe someday
you'll give me one too.

274
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,949
Ari Gold calling for Andrew Klein.

275
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:09,453
Verner.

276
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:11,441
This?

277
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:13,457
Okay, no problem.

278
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:18,483
All right, I used to have
a chair with my name on it.

279
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:21,340
Oh, Jason, take mine.
Take mine.

280
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,598
Juice, go get my chair.

281
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:26,215
- Where?
- Just find it.

282
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,900
What are you smiling about?

283
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:36,828
- Jesus.
- I love it.

284
00:15:36,948 --> 00:15:39,316
I want everybody
on this set to be aware

285
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:42,349
that Mr. Jason Patric's
seat back is missing.

286
00:15:42,678 --> 00:15:44,738
I know you probably think
that this will be

287
00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:47,404
a good souvenir to show
your children someday,

288
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:50,327
but to me it's a severe
breach of trust.

289
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:53,690
I want you to return it immediately
and everything will be forgotten.

290
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,485
If not and you're found out later,

291
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:58,711
you will be treated as harshly

292
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:00,752
as humanly possible.

293
00:16:04,852 --> 00:16:07,140
- Should I give it back?
- No way.

294
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,414
He just said if you give
it back now he's not gonna--

295
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:11,368
He's German,
don't trust him.

296
00:16:13,428 --> 00:16:14,964
Hide it in Jason's trailer.

297
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,271
- Hey, how's it going?
- Everything's good with us.

298
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:19,614
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm feeling good.

299
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:21,275
Okay, people.
Let's shoot.

300
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,219
You drink the shake?

301
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,187
- Uh, yeah, I--
- Fish oil in there.

302
00:16:26,307 --> 00:16:27,326
Focus.

303
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:30,389
- You ready to make history?
- Absolutely.

304
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:31,776
Let's do it.

305
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:33,683
Come on.

306
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,882
Got to push the defensive line!

307
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:50,945
Sir.

308
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:52,306
Sir, Malone is down

309
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:54,531
I can't do it.

310
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:56,224
I keep thinking about Janine.

311
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:58,152
What kind of father would I be?

312
00:16:58,591 --> 00:16:59,954
You'll be fine.

313
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:02,355
We're going in together
and I will have your back.

314
00:17:02,475 --> 00:17:04,643
- I'm sorry, can we take it back?
- What?

315
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:06,737
- That's his line again.
- This guy's a klepto.

316
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:08,780
- Don't cut.
- I'm really sorry.

317
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:11,681
It threw me a little when you
said the "you'll be fine" line.

318
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:13,571
- I thought it was me.
- Keep rolling.

319
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:16,830
- Just go back.
- Okay, from "what kind of father?"

320
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:18,392
Action!

321
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:21,794
What kind of father would I be?

322
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:23,603
- You'll--
- You'll be fine.

323
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:26,452
We're going in together
and I will have your back.

324
00:17:26,572 --> 00:17:28,781
- This is nuts.
- Shue all over again.

325
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:30,941
And cut.
Thank you, great.

326
00:17:31,061 --> 00:17:32,174
Take five.

327
00:17:35,352 --> 00:17:37,344
I'm not gonna end up
saying a word in this movie.

328
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:39,118
You want me to go talk to Verner?

329
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:41,614
I'll do it.

330
00:17:43,976 --> 00:17:46,318
- So how is Marlo doing?
- Well she's the same.

331
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,299
Older, flabbier.

332
00:17:49,095 --> 00:17:51,714
Didn't we swear that
we wouldn't keep the women past 45?

333
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:54,255
My new year's resolution
since 1996.

334
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,869
But it never took.

335
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:57,913
- How are the kids?
- Great.

336
00:17:58,582 --> 00:17:59,924
No hollywood for them.

337
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:02,951
- God is on my side.
- You really don't love this town, huh?

338
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,047
I'm not really in this town.
I'm a subspecies all my own.

339
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:08,656
And you like tt?

340
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,204
Yeah. It's been okay for me.

341
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,410
Really?

342
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:15,009
What are you doing to me?

343
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:17,107
- Are you gonna make me beg?
- No.

344
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:19,560
Remember when you wanted
to buy your first car out here

345
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,491
who cosigned the loan agreement.

346
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:28,897
I don't want to give you the loan.

347
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:33,215
I understand.
No hard feelings.

348
00:18:33,335 --> 00:18:34,992
I want to buy your company.

349
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:38,457
Buy my company?

350
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:43,530
- Why would I want to sell?
- So you can get back

351
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,512
to the place
that you were supposed to be.

352
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:47,546
I'm doing great.
It's just a cash flow problem.

353
00:18:47,706 --> 00:18:50,603
You're like Lebron James
if he was playing in Spain.

354
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:52,247
Sure people know he's good,

355
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:54,960
but no one wants to eat paella
while watching basketball.

356
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,704
I'm not gonna sell my company.

357
00:18:56,824 --> 00:18:58,849
I understand if you don't
want to give me a loan.

358
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:00,791
I want to give you a life--

359
00:19:01,011 --> 00:19:04,353
The life that you and I
were supposed to have together.

360
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:07,856
You'll make more money,
you'll have more responsibility,

361
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:11,017
you'll feel better about yourself.
The loan is yours if you want it.

362
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:13,473
But there's a better
offer on the table.

363
00:19:15,776 --> 00:19:17,034
I need a drink.

364
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:21,038
Waiter, another scotch.

365
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,790
Make it two.
Doubles.

366
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:27,246
Hey, how are you?

367
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,100
- I have pages for Mr. Patric.
- You can leave those with me.

368
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,088
I'll make sure Mr. Patric
gets them as soon as he comes out.

369
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:37,389
Would you hurry up, Drama?

370
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:39,616
Easy does it, Turtle.
Easy does it.

371
00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:42,274
All you had to do was hide
the chair back in there.

372
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,891
Come on.

373
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:49,117
I took the opportunity
to inflict a little damage.

374
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:51,500
- What kind of damage?
- The number two kind.

375
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:55,375
- You took a shit in his trailer?
- And sue me if I forgot to flush.

376
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,734
Are you serious?

377
00:19:57,854 --> 00:20:00,168
Let's just say revenge
is best served

378
00:20:00,288 --> 00:20:02,496
- a la commode.
- Ugh, gross.

379
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,273
Then we have a track
around there.

380
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:08,009
One crane there
and one crane there.

381
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:12,302
First day of shooting,
we popped the cherry.

382
00:20:12,422 --> 00:20:14,083
- So how you feeling?
- I feel good.

383
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:16,226
Good.
I know some actors

384
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:18,171
can be thrown by
my way of working.

385
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,089
You know,
no rehearsals and such.

386
00:20:20,209 --> 00:20:22,291
I totally understand.
Everyone has their process.

387
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:25,084
Yes, it has worked very well
for me in the past.

388
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:27,029
I think that the lack
of preparation

389
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:29,181
gives you a more
natural performance.

390
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:30,816
Well, as long as you're happy.

391
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,198
I'm happy.
But you seem troubled.

392
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,257
What's on your mind?

393
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:39,283
It's just a couple of my lines.

394
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:42,309
Your lines?
You don't like them?

395
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,364
No, actually I really love them.

396
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,100
It's just that Jason
ended up saying them.

397
00:20:47,284 --> 00:20:49,543
- Oh, that.
- You're aware of it?

398
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:51,987
Of course I'm aware of it.
It's my set.

399
00:20:52,107 --> 00:20:53,823
I'm aware of everything
that happens.

400
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:55,522
He's good.
He's good too.

401
00:20:55,642 --> 00:20:56,860
You-- take him away.

402
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,219
- You're not troubled by it?
- No.

403
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:01,876
When I got Jason to agree to do this

404
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:04,261
I knew that I was hiring an actor

405
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:07,192
that was very fiery
and volatile,

406
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:10,309
but also capable
of a brilliant performance.

407
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,050
So what then?

408
00:21:12,598 --> 00:21:14,324
So it means

409
00:21:14,716 --> 00:21:16,743
I have to pick my battles

410
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:19,416
or I might lose them altogether.

411
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:20,869
What about me?

412
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,343
You, Vincent,

413
00:21:22,754 --> 00:21:24,124
you're stable.

414
00:21:25,274 --> 00:21:27,748
I don't have to worry
about losing you, do I?

415
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:30,634
I'm just afraid of losing my character
if he doesn't go into that fire.

416
00:21:30,754 --> 00:21:32,544
- You're not worried?
- I actually think

417
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:34,637
that when we get to that scene
in the third act

418
00:21:34,757 --> 00:21:36,467
where you are overcome with smoke,

419
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,470
I think your turning point
will be much better,

420
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,004
more interesting this way.

421
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:41,621
- Really?
- Really.

422
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,219
So let me keep an eye
on the big picture

423
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:47,055
and you keep an eye on you.

424
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:55,992
How'd it go?

425
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:58,670
I think old Verner's
a bigger pussy than I am.

426
00:21:59,503 --> 00:22:01,281
Someone's got to put a stop to this.

427
00:22:06,547 --> 00:22:07,561
Juice!

428
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,347
Fucking flush.

429
00:22:12,676 --> 00:22:14,753
- Brad Pitt.
- No, that's not true.

430
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,881
- Which part isn't true?
- You never could have signed him.

431
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,137
What are you talking about?
It was 1989.

432
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,131
It was before they even wrote
Thelma and Louise

433
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,734
and you and I were sitting
with him at Nikki Blair's

434
00:22:24,854 --> 00:22:28,069
and you said, and I quote here,
"I don't see it."

435
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:29,849
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

436
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:32,259
- You were with your wife.
- Oh shit.

437
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:33,930
That's right.
He flirted with her.

438
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,581
That's why I said it.

439
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:37,746
- Jesus christ, A&ndrew.
- You're telling me.

440
00:22:37,866 --> 00:22:40,153
I wish he'd fucked her.
Shit, I wish he'd married her.

441
00:22:40,532 --> 00:22:42,797
Honey, can I get a round here?

442
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:44,741
You want another shot at Brad Pitt?

443
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:46,868
That's not what I want anymore.

444
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:48,736
- You're bullshitting me.
- What?

445
00:22:48,856 --> 00:22:51,915
I am my own boss. I come and go
as I please. I answer to no one.

446
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:53,721
You answer to tv hacks.

447
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:57,004
And a glamorous night out is an invite
to the Writer's Guild Awards.

448
00:22:57,164 --> 00:22:59,016
You don't know what
you're talking about.

449
00:22:59,136 --> 00:23:01,123
I know that you repped
Marc Cherry for a decade.

450
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:03,351
It was the decade that
he lived at home with his mom.

451
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:05,973
And I know that as soon as
<i>Desperate Housewives</i> hit number one,

452
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,181
we left you for that schmuck
over at William Morris.

453
00:23:08,341 --> 00:23:10,699
You stick with me
and I swear to you

454
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:12,594
no one will leave you again.

455
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:14,975
I can't even imagine trying to talk

456
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:17,065
- to these people anymore.
- I can.

457
00:23:17,618 --> 00:23:19,860
I can imagine you selling
them the way you sold me.

458
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,750
I mean, do you remember
when I was gonna walk

459
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,349
and go back to Chicago
and become a lawyer?

460
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:28,007
- The speech you gave me?
- It wasn't much of a speech.

461
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:31,959
I just said, "do you really want to
die a loser fucking lawyer in Chicago?"

462
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,583
Do you really want to die
a loser lit agent in the Valley?

463
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:40,855
Why are you really doing this?

464
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,725
Guilt? You feel bad 'cause
I didn't end up where you are?

465
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:47,777
Maybe it would have
turned out this way anyway.

466
00:23:47,897 --> 00:23:49,514
Maybe this was my destiny.

467
00:23:49,674 --> 00:23:51,725
Bullshit.
Destiny brought us here.

468
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:55,103
The fucking cocksucking
writer's strike brought us here.

469
00:23:55,263 --> 00:23:57,592
- Andrew, come on.
- Why do you believe in me?

470
00:23:58,488 --> 00:24:00,442
- Why after all this time?
- Instincts.

471
00:24:01,081 --> 00:24:02,998
I follow my instincts.
That's all I got.

472
00:24:03,118 --> 00:24:06,614
If you follow me I swear to you
it's a game changer.

473
00:24:07,234 --> 00:24:10,385
We were a great team then,
we'll be a great team now.

474
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,873
That head of hair
is too good for the Valley.

475
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,216
I'm telling you.

476
00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:16,249
Come on.

477
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:21,269
Okay okay.

478
00:24:22,036 --> 00:24:23,324
Yeah, let's do it.

479
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,379
Thank you.
Let's do it.

480
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:28,374
I won't let you down.

481
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:33,174
I need a minute.
I'm sorry.

482
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:34,827
All right.

483
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:39,250
Another round.
We're celebrating.

484
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:44,277
What, are you drunk?

485
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:46,372
Drunk on life, Babs.

486
00:24:46,564 --> 00:24:49,282
- What do you want?
- Expansion. It's time.

487
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:51,855
I've been begging you for months.
What have you got?

488
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:55,800
Small literary shop servicing
over 65 working tv writers

489
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,541
with less than five agents.

490
00:24:57,908 --> 00:25:00,558
- I like it.
- Grossed over $5 million last year.

491
00:25:00,678 --> 00:25:03,537
- I really like it. Which company?
- <i>Klein-Kuddler. You heard of them?</i>

492
00:25:03,657 --> 00:25:05,133
Is that Andrew Klein?

493
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:08,503
- No go, the guy's a loser.
- No he's not.

494
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:11,888
I'm not talking about what he makes.
I'm talking about his general essence.

495
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:14,965
We need to project a certain image.

496
00:25:15,322 --> 00:25:17,519
And that washout
doesn't exactly fit the bill.

497
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,938
And what do you project,
menopausal chic?

498
00:25:20,223 --> 00:25:23,316
He's not big agency material.
No go.

499
00:25:23,674 --> 00:25:26,057
I wasn't calling you
for your permission.

500
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:28,280
Read your partnership
agreements then.

501
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,532
Because my permission
is exactly what you need.

502
00:25:37,574 --> 00:25:39,477
- I thought you killed it today.
- Killed it?

503
00:25:39,597 --> 00:25:41,459
I was basically moving scenery.

504
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:43,057
But at least you looked good.

505
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:45,933
You got two big scenes coming up that
he's not in so you can make up for it.

506
00:25:46,053 --> 00:25:48,683
He'll probably jump out of a tree
and steal those lines too.

507
00:25:48,803 --> 00:25:50,558
We got a few more
tricks up our sleeves.

508
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:52,531
Just say the word
and we'll have him in tears.

509
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,222
I appreciate it.
Thanks.

510
00:25:54,342 --> 00:25:55,792
I hate to see you like this.

511
00:25:55,912 --> 00:25:58,018
- I'm sorry.
- I know what might cheer you up.

512
00:25:58,444 --> 00:26:01,146
I saw your favorite, banana cream pie,
over on the buffet table.

513
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:03,353
- I grab you a slice.
- That would be nice, thanks.

514
00:26:03,473 --> 00:26:05,452
Slimy thief approaching at 3:00.

515
00:26:05,572 --> 00:26:07,120
Control yourself, Drama.

516
00:26:08,132 --> 00:26:09,321
Good work, Vince.

517
00:26:09,994 --> 00:26:11,474
- I try.
- See you tomorrow.

518
00:26:11,594 --> 00:26:13,508
Jason, I loved your work in <i>Narc</i>.

519
00:26:13,628 --> 00:26:15,991
Really really
inspirational stuff, man.

520
00:26:16,111 --> 00:26:18,128
- Really? Thanks,
- Take it easy.

521
00:26:18,732 --> 00:26:20,349
What the hell was that?

522
00:26:31,264 --> 00:26:32,761
Get a paper towel, will you?

523
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,035
- Thought you were getting me pie.
- Got you a cookie.

524
00:26:42,155 --> 00:26:43,483
What about the pie?

525
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:45,805
- Jason took it.
- What do you mean?

526
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:48,732
I mean, I waited in line
and when I got to the pie

527
00:26:48,852 --> 00:26:50,608
he swooped in
and took the last piece.

528
00:26:50,728 --> 00:26:52,614
- And you let him?
- He's imposing.

529
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:54,961
That's it.
Hey, Jason.

530
00:26:56,276 --> 00:26:59,020
- What's up, Vince?
- Did you take that pie from Turtle?

531
00:27:00,824 --> 00:27:02,415
Yeah, this guy.
My friend.

532
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:05,026
He's waiting in line for this pie
and you took it.

533
00:27:05,146 --> 00:27:07,170
- I did?
- You kinda did.

534
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:09,516
Oh, I'm sorry
about that, man.

535
00:27:09,636 --> 00:27:12,530
And while we're on the subject, you
kinda took a few of my lines today too.

536
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,761
- Tell him, bro.
- What lines?

537
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:16,360
All of them.

538
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:19,146
I don't seem to be following
where we're going,

539
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:21,256
but there seems to be
a bit of a problem here.

540
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:24,746
The big monologue in the first scene,
advice to malone in the third scene.

541
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:26,514
- Verner gave me those lines.
- Verner?

542
00:27:26,634 --> 00:27:28,354
Verner, our director.

543
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,019
I assumed you knew that.

544
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,338
- Well, I didn't,
- now you do.

545
00:27:33,574 --> 00:27:35,490
So why don't you go
take that up with him?

546
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,546
Because any confusion that there
seems to be has nothing to do with me.

547
00:27:44,324 --> 00:27:48,628
I want to thank you, everybody,
for a fantastic first day.

548
00:27:49,516 --> 00:27:50,588
Auf uns!
