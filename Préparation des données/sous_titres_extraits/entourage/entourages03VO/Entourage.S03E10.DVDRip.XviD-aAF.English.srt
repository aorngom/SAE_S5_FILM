1
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,154
Yo, heads up.

2
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,758
- So?
- So what?

3
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,836
- So how do I look?
- You look OK.

4
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,677
Why are you so dressed up?

5
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,915
You guys are kidding me, right?

6
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,235
What is today?

7
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,635
- What's today?
- What is today?

8
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,831
- Is it your birthday?
- No, it's not my fucking birthday.

9
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,714
I can't believe this. I got my record deal
signing with Sammy Kane.

10
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,399
- Is that today?
- Damn, I forgot all about that.

11
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,192
Good luck, buddy.

12
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,276
Biggest day of my life and you forgot.

13
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,515
You guys really suck.

14
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,439
Come here, Turtle!

15
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,199
Guy's finally breaking his cherry.
Gonna make a buck.

16
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,915
- Don't fuck with the hat.
- How could we forget? Look what we did.

17
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,077
- I made your favourite.
- Raspberry frosting.

18
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,190
I cut the crust off the way you like it.

19
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,310
- Nice!
- I had the truck detailed.

20
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,679
Really?

21
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,234
And I'm gonna be driving you today.

22
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,272
Unbelievable.
What'd you do, Vince?

23
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,118
- I think I've done enough, Turtle.
- True, true.

24
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,196
But it is still payday.

25
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,630
I don't think I'm gonna
be needing that any more, Vin.

26
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,557
- What about parking?
- Maybe a 20?

27
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,157
Thanks, guys. I gotta roll. I do not want
Saigon beating me to this meeting.

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,397
I programmed the GPS.
We'll have you there in no time.

29
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,113
- Let's roll. Thanks again.
- Have a good one.

30
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,195
Later, guys.

31
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,470
It's sad to watch the kids leave the nest.

32
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,512
Now let's talk adult business.
You coming to see Ari?

33
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,835
- No.
- We haven't heard from him in a week.

34
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,475
- It'll make a strong statement if you're there.
- Stronger if I'm not.

35
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,636
I'm gonna grab a couple of books.

36
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,240
- By yourself?
- Can't go to a bookstore by myself?

37
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,115
- You don't drive.
- Yeah, but I do read, E. I do read.

38
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,718
Come on, come on, come on.

39
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,511
Where the fuck is Saigon?

40
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,994
Maybe he got clipped in a drive-by.

41
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,799
- That would suck.
- I'm calling him again.

42
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,516
It's right to voicemail.

43
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,869
Yo, Sai, it's Turtle... again.

44
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,354
Where are you, man?
Call me back.

45
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,075
You know what? Just get to the meeting.
Don't call me back.

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,429
This is so fucked.

47
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,597
All right, Mr Kane's ready for you.
You can come up with me.

48
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,429
- What are you gonna do?
- I have no idea.

49
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,232
Say a prayer.

50
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,315
Always wanted to do
the new Puffy album.

51
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,920
Hey, yeah. I love this town.

52
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,793
- Hey, sorry to keep you waiting, Turtle.
- It's no problem at all.

53
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,029
- So what's going on, Mr Kane?
- Just life. So, where's Saigon?

54
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,313
He's running a little bit late
but he should be here any minute.

55
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,751
- Any minute? It's 10:30.
- Why don't we get started without him?

56
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,588
- Started on what?
- The paperwork, the signatures, all that stuff.

57
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,838
We can get started on that.
Look, you even got this nice pen.

58
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,714
Don't touch the pen, Turtle.
That pen is for artists only.

59
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,513
Gotcha. Sorry.

60
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,278
- What the fuck is going on?
- Nothing.

61
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,151
- Are you trying to fuck me?
- No.

62
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,760
Why are you sweating
like the guy in Midnight Express?

63
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,155
Where is your client, Turtle?

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,592
I have no idea.

65
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,156
You've got till five o'clock to produce him
or the deal goes away.

66
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,515
Hi, Eric. What do you think of the new space?

67
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,198
Fancy. Ari around?

68
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,152
Go on in. He's just going
through fabric books.

69
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,391
- Remember me?
- One never forgets their first love, E.

70
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,237
- Where've you been?
- Right here.

71
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,477
It's tough to leave this paradise.
Come look.

72
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,159
I'm putting in a shower
right here with a steam.

73
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,351
If you promise to drop your towel
I might even let you use it.

74
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,709
Suddenly we're not a priority?

75
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,159
Got a lot of priorities, E.

76
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,716
- Two weeks ago, it was all Vince.
- I sent 20 scripts. He won't read them.

77
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,876
He read them. He didn't like 'em.

78
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,673
When Vince is ready to work,
I will work for him.

79
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,190
You really are a front-running douchebag,
you know that?

80
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,552
Bob Ryan is outside.

81
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,752
He said he will hoist himself
on his own petard if you don't come see him.

82
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,315
I don't know what it means
but it sounds dangerous.

83
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,874
You're not leaving in the middle
of this conversation?

84
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,435
Conversations end after one person
calls the other a douchebag.

85
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,038
You called him a douchebag?

86
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,518
Check out the new Italian marble, E.
I'll be back.

87
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,271
- Who gave Bob the new address?
- Not me.

88
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,030
- Don't spend the whole day reminiscing.
- Don't tell me how to do my job, Barbara.

89
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,594
Well, well, I'd have an easier time

90
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,029
getting a face-to-face
with Osama bin Laden.

91
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,755
- Make an appointment, Bob.
- Appointments are for salesmen, kid.

92
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,233
Come here.

93
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,111
But...

94
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,559
What can I do for you, Bob?

95
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,830
Pay me back for helping you sign Billy Friedkin

96
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,472
when you were barely out of the mailroom.

97
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,751
How many Mrs Beasley's Baskets
will it take to make you smile?

98
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,678
Just throw me a movie star
I can take to the studios.

99
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,952
- You know I'm not leaving until you do.
- I know. I know.

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,878
E! You know Vincent Chase?

101
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,516
I haven't seen a kid that good-looking
since I was that good-looking.

102
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,915
Meet Eric Murphy,
Vincent Chase's manager.

103
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,712
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

104
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,035
This is Bob Ryan. He's a legend.

105
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,674
The guy has almost as many Oscars
as John Williams.

106
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,314
He produced Network, The Sting,

107
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,112
Dog Day Afternoon, many others.

108
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,513
Those are great movies.

109
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,315
If I had a movie better than any of those
that would be perfect for Vincent Chase,

110
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,555
would that be something
you'd be interested in?

111
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,319
- Definitely.
- I'm a matchmaker. I love it.

112
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,157
Have lunch, talk it over.

113
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,509
- My driver's waiting outside.
- Great.

114
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,198
- Come, let's go.
- Thanks, Ari.

115
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,071
Thanks, Ari.

116
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,918
- That was mean.
- To which one of them?

117
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,999
Thanks, man.
Keep the change.

118
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,434
No, Turtle, there were no calls
at the house.

119
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,950
I don't know what the fuck to do.
I don't know where he is.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,549
- I'm sorry, Turtle. Anything I can do?
- No, I'll figure it out.

121
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,512
- Call me if you need me.
- Thanks, Vince.

122
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,790
All right, later.

123
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,830
I'd be careful if I were you.

124
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,830
- Why is that?
- I saw paparazzi out there.

125
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,031
You won't want to get busted
checking out your own picture.

126
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,152
- Good looking-out.
- No problem.

127
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,316
- I thought we were going to The lvy.
- Forget The lvy.

128
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,272
What if I was to tell you
that my chef Raoul Pepefirio

129
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,719
made a steak so delicious

130
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,594
that Cliff Robertson used to come to the house
three times a week to eat it?

131
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,712
Would a steak like that be
something you'd be interested in?

132
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,228
- Yeah, sure. I like steak.
- Great.

133
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,477
And wait till you see my maid Marsha.
Quite the stunner.

134
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,637
Marlon Brando used to come to the house
three times a week

135
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,477
just to stick it in her ass.

136
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,717
And that was before it was fashionable.

137
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,671
- Where is your house, Bob?
- What?

138
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,950
My second time in this neighbourhood
without my nunchucks.

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,515
- I am not happy.
- Oh, you're not happy?

140
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,075
I got 40 grand riding on finding Saigon
in the next four hours.

141
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,749
If I don't, I'm gonna kill myself
by eating all your Propecia pills.

142
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,360
Relax, Turtle. Relax.

143
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,196
Hey, Turtle. How're you doing?

144
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,075
- Not great.
- What's the problem?

145
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,829
Me and Saigon had our big record signing
today and he didn't show.

146
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,158
- I was wondering if he was OK.
- I don't know nothing about that.

147
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,316
About the record signing or if he's OK?

148
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,158
I don't know nothing about nothing.

149
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,634
- He's not home, is he?
- No, he ain't here.

150
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,114
Excuse me.
I got my church group inside

151
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,277
and it's not polite to keep the Lord waiting.

152
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,517
Something here ain't right.

153
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,757
Yeah, no shit, Columbo.
But how does that help me?

154
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,111
What are you doing? Drama!

155
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,757
There's a plasma
the size of a Cadillac.

156
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,870
But I don't hear any gospel music.

157
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,468
What the hell are you boys doing?

158
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,191
Sorry to bother you again, ma'am,
but can I use your phone, please?

159
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,357
- It's a local call. Won't take long.
- OK, hurry it up.

160
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,958
- You making the call or what?
- No.

161
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,914
- I'm all good.
- Good.

162
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,354
Oh, ma'am. I'd like to ask you
one more thing.

163
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,277
You didn't ask me anything.

164
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,835
Do you know anyone staying
at The Standard Hotel?

165
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,997
- What?
- It's on your call log, Mrs Saigon.

166
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,235
What do you have to say about that?

167
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,397
I don't have nothing to say about nothing.

168
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,954
Just as I thought.

169
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,750
What the fuck is going on?

170
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,032
I don't know. But I think
the answer lies at The Standard.

171
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,914
So... do you always work
the bookstores looking for lunch dates?

172
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,918
You tend to find a classier woman
than at the track.

173
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,994
I bet you have lunch with
a different woman every day.

174
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,874
No. Sadly I usually spend my lunches
with my three knucklehead friends.

175
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,077
But it's becoming clear
I should ditch them more often.

176
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,635
Oh, thank you.

177
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,919
Thank you, Alan.

178
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,872
Tell me about this project
you think Vince would be perfect for.

179
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,911
After we digest, Eric.

180
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,076
After we digest.

181
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,032
- So what do you think of this place?
- It's great.

182
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,958
You know,
I paid 140 grand for it in 1967.

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,037
Steve McQueen told me
I was out of my mind.

184
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,389
It's worth 13 million today.

185
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,750
What if I was to tell you
you could buy a place for 140 grand

186
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,473
and some day it would be worth $13 million?

187
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,548
- Is that something you'd be interested in?
- Of course, Bob. Who wouldn't?

188
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,636
There she is.

189
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,750
Marsha, come here.

190
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,394
I want you to say hello to my friend.

191
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,715
She's still got the legs, huh?

192
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,477
I don't see anything
under the name Saigon.

193
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,750
He's a black man about yo high,

194
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,917
probably carrying a Glock.
Do you have a metal detector?

195
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,349
- No, we don't.
- Thanks anyway.

196
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,948
- You really think he's at this hotel?
- I know he is.

197
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,030
- I can feel him.
- Are you auditioning for Medium, jerk-off?

198
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,275
- Whatever. He's here.
- Let's go find him.

199
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,993
- How?
- Come on. This time I got a plan.

200
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,079
- I didn't expect to do this today.
- You needed to go shopping.

201
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,715
I know. But, like, you didn't have
anything better to do?

202
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,512
Nicole, I'm unemployed.

203
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,235
This has been one of the most
fulfilling days I've had in weeks.

204
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,999
Are you coming out?
I want to see you in that dress.

205
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,350
No, I'm embarrassed.

206
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,436
You come in.

207
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,275
It looked bigger on the hanger.

208
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,676
I want to show you this room, Eric.

209
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,870
Sam Peckinpah screened Straw Dogs

210
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,673
for the very first time
here in this room.

211
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,632
Everyone knew he had
a big hit on his hands.

212
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,911
A lot of jealous people
in the house that night, I'll tell you.

213
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,474
- I bet. Bob...
- Everyone thinks it was

214
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,353
Nicholson and Beatty
back in the day,

215
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,756
but it was Dusty Hoffman
that got more pussy than anybody.

216
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,155
And a lot of it right here in this room.

217
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,391
- So tell me about this project.
- Sit.

218
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,874
Sit. Yeah.
Can I get you anything, Eric?

219
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,276
- No, I'm good.
- You know, coffee, tea...

220
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,117
- I'm good.
...liquor, milk?

221
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,879
- Just had a big steak.
- OK.

222
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,639
Hey, I got some great home movies.

223
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,036
How would you like to see
Candy Bergen playing tennis...

224
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,992
in her underwear? Fantastic ass.

225
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,512
Maybe next time, Bob.

226
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,758
Of course. I'm sure you have
a million things to do, a young kid like you.

227
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,554
I was once a young kid like you, Eric.

228
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,111
You don't have a project, do you, Bob?

229
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,515
No, I don't.

230
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,597
But if we sit here and brainstorm
we'll come up with one.

231
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,871
Bob, I got a million things to do.
I gotta get back to the house.

232
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,798
In '68 I locked Dennis Hopper in the bathroom

233
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,593
with nothing but a handful
of mushrooms and bingo,

234
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,278
he came up with Easy Rider.

235
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,588
Unfortunately I couldn't get him out for a week.

236
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,354
When a man nears the end of his life,
you know what he begins to think about?

237
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,312
He thinks about
how he'll be remembered.

238
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,238
I've made 42 movies,
20 of them classics,

239
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,589
six nominations, three statues.

240
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,710
But if I were to drop dead right now,

241
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,876
you know what
I'd be remembered for?

242
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,956
Cutthroat Island.

243
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,075
Stay a little while longer
and talk to me, please, Eric.

244
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,918
OK, Bob.
I just need to use the bathroom.

245
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,231
Oh, yeah. Third door on the right,
right past my Picasso.

246
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,919
Technically it still belongs to Roman,

247
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,396
but what are the chances
of him coming back for it?

248
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,158
Check out the jib arm
on this bad boy, Babs.

249
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,351
That's great. Now if you could only
teach it to sign clients.

250
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,118
Are we not rocking and rolling?

251
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,958
I had a half-a-million-dollar day
for this agency.

252
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,754
In the spirit of competition,
I hope you plan on catching up.

253
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,996
Here's my million-dollar call right now.
Excuse me.

254
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,158
- Called to apologise, E?
- This guy's got nothing.

255
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,077
He won't let me leave.

256
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,556
If I sent a cab to pick you up,
is that something you'd be interested in?

257
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,875
- You knew, you motherfucker?
- I knew what?

258
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,558
That you called me a douchebag?

259
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,910
- I'm sensitive, did you know that?
- You will pay for this.

260
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,837
You OK in there, Eric?

261
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,474
I'll be right there, Bob.

262
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,911
Somebody's in a mood.

263
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,200
- Yes?
- Saigon ain't in there, is he?

264
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,232
- Excuse me?
- Never mind. Thank you.

265
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,912
- Nice plan.
- Just keep moving. Stop being lazy.

266
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,918
If I have to do this myself
we'll be here all night.

267
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,748
Looking for someone named Saigon.

268
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,959
Forget it.

269
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,551
This sucks. Should have spent
my day with Vince.

270
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,629
Bob, please! I need to go home.

271
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,593
- Just looking for the car keys, Eric.
- You have a driver, Bob.

272
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,108
Gave up looking for the driver, Eric.

273
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,878
Joey Ramone.

274
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,717
You're too young to know who that is.

275
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,672
I know him well.
These guys are from the same street as us.

276
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,188
- You come from Queens?
- Born and raised.

277
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,879
Vince too. It's actually his favourite band.

278
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,435
Too bad you don't have
a project about them, Bob.

279
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,869
If I told you
that somewhere in this house

280
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,480
I've got a script about The Ramones...

281
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,798
Yes, if I can read it on the way home,
it's something I'd be interested in.

282
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,035
Don't be a wise-ass.

283
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,637
- Nobody home.
- OK, that's it. I'm done.

284
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,274
No, you are not done.
You work for me, remember?

285
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,880
- This is my day.
- That isn't official.

286
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,115
You think you're having
a bad day, Drama?

287
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,196
This is the worst day of my life.

288
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,595
Come on, man.
Stick with me, please?

289
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,198
You're right, Turtle.

290
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,515
I'm sorry. Let's go check the fourth floor.

291
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,318
What floor y'all going to?

292
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,628
Whatever floor y'all going to.

293
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,357
Hey, looks like we're going
to the same party, ladies.

294
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,076
What's up, ladies?

295
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,270
Grab that drink and drone in here.

296
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,231
- OK.
- Sure a party.

297
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,669
I remember ordering the bitches,

298
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,029
but I don't recall ordering no white boys.

299
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,911
We're here to see Saigon.

300
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,679
- Was he expecting you?
- Bingo.

301
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,077
Of course. We got more class
than to show up unannounced.

302
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,192
- Bedroom.
- Thank you.

303
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,515
What's up with you bad cats?

304
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,990
Yo, Sai, what the fuck?

305
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,110
Shit. Turtle, what are you doing here?

306
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,674
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

307
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,280
You missed the signing.
I've been calling you.

308
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,992
I should have called you back.

309
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,759
- You think?
- Shut the fuck up, Drama.

310
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,599
Come outside, man. Let me talk to you
away from all these nosy motherfuckers.

311
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,830
I swear to God I've never done this before.

312
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,348
Are you a virgin?

313
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,039
No, middle of the day,

314
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,116
a stranger.

315
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,071
We should do it again.

316
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,951
Yeah, maybe.

317
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,073
Maybe? Come on, I think we get along great.
And I'm not working.

318
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,839
Do you really like me?

319
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,068
Are you kidding?

320
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,111
I don't know. I mean,

321
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,594
come on, you must have, like, a million girls.

322
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,553
Yeah, sure, I have a couple of options.
I'm not gonna lie.

323
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,070
I had a great time.
I think we should do it again tomorrow.

324
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,950
- Vince, I can't.
- Why not?

325
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,512
I'm getting married.

326
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,432
No, really.

327
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,114
- You're getting married?
- Yeah.

328
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,720
- Oh, Jesus.
- No, it's not what you think.

329
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,719
- See, you were on my list.
- Your list?

330
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,557
My celebrity list.

331
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,717
Me and my fiancé,
we both have them

332
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,115
and we agreed that
if either one of us

333
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,196
ever had the chance to...

334
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,879
and, well...

335
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,629
Now I just have to hope
he doesn't run into Cameron Diaz.

336
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,709
You're my nigga. I appreciate
everything you've done, for real.

337
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,752
But. There's always a but.

338
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,314
Shut the fuck up, Drama!

339
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,828
- But I got another manager.
- What?

340
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,758
I signed with this guy like ten years ago.

341
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,109
- He skipped town on me.
- You signed papers?

342
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,116
This guy don't work with papers, man.

343
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,991
He's holding me to my contract.

344
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,712
What about the deal I got you?

345
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,799
I appreciated that even though it was
with the whitest hip-hop label around.

346
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,115
But he got me a better deal, man.

347
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,832
And that's why we're here now.

348
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,633
I'd like to have a word with
this alleged manager.

349
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,033
- Oh, yeah, Drama?
- Yeah.

350
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,036
Here he comes.
Yo, Bunky, what up?

351
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,389
What up, Sai-diddy?
Who are these crackers?

352
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,237
Crackers?

353
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,953
Turtle, this is my boy
I was telling you about.

354
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,117
- You tell him it was good?
- Yeah, he did.

355
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,833
But did Saigon tell you
he's got papers with Turtle?

356
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,192
That was drafted by the law firm
of Zyman, Weintraub...

357
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,231
and three other Jewish names I have forgotten.

358
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,999
Well, he was supposed
to tell you I deaded those.

359
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,350
Since he didn't, I'm telling you.
Those contracts are dead.

360
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,756
Bunk, what do you say we don't try
and strong-arm each other?

361
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,349
My man Turtle has got
signed legal documents.

362
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,789
What is threatening us gonna do?

363
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,958
Show this scarecrow the view.

364
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,353
Scarecrow?

365
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,994
- I got a pilot this week!
- What the fuck?

366
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,190
Chill!

367
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,399
He getting heavy yet?

368
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,432
You gonna throw him over the balcony
with 50 witnesses?

369
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,199
I got 10 witnesses
that's gonna swear he jumped.

370
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,470
Yo, cuz, man, no need
for all this shit, man.

371
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,431
We agreed you'd take care of Turtle.

372
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,155
I didn't know I'd get insulted
by the dude from Viking Quest.

373
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,838
You watch Viking Quest?

374
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,270
Tell him how much you was
supposed to get off the deal you got me.

375
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,390
60 grand.

376
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,356
All right, break the kid off his 60.

377
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,709
But if I find out it was a penny less,

378
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,796
I'm gonna make a house call, for real.

379
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,680
- It might have been 40.
- That's what I thought.

380
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,439
- Malik, break him off 35.
- Let him get his 40, man.

381
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,112
Give him his 40.

382
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,712
You OK, Drama?

383
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,558
Yeah. You should have held out.

384
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,352
I think I could've made the pool.

385
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,754
This is great, Bob. I love the angle.

386
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,633
The Ramones started
the punk rock movement, Eric.

387
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,750
They never got the credit they deserved.

388
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,031
- How come they never made this?
- We came close many times.

389
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,356
Oliver Stone was gonna do it
and then The Doors came up.

390
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,949
Morrison was dead
and it seemed a better sale, so...

391
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,878
Now that Joey Ramone is gone,
we can sell this.

392
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,837
I love your passion, Eric.

393
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,313
I love it.

394
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,432
Here's our guy. Excuse me, driver,
would you pull over?

395
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,232
Hey, Vince, hop in.

396
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,757
- What's happening, man?
- Not much.

397
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,269
- How was your day?
- Uneventful.

398
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,595
- You?
- We had a lovely day.

399
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,914
Who's this?

400
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,388
A pleasure.

401
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,510
Bob Ryan?
Butch Cassidy Bob Ryan?

402
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,711
- Someone with a sense of history.
- Great to meet you.

403
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,558
- We found your next movie, Vince.
- What's that?

404
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,831
See if this is something
you might be interested in.

405
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,999
Vince, what's up?

406
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,838
It's time to go to work, Ari.
I've got my next project.

407
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,472
And his next producer.

408
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,670
You might be interested
