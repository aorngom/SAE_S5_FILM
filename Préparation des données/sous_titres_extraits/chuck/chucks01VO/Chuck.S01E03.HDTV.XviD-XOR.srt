00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,610
tehran,iran

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,140
Not very good

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,830
Terrible use of color

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,590
madrid barajas airport two weeks later

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,780
This looks like it was
painted by a five year-old

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,230
miller art gallery downtown los angeles

7
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,790
your money's on the desk.

8
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,550
what a piece of crap.

9
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,690
one month later northeast los angeles
Please...please don't shoot;don't shoot me.

10
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,420
Just put the gun down.

11
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,640
Gently.

12
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,800
I can't shoot. That's the problem.

13
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,100
The stupid thingis busted.

14
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,500
Well,when it comesto mr.Bartowski,my
friend,busted is just a state of mind.

15
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,380
Opening this puppy up. reconfigure that.

16
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,920
And ta-da--locked
and loaded. Try that.

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,370
nice shot. See?

18
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,230
- Chuck,big mikewants to see you.
- Not now,harry.

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,300
Can't you seeI'm with a
customer? I apologize,sir.

20
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,370
This is not normallyhow
we do things at buy more.

21
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,310
Now,chuck!

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,590
I was just on my wayto
see you-- that's crazy.

23
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,520
Pause that.

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,160
bartowski,what is itthat
you want out of life?

25
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,340
You mean,existentially--like,fulfillment,inner
peace,that kind of a thing?

26
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,340
Or are we talkingmore practically,like,lakers
tickets,personal steam room...

27
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,830
we're talking buy more.

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,590
Career objectives.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,730
Where do you see yourselfin
five years,ten years?

30
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,850
Honestly?

31
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,690
Honestly.

32
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,100
I have absolutely no idea.

33
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,080
Well,then it's timeyou
started to think about it.

34
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,740
As you know,there's an
assistantmanagement position open.

35
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,610
It's down to youand harry tang.

36
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,210
Now,you want that job or not?

37
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,810
I do,I do.

38
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,010
Uh,I'm sorry,big mike.

39
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,780
I absolutely want that job.

40
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,040
Well,then,bartowski,it's
your turnto show me something.

41
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,350
I got some bad news.

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,330
Big mike wants us tofix all
of this junk in two days,

43
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,930
or he's going to give the assistant
store managerposition to tang.

44
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,380
I'm sorry,guys.

45
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,080
And anna.

46
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,080
Guys is fine. I don't mind.

47
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,730
No,it's not right. We need to come
up withsomething non-gender specific.

48
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,280
How do we feel about team?

49
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,880
The little nerd herders?

50
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,880
The lesters?

51
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,920
Chuck's stable of hos.

52
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,570
Hey...

53
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,620
Oh,man,uh,heard big
mikethrew down the gauntlet.

54
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,890
Wanted to come byand
say I'd love to help.

55
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,710
But,a: I lackthe skill set,and
B.Old computersgive me the willies.

56
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,710
You have no idea how much courage
it's takenjust to stand here.

57
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,540
I'm really proudof you,buddy.

58
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,710
Thanks,bro.

59
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,750
I bring you news.

60
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,820
What?

61
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,190
Your lady's here.

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,120
And if I'm not oversteppingmy
bounds,looking good.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,740
- Hey.
- Hey.

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,810
Give me a kiss.

65
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,070
I'm sorry. What?

66
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,730
We've been onthree dates.

67
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,970
We have to sell it.

68
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,360
That's it?

69
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,630
I'm not really goodwith pda.

70
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,010
Well,let's gosomewhere more private.

71
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,530
Shall we?

72
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,300
Okay,he is so in. This is...

73
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,780
hey. Okay,whoa!

74
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,370
Why don'twe give the
kids a little privacy?

75
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,540
not cool.

76
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,540
Sorry to break upyour little tryst.

77
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,740
Next time you needto talk to the
subject,I'd appreciatea heads up.

78
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,410
Relax. I wouldn't dream of
starting without you,agent casey.

79
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,010
Mom,dad,can we get on with
it? I have hard drivesto fix.

80
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,400
Why are these people sleeping?

81
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,450
Casey: They're notsleeping.

82
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,470
They werekilled,chuck,and
we want to know why.

83
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,440
I have no idea.

84
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,060
Well,look again.

85
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,900
I would rather not. It's kind of creepy.

86
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,360
Sorry.

87
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,980
I was goingto take a nap.

88
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,630
I'll come back in five. Kind
of called dibs on the couch?

89
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,750
Chuck,what did you see?

90
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,750
Um,I don'T...I'm not...
I'm not totally sure.

91
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,350
A water lily painting,weapons,an
art auction tomorrow night.

92
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,240
Does the name la
ciudadmean anything to you?

93
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,320
Why?

94
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,440
Because I thinkhe's going to be
at the art auctiontomorrow night.

95
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,270
Right then.

96
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,290
I'm goingto go fix some hard drives.

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,030
Good luck with the spy stuff. Excuse me.

98
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,290
Ellie: Chuck,I am so proud of you.

99
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,040
Morgan told me about
theassistant management job.

100
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,760
Congratulations.

101
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,300
Team bartowski moving
upin the world,huh?

102
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,710
okay,first of all,it's not mine yet,and
second of all,you can ease upon the enthusiasm.

103
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,540
It's only a two dollar an hour
raise at anelectronics store,

104
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,850
and it doesn't even give
memy own parking space.

105
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,410
Well,does your lack of interestmean that

106
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,300
you're actually considering leaving
the buy morefor a real profession?

107
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,840
Real profession? Sorry.

108
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,020
I'm goingto need clarification on that.

109
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,030
He went to stanford,for
god's sakes,morgan.

110
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,060
Right,and was unceremoniouslyexpelled
sophomore year--

111
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,060
sorry to bring that up,champ-- butI think
we need to be realistic about our goals here.

112
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,680
His goals or your goals?

113
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,450
Great question,and I think we need to hammer outa
plan for chuck. Where do we see him in five years?

114
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,480
- Ten years?
- We?

115
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,500
Fine. Then just you and I.

116
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,590
Woman: We're glad to hear you've
settled into chuck's apartment building.

117
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,510
But if he's right,this
is a high priority.

118
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,510
La ciudad is the most elusive and
dangerous arms dealer in the world.

119
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,460
And the last anyone heard,mi-6 in
london had a drop on him,but he vanished.

120
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,640
Well,if he turns up,we'll
justtake him down at the auction.

121
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,630
Man: Not so easy.

122
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,960
We have no idea whathe
looks like,no photographs.

123
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,900
No one has ever seen la ciudadthat
has lived to tell about it.

124
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,360
So we'll bringthe intersect.

125
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,880
Everything you knowabout la
ciudad was fed into that computer.

126
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,130
No way. It is too dangerous.

127
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,090
He has no field experienceor training.

128
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
He'll be fine. It's an art auction.

129
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,360
Morgan: Listen to me-- it
isway to scary out there.

130
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,930
Chuck can't leavethe buy more.

131
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,220
We're stillfinding ourselves.

132
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,040
Ellie: No offense,morgan,but I think my brother
has spent quitea few years finding himself,

133
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,840
and he's definitely proventhat his
place in life is not at the buy more.

134
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,800
Morgan:You don't understand.
He is a fragilelittle gelding.

135
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,310
You know,still tryingto find his legs.

136
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,790
The real world will crush him.

137
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,020
Do you knowwhat a gelding is?

138
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,480
it's the... that weird
creaturefrom the dark crystal.

139
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,980
Smells like gelding. That-that guy.

140
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,430
He'll be fine.

141
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,190
La ciudad probablywon't even be there.

142
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,150
And if he is,is it worth the risk?

143
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,990
All right,I've heard enough.

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,010
Put him in the field.

145
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,770
We don't know what he's capable
of until he's been tested.

146
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,240
What he needs issomething
to challenge him.

147
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,320
To test hislimitations.

148
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,430
A brush withhis own mortality.

149
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,460
You know what I'm thinking?

150
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,640
I have no ideawhat you're thinking.

151
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,210
As far as I'm concerned,dude,you're
way off the reservation.

152
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,260
Class five whitewater rapids.

153
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,850
Just the two ofus this weekend.

154
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,270
Near-deathexperience.

155
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,540
Awesome!

156
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,520
That sounds great,but my wet
suit'sat the dry cleaners.

157
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,090
That is a terrible idea.

158
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,130
That's way too dangerous.

159
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,160
I agree,and I am not comfortable with you
guys spendingthat amount of time together.

160
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,940
Well,chuck hasn't said a
word. What do you want to do?

161
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,650
I'm just going to hit the sack.

162
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,850
Good night,team bartowski.

163
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,490
that's-that's great work,guys.

164
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,740
You see what you're doing
here? That's awesome.

165
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,830
Congratulations,chuck.

166
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,290
You just got your
firstmission-- tomorrow night.

167
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,920

as more of a shoe event?

173
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,160
I rented you a tux.

174
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,370
Oh,that's very nice...

175
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,280
how did you know my size?

176
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,850
Nsa-- they have records of your
rental information from prom night.

177
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,440
I checked the suit in your closet.

178
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,390
Okay,this is my first foray
into major undercover spy work,

179
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,430
so you could ease up on the
sarcasm. That would be great.

180
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,280
And how am I supposed to recognize la
ciudad? Is there a picture or something?

181
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,580
If there was a photograph,why
would we need you?

182
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,800
What did we just talk about?

183
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,470
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,260
We're hoping something in
the event triggers a flash.

185
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,530
See,that's all you had to say.

186
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,860
Now,uh,hand-to-hand
combat-- in all seriousness,

187
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,140
if it comes down to me and la ciudad in
some fisticuffs or something,is there,

188
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,140
like,a 20-minute tutorial
you can take me through?

189
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,330
Don't worry. You're going to be fine.

190
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,060
Nothing's going to happen to you.

191
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,490
Assuming you know how to tango.

192
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,920
Seriously?

193
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,460
Oh,I don't joke about your life.

194
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:02,810
Right.

195
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,300
Chuck,your girlfriend's here.

196
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,880
One minute,I have computers to fix.

197
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,440
Anna: Don't worry about it. We got it.

198
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,440
There's only a few left.

199
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,440
What? Are you sure?

200
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,610
It's done,but next time I have a big
date,you are going to cover for me.

201
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,830
Okay.Great. Thanks,team.

202
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,590
I'll see you tomorrow.

203
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,740
Thanks,team.

204
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,000
Where are you lovebirds headed?

205
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,310
We're actually going to an art
auction at the wilshire grand.

206
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,510
Swanky!

207
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,780
Yeah,I like it,man.

208
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,590
Uh,aren't we moving
a little too fast now?

209
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,810
Career,girl.

210
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,090
Guy's got it all.

211
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,690
The idea with a cover is to keep it as simple as
possible without revealing true personal detail.

212
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,040
Any thoughts on a name?

213
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,300
Charles carmichael?

214
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,520
Simple,dignified.

215
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,560
- Easy to remember and not far off from...
- graduated with honors from stanford.

216
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,070
Runs a hugely successful
software company.

217
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,400
Semi-retired and is considering
entering america's cup.

218
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,170
Have you donethis before?

219
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,830
Let's just say,uh,mr. Carmichael
and I sharea small kinship.

220
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,850
How's that?

221
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,390
When I first entered stanford,

222
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,670
it's kind of where I envisionedmyself
being by now,except for the sailing part.

223
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,360
I don't really knowwhere that came from.

224
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,540
But he's where most
of my classalready is.

225
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,000
So,what happened?

226
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,900
My life took a little
detoursophomore year

227
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,760
when our old friendbryce larkin
discovered stolen testsunder my bed,

228
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,600
and was kind enoughto
alert administration.

229
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,770
Did you steal the tests?

230
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,070
I thought it was kind of
impliedthat I'm a decent person.

231
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,780
Well,we all make mistakes.

232
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,440
And I made plenty. That
just wasn't one of them.

233
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,970
But,hey,then bryce sent mea whole database of
government secretsthat are now locked in my brain,

234
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,370
keeping me in a constant stateof fear,danger
and anxiety,so I'd say we're even.

235
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,960
Don't worryabout tonight.

236
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,350
No reason tobe nervous.

237
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,720
I am not going toleave your side.

238
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,600
Me nervous? Come on.Never.

239
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,170
Your hand isa little moist.

240
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,000
It does thatwhen I'm freaking out.

241
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,380
Hey,sis.

242
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,860
Hey,sis,um... do you know how to tango?

243
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,700
No,why?

244
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,870
Oh,no reason.

245
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,020
I just,I have a date tonight.

246
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,100
I thought it might come up.

247
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,980
You're tangoing on a date?

248
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,640
Well,that's definitelynew territory.

249
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,390
It's good to see you
reachingoutside of your comfort zone.

250
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,210
Well,consideringmy comfort zone
extends to the endof that couch,

251
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,670
new territorywas bound to come up.

252
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,100
Did someone say tango?

253
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,240
No,thank you,captain
awesome,I'll look it up online.

254
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,730
Would you please put on
something,a robe or something?

255
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,940
Did a semester abroadin buenos aires.

256
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,420
Spent many a nighttangoing my
way into seÒoritas' pantalones.

257
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,090
And... go.

258
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,860
There's no way he's going to
breakthe two minute record.

259
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,740
Ooh,there.

260
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,040
It's okay,sweetheart.

261
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,760
Lester is right here.

262
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,890
Sorry to interrupt.

263
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,800
But we found just a few
moredown by the loading dock.

264
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,640
Where's bartowski?

265
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,780
On a date with a smoking
hotwiener girl,no biggie.

266
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,570
And he left you all here?

267
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,850
Good leadership.

268
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,850
Real good.

269
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,130
Well,it shouldn't be too difficult
to getthese done by morning.

270
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,590
I'll leave the coffee pot on.

271
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,030
done.

272
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,890
What are those?

273
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,790
Morgan,what are those?

274
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,790
Tank.

275
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,790
Here. This is for you.

276
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,940
Inside the watchis a tracking system.

277
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,510
That way you can'trun away from me.

278
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,020
And if you flash on anyone,tell me
immediatelyand then stay out of the way.

279
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,310
Absolutely,yeah.

280
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,050
I,uh,I always runfrom a fight.

281
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,590
This isn't a joke,chuck.

282
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,000
No one who's ever seen
youhas lived to tell about it.

283
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,410
Is he being serious? Seriously?

284
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,870
What are my chancesof
getting into trouble?

285
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,280
Toughen up,you'll be fine...

286
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,810
assuming you know how to tango.

287
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,140
I did somepreparation,okay?

288
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,200
I wouldn't callmyself an expert...

289
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,830
why would he need to know
howto tango? Is that code?

290
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,130
No,not-- no,he told me thatI
needed to know how to tango...

291
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,580
- Spy humor,I like that.
- Come on,you ready?

292
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,010
Okay,wait,wait. Where's
everybody going,huh?

293
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,960
We got computers to fix.

294
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,460
Sorry,bro,I got mybar mitzvah lesson.

295
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,340
Internet poker.

296
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,480
I'm off by 8:00and hammered by 8:05.

297
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,030
What about chuck bartowski?

298
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,670
Okay,what about our fearlessleader?

299
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,550
We owe him.

300
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,380
- For what?
- What?

301
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,940
'Cause tonight,chuck bartowski's boldly
going where none of ushave ever gone before--

302
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,300
to have intercoursewith
a beautiful woman.

303
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,600
Speak for yourself.

304
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,580
- Interesting.
- Interesting.

305
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,150
I'm out of here. I gotta go.

306
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,350
Anna,could
I-- anna?

307
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,190
Okay. Okay,fine.

No more xbox tournaments.

No more porn.

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,390
Yeah,yeah. Total work hell.

316
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,520
I'm in,but your
boybetter close the deal.

317
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,380
Let's do this.

318
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,320
- Okay,thanks a lot,lester.
- Don't touch me.

319
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,410
I'm going to talk to youabout
this whole girl thing.

320
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,340
Hey,jeff,atta boy,huh?

Oh,nice,yes,thank you.

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,990
Oh,nice.

323

I've been a spyall of five seconds and
I already havesoy sauce on my shirt.

324
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,770
Well,go and wash it off.

325
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,260
And chuck,stop sayingthat you're a spy.

326
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,770
Right,of course.

327
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,530
Idiot.

328
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,930
Do we know each other?

329
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,840
No.

330
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,850
No,not that I know of.

331
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,910
Sorry.

332
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,160
- It's him.
- Who?

333
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,220
La ciudad.

334
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,420
Come on.

337
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,520
Chuck,go wait at the bar.

338
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,700
Go wait... wait at the bar?

339
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,150
Okay,you go do what you do. I'm
going to beat the bar,waiting there.

340
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,150
Covering that whole area.

341
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,320
Drink,sir?

342
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,540

345
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,700

Are you kidding?

379
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,070
Do you think chuck couldafford

You needa key to open it.

Then get the key,jeff.

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,660
There's only two keys.

Harry tang has one.

394
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,960
And old chuck has the other one.

443
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,130

444
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,500
Chuck,i think your handis
supposed to be on my hip.

445
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,740
Right.

446
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,350
Uh,apparently,I learned the
girl'spart of this dance.

447
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,960
Would you mind leading?

448
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,690
Not at all.

449
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,320
Federal agent. Don't move.

450
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,630
Don't you move.

451
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,440
Internationalagents--
mi-6.

452
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,140
Drop your gun!

453
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,660
- We're britishsecret service.
- Lower your weapon!

454
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,780
Everyone take a deep breath.

455
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,800
I'm puttingdown my gun,and
I'm gettingmy identification.

456
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,420
Slowly.

457
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,530
What are youdoing here?

458
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,580
I could ask you the same thing.

459
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,040
We've been pursuingan arms
dealer through five countries.

460
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,320
Let me guess. La ciudad?

461
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,610
That's right.

462
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,970
Mi-6 intercepteda painting with
plutoniumhidden in the frame.

463
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,370
Rather thanannounce the
bust,we removedthe plutonium

464
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,690
and kept the auction in
the hopeof luring ciudad.

465
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,630
If you're not la
ciudad,then where is he?

466
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,320
Whoa,whoa,whoa,okay,okay,listen
to me,so,listen to me.

467
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,000
My friend is at some sort of
artfunction at your hotel,okay?

468
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,370
Uh,now listento me clearly.

469
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,590
I need to speak to him.

470
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,640
It's a matter of life and death.

471
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,000
Describe your friend.

472
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,730
Morgan:He's good-looking.

473
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,610
You know,it depends on
your angle,I suppose.

474
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,560
Uh,he's not classicallyhandsome.

475
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,720
I wouldn't say he is,you know.

476
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,510
But he makes up for itwith
charm. Lots of,uh...of charm.

477
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,550
And he's kind of a lost soul.

478
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,750
Does this funny little
thingwhen he's nervous.

479
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
He laughs. He goes...

480
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,840
he kind of does this...

481
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,930
uh,anyways,what,uh,what,what?

482
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,280
Uh,brown hair,six-one.

483
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,370
Does that help at all?

484
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,520
What,uh...

485
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,900

486
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,540
Why are you so interested,mr.Carmichael?

487
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,320
No reason. Just making conversation.

488
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,300
Excuse me,sir.

489
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,780

490
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,860

492
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,100
Uh,that's him. That's
my... that's my friend.

493
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,420
I can hear his voice. Hey,chuck!

494
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,880
Are you sure you'renot mr.Bartowski?

495
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,130
Your friend insists.

496
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,500
No,no,I insist.

497
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,270
I've never heardthat name in my life.

498
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,010
I got to go. Excuse me.

499
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:44,960
Why don't we head up tomy room

501
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,310
Uh,so I guess we

502
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,300
Good idea.

503
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,200
No,wait,wait,wait,wait.

504
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,110
Dude,it's just... it's

505
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,800
I got to get someserious alcohol
in me or I am nevergoing to sleep.

506
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,500
Anna: I'm sorry,morgan. Be strong.

507
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,200

511
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,140
Malena: Let's startwith an easy one.

512
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,220

514
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,470
Chuck bartowski.

515
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,190
That wasn't so hard.

516
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,430
Now...

517
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,780
before you answermy next question,

518
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:50,270
I want you to think long
andhard about my options here.

519
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:55,300
There's the old favorite--
yank out a tooth.

520
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,430
Too noisy.

521
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,330
cut off a toe.

522
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,420
That's too messy.

523
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,560
Far too messy.

524
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,680
Or we can chuck you offthe balcony...

525
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,970
chuck.

526
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,480
Probably landface first.

527
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:11,070
Teeth go through theback of your head.

528
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,140
not a good way to go. So...

529
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:20,420
here's my question: Who do you work for?

530
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,720
No one.

531
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,530
No,no,stop,stop!

532
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,850
I fix computersfor a living!

533
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,640
I swear to god!

534
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,800
I snuck into the partyunder
a fake name to impress a girl!

535
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,010
Please,please,down... put chair down!

536
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,670
Good-bye,chuck.

537
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,840
No,no,no,it's a setup!

538
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,790
What is?

539
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,470
The painting?

540
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,560
The painting.

541
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,780
The painting,I think.

542
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,660
I think the painting
mightbe a fake or something.

543
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,520
Why?

544
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,770
If you put me downI'll tell you.

545
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,040
I saw a photoof the painting
in the L.A.Times,okay?

546
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,570
But it hada different frame.

547
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,590
So I'm assuming somebody maybe
swapped it out,I don't know.

548
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,450
But if I were you,I would
not buy that painting.

549
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,930
A fake painting.

550
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,500
And you had no
intentionof bidding on it?

551
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,310
Me? Bid on...

552
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,130
No,not unless they
wereselling it for 25 bucks.

553
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,960
I mean,that's about what I
havein my decorating budget.

554
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,700
Okay,tell me howto fix a computer,chuck.

555
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,960
my first inclination isthat your bus speed
is not up to snuff with your video card.

556
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,930
I'm assuming we're talking
about a pc here,right?

557
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,380
Is your memorydedicated?

558
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,320
That's enough,mr.Bartowski.

559
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,610
I believe you.

560
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,180
the problem is since you've
seen me,now I have to kill you.

561
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,110
Have... have to,have to?

562
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,500
No,no,no,I disagree,I disagree...

563
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,490
vehemently,vehemently.

564
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,900
No,no,no,I won't
sayanything,I swear to god.

565
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,680
You don't know the things
I know about people.

566
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,410
Don't worry,it'll be fast.

567
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,780
Good-bye,mr.Bartowski.

568
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,290
I enjoyed our tango.

569
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,700
I didn't likeit that much.

570
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,090
- Really?
- He was kind of silly.

571
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,390
Oh,I kind of liked him. Hi.

572
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,710
They're on to us.

573
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,700
The sec knows everything.

574
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,890
Shelly,they knowabout the caymans.

575
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,710
I surrender! I surrender!

576
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,590
Get down,chuck.

577
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,010
Chuck:Sarah!

578
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,570
Let's do this.

579
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,970
oh,my god!

580
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,170
it's okay,chuck.

581
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,580
- Are you okay?
- Okay?Okay?

582
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,910
Two more seconds andI'd have been dead.

583
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,200
They were going tothrow
me off the balcony.

584
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,420
Did you tell themyou work for us?

585
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,210
Of course not.

586
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,430
Where the hellwere you guys?

587
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,310
You're still alive.

588
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,690
I'd consider myself lucky.

589
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,680
We have to get youout of the country.

590
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,830
First we take him out.

591
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,160
Hey.

592
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,060
How was the big date?

593
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,140
It was good,great,fine.
I'm going to go to bed.

594
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:11,880
- I love you.
- What?

595
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,860
No,no,no,no.

596
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:14,860
Is that all I get?

597
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,410
Come on,sit down.

598
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,080
I want to know,you
know,do you like this girl?

599
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,930
It'S... you know,it's complicated.

600
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,290
Well,explain it to me
slowly,I'll catch up.

601
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,620
She's a very beautiful girl.

602
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,720
Good. Go on.

603
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,490
And she's very agile.

604
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,130
I'm not sure how
thatapplies,but continue.

605
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,320
And I think she's tooexhausting for me.

606
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,090
Well,what happened?

607
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,850
Did you guys tango?

608
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,140
Oh,yeah,yeah. We tangoed.

609
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:49,830
In fact,we tangoedquite a bit,but awesome
taught methe woman's pa of the tango,

610
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,060
so it was a little
difficult,as one might expect.

611
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,820
Awesome:What's up,bro?

612
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,290
- Did you do thefamous dip?
- Yeah.

613
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,670
I was on thereceiving end of that dip.

614
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,200
You did tango witha woman,right?

615
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,600
And on that note...

616
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,570
no,no,no,no,no. You're
notgetting off that easy.

617
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,200
Why won't you talk to me?

618
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,630
It's...

619
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,240
it's complicated,okay? Just let it go.

620
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,230
Fine.

621
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,340
You don't wantto talk to me,

622
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,540
I suggest you findsomeone to talk
to like maybe your idiot friend.

623
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,500
He's called about 75 times.

624
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,670
He locked himselfin a storage cage.

625
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,050
Whatever that means.

626
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,720
Oh,god! It's you.

627
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,570
Dude,dude,you have no idea.

628
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,540
Okay,okay,okay.

629
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,930
Settle down,settle down,settle down.

630
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,550
Settle downit's all good. It's all good.

631
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,760
What happened?

632
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,280
Oh,what happened?

633
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,770
Tang showed up,and he
dropped all these off.

634
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,570
I guess he was stashingthem,you know?

635
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,860
So...

636
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,770
all right,let's do this.

637
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,490
What are you talking... Morgan,you
don't knowhow to fix a computer.

638
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,710
Moral support,man. Never...

639
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,120
never leaveyour wingman,okay?

640
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,090
Something your team couldlearn
a little something about.

641
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,290
Look,it's okay,man.

642
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,310
Go get some sleep,okay?

643
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,860
Are you sure?

644
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,800
'Cause you say the word
and we go down together.

645
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,380
No. I appreciate that,but I think it'll be
nice to do somethingI'm actually good at,

646
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,340
so I'll see you.

647
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,350
Fantastic. I'll see
you later.Good night.

648
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,780
Good night.

649
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,210
You finished,bartowski?

650
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,810
Mission accomplished.

651
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,740
Two days was meantas an incentive.

652
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,160
I didn't think you'd really do it.

653
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,070
I'm impressed.

654
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,770
And I'm not a maneasily impressed.

655
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:11,300
Why,I think you should know thatI only fixed
the last few--my team did most of the work.

656
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,170
They deserve the credit.

657
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,600
And you're only as
goodas your team,so...

658
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:17,160
first rule of
management:Always take credit.

659
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,530
Hope we can sell all this crap.

660
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:24,980
Sir,there's beena major infraction--
drinkingalcoholic beverages on the property.

661
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:28,190
Nothing wrong with a man wetting
his whistleevery once in a while.

662
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,640
Keep it out of thestore,bartowski.

663
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,350
Yeah.Yeah. Absolutely,sir.

664
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,890
You get extra points for style.

665
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,680
Looking sharp.

666
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,470
You look like a waiter.

667
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,520
kiss-ass.

668
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,800
Was I scared?

669
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,170
Yeah. Yeah,I was scared.

670
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,860
But then this
survivalinstinct kicked in.

671
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:49,200
Something I didn'teven know I possessed.

672
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,410
A desire to live.

673
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,350
Good news is,I may be ableto
retire off this,all right?

674
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,280
I talked to big mike.

675
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,830
I told him he'd be
hearingfrom my attorney.

676
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,750
That cage isa major fire hazard.

677
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,260
Chuck.

678
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,490
Good work last night.

679
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,410
Okay,you know what?

680
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,740
I'm,I'm workingon an
all-nighter here,big guy.

681
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,820
And I realize that
you areprobably armed.

682
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,900
And so I'm gonna ask youvery nicely,would
you please easeup on the sarcasm.

683
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,680
I wasn't being facetious.

684
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,160
You helped us find la ciudad.

685
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,050
But she got away.

686
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,110
Yeah,we got a photofrom hotel security.

687
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,490
We got a blood samplefrom
a broken window.

688
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,820
Our intel tell usshe's heading
down to central america.

689
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,170
We have peoplewaiting there.

690
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,480
You're lookin' sharp.

691
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,910
Yeah,thanks.

692
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,470
That was facetious. Idiot.

693
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,800
I fixed this one personally.

694
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,400
So it should begood as new.

695
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,300
And sorry about the delay.

696
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,010

00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,890

733
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:14,980
Oh,good news.

00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:18,420
They fixed the lock

735
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,480

736
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,770
I'm really sorry,sis.

737
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,810
I-I know that I'vebeen kind of evasive.

738
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,710
It's just that I...

739
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,490
I didn't want to lie to you and I chose notsaying
anything as being the lesserof two evils.

740
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,640
Why would youhave to lie to me?

741
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,330
Ellie,I just need youto trust me and
know it has nothingto do with you.

742
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,930
But you want me to butt out. I get it.

743
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,720
It's none of my business.

744
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,260
No! No,no,no,no,I'm not saying that!

745
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,480
I'm not saying that. I-I...

746
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:49,320
I just don't wantto create a false senseof
excitement for a relationshipthat seems doomed.

747
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,540
Why is it doomed?

748
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,280
Because she'snot into me.

749
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,340
Uh,trust me.

750
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,990
I have seen the way thatthat girl
looks at you and she is into you.

751
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,880
Really?

752
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,930
It's noneof my business.

753
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:05,790
Okay,no.

754
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,690
Okay,fine. What the hell.

755
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,330

want to ask me about sarah?

756
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,780
Really?

757
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,680
You better hurry up.
This offerwill not last.

758
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:15,970
Okay. Do you like her?

759
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,260

Chuck,that's it.

765
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,480
I don't need to know
theintimate details,okay?

766
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,220
As long as you're
happy,that's enough for me.

767
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:37,350
And I don't,I don't want to nag
you about yourfuture and your job.

768
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,390
I don't wantto be the sister that
just pestersyou into oblivion.

769
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,740
No,no,no,no,you're,you're not a pest.

00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,820

so surethat he knows it.

772
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,480
How do you feel about a

781
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,500

You did really good,chuck.

790
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,870
Stop it.

791
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,210
I'm not really a spy.

792
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,580
Your computer ended upin the head of a guy
who only knows how to fix 'em,nothing else.

793
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,540
You surviveda near-death experience
under the threatof torture

794
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,290
and apprehended one of the
world'smost elusive killers.

795
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,270
I'm not sure you what
you thinkspies do exactly,

796
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,510
but most of us wouldconsider
that a pretty good day.

797
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,630
Okay,sure,so todayI helped take down
a major internationalarms dealer,

798
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,840
but tomorrow,tomorrow I still
gotta goclock in at buy more.

799
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,370
I mean,what's the goodof being
a hero if nobody knows about it?

800
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,290
You know.

801
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,650
And so do I.

802
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:41,400
You know,if wewere really
dating,this would bethe part

803
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,910
where I'd be forced
to kissyou good night.

804
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,790
Forced?

805
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,890
Would it beso bad?

806
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,110
I'm sure I could sufferthrough it.

807
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,250
Me,too.

808
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,990
