1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,000
Go back, go back.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,000
That is God and a surgeon
working in harmony.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,900
Here comes
the Schwarma girl.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,400
Hey.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,700
Hey...

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,000
Here you guys go.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,200
Be careful, it's really hot.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,400
I don't want to... for you
to burn your tongue on it.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Wow, 29 orders this month. 

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,100
One more, and you'll get
a free baba ghanoush.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,100
Oh...

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,400
I'm reaching in my pocket
for money, not for...

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Hey, do you
have change?

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,700
Oh, she's...

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,500
Did you get it?
Fellas...

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,300
Oh, boy.

17
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,300
What are you guys doing?

18
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,100
Or have you forgotten
about Big Mike's pol

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,900
on "mammary cam"?

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,600
I don't know what you're
talking about, Chuck.

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,100
He doesn't know what I'm talking
about? That's so weird.

22
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,600
So, you didn't actually just
remove the offending video

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,500
from the camcorder and
then hand it to Lester,

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,900
who is now hiding it behind
his back?

25
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,200
What? Wow!

26
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,300
My feelings are hurt.

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,900
Charles,
after all these years,

28
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,500
where's the trust, my friend?

29
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,100
In Jeff's sweaty palms,

30
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,800
along with the amateur
consumer porn.

31
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,000
Look...
No, you look...

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Hey, Chuck? Uh, can
I talk to you for a sec?

33
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,800
Move.

34
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,900
Awesome...
to see you, Devon.

35
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, yeah.
What's up?
All right.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So, what's
on your mind?

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,800
Chuck, I was, I was hoping
to talk to you about Ellie.

38
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, of course.

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, you know,
ever since, um,

40
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,500
ever since we've been dating,
I've come to think of you 

41
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,800
as that little brother
I never had.

42
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,900
Don't you have
two younger brothers?

43
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,700
Indeed. Indeed.

44
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,000
But you seem like someone
who can offer sage wisdom 

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
in confusing times,

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and this is one of those times
I am really confused, bro.

47
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,100
I don't know how to put
this into words, really.

48
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,200
That's a bug.

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,500
What? What?

50
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,700
Spider, I hate those
fuzzy little bastards...

51
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,100
Oh, no. I think, uh, no,
you got him.

52
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,800
He was like...
and then poof! Gone.

53
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,100
Can you excuse me
for just one second?

54
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,100
I think I just saw a kid
climbing into an oven
over in Home Appliances.

55
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,500
Chuck!

56
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,000
Chuck, I need you to drop
some knowledge, bro.

57
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,700
Keep moving, Bartowksi.
Nothing to see here.

58
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,900
Not even if I had the time.

59
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,100
You're getting sloppy, Casey.

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,600
I understand that you have
some perverse desire

61
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
to listen to everybody,

62
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
but you really need to be more
careful when hiding your bugs.

63
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
What are you lip-smacking about,
Bartowski?

64
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,000
I just found <i>this</i> on one
of our product displays,

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,600
and not very well
hidden, I might add.

66
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,700
Normally, I'm a fan
of your craftsmanship,

67
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,700
if not your methods.

68
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,000
Look, all I'm saying is that
something like this discovered

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
by someone less in the know
than me could spell trouble.

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,200
You worry about that
supercomputer in your brain.

71
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
Let me worry
about the spy stuff, huh?

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,600
Don't you have a hard drive
you can go fix?

73
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
There's best buddy of mine.

74
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,200
Yeah. What's up?

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay, saw an Infinity Ward
mail in the trash,

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,100
and I'm guessing that means
you got a pre-release demo

77
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,400
of the next <i>Call of Duty</i> game?

78
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,600
Ah... Yeah, but the last time
I lent you a game sampler,

79
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,200
it ended up
all over the Internet.

80
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,600
So this one's gonna
stay in my locker,

81
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,900
and you can play it when
you get some adult supervision.

82
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,500
Adult super...?
Chuck, I'm almost at the age

83
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,000
where I should get my prostate
checked annually.

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,500
Okay? Surely I could be trusted
with an advance copy

85
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
of the next greatest video game
on the planet.

86
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,500
Have you seen Awesome?

87
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,800
Over by the Home Theater Room.

88
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
(muttering):
I think that's...

89
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,000
...really.

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
??

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,500
???

92
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,000
defrosting himself,
as it turns out.

93
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,100
So, uh, what, uh,
what's going on?

94
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,000
This is one of those
rare moments

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,700
when things are not kosher,
Chuck.

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,200
Oh, man.
This is harder than I thought.

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,600
Uh-huh.

98
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,700
Go... Go on.
I'm listening.

99
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,200
Right. Well...

100
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,700
I've been thinking a lot
about the way things are

101
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,900
between me
and your sister.

102
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,000
And you're the man in...
in Ellie's family,

103
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,600
so I was wondering...

104
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,700
Can I have your permission...

105
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,700
Can I marry Ellie?

106
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,400
Wow. That-That's quite...
quite a rock you got there.

107
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,700
Is that a yes? Dude...

108
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,600
Yes! Yes!

109
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,300
Sorry! I just...

110
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,500
You kind of--- waah!
You know, you pulled the blang

111
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,300
just right in...
Yes, you have my blessing.

112
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,800
Thank you. Thank you.

113
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,200
I mean, it's been in my family
for years.

114
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,300
This was my great-grandmother's.

115
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,000
(chuckles)
Ah, you think she'll like it?

116
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,800
Like it? She'll, she'll love it.

117
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,100
I, um, I'm just not sure

118
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,700
she'll be able to lift
her hand anymore.

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,300
Oh, one other thing.

120
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,900
Ellie is a bloodhound
when it comes to these
kind of things.

121
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,100
If I keep this in the apartment,
she will smell diamond.

122
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Can you hold onto this,
just for a day or so, man?

123
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,300
I mean, just till I figure out 
how to pop the question?

124
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,400
I don't think it's actually
a good idea...
Oh, thank you!

125
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,900
Thank you so much, bro.

126
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,200
Hey, pretty soon, I'm going
to mean that literally.

127
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,700
There you go.
All right...

128
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
We have a problem.

129
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
What do you mean?

130
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,900
Chuck found that
in the Buy More.

131
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,700
We have a problem.

132
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,400
BECKMAN:
 <i>The bug Chuck found is</i>

133
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,100
a GLG-20, one of the most
advanced counter-espionage

134
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,300
listening devices
in the CIA arsenal.

135
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,800
This is a CIA design?

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,900
Figures.

137
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,900
The GLG-20 is
a low-power transmitter.

138
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,800
In order to avoid detection,

139
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,100
it has a maximum range
of about 20 yards.

140
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Which means there's
probably a receiver

141
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,400
hidden somewhere
inside the Buy More.

142
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,800
GRAHAM:
We believe
it's recently become

143
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
a favorite
of the FULCRUM agents.

144
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,500
So, you're telling us the secret
government cabal that abducted

145
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Bryce Larkin and came
within a hair of figuring out

146
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,200
that Chuck's the Intersect is

147
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
now skulking
around the Buy More?

148
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,100
We need you to locate
that receiver,

149
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,400
and find the person
who planted it.

150
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,600
BECKMAN:
 <i>You have 48 hours.</i>

151
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,500
 <i>If you cannot identify the</i>
 <i>enemy operative in that time,</i>

152
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,600
we will have no choice
but to relocate Chuck

153
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,800
to a secure government
holding facility.

154
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,900

159
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
When are these young ladies
going to learn?

160
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,900
If they don't want someone
taking a picture

161
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,300
of their private business,
put some drawers on.

162
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Hey, uh, you think
we should make a run for it?

163
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,100
You don't run
from the cops.

164
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,200
It makes you look guilty,
or shot in the back.

165
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,400
We are guilty.
Shh!

166
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,500
Bring me down
and I will cut you.

167
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,200
So, no locks broken?
No alarms set off?

168
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,100
Nope. It's clean.

169
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,800
Must be an inside job.
Thought of that.

170
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,400
You really think any of these
dummies can mastermind all this?

171
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,500
It's almost always someone
close to the operation.

172
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,700
When I find out
who robbed my store

173
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,900
and stole my fish,

174
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm gonna break

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,100
my foot off
in his behind.

176
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,400
(whispers):
Oh, my God...

177
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,900
Shh!
Hi.

178
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,700
Hey.

179
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,400
What's with the police
presence outside?

180
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,000
They robbed the Buy More, man.

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,800
They took everything.

182
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,200
They took everything?
Everything.

183
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,000
Oh, please, God, no.

184
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,200
Please be there.

185
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,000
Oh, my God...

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,500
The ring.

187
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,100
They took Ellie's ring.

188
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,600
Oh, my God.

189
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,800
(panting):
Oh, oh...

190
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,700
Oh! Oh!

191
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,800
Hey...
Chuckles, what's up?

192
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,800
Dude, I figured out
how I'm gonna pop the Q.

193
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,200
The Q? What Q? What's a Q?

194
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,400
You know, the Q, the big Q
you only ask once in a lifetime.

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,900
Can't say right now... Mom.

196
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,400
Is that your mom?

197
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Tell her
that I love that

198
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,700
kittens-playing-with-the-yarn
sweater that she knitted me.

199
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,200
You got it, babe.

200
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,300
I'm going to do it
while we're skydiving.

201
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,500
Really?
Do you think, uh...

202
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Do you think
that's a good idea?

203
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,300
Not the first time we've been
in the mile-high club, buddy.

204
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,100
If you know what I mean.

205
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Yeah, uh...

206
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,500
Listen: skydiving is a little,
it's a little risky.

207
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,300
Don't you think? I mean,
you could drop the ring.

208
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,800
Whoa. Hot call, dude.

209
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,600
Hate to lose
my great-granny's ring.

210
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,900
She gave it to me
right before she passed.

211
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,000
You know? She knew Ellie was
the one before I did.

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,400
Great, great, okay, so...

213
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,000
just, you know, let me know

214
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,700
when you figure
something else out.
Okay.

215
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,300
But, Devon, um...

216
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,900
take your time.

217
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,900
You got it, brother.

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,500
(thuds)
Oh...

219
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Detective Conway here

220
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
is convinced
that this is an inside job.

221
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
And we intend to get
to the bottom of this.

222
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,000
Bartowski, get over here.

223
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,300
You're a suspect, too.

224
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
You all are!

225
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,600
When that pig
talks to you,

226
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,800
look him in the eye
and say nothing.

227
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,100
Zip it.

228
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,500
Nothing? Come on, that's
incredibly rude, Jeffrey.

229
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,200
Dead men tell
no tales.

230
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
Stop it.
Quit messing around.

231
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Bartowski, where's Casey?

232
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,900
Don't you two usually
carpool together?

233
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,100
Yes.
Yes, sir, we absolutely do.

234
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,200
But, uh... not today.

235
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,600
Why don't you go find out
why his ass is so tardy.

236
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,700
Someone might
find that suspicious.

237
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,600
Sure, I can-I can do that.

238
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
CASEY:
What?

239
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,100
Where are you?
Big Mike's looking for you.

240
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,500
Yeah, well, he's going to be
looking for both of us.

241
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,900
Now get down here, we need you.

242
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,000
No, no, no, no.
Listen to me.

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,700
I need you, okay?

244
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,200
Someone cleaned out the Buy More
last night.

245
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
They took everything;
they took my sister's ring,

246
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,400
the one she's supposed
to wear forever,

247
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
even though she doesn't
know it yet.

248
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,200
Awesome is supposed
to propose to her,

249
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,500
he trusted me
and now it's gone.

250
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Save it for your coffee
klatch, Bartowski.

251
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,500
Get down here.
We got bigger fish to fry.

252
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,200
You robbed the Buy More?

253
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,000
SARAH:
We had no choice, Chuck.

254
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,600
CHUCK:
No choice? Are you
out of your mind?

255
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,500
Do you have any idea
what's going on at
the store right now?

256
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
That bug you found,
it isn't one of ours.

257
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,100
What bug?
Who, ours?

258
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,300
SARAH:
The one you found yesterday.

259
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Casey only installed EM-50s.

260
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
The one you found was a GLG-20.

261
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,900
It requires a secondary
recording device nearby

262
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
to collect the data.

263
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,700
What are you talking about?

264
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,500
Someone is spying on us.

265
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,300
What?!

266
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,100
Okay, listen carefully--

267
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,700
the bug you found was not ours.

268
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
It belongs to an enemy agent,
probably Fulcrum,

269
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,200
and they planted it
in the Buy More.

270
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,100
Why?
Looking for
the Intersect.

271
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,300
They're looking for you.

272
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,100
We found a total of
29 bugs just like it,

273
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,100
but we still haven't
found the receiver.

274
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,900
CHUCK:
Okay.

275
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,500
Okay, well, wow.

276
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,100
Uh, extreme...
extreme measures,

277
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,700
but, uh, decisive action

278
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,400
had to be taken.

279
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,900
Good luck schlepping all this
stuff back to the Buy More.

280
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,600
Uh, I'm going to get
back there right now

281
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,900
and pretend like I
don't know anything.

282
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,600
Got any good tips
for beating a polygraph?

283
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,300
Chuck, wait.

284
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,000
What? Ch...?

285
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh, duh, yeah... 
(chuckles)

286
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,100
Can I get my
sister's ring back?

287
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,100
You guys are pretty
damn thorough.

288
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,500
You should be more concerned
about not making it

289
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,800
to her wedding.
Can I talk to you for a second?

290
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,900
Hold on.

291
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,800
He can't hear it like that.
He won't process it.

292
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,700
How do you give a man
a life sentence

293
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,700
just for being
a good guy?

294
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,300
Okay, how about I
give it a try, gently?

295
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,100
No, I don't want to hear
your version of it

296
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,900
and neither does he.
It's a job.

297
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,000
How come you always
got to get your lady
feelings involved...?

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,500
It has nothing to do...
Agent Walker, Major Casey.

299
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,900
You might want to take
a look at this.

300
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,700
This is a surveillance tape

301
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,800
taken during
the robbery.

302
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,200
CASEY:
There's nothing there.

303
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,100
Bad guy disabled
the security system.
Wait.

304
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,000
CHUCK:
Hey, that's Jeff and Lester.

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,800
And they are apparently drunk.

306
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,600
 It appears they've mistakenly
turned the camera back on.

307
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,300
Hang on a second--
who's that?

308
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
SARAH:
That's the spy.

309
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
He's the spy who
spies on spies.

310
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,500
CHUCK:
Why would a Fulcrum agent
try to steal Big Mike's fish?

311
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,500
CASEY:
Those two dilweeds
interrupted an actual

312
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,300
robbery in progress.

313
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,600
The receiver's in the fish.

314
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,100
 Marlin, actually.
Technically,
it's a marlin.

315
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,200
Marlin.
You would call it a
marlin, right? Yeah.

316
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,800
Look.

317
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,300
See, there you go-- done.

318
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,400
My job here is done.

319
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,500
So now I'm sure you
super-agents can figure out

320
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,700
where the two
drunken pinheads

321
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,800
stashed the fish-- marlin,
four-foot marlin.

322
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,300
I'm going to stick
around here and try

323
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,200
and find my
sister's ring.

324
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,800
Hey, Chuck?

325
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,300
Chuck, no ring came up
in our inventory.

326
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,100
What do you mean no ring
came up in your inventory?

327
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,400
You guys robbed the Buy More,
didn't you?

328
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,900
What happened to Awesome's
great-grandmother's ring?

329
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,300
We kind of have some bigger-
picture concerns right now.

330
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,300
What could be possibly be bigger
than me ruining the chances

331
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
of my sister
getting married?

332
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,700
The receiver
may contain information

333
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,900
indicating that
you're the Intersect.

334
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,000
Say it.

335
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Say what you're not saying.

336
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,000
If we don't locate the receiver
in the next 24 hours...

337
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,200
You'll be stored in an
underground bunker for so long

338
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,700
you'll forget what fresh air
smells like.

339
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,100
LESTER & JEFFREY:
One, two, three, four.

340
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,700
I declare a thumb war!

341
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,800
Oh! Come on,
Jeffrey.

342
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,700
Jeff, Lester, we got
to talk, it's important.

343
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,400
Yeah, see, this is
your problem, Charlie.

344
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,100
Why is your time
more valuable than mine? 

345
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,200
Oh! He is taking
him over the top!

346
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,700
All right.
Ow! My thumb!

347
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,900
Hey. Let's go.

348
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,500
(fake coughing):
Narc. Narc, Narc. Narc. Narc.

349
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,100
JEFFREY:
Easy on the shirt, Narc.

350
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,200
Where's the fish?

351
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,000
Fish? What fish?

352
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,300
Okay, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

353
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,400
Easy way is I shove
his foot up your ass.

354
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,800
What's the hard way?

355
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,100
I use my foot.

356
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,600
 CHUCK:
Look, we've seen the
surveillance footage, guys.

357
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,400
Okay? We know you were here
last night.

358
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,500
Yeah, right.
Yeah, no,
you two geniuses

359
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,900
thought you were
turning the cameras off,

360
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,800
but, instead,
you turned them back on.

361
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,900
We won't say anything
to Big Mike, I promise.

362
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,000
 Okay.

363
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,700
Come on, wh-what's
happening?

364
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,000
Charles, would you give us
a few minutes, please?

365
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Chuck...?

366
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,100
It was his idea.
What?!

367
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,000
The whole reason we snuck in
was to get your alcoholic ass

368
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,400
another drink-- you
were getting the shakes.

369
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,200
Not cool.
It's a disease.

370
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,000
You're a disease,
and you've diseased us all--

371
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,900
me, Chuck, this guy.

372
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,000
C-Calm down. Calm down.
Okay.

373
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,700
Look, Jeff, I totally

374
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,300
understand your plight.

375
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,600
We sympathize
with you, okay?

376
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,500
And we don't judge.

377
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,100
Just tell us

378
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,500
what exactly happened?

379
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,200
We were across
the street at Bennigan's

380
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,300
and I got
cut off again...
Jeff.

381
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,900
If you're going
to tell the story,

382
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,200
please...
don't butcher it.

383
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,200
We were at Benni's, enjoying
the deep-fried sampler,

384
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,200
 <i>and we decided</i>
 <i>to come back to the store</i>

385
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,100
 <i>for a nightcap in boss man's</i>
 <i>private stash.</i>

386
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,300
It's off.
(groans)

387
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,900
Rock and roll.

388
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,000
We have the store
to ourselves.

389
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,100
We should take off
all our clothes.

390
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,900
Don't make me uncomfortable
to be alone with you.

391
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,700
 Go get it.

392
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,000
Bingo.

393
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yes.
No.

394
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
No, no, no.

395
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,900
Jeffrey!
It's a wasted mission now.

396
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
It's a wasted mission.

397
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,500
We've gotta do something
exciting while we're here, man.

398
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,900
We can burn it down.

399
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,700
I was thinking more along
the lines of a...

400
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,200
fishing expedition.

401
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,200
And that, friends...

402
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,400
is the story
of the missing marlin.

403
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,900
And where is the marlin now?

404
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,600
I'm afraid I'm going to need
a little compensation.

405
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,400
(cries out)

406
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,200
At Chuck's!
We took it to Chuck's pad!

407
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,400
What? My apartment? Why?

408
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
We didn't want to get busted
with Big Mike's fish.

409
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,100
LESTER:
I'm going to
need lotion.

410
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,000
SARAH:
We're pursuing the receiver.

411
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We've got the location,

412
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,700
and it shouldn't be long
before recovery.

413
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,300
Stay with the receiver.

414
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,000
In the meantime we've decided

415
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,300
to extract Chuck.

416
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,500
What? But we don't know
he's in danger.

417
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,000
There's a chance
the identity of the Intersect

418
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
has been compromised.

419
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,800
We have to err
on the side of caution.

420
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,200
You promised we had 48 hours.

421
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,900
You know the game, Agent Walker.

422
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,800
The order has gone out.

423
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,500
Chuck is coming in.

424
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,400
Come on.

425
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,000
Chuck, you're looking
for a marlin.

426
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,100
Hey, hey, whoa.

427
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,700
Whoa, stop, stop.
I seriously doubt

428
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,800
that these geniuses
had time

429
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
to reupholster the couch.

430
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,900
It's got to be here somewhere.

431
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
Chuck?

432
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,500
Hey, sis.

433
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,000
John.

434
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,900
Hi.

435
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,100
What are you two up to?

436
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,200
What's going on
with the apartment?

437
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,800
I'll clean it up later.
Right now, we're
looking for something.

438
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,500
What is it?
Look, I-I promise you

439
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,100
whatever you want to talk
about is not as important

440
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,600
as what we're looking
for right now.
Okay.

441
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,700
What are you looking for?

442
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,800
A stuffed fish.

443
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,000
A fish?

444
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,700
Marlin, actually,
about four feet long.

445
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,200
Got a spear-like nose.
And a mouth. Yeah.

446
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,000
Okay, Chuck, I get it.

447
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,300
 Besides, if anything
 <i>really</i> important

448
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,500
were going on,
you have plenty of people

449
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,700
in your life you can
talk to about it.

450
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,800
Hey, Ellie, wait.

451
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,500
What?

452
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,300
Oh!

453
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,700
I love you.

454
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,500
Just in case.

455
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Just in case of what?

456
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,400
Uh....

457
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,100
Just-just in case
I can't find the fish.

458
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,300
I suppose you haven't
talked to Morgan.

459
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,700
No. Why?

460
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,100
Because he left here last night
with a four-foot long marlin.

461
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,600
He's mine.

462
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,100
And you know nothing about
the stolen merchandise?

463
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,100
No, sir. Officer. Detective.

464
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,600
Where's my fish, Grimes?

465
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,700
Mr. Tucker, please.

466
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,200
The merchandise is insured.

467
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,900
That fish cost me 200 bucks
on eBay.

468
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,800
Wait, you bought that fish?

469
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That will be
all, Mr. Grimes.

470
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,100
What did you use
for bait, PayPal?

471
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,900
CONWAY:
Grimes, out!

472
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,600
All right. Yes, sir.

473
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,500
You cracked,
didn't you?

474
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,400
LESTER:
You are so weak.

475
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,600
JEFFREY:
You are so weak, man.

476
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,500
How am I weak, dude?
I didn't say anything.

477
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,400
In fact, I told...
How am I supposed
to believe that?

478
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,100
Bartowski! You're up.

479
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100
I got the scraggly troll.

480
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
I-I did not rob the store.

481
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,400
Did I ask you that?

482
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,600
Already he's talking
about stolen goods.

483
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
You might as well come out
and admit you did it.
Please.

484
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,800
Let me handle
the investigation.

485
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,900
Now, Mr. Bartowski,

486
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,300
we believe
this was an inside job.

487
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,500
None of these other imbeciles
could even tie their shoes

488
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,600
without Bartowski's say-so.

489
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
If there's a ringleader,
you're looking at him.

490
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,400
Where's my fish, Bartowski?!

491
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,300
Okay, start talking.

492
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
From the beginning.

493
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,000
Okay.

494
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,100
Um... I was born
a Cesarean section.

495
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,300
And I always felt
like I was robbed

496
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,200
of that headlong voyage
through the uterine canal.

497
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,600
Where's the marlin, moron?

498
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,400
Ah, the elusive fish. Sure.

499
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,200
That's a tale for the ages.

500
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,400
Start talking or I'll pull
each and every one

501
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
of these hairs out of
your face, one at a time,

502
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,100
starting with this one.
(groans)

503
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,100
Torture?

504
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,800
Hey, if you're trying
to get me to talk,

505
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
you are using
the wrong tactic, brother.

506
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,900
Really?

507
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,300
What's the right tactic?

508
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,600
My own personal kryptonite:

509
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Grape soda.

510
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,700
On the rocks, please.

511
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,200
Conway.

512
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,600
Excuse me, I have
to take this.

513
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,800
I got this.

514
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,500
Ah.

515
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,500
You don't want to talk,
Bartowski?

516
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,700
We'll just have to turn the heat
up on you.

517
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,900
Mm-hmm.

518
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,800
There we go.

519
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,900
Ah. Proper.

520
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,400
So, it all started with
"The Next Call of Duty" game...

521
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,200
 <i>Now, I don't really</i>
 <i>consider it stealing,</i>

522
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,300
 <i>since I see Chuck and I</i>
 <i>as being life partners</i>

523
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,300
 <i>and therefore,</i>
 <i>community property.</i>

524
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,600
 <i>Using my own personal entrance,</i>

525
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,900
 <i>I went into Chuck's room</i>
 <i>to play the game.</i>

526
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Yessss!

527
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
 <i>And when I reached</i>
 <i>into the bag, I discovered a...</i>

528
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,900
 <i>I found a, uh...</i>

529
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,900
I can't go on.

530
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,000
This is just getting
a little personal.

531
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
All right, new tactic:

532
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,100
You finish the story
or I put your head
through the wall.

533
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,800
Okay, someone wasn't hugged
enough as a child.

534
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,900
Ugh.

535
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,400
That's horrible.

536
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
It's better on the rocks,
that's why I told you to...

537
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,000
Anyway, there I was...

538
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,200
 <i>staring at the most horrific</i>
 <i>object the world has ever seen.</i>

539
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,100
Noooooo!

540
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,100
What?

541
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,900
Morgan, you scared me

542
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,100
to death!
What is wrong with you?

543
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100
No, no,

544
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,900
no, no, no...
no, it's Chuck.

545
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,100
Well, what is it?
What happened?

546
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,000
We've lost him, Ell.

547
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,500
We've lost him
forever.

548
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,400
You better sit down.

549
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,300
Um...

550
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't know how
to say this.

551
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,300
He's gone.

552
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,000
Morgan, what are you
talking about?

553
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,200
I'm talking about this.

554
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,400
Chuck's going to
propose to Sarah.

555
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,900
 <i>And that's pretty much</i>
 <i>the whole story.</i>

556
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,500
More or less.

557
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,200
Ellie and I bonded
over the fact that,

558
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,500
you know, he didn't include us
in this life decision.

559
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,000
But, hey, who cares, you know,
he's got you now, so...

560
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,900
What does that have
to do with the fish?

561
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,200
F-Fish? Who cares
about the fish?

562
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,700
John, Chuck's getting married!

563
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,300
Pitas are here.

564
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,800
Hey.
Hey.

565
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,500
You've had 29 deliveries,

566
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,200
so I dropped in
your free baba ganoush.

567
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,000
Really?
29 deliveries.
Uh-huh.

568
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,800
29 bugs.

569
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,000
Wait a second.

570
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Oh, lunch!

571
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,600
Thank you.

572
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,200
Ooh!

573
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Hey, buddy.
I-I smell falafel.

574
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,300
Yeah, of course
you do.

575
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,100
What do you got?
I got the chick...

576
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,700
I'm just going to,
let me just have a...
No, no.

577
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,000
You're going to
finish the story.

578
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,300
Back to the story.

579
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Ooh!

580
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,000
Come on.

581
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,500
"Boobies."

582
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,400
Jackpot.

583
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Gotcha!

584
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,200
Good thing Jeff
and Lester are pervs.

585
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,300
I can see you're sweating it.

586
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,700
So...

587
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,400
you ready to tell us what
happened here last night?

588
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
 I'm telling you guys,
I have no idea.

589
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,300
Fine.

590
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,400
There's other ways
to make you talk.

591
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,100
Time to send you back
to gen pop.

592
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,900
He sung like a canary!

593
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,300
Thanks for the
info, Chuck.

594
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,100
John Casey! You're next!

595
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
One sec.

596
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,600
What? Can't fit the police

597
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,700
into your social schedule?

598
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,700
Get in here now,

599
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,800
or you and I are taking
a trip downtown!

600
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,400
If you have a second,
Mr. Casey,

601
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,800
we'd appreciate it.

602
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,200
LESTER:
I can't believe
you told Casey

603
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
you put the marlin
in Chuck's room.

604
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,400
What?

605
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,900
Don't worry.
I moved it

606
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,500
into the freezer at
the Wienerlicious.

607
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,800
Wow, I'm impressed
with you.

608
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Thank you.
Bye.

609
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,100
What? Where you going?

610
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,800
Where you going? Where
you going, Lizzie?

611
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,400
Lizzie? Where's she going?

612
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,200
Can I help you?
Yeah.

613
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,400
I was wondering

614
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,800
if I could get something
out of your freezer.

615
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,400
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

616
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,000
It's company policy.

617
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
The kitchen is usually off-
limits for non-employees.

618
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,500
Okay, then I'll have to use
my special pass...

619
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,200
You're no hot dog maker.

620
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,200
Bring it on, pita girl.

621
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,600
We're closed!
We're closed!

622
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,000
Where's the fish?

623
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,800
We need to talk.
It's an emergency.

624
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,100
Oh, listen, no, hey,

625
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,700
hey, hey, Chuck, Chuck,
it's okay, man, I know

626
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,800
about you and Sarah.

627
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,300
Man, and how she's more
than just your girlfriend.

628
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
What?

629
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,800
Morgan, stay.

630
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,100
But I...
Sta... stay!

631
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,900
Hello.

632
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,600
After careful consideration
of all potential proposals,

633
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,000
I have made a decision.

634
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,700
Oh, let me guess: Naked 2K run?

635
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,100
Dinner, Chuck.

636
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,200
Romantic, candlelit dinner,

637
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,100
just the two of us.

638
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,600
The coup de grce...
Wow. Good.

639
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,300
molten lava cake with a
two-carat diamond ring filling.

640
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,000
Ellie will really
love that.

641
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,000
Look, Devon,
just-just promise me

642
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,200
that you'll take care
of my sister

643
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,700
if anything were to happen.

644
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,600
What's gonna happen?

645
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Oh, hey,

646
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,100
cake hits the oven in two hours.
Don't be late.

647
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,400
What am I gonna do?

648
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,900
Do nothing.

649
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,700
You haven't given Sarah
the ring yet.

650
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,200
Dude, there's plenty of time
to call this whole thing off.

651
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
Sarah? Ring?

652
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,800
Yeah, the ring
you got Sarah.

653
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,100
The one I kind of took
out of your locker.

654
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,800
You mean...

655
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,900
the ring that Awesome
got for Ellie.

656
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,100
Oh, thank God, man.
Are you kidding?

657
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,200
I thought I lost you, pal!

658
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,100
Morgan... where is the ring?

659
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,700
It's kind of
complicated but...

660
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,800
It's in the freezer
at the Wienerlicious.

661
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,000
I put it in
Big Mike's marlin and I...

662
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,800
I was gonna put it back.

663
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,200
Ow!

664
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,800
Slide it to me.

665
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,400
Now!

666
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,500
Hey!

667
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,900
Hi, S...

668
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,900
No...

669
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,600
No, no!

670
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,000
No, no, no, no, no.

671
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,500
No, no, no, no, no, no!

672
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,300
(distant):
Help!

673
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,800
Sarah?

674
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,100
Lizzie's the mole.
She got the receiver, Chuck.

675
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,900
Oh, my God, Sarah, it's over.
They're gonna stick me

676
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,900
in some tiny cell
with no windows.

677
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,200
Okay, Chuck,
I need you to focus.

678
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
We can get Lizzie
if you can get me out of here.

679
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
How?

680
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,700
I keep a backup piece

681
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,600
in the jar of horseradish sauce.

682
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,100
Horseradish?

683
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,100
Who-Who-Who puts horseradish
on hot dogs?

684
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,200
Chuck!
Got it. Right.

685
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,500
Hide it someplace nobody
would look-- good.

686
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,600
Great. Okay.

687
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,500
Oh! Whoa.

688
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,300
I got it. Okay.

689
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,700
Okay, now shoot
the lock.

690
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,400
Um, look, Sarah,

691
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,600
I've never really fired
a gun before, okay?

692
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,800
And I've actually
done this on purpose

693
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,200
to avoid any unpleasant
side effects

694
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
like shooting myself
or others.

695
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,300
Just shoot the lock

696
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,400
or I will shoot you
when I get out of here!

697
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,500
(gasping):
Okay.

698
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,500
Get back. Ready?
Ready? Get back.

699
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,300
One...

700
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,100
Two...

701
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,400
Take the safety
off first.

702
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,200
One, one sec...
just a little problem.

703
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,500
CONWAY:
Bartowski, Big Mike told me
I'd find you here.

704
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,600
Drop the gun, Bartowski!
Now!

705
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,900
No, no, no,
no need to shoot.

706
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,600
It's not my gun, it's not
my gun-- my girlfriend

707
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,200
is locked in the freezer,
and if you let her out

708
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,600
she can explain
everything.
Okay, let's go.

709
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,500
She's right...
Come on, move.

710
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,100
Okay, okay.

711
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,200
Just look in...
Nice try.

712
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,500
Go, go, go!
Look in the freezer, please!

713
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,800
Just look in the freezer.
She's right there.

714
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,500
You're taking this thing
a little seriously.

715
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,800
What kind of
cop are you?

716
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,300
Where's Big Mike's fish?

717
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,700
What are you now, huh?

718
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,200
Big Man's personal Gestapo?

719
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,700
Come on, you can't
break me, fool.

720
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,800
At the Wienerlicious.

721
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,600
SARAH:
Help!

722
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,100
Sarah.

723
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,400
Stand back.

724
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,200
The delivery girl
is the mole.

725
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,000
The detective took Chuck.

726
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Where are you, Chuck?

727
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,500
I need the ring.

728
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,300
This is not awesome.

729
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,800
MAN:
And the package, HQ.

730
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,100
This is Long Shore.

731
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,100
You're not a cop.

732
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,100
We've identified
the enemy agent.

733
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,700
She was posing
as a Pita Parlour

734
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,500
delivery girl.

735
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Code name Lizzie.

736
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,500
BECKMAN:
So she escaped
with the receiver?

737
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,700
Yes, but she made a phone call.

738
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,400
We're currently tracing
the cell signature,

739
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,000
and we can triangulate
her location.

740
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,900
We just need more time.

741
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,200
GRAHAM:
As soon as you locate her,

742
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
take her out.

743
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,600
Uh, one of us
needs to go

744
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,100
and get Chuck out
of police custody.

745
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,500
He was arrested just...
BECKMAN:
The Intersect

746
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,700
is no longer your concern,
Agent Walker.

747
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,400
I... I don't understand.

748
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,700
BECKMAN:
Detective Conway is CIA.

749
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,800
GRAHAM:
Chuck is on his way

750
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,000
to the extraction
point right now.

751
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,900
We've decided to transfer him
to lockdown immediately.

752
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,800
Is there a problem?

753
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,900
Uh, no.

754
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,700
No. I just thought
I would handle his transfer.

755
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,600
Forget about Chuck,
Agent Walker.

756
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,400
Focus on catching
that FULCRUM agent.

757
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,300
We're on it.

758
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,500
We, meaning,

759
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,700
I go get Lizzie
while you find Chuck.

760
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,900
Well, don't make me
change my mind.

761
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,100
So...

762
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,200
this is it, huh?

763
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,600
Going to get my own padded cell.

764
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,700
Do I get a bed, or is

765
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,000
my whole room
kind of like a bed?

766
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,800
It's not as bad as it sounds.

767
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,100
The underground complex

768
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,000
where you
will be living

769
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,700
has state-of-the-art
security and amenities.

770
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,400
You'll even be allowed outside
to visit controlled locations.

771
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,300
Hold on.

772
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,300
I-I... I can't leave
without telling Ellie something,

773
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,100
a reason for going.

774
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,900
What should I say?

775
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,800
Nothing.

776
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,300
It's safer for them
if you just... disappear.

777
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,200
CONWAY:
 <i>Asset is ready for extraction.</i>

778
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,500
 <i>Send in the chopper.</i>

779
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,800
Long Shore!

780
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,000
Is there a problem,
Agent Walker?
Sarah,

781
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
thank God you're here.
Listen, I-I don't...

782
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,200
I don't want
to go yet. I...

783
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,800
It's okay, Chuck. Agent Casey

784
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,700
is tracking the
FULCRUM mole.

785
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,100
He should have her
in custody soon,

786
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,100
so we can hold off

787
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,400
on the Chuck transfer
for the time being.

788
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,500
If there was a change
in the operation,

789
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,700
I would have been contacted.
I have my orders.

790
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,500
We don't have to do this.
This is a judgment call.

791
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,300
Okay, we can just hold Chuck
here until we know for sure.

792
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,700
His cover was blown.
He's gone.

793
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,600
No. I will take
full responsibility.

794
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,200
Chuck is my asset;
he's my guy.

795
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Just... Just give us
more time, please.

796
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,800
CHUCK:
I'd appreciate it.

797
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,900
I really would.

798
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,600
Please don't do this.

799
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,000
CONWAY:
Okay.

800
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,300
You've got one minute.

801
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,300
One minute.

802
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
I'm not ready, Sarah.

803
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,300
I'm not ready
to disappear.

804
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,100
No. I know,
I know.

805
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,500
I need you to talk to Ellie

806
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
and to Morgan and my friends,

807
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,300
and-and-
and-and tell 'em...

808
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,600
I don't know. I...

809
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,100
Look, if I'm supposed
to be dead, just say something

810
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,900
that will make it okay,

811
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,300
that will make 'em
feel all right.

812
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,200
Just make sure they know
how much I love 'em.

813
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,100
You can do that, right?

814
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,600
Course you can. You're Sarah.
You can do anything.

815
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,500
And, hey, there's a silver
lining to this, too, you know,

816
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,500
'cause we're not working
together anymore,

817
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,700
which means,
we can go on a date.

818
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,600
You can come by my cell,
and we can hang out,

819
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
and you can tell me
who the president is.

820
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,400
And maybe, uh...

821
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,700
...maybe we can see
how we really feel.

822
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,500
Time's up.

823
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,700
Good-bye, Sarah.

824
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,300
Chuck?

825
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,000
I'll save you later.

826
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,100
(gunshot)
Oh!

827
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,700
Oh!
Chuck, get down.

828
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,300
(gunshot)

829
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,500
Go, go, go!

830
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,000
I listened to the receiver.

831
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,500
BOTH:
She knows.

832
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,200
Do you know
how many agents are looking

833
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,100
for Bryce Larkin?

834
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,700
And all this time,

835
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,200
the Intersect was here.

836
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,300
Wait till
I tell my superiors that.

837
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,400
Okay, look, what if
I surrender, and you run?

838
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,800
I mean, I'm going
in a cell anyway.

839
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,200
What's the difference?
Torture.

840
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,700
Okay, no surrender.

841
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,600
I only have one question, Chuck.

842
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,800
Who's the ring for?

843
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,800
She has Ellie's
engagement ring?

844
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,600
Try to distract her.

845
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,700
What?! How?

846
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,700
Chuck, I'm not gonna
to go away.

847
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,900
Okay... okay,
look, look, look.

848
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,500
You really... You really
want to take me in?

849
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
You're going to have
to sweeten the deal
a little bit for me.

850
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Uh, look.

851
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,300
Look, the CIA--

852
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,600
they're offering me a nice
padded cell, real cush.

853
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,400
Can you beat that?

854
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,800
I'm a guy who enjoys
a... a good steam.

855
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,500
Can you do...?

856
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,400
Can you do maybe a
steam room or something?

857
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,600
I don't think you're really
in a position to bargain, Chuck.

858
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,100
I have two guns.

859
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,400
What do you have?

860
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,600
Me.

861
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,900
Don't break the ring.

862
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,100
Whoa!

863
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Oh! Oh!

864
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,400
Hey! Bartowski,
get out of the way.

865
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
There's really
some serious spy
fighting going on.

866
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
CASEY:
Get down, Bartowski.

867
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,500
Sarah!
(grunts)

868
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,100
I had a feeling
that girl was dirty.

869
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,800
Norman.

870
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,500
The power of positive thinking.

871
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,900
This was an amazing night.

872
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,600
As it always is with...

873
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,500
But, sometimes, I know life
isn't always awesome.

874
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
What I'm trying to say is that,
when things get rough,

875
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,700
 <i>I want to face them together,</i>
 <i>the good times and the bad..</i>

876
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,100
Oh! Oh! Oh!

877
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Ladies' feminine products.

878
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,400
That's not good.
That's not good.

879
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,200
Are you, uh...

880
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,700
Are you sure tAre yo

881
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,100
Are you sure that Lizzie
didn't have the ring on her?

882
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,800
When they took her away,
all she had was the receiver.

883
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,500
Oh, then it's got
to be here somewhere.

884
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,400
You know, Chuck, if
we can't find it, we
can just replace it.

885
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,700
Look, look, look, it-it was
Awesome's great-granny's ring,

886
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,300
and it's going
to be my sister's, okay?

887
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,700
Even if its covered in coffee
grounds and miscellaneous DNA.

888
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,400
I have a ring, I have
the blessing of your brother.

889
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,300
Will you do me the honor
of becoming my wife,

890
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,700
Eleanor Faye Bartowski?

891
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,700
CAPTAIN:
 <i>Ooh. Almost woke her up.</i>

892
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,200
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

893
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,300
Ah! Hey!

894
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,100
Oh, I found it!

895
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,100
 <i>Let's go.</i>

896
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,700
I'm so sorry...

897
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,000
but it might be
a little dirty.

898
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,300
Way to go, Chuck.

899
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,300
I always knew you could
handle my family jewels.

900
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,300
So to speak.

901
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,200
Uh, when she's sleeping
really hard like that,

902
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,100
sometimes, if you pinch
her nose, it'll wake...

903
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,500
Right.

904
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,200
I'm going to...
Oh, okay.

905
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,700
Mission accomplished.

906
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,700
I can't believe
we pulled it off.

907
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,300
That'll make one hell
of a story at their wedding.

908
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,900
Which I'm never allowed

909
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,600
to talk about under fear
of death-- understood.

910
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,400
I have other material.

911
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,500
You want to?

912
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,600
What, spy? You?

913
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,800
She looks so happy.

914
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,900
Yeah, she does.

915
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,700
I couldn't
leave them yet.

916
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,000
You don't have
to worry about that.

917
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,700
You're safe.

918
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,300
Yeah, safe for now,
though. Right.

919
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,100
I mean... they keep
getting closer.

920
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,100
Eventually, they're going
to figure out who I am.

921
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,300
Don't you think you should
go in and congratulate Ellie?

922
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,000
You want to
come in with me?

923
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,800
Oh, it's family time.

924
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,300
I know.

925
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,700
Well, good night.

926
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,200
CHUCK (laughing):
Hey!

927
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,200
Hey, buddy.
Yeah.

928
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,400
Hmm.

929
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,400
We can only keep him here
for so long.

930
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,300
You realize that,
don't you?

931
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,200
I love you,
sweetie.
I love you.

932
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,600
I'm sorry I had to keep it
a secret for a little while.

933
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
