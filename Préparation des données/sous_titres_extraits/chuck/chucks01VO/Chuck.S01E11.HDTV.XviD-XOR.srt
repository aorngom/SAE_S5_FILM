1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,365
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.</i>

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,800
<i>Here's a few things that
you might need to know.</i>

3
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:04,200
It was nice knowing you.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,365
Oh, my God. Bryce.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,600
How the hell are you still alive?

6
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:11,665
It's complicated.

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,200
You're still in love with me.

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,500
I guess this means we're
not getting back together.

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,465
We'll always have Omaha.

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,465
what did bryce mean by omaha?

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,800
Probably a code. Contact
point of some sort.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,200
<i>Bryce is going deep, Chuck.
No calls home, no messages out.</i>

13
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,700
<i>If Sarah wants to join up
with him, she has to do it now.</i>

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,200
What... what is that?

15
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:00,600
What's that wiggly thing?

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,200
What did I even bet on?

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,300
Gimel! I win.

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,000
- Aw...
- You sure?

19
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:07,800
Yes. Yes.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,600
Gimel beats high. Pay up, buddy.

21
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,665
I thought high was the best.

22
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,265
Yes, I know you think so, but, Anna,

23
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,065
this is the Parcheesi
of my people, all right?

24
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,400
Don't question my spirituality.
Now hand over the cash.

25
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:20,300
I apologize...

26
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,900
Decided to take up bird watching?

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,600
Just breathing in the view.

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,800
I know that grunt.

29
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,500
Yeah, that's the number seven, right?

30
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:45,100
Skeptical with a side of cynicism.

31
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:46,700
Just clearing my throat.

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,765
Also couldn't help but notice,

33
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Agent Walker's car
isn't in her usual spot.

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,565
Oh... I didn't, uh...

35
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,000
It's weird, I didn't even notice.

36
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:56,400
I didn't even see that, at all.

37
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,300
Fine. Maybe I did.

38
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,865
So, have you talked to Sarah lately?

39
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,900
Agent Walker and I don't do a
lot of fraternizing off hours.

40
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,600
Guess we'll just have to see.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,600
See... See what...
what-what... See what?

42
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,800
See if she's had enough of
the good life here with you.

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,565
See if she's hightailed it

44
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,100
to wherever your buddy
Bryce is hiding himself.

45
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,600
Is that, uh, is that an option?

46
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:21,300
Oh, don't worry.

47
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,000
I hear there's a great
selection of new handlers

48
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:26,200
in this year's CIA Christmas catalogue.

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,100
Are there? Thanks a lot.

50
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,300
She's a liar, not to be trusted.

51
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:33,500
- What's that?
- Women.

52
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,565
Man, they're so elusive, so unknowable.

53
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,865
Okay, they wrap you in
this wool sweater of lies

54
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,200
and it keeps you warm, but
it makes your neck all itchy.

55
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:41,967
Who-Who are we talking about exactly?

56
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:43,700
Anna. And by the way,
never trust a woman

57
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:45,467
who's name is a palindrome, okay?

58
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:47,165
Uh, how do you know she's a liar?

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,000
I waited outside her house
last night, in the bushes.

60
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,700
I saw her get picked up to go out,

61
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,500
then dropped off exactly three
hours and 24 minutes later.

62
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:54,800
She's cheating on me.

63
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,565
My Anna Banana is cheating on me.

64
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,400
- In the bushes?
- I brought a sandwich.

65
00:02:58,435 --> 00:02:59,300
Oh...

66
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,865
Listen, she's lying to me, okay?

67
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,200
And a relationship is
built on trust, Chuck.

68
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,000
Sex and trust, am I right?

69
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,865
Yeah, yeah
- two big prerequisites, I guess.

70
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,300
What's cool is you and Sarah
are so pure and simple, you know?

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,300
You ever wish you were born
like a dog or a dolphin?

72
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,000
Or Dr. Dre?

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,400
Who's cheating on Dre, man?

74
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,500
Chuckster.

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,500
Uh, we got an install job
over at Marina Del Rey.

76
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:27,465
Okay. Well, go with God, fellas.

77
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,965
No, no, no. Big Mike says
you have to come with us,

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,400
'cause you know that Jeff's not to be
left unsupervised around the holidays.

79
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:35,000
Do you want to try my eggnog?

80
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,465
- No.
- I'm sorry, fellas.

81
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,000
Is it okay if you guys go
by yourself, okay? 'Cause...

82
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,065
Anna's cheating on me.

83
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,600
Ouch. Who's the lucky guy?

84
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,465
Maybe it's not another guy.

85
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,100
Okay, let's strap on our life
jackets and hit the Marina.

86
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,500
See, that's why I've sworn off women.

87
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,000
How'd you like to be that guy right now,

88
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:52,600
all heartbroken over a lady?

89
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,000
Bitches ain't nothing
but tricks and hos.

90
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,200
You said it, bubeleh.

91
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,600
Okay. Well, the system checks
out and everything's on line.

92
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:36,865
Most onboard functions are

93
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,100
now controllable from
anywhere on the boat.

94
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:40,100
Nice ship.

95
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,300
<i>It reminds me of the Pacific Princess.</i>

96
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,700
- I'm not familiar.
- Oh, really?

97
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,200
<i>The LoveBoat
- he's referring to The LoveBoat. Shh! Chuck, please!</i>

98
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:47,165
shh, chuck, please.

99
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,450
You got a head on board?

100
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:49,665
I've had a lot of eggnog.

101
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,565
Yeah, which you should've
left at home, Jeff.

102
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
You know, not every boat you
get on is a booze cruise, buddy.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The bathroom is not in there.

104
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:56,017
Nobody downstairs!

105
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:56,965
No, Jeff, wait...

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
- Hey!
- back, jeff, no.

107
00:04:58,035 --> 00:04:58,867
Whoa!

108
00:04:58,902 --> 00:04:59,665
Jackpot!

109
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,500
Please, get out. Get out!

110
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:02,665
Go! Go! Go!

111
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,300
Watch this step. Watch the what? Oh.

112
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,065
- What's with all the cash?
- Move.

113
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,200
- Easy, sister...
- I'm not your sister.

114
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,200
They're counting money raised
for Mr. Kirk's aid organization,

115
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:12,317
from a charity event.

116
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:13,400
Kirk? As in the captain?

117
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,865
Lon Kirk, the man who owns this boat.

118
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,900
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Lon Kirk
- he's a billionaire.

119
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:20,200
He owns a country somewhere,
or something, right?

120
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,900
Incoming.

121
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Oh...

122
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,900
Ladies, I'm getting my sea legs.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,865
Okay, Jeff, Lester,

124
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,000
I think, uh, we should go now.

125
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:38,200
Sir, you dropped this...

126
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,600
They're fake.

127
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:49,265
Whatever.

128
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,800
So is Cool Whip.

129
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:52,265
Ahoy hoy.

130
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:59,800
CHUCK S01E11

131
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,400
<i>The serial numbers that Chuck flashed on</i>

132
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:30,465
are a strain of counterfeit currency

133
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
that Treasury has been
trying to crack for years.

134
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:34,400
But perhaps we should
wait to debrief you

135
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,517
until Agent Walker arrives.

136
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:38,600
Yes. Where is Agent Walker?

137
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,400
Uh, ma'am, Agent Walker is currently...

138
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,465
She, uh...

139
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,900
Agent Walker is currently
suffering from a spastic colon,

140
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:47,700
which acts up on her
from time to time, so...

141
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:49,500
She has no history of that.

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,100
Perhaps we should reschedule when
Agent Walker is feeling better.

143
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm fine. I'm sorry I'm late. Carry on.

144
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
As we were saying...

145
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,000
Lon Kirk now devotes
most of his time and money

146
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,750
to aid projects, mostly foreign.

147
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:03,300
And we think he's the source?

148
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:04,400
Not confirmed.

149
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,900
However, we have intel that
a major counterfeiter is

150
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:08,567
in Los Angeles trying to acquire

151
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,201
a new set of printing plates.

152
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:11,800
And how shall we proceed?

153
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,200
As far as Kirk is
concerned, very cautiously.

154
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,165
He's very well connected.

155
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
He's hosting a charity event tonight

156
00:07:18,235 --> 00:07:20,117
at the New Constellation Yacht Club.

157
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:22,000
Sarah and Chuck will go as guests.

158
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,400
Casey as staff.

159
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:24,500
One question:

160
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,300
Will Chuck and Sarah
be going as a couple?

161
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,800
Unless they have a problem.

162
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:29,900
No problem.

163
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,600
No problem.

164
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:34,500
Good luck then.

165
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,000
Hey, hey, Sarah. Wait.

166
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,600
What's up?

167
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:44,500
Um...

168
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,500
Nothing.

169
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,965
Nothing, really.

170
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,500
Just, you know, good
to, good to see you.

171
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Thought you'd be
halfway to Bryce by now.

172
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,200
Why would you think that?

173
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,200
I don't know, 'cause...

174
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,950
he offers a pretty
exciting life, I guess,

175
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:06,500
sipping Mai Tai's in
Jakarta, or... or...

176
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,065
assassinating Afghani warlords,

177
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
or whatever it is that
you kids do for fun.

178
00:08:11,135 --> 00:08:13,600
I'm here because I have a job to do.

179
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,400
Right.

180
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,800
Right. Of course, the job.

181
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
I better, uh, I better
get going as well.

182
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,700
I gotta punch in.

183
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,500
Sarah?

184
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,500
Yeah?

185
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,500
Should we, should we
carpool on our date tonight?

186
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,600
Be at my place at 8:00.

187
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
For those of you who are unaware,

188
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,900
this Friday is our annual
Buy More Christmas...

189
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:57,800
Hup!

190
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,865
<i>...holiday party,</i>

191
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,600
with respect to our Hebrew friends

192
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:08,300
and whatever else we have here.

193
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,100
So there's no confusion,

194
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,600
I'll go over the ground rules.

195
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,000
Rule number one:

196
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,200
Jeff, no spiking the eggnog.

197
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,400
- Can I bring my own?
- No!

198
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Rule number two: Jeff,
no holding the mistletoe

199
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:28,000
over the women and copping a feel.

200
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,665
Uh, sir, hopefully,

201
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,100
if Jeff follows rule number one
- which I'm sure...

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,800
...he might do
- uh, then rule number two won't apply.

203
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,265
Good point.

204
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,800
Okay, who's bringing eats?

205
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Uh, I'll be making latkes.

206
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:45,065
What's that?

207
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,700
Um, the traditional Jewish pancake.

208
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,100
- They got 'tater in them?
- Yes.

209
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:53,400
- They fried?
- They are, sir.

210
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Good. Meeting adjourned!

211
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,700
We got to find out how to make latkes.

212
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,400
Hey, there you are.

213
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,465
You missed the meeting.

214
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,300
Jeff has to stay sober
and he can't grope women.

215
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,500
- I know the drill.
- Okay.

216
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,600
If you don't tell me what's up,

217
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,150
I'm going to tickle you until you pee.

218
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:19,100
Please... I don't, I don't want...

219
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:20,200
Cut it out. Stop it.

220
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,400
I know, okay.

221
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,950
You weren't home last night, Anna.

222
00:10:22,985 --> 00:10:24,265
You went out. I was in the bushes

223
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,600
at a stakeout with
my iPod and corn beef.

224
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,800
Yeah, I know, it's a little weird, okay?

225
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,200
But I saw you get picked up.

226
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm not an idiot, all right?

227
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,700
At least, not when it comes to this.

228
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,300
I'm sorry, Morgan.

229
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,000
I did lie.

230
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,500
Oh, my God...

231
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,400
I think I'm going to be nauseous.

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,600
But I'm not seeing someone else.

233
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,865
Please, I saw you get into
the guy's German luxury sedan.

234
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,500
It's bad enough that you're cheating, but
did it have to be with someone so successful?

235
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:55,500
Morgan...

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,600
my parents are in town.

237
00:10:57,635 --> 00:10:59,200
That was my dad's car.

238
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
Wait a minute, I thought
your parents lived in Taiwan.

239
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:02,965
They do... mostly.

240
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,400
They're just in town with a
bunch of Taiwanese government

241
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:07,900
muckety-mucks for a
charity thing in L.A.

242
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,500
Well, then, I'd like to
meet your parents, all right?

243
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,800
And I think if you're serious
about this relationship,

244
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:12,400
you should want me to meet them, too.

245
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Okay.

246
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Okay.

247
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,200
Hey!

248
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,765
Would you stop sneaking
up on me like that?

249
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,200
This is a retail store,
okay, buddy, not Tora Bora.

250
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:30,400
Oh, Sarah's got you all up in a tizzy.

251
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,600
Flush out your headgear, new guy.

252
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:33,665
We both know the Intersect

253
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,900
needs as much room up
there as we can get.

254
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:38,065
Okay, look, nothing is going on, okay?

255
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,800
Better not be. I need
your "A" game tonight.

256
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:40,900
Stay sharp.

257
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,700
Dude, I think I need your help here.

258
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:45,300
I think I made a horrible mistake.

259
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,800
What did you swallow this time?

260
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:48,400
No, no, it's worse. Worse.

261
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,065
Anna's parents are in town, right?

262
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,900
So I tell her, "Hey,
I'd like to meet them. "

263
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,100
So she goes, "Okay. "

264
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,600
Are you kidding me? What was I thinking?

265
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:56,200
My own parents don't even like me.

266
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,665
We're similar.

267
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,165
Morgan, Morgan, relax, buddy.

268
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,465
It's going to be fine. Just be yourself.

269
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,000
That's what Anna likes,
right? So will her parents.

270
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,065
Yeah.

271
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,700
- Right, you're right; that's what I'm going to do.
- Are you insane?

272
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,400
You can't be yourself.

273
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,700
You have to be better than yourself.

274
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:12,700
By, like, a factor of ten.

275
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,300
Or eleven.

276
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,400
I got to take it up a notch.

277
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:18,265
I got to step it up.

278
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,965
- Who should I be?
- Last I checked,

279
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
there were over, like, six
billion people on the planet.

280
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:23,500
Pick anyone.

281
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Should be an improvement.

282
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,600
lester, you shut up. morgan,

283
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:28,165
You, relax.

284
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,400
You're going to be fine.

285
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,200
Be myself.

286
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,200
Rock and roll.

287
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,400
I'm going to make a fool of myself.

288
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,800
It's open!

289
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,500
Not a morning person, I see.

290
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,700
Well, it depends on the morning.

291
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,165
So we're clear on everything?

292
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,900
Eyes and ears on anything
that can trigger a flash.

293
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,900
Our cover is that we're
a couple, you're...

294
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:13,067
Charles Carmichael.

295
00:13:13,102 --> 00:13:14,200
Yeah, I got it.

296
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,800
It should be pretty fun, right?

297
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,500
It's work.

298
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,700
That's okay. I got it.

299
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,400
Okay, well, uh...

300
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,700
ready to go to work?

301
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,000
If you're expecting me to hit
the tables tonight, I'm gonna need

302
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,500
a no-interest spy loan
or something like that.

303
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:51,867
You'd be shocked what a government

304
00:13:51,902 --> 00:13:53,165
super-computer pays these days.

305
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
The CIA staked us. You have a hundred.

306
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,100
Oh, well, that's ample.

307
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,100
Since when do you drink martinis?

308
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:00,165
Oh, oh, I don't, no.

309
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,600
But Carmichael loves them.

310
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,900
There he is. Let's go.

311
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,100
Ah! Roulette, eh?

312
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,800
My favorite game aside
from "Call of Duty. "

313
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Chips, please.

314
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,900
100, sir.

315
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,800
Good luck.

316
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,500
Don't lose it.

317
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,700
I don't believe we've
met before. I'm Lon Kirk.

318
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:25,700
I'm the host of this evening's event.

319
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,300
I know the people of Taiwan
are deeply appreciative

320
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,267
- of your generosity.
- Oh, well, cheers.

321
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,200
The name's Carmichael.
Charles Carmichael.

322
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:34,500
Pleasure, and your stunning...

323
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,500
...companion?

324
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,200
Sarah Walker. Pleasure.

325
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,500
- May I ask, Mr. Kirk...
- Lon, please.

326
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:44,465
Lon, I was wondering

327
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,000
how you came to focus your

328
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:47,465
charitable efforts on Taiwan.

329
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,950
Well, I started doing business there,

330
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:52,400
and I just fell in
love with the people-

331
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,200
their indefatigable spirit
- and I said to myself...

332
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:57,417
- Three and nine, please.
- Yes, sir.

333
00:14:57,452 --> 00:14:59,600
I said to myself, "Lon, you can help. "

334
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:00,900
That's wonderful.

335
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,365
And I always bet on red

336
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,565
because it reminds me of all

337
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,100
the pain and suffering in the world.

338
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:06,300
How noble.

339
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,400
- Any other
bets? - Mm-hmm!

340
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:09,600
Mm-hmm.

341
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,700
I'm in. All of it.

342
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,400
"Always bet on black. "

343
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,650
<i>Wesley Snipes, Passenger 57.</i>

344
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:19,165
Not a great film, granted.

345
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,900
You sure you want to risk it all, sir?

346
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,300
You might want to reconsider.

347
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:23,300
Doesn't seem prudent.

348
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:24,400
Prudent?

349
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,200
I mean, here I thought
we were gambling, right?

350
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:29,000
Plus, if I lose it, it
goes to charity anyway.

351
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:30,400
So here's to losing, right?

352
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
- Cheers.
- Bets are in.

353
00:15:31,635 --> 00:15:33,700
$100,000 on black.

354
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,565
What?! $100,000?

355
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800
Is that what you just said?

356
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,600
Uh, no, no, no, no, wait,
wait wait- I didn't realize-

357
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:42,800
it's a normal bet for me, $100,000.

358
00:15:42,835 --> 00:15:44,100
Come on, black.

359
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,600
Black, black, black, black.

360
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,200
Come on, honey, cheer for black.

361
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,900
Three, red.

362
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,000
Do you guys do mulligans in roulette?

363
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:55,667
Or any kind of a do-over?

364
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:57,300
Is there, like, a thing...

365
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,700
If you'll excuse me.

366
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,200
Did you really just wink at him?

367
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:07,700
Did you really just lose $100,000?

368
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:08,700
Psst.

369
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,165
Kirk is talking to Rashan Chen.

370
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,300
He's the Taiwanese Attaché|to
the Premier, he's dirty.

371
00:16:21,335 --> 00:16:22,600
They're using the charity as a front

372
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:24,300
to launder counterfeit money.

373
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,700
Okay, something's wrong.
I'm going to go over.

374
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,000
Chuck, you stay at the table.

375
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,000
We'll work on a payment plan later.

376
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,000
Can we.

377
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,400
She's being a little
obvious, don't you think?

378
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:47,400
Relax, Chuck, she's just doing her job.

379
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:49,400
So, uh, what did, uh...

380
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,765
what did you and Kirk talk about?

381
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,200
Uh, he invited me to his
yacht tomorrow afternoon.

382
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,800
Okay, what time should I be ready?

383
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,600
No, just me.

384
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,150
Oh, just, just you.

385
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:02,700
Alone on his yacht.

386
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,300
Kind of disrespectful to your
boyfriend, don't you think?

387
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:09,665
Chuck, Bryce is not my boyfriend.

388
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,200
And even if he was, he'd
understand this kind of work.

389
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,500
I meant Carmichael...

390
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,300
actually.

391
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,600
But don't worry, Carmichael's
booked up tomorrow anyway.

392
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,600
Very, very busy schedule, so...

393
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,700
good luck and...

394
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:28,600
good night.

395
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Nice car.

396
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,500
Not just any car.

397
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,600
It's a 1985 Crown Victoria.

398
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,165
But, like a lady,

399
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,300
she doesn't like it when
I talk about her age.

400
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:33,400
I'm not really a car
guy, so I don't really...

401
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,900
Pretty, pretty shiny, though.

402
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:36,200
Oh, yeah, she's shiny.

403
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,465
4.6 V8 engine,

404
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,165
hydra glide transmission,

405
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,500
reupholstered the
prisoner containment area.

406
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,865
Even installed a state of the art

407
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,200
GPS tracking system
in the license plate.

408
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,665
Can locate this baby anywhere

409
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,500
in the world in less than a minute.

410
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,565
It's great.

411
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,165
Th-that's really, Casey.

412
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,900
Could buy ten more just
like her with the money

413
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:55,665
you pissed away on one spin last night.

414
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,100
I knew you weren't going to let
that go. How did I know that?

415
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,365
So what, exactly, is Sarah's

416
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,200
mission on that guy's boat today?

417
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,700
Get close to Lon Kirk.

418
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,200
By any means necessary.

419
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,800
Wait, are...

420
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,400
You're saying she's going
to go down there and flirt

421
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,500
with Lon Kirk alone?

422
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,500
I mean, do you have any idea
what kind of message that gives?

423
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,000
Hmm... and I hear Agent
Walker can be quite the giver.

424
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,800
Do me a favor and keep it up front.

425
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,400
So, Morgan...

426
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,965
you work at Buy More?

427
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,600
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, that's correct.

428
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:58,167
And Anna will tell you that I got

429
00:19:58,202 --> 00:19:59,700
the old nose to the grindstone.

430
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,100
You know, not literally.

431
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,000
Of course, because that would hurt.

432
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,400
And is that where you see
yourself in say, five years?

433
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:07,700
That's a tough question.

434
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
I could tell you where I don't

435
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:11,600
want to see myself in five years:

436
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,900
prison, or under house arrest.

437
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,550
Do anything that involves a lot

438
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:19,900
of chopping, deep knee bends.

439
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,165
No nudity.

440
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,000
Waiter... Cocktail.

441
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,000
Just generally try
to keep my clothes on.

442
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:27,200
You know, it's...

443
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
<i>Are you insane?</i>

444
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,965
You can't be yourself.

445
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,200
You have to be better than yourself.

446
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:35,600
Are you guys having lobster?

447
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,500
Could you bring back a doggie bag?

448
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,100
All right, take it off, take it off.

449
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:40,300
Be better. Got to be better.

450
00:20:40,335 --> 00:20:42,100
Where am I from?

451
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,800
Whew... Wow.

452
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,700
Where are any of us really from?

453
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:47,817
I myself hail from many fathers.

454
00:20:47,852 --> 00:20:49,865
Nietzsche, Sartre, Jor-El...

455
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,000
He's... Encino. He's from Encino.

456
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,400
There I was... there I was,

457
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,600
there... I... was...

458
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,100
in the Congo.

459
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,100
When you guys eat Chinese food

460
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,300
do you get hungry a hour later, too?

461
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,400
There she goes.

462
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
You don't mind, do you, babe?

463
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,100
You know who else
famously smoked a pipe?

464
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,700
Boyhood hero of mine.

465
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah, yeah, quite the yachtsman himself.

466
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,600
OnePopeye the Sailor Man.

467
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,200
Anyone? Huh?

473
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,400
for one second? Thank you.

474
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,165
Hey, Morgan.

475
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,600
Yeah, hey, hey, dude, we got
a possible situation here.

476
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,517
I'm out lunching with Anna's Parents

477
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,400
at some fancy yacht club in the Marina.

478
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:46,465
Okay, when who do I see,

479
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,100
but someone who resembles the
future Mrs. Chuck Bartowski.

480
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:51,200
All right, now she's getting lotioned up

481
00:21:51,235 --> 00:21:53,665
by some creepy Richard Branson

482
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,600
<i>meets Willem Dafoe
- lookin' dude, right?</i>

483
00:21:55,635 --> 00:21:58,165
<i>And he is all over her, man.</i>

484
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,400
<i>I mean, he is really greasing
her and working up this lather.</i>

485
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:04,267
I mean, it's just, it's,
uh, quite a scene over here.

486
00:22:04,302 --> 00:22:07,100
And, um, hey, listen, I got
to go, man, lobster here.

487
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,600
Hey, oh, hey, hey, hey, hey!

488
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:22,000
Don't shoot. Put the gun down.

489
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,365
You can have the jelly-filled.

490
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,800
What are you doing here, Bartowski?

491
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,400
Thought you might be hungry, you know.

492
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,600
Friend to friend kind of a thing.

493
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,465
Where's Sarah?

494
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,765
Oh, that's it. You think

495
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,265
your girlfriend's stepping out on you.

496
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,100
Agent Walker is fine
and doing her job, see?

497
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,900
Plus, we have a whole team here

498
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,300
to back her up, okay?

499
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,300
So you can beat it, Bartowski.

500
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,200
Oh, my God, they're going down.

501
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,665
chuck, What is it?

502
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,150
They're loading counterfeit
plates onto the boat.

503
00:23:00,185 --> 00:23:02,600
They're hidden in crates
marked as aid medicines.

504
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:03,300
What?

505
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,300
Yeah, I just flashed on a crate

506
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:05,965
they just brought onboard.

507
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,900
That's why Kirk just
brought Sarah below deck.

508
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:09,117
This guy's important, Chuck.

509
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:10,626
We can't be wrong. You sure?

510
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:12,100
I just flashed. I'm sure, okay?

511
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,300
This is Casey.

512
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,800
We're going in... Go.

513
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,700
Federal agents. Nobody move!

514
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,000
Excuse me for a moment.

515
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,300
Who are you people?

516
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,165
NSA.

517
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,400
- Stay right there. Let us do our job.
- Your job?

518
00:23:40,435 --> 00:23:42,467
- Do you have any idea who I am?
- Open it.

519
00:23:42,502 --> 00:23:44,500
That crate is a bonded
humanitarian shipment

520
00:23:44,535 --> 00:23:46,665
certified by the United Nations.

521
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,065
It's illegal for any of you to open it.

522
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,200
Oh, I can make some phone calls.
Hope you don't mind waiting.

523
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:52,100
Oh, I do, so we won't.

524
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,300
Medical supplies.

525
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,600
For the earthquake victims of Taiwan.

526
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:00,200
I wanted to deliver it myself.

527
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
We leave tomorrow.

528
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,065
Now, if I could get

529
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,550
your names and agency affiliations,

530
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:07,292
I want to make sure that everybody

531
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:09,263
is properly accounted for when I speak

532
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:11,200
to your bosses' bosses
later this evening.

533
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,500
Ellie or Awesome home?

534
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,350
No. They're at work.

535
00:24:20,385 --> 00:24:21,865
And hello to you, too.

536
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,100
What the hell happened today?

537
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,100
I
- I don't know. I don't get it.

538
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:26,200
I had a flash.

539
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,865
Right when I went below deck with Kirk.

540
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,400
- It's pretty convenient timing, I would say.
- What are you talking about?

541
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,400
Just when you thought that I
was getting intimate with Kirk,

542
00:24:32,435 --> 00:24:33,717
you decided to have a flash.

543
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:34,965
What exactly are you implying?

544
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,700
That I faked the flash?
That I'm a flash faker?

545
00:24:36,735 --> 00:24:38,667
You know, I think we
need to discuss the fact

546
00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:40,600
that you let your emotions
get in the way today.

547
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,900
<i>My emotions?</i>

548
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,965
Things have been a little
off since the incident, Chuck.

549
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,100
Really? And what incident are you
referring to, Agent Walker, huh?

550
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,865
Could it be the incident
where you planted a kiss

551
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,400
on me right before a bomb was
supposed to go off, ending our lives?

552
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
That same kiss right before
your boyfriend, Bryce,

553
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,900
came back from the dead, that kiss?

554
00:24:56,935 --> 00:24:58,117
Stop saying kiss. It happened.

555
00:24:58,152 --> 00:24:59,265
Okay? What's done is done.

556
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,900
Can we just not talk about it, please?

557
00:25:00,935 --> 00:25:02,367
Okay, fine. Absolutely, of course.

558
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:03,701
Just answer me one little thing.

559
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:04,965
Chuck... Did you kiss me that night

560
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,065
because you thought
we were going to die,

561
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,000
and mine were the most
convenient lips around,

562
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,800
or was it actually about me?

563
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,000
What happened was a mistake.

564
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,300
One I won't make again.

565
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,000
Well, well, well!

566
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,765
Lookin' good, Morgan.

567
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Well, feelin' good, Charles.

568
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,500
And how was, uh, meeting Anna's parents?

569
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:50,165
Uh, it was... it was fine.

570
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,000
You know, I think it went, uh, okay...

571
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,000
...ish.

572
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,165
Let's just say he wasn't

573
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,000
the Morgan we've all
come to know and love.

574
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,465
- Hey, Captain Steubing!
- Morning, Michael.

575
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,800
You know, I was I thinking
about focusing my energy

576
00:26:05,835 --> 00:26:07,265
on the starboard side
of the store today.

577
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,800
You don't change into some
regulation clothing right now,

578
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:11,900
I'm gonna kick the
starboard side of your ass.

579
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,065
Why do people hate the rich?

580
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,300
Hey, listen, speaking of starboard,

581
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,500
uh, Anna's parents invited us,

582
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,265
or at least Anna, on a cruise

583
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,800
with some of their
big-shot Taiwanese friends.

584
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:22,700
You and Sarah should join us.

585
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,365
Supposed to be some
bigwig diplomats there.

586
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,600
You and Sarah should be hanging
out with diplomats, Chuck.

587
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,965
Oh. Or just you.

588
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,400
Right. I'm sorry, dude.

589
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,300
Did you find out that
was Sarah yesterday?

590
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Yeah. Yeah.

591
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,500
Yeah, that wasn't her.

592
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,400
Must have been some other
busty, long-legged blonde.

593
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,000
They're a dime a dozen around here.

594
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,765
Figured it wasn't her, you know?

595
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,500
And to be honest with you,
I wasn't looking at her face.

596
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,200
Well, boat later, huh?

597
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,700
You? Me?

598
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,100
Shrimp cocktail's supposed to be served.

599
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,900
Thanks, buddy, but, uh,

600
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,600
I think I'm going to
stay landlocked tonight.

601
00:26:55,635 --> 00:26:57,900
Oh, well, suit yourself. Ahoy hoy.

602
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,300
<i>Which part of handle Lon Kirk
with caution wasn't clear,</i>

603
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,700
Agents Walker and Casey?

604
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:05,000
Chuck flashed, General.

605
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Our decision to raid the boat
was based on the information

606
00:27:07,535 --> 00:27:09,000
we received from the Intersect.

607
00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:10,500
Except Chuck was wrong.

608
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,900
We think Kirk must have managed
to hide the plates somehow.

609
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,900
Where?

610
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,265
We don't know.

611
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,600
So, you moved in anyway?

612
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,800
Is there something that
might have caused Chuck

613
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:22,767
to think those plates
were on Kirk's boat?

614
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:24,700
Anything that might
have caused his flash?

615
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,300
Not that we're aware of.

616
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,300
I don't want the two of you
anywhere near Kirk from now on.

617
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,200
Both of us? But he doesn't suspect me.

618
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,467
We don't know that,

619
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:35,665
and we can't risk it.

620
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,400
So until further notice,
consider yourselves benched.

621
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,800
Well, that was a bang-up job, Walker.

622
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,600
All right, I'm going to give you
one last chance to come clean.

623
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:51,200
Did you or did you not compromise
yourself and the Intersect?

624
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,500
Do you ever just want
to have a normal life?

625
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Have a family?

626
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Children?

627
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,300
The choice we made

628
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,500
to protect something
bigger than ourselves

629
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,800
is the right choice,

630
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,500
hard as that is for you
to remember sometimes.

631
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,900
I'll talk to Chuck.

632
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,565
And if I can't fix this,

633
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,400
then I'm going to ask
for a reassignment.

634
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,200
Oh.

635
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,200
Aha, Gilligan.

636
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,600
Hey there, little buddy.

637
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,300
The plates are on Rashan's boat.

638
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,200
Oh...

639
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,065
This baby's got it all.

640
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,400
You got the four main burners...

641
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:37,000
Hey, hey, we need to talk.

642
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,100
Later. I'm about to move a Beastmaster.

643
00:29:39,135 --> 00:29:40,200
No. Now.

644
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,800
Fine.

645
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,200
I'll be right back.

646
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,100
This better be good.

647
00:29:46,135 --> 00:29:46,965
Morgan sent me a jpeg

648
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,550
from the Taiwanese attaché's yacht.

649
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:50,092
Okay? I uploaded it to my computer,

650
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:51,863
and then I used an XTEL software device

651
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:53,600
to break down the data
into readable bytes.

652
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,300
English, Bartowski.

653
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
I blew up the photo.

654
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,400
The counterfeiting plates
are on Rashan's boat

655
00:29:59,435 --> 00:30:00,865
<i>with Anna and Morgan.</i>

656
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,800
These are the same crates
you flashed on yesterday.

657
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:03,917
The one's that got us benched.

658
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:05,000
Did you just hear what I said?

659
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:06,300
Morgan and Anna are on...

660
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,565
Look, I'm right about this.

661
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,200
The Intersect is right about this.

662
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,900
Orders are orders.

663
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Your wiener, sir.

664
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,800
Excuse me. Look, I need to talk to you.

665
00:30:20,835 --> 00:30:21,765
Chuck, please, not now.

666
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,300
Sarah, these are the same crates
that I flashed on yesterday,

667
00:30:24,335 --> 00:30:25,265
right here on a boat

668
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,465
with the Taiwanese attaché.

669
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,100
The one you saw arguing with Kirk.

670
00:30:28,135 --> 00:30:29,665
He's getting away with the plates.

671
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,850
You think Kirk put the
plates on Rashan's boat?

672
00:30:31,885 --> 00:30:34,000
Yes. Look, I know that
your orders are to stay away

673
00:30:34,035 --> 00:30:35,265
from this, but you have to believe me.

674
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,900
The plates are on that boat,
possibly with Morgan and Anna.

675
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,900
Look, trust me, I wouldn't
even be here right now

676
00:30:39,935 --> 00:30:40,817
if I wasn't 100% sure.

677
00:30:40,852 --> 00:30:41,700
What... What are you...?

678
00:30:41,735 --> 00:30:42,600
Let's go.

679
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,800
Chuck!

680
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,500
Sarah!

681
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,400
casey, what are you doing here?

682
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,300
Someone needs to protect
the Intersect, huh?

683
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,650
Well, that's very thoughtful.

684
00:30:57,685 --> 00:30:58,565
Thank you very much, I guess.

685
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Plus, I didn't want to
miss any gunplay. Come on.

686
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Look, there he is.

687
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,100
There's a GPS missile
tracking device on the ship.

688
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,300
They're going to blow it up.

689
00:31:23,335 --> 00:31:23,965
Kirk's got his money,

690
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,300
and he's going to bury the evidence.

691
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,300
I'm king of the world!

692
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,200
I'm king of the world!

693
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,965
i'm king of the world!

694
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,800
They're loading
something on Kirk's boat.

695
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,950
That's it. That's the missile launcher.

696
00:31:38,985 --> 00:31:40,692
They're going to follow
them out and use it

697
00:31:40,727 --> 00:31:42,400
to take out the
Taiwanese attaché's boat.

698
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
- The one with Morgan on it? Little buddy.
- Yeah.

699
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,665
Casey, I'm going to create a diversion.

700
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,600
- I'll get the guards. Chuck...
- Yeah, I know. Stay in the car.

701
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:48,900
- I get it.
- Not this time.

702
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,400
We've got a GPS tracker on their ship.

703
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:53,900
The rocket guides itself.

704
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,065
Are the coordinates set?

705
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,300
Yes, sir. I've just
got to pull the trigger.

706
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,000
No. When the time comes,
I'll pull the trigger.

707
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,300
I never liked Rashan anyway.

708
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:01,865
Sir?

709
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,000
We've got a situation.

710
00:32:03,035 --> 00:32:03,900
Lon?

711
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,400
Lon!

712
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,700
Oh...

713
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,400
Hi.

714
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,765
It's okay, it's okay.

715
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,200
Uh, Lon, uh, I'm so sorry,
but I... I had to talk to you.

716
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,865
Well, uh, that's great, Sarah,

717
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,200
but we're actually about to push off.

718
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:17,265
I know, I know.

719
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,700
Uh, God, this is...
this is embarrassing,

720
00:32:20,735 --> 00:32:24,065
but, uh, it's just,
since I was here last,

721
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,500
I haven't been able to
stop thinking about you,

722
00:32:26,535 --> 00:32:28,900
and I was just wondering
if maybe we could talk

723
00:32:28,935 --> 00:32:29,900
or...?

724
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,365
Um, uh...

725
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,000
...uh, yeah, okay, we
have a couple minutes.

726
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,900
Well, well, well!

727
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,050
I see how it is, Sarah!

728
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:41,900
How could you do this?

729
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,200
After everything that I've done for you.

730
00:32:45,235 --> 00:32:47,165
After all that I've given to you.

731
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,100
The house... the house in the Hamptons.

732
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,900
Huh? Or-or, uh...

733
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,165
Or what about the summers

734
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,500
in South Africa, or
the winters in Gstaad?

735
00:32:56,535 --> 00:32:58,100
You don't own me, Charles.

736
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,900
Lon knows how I really feel.

737
00:32:59,935 --> 00:33:00,700
Do you love him?

738
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,100
You know what? I actually
don't have time for this.

739
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,700
Oh, yes, you do.

740
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,600
Shh, shh...

741
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,700
Yeah, I know what you're up to, buddy.

742
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,365
- I know the truth.
- Why don't you just go home?

743
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,500
- Tell me...
- You know what? It is time for you to go.

744
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,400
What was that?

745
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,665
He's in... Sarah... Oh, hey.

746
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,100
No, he's... he went in
the... he went in the...

747
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Get out of the way.

748
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,200
Put the rocket launcher down.

749
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,100
Oh!

750
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,700
Hey, hey, hey.

751
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,600
look, look, look, The rocket
is guided by GPS software.

752
00:33:49,635 --> 00:33:51,000
All software can be reset.

753
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,400
Hurry up.

754
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,100
Great. Bye.

755
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,765
Look at the size...

756
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,465
these things are the size of baby cats.

757
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,265
You're going to be sick if
you don't stop eating those.

758
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,100
Yeah, but look, Mr. Wu, have
you ever seen something so huge?

759
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:11,200
Please stop that.

760
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,900
This is fant...

761
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,700
Oh, Anna, look, look, look, look, look.

762
00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:16,200
Fireworks.

763
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,800
That's it.

764
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Ooh...

765
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,900
You did it, Chuck.

766
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,765
I can't... I can't...

767
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,100
I can't believe that worked.

768
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,800
Chuck, where's the rocket heading now?

769
00:34:32,835 --> 00:34:34,865
I don't know. I reset it.

770
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,000
You sure reset doesn't
mean return to sender?

771
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,065
Oh, man.

772
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,265
Oh, oh, oh, man. Oh, man.

773
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,665
Enter another target. Away from us.

774
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,900
I need-I need another target
first, with GPS coordinates.

775
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,300
Casey, what about your car?

776
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,765
- No!
- Come on, we're running out of time here!

777
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,000
Just tell me what the GPS
coordinates are for the Crown Vic.

778
00:34:56,035 --> 00:34:58,000
- Tell him, Casey!
- Tell me, Casey!

779
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,900

7-1-4-7-7.

780
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm really sorry, buddy. Oh!

781
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,300
I hate this assignment.

782
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,300
I said I was sorry, right?

783
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,700
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, dude.

784
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,700
How did it go with Anna's
family on the yacht?

785
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,200
Fine, until I got seasick and barfed.

786
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,100
Was Anna freaked out?

787
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,600
She rubbed my back mid-puke
and then brought me a warm cloth

788
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,200
to clean the shrimp
blobs out of my beard.

789
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:55,600
- Hmm.
- She's an amazing woman, dude.

790
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,600
And I am a lucky guy.

791
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,600
Is there any way you can say
that to her, instead of me?

792
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:02,165
Yeah, I guess I could,

793
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,365
but that would leave me
completely vulnerable.

794
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,650
You know, kind of like a sweet
little puppy laying on his back

795
00:36:06,685 --> 00:36:08,900
waiting for his belly to be
scratched, privates just kind of

796
00:36:08,935 --> 00:36:10,400
dangling out there for everyone to see.

797
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,900
But I can certainly give it a shot.

798
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:15,800
You know?

799
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,300
Store's closed.

800
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,700
Time to get polluted.

801
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,000
Okay, people.

802
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,000
The official Buy More Christmas...

803
00:36:27,035 --> 00:36:28,000
Hey, now.

804
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,400
Holiday Party is about to commence.

805
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,165
As a reminder, I will accept all gifts-

806
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,400
cash and checks
- in my office or under the tree.

807
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,300
Keep it clean and be
prepared to get down!

808
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,400
I'll be right back.

809
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,965
Hey, uh, listen,

810
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,800
I
- I'm really sorry about the whole...

811
00:37:18,835 --> 00:37:19,765
Killing my car thing?

812
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,700
Yeah, that. Again, sorry.

813
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,700
She was my dream car.

814
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,800
A Crown Victoria was your dream car?

815
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,265
And why wouldn't it be?

816
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,000
Really beautiful lines, I
- I've always found.

817
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,800
I feel terrible about that, okay?

818
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:34,467
But it is the holidays, right?

819
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,100
Which is a time for forgiveness.

820
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,700
Is there anything I can
do to make it up to you?

821
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:41,400
Sure. You can buy me a new car.

822
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,300
Ha.

823
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,000
You're totally serious.

824
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,300
I... that's my jam.

825
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,400
Nun.

826
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,300
I do believe that makes me the winner.

827
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,000
I thought Shin beat Nun.

828
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,300
Mm-hmm...

829
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,500
And have you been bar
mitzvah'd, Jeffrey?

830
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,900
- No.

831
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,500
Anna, can I talk to you?

832
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,200
Um...

833
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,100
Uh...

834
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,400
I'm really sorry that
I was kind of a jerk

835
00:38:12,435 --> 00:38:13,465
in front of your parents.

836
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,000
You know, I pretended
to be something I'm not

837
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,100
because I thought...

838
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,000
I thought that you
were embarrassed of me.

839
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,200
Morgan,

840
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,065
I didn't want you to meet my parents

841
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,000
<i>because I'm embarrassed of
who I am in front of them.</i>

842
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,100
What do you mean?

843
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,950
Pretending to be their
obedient little girl,

844
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:35,100
dressing a certain
way, not being myself.

845
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,000
I didn't want you to see me like that.

846
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,900
I did miss your pretty makeup,

847
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,600
and your inappropriately short skirts.

848
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,000
Not everything's changed, Morgan.

849
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,900
You think the break room door is locked?

850
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:51,000
Let's find out.

851
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,800
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night.

852
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,000
Hi.

853
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,300
I'm glad you... I'm glad you came.

854
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,600
I got you something.

855
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,500
It's a new alarm clock. Merry Christmas.

856
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,600
You shouldn't have.

857
00:39:23,635 --> 00:39:25,100
Ah, come on.

858
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,200
They're on sale in Home Electronics.

859
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,300
Which reminds me, I should
probably scan that thing

860
00:39:29,335 --> 00:39:30,600
before you leave the store with it.

861
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Look, it's also kind of
a... kind of a thank you

862
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,000
for believing me when you
had good reason not to.

863
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,100
Well, it's my job, you know.

864
00:39:41,135 --> 00:39:41,900
It's what I do.

865
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
It's the one thing I'm good at.

866
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,500
Really?

867
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
'Cause I'm pretty sure you're
good at a lot of things.

868
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,600
Well, as you can see from everything

869
00:39:52,635 --> 00:39:54,100
that happened with Bryce,

870
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,600
I'm not so good at relationships.

871
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,500
I guess that makes two of us.

872
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,200
And then that makes me good at...

873
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,865
pretty much nothing, I suppose.

874
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,700
Chuck, you're good at your job, too.

875
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,600
And not just here, fixing computers.

876
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,950
You know, the one where you
risk your life to save others;

877
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:23,600
the one that you didn't ask
for but were supposed to have.

878
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,300
Friends?

879
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,300
Yeah. Friends.

880
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,300
Mistletoe.

881
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,900
You'll thank me later, dude.

882
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,500
How about we just dance?

883
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:50,900
Sure.

884
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,000
Lame.

885
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,300
Casey.

886
00:40:58,335 --> 00:40:59,000
Major.

887
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,700
i am calling to imform you that the baby
version of intersect computer was successful.

888
00:41:03,735 --> 00:41:06,900
this means the new intersect
should be up running soon.

889
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,900
Once the new computer is on line,

890
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,500
it will be time to
take care of Bartowski.

891
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,500
Roger that.

892
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,000
I hope you have not grown
too fond of the subject.

893
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,700
I would hate for you to be compromised.

894
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,900
I understand my orders, General.

895
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,900
Oh, and... John?

896
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,600
Yeah?

897
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,400
Happy Holidays.
