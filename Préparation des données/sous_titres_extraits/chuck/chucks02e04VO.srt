1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
DJ Just got a call
from Heather Chandler,

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,000
who'd like
to dedicate this next song

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,600
to the James Buchanan
varsity football team.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,300
Go, Cougars!

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,700
SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA. 1998.

6
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,000
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
LOVE YOU, DADDY

7
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,800
You know, you don't have to
keep buying stuff for cover

8
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,100
BURBANK, CALIFORNIA. 2008
just 'cause you're
in here all the time.

9
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,300
BURBANK, CALIFORNIA. 2008
I actually needed
new iPod speakers.

10
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,500
I'm just saying it's
perfectly plausible

11
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:44,900
that you're in
here to discuss

12
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,800
dinner plans with
me, your boyfriend.

13
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Okay, sweetie, what are you in
the mood for, Thai or Chinese?

14
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,100
Wait, really?
No, I'm still

15
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,600
digesting my Honey
Nut Cheerios.

16
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,800
Okay, I'm a
little unprepared

17
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,000
to discuss dinner
plans at this point.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, unless we're...

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,200
unless we're not going
to be actually eating.

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Will we be eating food
or are we just saying

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,500
we'll be eating food?

22
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,700
Not that it really
matters, it just...

23
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,100
it'll factor into
lunch, you know?

24
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,600
Can I get a straight
answer from you, Sarah?

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,400
I mean, you don't have
to be so secretive

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,900
or dodgy about pad
Thai noodles...

27
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,600
Bogey at your six.

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Roger that- secure
the asset immediately.

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,000
Take him to the Orange Orange.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,700
Hey, ow, ow,
okay, okay, okay.

31
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,600
You stay here.

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,500
Why, what's going on?

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,700
I couldn't shake
a suspicious tail,

34
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,500
so until we establish
the depth of the threat,

35
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,000
you're staying put- don't move.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,200
Touch nothing.

37
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,300
Wait for me, got it?

38
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,600
Whatever.

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,700
Oh, wow.

40
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,600
I can't believe I'm this close
to an actual DU97.

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,200
Freon-cooled, reconfigurable
30-teraflop architecture

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,100
with modules for cryptanalysis
and video processing.

43
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,300
She's so beautiful.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,300
I know you.

45
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,000
And I never
forget a face.

46
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,300
Buy More, courtyard.

47
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,500
AKWARD

48
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,900
Guess I just have one
of those familiar faces.

49
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,600
Jackpot.

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,500
That's not it-
I know you.

51
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,000
I tried my hand at acting
a while back.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,900
It'll come to me.

53
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,800
I was on a national
television commercial.

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,300
I ate a messy cheeseburger.

55
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,400
Maybe that's it.

56
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,000
I know exactly who you are.

57
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,800
We went to high school together!

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,500
What?

59
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Wait, wait, wait,
don't tell me your name.

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,700
I'll get it.

61
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,800
I never forget
a face.

62
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,600
You look so
different now.

63
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,900
Well, for the
better, I mean.

64
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,200
Oh, I'm sure you
have me confused

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,800
- with someone else...
- Jenny!

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,700
That's it: Jenny Burton!

67
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,400
Jenny Burton?

68
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,800
Heather Chandler.

69
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,200
Well, Heather Ratner now.

70
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,700
I married
Mark Ratner.

71
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
James Buchanan High,
class of '98.

72
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,500
Go, Cougars!

73
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,000
Heather, of course.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,500
Um, how have you been?

75
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,200
Oh, my God, Mark,
look who it is.

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,900
It's Jenny Burton.

77
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,000
Who?

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,600
Jenny Burton from
high school.

79
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
You know, the one.

80
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Oh, yeah, hi, Jenny.

81
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,900
Heading down for the reunion
this weekend?

82
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,100
Oh, no, I'm not much
of a reunion person.

83
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,600
Hey.

84
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,800
I told you to stay put.

85
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
I know, I just, you know...

86
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,000
the tummy is a-rumbling.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,900
- Chuck.
- Yes, honey?

88
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,300
Is this your
boyfriend?

89
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,900
Wait, you know
these people, sweetie?

90
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,900
- NO.
-  I'm Heather- we all went to high school together.

91
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,500
Come on!

92
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,700
Of all the semi-tart
Asian influenced

93
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,400
frozen yogurt shops
in all the towns

94
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
in all the world,
you walked into hers?

95
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,100
I know, it's
crazy, right?

96
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,200
We live
in Westlake now

97
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,500
because its closer
to Mark's work,

98
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,300
but we go down
there all the time.

99
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,600
Do you? You go...

100
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,000
go down there, huh?

101
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,400
Weather's real nice
this time of year.

102
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,300
Do you need a to-go lid?

103
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,300
Well, come on now.

104
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
Weather's always great
in San Diego.

105
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,600
Yes, it is!

106
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,400
That's what I always say,
down there

107
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,800
in San Diego where you're from.

108
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,700
I'm Chuck, by the way,

109
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,800
but around here,

110
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,800
people just know me as...

111
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,500
as Jenny's Chuck.

112
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,300
Jenny and Chuck.

113
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,600
Chuck and Jenny.

114
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,200
Chuck, I'm Mark Ratner.

115
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,300
VOICE RECOGNITION: MATCH

116
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
VINTHROP-KELLER
AERONAUTICS

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,700
Brain freeze.

118
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,700
I think I had a little
too much yogurt.

119
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,000
Hey.

120
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,000
What are you guys doing
for dinner tonight?

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
You got any plans?
'Cause maybe

122
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
we could all
get together

123
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,100
and reminisce about old times.

124
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,200
Sounds great.

125
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,100
I mean, any friends of Jenny
are friends of mine.

126
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,900
Oh, I don't know, Chuck,

127
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,500
it might be pretty
boring for you

128
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,300
to take a trip
down memory lane with us.

129
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,200
Good God, no, not at all.

130
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,500
I can't think of anything
that I'd rather do

131
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,700
than spend an evening

132
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,100
learning all about...

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,100
my Jenny.

<i>Gather 'round, clock punchers.</i>

138
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Big announcement.

139
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,900
I'm not coming in

140
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,700
for a few days-
got a meeting.

141
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,600
Oh, some fat cats
over at corporate?

142
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,400
Nope.

143
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,800
With a bunch
of fat catfish

144
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,200
over in Lake Havasu.

145
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,900
And while I'm away,
Mr. Patel here

146
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,700
will be in charge.

147
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Party hardy.

148
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,500
Or the opposite of that?

149
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,600
I want you to give Lester
the same respect you give me.

150
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,800
When you look
at him,

151
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,700
I want you
to see Big Mike

152
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,900
and not some
scrawny-ass Indian kid

153
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,800
with a Bay City
Rollers hairdo.

154
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Thank you, sir.

155
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,200
That's it.

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,500
Back to the salt mine.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,900
<i>Dinner? Come on!</i>

158
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,400
What the hell
were you thinking, Chuck?

159
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,300
What was I
supposed to do?

160
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,000
I flashed on the guy.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,200
Those people
are from my past,

162
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,500
a past you have no business
poking around in.

163
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,300
Well, I'm sorry, I was
just trying to do my job.

164
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,500
I thought you'd be happy
I used a little initiative.

165
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,400
Uh, don't kill the messenger.

166
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,700
Not the kid's fault
you went to high school

167
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,500
with a treasonous scumbag.

168
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,100
Good morning, boys and girl.

169
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,600
First matter of
business: Mark Ratner.

170
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,900
He's an engineer
at Winthrop-Keller Aeronautics,

171
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,100
has clearance to
extremely sensitive plans

172
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,200
for future weapons
technology.

173
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,400
Picture the next generation
of F-22 Raptors.

174
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Essentially, a superbomber.

175
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,000
This technology
has been leaked.

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,400
Chuck's instincts
were good.

177
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,800
Your mission is
to go to dinner

178
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,600
with the Ratners, see if Chuck
flashes off of anything.

179
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,700
General, I apologize,
but I'm afraid

180
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,500
I must recuse myself
from this mission.

181
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,100
My cover has been compromised.

182
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Agent Walker,

183
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,000
you have preexisting social
history with the target.

184
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,900
Seems to me like you
have the perfect cover.

185
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,300
But it's not a cover,
ma'am, it's me.

186
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,100
Well, I hope you
enjoy Italian food.

187
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,600
<i>Buon appetito.</i>

188
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,100
<i>With Big Mike gone,</i>

189
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,200
I've come up
with a plan

190
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,100
to revolutionize
Buy More sales.

191
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,900
<i>From now on, we're gonna work
with our customers</i>

192
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,100
to create a mutually
agreed upon price.

193
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,300
Yeah, but how are we supposed
to do that? I mean...

194
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,700
As this is
a teaching hospital...

195
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,900
watch and learn,
my friends.

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,900
Watch and learn.

197
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,900
- Hey.
- Hey.

198
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,700
So, you're in the market
for a new TV.

199
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,000
- Yeah. 
- You shopping for your mother?

200
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,000
What?

201
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,400
No, it's for me.

202
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,300
This one's a little
dainty, isn't it?

203
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,100
You want the complete
entertainment experience.

204
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,400
I would recommend
this one.

205
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,500
Uh, I can't
afford this one.

206
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

207
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't get caught up in this.

208
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,300
This...

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,300
is just a suggestion.

210
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,500
How about you make me an offer?

211
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,700
Okay.

212
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,400
How about you shave 300 bucks
off that price?

213
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,800
- Sold.
- Really?

214
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,400
Hey there.

215
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,800
May I help you
with this washer and dryer?

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,600
Oh, afraid it's
not in my budget.

217
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,500
I'm only in the
market for a dryer.

218
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,000
Ma'am, that's like
buying one new shoe.

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,900
No, no, no, no,
make me an offer.

220
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,900
You happy with
that price?

221
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,600
Guess I'd be happier
if it was 100 bucks cheaper.

222
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,900
I live for your smile.

223
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,600
Let me take off $200.

224
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,100
Deal.

225
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,400
I'll sell you
that computer

226
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,900
for 400 bucks
off sticker price.

227
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,200
Hey, buddy, what's going on?

228
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,200
Lester's new sales policy.

229
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,200
We're giving away
the merchandise.

230
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,000
Throw in
a wireless mouse?

231
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,700
<i>Throw in a wireless mouse
and a bonus computer.</i>

232
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,100
That's gonna
end badly.

233
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,500
I know.

234
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,900
I know, Chuck.

235
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,300
That's part of the fun.

236
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,500
Sold.

237
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,600
You're early.

238
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,500
Technically, I'm right on time

239
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,200
for my pre-mission
debriefing.

240
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,700
What are you talking about?

241
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,000
Standard spy protocol.

242
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,200
You know, I need some stats
for my cover tonight.

243
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,500
- Chuck, I'm really...
- No need to apologize

244
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,700
if you didn't have time
for full dossier preparation.

245
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,600
I think we'll just go over a few
facts together if that's okay.

246
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,700
Fantastic. I'll go first.

247
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,200
Uh, tonight, I'll be playing the
role of Jenny's boyfriend Chuck.

248
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,300
He works at the Buy More,
not living up to his potential.

249
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,600
Sister is Ellie, doctor,
engaged to a doctor.

250
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,900
There, all up to speed
on Jenny's boyfriend.

251
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,900
Your turn.

252
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,800
I'm not doing this.

253
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,400
Okay, here's what we know
thus far.

254
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,200
Jenny Burton went to

255
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,400
James Buchanan
High School

256
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,100
in San Diego, California,
class of 1998.

257
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,400
Is it safe to assume
that "Jenny"

258
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,900
is a diminutive of "Jennifer?"

259
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,500
Back off, Chuck.

260
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,900
You have as much information as
is pertinent to this assignment.

261
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,600
Spell "Jenny" with
an "I" or would...

262
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,100
All Jenny's boyfriend
needs to know

263
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,700
is that Jenny hates
questions about her past.

264
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,200
You got that?

265
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,900
I'm good.
Yeah, I'm good.

266
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,700
How do you do that?

267
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,700
So, Mark,

268
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,200
uh... what line of work
are you in?

269
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,600
Uh, engineering.

270
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,400
Actually, what
I'm working on

271
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,800
is technically...

272
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,400
- top secret.
- And let's keep it that way,

273
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,900
'cause no one gives a rip.

274
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,700
So, how long have you two
lovebirds been together?

275
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,800
- Months.
- Years.

276
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,300
That add up to years.

277
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,800
You know, I don't even remember
my life before Chuck.

278
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,800
What's the matter with you?

279
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,700
You're sweating
like a pig.

280
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,900
It's kind of gross.

281
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,200
No. Oh, sorry.

282
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,800
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

283
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,900
Would you excuse me
for a minute?

284
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,800
Sure.

285
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,700
So, Jenny, is your

286
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,500
job at the yogurt shop,
like, a career

287
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,600
or are you
keeping yourself

288
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
in Top Ramen
between acting gigs.

289
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,400
Oh, I-I've got
a few things going on.

290
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,700
I mean, Chuck,
if you had told me

291
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,400
in high school that Jenny Burton
wanted to grow up

292
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,300
to be a movie star,
I would've said,

293
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,100
"Dream,
little duckling, dream. "

294
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
And now here we are.

295
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Your time is up,
Mr. Ratner.

296
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,400
Soup looks delicious, Chuck.

297
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,100
Mmm, it is.

298
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,000
Cilantro,
very controversial.

299
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,900
You either love
it or hate it.

300
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,200
Me, I love it.

301
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,500
So, Jenny, when's the last time
you were down in San Diego?

302
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Mm, it's
been a while.

303
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Mm, don't get to visit
your dad much?

304
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,400
Um, excuse me,
more wine, please.

305
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,100
Ah, yes.

306
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,600
It's a lovely pinot
noir, earthy, complex,

307
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,700
- with a hint of cherry blossoms.
- So, you know when you're kids

308
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,700
and there's
always that funhouse

309
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,700
that all the kids
hang out at.

310
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,300
Would you say that was

311
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,500
the case with Jenny's

312
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,300
- house-condo-apartment?
- Oh!
- Oh! 
- Oh, my God.

313
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,500
I'm so sorry.

314
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,700
God, I'm-I'm
such a spaz.

315
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,300
Now, there's the Jenny we know.

316
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,100
Excuse me.
Beg your pardon.

317
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Not the first American tax
dollars wasted on a man's lap.

318
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,300
Give us the plans now.

319
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,800
I need to know 
that if I hand over the plans,

320
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,500
no harm will come to my wife.

321
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,400
Oh, my God.

322
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,300
Who the hell are you?
Who is this guy?!

323
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,600
This is setup?

324
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
No! God, no!
He's no one!

325
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,600
That's a little hurtful.

326
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
He's just the
boyfriend

327
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,900
of some-some girl
that I went

328
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,400
to high school with!

329
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,300
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna
grab some club soda

330
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,000
to take care of my stain.

331
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,800
So, Heather, uh, how do you
stay in such great shape?

332
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,500
Got obsessed with karate 'cause
my instructor's such a hottie.

333
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,900
I'm a black belt now.

334
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,600
I clued in you didn't want

335
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,900
to talk about
your dad's situation

336
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,400
in front of your BF.

337
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,700
Does Chuck not know?

338
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,900
Uh, do you mind if I take over?

339
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,900
Oh, no.

340
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,000
It's my first day.

341
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,400
- Go check on Chuck.
- If you promise

342
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,600
not to filet her
before I get back.

343
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,700
- I can't promise anything.
- Okay.

344
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,900
Took a knife skills course

345
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,500
at the culinary academy.

346
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,400
Is that to further
your yogurt career,

347
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,700
or are you
angling towards

348
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
something bigger?

349
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,200
Say, carving station at Lawry's.

350
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,600
So, what you know?

351
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,900
I don't know anything.

352
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,300
I just came in to do
my little boy business.

353
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,300
Turn on hand dryer,

354
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,900
so no one hear him scream.

355
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,300
Hear who scream? Me scream?

356
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You?

357
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,600
All right.

358
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,300
Gonna pull the van around

359
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,200
so we can stow these guys.

360
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Be right back.

361
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Oh.

362
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,500
How?

363
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,200
How did you do that?

364
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,100
Uh...

365
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,100
Uh, you know,

366
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,800
it's a self-defense thing
I took at the Y.

367
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,900
It was pretty comprehensive.

368
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,900
Are you nuts?

369
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,300
These guys are killers!

370
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,900
Bullies are like bears,
you know?

371
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,100
They're more afraid of you
than you are of them.

372
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,200
Or is that bees?

373
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Actually,
it is bee.

374
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,300
Anyway, when you're dealing
with the Russian mob...

375
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,300
How, how did you know
they're connected to the mob?

376
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,200
Wait a minute.

377
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,000
I know exactly who you are.

378
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,300
Dude!

379
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,200
You're the man!

380
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,800
I'm hardly the man.

381
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,500
So who do you work for?

382
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,800
Is it the FBI?

383
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,700
CIA? NSA?

384
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,800
I, you know, I can't
discuss the particulars.

385
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,100
Okay.

386
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,300
I get it, I get it.

387
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,200
But just tell me, does-does
Jenny know who you really are?

388
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,500
Jenny knows nothing.

389
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,500
Of course not.

390
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,900
But anyway, I-I just
want to thank you so much

391
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,800
for saving my life.

392
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,700
Can't you just

393
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,000
tell me your name, Agent...?

394
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,900
Carmichael.

395
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,500
Special Agent
Charles Carmichael.

396
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,600
This is not a negotiation.

397
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Okay, Ratner,

398
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,300
here's how this is
gonna go down.

399
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:56,900
Wait.

400
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,900
You're our waiter.

401
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,200
From the
restaurant.

402
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,400
Man, we really screwed you
on the tip.

403
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,900
You want into
witness protection,

404
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,600
you're gonna have
to scratch our back, too.

405
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,200
What do you mean?

406
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,700
Those two goons from last night,
they don't report back

407
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,700
to their boss, he's gonna
want a follow-up meet.

408
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,400
We're gonna cover that drop.

409
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,700
He contact
you yet?

410
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,600
I'm sorry, but I
prefer to deal only

411
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,800
with Special
Agent Carmichael.

412
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,100
The man saved my life
last night.

413
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,800
Is that right,
Special Agent Carmichael?

414
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,300
Uh...

415
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,900
It's funny...

416
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,000
You should really see me

417
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,000
scale buildings with
suction cups, 'cause I'm...

418
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,700
I'm very good at that.

419
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,000
I only dabble in the violence.
So...

420
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,900
Modesty doesn't suit you,
Mad Dog.

421
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,200
Mad Dog?

422
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,400
Why... Why do they
call him that?

423
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,400
Listen, I got to know
where your next meet's at, okay?

424
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,700
And I'll ask you real politely.

425
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,600
My partner here, he's a maniac.

426
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,000
It's...

427
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,800
It's fine when
it's to protect you,

428
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,300
but you don't want to be
on the receiving end of Mad Dog.

429
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,500
That's how I got this.

430
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,300
Huh?

431
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,300
I parked in his spot once.

432
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,500
This scar

433
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,400
reminds me every day-
don't mess with Mad Dog.

434
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,000
Now, I'm gonna ask you...

435
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,600
Let me ask you
one more time.

436
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,600
Where's the meet?

437
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,000
Look, I-I don't know, okay?

438
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,800
He texts me.

439
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,300
That's it, that's all I know.

440
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,700
He's all yours,
Mad Dog.

441
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,500
No, no! I...

442
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Wait a minute.

443
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,900
This, this is him,

444
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,600
right now. He's-he's-he's...

445
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,400
He's texting me right
now! This is him!

446
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,300
Okay, he wants to meet tonight.

447
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,700
But-but that doesn't
work for me.

448
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,500
I can't meet tonight.

449
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,600
Tonight's my reunion,

450
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,000
and my wife has
really been looking

451
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,200
forward to this- she
wants to be reunion queen.

452
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,100
I couldn't disappoint her.

453
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,400
Stop talking!

454
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,000
You'll meet him there.

455
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,400
I... I-I don't know about this.

456
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,100
No one's gonna
mess with you, man.

457
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,600
I got your back.

458
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,200
Okay.

459
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,200
Okay, I'll do it.

460
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,900
No!

461
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,500
This can't be right!

462
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,500
No! No! No! No!

463
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,800
No! How did
this happen?!

464
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,600
No!

465
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,100
Hey, Chuck, what's up, buddy?
What are you doing here?

466
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,600
- I thought it's your day off. 
- Yeah.

467
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,700
I had to swing by the mall to
pick something up for Sarah.

468
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,300
It's a long story.
What's going on with Lester?

469
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,800
What is happening?!

470
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,900
Is this broken?!
Are you broken?!

471
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,000
He's been at it for,
like, 15 minutes.

472
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,700
Hey.

473
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,900
What's going on?
Everything okay?

474
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Chuck.

475
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,300
Chuck, thank God you're here.

476
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,800
You-you'll know what to do.

477
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,400
Look, so the new
Friendly Negotiations

478
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,300
sales strategy
worked brilliantly.

479
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,700
Right? We moved
the largest volume

480
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,200
of big-ticket merchandise
in four years.

481
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,900
But no matter how many times
I crunch the numbers,

482
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,000
we're still out 2,700 bucks.

483
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,100
Well, you forgot
to carry the one,

484
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,000
so actually it's 3,700.

485
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,800
What?! Oh,
my God!

486
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,400
I'm sorry I let you down, sir.

487
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,000
All right, come on.

488
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Pull yourself
together here, man.

489
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,200
All right, everybody, listen up.

490
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
We are up excrement creek
without a paddle.

491
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,600
Okay? So we're just
looking for a few ideas

492
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
to make a lot of cash
by tonight. Any ideas?

493
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,700
My mom knows a dude
who will torch the place.

494
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,400
Our troubles will
go up in flames.

495
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,200
Yeah.

496
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,300
While I'm impressed by

497
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,500
the outside-of-the-box nature
of Jeff's pitch,

498
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,400
I'm thinking
maybe

499
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,600
a simpler solution.

500
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,800
Remember when we were
in high school

501
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,000
and we were hard
up for cash,

502
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,900
so when your
parents were out

503
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,300
of town, we'd host
a big kegger,

504
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
invite everybody
and charge by the head.

505
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,100
That's great, Chuck,
that's perfect.

506
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,600
- That's what we're gonna do.
- Yes!

507
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,300
No, no, no, I was... that...

508
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,100
I... that was a good idea
if we were 16.

509
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,500
Invite people from the mall.

510
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,200
And I can call
my best friend, Beer,

511
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,300
see if he can make it
on such short notice.

512
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,000
This could actually work,
this could actually work.

513
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,800
Great, good, glad I'll
be 100 miles away.

514
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,700
LET GO!

515
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,300
Hey, Jenny.

516
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,400
You must be getting
pretty lonely

517
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,900
with your dad locked up.

518
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,100
Call me if you ever need a man
around the house.

519
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
What?

520
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,600
Brought you a present.

521
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,000
Well, it's not
my birthday.

522
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,500
Oh, one down,

523
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,700
364 and a quarter
possibilities to go.

524
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,400
Just open the box, hmm?

525
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
Why do I need
a new dress for?

526
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,900
I know you're gonna see
this as a glass half-empty,

527
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,200
but I think it's a
real opportunity...

528
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
- Spill it! 
- We have to go to your reunion.

529
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,500
Look, I know that you don't like

530
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,600
talking about your past,
much less revisiting it,

531
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,800
but the reunion is where
the drop's going down.

532
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,500
Look, I'm sorry.

533
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
It's just...

534
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,200
High school...

535
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,700
It was a tough time
for me, okay?

536
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,800
Tell me about it.

537
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
I- I-I get that.

538
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,100
Trying to figure out
who you are

539
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,700
and what you're gonna do
with the rest of your life

540
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,100
while constantly distracted
with raging hormones.

541
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,800
- I... 
- It was more than that for me.

542
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,300
Hey... it'll be okay.

543
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,300
Trust me.

544
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,600
Besides, everybody
remembers high school

545
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,800
way worse than it was.

546
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,100
YOU LOOK GREAT

547
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,200
Welcome Cougar,
class of '98!

548
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,400
Hi.

549
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,900
Jennifer Burton?

550
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,000
Burton?

551
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,400
Ooh, here.

552
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,600
Thanks.

553
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,800
Wait. You're Jenny Burton?

554
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,200
I am if it says I am

555
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,700
OH, MY GOD.

556
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,700
Hey, hey.

557
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,900
Hey, hey, hey.

558
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,700
No one's gonna mess
with you, Sarah, okay?

559
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,900
I got your back.

560
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,400
Wow!

561
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,500
Oh.

562
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's not that bad.

563
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,200
- It's not that bad. 
- Mm-hmm.

564
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
WELCOME BACK 
COUGARS CLASS OF 1998!

565
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,900
Thank you.

566
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,000
Remember, the only difference

567
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,700
between high school
and a high school reunion is

568
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,700
that you don't get suspended
for being drunk.

569
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,700
Want to dance?

570
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,700
Fortunately for you,
I was at the top

571
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,400
of my game in '98.
Oh, a little bit of that.

572
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,500
Come that, oh, and then...
and then mirror that,

573
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,600
you know,
just kind of...

574
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,200
What? What is it? You okay?

575
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,800
So, my buddies and I
checked out the room

576
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,500
and picked the
best-looking girl here.

577
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,600
Decided to come
introduce myself

578
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,700
to the woman I'll be
waking up with tomorrow.

579
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,300
Dick Duffy.

580
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,400
And I'm Chuck,
Jenny's boyfriend, so...

581
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,100
Jenny? Wait. Jenny Burton?

582
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,800
Damn!

583
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,200
Ten years has been
very sweet to you.

584
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,700
Thank you.

585
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,600
Ten years is a hell
of a long time,

586
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,500
especially to someone living
in an eight by ten cell.

587
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,200
<i>How is your dad?</i>

588
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,400
PAROLED 
LAS VENTURAS PRISON 4 YEARS: GRAND THEFT AUTO

589
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,400
Nachos!

590
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,700
Nachos! I
smell nachos!

591
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,300
That's gonna
hit the spot.

592
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,000
Let's get some
nachos. Bye, Dick.

593
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,400
I think that's him,
that's the guy.

594
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,300
- What guy? 
- Duffy. I just flashed on Duffy.

595
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,700
What'd you do?
Attend Bad Guy High?

596
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,600
What are you talking about?

597
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,300
Well, Duffy has some kind of
connection to the Russian mob.

598
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,200
I'm pretty sure he's the
guy that Ratner is supposed

599
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,100
to connect with to hand
off the super-bomber plans.

600
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,000
Makes sense.
He's always been a jerk.

601
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,600
Okay, you go catch Ratner up,
have him set up the meet.

602
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,200
I'll tip off the DJ.

603
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,500
Why? Why the DJ?

604
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,000
CUSTOMER SERVICE

605
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,900
Dude, look at this.

606
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,800
We're in a sweet spot.

607
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,900
People are loving this.

608
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,300
I can't believe
this is actually working.

609
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Hey! Hey!
Take off your shoes!

610
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,500
Take off your shoes!

611
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,700
Tell them
to wipe their feet, right?

612
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,100
Keep it... Will you please
keep it down?

613
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,900
Keep the fingers
off the merchandise

614
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,800
over there, please.

615
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,600
Please. Please.

616
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,000
We got to be considerate
of the neighbors, okay?

617
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,400
No, no, no, no, no, no!

618
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,000
No! No!

619
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,600
This the way you people treat
your own homes?!

620
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,600
My bosses at Langley have
informed me that that's the guy

621
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,500
who's been texting you.

622
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,400
Our target is Dick Duffy?

623
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,000
Of course!

624
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,100
The guy who terrorizes
me in high school

625
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,900
is now going
to terrorize the entire world

626
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,400
with my super-bomber.

627
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,300
You're gonna be just fine.

628
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,100
You have my personal guarantee.

629
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,200
Uh, excuse me, Dick?

630
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,200
I believe
I'm supposed

631
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,200
to see you
about a certain transaction.

632
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,400
Ratner.

633
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,500
You're the last guy I thought

634
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,400
I'd be having
this conversation with.

635
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,200
All right, fine.

636
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,900
Meet me outside
in five minutes.

637
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,200
Welcome class of '98!

638
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,800
Go Cougars.

639
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:18,900
Never should have

640
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,600
stolen the
bomber plans.

641
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,500
I should have gone
right to you guys.

642
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,500
But they threatened my wife.

643
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,000
I wasn't
thinking straight.

644
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,700
You see,

645
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,900
I'm just a guy who likes math,

646
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,200
you know, and
somehow I got

647
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,200
a beautiful girl like that
to fall in love with me.

648
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,200
I have to pinch
myself sometimes.

649
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,300
It's like
I'm dreaming.

650
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Ah, forget it, Agent Carmichael.

651
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,200
I mean,
how can I expect a cool guy

652
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,600
like you to understand?

653
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,200
You know what, Mark?

654
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,000
Sometimes the nerd
gets the girl.

655
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,900
In the middle of something?

656
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,600
Got time for you.

657
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,300
Where's your boyfriend at?

658
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,900
Oh, don't worry
about him.

659
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,200
Can't believe

660
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,300
you're that same Jenny
from high school.

661
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,500
You've changed so much.

662
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,000
Well, I'm still the same girl
on the inside.

663
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,900
Bet you miss your daddy.

664
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,100
He's been gone so long.

665
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,400
But you know, baby,
you can always call me daddy.

666
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,000
Ooh!

667
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,100
That's all right.
I like my ladies rough.

668
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,900
Great.

669
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,600
Now we know he's a perv,
don't know if he's the perp.

670
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,400
Yeah, sorry.

671
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,500
I'm just working out
some childhood issues.

672
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,000
Knockoff watches,
bootleg DVDs.

673
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,000
He came out here

674
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,300
to sell Ratner a dime bag.

675
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,200
Guy's small time.

676
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,600
So if Duffy isn't
our guy, then who is?

677
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,200
My husband spilled everything
to the Feds.

678
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,400
That's him and his handler.

679
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,900
I overheard them talking.
He's some

680
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,600
CIA bad ass named Carmichael.

681
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,000
Kill 'em both.

682
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,500
Give him to me.

683
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,500
Find your own
freakin' fish!

684
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,200
- GIVE ME THAT!- YOU'RE A FOOL!

685
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,400
Norman!

686
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,400
That's it!

687
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,900
Party's over! Get out!

688
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,600
Right now!

689
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,800
I mean, was I born
to be a lawman? No.

690
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,500
I'd say it's more
of a calling.

691
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,000
I got a bit
of the shine.

692
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,300
GANG ACTIVITY

693
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,100
FORGERY

694
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,000
Oh, no.

695
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,600
What's oh, no?

696
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,500
Slight wrinkle in the plan,
got to improvise.

697
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,600
Move!

698
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Welcome!

699
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,900
James Buchanan High,
Class of '98!

700
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,100
Go Cougars!

701
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,100
Uh...

702
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,200
Uh, for those of you
who remember me,

703
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,300
I clearly need no introduction,

704
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,600
and for those
of you who don't,

705
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,700
I'm not up here
to talk about myself anyway.

706
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,900
No. I'm here to talk
to you about some people

707
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,700
that will cause
you to flash,

708
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,300
flash back,
that is.

709
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,200
So, maybe with a...
with a few hints

710
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,600
and a little bit of luck,

711
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,000
we can find two
special Cougars,

712
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,200
and throw some
love on them.

713
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,000
Oh, how about... how about

714
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,400
- this guy, huh?
- Michael Adler.

715
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,200
Drooled his way
through Spanish class?

716
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,400
<i>Se habla espanol?</i>

717
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,600
I know you
do, Michael.

718
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,500
And, uh, who, uh...
who else do we have?

719
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,400
Hey, she is a part of this.

720
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,500
You go. I got these two.

721
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,000
Oh! Oh! How about, uh...

722
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,200
How about this guy
here? Come on, folks.

723
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,900
I know you know
him. Chippy!

724
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
Our one and only Chippy Sternin!

725
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,500
Remember, all-star

726
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,400
pole-vaulter, who was
unfortunately sidelined

727
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,900
- with a horrible case of impetigo? 
- Come on, let's go.

728
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,500
I was rooting for you,
buddy. I thought you were

729
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,900
gonna go all-state,
but you know what?

730
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,200
It wasn't
in the cards.

731
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,500
Come on,
love on those guys really.

732
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,800
Just throw some arms
around them.

733
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,200
Heather?

734
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,300
Who's drunk?
You're drunk.

735
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,300
All right,
fantastic.

736
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,800
Heather,
why'd you do it?

737
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,900
Revenge of the
Cheerleaders.

738
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,900
We marry the geeks

739
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,200
because they're the ones
with the future.

740
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,400
But my husband wasn't
ambitious enough.

741
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,200
And they were offering
a lot of money.

742
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,000
Who do you work for?
I can help you.

743
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,300
I'm self-employed.

744
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,100
Your name has been at
the top of my list

745
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,000
of 'People who need
good ass-kicking. '

746
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,300
Get in the locker now,
Ratner.

747
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,100
You have three seconds

748
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,900
to tell me
where the plans are.

749
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,600
One...

750
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,000
two...

751
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,900
Agent Carmichael, help!

752
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,100
GREATEST HITS '98
Before I go here's a classic

753
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,700
from 1998.

754
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,500
Help!

755
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,600
Let me out!

756
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Hello?

757
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,800
You should've been
suspicious of me right off.

758
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,300
I mean, why would
a girl like me

759
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,800
ever fall in love
with a dorky nerd like him?

760
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,600
You'd be surprised.

761
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,900
Thanks a lot,
Mad Dog.

762
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,700
Always count
on you to be

763
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,200
in the right place
at the right time.

764
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,900
Wh-wha...

765
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,600
I knew you wouldn't let me down,
Agent Carmichael.

766
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,000
Glad I'm not the one
who has to tell Ratner

767
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,900
about his wife's
involvement in all this.

768
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,300
That's why love
is for suckers.

769
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,100
Yeah.

770
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,400
Hey, you seen Sarah
anywhere?

771
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,500
Sucker.

772
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,700
Now, I got to ask.

773
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,400
How'd you wind up working
for the Feds?

774
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,900
I mean, if you had told me
in high school

775
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,300
that Jenny Burton wanted
to grow up to be an agent,

776
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,100
I would've said, "Dream,
jailbird's daughter,

777
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,500
dream. "

778
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:58,800
Guess you didn't

779
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,100
follow in daddy's
footsteps after all.

780
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,500
Go Cougars.

781
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,800
And the queen
of the class

782
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,600
of 1998's ten-year reunion is...

783
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,600
Jennifer Burton!

784
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,200
Jenny?

785
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,900
Where are you?

786
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,900
There you are!

787
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,800
Come on up here, Jenny.

788
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,400
See you at the
20th, Jenny!

789
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,800
Don't worry.

790
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,700
We'll fix this.

791
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,500
It'll-It'll
be all good.

792
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,700
It'll be all good.

793
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,500
Come on, guys,
we're almost there.

794
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,300
Big Mike's gonna be here
any minute. Let's go!

795
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,500
<i>Listen up,</i>

796
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,700
listen up, listen up.

797
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,800
Um, first of all,
I just

798
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,500
want to acknowledge
that

799
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,100
I know that I'm not
the easiest man

800
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,900
to work for, but I want to thank
you for all your hard work.

801
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,800
And mean it this time.

802
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,300
<i>I mean, guys,</i>

803
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,100
<i>what we've accomplished here
is incredible.</i>

804
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,300
<i>And each and every one of you</i>

805
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,300
is a big bright,
shining star.

806
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,400
Oh, mother crapper,
the fish!

807
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,700
Glue's still a little wet,

808
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,500
but we had no choice, dude.

809
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,500
Morgan.

810
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,600
You did all this for me

811
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,300
when I haven't always been
very kind to you?

812
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,500
May I ask you why?

813
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:02,900
I don't know, man.

814
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,200
I thought, you know, if I
was there for you selflessly,

815
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,400
that you would see that people
are essentially kind at heart.

816
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,900
You know, and maybe you
wouldn't walk around

817
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,400
so afraid in this world.

818
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,700
Dude, are
you crying?

819
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,600
Come on, I'm just
doing my job.

820
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,700
Oh, Mike's coming.

821
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,700
Work you've done here
is outstanding.

822
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,300
Everyone's on time,
store is tidy.

823
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,000
Even smells like a
pine-scented forest.

824
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,700
Nice touch, Patel.

825
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,200
Will you look
at these sales totals?

826
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,500
With the kind of brisk
business you've done here

827
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,100
in my absence,
I should go away more often.

828
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,500
Sir,

829
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,000
if I might, um,
the truth is that the,

830
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,700
the pressure of management,

831
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,400
it's, it's
just too much.

832
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
I would really,
uh, appreciate it

833
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,000
if I could just resume
my former position.

834
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,700
- You sure, son?
- Yes.

835
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,800
Yes, thank you.

836
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,200
What the hell?

837
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,000
<i>Norman!</i>

838
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,700
Isn't that supposed
to be a raw steak?

839
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,700
Not on a Buy More salary,
thank you very much.

840
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,700
I did, however,
scrape together enough cash

841
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,500
to get you a cooked one as well.

842
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,100
Medium rare with...

843
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,800
- Extra pickles?
- extra pickles.

844
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,500
Come on, who do you think
you're dealing with here?

845
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,600
Well, I never doubted you,

846
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
Special Agent
Charles Carmichael.

847
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,400
So I guess the big secret
about you

848
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,200
is that you used to be just
a typical high school student.

849
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,300
Wish I knew what happened
to change that.

850
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,800
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
LOVE YOU, DADDY

851
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,600
Nice toss.

852
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,800
Who are you?

853
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,800
I'm the man who put
your father in prison.

854
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,900
The question is: Who are you?

855
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,500
In San Diego, you
go by Jenny Burton.

856
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,700
In Wisconsin,
it's Katie O'Connell.

857
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,300
In Cleveland, it's
Rebecca Franko.

858
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,100
Funny thing is when I looked
at your birth certificate...

859
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,300
I get your point.

860
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,500
What do you want?

861
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,500
Your father scammed some
pretty dangerous people.

862
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,400
I saved his life by
putting him in jail.

863
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,700
Well, don't expect
a thank-you note.

864
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,500
I can save your life, too.

865
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,000
No, not that way.

866
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,300
Your dad trained
you pretty well.

867
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,300
The CIA can do even better.

868
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,200
You like names so much, hmm?

869
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,100
What do you think
about Sarah Walker?

870
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,300
Sarah Walker,
hello.

871
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,600
Okay, fine.

872
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,700
I'll answer one question
about my past.

873
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,000
You've earned that much.

874
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,600
Hmm.

875
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,000
No, thanks.

876
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,100
I don't need to know more,
not about who you were,

877
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,000
'cause as much as you don't
think so, I know who you are.

878
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,800
A girl I'd like to share
a cheeseburger with.

879
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,600
Should I get a knife?
I'll get

880
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,900
- a knife.
- That won't be necessary.

881
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,200
That's awesome
and a little disturbing.

882
