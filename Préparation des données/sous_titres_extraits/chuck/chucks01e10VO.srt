00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,400
Hi. I'm chuck.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,310
Here's a few things that y
ou might need to know.

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,370
It#s hard to say good-bye.

4
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,480
Chuck: brqce larkin from 
connecticut is a spy?

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,960
A rogue spy said he try to contact you?

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,700
He...He sent...
He sent me af e-mail.

7
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,560
Bryce sent me a whole database of government 
secrets that are now locked in my brain.

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,470
Keeping me in a constant state of fear, 
danger and anxiety.

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,150
You and bryce, that's not true.

10
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,130
Right?

11
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,020
It was complicated.

12
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,520
It was nice knowing you.

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,510
It's tommy.

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,810
We have a problem.

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,590
The package has been intercepted.

16
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,820
We're going to have to clean things up.

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,920
Oh, my god.
Bryce.

18
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,050
What did he say?

19
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,040
It sounded like...

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,920
Chuck!

21
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,730
Where's bartowski?

22
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,470
Chuck!

23
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,200
This is walker.
Leave me a message.

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,390

25
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,590

00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,960
Cool.You playing hide-and-seek?

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,370

28
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,740
Oh, dude, i hope she called, 
because you have been really 

29
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,770
weird sincebreaking up wit like, full-on, 
stalker-mode crazy guy.

30
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,340
Kind of like theold chuck.

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,880
Voicemail: message recorded.

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,120
Thanks, buddy.

33
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,280
Dude, what am i here for?

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,830
Am i right?

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,740
Come of.

36
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,190
Open up to uncle morgan.

37
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,490
It's complicated, buddy.

38
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,950
It's...It's just...
It's complicated & yeah?

39
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,810
No.Listen, man.

40
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,180
You like her, she likes you.

41
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,190
Yeah.Wow!
I'm confused.

42
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,520
I thought it wasn't going 
anywhere-- that it was over.

43
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,220
And then...And then we had this...

44
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,270
This moment.

45
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,910
This really...

46
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,000
I mean...

47
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,690
Great moment.

48
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,850
Then, in the moment right after that, 
i realized what a huge mispake it was to break up with her.

49
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,530
I'm...I'm actually going to leave now.

50
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,830
No.Hey, quick question.

51
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,430
It's cool if anna comes to 
thanksgiving dinner, right?

52
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah.Of course.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,100
I mean, you know how ellie loves 
big thanksgiving dinners.

54
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,730
- See?
- Is ellie going to be there?

55
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,440
Well, yes, because chuck lives 
at ellie's apartment.

56
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,560
I know that.

57
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,040
And she kind of makes all 
my favorite dishes.

58
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,170
You know, like, stuffing with apple chips, 
and sweet potatoes with marshmallows.

59
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,160
And i know that, too.

60
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,090
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?

61
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,230
Not yet.

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,230
She...
Scares the crap out of me.

63
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,330
What is that about?

64
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,650
She's got this crazy idea that 
i'm in love with ellie.

65
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,510
'Cause you are.

66
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,710
Why does everybody know that?

67
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,170
Because that's what you tell everybody.

68
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,410
I don't know what to do, man.

69
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,280
I'm...I'm...
I'm in love with two women.

70
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,960
Bartowski!

71
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,070
Grimes!

72
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,130
Does no tang mean no work?

73
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,480
Bartowski, round up your team.

74
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,100
Grimes$ stay close.

75
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,090
Some of you are new, so listen up!

76
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,310
Tomorrow is thanksgiving.

77
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,950
Do any of you know what 
happens after thanksgiving?

78
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,290
The tryptophan wears off,?

79
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,340
And it's time for the liquor to kick in?

80
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,450
No, i'm talking about black friday, 
people-- the biggest shopping day of the year, 

81
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:41,230
when regular housawives transform into 
a crazy mob blinded by door prizes, sales, 

82
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,170
and the urge to get the christmas 
shopping done early.

83
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,290
On friday, i'm reassigning you 
nerds to crowd control.

84
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,920
Be here tomorrkw for training.

85
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,760
Tomorrow is thanksgiving, so wouldn't we, 
as a store, be closed?

86
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,660
You got a key.
Work it out.

87
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,470
Grimes, you know the drill.

88
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,880
- Get these geeks trained and ready for action.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,050
Hey, relax, chuck.

90
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,590
Things are, uh...

91
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,770
Things are looking up for you.

92
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,670
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

93
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,590
And how would that be?

94
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,870
Turn on your heart light, buddy.

95
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,910
Let it glow.

96
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:24,970
I don't...

97
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,770
I don't want to play beckman here, 
but if you don't start answering my calls, 

98
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,060
then super secret spy resource 
chuck bartowski does kind of go to waste.

99
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,340
- Did you flash on something;
- No.

100
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,170
No, i was...
I was calling about other stuff.

101
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,420
You didn't happen to listen to my messages?

102
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,410
Chuck, we have to talk.

103
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:41,930
No.Wait.

104
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,580
- Can i say something first?
- No.Chuck...

105
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,360
It's the kiss, right?

106
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,990
It is.
It's got to be the kiss.

107
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,640
First of all, i know that the moment 
was very life-or-deathish.

108
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,200
And, normally, i would run from 
a situation like that.

109
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,310
You, on the other hand...

110
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,470
You, um...

111
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,470
You...You kissed me, which was just...

112
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,240
But the thing...

113
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,380
The thing is that i'd like to talk about, 
is i'd like to invite you to thanksgiving dinner, 

114
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,250
but we need a cover for that, so really, 
what i'm trying to ask you is, uh...

115
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,650
Are we back together?

116
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,410
Chuck, bryce is alive.

117
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,990
Sarah, you told me bryce was dead.

118
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,070
I read his obituary.

119
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,360
We gent to his funeral.

120
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,800
How is this possibhe?

121
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,550
We don't know, chuck.
He won't talk to our people.

122
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:34,950
Not even you?

123
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,900
Casey: he hasn't seen either of us.

124
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:37,870
Why?

125
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,570
Because he asked for you.

126
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,580
We want to know what 
happened to him.

127
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,080
We think he'll talk to you.

128
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,720
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

129
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,010
Hold on a second.

130
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,250
Well...

131
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,870
You want me to go in there and 
ask him what exactly?

132
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,070
Just so we're on the same page.

133
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,520
"hey, bryce, "why did you send 
me the intersect?

134
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,460
Why did you choose my life to ruin?

135
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,550
" how exactly do i start that conversation?

136
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,080
Just talk to him, okay?

137
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,440
Be a friend, you're good at that.

138
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,660
Remember, he's rogue cia, 
trained assassin...

139
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,230
So be careful.

140
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,670
Thanks.

141
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,320
Who are you?

142
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,780
Hey.

143
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,490
Hey, bryce, buddy.

144
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,120
It's me...
Chuck.

145
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,120
I don't believe you.

146
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,950
What did you do with the real chuck?

147
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,910
I'd like to come out now please.

148
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,360
Natural born interrogator, huh?

149
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,770
Fantastic.

150
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,880
All right, well...

151
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,040
Unless we're in the twilight zone right 
now, and thebe really is another chuck and i'm his clone, 

152
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,580
the answer to your question 
is-- yes, i am chuck.

153
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,050
Prove it.

154
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,600
Tlingan khol da-jatl-a?

155
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,100
Oh, come on, they're watching us right now.

156
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,370
Do it.

157
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,020
Khi-ja.

158
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,860
Bi-piv-kha-low.

159
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,320
What the hell?

160
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,730
Your klingon's a bit rusty, chuck.

161
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,060
Yeah, i've been kind of busy lately...

162
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,940
Ever since i got your e-mail.

163
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,810
You opened it, didn't you?

164
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,590
Yeah, i did.

165
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,210
Your computer?

166
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:37,860
Destroyed.

167
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,680
So you're the only one.

168
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,370
I don 't get it, bryce.

169
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,190
Why'd you do it?

170
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,590
Why'd you send me the intersect?

171
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,110
Then, why did you destroy it?

172
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,660
And last up: how the hell are you still alive?

173
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,800
It's complicated.

174
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,430
Who saved you?

175
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,850
They did.

176
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,990
They saved you?

177
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,020
Did they?

178
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,140
Could you be any more cryptic?

179
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,380
Can i get a name, a place, a something?

180
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,440
Come here.

181
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,640
Don't do that.

182
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,270
I'm sorry, chuck.

183
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,640
Untie me!

184
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,460
Untie...

185
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,280
Okay...Hey!
Bryce!

186
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,910
No!

187
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,310
Sarah, what are you doing here?

188
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,540
Hello, casey.

189
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,310
Care to try again?

190

<font color="#4096d1">Chuck.S01E10</font>

193
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,930
Stand down!

194
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,010
Don't do this, bryce.

195
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,930
We're all on the same side here.

196
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,770
What side is that?

197
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,690
I've got a shot.

198
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,380
No, you don't.

199
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,200
You'll be fine.

200
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,440
No shooting!
No shooting!

201
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,490
I'm susceptible to bullets.

202
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,030
The access code!

203
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,790
I#ll kill him, sarah!

204
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,170
Between you and me, i think he means it.

205
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,790
Five-one-six-zero-two.

206
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,020
Sarah?

207
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,080
You knew i wouldn't do it, right?

208
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,110
No!

209
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,070
No, i did not know that.

210
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,060
How would i know that, bryce?

211
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,030
What are you trying to do?

212
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,900
What's sarah doing here?

213
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,390
She's protecting me, okay.

214
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,170
And so is casey.

215
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:35,840
We're the good guys.

216
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,830
Look, you need to stop this right now, 
before someone, namely me, gets hurt.

217
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,600
Too soon.

218
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,150
We're slowing down.

219
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,090
We don't have to do the whole thing.

220
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,500
Wait, don't, don't...

221
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,450
Stop this elevator...

222
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,420
Bryce.

223
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,600
Who's your friend?

224
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,800
You step back.

225
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,690
Okay.

226
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,550
I wouldn't want you to kill some random person.

227
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,970
I'd feel just terrible.

228
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,450
Tell your people that i'm gone.

229
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,510
This is your chance, bryce.

230
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,150
This is me being reasonable.

231
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,210
Let's go.

232
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,450
Let's be friends again.

233
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,660
We were never friends.

234
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,940
Ouch.

235
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,440
Now my feelings are hurt.

236
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,090
You're gonna run, aren't you?

237
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:24,970
Good.

238
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,780
Who was that?

239
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,830
Nobody.

240
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,520
What's fulcrum?

241
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,850
Where did you hear that?

242
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,220
The intersect.

243
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,600
I have these flashes.

244
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,060
I was right-- you can remember its intel.

245
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,850
Is it always that fast?

246
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,260
What is fulcrum, bryce?

247
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,680
Who are they and how do they know you?

248
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,350
This is my stop.

249
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,570
No, no, no, no.
No, no, wait!

250
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,330
I have questions, i have millions of questions.

251
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,050
Chuck, this is gonna sting a little.

252
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,790
Tell sarah...

253
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,500
It's hard to say good-bye.

254
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,500
Chuck.

255
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,470
Hey, chuck.

256
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,090
Not pretty!

257
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,400
Ugly!

258
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,590
It wasn't a full dose.

259
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,810
It'll be out of your system in a few hours.

260
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,070
Thanks.

261
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,300
I think i can handle it from here.

262
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,580
So, are you and casey 
gonna go after bryce?

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,500
No.

264
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,800
Bryce is probably halfway 
around the world by now.

265
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,750
It's someone else's job to find him.

266
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,570
Sarah, this is bryce larkin we're talking 
about here-- your old flame, my old nemesis.

267
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,490
We have to do something.

268
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,050
We each have our own assignment.

269
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,080
Right.

270
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,180
And i'm yours, so what...

271
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,400
What does this mean...

272
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,160
For us?

273
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,320
Nothing.

274
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,390
You're protected.

275
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,040
No.

276
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,710
For us.

277
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,160
Our fake relationship-- i mean, 
you and bryce were...

278
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,730
You're really not making this easy.

279
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,850
Hey.Hey, sis.

280
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,840
Oh, hi.Hey.
Hey, sarah.

281
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,870
It's good to see you.

282
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,710
You, too.

283
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,750
Are you coming to thanksgiving?

284
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,410
Of course.

285
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,350
On black friday, it comes down to us.

286
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,620
Crowd control.

287
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,840
Okay?

288
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,940
Little test here.

289
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,040
Jeff, emergency in sector two-- move!

290
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,200
Nice work, jeff, nice work.

291
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,940
Lester, converge on jeff's position.

292
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,430
Sector one.Move now.
Go!

293
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,050
People's lives are at stake here, man.

294
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,710
Good hustle, les.

295
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,910
Anna, we cannot lose the doors, okay?

296
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,000
If we lose the doors, we've lost the battle.

297
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,670
Got it?

298
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,140
All right.

299
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,140
You look beautiful today, by the way.

300
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,840
Chuck!

301
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,100
Yes, morgan, yes, i'm right here.

302
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,550
Hey, pal, yeah, listen, 
everybody's moving way too slow.

303
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,610
If they don't shape up, if we lose 
control of the store, we are gonna 
have a pineapple situation.

304
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,280
What's a pineapple situation?

305
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,320
Morgan: never say that word.

306
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,180
- You just...
- It's a black swan.x

307
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,860
It's an impossible event that 
changes everything.

308
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,690
In case something terrible happens-- 
nuclear strike, earthquake-

309
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,650
- anyone of qou could initiate a full 
buy more evacuation by uttering one word.

310
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,520
Pineapple.

311
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,780
The word that cannot be spoken.

312
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,710
I really just want to say "pineapple.

313
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,620
- pineapples are fun-- my dad 
used to throw them at me.
- Pineapple.Pineapple.

314
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,590
Seriously?

315
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,380
Wow.

316
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,220
What's the matter?
Who is it?

317
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,250
Oh, it's ellie.

318
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,690
She's in túanksgiving panic mode.

319
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,660
I got to stop by the store.

320
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,530
- See you kidc later.
- Later.

321
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,520
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

322
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,750
Chuck, where you...
Come on, dude, what about bl...

323
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,650
What about black friday?

324
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,610
Okay.

325
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,730
Captain: chuck, get ready for some turkey.

326
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,040
What are you doing here?

327
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,110
Well, your sister invited me to dinner.

328
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,620
Really?

329
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,380
Thanks.

330
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,720
Did you find everything?

331
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,750
Yeah, i-i did.

332
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,460
Yeah, but i need to talk to you...

333
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,220
I need to talk to you about something later, later.

334
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,530
Um, hey, hey.

335
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,160
Sorry.

336
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,100
Uh, i have a question for you.

337
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,690
Um, what-what do you think bryce 
meant when he said, "casey, care to...

338
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,890
Care to try again?

339
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,750
" 'cause call me crazy, but i got the 
weirdest feeling like it was you who killed him.

340
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,840
Good guess.

341
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,550
Are you ser...

342
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,770
Does sarah know about that?

343
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,190
It's in my report.

344
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,580
Why would you...

345
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,120
Do that?
Why did you kill bryce?x

346
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,970
Orders.

347
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,670
Your old nemesis is a very dangerous 
human being, cúuck.

348
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,180
You get a chance to shoot 
bryce larkin, you shoot to kill.

349
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,920
Guys, no shoptalk tonight.

350
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,060
We got a bird to eat.

351
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,870
Hey, john, can you help me 
stuff this monster?

352
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,330
Cosmo?

353
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,760
Thank you, john.

354
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,040
He's so sweet.

355
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,360
Lice honey.

356
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,910
Uh, sis, morgan is 
bringing somebody tonight.

357
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,900
Like, a real someone or an 
imaginary someone?

358
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,940
Uh, real, actually, very real, 
and she's very nice.

359
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,980
- And, ui...
- "she"?

360
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,600

361
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,460

Morgan's girlfriend.

364
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,610
There could be a little issue, though, 
because she knows about you and morgan.

365
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,700
What are you talking about?

366
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,720
Just remember, it's not my fault.

367
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,270

There's no marshmallows on 
my sweet potapoes.

392
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,920
It's morgan's favorite number two side dish.

393
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,460
I'm sorry, i must have forgot.

394
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,840
Thanksgiving is ruined.

395
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,030
No, no.

396
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,650
Wait( that's my bad, because i did 
pick them up-- they're in the herder.

00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,570
I'll be right back.

It's good.

401
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,370
Hello, chuck.

402
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,160
Sarah and casey are right inside.

403
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,380
One girlish scream from me, and they 
go into combat mode.

404
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,320

405
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,780

00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,020
You...

408
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,240
Live with your sister?

409
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,550
What happened?

410
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,480
Chuck, what happened to you?

411
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,360
Guy who wanted to be the software 
billionaire-- bill gates with style.

412
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,850
You got me kicked out of stanford, bryce.

413
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,030
I need to talk to sarah.

414
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,820
Can you bring her to ma, without casey?

415
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,070
Why would i help you?

416
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,400
Because of fulcrum.

417
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,400
That guy in the elevator, Íhe works for them.

418
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,560
And they want the intersect, chuck.
?????????

419
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,590
Oh, thank god the marshmallows are back?

Thank you.

421
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,220
I made this for you.

422
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,280
Morgan: thank you, thank you.

423
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,060
Everything okay?

424
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,120
Yeah, everything's...
Great.x

425
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,330
Do you like it?

426
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,300
Very much.
It's devastating.

427
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,550
Devastatingly good.

428
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,410
Does anyone else want some?

429
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,910
- no, thank you.- Jo, fine.
- We're good.

430
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,060
Nice and tight, john.

431
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,030
I'm impressed.

432
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,090
You work out?

433
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,560
Yeah, work keeps me in shape.

434
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,380
How many calories do you think 
you're going to burn at the buy more, john?

435
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:58,300
Bryce larkin is in my bedroom.

436
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,790
Captain: you look like a guy who 
needs an adventure.

437
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,680
Two words: water sports.

438
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,700
ãExcuse me.

439
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,500
Sweetheart, is thút, um, tartar sauce?

440
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,340
You're getting rusty.

441
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,730
Bryce, i have a gun-- do i need to use it?

442
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,620
I'm unarmed.

443
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,140
And i'm sorry.

444
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,590
Two dudes, one raft, whitewater rapids.

445
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,330
I got some brochures i gave to chuck.

446
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,700
Hey, chuckles, is those rafting brochures 
still in your room?

447
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,650
What?

448
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,730
Don't worry about it.
I'll get 'em.x

449
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,600
No, no, no, no.
No, i'll...

450
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,210
I'll get 'em.Please.

00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,730
You guys keep, you know, talk...Talk.

452
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,560
Why shouldn't i arrest you right now?

453
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,200
Because i'm not a rogue spy.

454
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,500
Because intersect was a mission.

455
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,380
Because, sarah...

456
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,050
You're still in love with me.

457
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,290
Captain: so, thanksgiving-- we're all 
supposed to say what we're thankful for.

458
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:33,820
I'll start.

459
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:39,590
I am thankful that i am here with the 
most beautiful woman in the world, ellie bartowski.

460
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,580
Good call.

461
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,230
Morgan.

462
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:41,850
Uh, uh, right.

463
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,060
Ellie: that's sweet, honey.

464
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,460
I am thankful for my family and my friends.

465
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,410
I-i-i pass.

466
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,100
Chuck.

467
00:19:53,350 --> 00:20:00,780
I'm thankful that bryce larkin is dead 
and is not currently with my new girlfriend.

468
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,910
Excuse me, please.

469
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,340
Morgan: wow, buddy, that was, um, really...

470
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,520
úark.

471
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,850
Ajd specific.

472
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,230
Well, you've still got it.

473
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,120
This isn't a play, sarah-- i need your help.

474
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,310
Please don't run.

475
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,650
Casey, everything is under control.

476
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,270
Chuck, are you okay?

477
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,900
Okay, i might have made a mistake.

478
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,650
Nice work, cia.

479
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,650
Hey.

480
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,140
No guns at thanksgiving.

481
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,630
It's not thanksgiving without sweet 
potatoes covered in marshmallows.

482
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,040
Okay, ellie, i got to tell you right now, 
i am getting really excited.

483
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,130
Oh, god.

484
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,660
Oh, god.

485
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,770
Oh, my god.

486
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,200
Oh, my god!

487
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,540
So good.

488
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,040
Good?

489
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,540
So good.
Oh, my god!

490
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,350
Fine, ellie!

491
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,830
You can have him.

492
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,030
What's the matter, baby?

493
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,170
Seriously?

494
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,470
I'll go see.

495
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,190
Honey, hold on a second.

496
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,390
- Honey, no more family dinners, okay
- = what do you think about a destination cúristmas?

497
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,400
Anna banana, come here.

498
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,000
Leave me alone, morgan!

499
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:20,880
Come on.

500
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,890
He's gone.
Call it in from my place.

501
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:23,690
I'll check out back.

502
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,340
How did casey find out?

503
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,690
I made a rash decision.

504
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,670
You saw bryce kiss me, didn't you?

505
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,740
I guess this means we're not 
getting back together.

506
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,110
Sarah, why is someone in 
casey's apartment?

507
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,920
Put it down, bryce.

508
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:00,820
Sarah.

509
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,100
Close the door, chuck.

510
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,820
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

511
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,330
I'm closing the door.
I'm closing the door.

512
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,870
I'm walking into the apartment.

513
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,030
Please, do not shoot me.

514
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,320
I need you to listen to me.

515
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,250
Put it down, bryce.

516
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,670
The intersect was a mission.

517
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:20,600
I was recruited by an outfit called 
fulcrum, a special access group inside the cia.

518
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,180
You're lying.

519
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,060
We would know that.

520
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,150
They knew who i was, my activation 
codes, my record.

521
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,870
They ordered me to shed my agency 
contacts and go deep.

522
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,060
Only then did i realize it was an internal 
strike to download and destroy the intersect.

523
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,250
Fulcrum had plans for its intel.

524
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,550
How can i trust you, bryce?

525
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,570
I didn't mean to hurt you, sarah.

526
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,720
I didn't know who to trust.

527
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,530
Why chuck?

528
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,790
Yeah, why chuck?

529
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,330
I needed a friend who wasn't a spy.

530
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,300
He wouldn't know anything about fulcrum, 
or the intersect, or sand wall.

531
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,590
Sand wall.

532
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:04,970
Sand wall.

533
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:05,810
That was the name of the mission.

534
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,910
Sarah, i think he's telling the truth.

535
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,170
Did you flash?

536
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,210
Yeah.

537
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,650
I'm not rogue.

538
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,610
- Casey, no!
- Casey, no!

539
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,290
* bryce!
Bryce...

540
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,830
????

541
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,410
Casey, no.
Chuck flashed.

542
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,220
Bryce isn#t rogue.

543
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,200
You should aim for the head next time, casey.

544
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,410
Hey, i'm o...I'm okay.
I'm fine.

545
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,080
Just, you know, me.
Intersect guy.x

546
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,160
I don't get it, bryce.
How are you alive?

547
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,930
I don't know how they did it, 
if that's what you're asking.

548
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,330
They probably used one of the 
european clinics.

549
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,630
I don't remember it.

550
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,160
But you know why they did it.

551
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,080
Yeah.

552
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,840
Well, should i pop some popcorn or 
beat the answer out of you?

553
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,280
No thanks.
I'll talk.

554
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,130
Darn it.

555
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,670
You know the first part already.

556
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,030
I downloaded the intersect intel and 
blew up the computer.

557
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,730
Raced out of túe dni.

558
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,880
Then, i ran into you, casey.

559
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,640
So i'm on the ground.

560
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,360
No white light, just casey staring down at me.

561
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,420
They brought me back, but they 
weren't trying to save me.

562
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,840
No, this was a fulcrum team.

563
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,580
They wanted something.

564
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,460
Bryce.

565
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,280
Where are they?

566
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,630
Where are the intersect files?

567
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,560
Tell me, bryce.

568
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,240
What happened to the intersect?

569
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,780
Tell me, or i'll let you die again.

570
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,990
I saw...

571
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,860
I saw them.

572
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,540
They're in me.

573
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,700
Save him.

574
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,790
Whatever it takes, save him.

575
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,230
Fulcrum thinks you're the intersect.

576
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,050
They brought me back to take it out of me.

577
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,330
That's why i need your help.

578
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,270
We're going to help you?

579
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:29,310
I need to turn myself in to the cia, 
but fulcrum has operatives in every agency.

580
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,890
I need to know that i'm being 
handed over to the real cia.

581
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,030
I can do that.

582
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,470
I can do that.

583
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:38,550
I, i can be there at the transfer if i 
flash on whoever they send, they're fulcrum.If not...

584
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,320
You're on your way home.

585
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,760
It should work.

586
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,900
Smart, chuck.

587
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,220
They still need a place where the 
transfer can go down, public place, lot of people.

588
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,380
Public spot...

589
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,430
Lots of witnesses.

590
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,540
I know a place.

591
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,180
(customers clamoring okay, listen up.

592
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,970
In three minutes, we let those animals in.

593
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:00,450
If this was a zoo, i'd say run for your 
lives, but this is buy more.

594
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,560
For those days where you did squat, 
this is where you make up for it.

595
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,450
Don't let me down.

596
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,920
This is the single most important 
day of our year.

597
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,730
And my door is locked.

598
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,610
Don't even think about knocking.

599
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,650
Take one.

600
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,130
Take only one.

601
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,020
Hey, are we talking?

602
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,230
Anna, what happened last.Ight?x

603
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,470
It was a test, morgan.

604
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,640
And you failed.

605
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,670
Well, why are there tests?

606
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,720
No, take only one!

607
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,490
Take only oje.

608
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,380
No, take only one.

609
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,700
So, appliances are over there...

610
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,370
All right?

611
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,670
And electronics, you're already here.

612
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,000
Sarah: we're entering the store.

613
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,090
The cia pickup should be here in two minutes.

614
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,750
Excuse me, i'm just looking for camera bags.

615
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,840
Cameras.Cameras are just over here.
So if you want to look...

616
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:28,950
Do i know you?

617
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,690
Wow, dude.

618
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,550
No, i'm sorry, man.

619
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,880
You...You look just like this guy my 
best friend used to go to stanford with.

620
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,460
Uh, sorry, i-i went to penn.

621
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,580
Um...I'll take it as a compliment.

622
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,370
Well, you shouldn't actually, 'cause this 
guy bryce was a real douche.

623
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,920
You know, he got my buddy chuck 
kicked out of stanford.

624
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,840
He ruined his life.

625
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,880
I don't know why he did it to the nicest 
guy in the world.You know?

626
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,000
Anywho, happy holidays.

627
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,880
Jeff and lester.

628
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,810
They can't do it.

629
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,530
They're hiding.

630
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,580
The cia pickup is here.
Chuck, do your pass.x

631
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,110
Welcome to buy more.

632
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,260
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

633
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,360
There were no flashes, 
so the cia guys are legit.

634
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,600
What are you guys doing?

635
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,090
Dude, it is not safe out there.

636
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,330
Someone touched me.

637
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,060
I don't care.

638
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,700
You both have jobs to do.

639
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,520
Big mike: morgan, registers are down.

640
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,870
I need jeff up there to fix them.

641
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,000
All right.I'm on it, boss.x

642
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,230
Jeff, the registers are down.

643
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,840
I can't do it, man.

644
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,920
Dude, you have to.

645
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,970
You're the only guy old enough to 
understand how the register work.

646
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,550
Okay?
They're from the '80s.

647
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:07,640
I can't.

648
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,750
Listen to me.
You're scared.

649
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,360
I'm scared.

650
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,360
We're all scared, but the store is 
depending on you.

651
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,210
If people can't check out, people can't leave.

652
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,850
People can't leave, more people will fill in.

653
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,880
If more people fill in, jeff...

654
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,240
- The store will explode.
- The store will explode!

655
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,630
I got to get 'em here!

656
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,190
No, jeff!No!
No!It's a trick!

657
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,430
Excuse me, sir, can i help you?

658
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,130
Yes, thank you.

659
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,340
These hd screens almost 
look like the real thing.

660
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,610
Yeah, they do, huh?

661
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,510
You know, i didn't maan to 
offend you, last night.

662
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,980
About living with your sister.

663
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,390
Sarah told me about your team, 
what you've done together.

664
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,800
And you're still the superspy, right?

665
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,430
It's nothing.

666
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,630
I got one friend in this world.

667
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,710
You got a home and a store full of them.

668
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,560
So what happenc now, bryce?

669
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,220
You just disappear all over again?

670
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,740
That's what i do well.

671
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,440
Thanks, chuck.

672
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,710
For everything.

673
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:08,980
Yeah.

674
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:10,810
You're welcome.

675
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,830
I'm taking him in, chuck.
You stay here.


676
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:15,770
Right.

677
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,730
Stay in the store, chuck.

678
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,090
Are we good?

679
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,740
Yeah, we're clear.

680
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,080
No.

681
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,060
Us.

682
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,430
I thought you were dead, bryce.

683
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,590
Come back with me.

684
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,980
I have my ascignment.

685
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,320
You were never good at this...

686
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,000
The saying your feelings part.

687
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,330
Well, i don't like to talk much.

688
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,570
Excuse me, can i get some service?

689
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,670
You're charles bartowski, aren't you?

690
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,550
We met the other day.

691
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,410
Did we?

692
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,890
So how, how can i, uh...

693
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,130
How can i help you?

694
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,570
I'm looking for a computer.

695
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,250
You might be familiar with this one.
????

696
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,490
/i> you don't seem to understand 
the situation, charles.

697
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,700
You think that all these witnesses are a 
guarantee that nothing's gonna happen to you?

698
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,360
You couldn't be more wrong.

699
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,470
I, i am so slammed right now.

700
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,150
It's really busy.

701
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,360
So i should probably get back to work.

702
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,000
??????????
And sarah wadker five minutes ago.

703
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,500
I have seven trained killers 
stationed throughout the store.

704
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:53,710
If you look over there...

705
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,500
You can also see that my men 
have neutralized mr.Casey.

706
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,020
See, here's the thing, ÌCharles.

707
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,680
Nothing stops me from ãfulfilling my 
orders-- innocents...Civilians.

708
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,720
If you make me, i'll execute every 
last person in this place.

709
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,600
It's done.

710
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,940
Yeah, we'll need about two 
minutes to groom the area.

711
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:35,820
Where is he?

712
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,670
Who?

713
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,760
Their boss, tommy.

714
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:38,990
Chuck.

715
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,610
Chuck, the registers are down.

716
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,740
I can't get them back up.

717
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,110
What should i do?

718
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,650
You say more than one word 
and i'll kill him right here.

719
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,950
Pineapple.

720
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:00,820
Let's go.

721
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,180
Pineapple.

722
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,440
Hey, dude, don't say that word, okay?

723
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,600
It doesn't have any meaning if 
you keep joking with it, okay?

724
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,110
No, i didn't say it.

725
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,440
Chuck did.

726
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,080
- Chuck?.
- Chuck.

727
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,560
Ladies and gentlemen, 
we have an emergency.

728
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,220
I need everyone to leave the 
store in an orderly fashion.

729
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,260
Anna, pineapple.

730
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,670
Grimes.

731
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,610
* it's a mistake!

732
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,760
Hey, hey, no!

733
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,260
The store's not on fire!

734
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,190
I got you.
I got you.


735
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,580
Morgan, what are you dking?

736
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:32,830
Put me down.

737
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,120
I will not put you down.

738
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,330
Morgan, put me down.

739
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,520
Code black.

740
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,680
Hostiles in the buy more.

741
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,950
I need a containment team right away.

742
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,730
Are you kiúding me?

743
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,960
Some kid could find this.

744
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,710
Lock the doors.

745
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,670
Stay down, chuck.

746
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,310
This is when the shooting starts.

747
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,600
Right...
Right now?

748
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,190
They really are great.

749
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,300
Come on, chuck, let's go.

750
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,250
I'm really getting sick and tired of 
being pulled around by you all the time.

751
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,200
Where's chuck?

752
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,370
Over here.

753
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,910
Let him go...
Now.


754
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,820
Does this look like my first time?

755
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,200
Isn't it somebody else's turn 
to be the human shield?

756
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,880
Tommy: stay there, bryce.

757
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,510
You all right, chuck?

758
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,720
Does it look like i'm all right?

759
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,020
I need to ask you something.

760
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,790
Shoot.

761
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,110
Not you, please.

762
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,610
Khi-ja?

763
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,220
Khi-ja?

764
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,130
Gho-be?

765
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,210
Khi-ja.

766
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,450
Sorry, chuck.

767
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,370
Hi.

768
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,330
What did you say to him?

769
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,720
Ask him.

770
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,830
Hey, chuck.

771
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,250
Chuck, come on, wake up.

772
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,160
Come on, hey.

773
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,120
Khi-ja...

774
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,500
Khi-ja.
Yes.Yes...


775
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,420
I am wearing a vest.

776
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,070
That stings a little bit.

777
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,870
Seriously, that is...

778
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:33,950
Not fair to not tell someone how 
much a bulletproof vest still hurts.

779
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,500
???????????????

780
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,780
Hey, stand down.
He's one of us.

781
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:38,910
let's go.

782
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:58,690
Dude...

783
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,420
Why'd you just carry anna out?

784
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,410
She could have just walked, no?

785
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:05,580
Sorry abgut that.

786
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,220
Morgan, you passed.

787
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:08,950
I passed?

788
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,070
Big mike: grimes!

789
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,180
You just ruined the most important 
shopping day of the year.

790
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,440
For what?For what?

791
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,080
- Do you know what you are, grimes?
- No.


792
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,160
What?

793
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,890
There was a gas leak in the store.

794
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,450
- Gas?
- Yes, sir.


795
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,920
And whoever evacuated probably 
saved a lot of people.

796
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,830
It willtake us a few hours to clean 
all this up, so we'd appreciate

797
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,910
 if you'd keep everybody out of here 
until we give you the say-so.

798
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,310
Is it straight?
Does it look good?


799
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,150
What are we going to do?

800
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,110
Relax, chuck.
These are nsa cleaners.

801
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,290
They'll have the buy more back 
to normal in a jiffy.

802
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,530
Chuck: what's happening with bryce?

803
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,030
He's in there giving his report 
to general beckman.

804
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,340
It would appear, 
i have an new assignment.

805
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,720
As a maitre d'?

806
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,050
Actually, it's a consulate dinner.

807
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,760
They want me to go after fulcrum-- 
on my own, off the radar.

808
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,650
Sounds like heaven.

809
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,430
That means bryce larkin is dead.

810
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,820
And he's going to stay that way this time.

811
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,420
Good-bye, chuck.

812
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,700
This is so weird.

813
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,250
Where you going to go?
Who you going to be?


814
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:28,300
Sorry, not even you can know.

815
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,210
Sarah...

816
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,040
We'll always have omaha.

817
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,490
Hey.

818
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,460
What?

819
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,710
Um, we have some turkey leftovers.

820
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:57,990
Actually, we have a lot of turkey left over, 
so i was wondering if i could interest you in 
some sandwiches or something.

821
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,340
Thanks, but work to do.

822
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,330
Right.

823
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,490
Right, okay then.

824
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,100
Hey, casey, casey, casey, casey.

825
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,090
Yeah?

826
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:06,920
Sorry.

827
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,790
What did bryce mean by omaha?

828
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,300
Outside of it being some weird 
casablanca reference?

829
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,990
Probably a code.

830
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,770
Contact point of some sort.

831
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,630
Okay, why would sarah need that?

832
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,650
Bryce is going deep, chuck.

833
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,390
No messages out.

834
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,840
If sarah wants to join up with him 
she has to do it now.

835
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,480
Sarah's leaving?

836
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,380
Don't worry, chuck.

837
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,320
When sarah's gone, 
we'll get you a new girl.

838
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,180
Oh, man...

839
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,680
This is great, right?

840
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,780
Two buddies, a couple cold turkey 
sandwiches and all the mayo you could want.

841
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,730
You all right?

842
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,680
