1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,700
<i>Hi. I'm Chuck.
Here's a few things</i>

2
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:03,700
<i>that you might need to know.</i>

3
00:00:03,701 --> 00:00:04,965
This is General Beckman
of the NSA.

4
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:07,167
I am calling to say...

5
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:10,701
That you are officially a member
of Operation Bartowski.

6
00:00:10,767 --> 00:00:12,466
I think we're gonna need
a few more days in Paris.

7
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:14,634
No. I want you back ASAP.

8
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,499
<i>Bon soir, Madame.</i>

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,267
Compartment service.
So sorry to bother you...

10
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:56,599
Right. I'll take
it from here.

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,800
Thank you.
But wait. Uh,

12
00:00:57,801 --> 00:01:00,133
wouldn't you prefer
for me to carve?

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,865
I'm pretty good
with knives. Ah.

14
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:03,199
Will there be anything else?

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,399
Actually. You know what?

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,300
I think we have
everything we need. Ah.

17
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:07,333
Very good, monsieur.

18
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,199
<i>Merci.
Bon soir.</i>

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
* *

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,334
Good afternoon
yet again, monsieur.

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,733
<i>Merci.</i>

22
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:31,466
You do know, we have
a full dining car

23
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:32,633
at the rear of the train.

24
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,932
Yes. Uh, we're just...

25
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:35,499
We quite like it in here.

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,400
Uh-uh.
So...

27
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:39,999
Hey.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,900
So you really

29
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:43,633
don't have a favorite band?

30
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:44,733
I don't...
I can't...

31
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:46,132
Everybody's got
a favorite band.

32
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:48,233
What's your favorite live show?
We'll start there.

33
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,132
Music has not been
at the top of my list.

34
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:52,100
Oh, is that right? Oh.

35
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:55,199
Is that so?

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,167
Well, okay, music.

37
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:58,832
Something that we can work on.

38
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,100
Although, that would require us
leaving this compartment,

39
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:03,434
and I'm not sure
how I feel about that.

40
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,400
No.
I...

41
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,767
Beckman expected us
back in Burbank today.

42
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,933
So did Ellie and
Casey and Devon.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,865
We can't just run
away like this.

44
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:22,100
Why not?

45
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,666
Chuck...

46
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:24,832
Casey's been reinstated,

47
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,666
Ellie and Awesome
are going to Africa.

48
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,734
Everyone else is moving forward
with their life.

49
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:31,534
Sarah, for the first time
since I've known you,

50
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,500
nothing is holding us back.

51
00:02:33,534 --> 00:02:37,801
And if Beckman finds out,
she could stop all of this, us.

52
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,499
I can't risk that. I won't.

53
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,965
You're right.

54
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:43,367
I can't go back to
how it was before.

55
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:45,667
Before this, before you.

56
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,966
We should do what I should
have done in Prague.

57
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,199
We should run.

58
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,300
But, Chuck,
is that what you really want?

59
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:56,267
I want you.

60
00:02:57,267 --> 00:03:00,667
Sarah Walker, do you agree
to quit the spy life with me?

61
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:04,534
I do.

62
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,634
Chuck Bartowski, do you agree
to quit the spy life with me?

63
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,601
I do.

64
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,700
<i>Agents Walker and Bartowski</i>

65
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:19,601
haven't checked in
since the Shaw incident.

66
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,833
They were to report back here
at 0800 today.

67
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,734
As far as the U.S. government
is concerned, they're AWOL.

68
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:27,833
Well, we'll need access
to Interpol sat imaging.

69
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,066
Our uplink's...

70
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:31,000
We've been down that path,
Colonel.

71
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:34,233
I'm coming to you because
you have access to...

72
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,334
A unique resource.

73
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:40,800
The Intersect and Mr. Grimes

74
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:44,866
have an oddly
codependent relationship.

75
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,833
I need to know
if they're in communication.

76
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:48,801
Use him to find Chuck.

77
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:57,033
Devon, what are these?

78
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,666
Babe,

79
00:03:58,667 --> 00:03:59,932
this didn't happen by accident.

80
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,032
Okay, well, they're not

81
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,000
coming with us to Africa.

82
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:08,766
Don't worry, babe.

83
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:11,267
I'm sure Chuck will be
at our going-away party.

84
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,533
It's fine.

85
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:14,667
It's fine. If he shows up,
he shows up.

86
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,032
If he doesn't...

87
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:17,865
You know, I'm sure
whatever he's doing

88
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:20,133
at Buy More Corporate
is very important.

89
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,899
Well, I see

90
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,367
you finally made it out
of your compartment,

91
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:33,667
Mr. and Mrs...

92
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:35,299
Charles Carmi... Charles.

93
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,634
Charles Charles is the name.

94
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:39,132
We are the Charles.

95
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:40,832
Charles-ezez.

96
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,266
We-We're on our honeymoon.

97
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:42,965
Huh.

98
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:44,399
Mrs. Charles.

99
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,534
<i>Ah. Enchanté.</i>

100
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,766
Enjoy.

101
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:49,199
<i>Merci.
Merci.</i>

102
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,801
I- I... I blew that cover story,
didn't I?

103
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:54,499
I think the honeymoon bit
might have been too much.

104
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,766
Was it? It probably was.

105
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:57,767
I should have just said
we were dating exclusively.

106
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,466
I mean,
that's a fair assumption, right?

107
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,367
Chuck, we're running away
together.

108
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:07,500
Man, pastries for breakfast
every morning.

109
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,266
Europe is genius.

110
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,567
Of course you're probably used
to this stuff, right?

111
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:14,833
Well, I may have a lot of stamps
in my passport, but I think

112
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,367
this is the first time that
I'm actually seeing the place.

113
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:19,434
Well, where do we begin?

114
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
We can go anywhere,
be anyone, do anything.

115
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:25,400
Well, we could go skiing
in the Alps.

116
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,099
I don't know.
Could be painful.

117
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,667
Although, we could also catch
a bunch of great concerts.

118
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,366
That could be fun.

119
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:39,434
And, uh, if we get tired
of Europe, there is

120
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,633
always...

121
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:42,534
Canada.

122
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:46,033
No matter where we go
or what we do...

123
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,000
As long as we're together,
right?

124
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,434
Raspberry and chocolate chips.

125
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,801
Charge this to
room 47B, please.

126
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:22,167
To not being spies.

127
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:30,644
Transcript by www.addic7ed.com

128
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:09,966
Casey, I'm telling you, I
haven't heard from Chuck,

129
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:12,183
and he hasn't updated his
Facebook status in over a week.

130
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:14,400
Which I can only assume means,
well, that he's prob...

131
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,100
Probably something
pretty important, right?

132
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:17,432
Let's cut the man some slack.

133
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:19,165
He's got the world's
fate resting in his hands.

134
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,767
Oh, I'd say he's got something
else resting in his hands.

135
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:23,165
What do you mean?

136
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,600
Chuck's off-grid with Walker.
Do the math, Grimes.

137
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:29,400
He's going to need a walker
when Walker's through with him.

138
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:31,734
They're having
intercourse, idiot.

139
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,332
<i>Oh. Oh. Got you.
Say no more.</i>

140
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,499
Ah.
Good for Chuck.

141
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,132
Well, shouldn't be
too hard to find then.

142
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:37,699
And yes, I will assist you.

143
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,033
I happen to be

144
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:41,433
the Intersect of
Chuck, so... Oh. Hey.

145
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,734
You seen Chuck? I was just
going to ask you the same thing.

146
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:47,500
So, where's Chuck?

147
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,432
You are on
a need-to-know basis.

148
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:51,367
Dude.

149
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:53,265
Well, good thing
you came to me,

150
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:56,400
as I have been tasked
to bring him back, so...

151
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:58,066
Back? Back?
Back from where?

152
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:00,001
Well, probably better
you don't know.

153
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,466
Whatever. But you know
the going-away party

154
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm having for me
and Ellie tomorrow night?

155
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:04,466
Yes, sure.

156
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:06,066
No matter what she says,
it will kill her

157
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:08,001
if Chuck's not there to say
good-bye, so make it happen.

158
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,833
Somebody say Bat Mitzvah?

159
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:11,199
Hey.

160
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,467
No. Party.

161
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:15,433
You know, there's a lengthy
Hebrew translation

162
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,332
I'm not gonna get into,

163
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,433
but in the olden days,
Bat Mitzvah meant,

164
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,400
"party hard

165
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,332
'cause your daughter's
almost ripe for plucking."

166
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,499
Oh.

167
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,332
Oh, my.

168
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,599
I miss the olden days.

169
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,800
I'm gonna assume
our invitations

170
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:30,767
got lost in the mail.
Jeffster!...

171
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:32,733
...formally accepts.

172
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:34,599
Ha!

173
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,800
Our manager, by which I mean me,
will be in touch.

174
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:44,934
I can't believe it.

175
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:47,567
We're really out
of the spy game.

176
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:49,867
Yeah. Yeah,
it's gonna be tough

177
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:53,233
to just turn off
this old head of mine.

178
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,799
I know what you mean.

179
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,001
It's kind of second nature.

180
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,233
So, theoretically,
if I were to flash,

181
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,699
I'd just ignore it.

182
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,100
That's what we decided, right?

183
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:06,466
Right.

184
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,834
Right, just a couple
of regular people blending in.

185
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:14,001
Just a couple of regular people
doing regular things.

186
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,666
Nothing heroic.

187
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,967
Exactly.

188
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:23,200
'Cause that's what
you wanted, right?

189
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,066
Of course.

190
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:43,400
Maybe I'll just get some fresh air.
You know, I could use some ice cream.

191
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:45,265
You want to go get it?

192
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:46,399
No, you can get it.
You can get it.

193
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,733
I'll get fresh air right here.

194
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:49,834
Good. You know, I'll just
open the window, you know.

195
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,299
There's nothing like some

196
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
nice Swiss air to
get the blood pumping.

197
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:55,265
You know what I mean? Oh! Oh!

198
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:56,466
Oh, that's cold.

199
00:09:56,467 --> 00:09:58,299
That is brisk, but refreshing.

200
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,200
Ah, I'll be right back.

201
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:31,666
Juan Arnaldo.

202
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:34,166
He's a Basque terrorist.

203
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,600
What on earth are they planning?

204
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:42,400
Oh, damn it.

205
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:53,567
* *

206
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,366
Names, dates.

207
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:07,267
What are they up to?

208
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,634
What are y'all doing

209
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,232
in my room?

210
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:46,633
My husband is going

211
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:48,534
to kick your behinds!

212
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,633
This is my compartment.

213
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:54,600
Though I'd be happy to show you

214
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,165
to wherever you are going.

215
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,833
Oh!

216
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,466
I'm so embarrassed.

217
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:01,400
<i>Perdon, lo siento!</i>

218
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:05,067
All these rooms look the same
six drinks in.

219
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,867
We do everything big in Texas.

220
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:08,933
I can see that.

221
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:09,699
Right.

222
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, I'll be on my way.

223
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:12,901
<i>Perdon.</i>

224
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,399
Was just doing
some calisthenics.

225
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,733
You know? I can't
let myself go

226
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:48,833
now that I got the girl.

227
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,734
Right.

228
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:57,199
Oh, yeah.

229
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,166
Yeah.

230
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:09,867
You know, Chuck,
I can't fake this.

231
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:11,466
Not with you.

232
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,332
What?

233
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,899
You've been faking it
the whole time?

234
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,265
No, no, no, not that.

235
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:17,966
I spotted a Basque
terrorist on board.

236
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:19,165
Juan...
Diego Arnaldo!

237
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,833
I know, I flashed on him.

238
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,834
He has a whole list
of names in his room.

239
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,433
Yeah, all of his contacts from
the Euskadi Ta Askatasuna.

240
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,034
Oh, my God, you even make
terrorist groups sound sexy.

241
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:30,166
So, you were the one
I was hiding from.

242
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:32,233
You were the one
in the bathroom?

243
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,300
You know, Juan Diego Arnaldo
is a terrorist.

244
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:41,001
After all, it would
be irresponsible...

245
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,734
Even criminal to turn
our backs on this.

246
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,067
One last mission before we quit?

247
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:48,133
One last mission.

248
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:56,299
Let me get this straight.
Last time you saw Chuck

249
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,099
was in Paris?
Quiet.

250
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,067
Well, hey, you asked me
for my help.

251
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:02,601
No, I was tasked to ask
for your help.

252
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:03,700
There's a big difference.

253
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:05,032
Tomato tomahto, John.
Listen to me.

254
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:06,666
You're looking for a needle
in a haystack

255
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:07,700
made of needles.

256
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:09,634
You need to create
an advantage.

257
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:10,832
That's me.

258
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,132
You know, it can take up
to seven minutes

259
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,865
to strangle someone to death.

260
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:15,732
I've done it
in under 30 seconds.

261
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:17,667
Wow.

262
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:20,267
See, I thought John Casey
wasn't scared of anything.

263
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:21,700
I'm not.

264
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:23,900
Then why are you so scared
to ask for my help?

265
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:25,967
Huh?

266
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,333
Go.

267
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,667
All right, looks like we have
an Oracle based system here.

268
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:34,567
Okay. It's just
I've been studying

269
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:36,399
this particular subject
for over 20 years.

270
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,634
I think I know a
thing or two. Mm-hmm.

271
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:41,833
I noticed that Chuck left behind
his eczema moisturizing cream,

272
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,132
which he needs
a prescription for.

273
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:46,100
Dr. Feldman,
our dermatologist,

274
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:50,467
would've had to call
into a pharmacy.

275
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:52,434
Montparnasse.

276
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:53,832
Near the train station.

277
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,366
Ah, let me see
if I can find out

278
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:57,334
what day he picked it up.

279
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,567
Okay, April 15, so let's

280
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:01,333
cross-check that
with the train station

281
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,832
security camera footage.

282
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,267
This is going to be tough.

283
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:08,167
Yeah, see? This is why we
leave the spy work to the spies.

284
00:15:08,234 --> 00:15:10,234
Uh-uh-uh- not yet, not yet.
Listen to me.

285
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,799
Chuck's a hard-core
DC Comic's guy.

286
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,701
And Sarah, I know, Sarah-
my boy's not leaving Paris

287
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:15,667
<i>without the latest issue
of Justice League. What?</i>

288
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:18,701
Now, where's the nearest
magazine stand?

289
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,534
There. There.
Bingo.

290
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:24,499
Huh, there he is.
There's our boy.

291
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,400
Just see if we can
zoom in on the ticket.

292
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:29,433
Gotcha.

293
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:31,334
They're en route to Zurich.

294
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,033
Make sure your passport's
up to date.

295
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,000
Pack light.

296
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,566
Wait a minute.

297
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,166
I'm traveling to Europe
on the government's dime?

298
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:43,067
Champagne,

299
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,267
langostino,
fully reclining seats...

300
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:47,701
First class, here I come, baby.

301
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:58,400
Casey, I get
nervous feelings when I fly.

302
00:15:58,467 --> 00:15:59,966
Yeah, I know.
Big job ahead of us.

303
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:01,299
Get some sleep.
Can't.

304
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,334
You see, in my head,
the only way

305
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,300
the plane remains aloft
is if I'm rooting for it.

306
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:07,866
So, stands to reason
if I'm sleeping,

307
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,833
I'm not rooting.

308
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:13,600
Whatever, nut job.

309
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:16,234
But you wake me, you'll be
the only one that dies.

310
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:25,467
If we can subdue
Arnaldo and his men,

311
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,366
and leave them cuffed
at the next station...

312
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:29,800
We can place an anonymous call
to Interpol to pick them up.

313
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:31,833
Bad guys delivered.
Day saved.

314
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:36,000
Then we can finally start
living our real lives together.

315
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,234
Right?
Right.

316
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,566
So, what's the plan?

317
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:44,467
We left all of our
spy gear in Paris.

318
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,701
Oh, hey. Sorry, man.

319
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:01,499
Ride on the train's
a little bumpy.

320
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,865
You know, I've even
had a couple drinks.

321
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:05,000
Take it easy.

322
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,166
<i>Oui?</i>

323
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,067
<i>Yeah? Oui?</i>

324
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:25,566
<i>Très bien.</i>

325
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:26,999
<i>Vive la France.</i>

326
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,567
Au revoir.

327
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:32,766
Well, they already know me
as a drunken newlywed.

328
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,199
It's about time they met

329
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,933
my handsome husband.
What do you say, tiger?

330
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,533
Well, I do believe,

331
00:17:38,534 --> 00:17:42,300
you are correct,
Mrs. Charles.

332
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:50,800
Although, I can't help feeling
like we're missing something.

333
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,066
Is all that really necessary?

334
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:57,367
Every world traveler knows that
he should own a sturdy rucksack.

335
00:17:57,434 --> 00:17:59,500
Oh, what's with the stupid maple
leaf patch? Every American also knows

336
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:01,333
to act Canadian
as to be well-liked.

337
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:02,999
That's a cliché.

338
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
We're on a mission,
not a vacation.

339
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:06,700
Well, I'm sorry.
I've never been to Europe.

340
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:08,701
I've barely been south
of Redondo Beach.

341
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,701
Bonjour.

342
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,500
Ticket, please.
Oh, right. Sorry.

343
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,299
What are you doing?
Hold on.

344
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,200
Don't worry.
My ticket is in my super secret

345
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,799
money pouch.

346
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,700
There you go.

347
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,601
Hey, trains and
buses are hotbeds

348
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:27,534
for gypsy activities.
Staying alert.

349
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,166
Thank you.

350
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:32,701
You check the sleeping
compartments, I got the dining car.

351
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:34,666
Move.
Copy that.

352
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:38,633
Whoa. Casey?

353
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,466
Up you go.

354
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,367
Okay.

355
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:51,501
* *

356
00:18:57,967 --> 00:18:59,867
<i>Gracias, senor.</i>

357
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,933
Oh, my God!

358
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,133
Hi, y'all. It's me.

359
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,100
Remember me?
I was in y'alls room.

360
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:12,766
Oh, I don't suppose you would
mind taking a picture

361
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,234
of me and my husband?
It's our honeymoon.

362
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,234
Yes, it is.
Oh!

363
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,366
Oh, dear.
Oh, my God.

364
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,466
I am so sorry.

365
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:20,899
Charlie, baby, look what I did.

366
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,333
I made an oopsie.

367
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:23,466
It's no problem, my dear.

368
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:25,400
Like you say, you
only honeymoon once.

369
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:26,832
This man speaks the truth.

370
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,766
Hey, but still,
apologies nonetheless.

371
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,633
Mr. Charles
and Mrs. Charles.

372
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:32,634
We are the Charleses.
The Charlesezez.

373
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:34,499
Well, either way,
Charlie Charles

374
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,266
does not spill a man's
drink onto a man's

375
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:39,200
cheese tray and not buy
a man another drink.

376
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:41,567
So why don't I just go ahead
and get you some freshies

377
00:19:41,634 --> 00:19:43,132
and maybe another
cheese tray to boot?

378
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:45,267
Oh, isn't he just a sweetheart?

379
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:47,234
I mean, isn't that...

380
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,800
Attention Mr. and Mrs.
Whatever-your-last-name-is.

381
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:58,266
Why do they need a rehearsal?

382
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:01,067
Prepare yourself to be
wowed by a Wall of Sound.

383
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,033
Sound, sound.

384
00:20:08,334 --> 00:20:10,933
What was that?

385
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,633
Damn it, Jeffrey,
you blew the amp.

386
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:13,999
Don't you know
that it's not the size

387
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,633
of the instrument that matters,
but how much and how long

388
00:20:15,634 --> 00:20:16,966
and how often your mother
catches you playing?

389
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:21,167
You know who can fix that amp
in two seconds? Chuck.

390
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:23,765
Guys, I really think

391
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:25,666
you can handle it. No,
we definitely need Chuck.

392
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:27,601
We don't need Chuck! Okay?

393
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:30,399
Sorry.

394
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,865
We're just...

395
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:34,500
We're going to figuresomething e

396
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,133
Go get our turtlenecks.

397
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,267
Tonight...

398
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:45,967
Jeffster! goes unplugged.

399
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:48,133
Um, Lester, that's lime juice.

400
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:53,666
<i>Vive la France.</i>

401
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,932
Here we are.

402
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,099
Sorry about the inconvenience.

403
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,333
Here's your three

404
00:20:58,334 --> 00:20:59,932
fresh beverages for
you, gentlemen.

405
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:01,433
Now, if you don't mind,

406
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:03,701
I'm going to steal my pretty,
little wife back from you,

407
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:05,967
'cause it's been a speck
of time since I whispered

408
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:08,033
sweet nothings in my gal's ear.

409
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,865
Come on, now.
She is a tigress.

410
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,766
A tigress! She just
comes at you.

411
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,299
Come on, baby.
Let's go have some fun.

412
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,600
Bye.
Y'all have a good trip, now.

413
00:21:14,601 --> 00:21:16,501
Okay.

414
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,300
Well, cheers!

415
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:22,799
You know, uh,

416
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,266
I know this is
our last mission,

417
00:21:24,267 --> 00:21:27,434
but we make a great
team, Mrs. Charles.

418
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,200
I'm thinking the same
thing, Mr. Charles.

419
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:35,534
CASEY Oh, God.

420
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:41,166
Casey?

421
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,399
What are you doing here?

422
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,233
Putting to rest any stupid ideas

423
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:47,200
you two might have of turning
this into a permanent vacation.

424
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:50,200
I realize
how this must look right now,

425
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,933
but what you are unaware of
is we're on a mission, okay?

426
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Behind you
at the end of the dining car

427
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:57,701
are members of the Basque ETA.

428
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,600
Those drunk guys?

429
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:06,733
Yeah, they-they look
real threatening.

430
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:14,299
Casey, what are you doing?

431
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,932
You don't understand.
He's getting away!

432
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:18,701
What kind of a chump do
you take me for anyway?

433
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:20,866
Sorry.

434
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,533
Come on.
Coming. Coming.

435
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:23,899
Not so fast.
Wrist. Wrist.

436
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,733
Right.
Okay, go, go, go, go.

437
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Excuse me.

438
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Excuse me. Are you Canadian?

439
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:40,450
Me, too, eh.

440
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:42,132
Oh, man.

441
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:43,566
Sorry to bother you.

442
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,399
Have you seen my friend?
He's about... He's aboot...

443
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,933
Stay away from me,
or I'll cut you.

444
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:52,800
Not such a passive
people after all, huh?

445
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,267
I'll go first. Oh, you
know, maybe I should...

446
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:05,933
S- Sarah! I'm stuck!

447
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,765
Sarah? Sarah?
Are you okay?

448
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:09,967
Hold on, Chuck.
I've got it.

449
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:17,367
Uh, I just got
locked out. That's all.

450
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,166
Hi. Hi there. Hi.

451
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,067
Lovely scarf.

452
00:23:30,133 --> 00:23:32,033
Whoa!

453
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,466
Oh. Chuck, get off me.

454
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:36,666
Terrorist, huh?

455
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,800
I would have thought
two spies could come up

456
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:40,366
with a better excuse than that.

457
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:41,765
Casey, he's-he's here, okay?

458
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:43,666
He's in the bathroom,
I swear to you.

459
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:51,967
Hi.

460
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:55,200
All right, let's say
I believe you now.

461
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,033
Would you explain to me
what the hell is going on?

462
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,832
Hey! Hey!

463
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:12,334
Go. Go!

464
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,033
Run! Run! Get
out of the way!

465
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,334
Oh!

466
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:25,533
That was awesome!

467
00:24:25,534 --> 00:24:27,299
Did you see that hit? Guys!

468
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,200
Oh. Oh.

469
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,600
If you're going
to kill me, just do it.

470
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:33,633
We're not going to kill you.

471
00:24:33,634 --> 00:24:35,634
Yeah, we're CIA, dirtbag.

472
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:37,733
Morgan, probably
not the best idea

473
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,533
to share that information
with just anyone.

474
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:41,900
If you're CIA,
then why did you take out

475
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:43,867
the Interpol agents
on the train?

476
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:46,633
Wait. What? Excuse me?

477
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:47,765
Those weren't your men?

478
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:49,233
Interpol already
apprehended you?

479
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:52,067
No, Interpol was taking me
to a witness protection program

480
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:54,766
in exchange for the names
of several key

481
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,032
ETA leaders.

482
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:57,399
You turned yourself in?

483
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,166
I have been living on the run

484
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:01,100
for the last two years
of my life.

485
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,466
I couldn't take it anymore.

486
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,032
You didn't

487
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:05,366
run this mission
through Beckman?

488
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:07,334
We wanted to do it,

489
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,967
um, under the radar.

490
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:11,032
Why?

491
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:12,233
Because they're quitting.

492
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:13,233
What?!

493
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:14,666
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

494
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,833
Hold on a second, Chuck.
You can't just stop.

495
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,466
Dude, you are a spy.

496
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:19,700
This is who you are, man.

497
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:21,132
You're in the middle
of a mission.

498
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:22,299
Morgan, Sarah and I...

499
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,099
We decided we want
to be together.

500
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,700
So, this is it for us, okay?

501
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:28,467
Soon as we hand over Arnaldo,
we're quitting.

502
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,234
Hey, give me the cuffs.

503
00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:42,199
It's Elia.

504
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,400
The Interpol agents
are neutralized.

505
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:47,067
Someone did our b for us.

506
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:49,133
Meet me in Pundtun.

507
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,167
We'll make sure Arnaldo
and his new friends never talk.

508
00:26:01,134 --> 00:26:02,999
Chuck, what were you thinking?

509
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,499
You apprehended
Juan Diego Arnaldo

510
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,265
without contacting me first?

511
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:07,766
Well, yes, technically...

512
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,266
Your part in this little
impromptu mission is over.

513
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:12,166
I'll arrange for Arnaldo
to be picked up

514
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,833
by a different Interpol team.

515
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:16,201
Try not to physically
assault them.

516
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:17,966
General, just so you know,
we didn't hit them

517
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:19,766
or assault them in any way.

518
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:21,332
There was no physical
altercation.

519
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,867
We just dosed them with
pharmaceutical-grade narcotics.

520
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:25,332
Agent Bartowski...

521
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,532
No, you're right.
That's not making it better.

522
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:28,299
How's she taking it?
Really good I think.

523
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,533
All you need to do Yeah.

524
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,266
is keep Arnaldo alive
until the local team arrives.

525
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:34,532
Think you can handle that?

526
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:36,365
Once Arnaldo is placed
Absolutely, General.

527
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:37,699
Safely in Interpol custody,

528
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,233
you are to return
to Burbank immediately.

529
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,101
And you better have
a good explanation for...

530
00:26:45,201 --> 00:26:48,632
Agent Bartowski?

531
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:50,066
General, General, please know
I'm not hanging up

532
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,233
on you right now, it's...

533
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,699
Well?

534
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,400
Well, we get to hang around here

535
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:01,134
for a little bit longer,
so... vaca.

536
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:02,799
<i>It's like the butter</i>

537
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,700
<i>shot directly from a Swiss cow
into my mouth.</i>

538
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:07,934
And yet...
still can't enjoy it.

539
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,167
I can't believe you're
just quitting.

540
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:11,899
Walking away from
everything. I'm not.

541
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,067
I'm walking toward something.
I can't believe you were just

542
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,833
going to leave without saying
good-bye to Ellie, though.

543
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:18,666
Ellie is going away

544
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:21,034
to do something
that she wants to do

545
00:27:21,101 --> 00:27:22,599
and I'm happy
for her and Devon.

546
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,067
So that's it?

547
00:27:25,134 --> 00:27:26,632
You're throwing away
your life for Bartowski?

548
00:27:26,633 --> 00:27:28,532
I'm making a life.

549
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:30,667
You know I've been
tasked to retrieve you.

550
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,066
Yeah, I know why
you're here, Casey,

551
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,000
and we're not going back.

552
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:35,133
But you're a spy, man.

553
00:27:35,134 --> 00:27:36,299
I mean, this is
the coolest thing

554
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,566
that's ever happened to us.

555
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,967
I know what it means
to make a choice like this.

556
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:43,033
I won't stop you.

557
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:44,934
Thank you.

558
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,866
Unless you want me to.

559
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,599
I thought this was everything
that you ever wanted.

560
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,432
It is.

561
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:51,432
Okay? It is.

562
00:27:51,433 --> 00:27:52,899
But I want Sarah more.

563
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,333
Look, no matter how much I want
to be a spy, I want Chuck more.

564
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:00,100
May I interject?

565
00:28:00,101 --> 00:28:00,933
No.
No.

566
00:28:00,934 --> 00:28:01,999
<i>So I- if I</i>

567
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,299
<i>have to choose between the two,</i>

568
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,365
I- I choose Sarah.

569
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:05,733
Does it have to be a choice?

570
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,499
I don't know.

571
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,666
Excuse me.

572
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:11,101
Look, Sarah has been a spy
her entire life.

573
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,632
And now she's
willing to give up

574
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:13,899
everything that
she has ever known

575
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,365
to be with me, man. Me.

576
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:16,799
Doesn't have to be
all or nothing.

577
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,033
No, I can't risk it.

578
00:28:18,034 --> 00:28:19,265
This is what he wants.

579
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:21,767
And if this is
what she wants...

580
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:24,467
Then I'm not gonna
risk losing her again.

581
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:26,633
Okay. Fine.

582
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,166
Just do me this favor.

583
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:29,265
Before you quit,

584
00:28:29,266 --> 00:28:32,533
make damn sure that quitting
is what she wants.

585
00:28:36,201 --> 00:28:38,201
All right, enough of this.

586
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:42,101
Well, if you two are
gonna go, you better

587
00:28:42,134 --> 00:28:44,233
go now before the other
Interpol team gets here.

588
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:46,033
Right now?

589
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:47,599
Now.

590
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,500
We'll hand over Arnaldo.
We'll handle it.

591
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:51,834
Well, I will.

592
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,466
Perhaps we should all share

593
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:54,966
some nut cake before you go.

594
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,666
Especially you two.

595
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,600
Open communication
is very important...

596
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,767
Shut up.

597
00:29:00,834 --> 00:29:02,733
All right.

598
00:29:02,734 --> 00:29:03,766
Say good-bye, huh?

599
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:04,799
Love you, buddy.

600
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,966
I love you, too.
I'll miss you.

601
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:07,934
Thank you, Casey.

602
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:11,600
Hey. Take care
of my boy.

603
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,700
I will.
All right.

604
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:17,034
Move.

605
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:35,633
* So kiss me and smile for me *

606
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,667
* Tell me
that you'll wait for me *

607
00:29:40,734 --> 00:29:46,667
* Hold me like
you'll never let me go *

608
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:53,300
* 'Cause I'm leaving
on a jet plane *

609
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:54,999
Well, here we go.
* Don't know *

610
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,533
* When I'll be back again *

611
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,034
* Ooh *

612
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:01,766
I got to say,
it's really weird leaving.

613
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,332
I mean, I've never
lived anywhere

614
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,800
outside of California
before, so...

615
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:07,133
Well,

616
00:30:07,134 --> 00:30:10,667
I've lived all over
the world, but, um,

617
00:30:10,734 --> 00:30:13,266
well, Burbank's the only place
that ever felt like home.

618
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,067
* Oh, babe, I hate to go *

619
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:23,934
* I hate to go. *

620
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:35,999
Good job. All right!

621
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,999
Thank you.

622
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,100
Devon, Ellie, you want to

623
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:41,667
come up here and
say a few words? Oh.

624
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:48,833
Colonel John Casey.

625
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:50,632
Agent Simon.
Agent Patine.

626
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:52,567
We heard there was a
misunderstanding on the train.

627
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:53,699
Yeah, you could say that.

628
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,133
Hello.
I'm right here.

629
00:30:55,134 --> 00:30:56,799
So impolite.
M. Grimes.

630
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,000
Can't disclose what the M stands
for. Security. You understand.

631
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,467
So, yeah, yeah. Where you
boys stationed nowadays?

632
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:02,532
Lake Como.

633
00:31:02,533 --> 00:31:03,532
Is that right? Seriously?

634
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:05,734
Lake Como?
Oh, I love Lake Como.

635
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,265
I've never actually
been there myself,

636
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:09,900
but I took an entire plane ride
and read all about it.

637
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:11,332
Check it out, right here.

638
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,900
Yeah, paints quite
the elegant portrait, you know?

639
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:16,067
But it is still
just a book, so...

640
00:31:16,134 --> 00:31:18,667
Tell me-
the Villa del Balbianello-

641
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:21,000
I mean, am I saying that right?
Bell-bell- bellelo?

642
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:22,365
It's beautiful.
Ah, I can imagine.

643
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:24,100
This time of year, I would...
Grimes!

644
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:25,365
Let them do their job.

645
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:26,332
Naturally. Sure, sure.

646
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:27,432
There I go.

647
00:31:27,433 --> 00:31:28,599
But one more question
about Lake Como.

648
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,700
Sagra di San Giovanni-

649
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:32,432
is it just everything
I heard it was?

650
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:33,699
I mean, I-I...

651
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,532
Look, like I said,
the palaces are beautiful there.

652
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:37,332
Yeah.

653
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:38,566
Palaces?

654
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:40,166
We really should go.

655
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,033
Yeah, no.

656
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,332
I've held you up enough.

657
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,100
I'll just go on all day-
"Lake Como, Lake Como."

658
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:46,666
But one thing.
Sagra di San Giovanni,

659
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,265
well, it's this
annual festival of boats.

660
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:49,265
Supposed to be amazing.

661
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:50,466
Dating back hundreds, if not

662
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:52,367
thousands of years.
So I don't know,

663
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,200
I just thought anyone
who spent any amount of time

664
00:31:54,201 --> 00:31:56,101
in Lake Como, well,
they'd probably know it.

665
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:01,699
I don't recommend that.

666
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,299
Oh, Canada.

667
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,200
Wouldn't want to make a scene.

668
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:07,133
Or a mess.

669
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:16,366
Well, after you, Agent Walker.

670
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,333
No longer an agent, right?

671
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,433
No longer Mr. Charles
either, I suppose.

672
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:36,700
Sarah, this is what you
want, right? To run away?

673
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:42,400
Well, I always thought it had
to be one way or the other,

674
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:45,734
but maybe...

675
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,432
Maybe-maybe what?

676
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:48,999
You can say it.
It's okay.

677
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,400
Sorry to cut
the honeymoon short.

678
00:32:53,134 --> 00:32:55,967
But what the hell have you done
with Juan Diego Arnaldo?

679
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:03,933
Guys, guys, guys,
please listen to me.

680
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,366
This is a giant
misunderstanding.

681
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:06,566
We're on the same side.

682
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,266
Enough.
You drugged us.

683
00:33:08,267 --> 00:33:11,000
Interpol did send an additional
team to retrieve Arnaldo.

684
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:13,067
Oh, okay, well, then
I expect an apology.

685
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:15,234
They were just found dead
ten minutes outside of Pundtun.

686
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,966
Oh, my God, Morgan and Casey.

687
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:19,667
Guys, our friends are in really
big trouble right now.

688
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:20,865
Well, our friends are dead.

689
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,466
And you're going
to tell us why.

690
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,367
Call it in.

691
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:27,566
Sarah, we can't
just leave them.

692
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:28,932
I know, but if we're going
to do something,

693
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:29,999
we have to do it right now.

694
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,900
Quiet.

695
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,500
What are you doing?
I'm looking for the cuff keys.

696
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:41,999
No, we don't have time.

697
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,999
We have to run.

698
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,967
Hold on.

699
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:56,400
I want to know everything
you've told Interpol.

700
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:02,634
You should never have
abandoned your team.

701
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,799
Don't you have some sort
of signal you can send

702
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,666
to the CIA to alert them
that we're in danger?

703
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:11,234
The only CIA agents within
100 miles of here just quit.

704
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:35,234
Just stay calm.

705
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,467
* *

706
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:14,033
* *

707
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,200
I can't hit a girl.

708
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:27,666
I can.

709
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:31,400
On your feet. Hook arms.
Push, push, push.

710
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:46,534
That was awesome.

711
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,334
Casey, you all right?

712
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,900
Don't worry, I'll take care
of this one.

713
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:55,835
Don't you two have
a train to catch?

714
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:59,601
Uh, yeah. Yeah, we do,
right, Chuck?

715
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:03,266
Right.

716
00:36:03,267 --> 00:36:05,534
May I just say...

717
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,633
...I've been on the run
for two years,

718
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:10,299
and no matter how far you run,

719
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,267
you can never run
from yourself.

720
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:14,400
And from what I've heard
from both of you,

721
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:17,701
it's not what either
of you really wants.

722
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:22,000
You don't want to quit?

723
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:24,434
I thought that's
what you wanted.

724
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,266
I don't want you to choose me

725
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,966
over sometng that you
want for yourself.

726
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:31,933
I want you. I want us.

727
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:36,899
Do you think if we went back,

728
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,567
and we told Beckman the
honest-to-god absolute truth,

729
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:42,866
do you think we'd really
have a shot at having it all?

730
00:36:45,701 --> 00:36:47,166
Chuck Bartowski, do you agree

731
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:49,267
to not quit the spy life
and be with me?

732
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:50,333
I do.

733
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:51,366
Sarah Walker, do you agree

734
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,267
to not quit the spy life
and be with me?

735
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:55,467
I do.

736
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,233
Good work, Colonel Casey.

737
00:37:10,234 --> 00:37:12,434
Because of your efforts,
a group of Basque terrorists

738
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:14,900
were captured.
Thank you, General.

739
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:16,233
It wasn't just me.

740
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,566
Grimes here

741
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:20,766
was resourceful and quick
to action when necessary.

742
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:24,666
An unlikely pair often produces
successful results.

743
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:26,633
Thank you.
You're both dismissed.

744
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,234
Actually, if I may address
you directly, General.

745
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:34,399
Wow, what a trip.

746
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,334
And Chuck and Sarah,
I know, I know,

747
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,666
they may have acted
impulsively, recklessly,

748
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:41,833
foolishly even, I don't know,

749
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:46,800
but I do know this- these two
were born to be spies- together.

750
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:47,932
Get him out of here.

751
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,833
Ma'am.
What?

752
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,733
Do either of you have
any type of explanation

753
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,134
for your extemporaneous holiday?

754
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,234
It was my fault.
It was my fault.

755
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,467
I flashed and made Agent Walker
accompany me

756
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:02,899
while pursuing a suspect.

757
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,900
I was following a hunch

758
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:06,732
and Chuck was simply being
a good partner.

759
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:08,066
Do you both think me an idiot?

760
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:09,266
No, ma'am.
No, ma'am.

761
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:11,234
Then don't lie to me.

762
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,234
General,

763
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,367
look, I think it's
important you should know

764
00:38:17,434 --> 00:38:18,765
that Sarah and I, we, we are...

765
00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:20,632
Stop right there.
Release Agent Walker.

766
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:23,534
I didn't ask. I don't need
to know all the de...

767
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,466
But I thought you said
no more lies,

768
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:28,067
and-and we... we want
to tell you the truth.

769
00:38:28,134 --> 00:38:29,133
No.

770
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:31,034
General, Chuck and I are dating.

771
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:35,601
Exclusively.

772
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:44,234
I must caution you that allowing
your private life

773
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,000
to interfere
with your professional one

774
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:49,334
can be dangerous.

775
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,765
But off the record,

776
00:38:50,766 --> 00:38:52,800
it's about damn time.

777
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:06,967
Oh, my God,
I forgot that Ellie was leaving.

778
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:18,200
Ellie, Devon?

779
00:39:32,534 --> 00:39:35,300
I've never asked
Chuck for anything.

780
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:39,434
I just wanted the chance
to say good-bye.

781
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:41,633
And he couldn't even
give me that.

782
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,200
I just wanted the chance
to say good-bye.

783
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:50,534
And he couldn't...
Chuck.

784
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,399
Ellie.

785
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,467
I forgot my phone.

786
00:39:56,534 --> 00:39:58,900
I think I still might be
a little drunk.

787
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:00,099
I'm so sorry, Ellie.

788
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,433
I wanted to be here.

789
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:02,632
Chuck, it's fine.

790
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,733
You missed one party.

791
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:12,434
Truth is, I think I got so drunk
because I was upset with myself.

792
00:40:12,501 --> 00:40:15,167
I'm leaving my little brother.

793
00:40:15,234 --> 00:40:18,300
I'm not so little anymore.

794
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:30,766
And, uh, just so you know,

795
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:34,833
you're not leaving me alone.

796
00:40:38,467 --> 00:40:40,032
You guys are back together?

797
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:42,601
We're together.

798
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,033
I think I found the one.

799
00:40:51,067 --> 00:40:52,967
This is going to be
your favorite song.

800
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:08,567
I like this.

801
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:11,900
That's a good start.
