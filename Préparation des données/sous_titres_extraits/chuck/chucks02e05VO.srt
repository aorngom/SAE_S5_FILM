00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,700
Stu Brewster here,
and I'd like you all

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,700
to meet Jeffery Barnes, the new
Missile Command world champ.
SAN FERNANO VALLEY, 1983

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,900
VALLEY VIDEO GAME
CHAMPIONSHIPS

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,600
Thanks for
joining us, Jeff.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,800
My pleasure, Stu.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,100
Now, Jeff,
you've dedicated the last

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,100
three years of your life
to playing Missile Command.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,300
You've managed
to take a video game

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,200
and raise it to a level

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,700
that can only be
described as an art form.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,500
So let me ask

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,800
the question on
everybody's mind:

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,900
What's next
for Jeff Barnes?

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,600
What's next? Uh...

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,900
I hadn't really, uh...

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,300
How can I make up my mind

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,100
when I've got
so many tasty options?

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,300
I've got so many tasty options.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,100
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
25 YEARS LATER

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,200
Jeff, please.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,000
There we go, buddy.

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,200
Score.

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,800
Powwow on the
sales floor.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,300
And one of you two idiots better
light a fire under Bartowski.

25
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,800
He's late.

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,000
Aren't you
forgetting something?

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,400
It's only the most important
meal of the day, bud.

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,700
Of course!

29
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
Breakfast.

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Thanks.

31
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,600
What did I... What is that?

32
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
What did I just drink?

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,400
It's a ginseng
protein shake.

34
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,600
Been used
thousands of years

35
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,500
in the East
to promote Yang energy.

36
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,000
And let me tell you, brother,

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
it does wonders
for your wang energy.

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,300
Great, thanks.

39
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,500
Hey, where were you last night?

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,900
We heard you come
stomping in at, like,

41
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,200
4:00 in the morning.

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,700
Yeah, oh, yeah, it was a...
it was a crazy night.

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,100
Morgan and I stole a car,
and then we drove around

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,400
shaking down liquor stores
and smacking around hookers.

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,100
Relax, it's a video game.

46
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,400
Oh, good... video games.

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,600
Come on, El.
I mean, what's one night

48
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,400
- of blowing off a little steam?
- One nights have

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,500
a funny way of adding up.

50
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,200
I mean, what's cool
when you're in college...

51
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,500
We were just wondering...

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,900
what happened
to all your big plans, bro?

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,100
All that talk about
backpacking across Europe,

54
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
or finishing
your college classes?

55
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,900
You know, I just have a lot on
my plate at this precise moment.

56
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, like what, precisely?

57
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,300
Chuck, we were happy when you
decided not to move out,

58
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,300
but shouldn't your life
be moving somewhere?

59
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,100
<i>It's time for you people</i>

60
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,900
to get moving around here.

61
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,700
Show some initiative!

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,300
Well, I've got
just the guy to help.

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,200
I'd like you to meet
Emmett Milbarge.

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,600
Emmett here's an efficiency
expert, and he's been sent

65
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,900
by Buy More corporate
to tighten your slack-asses up.

66
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,300
Thank you for your very kind
words of introduction, Michael.

67
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,600
I'll be in my office.

68
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,100
Well, it is just
so nice to be here in...

69
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,900
Burbank.

70
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,700
Burbank, California.

71
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Just a real pleasure

72
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,100
to meet all of you
in the flesh.

73
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,200
I personally am

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,600
looking forward
to spending more time here

75
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,400
in the Buy More trenches,

76
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,500
getting to know
the rank and the file.

77
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,600
Unfortunately,
my visit here

78
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,900
isn't going to be all fun.

79
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,600
I'm going to be
interviewing you,

80
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,900
and I'm going to be evaluating
you on your performance,

81
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,500
And, perhaps, even...

82
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,500
trimming the fat.

83
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,200
So... who would like
to go first?

84
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,800
We'll just start out simple.

85
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,500
Why do you
belong at the Buy More?

86
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,900
I satisfy a quota.

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
My dad's part Indian.

88
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,100
The cool kind of Indian,
though, not like Lester.

89
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,900
I used to be
in management, myself,

90
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,200
so I know how

91
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,600
to grease the store's... cogs.

92
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,900
- "Cogs"?
- Make sure they don't...

93
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,300
squeak.

94
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,600
If you know what I'm saying.

95
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,700
ASS-KISSER

96
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,100
Why do I belong at the Buy More?

97
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,900
You know, I'm going to have
to think about that.

98
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,400
I'm going to go
grab a soda.

99
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,600
And... You want one?

100
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,800
'Cause it's my treat.

101
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll gr- I'll grab you one.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,600
And I'll be back in a jiff.

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,500
UNTRAINABLE

104
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,000
I speak more than one language,
binary code.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,300
Zero, zero, zero, one,

106
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,600
one, zero,

107
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,800
one... zero.

108
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,600
PROSTITUTE?

109
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,900
What would I do?

110
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,100
I'd just ask W-W-C-D?

111
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,100
- "What would Chuck do?"
- Chuck?

112
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,400
The chain of command?

113
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,100
Well, there's, like, Chuck,

114
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,000
and then there's, like,

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,100
the rest of us.

116
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,500
Oh, and then there's Jeff.

117
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Sometimes I... W-W-C-D-N?

118
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,900
"Wonder what Chuck's doing now?"

119
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,200
Who represents
the Buy More ideal?

120
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,900
Who makes the trains
run on time?

121
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,300
Who provides your moral compass?

122
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,000
Who holds
the team together?

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
- Chuck.
- Chuck.

124
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,100
Lester... no, Chuck.

125
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,500
- Chuck.
- Well...

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,300
I'm looking forward
to meeting this Chuck fella.

127
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,800
If he ever decides to show up.

128
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,100
Chuck, you picked one hell
of a morning to be late.

129
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,300
- Yeah, crazy night, Morgan.
- Lover's tryst?

130
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,500
Say no more.

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,200
Unless you care to infuse
your story with a more

132
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,300
tawdry level of detail?

133
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
You don't. Okay, listen,
there's this efficiency guy

134
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
who's been looking all over
for you, all right.

135
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,100
So if he asks, you have
gallstone issues.

136
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,500
- That's a thing, right?
- Morgan?

137
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,600
Well, I had to think
on my feet here, Chuck.

138
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,200
This Emmett guy's
been busting my...

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,200
preconceptions.

140
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,700
And helping me see the Buy More

141
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,700
in a whole new...
Hey, hello!

142
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,500
This is him... Chuck.

143
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,100
We finally meet, Chuck.

144
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Hi.

Are you feeling all right?

148
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
No- yes!

149
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,600
Yes, I'm fine.

150
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,800
Actually on second thought,

151
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,400
<i>I think my gallstones
are acting up, so...</i>

152
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,300
Hi.

153
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,600
Do you know this man?

154
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,800
No. No, never

155
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,300
seen him before
in my life.

156
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,300
Wait a minute.
Is that one of the sweat hogs

157
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,400
<i>from Welcome Back, Kotter?</i>

158
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,700
He is a Buy More employee.

159
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,400
You know, he doesn't work
at this store.

160
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,300
But you should check out
one of our other

CLASSIFIED
born in the Asir Province, 1974.

168
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,600
The past ten years,
he's been hopping

169
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,900
between training camps
from Syria to Somalia.

170
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,100
What does a global terrorist
want with a nerd like Jeff?

171
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,500
Insightful question,
Bartowski.

172
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,000
It's why we have
an Intersect.

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,300
We want you to approach
Jeff socially.

174
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,600
Get to know him
better and see

175
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,700
if you can get
him to open up

176
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,800
about his past.

177
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,300
You want me to hang out
with Jeff?

178
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,900
It's either that, or we throw
him in the back of a van

179
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,300
and have an agency interrogation
team go to work on him.

180
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,200
Great, so it comes down
to either torturing him

181
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,400
or torturing me?

182
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,200
Looks like we got a bogey.

183
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,800
Sarah?

184
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,000
Is that my sister?

185
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,800
Ellie, what a surprise.

186
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,500
Yeah, I was just driving around

187
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,100
I thought it'd
be nice, uh...

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,900
I thought it would be nice
if you and I could talk

189
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,500
without Chuck, actually.

190
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,500
Oh, okay.

191
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,500
Not polite
to spy, Chuck.

192
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,300
I would hate it if he found out
that I was going

193
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,400
behind his back
like this.

194
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,500
Oh, well, your secret
is safe with me.

195
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,900
Do you know if he has any plans?

196
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,800
Tonight?

197
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,500
Uh, actually, I think he is
hanging out with Jeff.

198
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Nerd Herd, creepy, serial-killer
Jeff?

199
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,200
Yeah.

200
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,100
I think it's time
that you and I had a talk.

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,700
I hope you enjoyed
your fro-yo?

202
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,500
Ha. Yeah, I was,
uh, just seeing my girlfriend.

203
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,100
Girlfriend? Oh...

204
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,100
I, too, have
a special lady friend.

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,200
Henrietta.

206
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,300
She works in our Ontario branch,
accounts payable.

207
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,400
She's a real tigress.

208
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,500
Well, now that
we've gotten the topic

209
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
of our love life out of the way,

210
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,100
perhaps you'd like to sit
down for our interview.

211
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,700
How is tomorrow?

212
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
'Cause I'm really more
of a morning person.

213
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,300
I'll be the judge of that.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Hey, buddy.
Where are you going?

215
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,300
What'd I do?

216
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,700
Nothing! No.

217
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
You know... nothing.

218
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,900
Just... you know, we never
really get the chance to talk.

219
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,000
How about we grab a beer?

220
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,200
No, thanks.

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,400
I could be enticed
to grab a dozen beers, however.

222
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,900
It's a date.

223
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,500
We can kick it at my place.

224
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,900
You're going
to love Roscoe.

225
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,100
He's my ferret.

226
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,500
Ooh... you know what?

227
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,900
I'm actually allergic

228
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,800
to any and every member
of the polecat family.

229
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,900
So maybe we can kick it here?

230
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,500
Sure.

231
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,600
- Hmm.
- Hmm...

232
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,200
Following a thorough inspection
of the branch,

233
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,900
there seems to be no sign

234
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,100
of intelligent life.

235
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,800
May I present

236
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,400
tonight's feature entertainment.

237
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,200
You made an Anna music video?

238
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,300
You like?

239
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Wow.

240
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,200
It's really-

241
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,900
Wow.

242
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,100
I know, man.

243
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,000
She's my muse.

244
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,100
Now, if you'll excuse me.

245
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,100
I'm going to slip
into my drinking pants.

246
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,900
Look at that!

247
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,900
Abort mission.
Extraction required.

248
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,500
The Intersect
has been compromised.

249
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,300
Negative.
Perimeter is secure.

250
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,100
<i>I'm talking about the weirdo
inside the Buy More!</i>

251
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,000
<i>I'm starting to think</i>

252
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,100
that there's something
going on with my brother.

253
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,900
Oh.

254
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,100
Why?

255
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
What do you mean?

256
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,300
It's just
everything seemed

257
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,100
to be moving along
just fine for Chuck.

258
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,300
And you had everything
to do with that.

259
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,400
Oh, thanks,

260
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
but, uh, I-I can't
take the credit.

261
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,200
Then, I don't know,
it's like...

262
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,400
it's like he's slipping
back into old Chuck mode.

263
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,500
You know, no
confidence.

264
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,800
No direction.
It's-

265
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,900
it's the Morgan
Years revisited.

266
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,800
I mean he went to
Stanford, for God's sakes.

267
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,500
Did you know that he's 12
credits short of graduating?

268
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,200
12 credits short of a real life.

269
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
I know that I sound
like his mother.

270
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,200
Just tell me that I don't have

271
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,900
anything to worry about
and I will lay off.

272
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,700
Pound! Pound! Pound!

273
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,400
Go! Yes!

274
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,700
Pound! Pound!

275
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,200
Quit being such
a lightweight!

276
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,400
Resuming dictation.

277
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,100
Yes! Yes!

278
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,900
I'd like to report the following
violation of Buy More policy:

279
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,600
misappropriation

280
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
of the home theater room,

281
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,000
after hours

282
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,800
consumption of alcohol.

283
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,200
And lewd use
of a musical montage.

284
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,300
I'm going hohome at once
to file this report.

285
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,800
Crazy thing happened today.

286
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Uh, some dude came into the
store looking for you.

287
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,500
He had this goofy,

288
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,200
old picture and
everything.

289
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,400
Only a matter of time, I guess.

290
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,200
What?

291
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,700
You mean you
know the guy?

292
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,000
I'd imagine...

293
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,400
he's one of my fans.

294
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,500
You want to see something
I've never shared with anyone?

295
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
Please don't be a porno.

296
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,200
- Please, please don't be a porno.
- And I'd like you all

297
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,000
to meet Jeffery Barnes.

298
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,500
The new Missile Command
world champ.

299
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,200
Missile Command?

300
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,000
I used to kick ass at that game.

301
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, I was the best.

302
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,800
By breaking the all-time record,

303
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,100
you've won $100 in quarters

304
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,700
and a year's supply
of Slim Jim's.

305
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,100
This prize will be presented

306
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,300
by none other
than Mr. Morimoto, CEO

307
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,900
and chief engineer
at Atari games.

308
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,400
Dude, you are
so wasted.

309
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,200
FACIAL SCANNING

310
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,500
COMPLETE
FARROKH BULSARA

311
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:13,900
What is it

312
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
about bad guys and vans?

313
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,500
Okay.

314
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,500
Okay, Chuck,
party's over.

315
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,000
Hey, hey,

316
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,200
I- I flashed! Some guy
on the TV. He's a video...

317
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,900
Later, Chuck. We have guests.
Out the back door. Now!

318
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,700
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, what about Jeff? 
- What about him?

319
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,800
- We can't just leave him here.
- He's deadweight.

320
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
You weren't kidding.

321
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,000
Go! Go!

322
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,700
He pukes on my
upholstery,

323
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,500
he's gonna wish we left him
with the terrorists.

324
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
Search the place.

325
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,300
<i>Should I be worried about him?</i>

326
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,700
You know, um, Chuck is, uh...

327
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,500
Chuck is like a duck.

328
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,700
Sometimes

329
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,800
it seems like
he is just gliding along,

330
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,000
but beneath the surface,

331
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,100
his, uh... his little feet
are-are just

332
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,000
paddling away like crazy.

333
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,500
Deep down,

334
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,000
I really think
Chuck is an incredibly mature

335
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,100
and responsible guy.

336
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,500
Chuck?

337
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,500
Oh!

338
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,300
- Oh, 
- is he okay?

339
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,700
Yeah. Don't worry.
This guy's feeling no pain.

340
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,100
Ouch.

341
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,800
Here we go. Here we go.

342
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,000
Big boy. Big boy.

343
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,900
What's up, ladies?

344
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,600
You take the brunette.

345
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,600
I'm gonna take a crack
at the blonde.

346
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,700
???

347
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,700
Oh...! Jeff!

348
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,300
I'm, uh, supposed
to give this to you.

349
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,100
MY NAME IS JEFF AND I'M LOST

350
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,400
Okay.

351
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,000
Is that your address?

352
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,900
- Yeah. 
- All right, we're gonna get you a cab.

353
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,600
Already have.
Already here. Thank you.

354
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,900
Great. Awesome.
Come on, Jeff.

355
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,500
That was a great
time last night, huh?

356
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,100
You got smashed
and passed out,

357
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,600
and we just watched, and
it was really awkward.

358
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,900
Okay, here
you go, buddy.

359
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,100
Get home safe.

360
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,100
Chuck.

361
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,900
We're about to have one of
those conversations, aren't we?

362
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,300
Well, if I wasn't
worried enough,

363
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,000
last night's
performance was...

364
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,800
Not... Not one of
my proudest moments.

365
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Uh-uh.

366
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,300
I feel like you left
all those back at Stanford.

367
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,300
I'm sorry. I just...

368
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,500
You were so close to graduating.

369
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,200
You know, maybe if you just
went back and finished,

370
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,700
you could move on
to the next phase.

371
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,500
I mean, if the world
were gonna end today,

372
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,800
- why would you want to...? 
- I- I hear you.

373
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,100
I really do.

374
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,900
But all those goals
I used to have-

375
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,700
I still have 'em.

376
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,400
Okay.

377
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Hey, sis?

378
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,900
The world's not gonna end today.

379
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,800
I have very reliable sources.

380
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,400
Wild night,
huh, buddy?

381
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,600
Nah. Pretty
standard Tuesday.

382
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,200
This is bad.
This is very bad.

383
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,000
Can't you see
that we're losing them, man?

384
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,500
I'm your best friend, Jeff.

385
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,700
No, I'm your best
friend, Chuck!

386
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,100
Oh, isn't life grand!

387
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,300
Maybe we should form
an alliance.

388
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,300
You and me could be
best friends?

389
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,100
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, dude.

390
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,600
Let's not, uh...

391
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,700
Let's not panic
here, okay?

392
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,800
Thanks, man.

393
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,700
Well, you know...

394
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,600
It was very
comfortable.

395
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,700
Sure.

396
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Excuse me.

397
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,000
We need to talk.

398
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,900
My sister thinks
I'm an idiot, I know.

399
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,900
Actually, we just got
some fresh intel

400
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,100
on your favorite
video game designer.

401
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,500
There were a few things
Morimoto left out of his bio.

402
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah. Guy secretly worked
for Japanese military.

403
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,700
In 1980, they
launched Morimoto's

404
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,500
first-generation
weapons satellite.

405
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,400
The guy who created
Missile Command

406
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,900
commands
actual missiles?

407
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,000
Via satellite.

408
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,900
It's still up there-

409
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,700
dormant,
but presumed operational.

410
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,100
Anyone knows how

411
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,000
to fire that puppy up,
it's Morimoto.

412
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,500
And you think he's working
with Farrokh and the terrorists?

413
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,000
Well, he hasn't been seen
in years.

414
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,200
We captured this image
outside Morimoto's office

415
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,500
about an hour ago.

416
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
What about Jeff?

417
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,800
How is he supposed
to be involved in all this?

418
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,900
The only way
to find out is

419
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,000
to get into
Atari headquarters.

420
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Security's going to be tight.

421
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,300
But if we don't
secure the satellite,

422
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,100
then Jeff's safety is gonna be
the least of our concerns.

423
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,500
So how do you want to do this?

424
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,400
Guys...

425
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,200
I have an idea.

426
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,700
All right, be
cool, Casey.

427
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,200
Have you seen
what I'm wearing?

428
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,500
Just let me do
the talking, okay?

429
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,700
These are my people-
programmers, nerds.

430
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,200
And right now, their
network is being attacked

431
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,100
by a particularly
nasty virus.

432
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,800
Back at Stanford, we called
it the Bartowski special.

433
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,400
Yeah, real cool
there, Chuck.

434
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,600
Damn computers are out
all over the building.

435
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,900
Gentlemen,
excuse me.

436
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,200
What do you want?

437
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,700
We heard you're having
a computer problem.

438
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,100
Someone
called. Bill?

439
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Bob... I can't
remember,

440
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,800
exactly; it was a
very common name.

441
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,500
- Yeah, we got it covered.
- Mind if I take a peek?

442
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,400
Look, nerd,

443
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,800
Atari has
more Ph. D.s

444
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,400
than friggin'
Microsoft.

445
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,900
Yeah. Why don't you help

446
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,100
some old lady log onto AOL?

447
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,100
Nice one. Ooh!

448
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Plan B.

449
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,900
Hi.

450
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,300
I hear you're having
a computer problem.

451
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,200
See, if I could just get
onto that terminal, I could

452
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
set off the fire alarm,
I couldcrash the power,

453
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,300
create a diversion.

454
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:53,900
Or we could just

455
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,100
take the stairs.

456
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,000
Looks like
Agent Walker's

457
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,600
got the diversion
pretty well covered.

458
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,800
Sarah doesn't even know
how to fix a computer.

459
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,900
The second she touches
that machine, our cover's blown.

460
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,800
The CPUs have been
massively overvolted,

461
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,200
but we may be able to ghost
the drive on another system.

462
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,900
The more elegant solution
would be to flash the BIOS

463
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,700
and swap out
the cooked CPU.

464
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,600
What are you guys waiting for?

465
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,600
Okay. I'm gonna
see if I can find

466
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,900
another way into
the penthouse.

467
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,300
You wait here
where it's safe.

468
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,000
This place is creepy.

469
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,100
So creepy.

470
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,700
Well, if it isn't my friend
from the Buy More.

471
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,800
What a funny coincidence

472
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,000
finding you here.

473
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,500
Yeah, it's
freakin' hilarious.

474
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,200
What a small world, right?

475
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,800
I got a... I got a
call about a computer

476
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,400
that was acting
up here, and so...

477
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
In fact, is this
the right floor?

478
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
I don't even
know if it's...

479
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,300
You have the correct floor.

480
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,100
- This way. Please. 
- You know if you're busy,

481
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,300
I can come back
another time.

482
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,700
Uh-uh. You're timing
was perfect.

483
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,700
I hope

484
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,700
the machine doesn't give you
too much trouble.

485
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,600
* What you say
about his company *

486
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,800
* Is what you say
about society *

487
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,800
* Catch the mist,
catch the myth *

488
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,800
* Catch the mystery,
catch the drift *

489
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,100
You should not be here.

490
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,100
Um, uh...

491
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,600
* The world is,
the world is... *

492
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,900
Mr. Morimoto?

493
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,500
You listening
to Rush?

494
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,700
You are too late.

495
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,800
He took the code.

496
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,800
Who are they, terrorists?

497
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,100
I knew I should've
never hidden

498
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,500
the numbers inside
the machine.

499
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,800
You hid the satellite code

500
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,700
inside a game of
Missile Command?

501
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,800
Every game, hidden
in the final board.

502
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
The kill screen.

503
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
A secret level
only I could achieve.

504
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,900
The mathematics underlying
the final board

505
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,500
are too advanced.

506
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,500
It's like the music
of the universe.

507
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,100
Hands up.

508
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,600
I am sorry, I
cannot do that.

509
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,300
- What's going on here, Chuck? 
- Wait.

510
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,500
Wait, if the bad guys
have the code,

511
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,300
why are you still
playing the game?

512
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,100
Uh-oh.

513
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,900
We're running out of time!

514
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,400
SAVE YOURSELVES!

515
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,900
- Let's get out of here, Chuck.
- No, we can't just leave him here.

516
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,500
- Not this time.
- No, no, no, wait!

517
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,300
Go, go, go!
It's a... wait, wait!

518
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,000
THE END

519
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,600
General, we're
sorry to report

520
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,000
that Farrokh and his
team have the code.

521
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,600
That, and they murdered
Morimoto.

522
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,700
That means that your duties
are no longer required

523
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,800
on this operation.

524
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,500
Casey,

525
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,700
we're turning this matter
over to the 30th Space Wing

526
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,700
at Vandenberg.

527
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Wait, you're launching an ICBM?

528
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,500
You think you can shoot
down that satellite

529
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
before it
shoots us?

530
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,200
Morimoto's satellite
will be passing

531
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,600
over California in four hours.

532
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,800
Best case,
we shoot it down

533
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,000
off the coast before its own
missiles are armed.

534
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,300
The satellite
falls to Earth

535
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,200
with acceptable
civilian casualties.

536
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,800
Wait a second, acceptable what?

537
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,600
I'd like to hear
the bad version.

538
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,600
We miss.

539
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,500
What happens then?

540
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,000
Farrokh uses
Morimoto's satellite

541
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,700
to start World War III.

542
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Hey, what about the...
what about the kill screen?

543
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,500
- Excuse me? - Missile Command - Morimoto said

544
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,200
that the code is hidden
in every arcade game.

545
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
If we can get to the kill
screen, we can get the code,

546
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,900
and then we can take control
of the satellite.

547
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,500
We'll have our engineers
take a...

548
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
No, look, the only way to get
the code is by beating the game,

549
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,900
and the only person
who can beat the game...

550
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,500
- Is 
- burned to a crisp.

551
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,700
- I was talking about Jeff.
- So was I.

552
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,800
Casey, you coordinate
with the Air Force

553
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,100
while Mr. Bartowski

554
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,700
pursues his...
contingency plan.

555
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,600
But I promise you,
one way or another,

556
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,700
I am bringing
that satellite down.

557
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,600
You want me
to come out

558
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,100
of Missile Command
retirement?

559
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,000
You're serious?

560
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,900
Deadly.

561
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,400
I don't know, man.

562
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,000
Come on, what's
the problem?

563
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,800
I guess I'm just cool
with resting on my laurels

564
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,200
- and whatnot.
- But Jeff...

565
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,100
you could be
the first guy

566
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,000
to ever get to
the kill screen.

567
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,000
Listen, it doesn't exist.

568
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,200
The kill screen's just a myth.

569
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,700
I promise you, it's real,
and you're the only one

570
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,800
who can do it.

571
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm a little out
of shape, mentally.

572
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,500
Jeff, it's just a
stupid video game!

573
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,000
That's where
you're wrong, Chuck.

574
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,500
It's more
than a game.

575
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Besides, what do you care
whether I play or not?

576
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,500
I guess I was just really moved
by what you said last night.

577
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
- Huh?
- Oh, you remember.

578
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,500
Come on.

579
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,500
How you were
sick and tired

580
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,200
of busting your ass
at this stupid store.

581
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,800
How you had this
incredible gift

582
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,100
that you couldn't wait
for the world to see.

583
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,500
Really? I said that?

584
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Sure you did, Jeff.

585
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,700
About Missile Command?

586
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,200
You were very compelling.

587
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,700
Okay, I'll do it.

588
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,800
- I'll play.
- Buddy...

589
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,800
But first,
I'm gonna need provisions.

590
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
I need two bottles
grape cough syrup,

591
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,300
one pound M&Ms, no brown,

592
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,600
and my lucky arcade game from
the Gas 'N Sip in Tarzana.

593
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,600
Done.

594
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,200
Really?

595
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,700
I want Anna
wearing a hula skirt

596
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,100
fanning me with a palm frond.

597
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,300
- HUH? 
- I sweat profusely when I play.

598
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,500
And finally,

599
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,100
I need a crowd.

600
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,400
- I want you to get some of my old fans back. 
 - Come on.

601
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,300
The people that were into that
game are in their 40s now.

602
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,700
They have jobs, and wives,

603
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,900
and kids and...

604
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,100
Hey, hey, hey-
Morgan, buddy.

605
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,400
Can you give me
a hand with this?

606
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,200
Why don't you just
go ask your buddy, Jeff?

607
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,400
He's in the break room.

608
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,800
We're putting together
this like video game

609
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,300
exhibition-thingy
this afternoon.

610
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,200
Jeff's gonna make a run

611
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,400
at the all-time
Missile Command high score.

612
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
- Whoa.
- Hey, where are you going?

613
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,400
Sounds like you two guys
got it all worked out.

614
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,000
Morgan, I desperately
need your help, okay?

615
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,400
If Jeff doesn't break
the Missile Command record...

616
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,900
What, Chuck?
The world's gonna end?

617
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,600
Look, all I know
is that I need your help.

618
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,400
Okay, I can't do this
without you, buddy.

619
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,000
I can't.

620
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,500
Hey, hey, was Jeff...

621
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,400
was Jeff the president
of his high school

622
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,000
audio/video club?

623
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,100
Doubt it.

624
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,400
<i>Was Jeff a roadie
for Mamma Mia</i>

625
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,000
for four
straight summers?

626
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,800
Does Jeff own
his own smoke machine?

627
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,700
- No, but I do. Okay.
- Huh?

628
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,100
Jeff is a loser, dude.

629
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,200
I'll see what I can do.

630
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,100
You're the best, buddy.

631
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,300
Oh, and I'm gonna need
to borrow your girlfriend.

632
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,000
- Oh, dude, she's all yours.
- Great.

633
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,800
JEFF BARNES TO PLAY EXHIBITION!

634
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,000
MISSILE COMMAND

635
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,900
JEFF BARNES TO PLAY EXHIBITION!
MISSILE COMMAND

636
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,600
THE GREAT ONE RETURNS
 JEFF BARNES AT BUY MORE ASAP!

637
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,100
Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!

638
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,600
Jeff! Jeff!
Jeff! Jeff!

639
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,300
I'm here at a Burbank
electronics store

640
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,200
where a local man
prepares to break

641
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,300
the Missile Command record.
BLAST FROM THE PAST 
A FADING STAR SEEKS NEW GLORY

642
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,900
Now for those of you

643
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,400
who weren't around
a quarter century ago,

644
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,100
Jeffrey Barnes
first made his mark on...

645
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,300
...way back in 1983.

646
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,800
Sarah, Sarah-
I know where Farrokh is.

647
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,500
The terrorists are using
a television station

648
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
to control the satellite;
they're here in L.A.

649
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,600
<i>Chuck flashed.</i>

650
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,500
<i>He knows where they're
controlling the satellite.</i>

651
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,900
There is still time

652
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,600
before the satellite
is in range.

653
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,200
Maybe Chuck's right,
but there's nothing you can do

654
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
to stop it without the code.

655
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,900
Well, I'm going to go
to the news station.

656
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,700
Knock yourself out.
I have my orders.

657
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,900
33 minutes and five
seconds, this finger

658
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,300
gonna push
that button.

659
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,000
Hmm. I'll call you
from the road.

660
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,100
- Agent Walker.
- Yes.

661
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,800
Who do you trust to bring down
a rogue satellite more:

662
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,700
some burnout loser
playing a video game

663
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,700
or an Air Force ICBM?

664
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,200
I trust Chuck.

665
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,500
Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!

666
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,300
I'd like you all to meet

667
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,600
Jeffrey Barnes.

668
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,700
Uh...

669
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,100
Missile Command

670
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,800
world champ.

671
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,300
I don't feel so hot.

672
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,600
What? No, no, no.

673
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,900
You're gonna be great.
You look great.

674
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,000
You're gonna
kill it, buddy.

675
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,500
What was I thinking, man?

676
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,000
No one can get
the kill screen.

677
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,600
I can't handle the math.

678
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,700
You've dedicated three years

679
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,300
of your life to playing
Missile Command.

680
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,700
It's too heavy.

681
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,500
It feels like my brain
is about to...

682
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,100
What's next for Jeff Barnes,

683
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,200
Missile Command world champ?

684
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Get up for
a second.

685
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,600
Hey.

686
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,700
I'll get some water.

687
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,700
Hey, we-we-we need
to take care of this.

688
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,700
Yeah.
Here I come.

689
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,700
Hey, hey.

690
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
Come on, buddy,
come on!

691
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,400
Wake up, buddy!
You got to play!

692
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
You got to get the kill screen,
you got to get the code.

693
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,800
If we don't stop that
satellite, they're gonna launch

694
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,600
some crazy missile into
space and then-then...

695
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,800
then it's World War III.

696
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,700
Acceptable civilian casualties.

697
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,900
Oh, my God.

698
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,400
Hey, Chuck, what's up?

699
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Hey, I was thinking,

700
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,700
why don't you guys
get out of town, maybe

701
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,800
Palm Springs, you and Awesome
just get out of town.

702
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,500
Now, actually,
would be a great time.

703
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,500
Trip's on me, you know.

704
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,800
- Early wedding present.
- Wait a minute.

705
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,300
Are you trying to get rid of me?

706
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,500
No, no, I just
thought it'd be nice.

707
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,800
What's gotten into you?

708
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,900
I don't know.

709
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,000
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

710
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,100
I- I know I've been a bit
of a disappointment lately.

711
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,400
I- I-I want you
to be proud of me.

712
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,800
I just... I ran out of time,
that's all.

713
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,300
Why don't we talk about this
when you get home?

714
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,200
I got to run.

715
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I love you, Ellie.

716
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,000
Honey,

717
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,800
do you think my brother's
on drugs?

718
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,800
That'd explain a lot.

719
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,700
They're going nuts
out there, okay?

720
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,700
These nerds are gonna
tear this joint apart.

721
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,100
You got to do
something.

722
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,900
What am I supposed to do?

723
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,100
Well, they came to see
video game greatness.

724
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,100
Someone better deliver.

725
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,700
Ladies and gentlemen...

726
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,100
or Gentlemen,

727
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,400
let me introduce you
to the challenger.

728
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,800
Hailing from the City of Angels,
the Master of Disaster...

729
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,700
What's going on?

730
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,400
...the King of Sting,

731
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,900
the Dancing Destroyer,

732
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,800
Charles Irving

733
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,800
Bartowski!

734
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,300
Who is this guy?

735
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,700
Where's
Jeff Barnes?

736
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,600
Who authorized this?

737
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,900
This is an abomination.

738
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,400
THE END

739
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,700
You suck, Bartowski.

740
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,900
<i>Are you listening to Rush?</i>

741
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,600
<i>Music of the universe.</i>

742
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,000
Missile Command.

743
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,500
The mathematical pattern
underlying the game

744
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,100
is exactly the same as-

745
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,500
Morgan.

746
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,400
Hey, uh, buddy,

747
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,600
do, do we carry any Rush CDs
in the store?

748
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,500
No need, I got 'em
all on my Zune.

749
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,900
You have a Zune?

750
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,700
Are you kidding me? No.
No, I'll grab my iPod.

751
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,800
Good, good, good,
I have, I have

752
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,700
a very,
very special request.

753
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,500
On my mark.

754
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,100
Three, two, one.

755
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200

756
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,800
* A modern-day warrior-
mean, mean stride *

757
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,200
* Today's Tom Sawyer-
mean, mean pride... *

758
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,200
* Though his mind is not
for rent *

759
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,200
* Don't put him down
as arrogant *

760
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,900
* His reserve, a quiet defense *

761
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,100
* Riding out the day's events *

762
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,100
* The river... *

763
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,000

00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Welcome to Strategic Air
Command, Major Casey.

765
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,200
* What you say
about his company *

766
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,300
* Is what you say
about society *

00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,000
* Catch the mist,
catch the myth *

768
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,700
* Catch the mystery,
catch the drift... *

769
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,500
Engaging telemetry.

770
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,900
Arming warhead.

771
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,300
And opening silo door.

772
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,000
* No, his mind is not for rent *

773
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,800
* To any God or government *

774
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,600
* Always hopeful,
yet discontent *

775
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,400
* He knows changes
aren't permanent... *

776
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,600
Give me the code.

777
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,500
It was destroyed.

778
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm gonna do this.

779
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,800
No one can stop
the satellite now!

780
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,700
Tell me what
the target is.

781
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,500
- What's the satellite aimed at? 
- Why?

782
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,500
It doesn't matter.

783
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,400
No one will remember
who threw the first stone.

784
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,400
- Oh, my God.
- Gentlemen,

785
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,900
we have a kill screen.

786
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,800
I got this.

787
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,400
Target's to range.

788
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,300
Releasing synchronized safeties.

789
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,400
On my mark.

790
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,300
<i>Three,</i>

791
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,600
two, one, mark.

792
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,000
CONGRATULATIONS, MR. MORIMOTO.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY AGAIN?
YES              NO

793
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,200
NO

794
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,300
OZPGSB

795
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,600
Fire when ready, sir.

796
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Chuck, what's happening?

797
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,500
Sarah, I did it!

798
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,100
I did it, I beat the game.

799
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,000
I got to the kill screen.

800
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,100
I got the code!

801
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,600
The game- it follows a pattern.

802
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,900
It's just like
Mr. Morimoto said-

803
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,700
the music of the universe.

804
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,000
Chuck, just give me the code.

805
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,600
Oscar...

806
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,600

00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,400

Bob...

811
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,000
WEAPONS SEQUENCE TERMINATED 

812
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,900
Oh, my God.

813
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Satellite's powering down.

814
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,300
Terminate launch sequence.

815
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,500
This bogey's
bugging out

816
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,600
and going home.

817
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,000
Damn.

818
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,500
You did it, Chuck.

819
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,400
It worked!

820
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,100
How does it feel to be a hero,

821
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,600
Mr. Bartowski?

822
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,700
Oh. Oh.

823
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,300
<i>Looks like you fools had
one hell of a party.</i>

824
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,400
Congratulations,
Bartowski.

825
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,300
That's quite
an achievement.

826
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,900
And in light
of today's events,

827
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,800
I'd like to announce

828
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,200
there's a new assistant
manager amongst us.

829
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,800
What'd I tell you, man?

830
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,100
It's all coming up
Bartowski.

831
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,800
You all remember
Mr. Emmett Milbarge.

832
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,600
Mr. Milbarge has
volunteered to stay on

833
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,500
for...

834
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,800
well, as long as it takes.

835
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,300
That's right, Michael.

836
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,300
I'm afraid this
branch is sick.

837
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,100
And not the kind of sick that
can be fixed with a Band-Aid.

838
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,900
What this Buy More needs
requires a surgeon.

839
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,900
Someone who doesn't mind

840
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,700
getting up to their
elbows in guts.

841
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,000
Mmm.

842
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,100
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

843
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,800
I'm gonna reach in,

844
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,000
wrap my fingers
around the disease,

845
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,100
and rip... it... out.

846
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,700
How you feeling, buddy?

847
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,500
- Better.
- Good.

848
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,500
Thanks.

849
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,300
So...

850
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,500
Missile Command champion.

851
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,100
I got lucky.

852
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,300
You know.

853
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,200
Congrats.

854
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
I'm glad it was you.

855
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,400
I mean, you're sure
you're not...

856
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,000
Me? Uh-uh.

857
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm cool.

858
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Being number one
is a real bitch.

859
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,300
Feels like the whole world is
gunning for you, sometimes.

860
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
I can imagine.

861
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,500
So, what was it like?

862
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
The kill screen?

863
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,900
Forget it.

864
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,900
I'll see you tomorrow.

865
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,700
Oh,

866
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,900
I am so proud of you!

867
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,100
Hey, relax.

868
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,200
It's just a video game.

869
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,600
Granted, I am the best Missile
Commander in the world.

870
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
I'm not talking
about a stupid video game.

871
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,900
I'm talking about this.

872
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,600
Sarah told us
what's inside.

873
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
My diploma?

874
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,200
Well, don't act
so surprised.

875
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,000
You sly dog.

876
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,300
Sarah also told us about

877
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,100
what you've been doing
behind our backs.

878
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,200
She did?

879
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,000
Really?

880
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,700
Yeah. No wonder you've
been such a mess

881
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,200
- this past year.
- Why didn't you

882
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,100
tell us that you were
taking online courses?

883
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,800
Oh!

884
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,700
Oh, right... that.

885
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,500
You two kids have some
celebrating to do.

886
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
She's waiting
out back.

887
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,900
You'll thank me for that ginseng
shake in the morning.

888
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,800
You really surprised me,
Charles.

889
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,700
Well, thanks for
my fake diploma.

890
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,800
- What do you mean?
- I get it.

891
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,400
You know, you had one
of your CIA pal's

892
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,300
doctor it up to get
Ellie off my back.

893
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,500
It's real, Chuck.

894
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,300
Come on.

895
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,800
I'm serious.
You graduated.

896
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,200
What about my last
12 credits?

897
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,300
Well, Casey and I decided

898
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,300
that your exceptional
field service

899
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,600
ought to count
for something

900
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,300
and Stanford agreed.

901
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,000
Huh.

902
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,000
And by exceptional,
you mean, like, uh,

903
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,000
I don't know, decrypting
weapons-satellite codes?

904
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,100
Electrical Engineering.

905
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,600
Or running away from
exploding games

906
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,800
of Missile Command?

907
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,200
Physical Education.

908
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,400
You earned it, Chuck.

909
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,800
Thank you.

910
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,200
You see that star out there
on the horizon?

911
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,400
That's the Air Force

912
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,800
bouncing Morimoto's satellite
off the atmosphere

913
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,900
and burning it up.

914
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Make a wish.

915
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,900
It's yours.

916
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,500
Hey, bud.

917
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,200
Let's party.

918
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,600
