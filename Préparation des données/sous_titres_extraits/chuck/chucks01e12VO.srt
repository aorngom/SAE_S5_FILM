1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,300
i'm glad you like it.

2
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,900
i love it.

3
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,700
what time is it?

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,600
Are you insane? Come back to bed.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,000
And miss all the good sunlight?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Come on, Ilsa,
it's not like

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,100
the civil war is going
to go anywhere.

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,300
Tempting.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,200
But I have a deadline.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,100
Yeah...

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,500
Why did I ever let myself
get involved

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,600
with a photo-journalist?

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,100
And how did I get
myself mixed up with a--

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,300
what do you call yourself again?

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,700
An energy consultant.

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,800
What does that even mean?

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,900
It means I get to sleep in late.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,600
Here's my offer,
Yeah?

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,200
- Mr. Energy Consultant.
- Mm-hmm.

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,200
You stay in bed and preserve
your precious energy.

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,500
And I'll be back
before you know it.

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,300
Bye-bye, Sugar Bear.

23
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,900
 <i>Did you hear a word I said?</i>

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,100
 <i>Hello?</i>

25
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,600
Do you speak English?

26
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,100
 <i>Parla usted Inglese?</i>
Hello?

27
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,700
Yeah.

28
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,900
Then why aren't you moving?

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,600
Because if you
were listening,

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,100
then you'd be walking to the register
to get me my 300 bucks!

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Sir, I repeat:

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,100
I cannot offer you a refund
without a valid receipt.

33
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,500
You can't give
me a refund,

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,100
you won't give
me an exchange.

35
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,000
What exactly are you capable of doing,

36
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,200
Big Johnny?

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,800
You sad, impotent oaf?

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,700
I'm capable of stopping your heart...

39
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,100
Hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa,

40
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,000
hey john, ??? problem here.

41
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,100
- Let me guess, it's the auto-focus, right?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,100
Happens all the time.
It's a quick...

43
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,000
quick, quick fix, and I can
take care of it personally.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,200
If you'll just leave
your name and number

45
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,100
at the Nerd Herd desk,

46
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,800
I'll take care of it
in a jiff, okay?

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,400
- Was that so hard?
- Thank you. Have a good day.

48
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,900
Just breathe, Casey, breathe.

49
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,800
Breathe... or growl.

50
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,900
Growling also works.
Very good.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Very, very good.

52
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,600
Hey.

53
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,400
You're not going
to believe it.

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Oh, you got that
server to work?

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,300
I got Tara Reid's phone number.

56
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
What have I told you about
stalking "celebrities" online?

57
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,400
And, by the way, who doesn't
have her phone number?

58
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,700
Is that the Grand
Saville's main database?

59
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,900
I can access every guest staying
at L.A.'s swankiest hotel.

60
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,200
It's got it all:
room numbers, credit cards,

61
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,400
spank-per-view records...

62
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,800
That's super, Jeff.
Really good work.

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,700
I'll let the hotel know
that their computer's ready.

64
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,900
You're giving away
the holy grail! Tara!

65
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,400
Grand Saville,
please don't sue us.

66
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,800
Dmitry Siljak--

67
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,800
known alias
of black market arms dealer

68
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,700
specializing in former Soviet...

69
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,800
Okay. Man, I'm going to have
a headache tomorrow.

70
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,800
Ilsa Trinchina.

71
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,400
AP photographer, rumored lover
of undercover NSA agent.

72
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,900
Whereabouts unknown.

73
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,400
Sugar Bear?

74
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,300
Sugar Bear's
girlfriend's in town.

75
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,200
Casey, hey, hey, hey!

76
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,900
Wait up! wait up!

77
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,700
I just had the mother lode
of all bad guy flashes.

78
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,900
- Who are they?
- Mostly Russian.

79
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,400
All traveling under aliases,
fake passports.

80
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,800
That means they're
arms dealers,

81
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,100
- money launderers, black market smugglers...
- Yeah.

82
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,600
Apparently, they're all
having a douche bag

83
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,100
convention down
at the Grand Saville.

84
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,200
I'll run it up the flagpole,

85
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,400
see what command wants us to do.

86
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,500
Uh... one more thing.

87
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,100
There was another name,

88
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,100
one name that I flashed on
actually,

89
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,400
but I left it--

90
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,300
her-- off of the list.

91
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,900
What the hell are you talking
about, Bartowski?

92
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,300
Does the name Ilsa Trinchina

93
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,800
mean anything to you...

94
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,600
Sugar Bear?

95
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,900
You say that
name ever again

96
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,200
and I will end you.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,200
Nod if you understand.

98
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,000
Casey... you're hurting
the Intersect.

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,400
Hey.

103
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,100
Try this. It's the new

104
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,800
breakfast corndog
with country sausage

105
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,300
and syrup wrapped
in pancake.

106
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,700
Thank you, but maybe
a little bit later.

107
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,200
I have some serious
business to discuss--

108
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,700
matter of national security.

109
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,500
Casey's ex-girlfriend
is in town.

110
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,200
What? How do you know?

111
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,800
I flashed.

112
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,300
Her name is Ilsa Trinchina.

113
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,900
Super-hot,
super-sexy and staying

114
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,700
at the Grand Saville
as we speak.

115
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,100
- Does Casey know?
- Oh, yeah. Almost ripped

116
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,900
my head off; it must've been
a pretty bad break-up.

117
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,400
You know for the longest
time, I always imagined

118
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,300
Casey was built like a Ken doll,
you know, downstairs.

119
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,000
I don't know what kind of woman

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,900
would go for a guy like Casey.

121
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,700
I was, uh, I was kind of hoping
you'd help me find out.

122
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,600
Ilsa is a civilian.

123
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
She's a foreign national.

124
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,900
The Intersect has,
like, nothing on her

125
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,600
except for some love letters
that now I'll never

126
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,800
be able
to scrub out of my brain.

127
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,100
You want me to go
behind Casey's back,

128
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
reallocate CIA resources

129
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,200
and violate this
woman's privacy,

130
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,300
so you can find out
what their story is?

131
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,100
Tell me you're not curious.

132
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,700
- Hi.
- Hi.

133
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm Ellie Bartowski.
Chuck's sister.

134
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,100
Oh, yes, of course.

135
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,400
I recognize
Chuck's sensual mouth.

136
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,500
Devon.

137
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,400
- Lester.
- Jeff.

138
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,200
Well, any coworker
of Chuck's is

139
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,800
a guy who can help me
pick some stuff out to buy.

140
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,700
Jeff, Lester, uh...

141
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,300
Why don't you give my guests
a little breathing room?

142
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,800
We have business to discuss.

143
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,600
So?

144
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,500
What can I help you
with today, ma'am?

145
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,900
Well, this year
for our anniversary,

146
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,000
Devon and I are making
a little bit more money...

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So we decided to buy

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,100
one large gift instead
of two smaller ones.

149
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,700
Awesome, right?

150
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,000
Ooh, gives me a chill
when you say it, babe.

151
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,000
Have we settled
on what that item may be?

152
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

153
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Beautiful, isn't she?

154
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,000
Beautiful, isn't she?

155
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,300
Think of all the great
things we can watch.

156
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,400
Think of all the great
things we can wash.

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I want you guys to know
that I'm not just a salesman.

158
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,500
I've come to think of myself
as a retail therapist.

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,200
Ellie, why do you really
want the television?

160
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,000
So that we can spend
more time together.

161
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,700
Quiet evenings at home,

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,300
cuddling on the couch.

163
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,200
That's good.

164
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,700
Good. Devon...

165
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,400
What is really behind
the washer and dryer?

166
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,800
So we can spend
more time together.

167
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,400
- What?
- No more Laundromats.

168
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,500
We come home from a ride
and go onto a run

169
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,000
without worrying
about dirty shorts.

170
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I never go running with you.

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,800
Well, maybe you would
with a drawer full

172
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,300
of clean jog bras, babe.

173
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh, sorry. Hold on.

174
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700
That's the hospital.
I have to go.

175
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,600
What am I supposed to do
about our anniversary gift?

176
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,200
You know what, honey? Why don't
you just surprise me, okay?

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,700
Love you.

178
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,300
We received your report, Major.

179
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,600
Ex-KGB, Eastern Bloc thugs,

180
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,300
Russian arms dealers...

181
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,300
Frankly, we're not
used to seeing

182
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,900
this particular crowd
stateside these days.

183
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,000
Least not since President Reagan
won The Cold War, huh, General?

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,500
So you want us to infiltrate
the Grand Saville?

185
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,700
The hotel's bar has been booked
for a private party

186
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,600
early this evening.

187
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
Fine, I'll clear my schedule,

188
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,600
but just 'cause it's you,
General.

189
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Mr. Bartowski,
it's up to you to tell us

190
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,700
what these criminal agents
are all doing in Los Angeles.

191
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,000
You and Agent Walker
are going undercover.

192
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,200
We need you to press
some Russian flesh,

193
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,700
see what you can flash on.

194
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,000
And, uh... good luck.

195
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,100
So, what about you, Casey?

196
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
- What about me?
- I don't know.

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,400
I just thought
if Sarah and I have to go

198
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
to the hotel to press
some Russian flesh,

199
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,500
you might want to drop
in on a certain

200
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,100
somebody whose name
I will not...

201
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,600
- Chuck...
- Okay, fine.

202
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,500
I'll shut up
now. Geez, what?

203
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
What is with that guy?

204
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,700
He really doesn't want
to see his ex, does he?

205
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,800
I doubt it.

206
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
Ilsa's dead.

207
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,700
 <i>I don't get it.</i>

208
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,100
If Casey's
girlfriend is dead,

209
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,000
who's the Ilsa Trinchina
staying in this hotel?

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,700
Probably someone traveling
on a fake passport.

211
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,200
It happens all
the time in Russia.

212
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
People die and their
personal info gets recycled.

213
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,000
My God, that's
so horrible.

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,800
No wonder Casey's so messed up.

215
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,800
casey, Oh, hey...

216
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,500
Hey, I just-- you know what,

217
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,300
I'm sorry about
what I said earlier.

218
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,600
Drop it, Chuck.
You heard the General.

219
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,900
We've got work to do.

220
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,000
Those are our Russians.

221
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
Wait, wait, wait--
this isn't a black tie thing.

222
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm way overdressed.

223
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,200
Yeah, lose the jacket.

224
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,600
What's this?

225
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, perfect.

226
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,100
You know, it would
have been nice to know

227
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,000
that I was the help
on this mission.

228
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,600
I could have done
some character study.

229
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,900
Recognize
anyone, Chuck?

230
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,200
That's, uh, Dmitry Siljak.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,300
Black market arms dealer.

232
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,600
Sergey "Noodles" Romanov.

233
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,000
Freelance hit man.

234
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,800
Sacha!

235
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,900
Is that you,
my sweet Sacha?

236
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,100
Everybody, meet

237
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,400
fourth cousin
on my mother's side.

238
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,300
Sacha, come and give
your cousin great big hug!

239
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,000
Ow! Ow! Ow!

240
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,100
Hey.

241
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Sacha!

242
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
 <i>Da. Da. Da.</i>

243
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,400
Russian. Sacha.

244
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,900
Sacha wants to dance!

245
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,900
No. No, dance, no.
 <i>Nyet, nyet, nyet, nyet.</i>

246
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,800
No.

247
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,800
How much for
the whole night?

248
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,700
Don't touch me again, pig.

249
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,400
Get low! Get low!

250
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,900
We are great dancers,
aren't we, us Russians?

251
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,700
Like-Like Baryshnikov!

252
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,200
 <i>White Nights?</i> Anybody
seen <i>White Nights?</i>

253
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,800
- You like what I was doing?
You like what I was doing?
- Yes. Yes.

254
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,200
We're in
a circle.

255
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,500
Hold hands.

256
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,100
Sacha, you like blonde?

257
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,000
Come here!

258
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Very nice!

259
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,000
She is all
yours, Sacha!

260
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh!

261
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,900
She's here.
Ilsa is here.

262
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,500
What? Are you sure?

263
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,300
Look over there.

264
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,600
Our cover has
been compromised.

265
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,700
- Request team extraction.
- I'm on it.

266
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Ilsa?

267
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,800
Oh, my God.

268
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,400
How are you alive?

269
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,600
No one could have
survived that blast. How did you...?

270
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,500
I'm so sorry.

271
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,100
Why are you sorry?

272
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,500
All I remember is,

273
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,900
I woke up in a hospital
in Grozny

274
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,800
two weeks after the blast.

275
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,900
I couldn't see,
I couldn't hear.

276
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,200
It took another two months
for me to remember my name.

277
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,900
But I never forgot your face.

278
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,500
We're Russian!

279
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,500
Oh. Motherland!

280
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Come with me.

281
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,900
Keep on coming.

282
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,300
You crazy people.

283
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,900
We've got to get
him out of here.

284
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,500
Oh, come on. The guy spent
four years of his life

285
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,700
thinking he'd never
see her again.

286
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,100
His cover has been compromised.

287
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,400
Can't the man live
without a cover

288
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,600
for just a couple of minutes?

289
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,000
Hello, everybody.

290
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,000
How are we doing tonight, huh?

291
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,700
Sarah? Sarah,

292
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,800
I think I know what brought
all the baddies together.

293
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,200
Him.

294
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,600
Victor Federov.

295
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,100
A Russian
oligarch with ties

296
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,300
to everything from the mob

297
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,400
to a plot
to overthrow Parliament.

298
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,600
What brings you to Los Angeles?
Why-Why are you here?

299
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Please, I'd like
to introduce you

300
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,200
to a woman who will make me
the happiest man on earth

301
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,400
by becoming my wife.

302
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,100
Ilsa Trinchina!

303
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,900
Hey, buddy.

304
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
How are you feeling?

305
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,100
How am I feeling?

306
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,900
Yeah, uh, you know,

307
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,000
about last night?

308
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,900
Our mission
was a success.

309
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,000
You I.D.'d Victor
Federov.

310
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Agent Walker's
been assigned

311
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,700
to set up a surveillance
on the target.

312
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,700
In short, I feel
fan-eff'in-tastic.

313
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,400
Well... okay. I-I
mean, I guess, uh,

314
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,700
you know, I was
referring more

315
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,100
to the you and Ilsa
situation.

316
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,300
Thought maybe you'd want
to talk about the fact

317
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,700
that the girl you thought
was dead isn't actually dead.

318
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,400
No.

319
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,400
Great. Good, good.

320
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,400
Really good session here, Casey.

321
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,900
Really feel like
you're making a breakthrough.

322
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,300
Look, I just...
I just want you to know

323
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,700
that I'm a good
listener, okay?

324
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,600
So, if you ever want
to talk about anything.

325
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,000
If you want to use me

326
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,700
as a sounding board
for your emotions, or...

327
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,800
Finding everything okay?

328
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,500
Come on, buddy.

329
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,300
Just give me
something, anything.

330
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Where is she from?

331
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,700
Or where did you two meet?

332
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,200
Why is this so important
to you, Chuck?

333
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,200
Why the hell do you care
so much about me and Ilsa?

334
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,400
I don't... I don't
know, man, okay?

335
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,900
I just... I-I think it
would be nice to know

336
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,600
that you had a life before...

337
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,300
this.

338
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
I just figured, if a guy
like you can find love--

339
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,600
no offense, Casey--

340
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,600
then maybe there's
hope for me, too.

341
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,800
Maybe this whole
spy business

342
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,700
isn't as screwed up
as I think it is.

343
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,400
Hmm.

344
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,300
Hmm? That's-That's...
Okay, you know what?

345
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,500
If you want to
go through life

346
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,100
all emotionally-constipated
and alone,

347
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,000
then suit yourself.

348
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,800
I'll let you get back to
protecting the greater good,

349
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,400
you freakin' robot.

350
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,500
I met her
in a flower market.

351
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
In Rome.

352
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,400
Ilsa was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen.

353
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,300
I knew it.

354
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,200
It's alive!

355
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,800
Yeah! There she
is. There she is.

356
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,600
Hey, you think
Ellie's going

357
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,700
to be cool that you went
with the washer and dryer?

358
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,900
Ah, no worries.

359
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,700
Oh, hey, Babe.

360
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,000
Happy
Anniversary!

361
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,700
You got the washer and dryer.

362
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,200
Well, you told me
to surprise you.

363
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,700
So, surprise!

364
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,500
You getting what you want
isn't a surprise.

365
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
What's that supposed to mean?

366
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,900
It means that I would like
to go to brunch,

367
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,700
but you would rather
go rock climbing.

368
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,700
Or I want to go wine
tasting in Napa, but
you would rather

369
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,400
go to Baja and go kite surfing.

370
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,100
It's always about
what you want.

371
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,100
Come on, Babe.

372
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,600
It's just a washer
and dryer.

373
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,700
It's not just a washer
and dryer.

374
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,100
It's about what it represents.

375
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,700
It represents clean clothes.

376
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,500
Have you guys
ever considered...?

377
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,000
- What?
- What?

378
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,300
Well, that maybe,

379
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,500
on an unconscious level,

380
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,300
Devon, uh, has the need
to exercise

381
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,400
or go on these extreme
adventures because,

382
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,800
well, maybe
he's scared of intimacy,

383
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,400
of being tied down.

384
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,700
- Yes! Exactly!
- No!

385
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,100
Ellie, how does that
make you feel?

386
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,300
Like I'm banking on my future
with a giant, muscley child.

387
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,200
And I can't do it anymore.

388
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,000
And, Devon, you--
how do you feel?

389
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,800
Of course, naturally. Sure.

390
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,100
Sure, it was great.

391
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,000
You know, we had what
we had, but it's over.

392
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,100
So, that-that's it?

393
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,300
You're just going to let her
walk back out of your life?

394
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,100
Seems like
the smart play, Chuck.

395
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,200
Nice girls don't marry
corrupt Russian oligarchs.

396
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Well, I hate to
break it to you,

397
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,900
but nice girls don't
go around marrying guys

398
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,100
like you, either.

399
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
G-man assassin?
International spy?

400
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,600
I mean, pardon me for
saying it, Casey, but
at least on paper,

401
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,500
you're kind of
an unsavory dude.

402
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,000
Granted.

403
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,400
But Ilsa never knew
what I do for a living.

404
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,000
That's exactly my point.

405
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,900
What if Ilsa doesn't know

406
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,500
what her fiancé Victor does
for a living,

407
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
either?

408
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,900
What are you saying I do?

409
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,200
Stick to your
strengths, buddy.

410
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,600
Come on. You're a fighter.

411
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,100
You got to fight for her.

412
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,200
<i>This is a terrible idea, Chuck.</i>

413
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,100
We shouldn't be here.

414
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,200
- Can we just go...?
- Negatory.

415
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,900
We have passed the
point of no return.

416
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,800
- No retreat, soldier.
- This isn't a mission.

417
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,200
We're just two guys
sneaking down a hall

418
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,700
like a couple
of numb nuts.

419
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,400
- Hey.
- What are you two doing here?

420
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,100
I'd like to apologize,
Agent Walker.

421
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,500
Uh, Chuck here convinced me...

422
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,800
To come... to come down to
the hotel, and to bring me,

423
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,300
because I... maybe I
could flash on some stuff.

424
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,800
Some cool stuff or
things or whatever.

425
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,600
You volunteered
to go on an all-night stakeout?

426
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,800
Doesn't sound like me, does it?

427
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,500
I know. But I couldn't sleep.

428
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,800
So I thought
it would do me some good

429
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,200
to-to... to, uh, you know,

430
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,600
look at some surveillance
monitors or something.

431
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,000
Maybe... 
... knock me right out.

432
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,900
So...

433
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,100
This way.

434
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,600
I've already tapped
into the hotel security feed.

435
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,500
You two get comfy.

436
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,100
I'm going to deliver
the surveillance

437
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,800
- to the bridal suite.
- Good bug.

438
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,400
With any luck, we'll get
enough dirt off the wire

439
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,300
to take the target down
on U.S. soil.

440
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,200
Hmm.

441
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,300
Have fun.

442
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,600
Don't wait up. Just going
to be looking at, uh...

443
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,800
...monitors and...

444
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,700
Um, Casey?

445
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,000
What, did you flash?

446
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,300
Look who's hitting the bar
the night before

447
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,400
her own wedding.

448
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,400
Now, does that look
like the face

449
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,100
of a woman who's happy
about getting married?

450
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,900
Where's she going?

451
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,100
Look, look, look, look.

452
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
This is your chance, buddy!

453
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,800
This is your chance!
Look at her, Casey.

454
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,400
She's just sitting there
waiting for you.

455
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,100
Wait a second.

456
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,800
You're scared,
aren't you?

457
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,100
Don't be an idiot.

458
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,400
Kemo sabe.
Come on, man, look,

459
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,500
you don't want to
spend the rest

460
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,200
of your life
hating yourself

461
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,600
for what you didn't have
the guts to say tonight.

462
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,900
Okay? Believe me.

463
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,200
I know.

464
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,800
Hey,

465
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,200
this is a private floor.

466
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,700
Ooh.

467
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,500
Casey, you're going to have
to deliver the package.

468
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,900
I've got a body to take care of.

469
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,200
Keys are in the sugar.

470
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,100
Deliver the package?

471
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,000
Casey, do you read me?

472
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,300
Uh...

473
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,600
Yeah, uh, copy that.

474
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,700
On my way.

475
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,600
Bonsoir.

476
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,000
Housekeeping.

477
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,100
Okay. Eenie, meenie,

478
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,600
miney...

479
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,800
moe.

480
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Oh...

481
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,900
These stupid
keys never work.

482
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,400
Come here.

483
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,700
Oh, Casey.

484
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Oh, Ilsa.

485
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
I've missed you.

486
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,300
- I missed you.
- i missed you, too.

487
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Bartowski.

488
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,600
What the hell
are you doing here?

489
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,900
Listen, I-I'm, I'm really sorry.

490
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,100
I know this is very awkward,
but Ilsa is a bad girl.

491
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,700
She's a very bad girl.

492
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,200
Drop the gun, Sugar Bear.

493
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,500
See?

494
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,900
Mind telling me
what a nice girl like you

495
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,000
is doing with a gun, Ilsa?

496
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,500
Same thing as
you, Casey.

497
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,400
I tried to warn you;
she's a spy.

498
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,500
Who do you work for?

499
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,600
Why don't you ask your friend?
He's already seen my files.

500
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,500
Uh... yeah, I did.

501
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,700
She's French
Secret Service.

502
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,800
But, but, but wouldn't that
put us all on the same side,

503
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,900
kind of, sort of,
doesn't it?

504
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,200
- You lied to me.
- Says the energy consultant.

505
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,100
What about the bomb
in Grozny?

506
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,100
That "I never forgot
your face" garbage?

507
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,600
Oh, that bomb.

508
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,400
- Ilsa.
- Quick, hide.

509
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,200
You have to trust me.

510
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,300
Ilsa.

511
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,400
Ilsa.

512
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,700
Baby.

513
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,800
Where have you been hiding,
Ilsa?

514
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,300
I can't wait any longer.

515
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,700
How about we start
our honeymoon <i>now?</i>

516
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,900
Oh, Victor.

517
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,700
Don't even think about it;
you don't know who's on top.

518
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You guys, get out of here
before he wakes up.

519
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,800
All right...
here you go.

520
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,400
Michael,
in or out?

521
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,500
Hey, thanks for letting me join
your game, boys.

522
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,700
Perfect distraction.

523
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,800
Captain here had a fight
with his lady friend.

524
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,600
Oh... the doghouse.

525
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,000
Been there many a time,
my friend.

526
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,700
- No, you haven't.
- Guys,

527
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,100
Ellie and I are just going
through a little rough patch.

528
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,100
- Both trying to figure...
-Let me share

529
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,300
- one thing that I know from personal experience.
- No, you don't.

530
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,200
You do not need some broad
holding your maracas

531
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,500
in a vise.

532
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,500
Yeah,
man-cake like you,

533
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,600
you should install a turnstile
on your bedroom door.

534
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,300
Yeah.

535
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,800
- Huh.
- So...

536
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,900
in or out?

537
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,500
All right...
I have absolutely nada.

538
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,600
- Pair of threes.
- I missed my straight.

539
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,900
- Busted flush.
- Trip nines, gentlemen.

540
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,000
- Big man.
- Daddy takes it home.

541
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Fine, all right,
rules is rules.

542
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,800
This is what's great
about boys' night.

543
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,900
Hey, man-cake,
what do you think?

544
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,500
Want to do this again
tomorrow, single guy?

545
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,900
I got a surgery I got to do.

546
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,500
Dude, we
want to take

547
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,800
your pants off.

548
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,400
Oh, we got to get
that guy's pants off.

549
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,800
And then?

550
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,400
It wasn't long after
we were married

551
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,800
that Victor went back
to Czechoslovakia.

552
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,000
Hey, Casey,

553
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,600
we need to talk.

554
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,100
- Is it related to last night?
- Uh...

555
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,500
- well, yeah.
- Then I don't want

556
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,200
to talk about it.

557
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
- Listen, Casey.
- No, you listen.

558
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,400
Whatever you
thought existed

559
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,600
between me and Ilsa, you
were wrong, all right?

560
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,500
That person has gone
back to being dead to me.

561
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,100
You have something
to say, Chuck?

562
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,600
Yeah, just that there's a
dead lady waiting to see you.

563
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,700
How did you find me, Ilsa?

564
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,600
Your friend left
this under the bed.

565
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,800
He's not much
of a spy.

566
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
So what do you want?

567
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,000
I didn't want
to leave things

568
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,400
the way we left
them last night.

569
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,100
With you getting plowed
by a drunk Russian crime boss?

570
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,400
You should get used
to that.

571
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,000
We've been investigating
Victor Federov

572
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,900
since the Paris commuter
train bombings back in '02.

573
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,200
My agency has tried everything
to take him to trial,

574
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,200
but his organization
is airtight,

575
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,100
totally legit
from the outside.

576
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,900
The only way we could
take him down was...

577
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,800
By screwing it out of him?
How, uh...

578
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,200
French.

579
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
If you are French.

580
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,000
- Casey, please...
- I make one call

581
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,500
and you, Victor,
and half the Grand Saville

582
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,700
are packed on a plane,

583
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,300
shipped off to the nearest
detention center of my choice.

584
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
You're not going
to do that.

585
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,100
Really?
Why is that?

586
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,800
That would be
unprofessional.

587
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,600
And that's not you.

588
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,600
I wish things
could be different.

589
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,600
I'm sorry, Casey.

590
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,800
Good-bye.

591
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,600
A lot of Scotch
and a little Neil.

592
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,600
Everything
okay, buddy?

593
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,900
Just enjoying myself
a little R & R.

594
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Mm-hmm.

595
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,200
- Want a drink?
- No, no.

596
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,700
Thanks, though,
I really appreciate it.

597
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,300
No, just, uh, just thought
I'd check in on you, you know,

598
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,600
what with Ilsa getting married
in an hour and...

599
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,000
Thanks for reminding me.

600
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,500
Here's to John Casey
dodging another bullet.

601
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,700
It's not
like I want the wife and kids

602
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,200
and the Little League practice
and the minivan

603
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,800
and the Costco runs
on the weekend.

604
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,300
Yeah, really, you don't?

605
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,700
'Cause I-- it, it seems to me

606
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,100
that you'd kind of be
into the whole American Dream.

607
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,100
Nah.

608
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,900
I do what I do...

609
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,400
so all those other slobs
out there can have it.

610
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,200
What, uh, what would you say
your dream is?

611
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,000
You're looking at it.

612
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,900
- Sarah.
- Hi.

613
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,600
Hi, I'm so glad you're here.

614
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,300
Uh, yeah,

615
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,500
- me, too.
- Uh, I'm having

616
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,800
a little... a little wine.

617
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,000
- You want some?
- Uh...

618
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,700
I'm actually fine,
but you go ahead.

619
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,700
Okay.

620
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,000
Um, is Chuck here?

621
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,500
Uh-uh.

622
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,400
No, it's, um, it's just,
just me tonight,

623
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,800
um, all, all by myself.

624
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,100
Oh.

625
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,300
Um, are you okay?

626
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,400
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

627
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,800
Okay.

628
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,200
Ellie, are you
sure you're okay?

629
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,100
It's just that...
I have both feet in

630
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,000
and Devon
only has one foot in,

631
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,900
so then it's just me
taking care of three feet

632
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,400
and I want it
to be us,

633
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,700
you know,
taking care of four feet.

634
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,000
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

635
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Completely.

636
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,200
Of course you do.

637
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
- I'm going to go get us
some more wine.
- Okay.

638
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Besides, Chuck,

639
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,100
it's not like Ilsa left me
empty-handed.

640
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,400
- What's that?
- Mm...

641
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,000
just a cheap little trinket
I used to think meant something.

642
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,300
You mind telling
me what that is?

643
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,500
It's an RX-77 long-range
audio transmitter.

644
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,900
Someone was listening in
on Ilsa?

645
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,700
- With a Russian-made bug.
- That means

646
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,900
they heard last night.

647
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,500
That means
Victor knows she's a spy.

648
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,600
Whoa, uh, hey, Ca-Casey,
Casey, Casey, Casey.

649
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,300
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
where are you going?

650
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,200
- To stop a wedding, Chuck.
- No, no, no.

651
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
No, you're not, no, you're not.

652
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,900
Scotch and driving--
very, very bad combo

653
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,400
and as far as I know,
also illegal.

654
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,800
You're absolutely right.

655
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,300
you're driving.

656
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,700
I need pants.

657
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,200
Ho, hi, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

658
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,100
What's going on, Chuck?

659
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,800
Hey, Victor planted a bug
on Ilsa.

660
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,100
He knows she's a spy.

661
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
She's walking into a trap.

662
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,800
this way.

663
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,600
Okay, uh, I'll see you soon.

664
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,700
Uh, Ellie,
I hate to do this to you.

665
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,400
No, no, no, no, no.
No, we were just going to...

666
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,400
we were going
to talk about Chuck

667
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,800
and where you see that going...

668
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,300
You know, we're going
to talk about this

669
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,700
as soon as I get back.

670
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,000
Devon?

671
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,200
Oh, I was just
looking for...

672
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,400
Oh, hey, what's going
on here, ladies?

673
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,100
Having ourselves
a little cocktail?

674
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,400
Sarah, please...
please don't leave tonight.

675
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,000
I just really can't be alone
right now.

676
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,600
- Please.
- Uh... Morgan?

677
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,000
Ellie's feeling a
little, uh... upset.

678
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,400
So, if you could just...

679
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Absolutely. Got it.
I'm your man.

680
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,200
Okay.

681
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,100
Ellie, I'll talk
to you soon.

682
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,300
Hey, hey, easy, easy, El.

683
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,900
Ole Morgan's here now.

684
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,700
I'm not gonna leave
your side, I promise.

685
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,000
You've always been
really sweet to me.

686
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,900
Ah... come on.

687
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,700
I thought we issued a "no
touch" policy back in '98.

688
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,900
Hmm? Remember that?

689
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,500
Buddy?

690
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,000
This is not how I imagined it
over and over, but...

691
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,000
let's get you to bed, huh?

692
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,200
Come on.

693
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Come on, there.

694
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Come on, old girl.

695
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,800
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

696
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,600
Where did you
get that?

697
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,400
Shh.

698
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,500
Ilsa. Ilsa...

699
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,200
I assume you're
with the bride's party?

700
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,700
Ow! Ow, that's tight.

701
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,500
You make
for a handsome groom.

702
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,200
It's a shame
to ruin the suit.

703
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,500
Ruin it how, exactly?
How would you ruin it?

704
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,000
With bullet holes
or blood or...?

705
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,400
Shut up, Chuck.
Shutting up.

706
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,800
Where's Ilsa?

707
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,000
Waiting at the ceremony.

708
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,400
Quite a woman, huh?

709
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
I'm going to miss her.

710
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,100
Oh, well.

711
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,900
At least we get to enjoy
wedding night, huh?

712
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,900
Leave her out of this.

713
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,600
I have another proposal.

714
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,000
I was so moved by listening
to you and Ilsa say good-bye,

715
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,800
what if I told you
you get to keep the girl?

716
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,100
Casey, you want to tell
me what's going on?

717
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,400
In fact, how would you and Ilsa
like to go on my honeymoon?

718
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
I love that idea.
I don't even have to go.

719
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,800
You mean let me die
in your place?

720
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,000
What'd you have in mind, Victor,
a plane crash

721
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,400
over the Pacific, a fiery wreck
that leaves nothing behind

722
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,300
but our two charred corpses?

723
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,300
Three corpses.

724
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,800
Your friend will play
the role of pilot,

725
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,900
or maybe one of those
man-stewardesses?

726
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,100
If you'll excuse me,

727
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,100
my associates have come
to see me married.

728
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,800
I would hate
to disappoint them.

729
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,800
You guys...

730
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,000
Casey, I don't want to die
as a man-stewardess.

731
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,900
Relax.

732
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,300
I think I see a scenario
where we both get out of here

733
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,800
with acceptable losses.

734
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,800
What exactly is your version
of acceptable?

735
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,900
Breaks and punctures,
possible loss of a limb,

736
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,300
no major organ damage.

737
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,700
Hey, Comrades.

738
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,000
Mind if I ask you two fellas
a question?

739
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,400
Where did you learn
to tie people up,

740
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,200
a <i>Rocky and Bullwinkle</i> cartoon?

741
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,500
I don't think that you're
helping right now.

742
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,600
Hello?

743
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
No wonder you lost the Cold War.

744
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,000
A couple of Girl Scouts could
tie people up better than this.

745
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,200
Casey, what are you...?

746
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,900
Whoa!

747
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,200
Like you said, Chuck,
I'm sticking to my strengths.

748
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,800
How many times do we have
to go through this?

749
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,400
Where's Chuck Bartowski?

750
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,100
That had to hurt.

751
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,100
Baddie at six o'clock.

752
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,300
Oh! How you like me now, sucka?

753
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,500
Ooh, Cas... Casey?
Casey! Casey!

754
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,600
High... very...
it's so very high!

755
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,100
Get 'em! Get 'em!

756
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,800
Oh! Casey!

757
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,100
I can't hold us.

758
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,100
I have very weak thighs.

759
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:56,900
Casey!

760
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,100
Last chance.

761
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,500
Where's Chuck Bartowski?

762
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,300
Hope I'm not too late
to object to this union.

763
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,200
Take these two to my plane

764
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,400
and strangle them.

765
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,700
They're not going anywhere.

766
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,700
Really?

767
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,200
Who's gonna stop me?

768
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,100
One little girl

769
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,000
with one little gun?

770
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,300
Casey, this is
unacceptable.

771
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,300
Shut up, Chuck.

772
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,400
Try two little girls.

773
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,700
She looks good with a gun.

774
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,000
Morgan! Morgan!

775
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,700
Damn, Mom,
I got my headgear on.

776
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,600
Wake up. Wake up.

777
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Oh, thank God.

778
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,500
Oh, thank God.
Oh, God.

779
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,100
What are you
doing in here?

780
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
What are you...
what are you talking about?

781
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,200
You begged me not to leave.

782
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,900
Ow. Okay.

783
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,100
There's um...

784
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,500
oh, there's aspirin on
your side of the...

785
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,200
that side of the bed.

786
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,800
If you could get
me six, please?

787
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,300
Yeah. Anything you, uh,
anything you need.

788
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,100
Here.

789
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,300
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

790
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
For last night.

791
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,700
You know nothing happened.

792
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,100
Mostly thanks for that.

793
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,100
Look, Ellie, I would pretty much
do anything for you.

794
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,600
You're kind of like
a sister to me.

795
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,800
A sister I want
to have sex with so bad.

796
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,000
Oh, God, Morgan.

797
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,400
Whoa! Hey, big guy.
What's up, man?

798
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,100
Nothing-nothing
happening over here.

799
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,600
Just kind of...
Not the face!

800
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,200
Honey, come here.

801
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,300
I want to show
you something.

802
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,700
Happy Anniversary, baby.

803
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,600
Devon.

804
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,800
I'm sorry I got
so mad at you.

805
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
No, you were right.

806
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,100
I was being selfish.

807
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,800
I got a glimpse of what my life
would be like without you.

808
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Not a pretty picture.

809
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,100
Uh, dude?

810
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,100
I feel like I owe you
an explanation,

811
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,500
and I want you to know
that nothing happened

812
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,200
between me and your lady
last night, I swear.

813
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,000
I know, man.

814
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,500
What... wait.

815
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,500
What do you mean
"you know, man"?

816
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,400
You don't think there exists
a scenario where Ellie,

817
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,600
devastated over her loss of you,

818
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,300
comes into my arms
for the conso-lovin' prize?

819
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,300
Think about it.

820
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,000
No.

821
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,100
It was good
working with you, Casey.

822
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,100
You, too.

823
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,700
What does he think
he's doing?

824
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,700
Guess he's trying
to spy on us.

825
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,900
- He's got a lot to learn.
- Mm-hmm.

826
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,700
Well, I've got to go.

827
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,200
Victor's waiting
at the airport

828
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,900
at a holding cell.

829
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,700
His extradition papers
just came in.

830
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,600
Well, you lovebirds
have a safe flight.

831
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,500
Sorry you had to
blow your cover.

832
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,400
I'm gonna miss Ilsa.

833
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,700
I'm sure I'll find a new one.

834
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,400
I hope to meet her someday.

835
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,100
Well...

836
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,400
you better get going or you're
going to miss your flight.

837
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,900
Good-bye, Ilsa.

838
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,100
Good-bye, Casey.

839
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,800
Hey.

840
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,300
Just so you know.

841
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,900
I'm happy you're not dead.

842
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,900
What's up, killer?

843
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,400
You got yourself a new special
lady-friend, or what?

844
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,200
She's hopping a plane.

845
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,200
What? Are you serious?

846
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,000
You guys gonna
stay in touch?

847
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,000
She's going back undercover.

848
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,800
Wow, that really sucks.

849
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,600
It's a spy's life, Chuck.

850
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,400
Well, don't you worry, buddy.

851
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,200
You'll always have me,
I'm not going anywhere.

852
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,600
Uh-huh.

853
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,200
Well, Casey,

854
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,100
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

855
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,600
Hey!

856
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,600
Or not.

857
