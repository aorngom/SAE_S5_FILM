00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,110
Chapter Ten "1961"

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,533
This is just wrong...

3
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:30,700
Digging up these graves.

4
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:31,967
Why is she making us do this?

5
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:33,200
Mom has her reasons, Pete.

6
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:34,300
She'll share when she's ready.

7
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,401
Give her time.

8
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:51,501
Come on, give him a chance.

9
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:52,733
Why?

10
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,300
Look what he's turning us into.

11
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:55,633
He knows what he's done,

12
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,933
And he's carrying enough guilt for all of us.

13
00:00:57,967 --> 00:00:59,767
But he's here, isn't he?

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,467
He needs our support.

15
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:03,967
Boy, he charmed you.

16
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:09,234
Don't worry. It happens to all of us.

17
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:11,434
I'm gonna go talk to her.

18
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:22,933
What're we doing here, mom?

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You said we came here to find your sister.

20
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:29,867
We didn't know you had a sister.

21
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:33,034
Look, we need some answers.

22
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,467
Mom, what happened out here?

23
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,467
February,1961

24
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,501
Angela...

25
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,533
Angela and Alice Shaw.

26
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:08,267
Good. That's everybody.

27
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,467
Welcome to coyote sands.

28
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:13,100
My name is Dr. Chandra Suresh.

29
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,833
Please follow me.

30
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:16,467
Take a snack.

31
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,767
Playground.

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,234
The dining room.

33
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,666
Game room.

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,367
We show movies every night.

35
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:27,100
And the best popcorn you've ever had.

36
00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:28,933
You have a funny accent.

37
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:30,700
So do you.

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,267
So where are you from?

39
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:35,167
Bombay, India.

40
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,867
I've come a long way to meet you, to help you.

41
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,067
These are your quarters,

42
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:42,267
And your parents are just across the quad.

43
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:44,334
Dr. Zimmerman will show you the way.

44
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:50,533
Why do they have guns?

45
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:52,401
It's alarming, I know.

46
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,034
But this isn't a prison.

47
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:55,501
The guards are here for your protection.

48
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,467
We want to keep you safe.

49
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,733
Come on, let's get you settled.

50
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:14,034
I see you got the milk and cookies.

51
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,700
We wanted to give you the official welcome.

52
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,566
Welcome to crapola sands.

53
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,167
I'm Charles Deveaux.

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,867
The guy with the funny accent is Daniel Linderman.

55
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,067
And the guy with the glasses is Bobby Bishop.

56
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:31,467
I didn't think boys were allowed in the girls bunk.

57
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:33,401
Uh, yes, yes.

58
00:03:33,434 --> 00:03:34,800
Well, um, Bobby here...

59
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:36,034
He--he wanted to tell you

60
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,300
How beautiful he thought you were.

61
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:38,933
I--  I did not...

62
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,633
What?

63
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,100
You don't think she's beautiful?

64
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:45,900
Anyway, we just wanted to say hi.

65
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,967
I don't like this.

66
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,833
I want to be with mom and dad.

67
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,267
We already talked about this.

68
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,666
It's going to be fun.

69
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,300
Just like camp.

70
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,600
Let's get you unpacked.

71
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:06,800
There's only toys and books in here.

72
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:09,067
You said pack what I need.

73
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,300
You need clothes, Alice.

74
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:13,767
Pants, shirts, socks.

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,100
And how many times have you read Alice in wonderland?

76
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:23,933
I want to go home, banana.

77
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:25,600
And so do you.

78
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,401
Prom is coming.

79
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:31,234
The doctor told mom and dad that this place

80
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:33,100
Is going to make my nightmares go away.

81
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:34,967
No more screaming?

82
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,401
But what I have is genetic.

83
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:41,767
So we all need to deal with it.

84
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,234
The entire family.

85
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,067
Who snuck you out to see Sleeping Beauty?

86
00:04:47,134 --> 00:04:50,000
And who gave Jackie Jacobs an Indian burn

87
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:51,600
When she stole your barrette?

88
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,300
I will always be there for you.

89
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,167
I promise.

90
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:01,300
But I need you to be there for me, too.

91
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,100
See? Everything is going to be fine.

92
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:21,967
Mom?

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,733
My sister, my parents...

94
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,067
They all died here.

95
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:28,134
And if we don't come together,

96
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,966
If we don't settle our differences...

97
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:33,366
I'm afraid this street would repeat itself.

98
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,067
1961...

99
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,768
It was a different time.

100
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,167
Kennedy was president, and we were all patriots.

101
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:08,334
And when the government found out about us,

102
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,833
They told us they could cure us.

103
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,567
And we believed them.

104
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,034
And they rounded us all up, and they put us here.

105
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,200
What happened here?

106
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,933
I don't know. I was lucky; I survived.

107
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:24,501
But Alice, my entire family... didn't.

108
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,701
So why are we here, mom?

109
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:28,334
You could've told us this in a restaurant.

110
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:29,567
Why here?

111
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:31,534
Why are we digging up those bodies?

112
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:34,167
I've been dreaming about my sister.

113
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:38,067
Alive.

114
00:06:38,134 --> 00:06:40,768
That doesn't make sense.

115
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
But my dreams often don't.

116
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,434
They're open to interpretation.

117
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:48,334
They--they're confusing, but I think--I think...

118
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,134
I have to see her for myself.

119
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:51,674
I have to find her body, find a

120
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:53,134
Piece of cloth or something.

121
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:55,501
Anything to give her a proper burial.

122
00:06:55,534 --> 00:06:57,234
You should've told us about this place.

123
00:06:57,301 --> 00:07:00,334
That--that you had a sister.

124
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:01,634
I didn't want you to know the pain.

125
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:02,634
Mothers are allowed to do that.

126
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:03,900
I'm allowed to protect you.

127
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:07,000
You're absolutely allowed to do that, ma.

128
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:08,967
It's my nightmare, peter.

129
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:12,200
I never wanted you to know what i suffered.

130
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:13,900
I tried to forget.

131
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,867
We made everyone forget.

132
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:18,434
Who's "We"?

133
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:21,434
How do you think The company was formed?

134
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:25,301
It started here with a vow to never let this happen again.

135
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:27,601
We destroyed files.

136
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:28,833
Erased memories.

137
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:31,401
We blackmailed, we killed.

138
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:33,967
Anything to keep our existence secret.

139
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:37,567
And it worked...for 50 years.

140
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:41,301
Now Noah and I have tried to fix this current situation,

141
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,867
But mr. Danko has proved resourceful.

142
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:48,234
So that's what you were trying to do.

143
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,601
Yes.

144
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,200
But you blew it.

145
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:54,067
Yeah.

146
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,967
The important thing is to put our secret back...

147
00:07:58,034 --> 00:07:59,700
So we can all stop running,

148
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,367
return to our lives.

149
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,167
It's time to go back to the old methods.

150
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,301
You mean erasing people's memories and killing?

151
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:09,933
It's a necessary evil.

152
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,401
I'm sorry what happened here, mom.

153
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:14,967
But it didn't give you the right

154
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:16,301
to do the things that you've done,

155
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,434
And it still doesn't.

156
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:20,567
We need you, peter.

157
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:22,833
I need you.

158
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,100
Your company tore this family a part,

159
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,134
I'm not going to be a part of it again.

160
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:29,567
Peter!

161
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:30,768
I'll get him.

162
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:46,367
You had a nightmare.

163
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:49,134
What's it to you?

164
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,434
I think I heard you talking to your sister

165
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:51,967
about how your nightmares come true.

166
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,234
Look, you're not the only one who's realized

167
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,000
That something strange is happening to them.

168
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:59,634
I don't know what you're talking about.

169
00:08:59,668 --> 00:09:01,900
- Linderman.   - how'd a pretty skirt like you

170
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:04,100
Get a scar like that?

171
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:06,768
A bicycle accident.

172
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,301
This place is one big science experiment.

173
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:20,534
And we're the rats.

174
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,167
You're wrong.

175
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,434
They're going to help us.

176
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:25,034
She's right.

177
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,900
We're freaks.

178
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,534
They're going to make us normal.

179
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,334
And you're blind.

180
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,867
Why do you think they have armed guards?

181
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:34,334
We've done nothing wrong.

182
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:36,134
It's not like we're communists.

183
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,867
My dad said we can trust them.

184
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,634
This has happened before.

185
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:41,367
Nazis with the jews.

186
00:09:41,434 --> 00:09:44,067
America did it too...with the japs.

187
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:45,567
This is different.

188
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:46,701
We're different.

189
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:49,867
What was your nightmare?

190
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:54,000
My dreams are confusing.

191
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:56,534
They're not always right.

192
00:09:58,034 --> 00:10:00,467
You have to stop being afraid...

193
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:02,933
And start believing.

194
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:10,800
That doctor...

195
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:13,267
Suresh.

196
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:18,601
Don't trust him.

197
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:22,267
What're you talking about?

198
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:24,367
Nothing.

199
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:26,200
We're all going back to sleep.

200
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:38,467
My feet are cold, Banana.

201
00:10:38,534 --> 00:10:40,634
That's what you get for not bringing any socks.

202
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:42,601
I'll find you some.

203
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:46,634
Say good night, Alice.

204
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:48,234
Good night, Alice.

205
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:57,334
I heard what you were saying to the boys.

206
00:10:57,401 --> 00:10:59,601
About doctor Suresh.

207
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:02,301
Those boys just have an overactive imagination.

208
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,601
Remember when I got an F in history?

209
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:13,167
Dad took away the tv and dessert.

210
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:17,434
I was so mad that i--

211
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:24,534
That night, a hail storm smashed his car.

212
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:28,467
So?

213
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:38,267
I think i can control the weather.

214
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:58,567
Is doctor suresh going to come for me?

215
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:08,600
Why didn't you tell nathan and peter

216
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,867
about your sister?

217
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:12,134
Where's your father?

218
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:17,867
I asked for some alone time with you.

219
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,034
I want to help you.

220
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:26,000
I was almost your age when i came here.

221
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:27,601
I was 16.

222
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:30,467
Every other thought was about boys and the prom.

223
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:32,734
I was so naive.

224
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,668
I wish i had had half of your strength.

225
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:38,867
You have courage and self confidence.

226
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:41,734
You--you've overcome all those nagging self-doubts.

227
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,634
Maybe sometimes.

228
00:12:44,668 --> 00:12:45,933
Not always.

229
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,668
I'm still figuring it out.

230
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:53,267
You dug up those graves without batting an eye.

231
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:55,367
If i had had your spirit,

232
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:58,000
If i had trusted myself,

233
00:12:58,034 --> 00:12:59,800
Maybe things would've been different here.

234
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:03,501
Doesn't answer my question.

235
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,367
You ever do something so awful,

236
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:08,401
Something you are so ashamed of

237
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:10,367
That you think If you ever talk about it,

238
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:12,401
You might never stop crying?

239
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,800
Where did this come from?

240
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:26,000
This is what happened in my dream.

241
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:27,534
It's impossible!

242
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:28,534
But it is...

243
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:29,668
It's her!

244
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:30,768
It's alice!

245
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:08,401
Something you are so ashamed of

246
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:10,367
That you think if you ever talk about it,

247
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:12,401
You might never stop crying?

248
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,800
Where did this come from?

249
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:26,000
This is what happened in my dream.

250
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:27,534
It's impossible!

251
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:28,534
But it is...

252
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:29,668
It's her!

253
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:30,768
It's Alice!

254
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:35,701
Dad!

255
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:41,067
Alice!

256
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:45,476
Alice!

257
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,737
Come on! We got to get back inside.

258
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,134
You need to see a menu?

259
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:11,333
No, just a cup of coffee, please.

260
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,199
Pete, we need to get through.

261
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:22,400
Whatever it is, it's between us.

262
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:24,100
You're not helping things by running away every time things

263
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,266
Run away?

264
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,333
So when you just disappear,

265
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,733
You up and disappear and go forever.

266
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,000
You went instead of staying in Washington

267
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:33,533
And dealing with a problem that you created.

268
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:38,466
Pete, you know, nobody can look down their nose at me

269
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,700
Better than you.

270
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,700
1986 Mets. you remember that?

271
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:43,967
Yeah.

272
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:46,067
How dad had two tickets to the world series,

273
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:49,767
And he had two other tickets to the playoffs.

274
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
And you convinced me to go to the play-offs with him.

275
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,667
I wanted to make sure you got to see a game

276
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:57,767
Come on, pete,

277
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,633
I couldn't have known the Mets were gonna beat the Astros.

278
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:03,667
Come on, you got to see Mookie Wilson in that game six.

279
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,800
You saw him.

280
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,266
I got lucky.

281
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:08,633
- You got to see that game. - I got lucky.

282
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,166
You think I conned you?

283
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:11,767
Into seeing a play-off game?

284
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,266
Yes. I do.

285
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,867
Because even in your generosity,

286
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:17,533
Nathan, you are selfish.

287
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,633
And that is just who you are.

288
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,199
Pete...

289
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:24,366
We have got to find a way to forgive each other.

290
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:27,700
We have to find the capacity for forgiveness.

291
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:30,433
- Because without that... - I am trying...

292
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,967
Really hard.

293
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,134
This is the emergency broadcast network.

294
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,333
A severe storm warning is in effect

295
00:15:39,366 --> 00:15:41,833
For the greater valley area.

296
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,433
Claire!

297
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:54,333
Claire!

298
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,767
How did you find me?

299
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,366
Are there more agents coming?

300
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,833
I'm not working with them anymore.

301
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,700
I tried to stop them from the inside.

302
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:10,833
And they found out.

303
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,466
You expect me to believe that?

304
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:14,800
It's the truth. I tried...and I failed.

305
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:16,299
Angela Petrelli brought us here.

306
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:18,800
Why? What business does she have here?

307
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:20,100
She was taken here as a child.

308
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:22,366
This was a place for people with abilities,

309
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,700
Experimenting, and eventually murder.

310
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:26,867
What?

311
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,733
They killed hundreds.

312
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:30,433
The graves are outside.

313
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,067
What're you doing here?

314
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,767
I found this.

315
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,199
50 yea ago, my father was a doctor here.

316
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:46,733
I came to find out what he was doing.

317
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:50,034
Now, I'm not so sure I want to know.

318
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:58,833
Hello, Alice.

319
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,700
Angela, can I talk with you?

320
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:03,433
Yes, of course, Dr. Suresh.

321
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:05,000
It's okay, Alice.

322
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:34,166
Three wavy lines.

323
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:38,299
Who are they?

324
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:39,566
Don't worry about them.

325
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:41,000
Just focus on the cards.

326
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:42,299
Okay?

327
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,333
Let's try again.

328
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:47,067
A triangle.

329
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,750
I'm not reading your mind

330
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,400
If that's what you think.

331
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:57,900
I had a dream about this, about you showing me cards.

332
00:17:57,967 --> 00:17:59,433
A dream?

333
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:03,233
About this exact moment?

334
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,134
And does everything you dream come true?

335
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:08,134
They're dreams, they're confusing.

336
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:09,900
And what else have you dreamt about?

337
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,767
About you.

338
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,199
You're going to kill everybody here.

339
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,533
My parents.

340
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:23,233
My sister.

341
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,900
I can assure you...

342
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,900
That's not going to happen.

343
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:33,400
You are a good man.

344
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:36,034
And you've treated us with nothing but kindness.

345
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:38,250
But I'm telling you

346
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,433
It's going to get out of your control.

347
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,299
If you leave, it destroys all our work.

348
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:44,967
Don't you see the benefits

349
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:47,333
Your abilities could have for the world?

350
00:18:47,366 --> 00:18:51,034
I only see my nightmares.

351
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:52,833
Einstein said,

352
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:54,633
"the life of the individual has meaning¡°

353
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,034
"only as so far as

354
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,433
It aids in making the life of every living thing

355
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,933
Nobler and more beautiful."

356
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
You have read einstein.

357
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,533
No, I just dreamt that you would say that.

358
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,433
You said yourself that dreams are confusing.

359
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:16,900
Open to interpretation.

360
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:18,466
Everything is going to be fine, Angela.

361
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,466
Now...this won't hurt a bit.

362
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,034
I tried to warn them!

363
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,433
I tried to make them stop.

364
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:32,833
I tried to save them, save Alice.

365
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,600
And now Alice is alive.

366
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:37,134
If this is your sister, then why is she doing this?

367
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,867
She's angry.

368
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,266
You don't believe me.

369
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:42,500
Storms happen.

370
00:19:42,566 --> 00:19:43,967
It's my sister!

371
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,233
What if it's not?!

372
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:47,733
No. I need to go find her.

373
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:49,867
I need to deal with this alone.

374
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:52,667
No! It's too dangerous out there!

375
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:13,633
Are you okay?

376
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:14,700
What is it?

377
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:18,421
Your mom. She's gone

378
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,901
So what?

379
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,966
My father was Dr. Mengele?

380
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,966
You don't know what happened here.

381
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:45,434
It's hard to ignore facts.

382
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,734
Which are what?

383
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:47,901
He worked here.

384
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:49,801
Everyone died, he survived.

385
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,667
The most obvious answer is usually the right one.

386
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,933
Working with the enemy

387
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,500
Doesn't necessarily make you the enemy.

388
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:58,434
You should know that.

389
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,133
I met your father. He was a good man.

390
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,434
You don't know what he did, what he faced.

391
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,700
What his intentions were.

392
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:06,667
Who are we talking about?

393
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:11,066
Just, don't make any assumptions.

394
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:13,400
Not until you know the truth.

395
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,033
Any sign of my mother?

396
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:18,634
No. Nothing.

397
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,267
She's got to be around here somewhere.

398
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,000
Let's split up.

399
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:23,267
Cover more ground that way.

400
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,700
No one should be alone.

401
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,634
Suresh...

402
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,066
Will you go with Peter?

403
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,901
There's no sign of her.

404
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:40,267
Do you really think her sister survived this?

405
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,667
I don't know.

406
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:46,400
What was this place?

407
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:49,534
It's where he experimented on them.

408
00:21:52,434 --> 00:21:54,734
I guess we're destined to repeat our parents' mistakes.

409
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:57,100
How do you mean?

410
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,400
I mean I am my father's son.

411
00:22:02,734 --> 00:22:04,634
Experimenting on human guinea pigs.

412
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,600
And why?

413
00:22:07,634 --> 00:22:09,066
Not for science.

414
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,667
For self interest.

415
00:22:12,734 --> 00:22:14,534
You're being too hard on yourself, Mohinder.

416
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:18,434
We started this a long time ago, okay? You and me.

417
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:21,000
I know you. You're a good person.

418
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:23,133
Good intentions only go so far, Peter.

419
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,367
I am weak.

420
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:26,767
I'm corruptible.

421
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:29,233
- And I am selfish. - We're all selfish.

422
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,467
My brother has proven that point time and time again.

423
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:35,801
I know what it's like to have parents who are...

424
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,600
Less than.

425
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,534
My mother brought us here

426
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,667
Because she wants to start a new company.

427
00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:44,966
She thinks it's the only way to keep this

428
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,534
From happening again.

429
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,734
But that first company she started was corrupt.

430
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:49,867
Yes, but why?

431
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:51,933
And was it surviving this?

432
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:54,084
I mean, this has to come with

433
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:56,066
With fear and pain and anger.

434
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:58,801
Maybe that's why you can get it right...

435
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:00,534
Because you never knew this pain.

436
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,367
I have to believe that there is hope for redemption.

437
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:04,901
I have to.

438
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,834
Even for Nathan.

439
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:15,033
You and Peter going to be all right?

440
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,167
I don't know.

441
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,966
He blames me for everything.

442
00:23:20,418 --> 00:23:23,006
Can't say as I entirely disagree.

443
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:26,333
You and I have made a mess of things.

444
00:23:28,634 --> 00:23:29,700
Yes, we did.

445
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:38,834
Danko is working with Sylar.

446
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:42,400
Sylar can change his shape. he can be anybody.

447
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,767
He almost made me kill my wife.

448
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:51,367
What was the last book you read?

449
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,333
Cause I can't remember.

450
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,767
Not the last book I read...

451
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:59,500
Last movie I saw...

452
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:02,033
You remember movie nights?

453
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,500
We used to rent old movies...

454
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:05,867
Make popcorn.

455
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,634
When do we get to go back?

456
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,867
I don't know.

457
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:12,600
I miss it, too.

458
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:15,167
You know, I should be a basket case.

459
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,500
Digging up graves.

460
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:21,534
I should be, but I'm not.

461
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:25,600
I'm just...not.

462
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:29,434
I tried so hard to impress you.

463
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,734
Both of you.

464
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:34,667
Becoming an agent, trying to stop the bad guys.

465
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:36,767
What you did was very brave.

466
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:38,600
I was an idiot.

467
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:41,901
All I wanted to do was grow up.

468
00:24:43,534 --> 00:24:45,634
Honey, that's all any teenager ever wants.

469
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,100
But you can't fault yourself for that.

470
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:53,400
Maybe not.

471
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:55,467
Maybe I can.

472
00:24:57,367 --> 00:25:01,467
There was a time where I wanted to become a doctor.

473
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:06,534
A chef. Class president.

474
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:10,434
Not an agent.

475
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:21,400
- Say your goodbyes, all right? - Are you sure?

476
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,933
Do we have to go right now?

477
00:25:23,966 --> 00:25:27,100
Yeah. Linderman and Bob are already on the outside.

478
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:29,500
We're gotta go right now, while they're changing guards.

479
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:30,867
It's our best chance to sneak out.

480
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:33,367
Figure out where we are, how we can get help,

481
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:34,767
And save everyone.

482
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,767
Look, this is your plan.

483
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:40,167
I know. it's just alice--

484
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,700
Look, she can't come.

485
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:42,767
It's dangerous.

486
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:44,066
She'll slow us down.

487
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:46,033
I promised her I'd never leave her alone.

488
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,233
I get it.

489
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,534
But we need you too.

490
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,834
So keep her calm.

491
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:52,167
Make sure she doesn't blow this.

492
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,167
How?

493
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,534
Lie.

494
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,434
What were you talking about?

495
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,966
Me and the boys are going to go sneak out tonight.

496
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,867
Cool, I'm coming too.

497
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:16,100
No.

498
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:17,400
Why not?

499
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:19,167
Because you can't, okay?

500
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:21,734
I just want to hang out with kids my own age.

501
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:23,000
Are you going to make out?

502
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:25,200
No, don't think like that.

503
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:27,300
We'll be back in a few.

504
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:28,867
Cover for us.

505
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:31,801
I'm scared.

506
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:39,066
Listen.

507
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:41,033
I had a dream last night.

508
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,000
About you.

509
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:45,867
And it's going to be safe here.

510
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:47,400
I swear.

511
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:48,867
You just have to stay here.

512
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:50,901
We'll be right back.

513
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:55,267
Now say good night, Alice.

514
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:58,133
Good night, Alice.

515
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,066
Alice...

516
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,500
Look at me.

517
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:30,267
Please, just...

518
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:34,066
Turn around.

519
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,267
Talk to me.

520
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,260
May 1961,coyote sands cafe.

521
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:58,267
The cops don't believe me.

522
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,267
Come on, we have to convince them.

523
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,100
Someone.

524
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:06,966
This is serious and you guys are acting like children.

525
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:08,699
We're enjoying the moment.

526
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:10,400
Do you want a fry?

527
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,300
Come on.

528
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,534
Let's have a dance.

529
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,567
You missed your prom,

530
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,733
And you love this song.

531
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:21,433
I never told you that.

532
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,567
We don't allow that in here.

533
00:29:57,634 --> 00:29:59,333
No dancing. not with a colored.

534
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:06,699
We didn't mean anything by it.

535
00:30:06,766 --> 00:30:09,699
Just pretend like this never happened.

536
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,433
Your ability?

537
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,866
We don't have to be afraid, Angela.

538
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:26,066
Socks!

539
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:27,300
We need to get socks.

540
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,367
For Alice.

541
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,733
This is the emergency broadcast network.

542
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,733
A severe storm warning is in effect.

543
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,866
Flash floods and high winds have come out of nowhere.

544
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,033
We have to get back to Alice.

545
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:42,300
Now!

546
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,167
I'm alive.

547
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,433
You're not going crazy.

548
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,167
I almost didn't recognize you.

549
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:04,400
You look so old.

550
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:06,766
Do I look old?

551
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,933
No.

552
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,534
You look beautiful.

553
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:15,333
Alice, how is this possible?

554
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:17,500
How?

555
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:20,433
Have you been here for 50 years?

556
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:29,233
When I found this place, it was packed with food.

557
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:34,066
When I went through that, I did what I had to do.

558
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,066
I stole...what I needed.

559
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:46,699
Clothes, food, stuff.

560
00:31:46,733 --> 00:31:48,900
Why did you stay?

561
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:52,534
You told me.

562
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:54,534
Your dream.

563
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:58,066
You said I'd be safe if I stayed here.

564
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,933
I--

565
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:01,866
And I trusted you.

566
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:05,133
I thought I'd be safe here.

567
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:08,233
And the world would be safe...

568
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:09,866
From me.

569
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:13,333
From you?

570
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:21,133
Oh, Alice.

571
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:23,766
The night I left...

572
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,699
What happened that night, Alice?

573
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:36,233
When you left...

574
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,300
That doctor...Suresh...

575
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:45,000
He came for me.

576
00:32:52,966 --> 00:32:53,966
No.

577
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:57,766
Alice...

578
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,133
Stop!

579
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,799
Alice! alice, wait! alice!

580
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,933
It's okay. it's okay, Alice!

581
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,167
It's okay!

582
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,433
Alice!

583
00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:26,833
Sorry.

584
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,699
Get back inside now!

585
00:33:57,933 --> 00:33:59,833
You don't have to stay here anymore.

586
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,167
Let me help you.

587
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:05,400
It's time to go home.

588
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:11,200
I have socks for you.

589
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:17,567
Since that night, whenever I feel lost...

590
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,367
Whenever I don't know what to do...

591
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:24,634
I steal socks for you.

592
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,833
To remind myself there are simple ways

593
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,233
To protect the ones we love.

594
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:34,400
You don't ever have to be cold again.

595
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,300
I am so sorry.

596
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,933
Oh, banana! it's not your fault.

597
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:51,433
Yes, it is.

598
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:54,267
I lied to you... that night.

599
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,534
I thought I was doing the right thing.

600
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,799
I was trying to protect you.

601
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,833
- I was trying to save you. - You...

602
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:06,033
I'm so sorry.

603
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,100
You...

604
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,966
- You... - I'm so sorry!

605
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,799
mom!

606
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,167
calm down!

607
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,200
alice, calm down!

608
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:29,600
calm down!

609
00:35:29,634 --> 00:35:31,766
no!

610
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,699
no...

611
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:42,333
I have to talk to her.

612
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:43,567
She's going to kill you.

613
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:46,699
no, I have to talk to her.

614
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:51,500
alice!

615
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,200
Stop!

616
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:55,900
This isn't their fault.

617
00:35:55,966 --> 00:35:58,100
This is your family.

618
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:00,634
This is my son.

619
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:03,467
He's your nephew, alice.

620
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,200
You have a family.

621
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:10,100
And they're the only ones who can make everything all right.

622
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,699
Don't punish them for my mistakes.

623
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,766
I am so sorry.

624
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:27,733
Come on.

625
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:30,233
Let's get out of here.

626
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:32,200
Let's go home.

627
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:35,766
Say goodbye, alice.

628
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
No!

629
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,334
Alice is gone.

630
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:15,667
She's nowhere.

631
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,866
Judging from her reaction,

632
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:18,800
I think i know what my father was doing here.

633
00:37:18,866 --> 00:37:20,634
Your father...

634
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:22,000
I found this.

635
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,933
In the lab.

636
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,866
It might give you some answers about your father.

637
00:37:30,766 --> 00:37:32,167
I don't know...

638
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:35,167
The storm covered the graves. They're all buried.

639
00:37:35,234 --> 00:37:36,833
Maybe it should remain that way.

640
00:37:36,866 --> 00:37:38,467
Fair enough.

641
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,900
Let's get out of here.

642
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,133
I'm not going with you, peter.

643
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:47,234
Why not?

644
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,234
Maybe you're ready to move on,

645
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,334
But I'm not.

646
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:54,267
I'm not ready to forgive myself.

647
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:55,667
Not yet.

648
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:29,900
We can never let this happen again.

649
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:32,334
Not ever.

650
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
No one can know about us.

651
00:38:34,434 --> 00:38:36,067
They already do.

652
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:37,534
Not for long.

653
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:39,167
I had a dream...

654
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,267
About the future.

655
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:43,866
We're going to form a group.

656
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:45,634
A company.

657
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:48,267
It's going to protect people like us.

658
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,967
We're just kids.

659
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:52,133
Not anymore we're not.

660
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:56,167
What do we do in this dream?

661
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:58,267
Whatever we have to.

662
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,334
They're right to be afraid of us.

663
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,500
The things we can do...

664
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:07,733
The things we're going to do to keep this secret safe.

665
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,100
It's a necessary evil.

666
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:35,933
I'm never going to see her again.

667
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:37,800
You don't know that.

668
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:45,701
I get it, mom.

669
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:48,900
the guilt, the...

670
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:51,634
But you got to let go of that.

671
00:39:53,701 --> 00:39:55,766
Come join us?

672
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:02,000
Come on.

673
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,967
Okay, please someone say something.

674
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:30,733
How are the fries?

675
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,900
Look, this isn't a company.

676
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,634
This is a family.

677
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,667
There's a big difference.

678
00:40:38,733 --> 00:40:42,033
Families have the capacity for forgiveness.

679
00:40:43,634 --> 00:40:44,833
You mean that?

680
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:46,500
We're stronger together than we are apart.

681
00:40:46,534 --> 00:40:48,967
So there's no more hunting.

682
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,234
We've got to make our existence secret.

683
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:57,200
And try to put our lives back together.

684
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,534
All right, so what now?

685
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:05,733
I'll go back to washington.

686
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:09,367
Take ownership of my mistakes.

687
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,833
- And talk to the president.

688
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,400
Looks like you already have.

689
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:15,967
The only real way to bring change

690
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:21,000
Is to bring real purpose back to the white house.

691
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:22,300
And I promise you...

692
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:23,866
- Who the hell is that? -that change will come

693
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,434
- To this country. - sylar.

694
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,866
And nothing...

695
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,500
will ever be the same.

696
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,434
Thank you all very much.

697
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:36,500
I'll take a few questions.

698
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:37,701
Elizabeth.

699
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:39,033
Yes, sir, thank you.

700
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:40,967
The american people are in financial crisis now...

701
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
To be continued...
