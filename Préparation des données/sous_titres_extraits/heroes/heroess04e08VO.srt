1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,793


2
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:04,671
I think we've found someone
who can help us fix the past.

3
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:06,691
I need you to send me back.

4
00:00:06,858 --> 00:00:08,569
You have a rare gift, you know.

5
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:11,803
To right the wrongs of your life,
undo your mistakes.

6
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,472
You can never change the past.
It's bad, always.

7
00:00:15,147 --> 00:00:17,535
Everything is connected.
It's the butterfly effect.

8
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:21,104


9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,772


10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,585


11
00:00:24,603 --> 00:00:26,101


12
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,068


13
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,945


14
00:00:30,395 --> 00:00:31,895
I had a friend once.

15
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,910
She knew she was dying,
but that didn't push her off her path.

16
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,453
Her name was Charlie.

17
00:00:38,113 --> 00:00:40,832
Oh, my God!
I can't believe I left her off the list.

18
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:43,460
You promised you would stay in bed.

19
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:02,084
Charlie!

20
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,771
Cute butt, hon.

21
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:12,810
Freeze!

22
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:15,545
Them's my daddy's clothes
you're stealing.

23
00:01:16,624 --> 00:01:19,579
I'm sorry,
but this is a matter of life and death.

24
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,916
Destiny has sent me here
to save the life of the woman I love.

25
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:24,536
Love?

26
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:27,671
There ain't no such thing.

27
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:29,336
Oh, yes, there is.

28
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:31,216
My love's name is Charlie.

29
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:34,619
You've heard the story before.

30
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:37,222
Boy meets girl.

31
00:01:37,812 --> 00:01:40,308
Anything looking good, guys?
What's that on your jacket?

32
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:43,770
That means
"I don't belong here", right?

33
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,230
Boy falls in love.

34
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,284
Perfecto.

35
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:49,693
You ready for disco.

36
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:51,903
Girl dies.

37
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:56,449
Boy travels back through time
to try to save her life.

38
00:01:58,387 --> 00:02:00,537
Charlie was my heart, my world.

39
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,591
My happily ever after.

40
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:06,503
I did everything I could
to try and save her life.

41
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:09,084
But life isn't a fairy tale.

42
00:02:09,582 --> 00:02:11,798
No matter how hard I tried,
the brain man,

43
00:02:12,484 --> 00:02:14,762
Sylar, always killed her.

44
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:16,129
When she died,

45
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,269
I lost a part of myself.

46
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:20,140
My greatest failure.

47
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:24,362
Now I've come back in time
to try again.

48
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:28,029
To save Charlie, and this time
I will defeat the brain man.

49
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,900
What's a brain man?

50
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:35,840
It's okay.

51
00:02:36,183 --> 00:02:38,278
I will make sure
he doesn't hurt anybody.

52
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:40,368
I'm the good guy.

53
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:43,204
Good guys wear white hats.

54
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,540
Bad guys...

55
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:47,205
wear black hats.

56
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,179
Do you mind?

57
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:07,729
He was wearing a black hat.

58
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:15,570
Oh, boy.

60
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:31,994


61
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:33,681
How's Arnold?

62
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:36,341
Dying.

63
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:40,065
It might be tonight.

64
00:03:40,232 --> 00:03:41,782
Sooner, I don't know.

65
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,393
My family's shrinking,
our graveyard's getting bigger.

66
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:50,451
We need Hiro Nakamura.

67
00:03:50,618 --> 00:03:53,452
- You said he was on a path.
- And it's a damn long walk.

68
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,402
We need him now.
It's not going to be easy.

69
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:59,280
Come on, you can convince an apple
that it's an orange.

70
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,010
I know.

71
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:05,995
We need him to fix the past.

72
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,798
It's just, I don't know how
I'm going to convince him.

73
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:11,584
Desperate times, desperate measures.

74
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,461
And all of that.

75
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,522
He's in love.

76
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:34,399
Her name is Charlie.

77
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,944
There's a problem.

78
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,159
She's dead.

79
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:40,626
Three years ago.

80
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:43,867
That's not a problem.
That's a... opportunity.

81
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:48,219
There's more.

82
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:50,915
There's a lot more.

83
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,133
Now how are you
going to get back there?

84
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:12,391
I'll have to ask my dying
friend to help me again.

85
00:05:12,558 --> 00:05:13,728
You can't.

86
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:15,982
We all have sacrifices to make.

87
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:19,405
Desperate times,

88
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:21,345
desperate measures.

89
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:23,118
And all that.

90
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:30,445


91
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,502
Warm you up?

92
00:05:37,218 --> 00:05:38,718
Well, if you please.

93
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:42,162
Nice watch.

94
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:44,594
That's a...
Sylar field edition, right?

95
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,147
 Those were modeled after the watch
that allied commander Pershing

96
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,974
brought back from Russia after WWI.

97
00:05:50,302 --> 00:05:52,602
- Are you a collector?
- I'm... no.

98
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,109
No, I just... I read about him
in a magazine

99
00:05:55,276 --> 00:05:56,424
And just remembered.

100
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:59,580
Something my brain's been doing,
just remembering everything.

101
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,860
Everything.

102
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,779
I'm my very own Wikipedia.

103
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:06,366
Okay, who won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964?

104
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:07,867
Luther King.

105
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,786
- 1986?
- Elie Wiesel.

106
00:06:12,056 --> 00:06:14,123
What's the most common
cause of death?

107
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:15,625
Heart attacks.

108
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,460
What's the best thing on the menu?

109
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,966
Tahitian pancakes.

110
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,848
Fruit cocktail with coconut shavings.
It's yummy.

111
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,553
Do you think
that your genius memory is...

112
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,514
because of that clot in your brain?

113
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:35,403
- How did you...
- I have a gift too.

114
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:38,564
I can see how things work...

115
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,068
How to fix them if they're broken.

116
00:06:44,535 --> 00:06:45,835
One look at you,

117
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:48,216
it's plain as day.

118
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:59,357
I will try those Tahitian pancakes.
Thank you very much.

119
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,384
Smart move, hiding like that.

120
00:07:06,823 --> 00:07:10,430
- You, from the carnival, butterfly man.
- We need to talk, Hiro. Now.

121
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:13,430
No, that's not what I'm saying,
Sandra.

122
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,590
Of course I want to be there
for homecoming.

123
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:20,001
I don't want to disappoint Claire,
but I don't control my work schedule.

124
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:23,455
I'll... I'll pick up milk
on the way home.

125
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:25,753
And the greenies
for Muggles, right. Okay.

126
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:28,761
Love you. Bye.

127
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,950
Sorry I'm late.

128
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,944
Traffic was actually a bitch.

129
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,914
Homecoming, hooray!

130
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,337
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, fine.

131
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,048
- You're making the face.
- I'm not making the face.

132
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,594
- Yeah.
- I don't make faces.

133
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:48,718
Yes, you do.
Every time you lie to Sandra,

134
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,679
your eyebrows furrow,
and you get this line right here.

135
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,078
I wish I could tell her the truth,
and tell her

136
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:56,684
I'm going to miss homecoming
because I'm trying to catch

137
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,896
a deranged serial killer
with super powers.

138
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:04,242
You know what?

139
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,572
I'm trying to save our daughter's life,
and I can't even tell her.

140
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:13,701
The lying sucks.
It does.

141
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:19,074
Especially to family,
I wish I could tell my mom that...

142
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:21,834
I missed my nephew's Bar Mitzvah
because I was busy bagging

143
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,837
a guy who can shoot fire
out of his nose,

144
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:27,757
- But... I can't.
- So what'd you tell her?

145
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:28,883
PMS.

146
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,533
I don't think
that would work for me.

147
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:35,348
This is nice.

148
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:38,601
What is nice?

149
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,309
Being able to, you know,
not be so guarded, not be on...

150
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:45,149
just nice to have a friend
I can talk to.

151
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:48,653
Is that what this is?
Two friends talking?

152
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:54,575
- What would you call it?
- Flirting.

153
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,286
It's just been so long,
you don't recognize it.

154
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:58,606
No, it's not.

155
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:02,087
We've been having breakfast
twice a week for months now,

156
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:04,020
miles out of town.

157
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,036
I mean, the pancakes
are not that good.

158
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:12,635
No, they're not.

159
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:18,015
You and I,
we can talk about anything.

160
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:21,060
It's more than friends.

161
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,484
And you're such a cowboy,
you'd never admit it,

162
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:26,101
so I'm taking the initiative,
and I...

163
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,697
booked a motel room.

164
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,365
Crazy, right?

165
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:37,763
Or not.

166
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:52,167
No, no, no, no.

167
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:54,837
I will be right there.
Don't do anything until I get there.

168
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:58,032
Ethan's here
with the sylar paintings.

169
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:00,018
Go.
I'll meet you at the office.

170
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:19,973
Are you a time traveler too?
Are you following me?

171
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,902
- Why are you here, butterfly man?
- The question is: why are you here?

172
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:24,381
I'm here to save Charlie.

173
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:26,459
And why would you be doing
something like that?

174
00:10:27,255 --> 00:10:29,127
You told me I could
right the wrongs of my life

175
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:32,131
by stepping on the right butterflies.
This is the biggest. It's Mothra.

176
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,135
I'm here to make sure
you understand the magnitude

177
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,678
of your endeavor.

178
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,178
To protect you.

179
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,349
This isn't a simple spilled slushy.

180
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,599
Look.

181
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,896
You were on a specific path.
Everyone was.

182
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,857
Sylar and Peter and Claire.

183
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:54,403
I'm making a tremendous sacrifice
to make sure you succeed, Hiro.

184
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:57,323
This place is a mine field.

185
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,660
One mistake here,
and it's kablooey history.

186
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,615
Awful lot of trouble for one girl.

187
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:04,484
Pretty as Little Susie flapjacks is,

188
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:06,415
is she absolutely worth it?

189
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,058


190
00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:07,977


191
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:12,423


192
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,157


193
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,973


194
00:12:17,005 --> 00:12:18,192


195
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:19,316


196
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:20,977


197
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:36,408


198
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,673


199
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:41,093


200
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,432


201
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:50,785


202
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:54,147


203
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,818


204
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:58,758


205
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:01,322


206
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,747


207
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,839


208
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,639


209
00:13:38,904 --> 00:13:40,840


210
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:41,618


211
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:44,110


212
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:44,776


213
00:13:44,943 --> 00:13:47,050


214
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:49,452


215
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:50,313


216
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,941


217
00:13:54,257 --> 00:13:56,614


218
00:13:58,052 --> 00:14:00,047


219
00:14:00,362 --> 00:14:03,463


220
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:06,428


221
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:08,124


222
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:08,755


223
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:09,765


224
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:11,069


225
00:14:11,668 --> 00:14:12,805


226
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:14,061


227
00:14:14,598 --> 00:14:15,732


228
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:16,845


229
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:18,646


230
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,055


231
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,026


232
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:22,570


233
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,114


234
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,408


235
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:29,243


236
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:32,344


237
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,405


238
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:35,457


239
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:37,136


240
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:38,704


241
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:39,628


242
00:14:41,788 --> 00:14:43,924


243
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,806


244
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,989
Isaac?

245
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,784
This is Mr. Bennet,
the man I told you about.

246
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,290
This girl.
The one you've painted here.

247
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,916
And here.

248
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,084
And there.

249
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,253
She's my daughter.

250
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,464
You're not the only one
with special abilities.

251
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:27,551
There are others.
Sylar is killing them.

252
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,094
One at a time.

253
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,307
If you know who he is,
why can't you stop him?

254
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,352
Nobody knows what he looks like.
That's why I need your help.

255
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,520
To do what?

256
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,439
You know,

257
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,274
14 years ago,

258
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,111
a woman left behind a baby girl
with no one to take care of her.

259
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:49,114
My wife and I...

260
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,159
had been having trouble conceiving
a child of our own at the time...

261
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,119
It was like...

262
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,540
God had reached down
and given us a miracle.

263
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,258
This is my daughter
we're talking about.

264
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,604
I was eavesdropping, sorry,
but I heard everything.

265
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,405
I had no idea.

266
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,284
You and I will handle this, okay?

267
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,848
I'm such an ass.
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,271
Look, homecoming isn't for 37 hours.

269
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,858
37 hours and 17 minutes.

270
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,735
We're made of time.

271
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,905
We'll nail this guy.

272
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:16,410
And this thing here... just
pretend it never happened, okay?

273
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,455
- I'm haitianing you.
- No.

274
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,124
Don't haitian me.

275
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,126
I don't want to forget.

276
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,430
Everything all right, Hiro?

277
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,058
Okay, cowboy.

278
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,435
Why do you look like
the cat who ate the canary?

279
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,563
I did it.
No kablooey, see?

280
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,398
Sweet.

281
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,318
I understand
why you're going to all this trouble.

282
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:53,780
- I don't want to waste another minute.
- You say you got all your Is crossed

283
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,491
- and your Ts dotted?
- Sorry?

284
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,999


285
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:13,342


286
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,677


287
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,847


288
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,850


289
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,101


290
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,479


291
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,023


292
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,234


293
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,402


294
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,404


295
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,949


296
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,257
Hiro, what's wrong?

297
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,718
Nothing's wrong.
Not anymore.

298
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,262
You're acting like
you haven't seen me in forever.

299
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,307
- Come on. Let's go.
- Go where?

300
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,185
Anywhere, everywhere.

301
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,731
Pick a place.
Your trip around the world starts today.

302
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,610
- I don't have anything packed.
- We can buy clothes there.

303
00:19:15,862 --> 00:19:17,072
You're serious.

304
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:20,993
I don't want to spend
one more minute apart from you.

305
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:24,329
Come with me.
Right now.

306
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,874
Where are we going, Charlie?

307
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,465
Otsu, Japan.

308
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,844
It's where Takezo Kensei was born.

309
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,221


310
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,514


311
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,936
In the Shiga prefecture,
Otsu is a favorite destination

312
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,439
for relaxing on the beaches
of lake Biwa.

313
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,983
We can take nice long walks.

314
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,944
The average rainfall
in Otsu is 13 inches.

315
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,113
The average temperature is 10 °C.

316
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,449
The emperor Tenji built
the Omi Otsu palace in 672,

317
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:05,329
and the haiku writer Matsuo Basho
wrote that the city smelled like fish.

318
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:11,877
What was I saying?

319
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,171
You were on autopilot,
talking about Otsu.

320
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,132
Wait.

321
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,181
What's going on?

322
00:20:25,194 --> 00:20:26,194
Stuporous.

323
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:30,187
Decerebrate rigidity.
Vegetative disturbance.

324
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:32,271
I don't understand.

325
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:34,399
It's the aneurysm.

326
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:36,046
It's rupturing.

327
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:38,565
I'm dying, Hiro.

328
00:20:45,936 --> 00:20:47,079
Not yet, you're not.

329
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,461
<i>Your attention, please:</i>

330
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,075
<i>Local bus service
from Odessa to Lubbock,</i>

331
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:00,054
<i>Plainview, Amarillo and Dumas</i>

332
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:02,970
<i>will be leaving in five minutes.
Please have your tickets ready</i>.

333
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,898
You. Who are you?
I was just in a diner, And then...

334
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:17,999
What did you do to me?

335
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,736
What do you want?

336
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:22,865
You said you could fix things...
I need you to fix Charlie.

337
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,742
You told her you understand
how to fix things that are broken.

338
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:27,369
She's dying.

339
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:29,872
You're dying first.

340
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,554
You can't kill me, brain man.

341
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,728
I've something you want.

342
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,052
Yeah, your power.

343
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:10,530
- How are you able to do that?
- I'm the master of time and space.

344
00:22:11,008 --> 00:22:14,249
- But right now, I'm freezing time.
- Well, that must get tiring.

345
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:16,289
I can do this all day.

346
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:17,711
Can you?

347
00:22:24,346 --> 00:22:25,596
If you kill me,

348
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,807
you will never learn
what I know about the future.

349
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:31,934
Your future.

350
00:22:32,305 --> 00:22:33,305
Your life

351
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,853
and death.

352
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:38,023
Now I know you're lying.

353
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,361
I'm on my way to meet
a very special cheerleader.

354
00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:46,323
Then I'll be invincible.
Immortal.

355
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,824
Are you sure about that?

356
00:22:50,747 --> 00:22:52,287
I will tell you everything I know.

357
00:22:53,011 --> 00:22:55,040
If you help me save Charlie.

358
00:22:56,445 --> 00:22:58,460
You're dying too, aren't you?

359
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:01,181
A tumor, huh?
Well.

360
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,184
How is she?

361
00:23:14,544 --> 00:23:16,228
Not well.
Who's he?

362
00:23:16,935 --> 00:23:18,105
He's a doctor.

363
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:21,719
I'm a doctor.

364
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,277
We'll help her, I swear.

365
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,422
You can help her, right?

366
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:34,329
You saw her aneurysm.
You can take it out.

367
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,629
No problem.

368
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:38,527
It's like balling a melon.

369
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,961
I usually prefer
a more invasive style.

370
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,421
She dies, you die.

371
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:48,468
If it's my time...
I'm okay with that.

372
00:23:49,656 --> 00:23:52,264
- Really, you don't have to do this.
- No.

373
00:23:52,987 --> 00:23:54,937
We are meant to be together.

374
00:23:56,142 --> 00:23:57,542
Whatever it takes.

375
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,564
You might want to stay still
for this.

376
00:24:04,153 --> 00:24:04,818


377
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:06,403


378
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,322


379
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:11,115


380
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,701


381
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:16,746


382
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,371


383
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,087


384
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,372


385
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,509


386
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:31,920


387
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,389


388
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,416


389
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,428


390
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:47,226


391
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,888


392
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,620
I'm fine.
I'm fine, he did it.

393
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,754
<i>Five, six, seven, eight.</i>

394
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:10,216
<i>We are the Wildcats.
We're here to say hello,</i>

395
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:13,720
<i>to our friends, the Roughnecks,
from San Antonio.</i>

396
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:17,390
<i>We're psyched and we're ready
to come out on top.</i>

397
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:21,144
<i>Don't even try to fight it,
because we can't be stopped.</i>

398
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,147
<i>Now we say in closing,
the best of luck to you.</i>

399
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,901
<i>The Wildcats are number one,
and we'll prove it too!</i>

400
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,196
Everything okay?

401
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,990
Can't a father see
his daughter cheer at homecoming?

402
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,576
- You never see me cheer.
- I know.

403
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:38,995
I hate that I might
miss homecoming tomorrow.

404
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,751
I was supposed to grab
a bite to eat with the girls, but...

405
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,922
I don't know,
we could hang if you want.

406
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:52,342
I would love to hang.

407
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,054
So everything's okay at work?

408
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,807
Yeah.
Why would something be wrong?

409
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,643
I mean, do you like it?

410
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,062
Do you love it, selling paper?

411
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,232
I like it a lot.

412
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,693
I just... I'm sorry,

413
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,446
I can't imagine you
being in high school, and saying,

414
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,657
"when I grow up
I want to sell paper."

415
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:18,869
Well, no, not exactly.

416
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,870
What did you want to do?

417
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,290
Tell me.

418
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,625
Please.

419
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,380
I wanted to teach.

420
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,341
High school English, Shakespeare.

421
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,552
What do you know about Shakespeare?

422
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:40,682
"Now, fair hippolyta, our
nuptial hour draws on apace;

423
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,934
"four happy days bring in
another moon:

424
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,729
"but, o, methinks, how slow
this old moon wanes!

425
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,732
She lingers my desires..."

426
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,400
Something.

427
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,781
- What is that, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>?
- <i>A midsummer night's dream.</i>

428
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,451
It's about falling
in and out of love.

429
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,454
You're a drama geek.

430
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,584
I think you should do it.

431
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,754
You should teach.
Wait till I graduate, but you should.

432
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,381
It won't happen.

433
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,092
I just think you should do
what makes you happy.

434
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,554
I am.

435
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,055
Happy.

436
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,850
Claire, we're leaving.
Come on!

437
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,688
You go.
I'll see you later.

438
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,440
- Love you.
- Love you back.

439
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:51,377
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm telling you, I feel fine.

440
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,588
You're right.

441
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,131
These are incredible.

442
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,718
Sorry to interrupt this hallmark moment.
We had a deal.

443
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,136
You tell me everything.

444
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,144
I will tell you how you die.

445
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,483
You die alone.
I'm sorry.

446
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:18,238
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You will collect a lot of powers.

447
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,073
You will kill many people.

448
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,742
You will become strong.
The strongest of them all.

449
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,037
But in the end,
it won't make any difference.

450
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,419
We all gather to stop you.

451
00:28:34,128 --> 00:28:35,129
You're alone.

452
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,715
No one will mourn you.

453
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,635
No one will shed a tear.

454
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,345
No one.

455
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,683
I wish I could change fate,

456
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,394
But you must go on your path.

457
00:29:06,452 --> 00:29:08,454
<i>Five, six, seven, eight.</i>

458
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:12,083
<i>We are the Wildcats,
we're here to say hello,</i>

459
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,378
<i>to our friends, the roughnecks
from San Antonio.</i>

460
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,173
<i>We're psyched and we're ready
to come out...</i>

461
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,604
I would love one of those.

462
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,786
- I'm glad you came.
- I can't do this.

463
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,497
I just don't think it's smart
for either one of us.

464
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:54,834
- Workplace romances never are.
- Please don't do that.

465
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,253
- Do what?
- Blame it on the job. Come on.

466
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,715
You do that with
Sandra and Claire, not me.

467
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,176
You know how complicated
it can be, you know...

468
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,785
I know, I've been to
the human resources training.

469
00:30:05,952 --> 00:30:06,971
I mean, come on.

470
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,600
That is not this.

471
00:30:13,723 --> 00:30:16,274
This isn't, "let's go have sex
in the supply closet

472
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,730
because we're bored
with our lives" thing.

473
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,640
You care about me.

474
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,062
Yes, I do.

475
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,677
We are such good liars.
We've convinced ourselves

476
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,576
that everything is okay,
but it is not okay.

477
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:52,245
Taking the long way home, you know.

478
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,942
Having that extra beer with dinner.

479
00:30:58,218 --> 00:31:00,268
Don't you want to be yourself?

480
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,155
Don't we deserve
a little bit of happiness?

481
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,610
I love my family.

482
00:31:17,134 --> 00:31:18,134
And...

483
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,159
as complicated as it is,

484
00:31:20,326 --> 00:31:22,784
as much as I... lie to them,

485
00:31:24,528 --> 00:31:25,928
I still love them.

486
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:28,932
And...

487
00:31:29,382 --> 00:31:32,610
maybe one day I can tell them the truth.
I just don't want to destroy that...

488
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:33,877
possibility.

489
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,020
And that... is the truth.

490
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:43,691
I know.

491
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:47,431
You're a great agent.

492
00:31:48,476 --> 00:31:50,408
I can bag and tag
with the best of them.

493
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,456
I'm a regular rodeo queen.

494
00:31:56,023 --> 00:31:57,473
I need you, Lauren.

495
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:03,046
I need your help with this Sylar mess.
I need your help with Claire.

496
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:09,344
Of course.

497
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:14,655
Of course.

498
00:32:17,432 --> 00:32:19,646
And I will always be there
to help you, Noah.

499
00:32:22,905 --> 00:32:24,555
Let's get back to work.

500
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,536


501
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:38,289


502
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,991


503
00:32:42,358 --> 00:32:44,027


504
00:32:44,051 --> 00:32:45,199


505
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:46,551


506
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,599


507
00:32:57,127 --> 00:32:58,277
What's wrong?

508
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:00,398
I don't know...

509
00:33:01,524 --> 00:33:03,195
I kind of have a knot in my gut.

510
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:04,315
Oh, then...

511
00:33:05,046 --> 00:33:06,401
Allow me to untie it.

512
00:33:06,924 --> 00:33:09,124
You're the one that put it there.

513
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,919
Look, Hiro, I was okay with dying,

514
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:15,848
Really, I'd accepted that, but this...
Gosh, this just feels like cheating.

515
00:33:16,015 --> 00:33:17,912
- No, it's okay.
- It's not.

516
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,354
It's not okay.
I mean, that man, Sylar.

517
00:33:20,521 --> 00:33:22,261
He's going to kill a lot of people.

518
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:24,544
I don't understand
how you could let him do that.

519
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,908
You're supposed to be
one of the good guys.

520
00:33:28,517 --> 00:33:31,092
I had to preserve
the time-space continuum.

521
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,608
But you didn't.

522
00:33:32,775 --> 00:33:35,179
You changed it.
You saved me.

523
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:39,232
But this is our happily-ever-after.

524
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:41,499
We're going to Otsu.
Yay! Otsu!

525
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,608
300,000 people die every single day.

526
00:33:45,344 --> 00:33:48,314
Young, old.
There are accidents, murders.

527
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:50,131
Why am I any different?

528
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:51,863
Why do I get to live?

529
00:33:55,122 --> 00:33:56,572
Because I love you.

530
00:33:57,225 --> 00:33:58,975
Then that's just selfish.

531
00:34:15,902 --> 00:34:18,381
Excuse me.
I found this on my desk.

532
00:34:18,548 --> 00:34:20,894
I guess somebody
delivered it by mistake.

533
00:34:28,953 --> 00:34:31,152
You planning a sting
at the midland motel?

534
00:34:42,461 --> 00:34:43,461
So...

535
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,551
we're pretending that we've never been
to the burnt toast diner?

536
00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:58,179
Everything okay, Bennet?

537
00:35:13,034 --> 00:35:14,527
It's my mistake....

538
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,380
thought I saw you there.

539
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:22,745
- Have a good night.
- You too.

540
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,027
Beer, please.
Root.

541
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,251


542
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,463


543
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,342


544
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,721


545
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:25,141


546
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:32,021


547
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:33,899


548
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,319
"The course of true love
never did run smooth."

549
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,655


550
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:47,413


551
00:37:02,057 --> 00:37:03,805
I was just so terrible to you.

552
00:37:04,254 --> 00:37:06,557
After everything you did,
risking your life.

553
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,810
You must think
something awful of me.

554
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,170
Never.

555
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,522
I understand what you think.

556
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,633
That I was selfish.

557
00:37:17,655 --> 00:37:19,737
Maybe I was.
But I'm not.

558
00:37:20,214 --> 00:37:22,532
I know the world is
a better place with you in it.

559
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,608
Thank you.

560
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:29,163
Thank you for saving my life.

561
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:31,502
Shucks, ma'am.

562
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,376
No trouble.

563
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,991
Were you crying?

564
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,916
It's folding paper.

565
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,263
I was trying to make
a thousand origami cranes.

566
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,475


567
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,354


568
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:56,357


569
00:38:07,993 --> 00:38:11,080


570
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,041


571
00:38:27,668 --> 00:38:28,857
Here, Charlie.

572
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,380
Butterfly man.
What's going on?

573
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,400
I've done something very bad, Hiro.

574
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,861
What do you mean?

575
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:44,071
I've taken Charlie.

576
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:45,569
I had to.

577
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:47,952
Had to what?

578
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:51,766
Where?
Where have you taken her?

579
00:38:52,149 --> 00:38:53,414
Back to my carnival.

580
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,002
Rather, forward to our present.

581
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:01,342
Why?

582
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,424
Why would you do that?

583
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:05,818
To get to you.

584
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:08,095
It's all been about you, Hiro.

585
00:39:11,056 --> 00:39:12,554
Take me to her.

586
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,061
Where is she?
Where is Charlie?

587
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,292
You'll have
to dig deep and take control.

588
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:20,441
You'll have to take us back,
if you ever want to see her again.

589
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:24,777


590
00:39:26,268 --> 00:39:28,366
You did it.
You're gaining control back.

591
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,826
That's great.


592
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:33,955
She's not exactly here.

593
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:52,473
Have you seen Charlie?

594
00:39:52,997 --> 00:39:54,516
Where is Charlie?

595
00:40:18,553 --> 00:40:20,057
His name was Arnold.

596
00:40:20,975 --> 00:40:23,623
He was a time traveler,
just like you.

597
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,666
His body couldn't take the strain.

598
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,387
He had a tumor, just like you.

599
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,741
The last thing I asked him to do
was to take your Charlie

600
00:40:36,908 --> 00:40:37,965
and trap her...

601
00:40:39,257 --> 00:40:40,473
somewhere in time.

602
00:40:41,704 --> 00:40:42,704
It killed him.

603
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,197
You're a murderer.

604
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,995
Tell me where Charlie is.

605
00:40:58,177 --> 00:41:01,292
If I told you, there would
be nothing to keep you here.

606
00:41:03,543 --> 00:41:04,913
You manipulated me.

607
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:08,674
- This whole time.
- You left me no choice.

608
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:12,131
You've got too much of...
What do you call that? <i>Giri</i>? Honor.

609
00:41:12,298 --> 00:41:14,471
I respect that.
I respect you, but...

610
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:18,346
I had to do something

611
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:20,436
to get you to work for me.

612
00:41:21,603 --> 00:41:23,147
To fix my past.

613
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,617
But why me?

614
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,901
If you had a time traveler...

615
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,909
If anyone here found out
about my transgressions,

616
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:40,289
all the good work I've done
would unravel.

617
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,317
You are not butterfly man.

618
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:45,920
You are evil butterfly man.

619
00:41:54,216 --> 00:41:57,223
I am the only one who knows exactly

620
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,041
where your sweet Charlie is.

621
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,098
And you can save her,
but only if you do exactly

622
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:04,825
what I ask you to do.

623
00:42:07,256 --> 00:42:09,735
I got my own butterflies
that need crushing.

624
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:21,163
What must I do?

625
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,572
I made a mistake

626
00:42:27,435 --> 00:42:29,350
About eight weeks ago.

627
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,389
Sorry.

628
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:41,034
So sorry.

629
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:53,654
