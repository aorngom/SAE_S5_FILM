1
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,660
you don't realize
how valued you are

2
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,660
here at the company.

3
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,200
you're part
of the family now.

4
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,000
(mohinder)
i'm in over my head.

5
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,630
as long as i'm alive,
you will be taken care of.

6
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,800
(caitlin)
peter!

7
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,660
this here's everything you had
on you when we found you.

8
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,630
your box or your life.

9
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,260
 <i>you gonna open it,</i>
 <i>or what?</i>

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,660
hiro nakamura, murdered.
angela petrelli, attacked.

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,830
this is my dad.
he may be the killer.

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,960
i'll find your father.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,860
molly,
what's the apartment number?

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,900
nine.
nine. good girl.

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,260
get out of there
right now.
he sees me.

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,560
get out of there.
leave me alone! aah!

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,500
molly, please wake up.

18
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,300
(mohinder)
when confronted
by our worst nightmares,

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,760
the choices are few:

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,460
fight or flight.

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,660
we hope to find the strength
to stand against our fears.

22
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,400
but sometimes,
despite ourselves,

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,860
we run.

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,900
what if the nightmare
gives chase?

25
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,500
where can we hide then?

26
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,730
 <i>(parkman)</i>
 <i>okay, when's she gonna wake up?</i>

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,530
i don't know,
she's burning up.

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,930
all right, we gotta get her
to a hospital.

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,000
no hospital's equipped
to deal with this.

30
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,230
you really think my father
did this to her...

31
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,630
in her nightmare?

32
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,930
she used her ability
to find him for you,

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,100
and slipped into this.

34
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,160
she was so afraid.

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,130
i never should have asked her
to look for him.

36
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,100
no, you shouldn't have.

37
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,700
but now you know
where he is.

38
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,800
i can't just leave her
like this.

39
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,830
you have to.

40
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,000
if your father
did something to her,

41
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,460
you need to find out what
and how to end it.

42
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,960
you have an address
in philadelphia.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,730
she even saw his door.

44
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,460
i haven't seen the man
in 25 years.

45
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,060
molly faced her worst nightmare
for you.

46
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,860
do the same for her.
find him.

47
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,660
i'll stay here with her.
i'll do everything i can.

48
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,700
i don't even know
what i'm dealing with.

49
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:15,260
why was he in that photo?

50
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,830
angela petrelli...

51
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,930
she knows him.

52
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,130
you're gonna be okay.

53
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,530
i promise.

54
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,300
i was about to lock up
when this guy showed up.

55
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,460
he--he pushed his way in,
shoved a gun in my face.

56
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,160
next thing i know
he's flying through that glass.

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,000
you hit an armed man?

58
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,500
i guess.
could've been a kick.

59
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,800
i don't know,
it all happened so fast.

60
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,830
is this the guy?

61
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,830
his name is lonny stills.
he's a local gangbanger.

62
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,700
he's already hit three other
fast food joints

63
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,730
 <i>in the area this month.</i>

64
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,960
it fits his m.o.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,900
like i said,
it's all a blur.

66
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,160
look, i know you don't want
to be a snitch.

67
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,500
it's dangerous.

68
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,260
but in order for me
to get this guy off the street,

69
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,130
i need somebody
to step up and i.d. him.

70
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,300
be a hero.

71
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,130
i'm sorry, i can't do that.

72
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,230
you know,
i can't help a neighborhood

73
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,460
that won't help itself.

74
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,760
 <i>you change your mind,</i>

75
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,600
you give me a call.

76
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,800
(peter)
you closing up already?

77
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,660
it's the middle
of the afternoon.

78
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,400
i need a break.

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,530
i could get used
to this.

80
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,400
right, a guy who can
throw 1,000 volts

81
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,900
our of either hand...

82
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,630
settlingor everyday life
in a pub in cork.

83
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,030
i'm not sure it suits you.

84
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,860
why not?

85
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,460
peter, just because you don't
remember your past,

86
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,100
it doesn't mean
you don't have one.

87
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,630
aren you curious about
who you are,

88
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,830
or where you come from?

89
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,830
you've seen what i can do.

90
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,430
there's a side of me
that i can't control.

91
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,800
maybe it's best
if i don't dig too deep.

92
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,760
i know the kind of man
you are.

93
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,830
even if you don't.

94
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,260
there's only good in you.

95
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,260
and i bet whatever's
in that box

96
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,460
will tell you
the same thing.

97
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,130
weren't you the one
who didn't want me to look

98
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,430
in that box?

99
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,700
i only said that because
you hadn't kissed me yet.

100
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,360
now that you have,
you done with me?

101
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,500
mm...gettin' there.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,860
after all,
a pretty boy like you,

103
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,800
there's bound to be someone
looking for you.

104
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,360
friends.
a girlfriend.

105
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,100
let 'em look.

106
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,460
like i told you,

107
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,260
you're not gonna find him
in there.

108
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,660
but you're sure
it was him?

109
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,060
yeah.

110
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,360
found him cuffed inside there
a few nights back.

111
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,460
poor sap.

112
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,000
didn't know
how he got there.

113
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,600
didn't even know
his own name.

114
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,200
do you know where
he is now?

115
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,660
depends.
who's askin'?

116
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,900
just me.

117
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,260
i work for a company
interested in keeping him

118
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,860
out of trouble.

119
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,300
peter is a...
dangerous guy.

120
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,930
ha. you don't have
to tell me that.

121
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,330
he's in town.

122
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,900
place called
wandering rocks pub.

123
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,000
hey, if he's so dangerous,
sweetheart,

124
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,630
why'd they send a little girl
like you in all alone?

125
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,830
i can take care
of myself.

126
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,400
bring her back
to holding.

127
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,460
what do you think
you're doing

128
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,860
interrogating my mother
without me there?

129
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,830
relax.

130
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,960
she didn't give me
anything.

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
of course she didn't give you
anything.

132
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,500
these people protect
each other.

133
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,560
my mother's not a killer.

134
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,930
i'm not gonna have her sit
in jail

135
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,000
for a crime
she didn't commit.

136
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,060
neither am i.

137
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,000
that's why i'm going
to philadelphia

138
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,660
to see my father,
figure this whole thing out.

139
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,960
 <i>let me come with you.</i>
no! you're not a cop.

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,700
listen, i'm guessing this isn't
official police business.

141
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,860
so if i'm there, it won't
really make a difference.

142
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,530
because officially,
neither are you.

143
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,400
you don't understand.
it's molly.

144
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,900
my father did something to her.
she's in trouble.

145
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,930
what do you mean
"did something to her"?

146
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,130
come here.

147
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,430
did what?

148
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,900
he got inside her head
somehow.

149
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,060
i don't know how he did it,
but i think it's all connected.

150
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,360
to kaito.
to your mother.

151
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,030
it could be dangerous.

152
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,030
i can take care of myself.

153
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,860
listen,

154
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,230
i have to do this.

155
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,560
let me come with you.

156
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,300
fine.

157
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,560
we can probably
get therfaster.

158
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,300
you know,
'cause you can, uh...

159
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,400
i'm not a cargo jet,
parkman.

160
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,060
oh, please.

161
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,660
i need to talk to him.

162
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,530
alone.

163
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,130
tell him what you told me.

164
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,330
 <i>this american girl...</i>

165
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,200
she's hitting all the boys
on the dock,

166
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,800
looking for a certain
shipping container.

167
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,200
she say what she wanted?
yeah.

168
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,360
you.

169
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,460
no worries, boyo.

170
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,830
i think i can help.

171
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,300
this is my problem.

172
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:16,360
not given what i just saw
between you and my sister.

173
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,130
you care about her,
don't you?

174
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,830
right now, she's
the only thing in my life

175
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,960
 <i>that means something.</i>

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,030
caitlin has a flat
up the hill.

177
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,730
go there and stay

209
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,900

what's happening.

210
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,800
