1
00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:06,722
<i>People think I collect art,</i>

2
00:00:07,594 --> 00:00:10,611
<i>but I really collect
our lives fixed in paint.</i>

3
00:00:11,744 --> 00:00:15,171
<i>A perfect moment
capturing an entire existence,</i>

4
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:17,016
<i>made immortal.</i>

5
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:19,568
What you've done is not evolution,
it's murder.

6
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:20,781
What I am doing...

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,855
is revenge.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,802
<i>A monster's fight to survive...</i>

9
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:29,055
<i>and live to kill again.</i>

10
00:00:32,794 --> 00:00:36,453
<i>A mother willing to fracture
her own soul to protect her child.</i>

11
00:00:36,743 --> 00:00:38,177
Don't lie to me anymore.

12
00:00:38,357 --> 00:00:40,986
You told me she was gone.
Now which one of you is in control?

13
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:42,903
Niki, Jessica?

14
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:44,482
I'm not so sure.

15
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:48,865
<i>Youth struggle for innocence,
despite life's cruelty.</i>

16
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:50,526
Who are you?

17
00:00:50,962 --> 00:00:52,146
I'm your grandmother.

18
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,207
<i>The double-edged lies
needed to sustain a double-edged life.</i>

19
00:00:56,543 --> 00:00:58,564
He is going to be a problem.

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,928
Why don't we do it right now?

21
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:03,797
Sorry.

22
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:05,923
- What do we think?
- He's telling the truth.

23
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:07,628
He doesn't know where Claire is.

24
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:10,773
<i>A wandering hero's pure joy at success.</i>

25
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:20,422
<i>And his darkest hour,</i>

26
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,660
<i>when all the world seems lost.</i>

27
00:01:23,949 --> 00:01:26,733
<i>All perfect moments frozen in time.</i>

28
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:30,286
<i>Alone, each tells a single story.</i>

29
00:01:30,695 --> 00:01:33,183
<i>Together they can tell the future.</i>

30
00:01:42,873 --> 00:01:44,149
Daddy, I'm so sorry.

31
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:46,500
It's all my fault.

32
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,021
I tried to do what you said,
but they caught me, and now...

33
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,679
I'm so scared.

34
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:57,045
What is it?

35
00:01:57,983 --> 00:01:58,983
You.

36
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:01,111
You're not...

37
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:02,858
Not what?

38
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:04,481
Not you.

39
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,575
Why don't you leave us alone, Candice?

40
00:02:15,443 --> 00:02:16,481
Are you sure?

41
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:20,328
I can show him things
that would make him tear his eyes out.

42
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:23,208
You've got more important matters
to take care of.

43
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,341
Things okay in here?

44
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:35,347
Do you need anything?

45
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:38,329
I just got through
with this Graham Greene I was reading.

46
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:39,483
I'll bring it.

47
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:41,169
How was it?

48
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:43,313
Ended bad.

49
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:46,628
I don't know where Claire is.

50
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,154
None of these games can make me
tell you what I don't know.

51
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:52,014
I'm going easy on you.

52
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:54,528
The only reason we haven't...

53
00:02:55,617 --> 00:03:00,473
taken it up a notch, is...
because of friendship.

54
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:03,044
Friendship?

55
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:04,999
I brought you in, vouched for you.

56
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,991
And how do you repay my kindness?

57
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:09,342
Attempting to destroy the company?

58
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:11,659
You asked me to betray my daughter.

59
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,997
You got too close.

60
00:03:13,463 --> 00:03:14,939
And then you got sloppy.

61
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,230
I saw what your girl Candice can do.

62
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,324
Maybe you're the one who got sloppy.

63
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:23,457
Maybe I'm exactly where I want to be.

64
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:25,617
You're on death row.

65
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:28,221
If you were gonna kill me,
you'd have done it by now.

66
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:29,782
I'm just waiting for the order.

67
00:03:30,356 --> 00:03:31,744
That's how we do it here.

68
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:33,940
We follow orders.

69
00:03:40,483 --> 00:03:42,290
I'll see about getting you that book.

70
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:50,222
Japanese feudalism.

71
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:52,486
Renaissance, Baroque,

72
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:55,064
Mayan, Persian.

73
00:03:56,418 --> 00:03:57,418
20th century.

74
00:03:58,054 --> 00:04:00,026
You must bring
all your first dates here?

75
00:04:01,605 --> 00:04:02,925
What do you do with all this?

76
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:04,044
I protect it.

77
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:07,949
I shield it from a greedy
and dangerous world.

78
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,962
You push the cultured facade
long enough,

79
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,567
people forget you're a criminal.

80
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:15,693
When my day of judgment comes, Nathan,

81
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:18,954
I'll be remembered as a humanitarian.

82
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:24,320
I care about the world.
I just want to save it.

83
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:25,917
To heal it.

84
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:29,553
And to do that, I need you.

85
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,599
What could you possibly know
about healing?

86
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:50,228
A few things.

87
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:08,048
Subtitles: swsub.com

88
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:17,206
<i>Parkman.</i>

89
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:20,883
<i>Parkman, wake up.</i>

90
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:27,689
<i>- They're just waiting...</i>
- You gotta be kidding me.

91
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:29,090
<i>They're coming for you.</i>

92
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:30,906
<i>They're just waiting for the order.</i>

93
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:38,846
<i>And then you're never coming back.</i>

94
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:41,275
<i>Not to your wife,
or anyone else you care about.</i>

95
00:05:41,403 --> 00:05:42,943
<i>They'll never see you again.</i>

96
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:46,974
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

97
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:48,433
<i>If you can hear me,</i>

98
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:51,069
<i>and if you can trust me,
bang on the pipe.</i>

99
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:00,249
<i>Good man.</i>

100
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,337
<i>If you follow everything I say,
you might not die.</i>

101
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:06,662
<i>You may want to argue,</i>

102
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:08,780
<i>but luckily
this is a one-way conversation.</i>

103
00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:10,311
<i>Can I count on you?</i>

104
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,499
I hate him.

105
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:13,102
<i>Yes or no?</i>

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I know this man.

107
00:06:20,436 --> 00:06:23,088
Well, great. If you see him,
tell him I want my sword back.

108
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:25,135
He said he needed it to save the world.

109
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:29,333
A lot of people
seem to be saying that these days.

110
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:30,497
Well...

111
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:34,705
we all have our roles to play
in the events to come.

112
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:42,891
You know,
this isn't just a collection of art.

113
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:46,924
This... is a road map.

114
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:51,800
These artists
envisioned a brighter future.

115
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:54,817
Peace, prosperity.

116
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,866
That's your idea of a brighter future?

117
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,292
What if I was to tell you that it was?

118
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:11,235
I'd say you were a lousy humanitarian.

119
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:16,890
I was a lot younger than you
when I discovered my power.

120
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:22,541
And there were others too, like me,
who discovered theirs.

121
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,821
We were all confused.

122
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:29,956
And we found each other.

123
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,444
Together,

124
00:07:34,513 --> 00:07:36,749
we tried to make a difference
to the world.

125
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:39,095
And for a while, we did.

126
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:41,313
It was beautiful.

127
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:45,103
And then, some of my...

128
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:47,373
friends...

129
00:07:49,374 --> 00:07:50,485
they lost their way.

130
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,930
They used their powers
for personal gain.

131
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,432
And all the good that we'd done was...

132
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:00,046
Well, it amounted to nothing.

133
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,888
And I learned

134
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:06,581
that healing one person at a time
was just not enough.

135
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:08,720
We needed something...

136
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,837
something to pull it down on course.

137
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:13,047
Something big.

138
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,356
And that's what you think this is?

139
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:17,986
People need hope, Nathan.

140
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:23,847
An explosion of that magnitude

141
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:26,788
would destroy half the population
of New York City like that.

142
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,421
There's six and a half billion people
on the planet.

143
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:32,708
That less than .07%.

144
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:35,177
Come on, that's an acceptable loss
by anyone's count.

145
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,752
- By anybody's count?
- Look,

146
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:41,041
I said people need hope,
but they trust fear.

147
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,373
This is crazy.

148
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:46,013
This tragedy will be a catalyst
for good.

149
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
For change.

150
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,404
Out of the ashes,

151
00:08:50,027 --> 00:08:52,789
humanity will find a common goal.

152
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:57,748
A united sense of hope
couched in a united sense of fear.

153
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,719
And it is your destiny, Nathan,

154
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,694
to be the leader
who uses this event to rally a city,

155
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:07,533
a nation, a world.

156
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:10,261
Now you look deep into your heart.

157
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:12,534
You'll know I'm right.

158
00:09:15,616 --> 00:09:17,113
I don't mean to toss a wet blanket,

159
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,236
but if you haven't noticed,
I'm down in the polls.

160
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:21,228
I'm not gonna get elected to Congress.

161
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:24,287
Let alone the White House.

162
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:35,203
Do you think I'd leave that to chance?

163
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:44,486
If you know all this,

164
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:46,164
then you also know

165
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:49,113
that the exploding man
is my brother Peter.

166
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:51,657
As I said,

167
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:53,892
we all have our role to play.

168
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:58,133
Peter's curtain call will come
the day after you're elected.

169
00:09:58,573 --> 00:09:59,716
You're insane.

170
00:10:01,763 --> 00:10:02,796
You know that?

171
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:13,810
<i>Now, all that banging
has alerted the guards.</i>

172
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:14,968
What?

173
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:18,583
You told me to signal you!

174
00:10:19,012 --> 00:10:20,288
<i>Don't worry, it's a good thing.</i>

175
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:21,955
<i>Now look for the rusted pipe.</i>

176
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:23,411
Pipes.

177
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,174
<i>It should be the one
closest to the window.</i>

178
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,118
<i>A couple of hits will loosen it.</i>

179
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:29,666
<i>Hurry up! A guard will be there.</i>

180
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:31,155
<i>You've got three minutes.</i>

181
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:42,338
Come on!

182
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:48,175
<i>By now you should have removed the pipe.</i>

183
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:50,719
<i>The guard will be coming
through the door any second now.</i>

184
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:52,627
<i>Signal when you've knocked him out.</i>

185
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:54,557
Yeah, I'm working on it.

186
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,952
Come on!

187
00:11:10,148 --> 00:11:11,814
<i>Grab his pass, and head into the hall.</i>

188
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:17,571
Suresh?

189
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,149
It's Peter Petrelli.

190
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:33,743
Mohinder?

191
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:53,553
Sylar.

192
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:57,681
I remember you.

193
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:01,991
You're like me, aren't you?

194
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:06,691
I'd like to see how that works.

195
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:38,318
Not now.

196
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:40,454
I'm not done with him yet.

197
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:48,184
Interesting.
I can't wait to try that one.

198
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:39,959
My God.

199
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:51,130
My two boys actually getting along.

200
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,870
Nathan's wedding.

201
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:54,874
He has two boys of his own now.

202
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,540
And that handsome man is Peter.

203
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,464
But you've already met him now,
haven't you?

204
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:03,133
He saved my life.

205
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:05,639
He forgot to mention
that we were related.

206
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:07,047
Oh, he didn't know.

207
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:09,411
He didn't even know you existed.

208
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:17,307
But you did?

209
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:19,153
Since you were a baby.

210
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:21,997
Nathan's folly in Texas.

211
00:14:22,617 --> 00:14:23,933
And you kept me a secret?

212
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:27,085
I cared about you a great deal.

213
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:29,428
Perhaps not in the traditional sense...

214
00:14:29,532 --> 00:14:31,365
oatmeal cookies and school plays...

215
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:32,643
but I did what I could.

216
00:14:33,617 --> 00:14:35,542
My husband and I
made arrangements for you.

217
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:36,803
Arrangements?

218
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,966
Then that fire happened, and...

219
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:42,910
Nathan just assumed you were gone, so...

220
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:44,056
So you let him.

221
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:46,005
It was the right thing to do.

222
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:47,884
You need to be protected.

223
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:51,493
Trust me, I don't need protecting.

224
00:14:51,846 --> 00:14:55,009
Because you can grow back your bones
and spit up bullets?

225
00:14:55,804 --> 00:14:57,700
You have no idea, Claire.

226
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:00,891
The life your abilities
would bring you...

227
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:03,672
You deserve better.

228
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:05,719
And that's why you have to go.

229
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:07,911
Get you away, like we planned.

230
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,011
I haven't seen Peter,
or met my father yet.

231
00:15:12,107 --> 00:15:14,980
Neither of them is in a position
to be anything to you right now.

232
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:17,248
Be sensible.

233
00:15:17,824 --> 00:15:19,424
By shipping me off to Paris?

234
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:21,238
For now, yes.

235
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,337
I'll be taking you there myself.

236
00:15:23,868 --> 00:15:25,677
You'll have a chance to grow up
and develop

237
00:15:25,678 --> 00:15:27,481
into someone
who can make her own choices.

238
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:32,126
And then if you choose to come back
and join this madness, like I once did,

239
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:36,044
at least
I will have given you the option.

240
00:15:37,994 --> 00:15:38,994
So you're like me?

241
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:48,641
I regret a lot of the choices
I've made in my life.

242
00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:51,933
You're getting the benefit
of my experience.

243
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:56,137
Whether I want it or not.

244
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,661
You get that mouth from me.

245
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:19,801
The list... no!

246
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,295
My editor needs these pages right away,

247
00:16:32,678 --> 00:16:34,228
so I called my best messenger.

248
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:36,163
Oh, man, the new 9th Wonders.

249
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:38,589
I've been dying to find out
what happens to Hiro.

250
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:41,304
The latest, and the last.

251
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:43,757
Last?

252
00:16:44,465 --> 00:16:45,478
Looks that way.

253
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:47,681
Why, what do you mean?

254
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:49,929
Never mind.

255
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,714
So what happens to Hiro in this one?

256
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:56,011
You promise you won't post any spoilers?

257
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:00,092
The future?

258
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,561
How do you come up with this stuff?

259
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:04,529
It's a gift.

260
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:06,284
Speaking of which...

261
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:13,810
Your sketchbook?

262
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,180
Are you serious?

263
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:17,556
Hold on to it.

264
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,494
It might be worth something someday.

265
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:23,184
Thank you.

266
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:38,618
Working for a gangster like Linderman,
pulling triggers for him.

267
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:40,372
Everything I've done,
I've done for Micah.

268
00:17:40,422 --> 00:17:41,878
You keep telling yourself that.

269
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:45,195
Hey, if it wasn't for me,
Niki would still be in prison,

270
00:17:45,249 --> 00:17:47,833
Micah wouldn't have a mother,
and you'd be all alone.

271
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,950
I don't remember you complaining.

272
00:17:51,997 --> 00:17:54,573
Niki, Jessica,
whoever the hell you are, I'm done.

273
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:57,443
- I'm taking Micah, and...
- Careful how you finish that sentence.

274
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,091
He's not safe as long as Linderman
owns our lives.

275
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:03,188
Not as long as you're around.
Look at what you brought into our house.

276
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:04,612
What, money?

277
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:06,429
Rent?

278
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:08,048
Poor me!

279
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:10,989
Nobody wants to hire a black ex-con.

280
00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:14,044
Everywhere you go, people die.

281
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:16,251
Cash, cars,
hurting people for the fun of it.

282
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:17,949
Hell, you didn't turn into Jessica.

283
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:20,240
You turned into your old man.

284
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:22,289
Don't you dare.

285
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:25,415
I'll die before I'll let you do to Micah
what he did to you.

286
00:18:25,556 --> 00:18:26,568
Miss Sanders...

287
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,577
Mr. Linderman has asked to see you
right away.

288
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:34,387
If this is the life you want,

289
00:18:35,503 --> 00:18:36,855
you need to get Micah out of it.

290
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:41,150
You can say good-bye tonight.

291
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:49,311
<i>The first door on the right
is the supply room.</i>

292
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:52,856
<i>Steal something less conspicuous.</i>

293
00:18:56,826 --> 00:18:57,902
<i>Keep moving.</i>

294
00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:00,114
<i>You'll see an exit door before the hall.</i>

295
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:02,426
Orders came down.

296
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:04,954
We're moving Bennet,
Sprague, and Parkman.

297
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:07,984
Now make sure you gas Sprague's room
before you put the IV in him.

298
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:10,490
I don't want that man
so much as dreaming.

299
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,870
What about Parkman?

300
00:19:12,011 --> 00:19:13,414
Put some tape on his mouth.

301
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:16,105
I don't want to hear any more
about his pregnant wife.

302
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,392
You want to do what?!

303
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,424
We gotta go.

304
00:19:35,902 --> 00:19:36,916
Quickly!

305
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,477
Go... how did you even get in here?

306
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,211
Bennet, he's got a plan.

307
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:41,516
Bennet?

308
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:43,385
Were you listening to him?

309
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:45,224
He told me to come get you.

310
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:47,550
He could be leading you
right where he wants you to go.

311
00:19:47,612 --> 00:19:49,445
It can't be worse than the alternative.

312
00:20:08,443 --> 00:20:09,498
Mrs. Petrelli?

313
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,690
Yes.

314
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:14,021
I'm so sorry. It's Peter.

315
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:16,565
What about him?

316
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:19,388
I found this address in his wallet.

317
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:22,295
I didn't know where else to go.
I couldn't leave him.

318
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:24,717
He's dead.

319
00:20:27,218 --> 00:20:29,218
He was killed... murdered...

320
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,306
trying to save my life.

321
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:35,986
I was in over my head and...

322
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,279
Get out of here.

323
00:20:39,928 --> 00:20:40,951
I'm sorry?

324
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:45,598
Please leave... now.

325
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:24,378
Mr. Linderman will see you now.

326
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:25,850
Linderman? You're kidding.

327
00:21:27,064 --> 00:21:28,576
Linderman doesn't see anyone.

328
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:30,604
Not if I can help it.

329
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:33,788
Fearsome Jessica, finally.

330
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:35,627
Sweet Niki, yes,

331
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:38,416
but you... I never had the pleasure.

332
00:21:39,754 --> 00:21:40,765
You were due.

333
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,054
We've both certainly
come a long way, haven't we,

334
00:21:44,185 --> 00:21:46,864
since you borrowed that $30,000

335
00:21:47,613 --> 00:21:49,289
and conveniently forgot to repay.

336
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,729
Oh, by the way...

337
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:54,402
I've had to have that room repainted
since your last assignment.

338
00:21:56,462 --> 00:21:57,538
What is this?

339
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,165
I need a small favor.

340
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:02,618
You're Linderman.

341
00:22:02,937 --> 00:22:04,917
When you need something,
you send your boys.

342
00:22:05,063 --> 00:22:07,073
When it's something big,
you send lawyers.

343
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:09,049
This must be off the charts.

344
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:10,883
It's all a matter of perspective.

345
00:22:12,073 --> 00:22:14,372
I need to borrow your Micah briefly.

346
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:15,752
Borrow?

347
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:17,995
Yeah, that is, his talent.

348
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:22,623
I want to help Micah achieve
something monumental in his life.

349
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:24,894
I had a plan in place

350
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:27,201
that, until recently, began to unravel.

351
00:22:27,497 --> 00:22:29,705
I need your son to help me repair it.

352
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:31,602
Micah wasn't part of our deal.

353
00:22:32,414 --> 00:22:34,154
I don't want him involved in all this.

354
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,310
Understand,

355
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,180
Micah is involved
by the mere fact of his birth.

356
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:42,297
Now, I've been,
I think, more than fair to you.

357
00:22:42,438 --> 00:22:44,269
I mean,
I helped you out of a tough spot.

358
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,342
Spared you that long walk
to the gas chamber even.

359
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:48,984
So...

360
00:22:49,258 --> 00:22:51,785
a chocolate milk,
all the cookies he can eat,

361
00:22:52,048 --> 00:22:53,329
and I'll tell you what.

362
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:56,751
I'll even make him
a fresh sandwich myself.

363
00:22:57,575 --> 00:23:00,580
If you need something from me,
point and I'll shoot.

364
00:23:02,145 --> 00:23:03,305
Micah's off limits.

365
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:07,406
The request was a courtesy, dear.

366
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:11,359
Send anyone you want...

367
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:14,592
you're not touching my son.

368
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:23,278
We'd better take out
an insurance policy on Miss Sanders.

369
00:23:30,724 --> 00:23:31,768
The power grid!

370
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:33,524
Why does he want me to do, melt it?

371
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,178
No, no, he says you've gotta...

372
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:38,653
- What the hell's an E.M.P.?
- I don't know!

373
00:23:38,953 --> 00:23:40,313
<i>It's an electromagnetic pulse</i>

374
00:23:40,366 --> 00:23:43,055
<i>that causes a high-intensity
photoelectron surge.</i>

375
00:23:43,895 --> 00:23:46,849
I don't know what he's saying,
but he says it's not radioactive!

376
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,335
- He says it's clean.
- But I don't know how to do that!

377
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:50,798
He said you'd say that. He says...

378
00:23:50,893 --> 00:23:53,007
You have no concept of your potential!

379
00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:55,584
You can focus all your energy
into one burst.

380
00:23:56,006 --> 00:23:59,196
He says don't burn hot, burn bright.
Does that make sense?

381
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,723
Did he say anything else?

382
00:24:02,611 --> 00:24:04,140
I shouldn't stand next to you.

383
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:27,090
The power's out, let's go!

384
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:30,389
- No. We've gotta get Bennet.
- That guy is why we're in here!

385
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:31,681
He got us this far, we owe him.

386
00:24:31,745 --> 00:24:34,170
- I'm not going back in there.
- They'll kill him!

387
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:36,409
- Yeah, well...
- They're after his daughter.

388
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:37,770
He's just trying to protect her.

389
00:24:37,862 --> 00:24:39,993
He is the one person
who can take them down.

390
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:42,027
This is our only shot
to get our lives back.

391
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:43,204
I don't have a life.

392
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:45,935
Hey, you're always talking
about how you want to die,

393
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:48,270
yet you fight like hell to stay alive.

394
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:50,758
Some part of you wants to live,

395
00:24:51,052 --> 00:24:53,006
and for that, we need Bennet!

396
00:24:57,415 --> 00:24:58,954
That went better than I expected.

397
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,610
Ma?

398
00:25:08,114 --> 00:25:09,114
Where is he?

399
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,488
He's gone, Nathan.

400
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:29,785
He isn't supposed to die this way.

401
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,985
He's not supposed to die this way.

402
00:25:35,376 --> 00:25:36,504
He was wrong.

403
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:42,794
What do we do?

404
00:25:44,738 --> 00:25:45,738
We hide it.

405
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
What?

406
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:51,319
'Till after the election.

407
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,834
Last thing he would have wanted
was to bring you down with him.

408
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,109
Why does it matter anymore?

409
00:25:58,176 --> 00:26:00,383
Peter's dead.
I'm not having this conversation.

410
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,265
I know you don't want me here.

411
00:26:13,676 --> 00:26:14,953
I just want to see him.

412
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:17,035
I came all this way.

413
00:26:21,548 --> 00:26:23,159
Let the girl have her moment.

414
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,142
I didn't even get to know you.

415
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:46,863
You're the only one
that made me feel safe.

416
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,311
I thought you were like me.

417
00:27:31,894 --> 00:27:32,894
You saved my life.

418
00:27:34,706 --> 00:27:35,872
Guess we're even now.

419
00:27:45,655 --> 00:27:47,647
What do you do with something
that killed you?

420
00:27:47,938 --> 00:27:49,956
You could put it underneath your pillow.

421
00:27:50,775 --> 00:27:52,325
I don't know what I would have done.

422
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:54,495
Don't think about it.

423
00:27:56,957 --> 00:27:58,897
- I didn't die.
- Yeah, but if you had...

424
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:03,275
I don't know who I am without you.

425
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:05,161
Of course you do,
you're Nathan Petrelli.

426
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:08,212
Top of his class, valedictorian,
most likely to...

427
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:11,955
You're that guy with me or without me.

428
00:28:12,301 --> 00:28:14,352
Who's to say I'm not all that
because of you?

429
00:28:14,846 --> 00:28:16,078
Most of what we are

430
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:18,260
is what people expect us to be.

431
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,938
I mean, if you take them away,
nothing means anything.

432
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:23,499
It's a good thing I can't die then.

433
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:26,725
- What?
- Oh, I got that from Claire.

434
00:28:27,797 --> 00:28:28,852
She can regenerate.

435
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:32,262
No matter what happens?

436
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:33,924
I think so.

437
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,177
What about that painting?

438
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,479
You explode.
If that happened, you could survive it?

439
00:28:40,605 --> 00:28:42,039
Doesn't really matter, does it?

440
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,304
Think about it for a minute.

441
00:28:45,484 --> 00:28:46,511
If I go nuclear...

442
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:49,583
if I blow up New York,

443
00:28:49,986 --> 00:28:52,164
do you know how many people
are gonna die?

444
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:54,703
.07%.

445
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,621
Talk to her, Nathan.

446
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,895
She wants to know her father.

447
00:29:01,796 --> 00:29:03,313
I can't deal with that right now.

448
00:29:03,757 --> 00:29:06,267
She's not just some girl,
she's your daughter.

449
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,742
You know that Mom wants to send her
to Paris? You can't let her go!

450
00:29:11,562 --> 00:29:12,562
Don't you get it?

451
00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:15,795
Claire's the girl that I saved...
in Texas.

452
00:29:15,935 --> 00:29:18,191
- Save the cheerleader...
- save the world. I get it.

453
00:29:18,286 --> 00:29:21,091
And she turns out to be your daughter...
your daughter!

454
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:23,563
Look around.

455
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,491
Everything I said is happening,
is happening now.

456
00:29:26,575 --> 00:29:27,587
It's real.

457
00:29:29,544 --> 00:29:32,676
Maybe if Claire's here,
I don't blow up.

458
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:36,034
Maybe she's here to save us.

459
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:38,922
Talk to her, Nathan.

460
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:41,375
We need her.

461
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:51,888
About what just happened,

462
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,081
Nathan and I need to talk to you.

463
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:57,412
It's okay, I know.

464
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,118
I knew long before either of you did.

465
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:08,500
I recommend the cherry pie.

466
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:10,723
Shouldn't we keep a lower profile?

467
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:12,573
They won't come after us
in a public place.

468
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:14,628
- They wouldn't risk it.
- How can you be so sure?

469
00:30:17,311 --> 00:30:18,311
Point taken.

470
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:20,979
Eat up. It's a long road ahead.

471
00:30:21,051 --> 00:30:22,981
Forget it,
I'm getting the hell out of here.

472
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:24,179
They will find you.

473
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,378
As long as they have
that tracking system,

474
00:30:26,487 --> 00:30:27,536
you'll never be safe.

475
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,193
Neither will Claire.

476
00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:32,066
Look...

477
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:34,498
the system is well-protected,

478
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:36,269
but we can get to it, destroy it.

479
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,480
No more bagging and tagging.
No more looking over your shoulder.

480
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,467
We can end it all.
Where is this tracking system?

481
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:43,694
New York City.

482
00:30:44,688 --> 00:30:46,032
We're leaving on the next bus.

483
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:48,053
Is this where Linderman is?

484
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:51,278
Where did you get that name?

485
00:30:52,187 --> 00:30:53,633
From your boss, Thompson.

486
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:56,156
He was thinking about sending us
to go see Linderman.

487
00:30:56,206 --> 00:30:58,330
I just figured that must be
who you're working for.

488
00:30:58,618 --> 00:30:59,631
Wait a minute...

489
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:03,860
You didn't know that?

490
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,802
You're trying to take down
your organization,

491
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:09,740
you don't even know
who signs your checks?

492
00:31:13,135 --> 00:31:14,352
My God!

493
00:31:14,948 --> 00:31:17,490
- You're middle management!
- So what's that supposed to mean?

494
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,879
What it means is he's a schlub,
just like the rest of us.

495
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:21,230
Linderman isn't in New York.

496
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:22,513
He's in Las Vegas.

497
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,125
So this is really Linderman Linderman,

498
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,946
the mobster who owns all those casinos?

499
00:31:26,947 --> 00:31:29,801
- What does he have to do with all this?
- Apparently more than I knew.

500
00:31:29,874 --> 00:31:32,119
I say we go to Vegas.
We take the fight to Linderman.

501
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,977
We stick with the plan.

502
00:31:34,201 --> 00:31:35,978
We take out the tracking system.

503
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:38,799
And then whoever's left standing
can go after Linderman.

504
00:31:40,825 --> 00:31:41,825
New York.

505
00:31:44,512 --> 00:31:45,900
I've always wanted to go.

506
00:31:47,515 --> 00:31:48,848
You boys ready to order?

507
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:53,118
But why'd you have to pick me up
so early today from school?

508
00:31:53,234 --> 00:31:54,485
Today's a special day.

509
00:31:57,642 --> 00:31:58,643
Mom?

510
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:04,765
The man we're gonna meet,

511
00:32:05,386 --> 00:32:08,656
well, let's just say
he changes all the rules.

512
00:32:09,325 --> 00:32:10,783
And he wants to meet me?

513
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:13,207
He knows
that you do the most amazing things.

514
00:32:13,426 --> 00:32:15,153
I told him
he doesn't know the half of it.

515
00:32:15,198 --> 00:32:16,306
My son the genius.

516
00:32:16,993 --> 00:32:18,406
So I don't have to pretend

517
00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:20,458
about what we can do, like dad said?

518
00:32:20,575 --> 00:32:21,974
That's all right, gentlemen.

519
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:24,623
I want to greet this young man myself.

520
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,474
It's a great pleasure
to meet you, Micah.

521
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:32,589
Thank you.

522
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:35,946
How would you like
to save the world today?

523
00:33:05,627 --> 00:33:06,760
Cute car.

524
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,535
You know why Peter Petrelli came here?

525
00:33:14,323 --> 00:33:15,323
He wanted my help.

526
00:33:15,825 --> 00:33:17,180
Instead, I got him killed.

527
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:20,285
You did the right thing calling us.

528
00:33:21,024 --> 00:33:23,555
I tried to stop Sylar...

529
00:33:23,674 --> 00:33:24,768
but I couldn't.

530
00:33:24,825 --> 00:33:28,114
I'm a scientist. I can't fight someone
who defies the laws of physics.

531
00:33:28,198 --> 00:33:29,198
You can.

532
00:33:30,512 --> 00:33:31,851
You just need help.

533
00:33:32,605 --> 00:33:33,829
You're not the one I called.

534
00:33:34,092 --> 00:33:35,378
Glasses, tall fella?

535
00:33:37,134 --> 00:33:38,444
He's no longer with the company.

536
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:40,326
You know,

537
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:42,880
you've been going about this
all wrong, Professor.

538
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:46,221
Trying to take on the science
and the killer all on your own?

539
00:33:46,718 --> 00:33:48,089
What you're dealing with,

540
00:33:48,698 --> 00:33:51,252
no man should face without friends.

541
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:54,557
Now, we can provide you
with the resources...

542
00:33:54,673 --> 00:33:56,339
I didn't call about my research.

543
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:59,352
The man who murdered my father
and Peter Petrelli is still out there.

544
00:33:59,447 --> 00:34:01,630
That takes precedence
over any academics.

545
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:03,541
A person that dangerous must be stopped.

546
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:06,492
I can assure you
we have similar priorities.

547
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:08,830
The best way to stop Sylar

548
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:11,379
is for us to work together.

549
00:34:23,084 --> 00:34:24,992
You really can paint the future.

550
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:28,510
Just like the professor said. Fantastic.

551
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,433
You're late.

552
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,519
I guess you know why I'm here.

553
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:39,600
You're the one who's gonna kill me.

554
00:34:39,885 --> 00:34:40,885
That's true.

555
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:48,141
This is usually the part
when people start screaming.

556
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,093
I tried fighting the future.

557
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,311
It's too big for me.

558
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,120
Maybe you can do better.

559
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,385
Why me?

560
00:34:58,824 --> 00:35:00,935
Do you see some special future for me?

561
00:35:03,073 --> 00:35:04,073
They stop you...

562
00:35:05,286 --> 00:35:06,351
and you die.

563
00:35:10,198 --> 00:35:11,586
You painted all that too?

564
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Show me.

565
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,323
Show me!

566
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:23,261
Now, now.

567
00:35:33,823 --> 00:35:34,823
It's already gone.

568
00:35:35,994 --> 00:35:37,871
Why don't you tell me all about it then?

569
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:41,372
I've seen enough of the future.

570
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:43,187
I don't need to watch it happen.

571
00:35:47,323 --> 00:35:48,384
I've wasted my life,

572
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:50,607
destroyed everything good
that ever came to me.

573
00:35:52,763 --> 00:35:54,871
At least I did one good thing
before I died.

574
00:36:00,802 --> 00:36:03,680
You can't fight the future.

575
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
Neither can you.

576
00:36:11,097 --> 00:36:12,099
It's all right.

577
00:36:13,793 --> 00:36:15,807
I finally know my part in all of this.

578
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:18,989
To die here with you.

579
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,043
But not before I show them
how to kill you...

580
00:36:25,387 --> 00:36:26,387
and stop the bomb.

581
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:30,198
I finally get to be a hero.

582
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:08,980
Your mom said you wanted to talk to me.

583
00:37:10,218 --> 00:37:11,991
I did... I do. Come in, please.

584
00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:22,290
This should have happened
a long time ago,

585
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:23,641
under better circumstances.

586
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:28,587
It shouldn't take someone nearly dying
for the two of us to finally meet.

587
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,031
You know, you don't have to do this...

588
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,998
pretend to be nice to me.

589
00:37:33,268 --> 00:37:34,323
I'm not pretending.

590
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:37,696
Claire, most people...

591
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:40,449
they think the worst of me,

592
00:37:40,483 --> 00:37:43,289
and I've probably given them
good reason to. But I want to do better.

593
00:37:44,614 --> 00:37:45,943
I want to be there for you.

594
00:37:49,578 --> 00:37:50,578
But I can't.

595
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:53,769
Not now.

596
00:37:55,082 --> 00:37:56,082
Of course.

597
00:37:56,205 --> 00:37:58,349
I'm sorry, but there are things
happening right now

598
00:37:58,413 --> 00:38:00,502
that I can't expect you to understand.

599
00:38:02,516 --> 00:38:04,237
I barely understand them myself.

600
00:38:05,331 --> 00:38:06,717
I got into politics

601
00:38:07,656 --> 00:38:10,925
for the chance to... do something good.

602
00:38:12,644 --> 00:38:14,039
I have a chance to help.

603
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,045
To be a part of something big.

604
00:38:16,955 --> 00:38:19,227
- But in order to do that, I have...
- The election.

605
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:23,277
You can't have
some illegitimate daughter

606
00:38:23,373 --> 00:38:25,124
popping up and waving at the cameras.

607
00:38:25,718 --> 00:38:26,766
I need to win.

608
00:38:28,396 --> 00:38:29,577
You need me to leave.

609
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,877
Paris, with my grandmother.

610
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,158
She warms up.

611
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:38,955
Sort of.

612
00:38:39,986 --> 00:38:41,040
It's just one week.

613
00:38:42,515 --> 00:38:43,515
And then what?

614
00:38:50,065 --> 00:38:52,206
And then you come home to your family.

615
00:38:55,081 --> 00:38:56,081
Okay?

616
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:18,184
You!

617
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:20,261
Me?
