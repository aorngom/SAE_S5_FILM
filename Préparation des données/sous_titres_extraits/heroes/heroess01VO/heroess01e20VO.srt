00:00:01,031 --> 00:00:02,370
<i>Previously on</i> Heroes...

2
00:00:02,656 --> 00:00:03,802
Peter Petrelli,

3
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:05,393
my name is Hiro Nakamura.

4
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:06,813
I'm from the future.

5
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:08,381
I've a message for you.

6
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:10,114
The cheerleader, you have to save her.

7
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:11,507
It's the only way to prevent it.

8
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:13,310
- Prevent what?
- Everything.

9
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:17,866
He says that we all meet up... somehow.
Sometime in the future, I guess.

10
00:00:17,947 --> 00:00:18,978
I see.

11
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:21,477
He said something bad is gonna happen,
but we could stop it.

12
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:29,599
To die, here.

13
00:00:29,927 --> 00:00:32,401
With you. But not before
I show them how to kill you

14
00:00:32,778 --> 00:00:33,878
and stop the bomb.

15
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:36,431
Whether you're sixteen, or sixty four,

16
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:38,858
I will be there for you, always.

17
00:00:39,098 --> 00:00:41,725
Eleven years
and I am still directing traffic.

18
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:43,580
I wish you could see what I see.

19
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,321
We're having a baby!

20
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:47,158
I need you to know that I would never

21
00:00:47,307 --> 00:00:48,760
let anything happen to you.

22
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:50,393
You're gonna win your election.

23
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:51,750
I'll see to that.

24
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:45,200
You.

25
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:47,201
Me?

26
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,250
What are you doing here?

27
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,428
You're not supposed to be here.

28
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,250
None of this is supposed to be here.

29
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,550
It was an accident.

30
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,850
We time traveled.

31
00:01:57,848 --> 00:01:59,050
What happened to the city?

32
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:05,244
The bomb.

33
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,064
The bomb still happened.

34
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:13,013
It was all supposed to change.

35
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,633
Five years ago, a man named Sylar
exploded in the heart of the city,

36
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,150
changing the world forever.

37
00:02:22,648 --> 00:02:24,103
I thought I had it all figured out.

38
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,750
I thought I had it all beat.

39
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:12,790
Save the cheerleader...

40
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:13,933
Save the world!

41
00:03:14,475 --> 00:03:16,534
You visited Peter Petrelli
with this message.

42
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,352
Yes, did he do it?
Did Peter save her?

43
00:03:18,511 --> 00:03:19,650
Yes, he did.

44
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,350
Claire is still alive.

45
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,434
Which means Sylar never took her power.

46
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,209
Which means you were able
to kill him, right?

47
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:29,103
Me? Kill Sylar?

48
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,780
Because he had the cheerleader's power.

49
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,782
But I can't go back.

50
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,650
I can't control my powers.

51
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:22,679
If I try,
Ando and I can appear anywhere.

52
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,932
Well, what do you know?

53
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,550
Hiro Nakamura.

54
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,950
Go after his friends!

55
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,850
The Haitian stays with me.

56
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,963
I want to take him in personally.

57
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:52,251
What?

58
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,615
What's going on?

59
00:04:57,038 --> 00:04:59,646
Get out of those clothes.
You're sticking out like a sore thumb.

60
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:02,292
What happened to Hiro? Who was that?

61
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:03,789
Homeland Security.

62
00:05:03,882 --> 00:05:04,884
The government?

63
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:07,457
They're taking him to a special
holding facility in midtown.

64
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,550
How can you be so sure?

65
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:10,667
Because that's where
they take the terrorists.

66
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,368
Why would anyone think that Hiro's a...

67
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,750
You? A terrorist?

68
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,750
After Sylar exploded,

69
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,448
the world became a very dark place.

70
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:26,304
And that is why we need to change it.

71
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,750
Get him back so he can kill Sylar.

72
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,114
Then let's go get Hiro.

73
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,350
You can freeze time. We'll teleport in.

74
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,756
No, it's not that simple.

75
00:05:35,396 --> 00:05:37,247
The Haitian has a way
of stopping my powers.

76
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:40,156
We need help.

77
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,010
There's only one person
who's powerful enough to get us through.

78
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:48,128
Peter Petrelli.
We're going to Las Vegas.

79
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,708
Subtitles: swsub.com

80
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:14,042
This is where we're going
to find Peter Petrelli?

81
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:17,517
This is where we find his girlfriend.

82
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:30,336
And now in the center stage, gentlemen,

83
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:33,950
please, give it up
for the main event, Jessica!

84
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:45,050
Maybe the future's not so bad.

85
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:10,275
You have one song,
two minutes, and $500.

86
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:11,715
After that, you're out of here.

87
00:07:12,022 --> 00:07:13,081
You got me, Hiro?

88
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:17,523
It's me, Niki. Ando.
Do you remember?

89
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:19,511
Is this how you're gonna use your time?

90
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,647
I need to find Peter. It's important.

91
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:23,610
War's over, General Chow.

92
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:24,850
We lost, remember?

93
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,950
Peter's not interested.

94
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:29,150
You could talk to him.

95
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,402
Tell him it's about stopping Sylar.

96
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,318
You say that name again,
and I will break your neck.

97
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:43,720
Do you know where Bennet is?

98
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:53,450
As far as I know,
he's still rustling cattle in Texas.

99
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:04,140
How are the receipts tonight, Marco?

100
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,589
It was a good night, ma'am.

101
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:06,926
Good.

102
00:08:12,948 --> 00:08:14,050
You don't have to be here.

103
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:16,850
I told you that I can handle it.

104
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:19,144
What did he want?

105
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:22,101
What do you think?

106
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,778
He's still trying
to stop an exploding man.

107
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:26,907
Hey, Sylar's dead.

108
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:29,750
I sent him off to Bennet.
Just let him deal.

109
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,850
Of all days, huh?

110
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,050
Today is just another day.

111
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:48,536
You lost your son, Niki...

112
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,050
It's called letting go.

113
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,050
Maybe you should give it a try.

114
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:58,271
Or would you rather go off with
your buddy and fight the pain away?

115
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:02,350
I'm not going anywhere.

116
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,250
This is all misunderstanding.

117
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,273
Hiro Nakamura.

118
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:51,976
Born Osaka, Japan,
to Kaito and Ishi.

119
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,950
Teleportation. Stopping time.

120
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,450
Prison breaks.

121
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,249
Attacks against U.S. interests.

122
00:09:58,408 --> 00:10:00,550
No, I don't think
there's any misunderstanding.

123
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:01,950
Prison breaks?

124
00:10:02,072 --> 00:10:04,718
Two years ago,
you killed a lot of good men

125
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,120
when you raided
the National Science Center in Raleigh.

126
00:10:07,446 --> 00:10:10,791
No, I know myself. I'm not a killer.

127
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:20,350
How can you not remember that?

128
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:23,335
Because I do not know
what you are talking about.

129
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:26,515
I'm talking about men like you and Sylar
ruining it for the rest of us.

130
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:28,758
Making us live in fear, captivity,
and hiding.

131
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,150
Making us choose sides.

132
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,550
Tearing families apart.

133
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,450
I would never tear a family apart.

134
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:40,463
<i>I just want to be a hero.</i>

135
00:10:42,296 --> 00:10:44,261
I don't know what kind of game
you're playing.

136
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,881
What you're hiding.
But I'm gonna get it out of you.

137
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:50,557
That's right. We got him.

138
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,189
We've been after him for years,

139
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,950
and today he decides to get sloppy
just before the anniversary?

140
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:58,237
<i>I thought that'd be good news
to announce at the speech tomorrow.</i>

141
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,549
This can't be a coincidence.
They're up to something.

142
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,607
I need to know what it is.

143
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,048
That could be a problem.

144
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:05,278
He seems to remember nothing
about the last 5 years.

145
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,457
<i>You sure it's...</i>

146
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:09,694
It's really him? It's not a trick
or an illusion or something?

147
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,265
Anything seems possible these days.

148
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,760
There be something we've overlooked.

149
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,350
<i>You're a mind reader, Parkman.</i>

150
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,950
Rip it out of him.

151
00:11:19,302 --> 00:11:21,462
If you can't do it,
I'll get someone who can.

152
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:23,937
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

153
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,514
Send in the professor.

154
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:39,853
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

155
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:42,450
We've captured Hiro Nakamura
in Manhattan.

156
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,219
That's excellent news, Mr. President.

157
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:46,311
It seems we're running
into some problems.

158
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:49,313
You're the only person I trust
to figure out what's going on up there.

159
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:51,038
I'll be on the first flight to New York.

160
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:53,049
Thank you.
That's not why I asked you here.

161
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:54,190
Please sit down.

162
00:11:56,945 --> 00:12:00,350
Five years ago, you and I allowed a man
to blow up in New York.

163
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:03,222
Millions of lives came to an end,

164
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,663
and the world was changed.

165
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,550
Soon after we sat down in my office.
Do you remember?

166
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:10,682
Of course. We made a pact
to eliminate such danger at any cost.

167
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,393
Billions in research later...

168
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,189
how close are we to that?

169
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,250
We...

170
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,265
we're not much closer to reversing
their condition than when we started.

171
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,766
What's the problem?

172
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:27,053
It's hard coded in their DNA.

173
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,905
It's like they're a separate species.

174
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:31,273
We cannot change who they are,
Mr. President.

175
00:12:31,403 --> 00:12:32,761
So in other words, we've failed.

176
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,552
No, the measures we've put in place...

177
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,683
They're not working!

178
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,625
We've outlawed their breeding.
We've confined their movement.

179
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,450
We police them. We track them.
Their attacks continue.

180
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,850
Their population is increasing
exponentially.

181
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,501
Your numbers...

182
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:48,749
Yesterday in Santa Cruz,

183
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,849
a boy somehow sucked
all the oxygen out of the air.

184
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:53,750
Suffocated his entire middle school.

185
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,450
My God.

186
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,656
These events are increasing.

187
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:02,150
People are anticipating another Sylar.

188
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:08,008
In your original assessment,
you posited a potential solution.

189
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:10,701
Extinction.

190
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:12,482
Yes, but I never meant
to suggest that...

191
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:14,749
"They wouldn't be the first species
to be exterminated

192
00:13:14,886 --> 00:13:16,466
"for the preservation of another. "

193
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:18,349
Your words.

194
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:21,006
I was talking about the natural order
of things.

195
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,814
What you're talking about is genocide!

196
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,188
Self-defense!

197
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,750
And I'm not suggesting it lightly.

198
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,150
We've just run out of options.

199
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,250
You haven't slept in five years,
Mohinder.

200
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,050
We need to put an end to this.

201
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:38,150
You're one of them, Nathan.

202
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:41,211
Am I supposed to march you off
to the gas chambers as well?

203
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:44,763
I'm thankful for the secrets
you've kept.

204
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,719
But let's be honest.

205
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,632
I can fly. I'm hardly dangerous.

206
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,199
I value your opinion as a scientist
and a friend.

207
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:58,549
But if I gave you five years, ten years,

208
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:00,650
20 more years, be honest with me...

209
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:05,280
could you reverse it?

210
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:09,750
Probably not.

211
00:14:11,793 --> 00:14:14,150
Then we need to start thinking
about Plan B.

212
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:20,019
I don't care about five years ago!

213
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,746
What are you planning for tonight?

214
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,850
You are like me. Special.

215
00:14:30,362 --> 00:14:32,750
Why do you want to hurt
other special people?

216
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:39,120
Yeah, it's Parkman.

217
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,150
Suresh? What's he doing there?

218
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:45,131
Watch him.

219
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:10,250
You ready?

220
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,650
Pad turns red...

221
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:15,361
you're one of them
and they'll arrest you.

222
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,179
Pad turns blue, you're free to go.

223
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:25,993
From now on you will be the Cranes
from Boise, Idaho.

224
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,047
We've enclosed back stories,

225
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,842
references, and money, okay?

226
00:15:31,324 --> 00:15:32,829
How do we know when we're safe?

227
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:34,550
You don't.

228
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,457
Not ever.

229
00:15:41,717 --> 00:15:44,550
Always keep a refrigerated
sample of this on your person.

230
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:46,550
Buy a thermos.

231
00:15:47,097 --> 00:15:48,609
Now you're gonna have to be vigilant.

232
00:15:50,572 --> 00:15:51,820
Always on the lookout.

233
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:55,350
Can you do that, son?

234
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:00,050
Yes, sir.

235
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,535
- Good man.
- Okay, we have to go.

236
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,050
Do whatever it takes to protect him.

237
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:30,550
It's out of the question.

238
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:34,582
It's Homeland Security.
I need help getting in there.

239
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,750
These people trust me.

240
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,419
They come to me to keep them hidden.

241
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:39,383
You're asking me to do
the exact opposite!

242
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,613
I'm only asking for the ones
that I brought to you.

243
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,517
D.L., Candice, Molly Walker!

244
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,514
And they'll all be safe when we succeed!

245
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,902
Sorry, I can't help you.

246
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,150
He saved your daughter's life!

247
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,607
- Excuse me?
- Your daughter. The cheerleader.

248
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:54,350
She's alive because of Hiro.

249
00:16:57,498 --> 00:16:58,650
What is he talking about?

250
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:02,049
Five years ago,
I asked Peter to save Claire

251
00:17:02,183 --> 00:17:03,950
from Sylar at Homecoming.

252
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:05,689
My friend tells me he did it.

253
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:08,050
Claire's alive.

254
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:10,050
Isn't she?

255
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:20,501
You guys sit tight.

256
00:17:21,505 --> 00:17:22,774
I'll see what I can do.

257
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:26,809
Each string represents a person.

258
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:29,450
Every action, every choice.

259
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,750
How people came together,
how they were torn apart.

260
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:34,750
It's a living map of the past.

261
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,550
Why would a terrorist
care so much about the past?

262
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:44,491
Maybe he thought he could change it.

263
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,859
Hiro Nakamura can stop time.

264
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:52,272
Teleport by folding space.
Theoretically, he can fold time as well.

265
00:17:54,244 --> 00:17:56,350
So you're saying he's a time traveler.

266
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:59,962
Is that any stranger
than being able to read someone's mind?

267
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,750
Yeah, it is.

268
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:06,249
Haven't you ever wished
you could change the past?

269
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:07,821
Set your life down a different path?

270
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,107
I used to be that guy.

271
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,266
Wishing it and making it happen
are two different things.

272
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:16,143
Not for Nakamura it isn't. Look here.

273
00:18:17,974 --> 00:18:20,650
These two dates seem to be
the focal points. Both in the past.

274
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,535
The first is the bomb. The other...

275
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,314
What? What is it?

276
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,150
The other's the day
I received my father's ashes.

277
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,896
I was with Peter Petrelli that day.

278
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:38,664
On the subway, he said
he saw a man who could freeze time.

279
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:40,065
- Nakamura?
- I don't know.

280
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,842
He said he had a message for Peter.

281
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:44,183
What?

282
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:45,647
What was the message?

283
00:18:51,623 --> 00:18:52,719
What was the message?

284
00:18:54,586 --> 00:18:55,750
Save the cheerleader...

285
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,914
save the world.

286
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,950
All right, here are you chilequiles
and your waffle platter.

287
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,056
Now just holler at me
if y'all need anything else.

288
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:19,179
<i>Right now we're watching
live footage of the President</i>

289
00:19:19,311 --> 00:19:21,787
<i>approaching Marine 1
for his trip to his home state,</i>

290
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:22,996
<i>New York.</i>

291
00:19:23,255 --> 00:19:25,409
<i>The White House promises
a major policy...</i>

292
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,690
You know, Sandra, for a girl
who's supposed to hate the President,

293
00:19:28,816 --> 00:19:30,550
you sure do perk up whenever he's on.

294
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,350
A guy could get jealous.

295
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,034
He's old enough to be my father.

296
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:42,864
So what did you think of Rafferty's?

297
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:45,409
For the reception?

298
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:47,989
You were supposed
to check it out, remember?

299
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,250
I'm sorry. I forgot.

300
00:19:55,122 --> 00:19:56,691
You're not getting cold feet, are you?

301
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,895
No, of course not.

302
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,950
My feet are very warm.

303
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,682
Two pairs of socks warm.

304
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:04,150
Well, good.

305
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,530
'Cause I'm kind of crazy about you.

306
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:08,959
You know that.

307
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:13,950
The creepy guy with glasses is back.

308
00:20:14,535 --> 00:20:15,950
Sitting in your section again.

309
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:31,445
- There we go.
- Thanks.

310
00:20:32,552 --> 00:20:34,329
Would you like
a scoop of ice cream on that?

311
00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:37,049
No, not today, thank you.

312
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:39,250
But my table's a little sticky.

313
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,750
Someone knows about you, Claire.

314
00:20:46,774 --> 00:20:49,250
You need to leave as soon as possible.

315
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,150
There's a bag on the chair to my right.

316
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,550
Leave?

317
00:20:58,784 --> 00:21:00,144
What am I supposed to tell Andy?

318
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,235
Tell him nothing. Just go.

319
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,876
I can't do that to him.

320
00:21:07,648 --> 00:21:08,750
We're getting married.

321
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:13,975
Have you told him?

322
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,216
All I want is a normal life, Dad.

323
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,250
I've done my best
to provide that for you.

324
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,097
But people
are starting to ask questions.

325
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:27,950
Now I am trying
to control the information,

326
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,450
but it's not safe here anymore.

327
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:33,608
I've been hiding for five years.
California, Nevada.

328
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,250
I brought you back to Midland.

329
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,550
Only after Mom left.

330
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:42,928
<i>This word just coming in.
We have breaking news...</i>

331
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,543
I just want you to be safe.

332
00:21:44,752 --> 00:21:47,549
<i>...where enforcement agents
have just bravely rounded up</i>

333
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,850
<i>over 200 undocumented individuals</i>

334
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,450
<i>as part of a coordinated
nationwide sweep.</i>

335
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,149
<i>This has been cited as the department's
most successful operation</i>

336
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:58,750
<i>since the Linderman Act
was passed four years ago.</i>

337
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,030
<i>Homeland Security spokesmen</i>

338
00:22:01,172 --> 00:22:03,949
<i>praised the near-perfect execution
of local police,</i>

339
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:06,815
<i>citing zero casualties
on the enforcement side...</i>

340
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,101
Enjoy your pie.

341
00:22:16,686 --> 00:22:19,287
<i>The incident resulted
in the safe transport of suspects</i>

342
00:22:19,443 --> 00:22:22,391
<i>to special holding facilities
within their states,</i>

343
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,349
<i>where the individuals will meet
with federally provided attorneys</i>

344
00:22:25,686 --> 00:22:27,250
<i>to discuss their legal options.</i>

345
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,249
<i>And a note to our viewers.</i>

346
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:31,448
<i>If you see any suspicious activity,
please...</i>

347
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,150
D.L. can phase inside the buildings.

348
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,391
Candice's illusion
can distract the guards.

349
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:38,339
Hey, what about me?

350
00:22:38,674 --> 00:22:39,713
You'll help too.

351
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:41,102
That's not what I meant.

352
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,241
What happened to me? Where am I?

353
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,350
Am I rich? Married?

354
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:48,519
I can't tell you that.

355
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,398
- Why not?
- Because...

356
00:23:01,652 --> 00:23:04,997
So... my friend is still in there.

357
00:23:11,504 --> 00:23:13,015
There's something I need to tell you.

358
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,850
We already caught you.

359
00:23:30,018 --> 00:23:32,116
Two Hiros. Son of a bitch!

360
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:33,703
He really can travel through time.

361
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,550
What?

362
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,095
Your friends got away.

363
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:22,431
If they were my friends,
I wouldn't have called you, Matt.

364
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,850
Yeah, thanks for the heads up.

365
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,250
That's the deal, right?

366
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,535
I turn you on to the dangerous refugees,

367
00:24:28,272 --> 00:24:29,859
and you let me help the harmless ones.

368
00:24:29,992 --> 00:24:32,391
Doesn't hurt that we're both
harboring children of interest.

369
00:24:32,486 --> 00:24:34,560
Of course,
mine isn't the President's daughter.

370
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:36,550
She's getting married.

371
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:39,524
Mazel-Tov. I guess.

372
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,650
Have you...
you heard anything from Janice?

373
00:24:59,441 --> 00:25:02,350
You ever wish
you did something different?

374
00:25:02,654 --> 00:25:03,901
Wish you took a different path?

375
00:25:04,674 --> 00:25:05,713
Every day.

376
00:25:11,795 --> 00:25:13,250
You did right by her, Matt.

377
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:15,461
You did right by him.

378
00:25:16,504 --> 00:25:17,518
Thanks.

379
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:20,553
I really appreciate
all you've done for them.

380
00:25:30,636 --> 00:25:31,639
What are you doing?!

381
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,450
I'm ending our arrangement.

382
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,150
Unfortunately, I have to explain
to the President

383
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,050
that there's a second Hiro Nakamura
out there.

384
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:44,257
Then I gotta tell him
how I let him get away.

385
00:25:45,184 --> 00:25:46,793
See, I can't come back empty handed.

386
00:25:46,902 --> 00:25:48,250
Now tell me where she is.

387
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:16,443
Let's elope.

388
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:19,950
- What?
- Let's elope.

389
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,679
Right now, run away. I'm thinking Vegas.

390
00:26:22,835 --> 00:26:24,688
We'll pack our bags.
Get hitched tonight.

391
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,750
Take off, see the world.
What do you think?

392
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:29,752
I think you're crazy.

393
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,130
Maybe.

394
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,058
Probably.

395
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,550
But I've got my reasons.

396
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,149
And I promise I'll tell you everything.

397
00:26:46,457 --> 00:26:47,461
Will you do it?

398
00:26:48,277 --> 00:26:49,309
For me?

399
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,950
I'll do anything for you.

400
00:26:55,913 --> 00:26:57,170
Let me get my things.

401
00:27:04,132 --> 00:27:05,149
Coffee?

402
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,152
Can I get something for you, sir?

403
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,293
I don't know, Claire. What's good?

404
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,418
Save the cheerleader, save the world.
What does that mean?

405
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,150
How do you know that?

406
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:31,451
5 years ago,
Peter Petrelli and I were on the subway.

407
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:33,050
He said someone stopped time.

408
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:35,043
That's what you do, Mr. Nakamura.

409
00:27:35,535 --> 00:27:38,049
Peter and I were on our way
to see Isaac Mendez that day.

410
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,165
An artist who can paint the future.

411
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,350
A lot of his work
is remarkably accurate.

412
00:27:45,386 --> 00:27:46,425
Except this.

413
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,343
Is that a new 9th Wonder?

414
00:27:48,488 --> 00:27:51,115
The events in this comic.
History didn't happen like this.

415
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,796
You didn't kill Sylar.

416
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,706
You're trying to change the past.

417
00:27:55,873 --> 00:27:57,665
Trying to stop Sylar, is that it?

418
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,750
If you could save millions of lives,
wouldn't you?

419
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,461
Thank you.

420
00:28:15,717 --> 00:28:17,041
Is that really you, Ando?

421
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:19,105
Why are you so surprised to see me?

422
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,171
He didn't tell you.

423
00:28:24,182 --> 00:28:25,186
What?

424
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:27,021
You're... dead.

425
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,827
- How?
- In New York.

426
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:32,955
The bomb.

427
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:35,501
Really?

428
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,612
Do you remember how he used to be?
All full of hope and optimism?

429
00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:44,250
Of course. That's the Hiro I know.

430
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,999
He went away the day you died.

431
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,733
Between you and me,

432
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,249
I think you're the reason
why he became so obsessed

433
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,049
with trying to change it all back.

434
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,350
He wants to save you.

435
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:05,739
Baby, you in here?

436
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:18,551
Nakamura was trying
to find a way to kill Sylar

437
00:29:18,654 --> 00:29:19,850
before he exploded.

438
00:29:21,156 --> 00:29:22,701
You think he can make that happen?

439
00:29:22,842 --> 00:29:24,150
I do. Think about it.

440
00:29:24,356 --> 00:29:26,047
Without Sylar,
the world would have never

441
00:29:26,142 --> 00:29:27,780
considered these people to be dangerous.

442
00:29:27,874 --> 00:29:29,507
None of this would've ever happened.

443
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:31,050
Imagine the possibilities.

444
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:34,650
If he kills Sylar,
we can change the past.

445
00:29:36,704 --> 00:29:37,990
I don't have that luxury.

446
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,450
I need to find answers
in the here and now.

447
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,806
- Genocide is not an answer.
- Is that what this is about?

448
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:45,809
You're feeling bad
because you came up short?

449
00:29:45,926 --> 00:29:47,015
It's wrong.

450
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,546
I was elected to make hard decisions.

451
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,170
I understand how things work.

452
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,868
And how is this going to work?

453
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,570
Today I'm going to announce

454
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:58,250
that you've developed a treatment
to reverse this.

455
00:29:59,335 --> 00:30:00,450
You're going to lie.

456
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,449
The world will cheer.

457
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:05,652
And what happens
when people start dying?

458
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,915
I'll say you made a mistake.

459
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,255
A fatal error.

460
00:30:10,785 --> 00:30:11,793
At first,

461
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,450
the world will mourn.

462
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,850
They'll be united in grief.

463
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:18,750
And then they'll just be united.

464
00:30:21,285 --> 00:30:23,150
Mohinder,
I need to know if I can trust you.

465
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,365
I need to know if you're with me.

466
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,450
Are you with me on this?

467
00:30:33,236 --> 00:30:34,240
Of course.

468
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,152
Mr. President.

469
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,010
There are two of them, sir. Two...

470
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:42,434
Hiros.

471
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,249
- You're sure?
- I am.

472
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:46,048
I think we got the younger one.

473
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:47,950
It explains the gaps in his knowledge.

474
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:49,776
I want to put him down.

475
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,750
I want Dr. Suresh to do it.

476
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,452
Yes, sir.

477
00:31:04,776 --> 00:31:05,780
Mr. President...

478
00:31:07,374 --> 00:31:09,396
that's not the only thing
that I found in Texas.

479
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:22,290
I thought you were dead.

480
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,750
You have no idea
how important you are to me, Claire.

481
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,550
I'm not important.

482
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:30,774
I'm just a waitress.

483
00:31:32,276 --> 00:31:33,950
We both know that isn't true.

484
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:36,950
You made everyone afraid of us.

485
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,750
I made everyone aware of us.

486
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:43,742
Fear is just the natural response.

487
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:45,192
You can't blame them, really.

488
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,850
We're more powerful than they are.
More important.

489
00:31:49,195 --> 00:31:50,199
We're special.

490
00:31:51,363 --> 00:31:53,818
Who are you to decide
who's special and who's not?

491
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,750
I'm the leader of the free world.

492
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,234
For all I know,
I'm the most special person there is.

493
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:04,250
Lord knows I found enough power.

494
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,550
Met a lot of special people.

495
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,431
Like this girl named Candice
who allowed me to become President.

496
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:13,449
But I'm done.

497
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,249
I just want
to eliminate the competition.

498
00:32:19,082 --> 00:32:20,593
I don't need any more power.

499
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,596
Especially not after you.

500
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,650
I've waited a long time for this.

501
00:32:57,298 --> 00:32:59,352
You've always wanted
to become a kendo master.

502
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,730
I studied in Tohoku,
so technically I'm a Battojutsu master.

503
00:33:37,218 --> 00:33:41,292
- Remember what we promised each other?
- Yeah, I remember.

504
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:46,101
- Then why can't you just let it go?
- I'm not the one who can't let go.

505
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:48,944
You gonna call yourself Jessica on stage
night after night

506
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:50,366
and act like nothing gets to you?

507
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:52,909
We both know that's not true.
That is not who you are.

508
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,505
It is now.

509
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,785
You're gonna look in that mirror,

510
00:33:58,133 --> 00:34:00,750
but nobody is looking back but you.

511
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,750
She is gone, Niki.

512
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:05,750
D.L. is gone.

513
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:07,649
Micah is gone.

514
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:09,474
You have to accept your loss.

515
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,850
Jessica was right all along.

516
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,350
Look out for yourself.

517
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,614
- Don't get attached.
- I don't buy it.

518
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:21,250
Then why are you
in such a hurry to leave me?

519
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,749
My own reasons.

520
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:25,850
And I'm not leaving anything.
I'll be back.

521
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,050
What reasons?

522
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,050
What makes you think
that you are so important?

523
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,949
That you have to fix everything?

524
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,053
- Because I do.
- Why?

525
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,549
Why does it fall on your shoulders
to save everyone?

526
00:34:41,651 --> 00:34:43,150
Because it was me!

527
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,265
The bomb? It was me!

528
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:47,350
I killed all those people.

529
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,550
I killed Micah.

530
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:54,392
- It was Sylar. Everyone knows!
- It wasn't.

531
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:55,617
Nathan lied.

532
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:58,550
He lied to protect me.
He told everybody that it was Sylar.

533
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:01,424
Think about it. You know me.

534
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,133
You know what I can do.

535
00:35:03,826 --> 00:35:06,150
Listen, if there is a chance

536
00:35:06,816 --> 00:35:09,150
that Hiro can undo this,
I have to help him.

537
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,750
You walk out that door,
you don't come back.

538
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,273
Is everything okay?

539
00:35:23,492 --> 00:35:24,525
Let's go fix it.

540
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,950
My fellow Americans, fellow New Yorkers,

541
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,368
please let us take a moment
to remember the men,

542
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:36,950
women, and children
who were taken from us

543
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:39,050
five years ago.

544
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,232
Five bells

545
00:35:42,258 --> 00:35:43,731
for the five years of sorrow.

546
00:36:02,882 --> 00:36:04,093
<i>Sacrifice...</i>

547
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,950
is something
that we're all too familiar with.

548
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,150
We've all lost.

549
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,050
<i>We've all mourned.</i>

550
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,845
<i>And we've all had to become soldiers,</i>

551
00:36:16,106 --> 00:36:17,110
<i>heroes.</i>

552
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:20,350
<i>Protecting one another
from the gravest of dangers.</i>

553
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,850
<i>This is a battle that none of us wanted.</i>

554
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,050
<i>One that we entered with a heavy heart.</i>

555
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:28,450
Should we freeze time?

556
00:36:28,682 --> 00:36:30,650
No, I haven't had a good fight in years.

557
00:36:31,332 --> 00:36:33,177
<i>Knowing that the enemy was ourselves.</i>

558
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,685
We've won battles

559
00:36:36,712 --> 00:36:37,749
<i>the world over.</i>

560
00:36:37,832 --> 00:36:40,250
<i>Not only against those
that would do us harm,</i>

561
00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:44,008
<i>but against poverty,
reclaiming the environment...</i>

562
00:36:44,294 --> 00:36:46,350
<i>Upstairs our powers
will be blocked by the Haitian.</i>

563
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:48,213
We need to take him out
so the other Hiro

564
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,310
- can teleport out of here.
- But there are guards.

565
00:36:50,423 --> 00:36:52,526
Won't they be waiting for us with guns?

566
00:36:53,073 --> 00:36:54,687
<i>But we do not forget the price</i>

567
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:56,286
that we've had to pay.

568
00:36:56,582 --> 00:37:00,076
<i>The laws that we've had to pass
to keep our citizens safe.</i>

569
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,650
Put 'em all down. No warning.

570
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:04,427
<i>To preserve our way of life.</i>

571
00:37:04,747 --> 00:37:08,252
<i>Our hope has always been
that a great peace is on the horizon.</i>

572
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,857
That one day wounds

573
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:11,426
would be healed and salvation

574
00:37:11,736 --> 00:37:12,758
could be found.

575
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,950
<i>I'm here to tell you
that that day is today.</i>

576
00:37:17,976 --> 00:37:20,659
<i>I'm proud to announce
that we have developed a treatment,</i>

577
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,350
<i>a method to reverse the genetic code.</i>

578
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:30,490
The first clinics will open next month
across the world. And soon,

579
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,150
<i>we can begin lifting restrictions.</i>

580
00:37:33,525 --> 00:37:37,050
<i>Cities and families can be reunited.</i>

581
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:39,650
<i>And we can finally live without fear.</i>

582
00:37:41,347 --> 00:37:42,468
<i>We've been vigilant.</i>

583
00:37:43,612 --> 00:37:45,170
<i>We have been uncompromising.</i>

584
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:47,597
<i>And our efforts</i>

585
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:50,149
<i>have paid off.</i>

586
00:37:53,045 --> 00:37:54,274
<i>The nightmare is over.</i>

587
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,203
<i>The world</i>

588
00:37:58,591 --> 00:37:59,646
<i>is saved.</i>

589
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,428
Why are we waiting, sir?

590
00:38:03,577 --> 00:38:05,278
Why can't we just bring
the fight to them?

591
00:38:05,391 --> 00:38:06,398
Because we'd lose.

592
00:38:06,482 --> 00:38:08,640
The Haitian's up here,
so up here, they're powerless.

593
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:11,550
Weapons free. Shoot on sight.

594
00:38:19,495 --> 00:38:21,250
I must go back to stop explosion.

595
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,450
- You know I'm telling truth.
- Hold him down.

596
00:38:23,685 --> 00:38:24,850
Please don't do this!

597
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,252
I'm sorry.

598
00:38:40,342 --> 00:38:41,350
Come on!

599
00:38:44,145 --> 00:38:45,550
You're letting me go. Why?

600
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,980
I think I'm supposed to.

601
00:38:51,785 --> 00:38:53,350
I'll take you where it's safe.

602
00:38:54,145 --> 00:38:55,350
So you can change all this.

603
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,350
No, future me! He's good guy!

604
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:22,182
You need to go back now.

605
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,450
But how do I return to the right moment?

606
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,980
- I don't know how to do that!
- I'll take you.

607
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:51,750
Come on, move it!

608
00:39:56,321 --> 00:39:57,322
Sir.

609
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,287
The Haitian's down! The Haitian is down!

610
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,950
What about Nakamura?

611
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,550
We can't get to him, sir.

612
00:40:07,313 --> 00:40:08,993
Your brother is holding us off.

613
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:11,801
<i>If I don't get reinforcements now,
it's all over, sir.</i>

614
00:40:11,914 --> 00:40:13,150
<i>Nakamura will escape.</i>

615
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:14,950
<i>Mr. President?</i>

616
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:31,161
<i>Bust the door!</i>

617
00:40:42,161 --> 00:40:44,451
Get in here Parkman, end this.

618
00:40:45,806 --> 00:40:46,880
Sir.

619
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:49,014
Move it!

620
00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:53,358
Brother versus brother.

621
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:56,215
It's almost biblical.

622
00:40:56,507 --> 00:40:58,642
My brother can't walk through walls.
Who are you?

623
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:00,572
An old friend.

624
00:41:03,097 --> 00:41:04,848
The guy they blame
for blowing up New York

625
00:41:04,973 --> 00:41:07,047
but you and I know the real story,
don't we, Pete?

626
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,520
Come on, do it!

627
00:41:11,254 --> 00:41:12,418
You must leave!

628
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:13,909
Now!

629
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,008
You're gonna pay
for what you did to Nathan.

630
00:41:16,155 --> 00:41:17,736
What you did in his name!

631
00:41:17,915 --> 00:41:18,935
What I did?

632
00:41:20,518 --> 00:41:23,432
When I killed Nathan he had already
turned against his own kind.

633
00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:24,552
Liar!
