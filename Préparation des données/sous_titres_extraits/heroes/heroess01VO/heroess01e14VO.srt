00:00:00,646 --> 00:00:02,231
<i>Previously, on<i> Heroes...

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,374
My dad lied to me about my entire life

3
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:08,610
My biological parents, my hability,
you can't just hide things like that.

4
00:00:08,682 --> 00:00:10,880
21-year-old woman was killed
in an explosion.

5
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:14,431
Also killed in the fire
was her eighteen-month-old daughter.

6
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:17,584
Hi, I'm looking for someone
related to Meredith Gordon.

7
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:19,880
- This his her.
- Mom?

8
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:21,226
Where are you taking us?

9
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:23,807
Tell your boss
I'm on very important mission.

10
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:34,859
It can take years to integrate
a multiple personnality

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,744
but if you let me, I can help you.

12
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,168
What I am, you can't fix.

13
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:43,634
Who are you? How can you see me?

14
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:45,373
I don't know. I just do what you can do.

15
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:48,005
I'm the Invisible Man,
I'm Claude Raines, now get away from me.

16
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,760
I found you, I need you to help me.

17
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:51,690
The entire city is in danger.

18
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:54,197
You seem pretty sure
about that pending apocalypse of yours.

19
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:56,663
How many people have you taught
before me?

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,401
If he crashes...

21
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:03,959
you bring him back, again, and again.

22
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:06,658
- He's dead.
- Well, that's less an ideal.

23
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:17,529
I don't see how petty theft
is part of my training.

24
00:01:17,548 --> 00:01:18,667
There's a lot you don't see.

25
00:01:18,668 --> 00:01:21,917
You've no idea how to use
these gifts of yours properly.

26
00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:23,914
Yeah, and you do? No, I--

27
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,198
Right now, your abilities
only show up as a reflex.

28
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:27,787
Autonomic, like swallowing.

29
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,032
That's a dog's trick.

30
00:01:29,153 --> 00:01:30,747
Making it a conscious choice, using it,

31
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,485
that's what makes you
more than a poodle.

32
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:34,837
Is insulting me really gonna
help me learn how to do that?

33
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,960
You're the one
who's a bomb

34
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:37,815
set to blow up me
and everyone in this city

35
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:39,760
unless I can get you
housebroken.

36
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,526
That's right,
now he's listening.

37
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:46,957
Now, you absorb all these
abilities you find, yeah?

38
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,545
You're invisible with me, you've flown,
you've read some minds.

39
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:50,966
Yeah, put me in a coma for 2 weeks.

40
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,727
Your body doesn't know
what to do with it.

41
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:55,300
It's gotten jumbled, like file cards
knocking around a shoebox.

42
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:57,699
Except with you, the cards
are dowsed in plutonium,

43
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,405
piling up to a critical mass.

44
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:04,369
Now, I'm gonna teach you
how to pull 'em out, one at a time.

45
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,218
You think that's possible?

46
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,713
I hope so. Next time you shut down,
it might not be just a coma.

47
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:11,019
Might be the day you melt down.

48
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,529
So then, let's get to today's lesson.

49
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:16,008
All right, let's start by seeing
if you can hold on to one of your powers

50
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:17,777
without your benefactors
hanging around.

51
00:02:17,778 --> 00:02:19,453
You think I can do that alone?

52
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:21,299
We're about to find out.

53
00:02:22,504 --> 00:02:23,678
Remember to breathe.

54
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:43,447
God, it sounds like a bomb
is about to go off.

55
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:46,528
I know it's hard. Just focus
on the mirror and try to relax.

56
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:47,742
I can't relax.

57
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:49,802
You're trying to bring her out.

58
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:50,803
Jessica...

59
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:51,861
I told you.

60
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:53,255
She is dangerous.

61
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:54,660
She could hurt you.

62
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:55,661
Show me.

63
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,173
Those cuffs could keep
an elephant in that chair.

64
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:05,370
And just 'cause I'm a shrink,don't think
I don't know how to use that Taser.

65
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:08,028
I thought that the goal
was to get rid of her.

66
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:11,171
The goal here
is to bring your two halves

67
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:12,460
to a healthy middle.

68
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,905
To have a unified
and whole you.

69
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,294
Not two aspects at war.

70
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:22,407
How do we do this?

71
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,852
Like I said,
you focus on the reflection.

72
00:03:25,763 --> 00:03:26,932
And breathe.

73
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:29,975
Come on.

74
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:34,925
Feel free to let
your mind wander.

75
00:03:37,603 --> 00:03:39,754
We used to have a piano
in our home.

76
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,386
You played?

77
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:43,856
Chopsticks, barely.

78
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:47,949
My sister...

79
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,145
Jessica.

80
00:03:50,518 --> 00:03:51,870
She played beautifully.

81
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:57,873
I used to...
play with her sheet music.

82
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:00,680
I didn't...
know what it was.

83
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:03,147
It was just...
dots and lines.

84
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,626
I would...
get out my crayons

85
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:11,022
and connect the dots.

86
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,594
Jessica used to say...

87
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:21,688
that I could turn Mozart into a monkey.

88
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:25,474
I sure did.

89
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:27,213
Jessica.

90
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,295
You should have listened
to the little mouse.

91
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:56,614
How's Claire?

92
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:13,462
That was for the haircut.

93
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:47,853
You shouldn't have built
such a good cage.

94
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:49,837
You go anywhere near her...

95
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,799
You just didn't use your keys this time.

96
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:26,330
I shouldn't have them.

97
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,428
Not anymore.

98
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,654
You started painting
since you got back from rehab.

99
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:34,693
Can I see 'em?

100
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:39,078
That's not done yet!

101
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:44,854
Oh, God.

102
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,021
That's the roof
of my father's building.

103
00:06:50,262 --> 00:06:52,012
We had a lot of good memories up there.

104
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:53,807
Is that how you painted
our relationship?

105
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:55,069
Like a city destroyed?

106
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,322
What are you looking for, Simone?

107
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:02,450
It's Peter. He's still missing.

108
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:04,885
I'm running out of places to look.

109
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,635
You finally believe
I can paint the future,

110
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:09,946
and you want to use it
to find your new boyfriend.

111
00:07:09,983 --> 00:07:12,284
I don't wanna be asking you this either.

112
00:07:13,106 --> 00:07:14,106
Can you?

113
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,060
I have been.

114
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,817
Except it's not working.

115
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:21,915
Every time I try to paint
where Peter is, I get nothing.

116
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,092
You've been trying to find him-- why?

117
00:07:24,272 --> 00:07:25,566
I know what he can do.

118
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:28,023
He's the one that's gonna turn
New York into this.

119
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:29,028
I'm not gonna let him.

120
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:30,471
How do you know so much about him?

121
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:32,112
Because I painted it.

122
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,637
I care about you, Simone,

123
00:07:36,638 --> 00:07:38,696
more than I knew how to say when...

124
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,366
when it would have made a difference.

125
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:43,847
But right now,
I don't care if you hate me.

126
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:46,377
I just want you safe.
Stay away from Peter.

127
00:07:49,214 --> 00:07:50,214
Just...

128
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:52,861
tell me you'll look for him.

129
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,470
I'll try.

130
00:07:58,526 --> 00:07:59,526
Yeah.

131
00:08:02,076 --> 00:08:03,076
Simone...

132
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:06,629
Keep the key.

133
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:26,213
The manatee is on the brink
of extinction.

134
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:27,823
There's one
at the aquarium in Lubbock,

135
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:31,229
and the marine biologist said
we could stop by any time.

136
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,560
You're asking my permission
to skip school?

137
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:36,244
No, if I wanted
to skip school,

138
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:38,948
I'd check into home room
and then sneak out Ms. Robert's window.

139
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:42,175
But you've always stressed honesty,
so I'm being honest.

140
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:45,692
The manatee's a very noble creature.

141
00:08:46,924 --> 00:08:49,075
Is your car in working order, Zachary?

142
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:50,182
Just had the oil changed.

143
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:51,183
Any tickets?

144
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,380
Just parking.

145
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:55,835
You'll be home for dinner.

146
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,788
- Yes.
- That's not a question.

147
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,007
I'm making fajitas.

148
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:01,326
Zach, you're welcome to join us.

149
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,950
Let's go.

150
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:06,351
Come on.

151
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:13,422
We'll wait 15 minutes,
and then head out.

152
00:09:13,423 --> 00:09:15,624
- Do you have the directions to Kermit?
- Yeah.

153
00:09:15,696 --> 00:09:17,688
Look, what if your mom wants proof?

154
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,051
About the aquarium.

155
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,751
Where did you get these?

156
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:26,899
Motel 6 lobby and my color printer.

157
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:33,613
No one can know we're going
to see my real mom.

158
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:36,948
We have to be perfect.

159
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:17,801
Get a doctor!

160
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:19,693
Wait.

161
00:12:19,694 --> 00:12:20,694
What happened?

162
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:32,991
I tried to tell her.

163
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,407
Take me back to my cell!

164
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:37,432
I'd love to!

165
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:41,830
Thanks for almost
getting me arrested.

166
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:44,445
A little more focus, you'd have had
some cash and fresh lipstick.

167
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:46,945
I never said it'd be easy.
In fact, I think I said repeatedly

168
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:49,266
- it'd be crap.
- You've been doing this for 15 years.

169
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:51,503
Cut me a little slack on trying
to do it for 5 minutes.

170
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,137
You'll learn. We just gotta find
what's holding you back.

171
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,513
The cops have my name and address.

172
00:12:55,514 --> 00:12:58,019
I'm pretty sure Nathan's gonna
kill me first anyway.

173
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,326
You worry a lot about your people,
don't you?

174
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:02,691
Your friends, your mother, your brother.

175
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:04,406
No wonder your head's all clogged.

176
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:05,545
You're still sunk under.

177
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:07,385
- Under what?
- Your attachments.

178
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,289
All these people who feed you biscuits,

179
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,374
pat your head, and tell you
you're not fit for the outdoors.

180
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:14,373
You still see yourself
through their eyes?

181
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:15,385
No, I don't.

182
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:17,200
Right, well, I'll bet you 20 bucks

183
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:19,375
your dad didn't make much of you either.

184
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:21,141
God, you're easy.

185
00:13:21,164 --> 00:13:23,013
We've gotta get these people
out of your head.

186
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:26,251
Do you understand? These people are
my family. I can't just cut 'em out.

187
00:13:26,743 --> 00:13:29,902
Peter can't use his powers
without someone holding his hands.

188
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:33,025
How can you not punch that face
every time you see it?

189
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,091
He's not like that.

190
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:36,192
- He is, trust me.
- You don't know him.

191
00:13:36,342 --> 00:13:37,342
I don't need to.

192
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:40,299
I spend a lot of time moving around
people's homes, their bedrooms.

193
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:43,155
You get to know people if you see them
when they think they're alone.

194
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,001
You see 'em for what they truly are:
selfish, deceitful,

195
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:47,002
and gassy.

196
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:49,286
So what is that,
your big truth about the world?

197
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,780
Sooner you learn it,
sooner we get that collar off your neck.

198
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:53,564
People suck, friend.

199
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:56,148
Every last one of them.
Never forget that.

200
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,086
Not all of them.

201
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,844
Oh, right. There's a girl.

202
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:02,493
She's not like the rest of them.

203
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:05,700
Everyone's like the rest.
That's why they're the rest.

204
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:09,312
Fine, let's go and see
what your girl's up to.

205
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:11,351
Then maybe we can clear your head.

206
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,488
Wait, you wanna... spy on her?

207
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:18,869
Look, you can follow her all you want.
I'm telling you, she's not like that.

208
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,046
Well, then, no harm in taking a look.

209
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
This is it.

210
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:34,348
Number 36.

211
00:17:35,877 --> 00:17:37,355
Nice pinwheel collection.

212
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:44,179
You know, I always imagined
my parents would live in a...

213
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,786
penthouse in New York City.

214
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:48,236
Not some trailer park in Kermit.

215
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:52,393
So she lives in a trailer.
Maybe she likes the open road.

216
00:17:52,394 --> 00:17:53,842
Just not what I imagined.

217
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:56,493
Stop imagining. She's right there.

218
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:57,980
What am I supposed to say?

219
00:17:57,981 --> 00:18:00,899
"Hi, I'm your daughter
and I can regrow my kidney"?

220
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:04,357
I mean, what if she's got
burns and scars from the fire?

221
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:05,737
She's supposed to be dead, right?

222
00:18:05,738 --> 00:18:06,973
So are you, remember?

223
00:18:07,683 --> 00:18:09,506
You already got that in common.

224
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:13,117
Hey... where are you going?

225
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,523
I'm getting rid of your exit strategy.

226
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:21,289
You'll be fine.
We'll be back in time for fajitas.

227
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:50,399
Claire?

228
00:19:08,674 --> 00:19:09,732
Hi, little Fluffy.

229
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:13,372
Claire home from school yet?

230
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:16,085
No?

231
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:19,037
We'll just wait.

232
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:22,933
Now, what's your name?

233
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:26,797
Mr. Muggles? Where are you, baby?
Mama's home!

234
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,201
Of course.

235
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,546
Let's go say hi.

236
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:50,505
I'm sorry. Who are you?

237
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:55,848
I just came from the paper factory,
ma'am.

238
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:59,062
I'm just making delivery
for your husband, and I saw...

239
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,963
this little guy...

240
00:20:01,853 --> 00:20:02,853
in the street.

241
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:06,520
Now, somebody must have left
the back door open.

242
00:20:07,157 --> 00:20:08,668
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

243
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:10,490
I took the liberty.

244
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:17,635
Well, aren't you sweet?

245
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,269
And he was just out there, in the yard?

246
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,758
Just chewing-out the sprinkler end.

247
00:20:28,703 --> 00:20:31,751
Who left those doors opened,
Mr. Muggles?

248
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:34,549
Claire or Lyle?
You tell me, so I can tan their ass.

249
00:20:36,696 --> 00:20:38,529
Well, thanks for inviting me in.

250
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:40,786
I always wanted to...

251
00:20:41,268 --> 00:20:43,043
see where Mr. Bennet lived.

252
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:48,493
It is so funny how all of you
call him Mr. Bennet over there.

253
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:52,824
I’ve always known him as--
Stop that you, no more shoes.

254
00:20:53,244 --> 00:20:55,949
Since he discovered shoe laces,
he can't get enough.

255
00:20:57,296 --> 00:21:00,556
That's funny. I never really
imagined him as much as a dog person.

256
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:04,125
I guess he just looms a little larger
when he's drillin' you.

257
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,093
He mostly talks about Claire.

258
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:09,671
I was hoping to meet her, actually.
I've heard so much about her.

259
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:12,362
Well, she has promised
to be home for dinner,

260
00:21:12,536 --> 00:21:13,963
which means half an hour late,

261
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,915
My son is at a tae kwon
sleepover night.

262
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:18,612
That means an extra plate.

263
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,352
Why don't you stay for dinner?

264
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:26,773
Least I can offer my new hero.

265
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:28,857
Are you sure?

266
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,515
It's not too much trouble?

267
00:21:30,554 --> 00:21:33,969
I will call my husband
and tell him to expect you.

268
00:21:34,065 --> 00:21:36,081
What did you say
your name was again, mister... ?

269
00:21:36,082 --> 00:21:37,258
Sylar.

270
00:21:39,438 --> 00:21:41,994
Oh, I don't think you'll reach him
at the office, though.

271
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,705
Last I saw, he was just swamped.

272
00:21:55,393 --> 00:21:57,014
I'm staring, I'm sorry.

273
00:21:59,078 --> 00:22:01,827
I mean, you have to understand.
I never thought this would happen.

274
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:03,736
You, sitting inches away from me.

275
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:07,114
You're so beautiful.

276
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:08,927
Thank you.

277
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:10,394
You're a good student?

278
00:22:12,014 --> 00:22:13,249
I'm okay.

279
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:14,792
Lousy at math.

280
00:22:15,178 --> 00:22:16,587
No help from me there.

281
00:22:17,724 --> 00:22:19,499
Well, I bet you're all kinds of popular.

282
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,158
I was homecoming queen.

283
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,109
- Kinda.
- Damn, I missed so much.

284
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:28,093
Well, if I'd known
you were out there, but,

285
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:30,620
now you must think something awful?

286
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:33,485
I mean, I was so sure that...

287
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:35,780
nothing could have survived that fire.

288
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:38,713
It was a miracle that I did, and...

289
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:41,042
God, when I saw that roof, I...

290
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,433
Don't question the miracle, right?

291
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:50,227
Here.

292
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:52,233
It's a horchata.

293
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:56,709
I learnt the secret recipe in Mexico,
it's sweet.

294
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:01,898
You lived in Mexico?

295
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:04,541
Oh, I've moved around a lot.

296
00:23:06,695 --> 00:23:08,470
After I lost you, I sort of--

297
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:10,689
started running. I never really stopped.

298
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:14,662
And I only came back to Kermit
a couple months ago.

299
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,363
I spend some time in Cuernavaca

300
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:19,003
and La Paz.

301
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,337
You've never been...

302
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:25,126
Sorry.

303
00:23:27,943 --> 00:23:29,120
It's my mom.

304
00:23:30,991 --> 00:23:32,033
Hi!

305
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,040
Yeah, we're at the aquarium right now.

306
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:35,910
They just let Zach
feed him turtle grass.

307
00:23:36,084 --> 00:23:38,708
We're practically on our way.
We'll be home in like an hour.

308
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:40,927
No, I won't let him speed.

309
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,369
She don't know you're here.

310
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:52,993
She doesn't really understand
what's going on with here and now.

311
00:23:54,247 --> 00:23:55,636
Neither of my parents do.

312
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:58,375
Well, I'll pretend I understand
why you're sneaking around.

313
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:01,510
All girls deserve a secret, right?

314
00:24:02,764 --> 00:24:04,809
Seems like I've a lot of them
these days.

315
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:09,652
I have to show you something.

316
00:24:11,562 --> 00:24:13,492
You may understand,
or you may not, but...

317
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,389
I need you to see.

318
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:19,029
See what?

319
00:24:21,672 --> 00:24:23,890
I think I know how I survived that fire.

320
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:28,916
- Claire, don't!
- It's okay.

321
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,301
Please, say something.

322
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:48,898
Some family...

323
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:02,677
I told Claire to get a move on,
she said she'll be back soon.

324
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:04,664
Cheerleader, huh?

325
00:25:04,943 --> 00:25:06,911
Co-Captain, by junior year.

326
00:25:08,281 --> 00:25:11,657
Although, not so much these days, they
dissolved the team because of some...

327
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:14,599
horrible event at the school.

328
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:16,344
I heard about that.

329
00:25:18,158 --> 00:25:20,463
That must have been hard on poor Claire.

330
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:25,522
You are awfully
interested in my daughter.

331
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,995
Ever since I've seen what she can do,
I guess you could say, I'm a...

332
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:31,802
fan. She's really quite gifted.

333
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,280
Oh, you've been to a game?

334
00:25:38,534 --> 00:25:40,193
Yeah, I guess I have.

335
00:25:40,984 --> 00:25:43,376
I just couldn't get over
those irresistible...

336
00:25:45,414 --> 00:25:46,765
talents of hers.

337
00:25:50,122 --> 00:25:51,164
I should...

338
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:54,405
I should check
with my husband again, excuse-me.

339
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:57,106
I'd rather you didn't,
so I can surprise him.

340
00:26:03,623 --> 00:26:05,321
- How did you that?
- I'm special.

341
00:26:06,285 --> 00:26:08,022
Just like Claire, well--

342
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,565
different, but...

343
00:26:09,932 --> 00:26:11,302
you catch the meaning.

344
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,284
It's a shame I've to kill her...

345
00:26:15,326 --> 00:26:16,985
but maybe I'll kill you first.

346
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:20,303
I really haven't decided yet.

347
00:26:47,361 --> 00:26:48,480
Hi.

348
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:01,384
Find him. He dies!

349
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:08,215
I don't understand what happened.

350
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:09,854
Why was he-- He moved...

351
00:27:10,182 --> 00:27:13,115
the phone without even touching it.

352
00:27:14,137 --> 00:27:15,507
You're safe now.

353
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,012
I'm right here.

354
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:19,181
I'll find him.

355
00:27:19,258 --> 00:27:20,840
He kept asking about Claire.

356
00:27:20,994 --> 00:27:22,113
Claire is fine.

357
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:25,528
She's safe too,
and she'll stay that way, I promise.

358
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:32,809
Who is that?

359
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:34,276
This is my friend.

360
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:36,668
He's gonna make everything okay.

361
00:27:37,015 --> 00:27:38,694
He'll help you forget again.

362
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:41,544
Again?
What do you mean again?

363
00:27:41,852 --> 00:27:43,897
It's okay. Hold my hand.

364
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,942
It'll all be over soon.

365
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,616
You could stay a little longer.
Have some dinner.

366
00:28:01,731 --> 00:28:03,873
I can't cook worth crap, but...

367
00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:06,082
Well, I'm supposed to be home
a while ago.

368
00:28:06,178 --> 00:28:09,506
I got six messages from my dad
telling me to come home right away, so,

369
00:28:09,713 --> 00:28:11,198
he sounded pretty pissed.

370
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:14,131
This is no good-bye, you know that?

371
00:28:23,973 --> 00:28:26,461
I was hoping
you could tell me about my father.

372
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,679
That's...

373
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:34,129
complicated.

374
00:28:36,897 --> 00:28:39,000
Why don't you let me work on that
for next time?

375
00:28:42,192 --> 00:28:43,244
Some family.

376
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:47,237
Here.

377
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:48,818
A little something from Mexico.

378
00:28:48,876 --> 00:28:50,516
Oh no, I can't.

379
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:54,056
You can, and you're gonna.

380
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,572
It'll look ten times better on you
than it ever did on me.

381
00:29:36,951 --> 00:29:39,092
We haven't been up here together
in long time.

382
00:29:41,523 --> 00:29:43,472
There's something about this roof.

383
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:45,488
You and I spent a lot of time up here.

384
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:47,949
I mean, it's connected
with what's happening.

385
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:50,403
- It's important somehow.
- Well, it's certainly mysterious.

386
00:29:50,426 --> 00:29:52,934
You know I never figured out
how these pigeons got up here.

387
00:29:53,204 --> 00:29:54,554
My father always said:

388
00:29:54,728 --> 00:29:55,963
"If they found their way,

389
00:29:56,368 --> 00:29:57,593
"we have to let them be."

390
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,433
I know we had a lot together, Isaac.

391
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,729
For a long time.

392
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:10,723
You saw it...

393
00:30:11,206 --> 00:30:12,363
The painting of us.

394
00:30:12,942 --> 00:30:14,717
It's the future, there's still hope for.

395
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:21,178
This city took me in.

396
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:23,859
Everything important
that ever happened to me, happened here.

397
00:30:23,937 --> 00:30:25,017
Good,

398
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:27,351
bad,

399
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:28,914
you...

400
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:33,740
Now, it's all gonna be destroyed
because I can't stop him.

401
00:30:33,817 --> 00:30:35,091
You don't know that.

402
00:30:35,303 --> 00:30:37,309
It keeps coming back.
Worse every time.

403
00:30:37,348 --> 00:30:39,354
You saw
what this looks like after the bomb.

404
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:41,206
The world will never recover from that.

405
00:30:41,303 --> 00:30:42,595
That's not true.

406
00:30:43,531 --> 00:30:44,920
You can't lose hope.

407
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:47,351
What hope is it there?

408
00:30:47,987 --> 00:30:49,144
There's you.

409
00:30:49,337 --> 00:30:50,418
What you can do.

410
00:30:50,495 --> 00:30:53,138
Why else would you be allowed
to see the future unless it was to--

411
00:30:53,157 --> 00:30:54,585
do something about it.

412
00:30:55,472 --> 00:30:57,710
You can't just see the future, Isaac.

413
00:30:57,942 --> 00:30:59,157
You make it.

414
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:01,858
You'll find a way.

415
00:31:02,302 --> 00:31:03,691
You really believe that?

416
00:31:05,526 --> 00:31:06,741
I believe in you.

417
00:33:14,484 --> 00:33:15,622
Get dressed!

418
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:17,011
Dressed for what?

419
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:18,555
You're going home.

420
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:22,317
- It's not possible.
- Oh, it's more than possible.

421
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,114
The charges against you
have been dropped, Miss Sanders.

422
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:26,773
What?

423
00:33:27,236 --> 00:33:29,426
The D.A. throw out the entire case.

424
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:30,718
That can happen.

425
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,458
I killed people.

426
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:34,972
The state of Nevada,

427
00:33:35,165 --> 00:33:37,075
isn't so sure about that anymore.

428
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:40,412
It seems a rather terrible gentleman
on death row

429
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,959
confessed all the crimes
you're accused of.

430
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:45,428
DNA evidence backed-up everything.

431
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,540
Wonderful system, isn't it?

432
00:33:48,523 --> 00:33:50,105
As far as they're concerned,

433
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,957
justice has been served.

434
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:56,134
And as far as Linderman is concerned?

435
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:59,558
Don't worry
about tomorrow's problems today.

436
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:02,879
I need to be in here.

437
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:07,259
- I need help.
- You only need to get dressed.

438
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,497
You're going home.

439
00:34:16,152 --> 00:34:17,464
That's the one you love.

440
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,589
Off to dinner with a guy
she left to be with you.

441
00:34:21,457 --> 00:34:23,077
Sort of fickle, don't you think?

442
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,467
Why would you show me that?

443
00:34:24,534 --> 00:34:26,270
I don't show you anything.
She did.

444
00:34:26,347 --> 00:34:28,392
We just followed her.
Not even very long.

445
00:34:29,665 --> 00:34:31,652
- I'm sorry, Peter.
- No, you're not.

446
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:32,780
You enjoy that.

447
00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:35,037
You got this rosy film
over your eyes, like a kid.

448
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:37,313
It's no wonder
you live like an adolescent.

449
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:39,744
Posters on the wall, hair in your face.

450
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:42,821
You've got to see the world as it is.
The only way you learn to save them.

451
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,827
And what? Be like you, a hermit?

452
00:34:44,965 --> 00:34:46,785
No one knows you alive,
except some pigeons.

453
00:34:46,786 --> 00:34:48,444
You have
to get rid of your distractions.

454
00:34:48,445 --> 00:34:50,653
The people I love
are not distractions.

455
00:34:50,711 --> 00:34:51,810
Then why can't you fly?

456
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,450
You've done it, your body remembers how,

457
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,244
the only thing
standing in your way is you.

458
00:34:55,322 --> 00:34:57,357
What am I supposed to do?
Cut them all of my life?

459
00:34:57,369 --> 00:34:59,987
- How could you expect me to be--
- Did you forget you're a bomb?

460
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:01,698
You've got to remember
what this is about.

461
00:35:01,775 --> 00:35:04,216
Or do you have to ask
for your brother's permission for that?

462
00:35:04,254 --> 00:35:06,964
Anything else that I have to do,
you want to make a list?

463
00:35:07,003 --> 00:35:10,145
You're a sad cartoon of a broken heart,
bleeding all over the place.

464
00:35:10,181 --> 00:35:11,902
I'm just trying
to get your mind straight.

465
00:35:11,922 --> 00:35:14,497
I've followed you around
and listened to your half-assed wisdom.

466
00:35:14,544 --> 00:35:15,780
You don't have any answers.

467
00:35:15,828 --> 00:35:17,149
Okay, you don't know anything.

468
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:19,020
You, are afraid of the world!

469
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,158
You have to listen to me.

470
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:22,145
And I'm tired of you telling me

471
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:24,923
what I have to do.
I don't have to do anything.

472
00:35:25,261 --> 00:35:26,457
Except fly.

473
00:36:13,734 --> 00:36:15,143
Son of a bitch!

474
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:34,152
Not quite I was expecting,
but hope the flowers yet.

475
00:36:37,926 --> 00:36:41,437
You threw me
off a thirty story building!

476
00:36:42,073 --> 00:36:43,829
If I didn't regenerate, I'd be dead!

477
00:36:43,887 --> 00:36:45,334
Or you could have flown.

478
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,382
If you hadn't worked this one out,
you'd have been hopeless anyway

479
00:36:48,517 --> 00:36:50,640
and I'd have
to defuse the biggest bomb ever.

480
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:54,314
But you did it, didn't you?

481
00:36:55,607 --> 00:36:56,996
You cleared your mind.

482
00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:58,713
You called out your power.

483
00:37:06,803 --> 00:37:08,135
Before I hit the ground,

484
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:11,549
when I knew what was about to happen,
I had this flash.

485
00:37:12,475 --> 00:37:13,652
In my head, there was...

486
00:37:13,787 --> 00:37:15,485
the girl that I met in Texas.

487
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,530
This cheerleader, she can heal herself.

488
00:37:18,591 --> 00:37:20,269
My God, she's a sweet kid.

489
00:37:21,436 --> 00:37:23,231
Sad little smile, she just...

490
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:31,075
You were wrong.

491
00:37:33,274 --> 00:37:34,846
I don't have to cut her out.

492
00:37:34,982 --> 00:37:38,203
I have to remember her,
how she made me feel. That's how I...

493
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,307
Oh God!

494
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,139
It's happening.

495
00:37:58,146 --> 00:37:59,284
I'm losing it.

496
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:06,729
Well, it's a start.

497
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:23,328
Peter?

498
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:27,483
- Yes?
<i>- I think I found a way to stop him.</i>

499
00:38:28,274 --> 00:38:30,146
- I found him.
<i>- Sylar?</i>

500
00:38:30,763 --> 00:38:31,949
I thought you had Sylar.

501
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:34,072
I will again... soon.

502
00:38:35,306 --> 00:38:36,946
You mean Petrelli.
Where is he?

503
00:38:37,004 --> 00:38:39,791
<i>I think he's been here this all time,
and I've been painting him.</i>

504
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:42,319
Except no one can see him,
like he's a ghost or...

505
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:45,455
invisible.

506
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:48,253
What does that mean?

507
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:53,211
It means an old friend is not quite
as dead as we thought he was.

508
00:40:03,978 --> 00:40:08,106
Mom, I know it's not our game night,
but can we play a game scrabble?

509
00:40:08,415 --> 00:40:09,862
Since you just got home?

510
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:12,553
Absolutely.
I owe you like a dozen.

511
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:15,138
Just give me a minute, okay?

512
00:40:34,425 --> 00:40:36,026
What are you so mad about, Niki?

513
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:38,033
You're the one
who wanted to be locked-up.

514
00:40:46,565 --> 00:40:47,761
I'm home!

515
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,652
In the kitchen.

516
00:40:53,864 --> 00:40:56,700
You are in big trouble, young lady.

517
00:40:58,841 --> 00:41:00,076
The school called.

518
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,757
Did you think you could ditch,
and I wouldn't find out?

519
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:05,516
Mom, we talked about it this morning.

520
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:07,426
Zach and I went to the aquarium.

521
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:16,127
I think I would remember a conversation
about you skipping school.

522
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:19,646
You okay?

523
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:21,672
Fine, just...

524
00:41:21,884 --> 00:41:24,296
Bang my head on something.
Bit of a headache.

525
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:29,304
Why don't you
let me finish setting the table,

526
00:41:29,343 --> 00:41:31,195
and you can go lay down
for a little bit.

527
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:34,822
Don't think this gets you off the hook.

528
00:42:13,787 --> 00:42:17,221
You might not remember me.
We haven't spoken in a long time, but...

529
00:42:20,974 --> 00:42:22,633
our daughter just found me.

530
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:26,009
Did you hear what I just said?

531
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:28,845
She's alive.

532
00:42:30,205 --> 00:42:31,652
We need to talk, Nathan.

533
00:42:37,391 --> 00:42:38,424
