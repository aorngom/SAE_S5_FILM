00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:02,137
<i>Previously on</i> Heroes...

2
00:00:02,407 --> 00:00:04,380
<i>Ordinary people across the globe,</i>

3
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:06,881
<i>discovered extraordinary habilities.</i>

4
00:00:07,386 --> 00:00:09,734
<i>A single mother lost her son</i>

5
00:00:10,157 --> 00:00:12,748
<i>and gives into her dark side,
to save him.</i>

6
00:00:12,842 --> 00:00:14,098
I did what had to be done.

7
00:00:15,284 --> 00:00:16,564
Like I always do.

8
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:18,678
<i>A new hero is discovered.</i>

9
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:22,111
I remember lots and lots, it's just,
something that my brain starts to do.

10
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:24,906
<i>But meets a tragic fate.</i>

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,974
<i>And another hero
goes back in time to rescue her.</i>

12
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:35,549
<i>Peter solves the mystery of his destiny.</i>

13
00:00:35,665 --> 00:00:36,803
The cheerleader.

14
00:00:36,822 --> 00:00:38,404
We're all trying to help her.

15
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,402
<i>And her father will stop at nothing
to avert catastrophy.</i>

16
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,588
This girl, the one you've painted here,
she's my daughter.

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,771
This man here, he's gonna kill her
tomorrow night at her homecoming game.

18
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:52,182
I need you to paint this painting.

19
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:55,200
<i>Tonight, their destinies will unite them</i>

20
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:59,406
<i>to save the cheerleader
and save the world.</i>

21
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:14,874
<i>We are, if anything,</i>

22
00:01:15,202 --> 00:01:16,494
<i>creatures of habit...</i>

23
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:21,919
<i>drawn to the safety and comfort
of the familiar.</i>

24
00:01:23,437 --> 00:01:24,827
Do they actually believe

25
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,814
that pudding is a vegetable?

26
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:29,949
<i>But what happens
when the familiar becomes unsafe?</i>

27
00:01:30,682 --> 00:01:33,991
<i>When the fear that we have been
desperately trying to avoid</i>

28
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:35,853
<i>finds us where we live?</i>

29
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,377
Something wrong?

30
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:39,980
Jackie just killed my appetite.

31
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:47,670
Oh, the principal's gonna post
the homecoming queen announcement.

32
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:51,586
Well,
aren't you gonna go see if you won?

33
00:01:51,682 --> 00:01:53,944
- What's the point?
- You're a finalist, Claire. Go.

34
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:04,950
Good luck.

35
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:10,011
Kinda nervy for someone in your position
to be running for homecoming queen.

36
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:12,365
My position?

37
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:14,089
You know. Pariah?

38
00:02:14,494 --> 00:02:16,528
You hospitalized the MVP,

39
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:19,948
annihilating any hope of us
actually winning the game.

40
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:24,376
You're not deluded enough

41
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:26,461
to think you're actually gonna win?

42
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:29,907
No delusions. It's a popularity contest,

43
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:32,953
and you've made it very clear
that I am no longer popular.

44
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,917
It's more than a popularity contest.

45
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:38,430
Being selected homecoming queen
is about serving your school.

46
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:39,611
God, Claire...

47
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:41,569
I didn't think you were that shallow.

48
00:02:42,283 --> 00:02:43,500
Congratulations, ladies.

49
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:44,600
Make me proud.

50
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, my God, don't spaz out.

51
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:48,700
What?

52
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:56,122
I can't believe it.

53
00:02:57,156 --> 00:02:58,300
I won?

54
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:11,281
Shut up, you freaks!

55
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:20,281
You didn't tell Peter about me
buying this painting, did you?

56
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:21,411
You asked me not to.

57
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:25,500
I don't get it. What is it?

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,200
It's one of a series,
the work of Isaac Mendez,

59
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,235
a rising artist.

60
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:32,376
Peter believes
Isaac can paint the future.

61
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:34,759
Is it supposed to be Peter?

62
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:36,786
I'm not sure.

63
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:40,123
But Peter thinks he needs to be there

64
00:03:40,435 --> 00:03:41,800
to save a cheerleader.

65
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,700
Union Wells High School.

66
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:50,326
Peter thinks
if he saves a cheerleader...

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,322
he'll save the world.

68
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:55,485
Right.

69
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:58,444
Is that the only copy?

70
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:01,779
Why?

71
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,011
Peter's got all these...
ideas in his head.

72
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,858
Delusions of grandeur.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,312
He thinks he's supposed
to make a difference.

74
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,050
What are you doing?

75
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:25,627
What are you doing?

76
00:04:31,186 --> 00:04:32,349
Saving his life.

77
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,096
What?

78
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,499
You believe it?

79
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,300
Save the cheerleader, save the world?

80
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:44,877
I'm not sure what to believe anymore.

81
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,334
I am.

82
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,162
Nice!

83
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,157
What's the range on this?

84
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,619
The Kinsella 320Z,

85
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:29,200
been known
to pierce body armor at 400 yards.

86
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,947
Military grade.

87
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:32,346
That'll work.

88
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:34,086
Don't want to see his eyes, huh?

89
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:37,600
Must really hate the guy.

90
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:38,862
You have no idea.

91
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,324
He took my son.

92
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:41,741
Damn.

93
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,053
You call the cops?

94
00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:44,400
Cops can't stop him.

95
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:48,100
But I can,
as long as he doesn't see it coming.

96
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:51,542
How much?

97
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:52,857
Two large.

98
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:02,355
We're going hunting.

99
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,532
Capture: FRM@FadeOut - Presync:FRM@Linda
Subtitles: www.sub-way.fr

100
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:20,068
So how long do you plan
on keeping this up?

101
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:21,665
Till you turn around.

102
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,384
I told you, we can't go back!

103
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,000
And I told you mom needs me.

104
00:06:25,294 --> 00:06:26,800
It's not safe with her.

105
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,392
I still love her.

106
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,000
No matter what she does,
a part of me always will.

107
00:06:40,795 --> 00:06:42,300
But your mom has changed.

108
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:45,826
The good news...

109
00:06:46,328 --> 00:06:48,944
is that it's gonna be you and me
from here on out.

110
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:50,563
Partners.

111
00:06:53,032 --> 00:06:54,864
You mean, like Batman and Robin?

112
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,932
Yeah. Like Batman and Robin.

113
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,632
Only... I ain't wearing no tights.

114
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:06,942
You could wear tights.
I'm not wearing tights.

115
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:08,430
Need to hit the head?

116
00:07:08,546 --> 00:07:09,900
Nah, I'm good.

117
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:41,824
Did you ever consider that these dreams

118
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:43,800
that you've been having,
are just that, dreams?

119
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:44,817
It's impossible.

120
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:46,634
They were talking
about my sister Shanti,

121
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:48,142
a sister I never knew I had!

122
00:07:48,297 --> 00:07:50,755
As children,
we absorb powerful archetypes

123
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,424
that we bury in our subconscious.

124
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,885
Your parents were obviously
still grieving over your sister.

125
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:58,245
Freud would tell you the same thing.

126
00:07:58,272 --> 00:07:59,325
What about the boy?

127
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:01,265
The one with the soccer ball?

128
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,449
Yes, how do you explain
his picture being hidden

129
00:08:03,507 --> 00:08:04,965
in my father's desk, huh?

130
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:07,415
He was one of them,
right here in Chennai.

131
00:08:07,565 --> 00:08:10,609
Sanjog Lyer, my father identified
the genetic marker.

132
00:08:10,686 --> 00:08:12,527
It says the boy can enter your dreams,

133
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:15,200
alter your perceptions,
a kind of spirit guide.

134
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:19,103
- You must have seen that file before.
- I have never seen this file before,

135
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:21,212
and I have had
thousands of dreams in my life.

136
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:23,670
These were different.
They were... They were real.

137
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:25,902
We have to find this boy.

138
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,270
Hey, what was so important
you had me meet you over here?

139
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:35,400
That painting you wanted,
Nathan bought it from Linderman,

140
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:36,578
had it shipped here.

141
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:38,085
It's here... Can I see it?

142
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:40,929
There.

143
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:48,559
I don't understand.

144
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:50,331
He said it was to protect you,

145
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:52,276
that you're gonna get yourself killed.

146
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:57,100
Okay, wait a minute.
You saw this painting, all right?

147
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:58,388
You can describe it to me.

148
00:08:58,446 --> 00:09:01,474
You really believe this, don't you?
Save the cheerleader, save the world.

149
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,765
For reasons
I can't begin to understand...

150
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,767
there are people
that are counting on me to do this.

151
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,800
I don't know if I can,
but I have to try.

152
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:22,600
This doesn't make any sense.

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,300
I probably
shouldn't be showing you this.

154
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:31,989
It's a digital image,
it came with the painting.

155
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,330
Is that you, Peter?

156
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,500
I don't know.

157
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:44,387
Maybe.

158
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:48,334
If it's you, then you're gonna die...

159
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:50,597
at 8:12 tonight.

160
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,022
- Don't go, Peter.
- I have to.

161
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:00,341
I have to.

162
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,632
Union Wells High School
is in Odessa, Texas.

163
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:08,599
I took the liberty
and made a phone call.

164
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:10,200
Homecoming is tonight.

165
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:16,021
Thank you.

166
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,095
Look, I don't know
if this is gonna happen.

167
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:21,441
Just come back, okay?

168
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:22,600
I will.

169
00:10:49,092 --> 00:10:51,500
Hi, this is Peter Petrelli,
is this Hiro Nakamura?

170
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,681
No. Ah, he will be right back.

171
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:57,100
- Who is this?
- <i>I'm his friend, Ando.</i>

172
00:10:57,386 --> 00:10:58,621
Ando, right.

173
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,438
Okay, this is very important.

174
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:04,365
You and Hiro
need to get to Odessa, Texas,

175
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,630
<i>as soon as you can,
Union Wells High School.</i>

176
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:08,400
Okay? That's where the cheerleader is.

177
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,160
We are in Texas already.

178
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,943
Midland, at the Burnt Toast Café.

179
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:14,570
<i>It's outside the airport.</i>

180
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:15,765
You are? That's great!

181
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:17,956
Listen, I'm gonna get on a flight,

182
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,100
tell Hiro that I'll be there
before he knows it.

183
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:21,383
Yes, okay.

184
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,707
I will tell him.

185
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:24,584
Good-bye, Peter Petrelli.

186
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
It's gonna be okay, honey.

187
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:57,522
It's useless.

188
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,800
How is that supposed
to help me find Sylar?

189
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:01,396
He's not a vending machine.

190
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,105
You can't just put the drugs in,
pull a lever,

191
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:06,079
and expect a clear response.

192
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:08,365
He's a person.

193
00:12:08,558 --> 00:12:10,800
Your emotions
are impairing your judgment.

194
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:13,200
Maybe, but I'm not the only one.

195
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,850
When he wakes up,
have him paint another.

196
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,675
You think I'm being emotional?

197
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,200
Do you have any idea
what we're up against?

198
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:29,525
Come here.

199
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:34,600
Oh, my God.

200
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,137
Sylar wants to do that to my Claire.

201
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:41,500
I will do whatever I have
to do to stop it.

202
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,365
Isaac can't help us.

203
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:50,038
It was a mistake to do that to him.

204
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:57,016
Go to the high school.

205
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,498
Use the paintings as a guide.
Wait for Sylar.

206
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:00,925
You'll have help.

207
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,734
When the time is right, neutralize him.

208
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:05,900
I'll keep Claire safe at home.

209
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:07,457
No, it's homecoming.

210
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,018
Find Sylar, take him out.

211
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,732
And let me worry about Claire.

212
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:23,602
Congratulations, Claire.

213
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:25,014
Thanks so much!

214
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:27,159
I don't know that girl.

215
00:13:27,235 --> 00:13:28,633
Holla to the queen!

216
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:30,580
Holla back!

217
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:33,600
Everybody who wasn't my friend
is now my friend,

218
00:13:33,635 --> 00:13:36,114
and everybody who was my friend, isn't.

219
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:38,057
Well, it's not a popularity contest,

220
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:39,969
it's an unpopularity contest

221
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:42,100
'cause you rocked the freak vote.

222
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:43,375
I what?

223
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:45,165
Look, everybody who's like Jackie

224
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,665
voted for Jackie, and everybody
who isn't voted for you.

225
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,033
And in this school, the unpopular
vastly outnumber the popular.

226
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:53,080
Made for a good campaign strategy.

227
00:13:55,744 --> 00:13:57,056
You campaigned for me?

228
00:13:58,726 --> 00:13:59,700
Why?

229
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:03,800
You think all this school spirit stuff
is stupid.

230
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:05,300
I never said it was stupid.

231
00:14:05,698 --> 00:14:07,000
I said it's beneath you.

232
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,165
But obviously it's important,
so whatever.

233
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,558
Now you have a little piece
of your old life back, okay?

234
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:16,071
Just don't start acting
like a bitch again.

235
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,800
Look, I got this off of the Internet.

236
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,912
It supposedly has
this really big chapter

237
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:25,150
on spontaneous regeneration,
so I thought it might

238
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:27,922
enlighten you
on the whole Miracle-gro of it all.

239
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,086
What's with you?

240
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,659
You're being so nice.

241
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,248
I've never been this nice to you.

242
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:41,744
I mean, I've been nice,
but I could be nicer.

243
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,263
Then why don't you?

244
00:14:47,863 --> 00:14:49,426
Congratulations, Claire.

245
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:52,683
Is the gay boy your date?

246
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:54,665
You should tell him,

247
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
only one of you gets to wear the tiara.

248
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:12,000
What? That is so unfair!

249
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:14,265
- Hon?
- I've already made up my mind.

250
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:16,175
You are being completely unreasonable.

251
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:18,015
Do you have any idea
what it means for me

252
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:19,400
to miss this game?

253
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,971
You'll survive.

254
00:15:23,431 --> 00:15:25,541
- But dad!
- No, you listen, and you listen good.

255
00:15:25,585 --> 00:15:28,005
As long as you live under my roof,
you will do as I say.

256
00:15:28,063 --> 00:15:30,750
You may not agree, but don't think
for a moment that that matters.

257
00:15:30,924 --> 00:15:32,900
You are not leaving this house tonight.

258
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,200
Is that clear?

259
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:39,000
Crystal.

260
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,710
She's gonna hate you
for a long time on this one.

261
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,721
Let's hope so.

262
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:08,156
What were you thinking?

263
00:16:08,195 --> 00:16:09,524
Do you know how scared I was?

264
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:11,659
Now you know
how it felt when you left us!

265
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:16,500
Micah, what am I supposed to do here?

266
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:18,467
Go back! She needs us!

267
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,400
We've discussed this.

268
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,171
- Your mom...
- Dad, I know she's different, okay?

269
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,405
I see it too.

270
00:16:24,598 --> 00:16:26,507
Something happened to her when you left.

271
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:28,378
It got really bad.

272
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,637
Then, sometimes,

273
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:34,600
she'd show up instead of mom.

274
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:36,000
She?

275
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:39,519
Jessica.

276
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,700
Dad, mom's sick.

277
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,900
She can't help herself.

278
00:16:47,969 --> 00:16:49,200
She can't control it.

279
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:54,564
Does your mom know about Jessica?

280
00:16:56,543 --> 00:16:58,202
No, I don't think so.

281
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,300
Dad, we can't just leave her.

282
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:09,550
If you still love her, you'll help her.

283
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:14,900
You're right.

284
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:25,387
Do you know this boy?

285
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:28,315
You're wasting my afternoon
because of a ridiculous dream.

286
00:17:28,354 --> 00:17:29,511
No one said you had to come.

287
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,420
And who's gonna keep you
from getting killed?

288
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:32,799
This is a dangerous neighborhood.

289
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,517
One look at your fancy shoes
and we'll be running for our lives.

290
00:17:35,552 --> 00:17:36,716
Have you seen this boy?

291
00:17:36,774 --> 00:17:37,900
Come now, Mohinder.

292
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,200
Let's stop this nonsense.

293
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:42,217
Go back to the university,
talk about this like rational people.

294
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:44,041
I am not leaving until I find him.

295
00:17:44,137 --> 00:17:45,365
I know this boy.

296
00:17:45,675 --> 00:17:47,507
For 500 rupees,
I can tell you where he is.

297
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:49,634
This man is a crook, give him nothing.

298
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:51,673
What are you doing?

299
00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:53,092
Where?

300
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:19,791
You came to me in my dream last night.

301
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:21,743
I don't come to anyone.

302
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:23,716
They come to me.

303
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:25,675
Why?

304
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,384
Why do they come to you?

305
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:30,643
They have questions that need answers.

306
00:18:32,225 --> 00:18:33,800
I'm not sure that I have a question.

307
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:36,785
Yes, you do.

308
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,057
I have two paths in front of me.

309
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,276
I need to know which one to take.

310
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:50,013
Which one is my destiny.

311
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:54,261
You already have the answer you seek.

312
00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:01,764
What is it?

313
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:04,017
What's my answer?

314
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:48,026
Excuse me.

315
00:19:49,175 --> 00:19:50,718
When was this picture taken?

316
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,100
Oh, that was Charlie's birthday.

317
00:19:53,263 --> 00:19:54,517
About six months ago.

318
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:57,500
Do you know him?

319
00:19:57,535 --> 00:19:58,917
Hiro? Sure.

320
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:00,705
He and Charlie were tight.

321
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,659
Please, where is he now?

322
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,465
I have no idea, darlin'.

323
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:06,900
He popped out of her life weeks ago.

324
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,065
What's going on?

325
00:20:56,425 --> 00:20:57,899
I'm here to rescue you.

326
00:20:58,464 --> 00:21:00,155
- Let's go.
- I'm grounded.

327
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,065
No one grounds the queen, come on.

328
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,965
Yeah, tell that to my dad.

329
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:05,800
You only get
to be homecoming queen once.

330
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,980
You know what?
You've already cemented your victory

331
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,102
in the eyes of the student body
by punching Jackie.

332
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,764
Plus, if you back out now,
she becomes the queen.

333
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,680
My dad would pitch a fit.

334
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,200
So, big deal. What? He grounds you more.

335
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:20,411
He double grounds you.

336
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,861
Come on, you deserve this.

337
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:27,744
I do deserve this.

338
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,184
And tonight,
you can be my date to the dance.

339
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,437
- Me?
- Sure, why not?

340
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,302
For a million different reasons.

341
00:21:45,196 --> 00:21:47,436
Is it about what Jackie said?
Because I don't care...

342
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,635
I don't care about that,
you think I care about that?

343
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,550
She can call me whatever she wants.

344
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:53,200
I'm not gonna be embarrassed by it.

345
00:21:53,235 --> 00:21:54,333
I know who I am.

346
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,384
I like who I am.

347
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:58,436
I like who you are. I just...

348
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:03,105
I just wish that you liked who you are.

349
00:22:03,797 --> 00:22:07,598
I'm finally realizing
who my friends really are.

350
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,074
And that maybe being different
isn't the end of the world.

351
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:14,895
That's just who I am.

352
00:22:15,587 --> 00:22:16,899
Exactly,

353
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:18,896
you gotta embrace your inner freak.

354
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,249
Because the only thing
that you'll regret

355
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,085
is denying who you really are.

356
00:22:36,036 --> 00:22:37,155
Ando?

357
00:22:40,432 --> 00:22:42,256
Hey, I'm Peter Petrelli.

358
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:43,800
How are you?

359
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,165
So sorry it took forever.

360
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,881
I couldn't get a flight,
and then taxis in this town...

361
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:50,075
We still have time. Where's Hiro?

362
00:22:50,731 --> 00:22:53,200
Hiro traveled back in time
to rescue Charlie.

363
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,125
I told him it wasn't a good idea,

364
00:22:55,198 --> 00:22:57,350
Peter Petrelli might call,
but he insisted.

365
00:22:57,435 --> 00:22:58,579
What happened to her?

366
00:22:58,733 --> 00:22:59,860
She was killed.

367
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:03,170
We were sitting right here.

368
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,965
It happened so fast.

369
00:23:05,478 --> 00:23:06,980
Next thing we know, she was dead

370
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:08,629
and the killer was gone in a flash.

371
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:09,900
Like, Okage.

372
00:23:12,602 --> 00:23:13,644
Boogeyman.

373
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,000
Hiro says maybe it is the same man

374
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:17,813
that is going to attack the cheerleader.

375
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:20,471
I told Hiro, do over, is too risky.

376
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:24,568
But Hiro says
man who is too afraid to use power,

377
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,350
does not deserve to have power.

378
00:23:27,346 --> 00:23:30,105
I know when, and I know where
the cheerleader gets attacked.

379
00:23:30,163 --> 00:23:31,500
I have to stop him.

380
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:35,265
Is this you?

381
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,586
Maybe.

382
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,807
- You have a power, right?
- Sort of.

383
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,042
Super strength?

384
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:43,150
You bend time and space like Hiro!

385
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:47,834
No, I... I kind of
absorb the abilities of others.

386
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:49,772
But only when they're close.

387
00:23:50,922 --> 00:23:53,900
Truthfully,
when I'm by myself, I don't...

388
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:55,897
I'm not really anything.

389
00:24:01,665 --> 00:24:03,015
I've got less than an hour.

390
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:06,100
Okay, it happens at 8:12, I have to go.

391
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:07,957
Coming?

392
00:24:11,037 --> 00:24:12,253
I will wait for Hiro.

393
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:15,866
Without him,
I'm not really anything either.

394
00:24:17,677 --> 00:24:19,230
Maybe you should wait too.

395
00:24:19,313 --> 00:24:20,490
There's no time.

396
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:22,025
I have to save the cheerleader.

397
00:24:22,108 --> 00:24:23,111
But, Peter!

398
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,602
You die.

399
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,430
Where is she? She's gone!

400
00:24:35,788 --> 00:24:36,865
Oh, right.

401
00:24:37,152 --> 00:24:40,702
I saw her and Zach skip out
across the lawn ten minutes ago.

402
00:24:40,835 --> 00:24:42,800
She must have climbed out her window.

403
00:24:43,823 --> 00:24:45,314
Why didn't you try to stop her?

404
00:24:45,372 --> 00:24:48,168
Because she's a good girl,
and she deserves this.

405
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:49,912
You are being way too harsh.

406
00:24:54,048 --> 00:24:55,553
You don't know what you've done.

407
00:24:57,474 --> 00:24:59,600
If you hear from her,
call me immediately!

408
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,472
You're wasting your time.

409
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,700
Freud would tell you
the boy is merely a manifestation

410
00:25:11,735 --> 00:25:13,000
of your subconscious.

411
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:15,149
Nirad?

412
00:25:15,332 --> 00:25:17,200
Haven't we already had
this conversation?

413
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:28,240
No, wait!

414
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,715
You're wasting your time.

415
00:25:35,495 --> 00:25:37,231
Freud would tell you
that the boy's merely

416
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,817
a manifestation of your subconscious.

417
00:25:38,852 --> 00:25:40,522
It was more than a dream, it was real.

418
00:25:40,561 --> 00:25:42,768
This boy can give me the answers I seek.

419
00:25:42,815 --> 00:25:45,300
I'm your friend, Chandra,
but you sound like a madman.

420
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,600
Well, all great thinkers
were said to be madmen

421
00:25:47,635 --> 00:25:49,667
in their time...
Darwin, Einstein, Gandhi.

422
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:51,680
Darwin was not ridiculed
by his university's

423
00:25:51,735 --> 00:25:52,821
biology round table.

424
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:54,538
They weren't even listening.

425
00:25:54,837 --> 00:25:56,473
You're the one who's not listening!

426
00:25:56,608 --> 00:25:58,900
You think you're actually
gonna find these people?

427
00:25:59,212 --> 00:26:01,508
Levitation, spontaneous regeneration?

428
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:05,349
Chandra, I know that Shanti's death

429
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,714
drove you to find answers,
but it is time to let go.

430
00:26:11,496 --> 00:26:13,899
If you persist on espousing

431
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,213
this insanity in your writing
and in your classroom,

432
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,090
they will strip you of your tenure.

433
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:29,002
So be it.

434
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:51,188
I just finished reading.

435
00:26:51,407 --> 00:26:52,596
It's fantastic, Father.

436
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,123
To think that today, all around us,

437
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,500
the evolutionary process
continues so dramatically!

438
00:26:56,535 --> 00:26:57,665
Who told you to read this?

439
00:26:58,476 --> 00:27:00,725
No one, I saw it on your desk,
so I picked it up.

440
00:27:00,783 --> 00:27:02,232
You invaded my privacy, Mohinder.

441
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:04,319
This was not for you to read.

442
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:08,600
Well, I'm sorry, but I think
it's extraordinary, and I want to help.

443
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,500
By using the Human Genome Project,

444
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:12,623
- we can locate these people.
- Not "we"!

445
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:14,500
You can't be part of this.

446
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:17,463
- Why not?
- Because I don't want you to be!

447
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:20,322
I don't understand.

448
00:27:22,281 --> 00:27:25,400
Darwin said a scientific man
ought to have no wishes,

449
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,362
no affections, a heart of stone.

450
00:27:28,164 --> 00:27:29,437
That's me, Mohinder.

451
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:31,181
It's not you.

452
00:27:31,972 --> 00:27:33,200
Go home.

453
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:44,673
You have your answer.

454
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,100
You were trying to protect me.

455
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,465
Heart of stone.

456
00:28:42,736 --> 00:28:44,222
Why did you have a heart of stone?

457
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,796
Heart of stone.

458
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,117
My sister.

459
00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:11,284
You found them.

460
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,665
- Sorry!
- Sorry.

461
00:29:34,966 --> 00:29:37,378
That was my fault.
I wasn't looking where I was going.

462
00:29:38,503 --> 00:29:41,600
Hey, do you... do you know this girl,
Jackie Wilcox?

463
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,308
Yeah, half-time show starts
in about five minutes.

464
00:29:46,365 --> 00:29:47,753
She'll be out on the field.

465
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,215
She's a cheerleader.

466
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,000
Are you a reporter or something?

467
00:29:55,035 --> 00:29:56,154
Alumni.

468
00:29:56,518 --> 00:29:57,791
I'm just curious.

469
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,978
You know, between you and me,
she's not that special.

470
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:08,257
Just your average teenage girl.

471
00:30:09,477 --> 00:30:12,300
She rushed into a fire
and saved a man's life,

472
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:13,834
sounds kinda special to me.

473
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,486
Yeah, you're right.

474
00:30:19,813 --> 00:30:21,028
I'm jealous.

475
00:30:21,891 --> 00:30:23,222
She's our town hero.

476
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,921
Me? I don't win
too many popularity contests.

477
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:29,400
Hey, it gets better!

478
00:30:31,353 --> 00:30:32,390
What?

479
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:33,862
Life after high school.

480
00:30:35,061 --> 00:30:36,300
It gets a lot better.

481
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,852
Half-time, girls!

482
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:37,300
Come on, pump it up!

483
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,315
Will the nerviness never cease.

484
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:50,602
I thought you were grounded.

485
00:31:51,752 --> 00:31:53,100
It didn't take.

486
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:55,975
How's your eye?

487
00:31:56,909 --> 00:31:58,356
Nothing I can't cover up.

488
00:32:01,313 --> 00:32:02,875
There's something I wanna say to you,

489
00:32:02,972 --> 00:32:04,496
cocaptain to cocaptain.

490
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Say it.

491
00:32:10,821 --> 00:32:12,210
I think you're a menace.

492
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:15,407
And I'm not just talking about you
punching me

493
00:32:15,465 --> 00:32:17,510
over your boyfriend, the girlfriend.

494
00:32:17,808 --> 00:32:19,700
I'm talking about you in general.

495
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,329
We used to be BFF's.

496
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:25,416
What happened?

497
00:32:25,474 --> 00:32:27,600
Maybe I've gained some perspective.

498
00:32:28,891 --> 00:32:30,873
I'm tired of trying
to be someone I'm not.

499
00:32:30,912 --> 00:32:33,072
Well, you've been trying
to be me since second grade.

500
00:32:33,111 --> 00:32:34,600
And now you're trying to be me.

501
00:32:36,346 --> 00:32:37,486
How do you figure?

502
00:32:37,525 --> 00:32:39,610
Your little heroic act
of pulling the guy

503
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:41,366
out of the burning train car...

504
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:43,700
wasn't your heroic act, it was mine.

505
00:32:44,411 --> 00:32:45,600
No, it wasn't.

506
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:47,328
I have it on tape.

507
00:32:54,948 --> 00:32:57,840
You know, a good friend of mine
once said it's more important

508
00:32:57,975 --> 00:33:00,900
to be honest with yourself
and happy than popular.

509
00:33:02,555 --> 00:33:03,945
I think he got it right.

510
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:08,202
Really?

511
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,740
Sounds like a loser to me.

512
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,645
Public schools suck.

513
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:19,100
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

514
00:33:31,794 --> 00:33:33,300
Stop it, you're freaking me out!

515
00:33:33,496 --> 00:33:36,264
- I thought I heard something.
- You're imagining it. Let's go!

516
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,901
What is your problem?

517
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:43,702
Don't go that way.

518
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:47,200
- What the hell?
- Jackie, something's not right.

519
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:48,165
No, duh!

520
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,488
We're missing the coronation.

521
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,093
Believe me, if you don't want
to get that homecoming crown,

522
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:53,333
I'm more than happy...

523
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,834
Are you okay?

524
00:35:09,457 --> 00:35:10,702
Run! Go!

525
00:35:13,031 --> 00:35:14,420
Keep going! Run!

526
00:35:28,908 --> 00:35:30,150
Oh, my God.

527
00:36:03,231 --> 00:36:05,300
- Who is it?
- Go, to the stadium, okay?

528
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,651
Find people, find lights.
He doesn't want to be seen.

529
00:36:07,683 --> 00:36:09,187
- What about you?
- Don't worry.

530
00:36:09,226 --> 00:36:10,422
Just go!

531
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:12,300
Go!

532
00:37:14,587 --> 00:37:15,764
You...

533
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,674
How did you...

534
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:28,702
Where is he?

535
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,560
I don't know.
He ran away before I got here.

536
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:35,700
Police. Go get some help, okay?

537
00:37:35,982 --> 00:37:37,583
Okay. I'll be back.

538
00:37:43,068 --> 00:37:44,200
What's your name?

539
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:46,100
Peter.

540
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:48,799
I'm Claire.

541
00:37:49,537 --> 00:37:50,600
Are you the one?

542
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:53,700
By saving you, did I save the world?

543
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,900
I don't know.

544
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,071
I'm just a cheerleader.

545
00:38:14,088 --> 00:38:15,227
Dad.

546
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:17,048
Dad.

547
00:38:21,296 --> 00:38:22,400
It's okay.

548
00:38:22,988 --> 00:38:24,074
You're okay.

549
00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:26,000
Dad, it was terrible,
Jackie, she...

550
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,390
I know, I know.

551
00:38:29,156 --> 00:38:30,526
We have to go back.

552
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,750
We have to go back, Peter...

553
00:38:32,785 --> 00:38:34,442
- No, no.
- He saved my life!

554
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:35,772
He'll be fine.

555
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:37,296
But we can't leave him.

556
00:38:37,446 --> 00:38:38,645
We can't leave him.

557
00:38:38,886 --> 00:38:40,400
He almost died, but then he...

558
00:38:40,593 --> 00:38:43,965
He... we have to go back!
We have to go back!

559
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,899
The police'll take care of everything.

560
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:48,025
Look at you.

561
00:38:49,753 --> 00:38:51,315
You're lucky to be alive.

562
00:38:51,992 --> 00:38:53,419
It's not luck, Dad.

563
00:38:56,528 --> 00:38:58,419
I have something I have to tell you.

564
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:13,630
You don't want to hurt me.

565
00:39:17,848 --> 00:39:19,315
We just need to talk.

566
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:24,941
You can tell me all about yourself.

567
00:39:26,571 --> 00:39:29,638
But first, go to sleep.

568
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:34,287
You need to sleep.

569
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:54,865
That's the guy!

570
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,762
He's the one in the overcoat
the janitor saw.

571
00:39:56,878 --> 00:40:00,045
- Put your hands on your head!
- What the hell? Look at all that blood.

572
00:40:00,103 --> 00:40:01,700
It's not what you think, guys!

573
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:03,254
All right, hands up.

574
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,351
What are you do... It's not me!

575
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,200
He's getting away!

576
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,908
Let's go! Stand up!

577
00:40:22,392 --> 00:40:23,646
Mira called.

578
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,353
She said you turned down her job offer.

579
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:29,140
You're going back to New York?

580
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,100
He did it, you know.

581
00:40:33,428 --> 00:40:35,772
He discovered them.
His theory, it was right.

582
00:40:36,293 --> 00:40:38,261
And that is good news, yes?

583
00:40:39,678 --> 00:40:41,086
Why didn't he tell me?

584
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:44,450
He wanted you to live your own life.

585
00:40:46,034 --> 00:40:48,908
So now that you know about them,
what will you do?

586
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:50,696
Find them.

587
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:52,799
Tell them who they are,
if they don't already know.

588
00:40:52,837 --> 00:40:54,702
Warn them of the dangers they face.

589
00:40:56,175 --> 00:40:57,815
And who will protect you?

590
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,029
Next stop, Vegas.

591
00:41:12,481 --> 00:41:14,700
Dad, we don't need to go back to Vegas.

592
00:41:15,394 --> 00:41:16,667
Why not?

593
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,784
I called Mom.

594
00:41:19,548 --> 00:41:21,380
I told her where we are.
She's on her way.

595
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,365
Micah, get in the car.

596
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:25,600
Now, come on!

597
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,124
Dad, what's wrong?

598
00:41:28,648 --> 00:41:32,300
<i>We are all, at our cores,
the sum of our fears.</i>

599
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:35,863
<i>To embrace destiny,
we must, inevitably,</i>

600
00:41:35,935 --> 00:41:38,453
<i>face those fears and conquer them.</i>

601
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:41,153
<i>Whether they come from the familiar...</i>

602
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:46,183
<i>or the unknown.</i>

603
00:41:58,443 --> 00:42:00,064
My name is Hiro Nakamura!

604
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,922
I'm here to save your life!

605
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,663
Hey, Charlie!

606
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,853
Come over and blow out the candles!

607
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,580
Hold that thought, okay?

608
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:13,900
I gotta go make a wish.

609
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:32,760
