1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,420
Previously on heroes

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,420
Now we know the meaning of the eclipse.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,470
Everyone's abilities have gone away.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,150
You have to get them back.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,200
You have to fix hiro.

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,740
Arthur petrelli erased his memory.

7
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,410
Hiro now thinks he's ten years old.

8
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,360
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

9
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,540
I gotta get outta here. What?

10
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,410
You don't know me

11
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,250
And you don't know what I've been through.

12
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,080
All he has to do is teleport me

13
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,110
To lawrence, kansas.

14
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,590
I just didn't want you to see me like this.

15
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,780
Like what?

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,960
Like this.

17
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,310
No!

18
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,260
Claire!

19
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,520
Why isn't she healing?

20
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,000
Her ability's not working.

21
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,080
We're both so--

22
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,130
Powerless?

23
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,630
We can't take what we want anymore.

24
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,800
Says who?

25
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,990
Claire.

26
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,360
Oh, my god.

27
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,710
Arthur is alive?

28
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,570
You're one of the only people

29
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,690
In the world that can stop him.

30
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,890
I'm not going anywhere until I stop samedi.

31
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,690
The only way to get this guy to come back home with us

32
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,620
Is if we help him stop his brother.

33
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,780
We know all about you, senator nathan petrelli.

34
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,600
Your father warned us you'd come.

35
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,230
Wait, stop. We have to go back!

36
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,740
My brother won't stop until we're dead.

37
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,480
I have no abilities, peter!

38
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,430
I'm completely--

39
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,610
Powerless?

40
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,780
Like there's nothing you can do?

41
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,980
There is nothing I can do.

42
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,180
You said all this happened for a reason.

43
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,100
To test our resolve.

44
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,120
Look, maybe that's a good thing.

45
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,510
Samedi's abilities are gone too.

46
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,700
He's not invulnerable anymore.

47
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,600
That does not make him powerless.

48
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,510
His followers think he's a god.

49
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,300
Then I say we make him bleed.

50
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,470
We show them he's not a god.

51
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,630
Why did you come here, peter?

52
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,870
To find you.

53
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,240
Take you back to stop my father.

54
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,030
Do not lie to me.

55
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,200
I needed to know I could be a hero

56
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,560
Without my powers.

57
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,400
Let's go.

58
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,170
Gsw to the shoulder.

59
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,600
Bp 110 over 82.

60
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,800
Heart rate 128.

61
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,480
We started an iv. D-5-w.

62
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,590
It hurts!

63
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,840
What's your name, sweetheart?

64
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,020
Claire.

65
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,450
Where's my dad?

66
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,580
He's on his way. How long ago were you shot?

67
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,760
It just happened.

68
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,110
It's gonna be easier if you don't lie.

69
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,830
I'm not.

70
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,400
Her whole system's been infected.

71
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,880
Either she hasn't been sick in her whole life

72
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,240
Or you're lying.

73
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,860
You don't want to tell me the truth,

74
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,920
You can tell it to the police.

75
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,730
Is she gonna be okay?

76
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,900
I don't know.

77
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,660
Do you think it's permanent?

78
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,860
What--our powers going away or us?

79
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,720
Both, I guess.

80
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,860
I don't know anymore.

81
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,240
What if it is...

82
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,230
Permanent.

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,830
Then you get exactly what you want.

84
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,050
And what is it I want?

85
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,730
A chance to reinvent ourselves.

86
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,140
Free of powers or perils.

87
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,100
Scary.

88
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,560
And unexpected.

89
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,730
What?

90
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,010
Our powers going away...

91
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,320
Or us?

92
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,290
Come on, let's go, elle!

93
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,690
Come on!

94
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,810
Who's doing this?

95
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,140
Who do you think?

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,770
That's right, run!

97
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,100
I want you to be scared!

98
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,850
Just like claire was!

99
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,690
This ends today.

100
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,140
Hello

101
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,750
My name is Mathan

102
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,460
I am your friend

103
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,720
There is a lot of power in a name.

104
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,470
You shouldn't give yours away so freely.

105
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,880
Some believe that if you know a man's name,

106
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,390
You can possess him.

107
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,590
Others believe that names grant great strength.

108
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,610
Is that why you call yourself

109
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,230
Baron samedi?

110
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,740
So people will worship you like a god?

111
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,790
Is that why you took the title senator?

112
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,340
No!

113
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,340
What are you doing with her?

114
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,340
She's a restavec. She will be sold.

115
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,420
You mean prostitute.

116
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,330
It's not her choice

117
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,450
To decide whether she's happy or sad.

118
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,070
Whether she lives or dies.

119
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,970
I'm not gonna let you do this!

120
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,060
You?

121
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,710
You are just a man.

122
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,540
And I am the god.

123
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,940
So, dr. Suresh, what have you found?

124
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,820
Why aren't our abilities working?

125
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,890
I have checked every imaginable connection

126
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,890
To this eclipse.

127
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,050
The possibilities are too numerous to consider.

128
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,330
Uh, gravity, electron density.

129
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,360
I mean, maybe it really is just a coincidence.

130
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,810
Yeah, you keep talking, doc,

131
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,420
But all I hear is "blah, blah, blah."

132
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,280
If you gave me just an inch to breathe!

133
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,530
You're under a lot of stress.

134
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,860
I understand.

135
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,130
You understand?

136
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,990
You are holding me here against my will

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,390
And I'm finally cured!

138
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,510
Being powerless makes me vulnerable.

139
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,210
You're paranoid.

140
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,570
Very much so.

141
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,760
I think you need proper motivation.

142
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,190
Ow. Stop!

143
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,190
I'm counting on your help, doctor.

144
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,350
Sandra, what is it?

145
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,530
Where are you?

146
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,550
Why haven't you been picking up my calls?

147
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,420
What's happened?

148
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,720
I took claire to the hospital.

149
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,900
I know you told me not to.

150
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:07,820
Is she all right?

151
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,850
No, she is not all right.

152
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,990
They've stabilized her

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,800
But they say her whole system is infected

154
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,270
Like she's never been sick.

155
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,160
You know she is scared.

156
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,040
I don't know what to tell her

157
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,000
And I don't know what to do.

158
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,210
Okay, just...Stay calm.

159
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,950
There are asking a lot of questions.

160
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,500
They called the police.

161
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,640
What am I supposed to tell them?

162
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,430
Tell them what I would tell them.

163
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,670
You mean lie.

164
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,890
I'll be right there

165
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,240
What's going on?

166
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,390
What are those?

167
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,990
Leg braces.

168
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,900
This is me without my abilities.

169
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,280
I have cerebral palsy.

170
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,260
But you're the fastest person in the world.

171
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,320
Last year, I could barely move.

172
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,900
And then there was an eclipse.

173
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,930
And afterwards, I could walk.

174
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,600
And then I could run.

175
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,790
Then I could run really fast.

176
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,720
And now I'm back to where I started.

177
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,550
Read my thoughts if you don't believe me.

178
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,390
I can't.

179
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,860
I can't.

180
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,340
I lost my abilities.

181
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,800
Hiro did too.

182
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,850
We tried to fight arthur petrelli.

183
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,080
He's punishing us.

184
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,220
We don't know if it was him.

185
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,420
I watched him kill your father.

186
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,970
It's right up his alley.

187
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,310
Not like I don't deserve it.

188
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,550
Stop saying that.

189
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,610
Why?

190
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,170
I'm a villain.

191
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,050
A nemesis, right?

192
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,690
You reap what you sow.

193
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,820
How many times do I have to tell you

194
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,830
You are a good person?

195
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,320
You don't know me.

196
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,440
You didn't know about this.

197
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,560
You can't help me

198
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,240
And stop pretending like you can.

199
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,530
Everything all right?

200
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,540
Matt was just leaving.

201
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,650
This gonna give me my powers back?

202
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,420
It'll help track the changes your body's going through.

203
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,120
You really think I'm that kind of stupid, doc?

204
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,100
Honestly...Yeah.

205
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,400
I did.

206
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,500
"dude, this is so awesome."

207
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:01,840
We need the new issue of 9th wonders!

208
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,980
You must help us!

209
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,260
We need the new issue of 9th wonders.

210
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,160
You must help us.

211
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,090
What is this, some kind of practical joke?

212
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,800
What, you think I hired these guys?

213
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,940
I'm ando masahashi.

214
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,280
This is hiro nakamura.

215
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,470
Look!

216
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,770
"how did you know what I was gonna say?"

217
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,350
How did you put this in a comic book?

218
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,710
I didn't.

219
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,340
Dude, this is--dude.

220
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,360
You must help us understand

221
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,530
Why hiro's lost his power

222
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,950
And how to get his memory back.

223
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,040
The world is at stake.

224
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,730
The answers are in these books.

225
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,790
Let's open up some back issue and find out what's going on

226
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,230
This is not a library.

227
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,800
You want if you buy it

228
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:44,580
Then we buy it!

229
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,690
This one too,please

230
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,900
Best.Day.Ever.

231
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,960
It's okay.

232
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,270
May I help you?

233
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,170
No, we're fine. Here.

234
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,970
He's gonna call the cops.

235
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,620
It doesn't matter. You'll be long gone.

236
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,190
What are you talking about?

237
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,010
You've bled a trail of bread crumbs

238
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,720
For bennet to follow.

239
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,520
He's gonna be here any minute.

240
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,570
We have to split up or else he's gonna kill us both.

241
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,340
No, we have to do this together.

242
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,660
That's the point.

243
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,420
With our abilities gone,

244
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,780
Bennet is the powerful one.

245
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,080
He's better trained and he will kill you.

246
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,010
Maybe I deserve it.

247
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,550
Maybe? No, you've changed.

248
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,940
Don't give up.

249
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,220
Do you have a plan?

250
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,280
Let him follow and set a trap.

251
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,690
Numbers are our biggest advantage.

252
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,080
Okay, we do this together.

253
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,240
Come on.

254
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:09,840
You're very pretty

255
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,100
You want to make me happy? Right?

256
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,420
Go, go, go, go, go.

257
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:33,740
My sister...

258
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:34,610
We will save her

259
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:35,630
Run and do not look back

260
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:39,980
You made me bleed

261
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,400
I'm going to do more than that

262
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,410
Are you going to kill me,brother?

263
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,200
It is the only way to stop me

264
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,600
And then I fought a dinasour,but it really wasn't a dinasour...

265
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,050
And then I...

266
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
I know.I was there.

267
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,580
Matt.

268
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,350
Hey, I thought you said you were gonna figure out

269
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,510
Why our powers aren't working.

270
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,650
We are.

271
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,910
In here? Yeah.

272
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,060
Have you found anything?

273
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,030
Actually, I have a theory.

274
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,330
Who are these bozos?

275
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,150
In hiro's origin story,

276
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,940
There's an eclipse.

277
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,650
And there's an eclipse right now.

278
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,150
Coincidence?

279
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,600
There was an eclipse

280
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,880
On the yamagato roof.

281
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,110
The day everything changed.

282
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,530
Yeah, but what does that mean to us?

283
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,350
I think that your powers will come back

284
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,880
When the eclipse ends.

285
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,020
Uh, guys.

286
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,940
You might actually be on to something.

287
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,900
Look at this.

288
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,390
This is a picture of daphne at her house

289
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,490
And she's running.

290
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,830
I gotta get back there before she leaves.

291
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,990
Thanks, guys.

292
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,330
That was matt parkman.

293
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,250
Yeah, I'm matt parkman.

294
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,390
Great news.You're going to get your powers back.

295
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,860
Hen we'll figure out how to get your brain back

296
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,580
No.I don't want to grow up

297
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,760
Not now!Not ever!

298
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,090
I know you can't understand a word I'm saying,

299
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,480
But there's something, um,

300
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,490
I need to confess.

301
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,900
You know, somebody's supposed to be looking out for you.

302
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,460
Somebody's supposed to be protecting you.

303
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,880
Standing up for you.

304
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,300
Somebody like me.

305
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,840
I had power.

306
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,420
I had influence.

307
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,080
And I didn't.

308
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,000
And I'm sorry.

309
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,230
Ready to go home?

310
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,100
They found him. They found him.

311
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,200
We don't have much time.

312
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,190
We need to make a run for it.

313
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,580
No, no, it'll never work.

314
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,410
Look, you-- I'll hold 'em off.

315
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,430
You guys escape. Go.

316
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,050
Give me that.

317
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,610
No, pete--

318
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,850
Stop, you're a senator. You're important.

319
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,170
You need the haitian.

320
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,060
I'm expendable.

321
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,680
Have a little faith in me, okay?

322
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,510
Go.

323
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,650
Go!

324
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,660
Mom.

325
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,180
My mouth is dry.

326
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,410
It's the antibiotics.

327
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,340
You're fighting off an infection.

328
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,650
It hurts.

329
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,000
Here, take this.

330
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,200
Here.

331
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,640
If the pain's too much, press that button.

332
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,440
Where's dad?

333
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,580
He's on his way.

334
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,210
Just try and relax.

335
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,370
You're lying.

336
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,800
You're not very good at it.

337
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,290
He will be here.

338
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,860
I'm so stupid.

339
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,830
All I wanted was for this ability to go away.

340
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,470
And now it's gone.

341
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,880
Mrs. Butler,

342
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,590
We need to talk to you.

343
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,720
You have got to be brave.

344
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,860
I'm not brave.

345
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,160
I'm just a stupid teenager.

346
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,610
I didn't want to be.

347
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,150
I thought I could be more.

348
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,190
I'm sorry I ruined everything.

349
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,770
Claire, don't talk like that.

350
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,850
It hurts.

351
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,270
It hurts so much.

352
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,180
Claire?

353
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,690
Claire!

354
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,810
Help!

355
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,310
Help! Help!

356
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,380
We need help now!

357
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,560
She's coding. Get me a crash cart.

358
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,850
Bring another liter.

359
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,930
Oh, god.

360
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,300
He's here.

361
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,340
This isn't good. It's too open.

362
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,630
Okay, come on.

363
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,770
We'll take this down.

364
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,080
It'll buy us some time.

365
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,930
Wait, what are you doing?

366
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,650
Good-bye, elle.

367
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,180
Gabriel, no!

368
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,020
Gabriel!

369
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,090
No!

370
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,840
Gabriel, no!

371
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,020
She's gone into septic shock.

372
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,600
Crack the chest.

373
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,610
I get it, you're in control.

374
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,570
The agent. The killer.

375
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,440
And I'm defenseless.

376
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,220
What if claire could see you now?

377
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,730
Shut up!

378
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,190
We're losing her! Paddles!

379
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,130
Paddles ready. Charge.

380
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,300
Clear!

381
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,070
Clear!

382
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,940
Clear!

383
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,350
No.

384
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,630
Poor gabriel.

385
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,440
You always wanted to be special.

386
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,400
Look at you now.

387
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,520
No.

388
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,860
You're nobody.

389
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,360
Mom.

390
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,760
We gotta get you outta here.

391
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,630
Daphne?

392
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,020
Mr. Millbrook?

393
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,530
What happened?

394
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,000
She's gone.

395
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,730
Gone where?

396
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,280
I don't know.

397
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,510
No note. No good-bye.

398
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,460
Just gone...Again.

399
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,140
Uh, you okay?

400
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,620
Yeah, I'm fine.

401
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,920
It's all my fault. He's been so good to me.

402
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,750
When she started walking,

403
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,310
I thought it was just...

404
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,120
A fluke.

405
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,360
Maybe if I'd have done more

406
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,820
She would've stayed.

407
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,930
Don't think that.

408
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,930
I gotta go.

409
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,410
I never should have stolen the formula for arthur.

410
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,950
So stupid.

411
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,310
Now everything's screwed up.

412
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,550
Matt's dad is dead. I brought them all together.

413
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,440
I'm as bad as they are.

414
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,260
Horrible person.

415
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,660
You got your ability back.

416
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,900
Well, you could be anywhere in the world right now.

417
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,420
What are you still doing here?

418
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,650
I came to talk to ray.

419
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,530
Does ray talk back?

420
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,820
I made him when I was 13.

421
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,840
This corn is my dad's livelihood.

422
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,320
And one fall, the birds were feasting on it.

423
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,930
We were losing the crop.

424
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,990
Then along came ray.

425
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,280
He saved the field.

426
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,820
No.

427
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,410
You did.

428
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,060
Life just took a lot from you.

429
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,630
You were trying to take something back.

430
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,010
I get that.

431
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,550
We're all flawed.

432
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,400
Powers or no powers.

433
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,620
But when it counts, you're a good person.

434
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,310
I know it and you know that I know it.

435
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,240
So you forgive me?

436
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,200
I'm not the one you need to ask forgiveness from.

437
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,420
You came here for a reason.

438
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,870
To set something right.

439
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,930
Go do it, speedy.

440
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,430
Stop firing

441
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,420
Thanks for coming back.

442
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,580
You got it.

443
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,260
You defeated my men

444
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,040
But,they are just men...

445
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,950
And I'm a God

446
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,660
You should've stopped me when you had the chance

447
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,650
Now...

448
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,400
They will all suffer!

449
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,240
You're not going to hurt anyone else

450
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,770
This isn't your fight.

451
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,060
You made it my fight.

452
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:18,810
Use your ability.

453
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,510
Turn his off. I have a shot!

454
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,630
This is my responsibility.

455
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:25,950
Don't do this

456
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:28,850
You still love me

457
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,300
I'm still your brother

458
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,620
That has no power over me

459
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,040
Maya, it's me, mohinder.

460
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,940
Just a minute.

461
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,430
Mohinder

462
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,540
You gotta get him out

463
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,640
Of my bathroom, man.

464
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,790
What is his problem?

465
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,640
He doesn't want to grow up.

466
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,130
Everyone has to grow up!

467
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,570
Dude!

468
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:45,710
You must grow up

469
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,700
You guys didn't grow up

470
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,380
He says you guys didn't grow up.

471
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,250
You read comic books and eat junk food

472
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,750
You read comic books and eat junk food.

473
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,040
If you were hiro--

474
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,740
You're not, but if you were,

475
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,090
You would know that saving the world

476
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,960
Comes before everything else.

477
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,390
Look what happens when I try

478
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,150
He says, "look what happens when I try."

479
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,340
My father dead

480
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,600
"my father's dead."

481
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:19,890
Why bother being a hero

482
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,760
"why bother being a hero?"

483
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,380
Because you give people hope.

484
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,250
Anybody.

485
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,950
Even lowly office drone can make a difference.

486
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,820
You don't have to be a billionaire like batman

487
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,480
Or an alien like superman.

488
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,670
You just have to believe.

489
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,380
I, uh, thought you didn't believe in any of this.

490
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,630
I don't.

491
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,980
Thank you.

492
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,660
This is really weird.

493
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,470
Did you find something?

494
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,180
Issue one of 9th wonders.

495
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,210
Yeah, this is the issue where, uh, hiro's dad

496
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,650
Gives the baby claire to her father,

497
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,350
Makes him swear to protect her.

498
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,830
You were there.

499
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,090
That's the first and only time

500
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,690
That claire bennet and hiro nakamura met.

501
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,170
What's he saying

502
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,070
That's not the only time.

503
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,560
No, no, kirby plaza doesn't count.

504
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,760
They never actually even talked.

505
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,830
Maybe they did.

506
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,380
Look at this.

507
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,390
In the greenhouse.

508
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,010
That's claire,

509
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,230
And that's hiro

510
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,330
Hiding behind the ferns.

511
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,120
And hiro's wearing the same clothes he is now.

512
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,240
I think hiro has to take claire here

513
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,810
To get his memory back.

514
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,800
You have to take Claire here to get your memory back

515
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,090
How do I find claire

516
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,990
How does he find claire?

517
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,090
I must go there

518
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,610
Right now

519
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:57,730
Wait!Hiro!

520
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,220
Best-day-ever.

521
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,020
Claire bear. You okay?

522
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,040
I needed you

523
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,890
And you weren't there again.

524
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,470
I'm sorry.

525
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,720
There was something I had to do.

526
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,030
There's always something you have to do.

527
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,160
Work's just more important.

528
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,430
No.

529
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,480
Listen.

530
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,810
On the day I was assigned to protect you--

531
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,240
That's right.

532
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,030
I'm just an assignment.

533
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,890
Claire, you know that's not true.

534
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,400
I died!

535
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,980
But I guess that's just old news to you, isn't it?

536
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,380
You died?

537
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,560
When?

538
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,920
Why does it matter?

539
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,400
It matters.

540
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,000
What is it? What's wrong?

541
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:03,730
Where's your mother?

542
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,110
She's with us.

543
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,960
Stay back! Ahh!

544
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,730
We're taking claire with us.

545
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,460
That's what we came for in the first place.

546
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,540
You following daddy's orders now?

547
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,380
You trying to be a good boy?

548
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,370
Not a good boy. Not exactly.

549
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,690
Something else.

550
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,250
Something more like...

551
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,350
Like you.

552
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,320
Home, family.

553
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,500
But not afraid to do the job I have to do.

554
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,920
Stop!

555
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,550
Look, I will go with you, okay?

556
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Just please leave him alone.

557
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,000
I think this game of cat and mouse is over.

558
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,560
They're not your parents.

559
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,090
What are you talking about.

560
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,830
They're manipulating you.

561
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,570
Arthur and angela.

562
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,770
I've read your files, gabriel.

563
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,420
You're not their son.

564
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,290
They're just leveraging your mommy issues

565
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,010
To turn you into their weapon.

566
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,350
He's lying.

567
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,970
Don't let him get inside your head.

568
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,750
You know exactly who he is

569
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,780
Because you helped create him.

570
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,720
And you can't undo that.

571
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,130
Not ever.

572
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,490
You really think you two

573
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,330
Could have a normal life?

574
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,130
He killed your father, elle.

575
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,940
No!

576
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:41,610
Bad man

577
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,660
What the hell?

578
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,260
Save the cheerleader...

579
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,470
Hey.

580
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,090
We got our abilities back.

581
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,420
Where's hiro?

582
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,160
He's gone. Gone where?

583
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,800
No one knows.

584
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,600
Okay, uh,

585
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,070
Let's look in one of your comic books.

586
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,610
No, that well is dry.

587
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,040
Isaac mendez is dead.

588
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,230
This is the last posthumous issue.

589
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,250
But it's not the last story.

590
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,710
What do you mean?

591
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,170
There's a legend I heard from a guy at a convention

592
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:31,000
Who heard it from a dude who heard it from another dude

593
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,790
That one more 9th wonders story exists.

594
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,330
Where?

595
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,350
The day that he died,

596
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,540
Isaac mendez bequeathed his sketch book

597
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,500
To a humble bike messenger.

598
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,190
You find that messenger,

599
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,870
You find your story.

600
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,210
I'll bring the girls back to their parents.

601
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,640
Thank you for what you did.

602
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,690
Nobody should ever have to make the sacrifice

603
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,480
You made today.

604
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,960
You okay? Yeah.

605
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,510
Pete, you've always made your own decisions.

606
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,150
I haven't agreed with all of them,

607
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,940
But they've always come from your heart.

608
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,800
I respect that.

609
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,470
And I'm sorry about--

610
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,420
Just...

611
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,300
Thank you.

612
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,380
It means a lot.

613
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,500
I'm going to pinehurst.

614
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,530
To dad?

615
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,260
It's got nothing to do with dad.

616
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,440
Look, I'm never gonna forgive him for what he did to us.

617
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,670
But his idea, giving people abilities,

618
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,120
The right people--

619
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:56,900
Is wrong.

620
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,560
It's not wrong, pete.

621
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,380
It's so right.

622
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,560
You saw what one man with unstoppable powers

623
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,630
Nearly did to this country.

624
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,690
Yeah, but we stopped him.

625
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,370
We didn't do anything.

626
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,270
He did because he still had power.

627
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,610
And that was just one village.

628
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,720
What about the whole world?

629
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:21,450
Somalia, darfur, bosnia, the middle east.

630
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,500
Murder, genocide.

631
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,590
Don't we have an obligation to try and stop it?

632
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,480
Yes, we do, but not like this.

633
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,990
Then how?

634
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,070
Pinehurst has a way, pete.

635
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,100
It's not perfect.

636
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,030
Not yet.

637
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,590
But if we don't try and stop

638
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,770
What's happening in the world,

639
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,460
Then we're just as guilty

640
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,820
As the people who are committing the crime.

641
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,580
Nathan.

642
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,220
Pete, I can't live with that.

643
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,770
Nathan, you--

644
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,090
Call tk at the embassy.

645
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,050
He'll help you get home.

646
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,780
Nathan, you can't do this!

647
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,360
I'm sorry pete

648
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,670
I think this eclipse showed us all

649
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,680
Exactly who we are.

650
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,310
Desperate.

651
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,940
Angry.

652
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,240
And weak.

653
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,630
Are you ready to get back to work?

654
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,860
Look at me.

655
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,380
Where else could I go?

656
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,570
We'll find a cure.

657
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,630
But that monster inside of you,

658
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,200
That's something you're gonna have to take care

659
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,300
All by yourself

660
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,860
What was that?

661
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,600
Hiro nakamura.

662
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,930
Strange day.

663
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,420
Was bennet lying about my parents?

664
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,740
Of course he was. He's bennet.

665
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,920
He seemed to think you knew something about it.

666
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,530
He's just trying to mess with you.

667
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,030
Sit down.

668
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,400
I've been thinking.

669
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,820
About what?

670
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,640
What you said about finding ourselves free of parents.

671
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,650
Our powers.

672
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,120
What about it?

673
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,310
You were wrong.

674
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,840
Nobody ever really changes.

675
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,820
You did.

676
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,610
I saw you.

677
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,660
That was temporary.

678
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,930
And then I got my powers back.

679
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,480
And I understand now.

680
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,060
And I'm never gonna change.

681
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,590
Neither are you because

682
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,490
We're both just damaged goods.

683
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,990
You're hurting me.

684
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,810
I know.

685
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,190
What did you do?

686
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,830
What the hell is going on?

687
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,780
Dad?

688
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,000
"i don't think I'd be a very good father."

689
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,950
"once again, not a request."

690
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,590
"don't get too close."

691
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,900
Holy sh--
