1
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:12,178
Dad, dad!

2
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:13,728
- Dad, dad, dad!
- Wait, whoa.

3
00:00:13,778 --> 00:00:15,366
Slow down. Slow down. Fire.

4
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,683
Dad, you'll never believe it.

5
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:18,870
I know what I wanna be when I grow up.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,101
A fireman!

7
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,921
I never woulda guessed.

8
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:23,371
What exactly brought this on?

9
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:24,373
Fireman Paul.

10
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:27,061
He came to our school.
He is so totally rad.

11
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,415
Fireman Paul?

12
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:29,711
Did he happen to be sober?

13
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:31,369
Shawn, come here.

14
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:33,148
Listen to me.

15
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:35,413
You...

16
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:37,652
you do not wanna be a fireman.

17
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:38,594
What? Why not?

18
00:00:38,644 --> 00:00:39,621
Because you wanna be a cop.

19
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:41,788
What do you think I've been
teaching you all these years?

20
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:43,831
But being a fireman is the coolest.

21
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:46,030
Being a fireman is not
cooler than being a cop.

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,695
Well, they have cooler uniforms,

23
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:50,225
Cooler trucks, and cooler sirens.

24
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:51,929
They even get to carry axes!

25
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:53,821
Axes? I get to carry a gun.

26
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:55,769
A real gun, with real bullets.

27
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:57,049
I get to shoot bad guys.

28
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,333
I'm like dirty harry.

29
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:00,674
Can you even name a famous fireman?

30
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:02,419
Smokey the bear?

31
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:04,349
First of all, Smokey the
bear is not a fireman.

32
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:05,381
Number two, he's not real.

33
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:07,049
Number three, he's a bear.

34
00:01:07,493 --> 00:01:08,817
He takes his poops in the woods.

35
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:10,117
Is that what you want?

36
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:12,718
Fireman Paul said you'd say that.

37
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:14,684
What is going on in there?

38
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:16,543
She never closes her blinds.

39
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:18,012
You know I don't like
being out of the loop.

40
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:19,317
Shawn, what're you doing?

41
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:20,367
Jules.

42
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:22,254
How 'bout an update on
this blind situation?

43
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:24,562
Oh, just some case with the
fire department or something.

44
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:25,863
Fire department? Did you hear that?

45
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,028
Of course I did. I'm standing
2 1/2 feet away from her.

46
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:29,346
So what's the scoop?

47
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:32,597
Well, apparently some building
burned down last week on Benedetto

48
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:35,152
Under suspicious circumstances
and they're looking for backup.

49
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:36,455
Sorry, guys. I gotta go.

50
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:38,533
Dude, that's us. We're backup.

51
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,914
What?

52
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:43,170
- I strongly believe--
- Excuse us.

53
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,623
We're looking for the fireman.

54
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:46,734
He's probably wearing a
yellow or red hard hat,

55
00:02:46,784 --> 00:02:49,450
Maybe carrying an axe,
possibly a large bucket of sand.

56
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,869
And a Dalmatian.

57
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,917
Discounting your interruption
to a closed-door meeting,

58
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,990
Miss Conrad is the
city's arson inspector.

59
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:57,480
- Arson.
- Miss.

60
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,542
Hello.

61
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:00,211
- Arson. That's fire?
- Yes

62
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:01,602
Shawn Spencer,

63
00:03:01,652 --> 00:03:03,145
Head psychic, SBPD.

64
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:04,513
I'm available.

65
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:05,942
For cases as well.

66
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:07,782
Um, I'm not gonna do that.

67
00:03:07,832 --> 00:03:08,809
I understand.

68
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:09,914
Obsessive-compulsive.

69
00:03:09,964 --> 00:03:11,504
If you're finished, Mr. Spencer,

70
00:03:11,554 --> 00:03:13,128
We'd like to proceed
with our meeting, so...

71
00:03:13,178 --> 00:03:14,437
ah, how rude of me.

72
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:16,429
I'd like to look at the
criminal activity for that area.

73
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,229
- I believe her.
- What?

74
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,991
I'm sensing that lassie

75
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,613
Is skeptical that this is arson.

76
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:23,855
Of course I'm skeptical,
she's an arson investigator,

77
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,128
They always want it to be
arson. Keeps their job viable.

78
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:27,061
Can I go now?

79
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:29,558
All I need is access to some of
your files for the last few years.

80
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:31,196
- I can do that for you.
- What?

81
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:33,483
Come on, chief. I know
where the file room is.

82
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,508
Besides, when you get down
there, things can get tricky,

83
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:36,768
Some of those drawers stick.

84
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:38,844
Who gave you access to the file room?

85
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:40,756
Irrelevant and immaterial.

86
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:42,098
Chief, you're not gonna
let him do that thing

87
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:43,792
Where he only uses
courtroom jargon, are you?

88
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:44,885
Mr. Spencer--

89
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:47,981
He is making a mockery of these
proceedings. All I'm saying is that...

90
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:50,119
She is making a very
compelling argument.

91
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:51,059
You're an idiot.

92
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:52,778
That's less compelling. Move to strike.

93
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:54,248
- Please remove him.
- Good.

94
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:56,262
Sidebar, miss Conrad.

95
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:58,412
I think I can help you.

96
00:03:58,462 --> 00:03:59,595
You have no idea why I'm here.

97
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:01,730
I'm sensing something
happened on Benedetto street

98
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,522
And you're not getting the support
you want from your department,

99
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:05,746
And you're looking for a
little outside assistance.

100
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:07,543
That's actually spot-on.

101
00:04:07,593 --> 00:04:08,726
Yes, I know.

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,456
Chief, I believe we have a match
Made in heaven.

103
00:04:17,443 --> 00:04:18,541
Crap.

104
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,196
This place is like, completely burned.

105
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:21,459
It's called a fire, Shawn.

106
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:24,329
And it's all evidence,
so don't touch anything.

107
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:25,319
All right.

108
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:26,883
I'll try to speak slowly.

109
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,011
Let's review.

110
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:30,726
I believe the fire started
in this general area,

111
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:32,741
And spread in this direction.

112
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:33,924
Conrad.

113
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,256
What're you doing here?

114
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:37,292
Now you're dragging the cops down here?

115
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:38,276
And this is...

116
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,700
Army Johnson,
Fire Prevention Bureau.

117
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,972
And your supervisor, in case you forgot.

118
00:04:43,022 --> 00:04:45,457
- Well, if this is arson, then--
- Look. At the bureau,

119
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:47,516
We have a policy of
supporting our rookies.

120
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:48,366
Rookies?

121
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:51,195
So I gave you a lot of
latitude on this case.

122
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:54,275
I read your report, and I
surveyed the scene myself.

123
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:57,600
It looks like an accidental
fire to me, not malicious arson.

124
00:04:57,705 --> 00:04:59,546
I respectfully disagree.

125
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:00,682
Honey,

126
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,671
The last time this city had an arsonist

127
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:05,777
Was so long ago I was
still on the big, red truck.

128
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:08,954
Besides, this building
had no fire insurance.

129
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:10,273
So no one profits.

130
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:11,680
A firebug doesn't need a motive.

131
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,850
Yeah, enough.

132
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,997
Just finish your report.

133
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,145
Now I'm late for my hot yoga class.

134
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:19,907
I'm teaching this year.

135
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:23,955
An accident?

136
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:26,174
Is there something we're missing, here?

137
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:29,681
Well, we did find some empty
liquor bottles and cigarette butts

138
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:30,994
Around the fire's
point of origin, but--

139
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:32,594
And we've had several reports

140
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:34,508
of teenagers looking
for places to party.

141
00:05:34,558 --> 00:05:36,290
I think lassie's on to something.

142
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,575
Have we ruled out teenagers
who meet in abandoned buildings

143
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,789
And make banas foster?

144
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,842
It is not teenagers.

145
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:43,767
One of the firemen remembers smelling

146
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:46,074
A distinct sweet odor
while putting out the fire,

147
00:05:46,124 --> 00:05:49,397
And that is a sign of a
stronger accelerant than alcohol.

148
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:51,060
And if this is a firebug,

149
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,764
He is just getting started.

150
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:54,867
Dude.

151
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:57,271
That wall over there
doesn't have any insulation.

152
00:05:57,568 --> 00:05:59,177
I think that's an external wall.

153
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:01,607
Look, if no one from your
department is on board,

154
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:03,399
I'm on board!

155
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,490
Gus, what's happening to me?

156
00:06:13,452 --> 00:06:14,727
What the hell are you doing?

157
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:16,662
There's something off
with this wall right here.

158
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:18,085
I can feel it.

159
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:22,214
- Oh, my god.
- What the...

160
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,044
did not see that coming.

161
00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:27,931
Miss Conrad, this wasn't just arson.

162
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:30,383
It was murder.

00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:34,328
He didn't burn to death. M.E.
Pulled a .22 slug out of his sternum.

181
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:35,545
He was shot, then burned?

182
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:38,075
It's sad, but that's what they
do to guys who wear girdles.

183
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,662
This man is the reason the fire was set.

184
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:42,677
According to the M.E.'s
preliminary report,

185
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:45,086
The bullet entered the body
at a downward trajectory,

186
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:47,299
Based on bone fragments
containing lead residue.

187
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:50,300
See, so from behind and
downward means our shooter

188
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,673
Dropped him down on his knees,

189
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:54,113
Popped him execution style. Bang.

190
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:56,789
You trim that fingernail,
Ming the merciless.

191
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,599
Then the killer torched the building
to make the body unidentifiable.

192
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:02,553
Or to remove any trace of
his own fingerprints or DNA.

193
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:04,918
We couldn't even pull a print
off the bullet. Smart move.

194
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:05,875
In case you missed it, detective,

195
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,773
this is my "I told you so" face.

196
00:08:08,246 --> 00:08:10,578
Which is kind of hard
to distinguish from your

197
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:12,435
"I thought this was gonna be
a new episode of law and order

198
00:08:12,485 --> 00:08:14,032
But turns out it's a repeat" face.

199
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:15,471
A dead body changes things.

200
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:16,767
That's his e-mail signature.

201
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:19,855
So, we're on board. And because it's
a homicide, it's our investigation.

202
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:22,489
No, it's arson. And I've already
briefed Army on all of this.

203
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:25,432
He says it's my case, I'm
on point, you report to me.

204
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:28,245
Look, when we find our murder,
you'll find your arsonist.

205
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:30,823
No, when I find my arsonist,
I'll find your murderer.

206
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:32,714
- No.
- Guys, please.

207
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:36,015
Can't we come up with a term that
covers both killer and arsonist?

208
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:37,669
How about arsassin?

209
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:41,312
The skeleton had trace
amounts of methylbenzene

210
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,751
the primary component of TNT.

211
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:46,040
You can get it at any hardware
store, and it has a sweet odor.

212
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:47,601
All right, fine. But no one

213
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:49,589
Outside this room can know
we recovered a skeleton.

214
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,000
And make sure the city treats
the site like an accident,

215
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,155
- All right? I want our killer--
- Arsassin!

216
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,975
- Or karsonist.
- Arsassin.

217
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:58,885
I want the killer to feel safe,

218
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:00,945
I want him to think
that his plan worked.

219
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:02,311
Secondly,

220
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:05,664
The key to solving this case is
to figure out who this guy was.

221
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:08,944
Come here often?

222
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,572
You know, you could afford
to slow down a little.

223
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:17,379
You walk any faster, you're
gonna travel through time.

224
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:18,783
So what's our next move?

225
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,573
Well, I assume we're
gonna team up, right?

226
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,332
Travel cross-country solving mysteries,

227
00:09:22,382 --> 00:09:24,117
Maybe set up shop on
the side of the road,

228
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,434
Form a bluegrass trio.

229
00:09:25,484 --> 00:09:28,697
Look. I appreciate you guys getting
the cops to take this seriously,

230
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:30,440
But you don't have a lot
of experience with this,

231
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,152
So I prefer to handle point alone.

232
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:33,004
You know,

233
00:09:33,054 --> 00:09:36,319
Sun Tzu says that teamwork
can be very sensual--

234
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:39,360
I'll e-mail you the rest!

235
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,799
I'd go after her if she wasn't
walking at cougar speeds.

236
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:44,715
Right. So what're we
doing? Are we really done?

237
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:46,956
Gus, don't be William
Zabka from back to school.

238
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:49,011
We need to get in with the
firemen that put out the fire.

239
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:49,812
Shotgun on fire pole.

240
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,582
You can't call shotgun on a fire pole.

241
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,956
And why them?

242
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:54,462
I think we're looking for a fireman.

243
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,931
Someone who knows fires
someone who knows the system.

244
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:58,165
They started the fire somewhere else,

245
00:09:58,215 --> 00:09:59,638
Then moved the flames
towards the victim.

246
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:02,471
Because the first thing an
arson inspector looks for

247
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:04,004
Is a point of origin.

248
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:04,886
Okay.

249
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:06,224
How in the world do you know all that?

250
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:09,394
I rode the back draft ride at
universal studios like 74 times.

251
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:11,908
Shawn, you can't base a
whole theory on a movie.

252
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:12,945
There's a movie?

253
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:24,366
Now, when we get in here, don't do that
thing you used to do when we were kids.

254
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,689
Hi, fireman.

255
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:27,157
Help you?

256
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:28,996
Shawn Spencer.

257
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,289
Hunting an arsonist.

258
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,762
Step Anthony, Wally Ali.

259
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:32,996
Cat stuck in a tree.

260
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:36,119
Conrad told me about you. The psycho.

261
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:37,735
Psychic.

262
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:39,998
But before we get down to business,

263
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,013
Is fireman Paul around?

264
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:43,815
We heard he used to work
outta here back in the day.

265
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:46,401
We just wanna say hello. He came
to our school when we were kids.

266
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:47,605
No, we're sure he'd rember us.

267
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:50,810
Gus accidentally peed on
him, and I gave him impetigo.

268
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,349
Over here.

269
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:56,018
Died fighting the Renkel fires of '98.

270
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:58,088
Set by a bunch of vandals.

271
00:10:58,138 --> 00:10:59,590
So you think it's arson, too.

272
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,116
You been canoodling with Conrad?

273
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,614
Is Conrad a canoodler?

274
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:05,286
Did she say anything about me?
Can I get her note through you?

275
00:11:05,336 --> 00:11:07,826
I'm not sure I like random
people interrogating my men,

276
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,839
Especially based on psychic hokum.

277
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,034
Hokum?

278
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:13,937
Well, that "hokum" found traces
of methylbenzene at the scene.

279
00:11:13,987 --> 00:11:15,440
- Really?
- Yeah, so

280
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,354
My colleague would like to try and
glean more "hokum" from your men.

281
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:22,107
Listen, it's been a long day,
my shift is over. Manetti!

282
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:23,506
Manetti's my right-hand man.

283
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:26,043
These guys are here about the
fire. Deal with it, would ya?

284
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:30,320
So. You were the guys who
put out the fire a week ago?

285
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:31,359
That was us.

286
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:32,396
Thanks to Manetti, here.

287
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:33,579
Well, that's a given.

288
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:35,659
You don't look old
enough to operate a hose.

289
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:38,566
We doused that fire in 33 minutes.

290
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:39,574
Really?

291
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:41,799
You know, domino's can still
get you a pizza in under 30.

292
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:43,032
That might be more impressive.

293
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:44,856
Yeah? Well, you should've seen how fast

294
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:47,336
I booked the perps back in my cop days.

295
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:49,772
Wow, well we're police-affiliated too,

296
00:11:49,822 --> 00:11:51,207
So can we ask you a few questions?

297
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:53,337
We don't have time.
Starting traing drills.

298
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:55,470
Perfect. We're supposed
to do them with you.

299
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,460
Really?
Who told you that?

300
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,114
Yeah, it sounded weird
to us too, but it's

301
00:11:59,164 --> 00:12:01,250
Imperative that we get this
information as soon as possible,

302
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,048
It's a headquarters thing.
Look, between you and me,

303
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,529
There's nothing we'd rather do less,

304
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,676
So why don't you just grab us a couple of
these costumes and we'll get it over with.

305
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:10,593
You mean uniforms.

306
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:11,917
I've heard it both ways.

307
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:13,292
Can I ring the bell?

308
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:18,773
Move! Move!

309
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,376
Come on! Come on! Get moving downhill!

310
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:25,883
This way! You're going
down hill! Move it, move it!

311
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:28,434
So how many people did
you pull out of the fire?

312
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:29,597
None! Building was empty.

313
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:31,619
Keep moving! Move it!
Move it! Go, go, go!

314
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:35,364
Did you notice anything weird about
the fire besides the smell? Oh!

315
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,541
Lotta open spaces. No furniture
cluttering up the joint.

316
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,398
Hey! This isn't a picnic!
Move! Go, go, go, go!

317
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:50,930
Nope, I didn't see anyone
suspicious in the crowd.

318
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:55,228
I questioned him already, Shawn.

319
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:57,096
Dude, he was doing the pole.

320
00:12:57,146 --> 00:12:58,875
Did anyone miss their shift that night?

321
00:12:58,942 --> 00:12:59,790
No.

322
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,012
No one wants to lose out on the O.T.

323
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:03,532
Anybody here with a criminal record?

324
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,158
Shh! No talking. It kills the illusion.

325
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,438
How much more of this do I have to take?

326
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:11,392
Man, in order for him
to stay certified in CPR.

327
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:13,261
He has to practice on a live person.

328
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:15,342
He's gonna use a tongue guard
when he gives you mouth-to-mouth

329
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:17,092
- So it's not even really like kissing.
- What?

330
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:19,279
If you find yourself becoming
aroused, don't beat yourself up.

331
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:21,047
You must be outta your damn mind.

332
00:13:24,797 --> 00:13:25,929
Everybody move it!

333
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:28,071
This isn't part of the drill, let's go!

334
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:29,438
No, Shawn.

335
00:13:29,488 --> 00:13:31,678
The arsonist might still be
there. And we're already geared up.

336
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,070
They won't even know
I'm driving the truck!

337
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,929
We should stay here. Get some gelato,

338
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:36,129
And read the fire department's reports

339
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,927
from the comfort of
our not-on-fire office.

340
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:39,089
Dude, if we go,

341
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:41,550
You can drive behind
a speeding fire truck.

342
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:43,203
All right. Repeat after me:

343
00:13:43,253 --> 00:13:44,753
We are not going into
a burning building.

344
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,627
We are not-not going
into a burning building.

345
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:47,485
Break!

346
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,445
Hey!

347
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:05,859
Thought you said your shift was over.

348
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:08,342
I heard about it on my scanner.
What is this, Halloween?

349
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:09,269
Why, you got candy?

350
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,135
I'll take some good & plenty.
Or good & fruity.

351
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,189
How bad is it in there?

352
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:14,198
I haven't been inside. I'm
patrolling the scene from out here.

353
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:15,684
So just try to stay
outta the way, all right?

354
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:17,845
This is command. First floor is secure.

355
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:20,436
I'm sending more men to the
second floor. Alpha side over.

356
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:24,007
No, Shawn, we're not going into
a burning building. You promised.

357
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:25,445
- Actually, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

358
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:26,338
The first floor is secure.

359
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:27,996
Those things flare back up all the time.

360
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:29,751
And you know how fire's attracted to me.

361
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:30,767
Can you blame it?

362
00:14:30,817 --> 00:14:32,000
Man, look at you.

363
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,614
Blair Underwood can't
touch you right now.

364
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,367
Blair Underwood never
played a fireman, either.

365
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,411
Exactly. Come on. I
need the super sniffer.

366
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:38,903
Shawn!

367
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:41,474
This is not a good idea, Shawn.

368
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:42,767
Shawn!

369
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:45,636
Dammit.

370
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:47,433
I-I don't know.

371
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:49,945
Maybe we
should try, uh--

372
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,869
Gus, where are you?

373
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,659
Down here!

374
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,646
The key is to stay underneath the smoke!

375
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:56,964
Would you get up?

376
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:01,336
Start sniffing!

377
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,783
There's something sweet in the air!

378
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,868
I need to see what the ceiling
looked like before it was scorched!

379
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,526
Anything else?

380
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:22,310
Nope.

381
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,807
We're good.

382
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,826
In all the years of fighting fires,

383
00:15:32,876 --> 00:15:35,975
That was the dumbest
thing I have ever seen!

384
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:39,050
If I was still a cop,
I'd put you both in jail!

385
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:43,246
I definitely smelled something.

386
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:45,548
This fire was not an accident.

387
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:48,002
I'll do you one better.

388
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:50,484
The chief had flakes of the
unburned ceiling in his hair.

389
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:53,063
He was in there before the fire started.

390
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:54,844
We've found our arsonurder.

391
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,633
What?

392
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,642
Firearsmen.

393
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:02,831
Senor pantalones de fuego?

394
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:12,369
Your psychic hunch was right, Shawn.

395
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:15,738
This body was found in a wall
space at the site of the fire.

396
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:16,576
Yes.

397
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:18,261
I could sense that
the fires were related,

398
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,510
And since the first one
was set to cover up murder--

399
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,206
There might be a body
at the second fire too.

400
00:16:23,145 --> 00:16:24,285
Nice work.

401
00:16:24,486 --> 00:16:25,707
I'm sorry?

402
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:27,514
It was either "nice work" or "ice fork,"

403
00:16:27,564 --> 00:16:28,490
But I couldn't tell which.

404
00:16:28,648 --> 00:16:30,023
According to the M.E.’s report,

405
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:33,705
There's a unique purple rubber
melted in between the victim's toes.

406
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:36,441
- Unique how?
- It has real specks of gold in it.

407
00:16:36,491 --> 00:16:38,501
They think it came from
the victim's sneakers.

408
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:41,403
Purple and gold specks.
That's jet jaguars.

409
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:42,498
Gus owned them.

410
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:45,725
They're the ugliest and most
uncomfortable sneakers known to man.

411
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:47,209
I had a pair. They weren't that bad.

412
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:49,464
They were proven to cause polio.

413
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:51,631
I have elongated metatarsals
and inverted phalanges, Spencer,

414
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:52,628
I have to wear whatever fits.

415
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,398
Well then you know they
were only sold in '98,

416
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:55,884
And then discontinued immediately.

417
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:58,170
The victim was wearing
ten-year-old sneakers?

418
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,973
Who holds onto tennis
shoes for that long?

419
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:02,008
Especially painful purple and gold ones?

420
00:17:02,058 --> 00:17:04,033
If this man was wearing them
at the time of his death,

421
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,308
Then he was definitely killed in '98,

422
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,713
Possibly by the fashion mafia.

423
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:09,212
Ten years ago, that makes no sense.

424
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,472
Why would someone hang
onto a body for a decade

425
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:12,863
And then burn it to a crisp?

426
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:13,987
Unless...

427
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:15,986
the bodies have been
there the whole time.

428
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,297
Just rotting for ten
years? That's your theory?

429
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:21,243
Actually, come to think of it,
both buildings were built in '98.

430
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:23,404
An empty construction site is
a good place to kill someone,

431
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:25,454
And it'd be easy to slip
a body behind the drywall.

432
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:26,816
What...

433
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:29,034
you're sure you're not a germaphobe.

434
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:32,127
All right, let's just confirm the
sneaker thing, and if Spencer’s right,

435
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:34,843
Let's get a list of all the buildings
that were built ten years ago.

436
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:35,721
What?

437
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:37,527
You can just get a list
of that kind of stuff?

438
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:40,549
I'd like a list of all
available Zoltar machines.

439
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,724
For a little 14-year-old
friend of mine.

440
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,318
Thanks, Jules.

441
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:46,702
So, miss Conrad.

442
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:49,769
Anything else I should
know about the second fire?

443
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:51,263
Just that the
firefighters caught a break

444
00:17:51,313 --> 00:17:53,656
Because there wasn't sufficient
ventilation on the top floor.

445
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:56,526
Without the oxygen, the men had
no trouble putting out the fire.

446
00:17:56,872 --> 00:17:58,830
- Yeah, that was us.
- Thanks to Manetti, here.

447
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,200
We doused that fire in 33 minutes.

448
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:03,846
So both fires went
out relatively easily.

449
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:05,087
I guess, yeah.

450
00:18:05,725 --> 00:18:07,516
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

451
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:09,789
I will bet every penny
I have that I'm not.

452
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,986
The arsonist made the
fires easy to put out.

453
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:15,994
Have you at all considered
that this is an inside job?

454
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:18,428
Well, this building wasn't insured
either. The owners don't get anything.

455
00:18:18,478 --> 00:18:20,052
Inside your department.

456
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:22,189
A firefighter?

457
00:18:26,928 --> 00:18:28,447
What're you doing?

458
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:31,033
Do you see a bruise on my
chest from all that CPR?

459
00:18:31,154 --> 00:18:32,795
All I see is chocolate with hair on it.

460
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,241
You know the rules, Shawn.

461
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,202
No sliding down the
pole while I'm not here.

462
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:37,546
But you are here. You're right here.

463
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:38,549
You know what I mean,

464
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:41,265
Especially when I'm stuck
tailing fire chief Dan all day.

465
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:43,242
And they don't even have
a Dalmatian here, Shawn.

466
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:44,789
Would you stop with
the Dalmatians already?

467
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:48,172
I'm just saying it'd be nice to
see one in his natural habitat.

468
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:50,548
They're not indigenous
to firehouses, Gus.

469
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:51,872
Did you find anything out or not?

470
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,246
Well, I hid in a corner while
he got a picture framed  of him,

471
00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:56,017
- John Denver, and the Muppets.
- Muppets?

472
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,650
- Hey, Gonzo's was the shot, boy.
- What?

473
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,134
Sounds productive.

474
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:01,167
Then I just had to stand
around while he spent an hour

475
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:02,779
Figuring out what type
of rotiller to buy.

476
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:05,031
Well, it's not an easy
decision, Gus. After all,

477
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:06,225
It's harvest season, pa.

478
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:07,483
Jeb can't work the plow.

479
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,747
You know he ain't been right since
he come down with the consumption.

480
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:11,041
Will you stop, Shawn?

481
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:12,434
It did get interesting.

482
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,006
He's our guy, and I know it.

483
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:15,500
He was on his cell phone constantly.

484
00:19:15,657 --> 00:19:17,607
And I think I heard him
ask about the accelerant.

485
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,673
After that,

486
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:20,749
He came rushing back here in a panic.

487
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:09,446
Dude. It's sabotage.

488
00:20:09,496 --> 00:20:13,004
He's making it harder for
the men to put out the fires.

489
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:17,304
We gotta stop him.

490
00:20:24,352 --> 00:20:25,836
He's heading to the all-purpose room.

491
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:27,613
There's only one exit to that room.

492
00:20:27,663 --> 00:20:30,051
Here's the plan: we corner, we confront.

493
00:20:30,101 --> 00:20:31,389
He confesses?

494
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,607
We get samosas.

495
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:33,519
Bet.

496
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:37,275
Dude, is that really necessary?

497
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:39,153
I don't play with killers, Shawn.

498
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:50,170
Hello, children.

499
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,173
Yes!

500
00:20:53,223 --> 00:20:56,095
Field trip to the old fire station.

501
00:20:56,145 --> 00:20:57,157
What're you two doing?

502
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:59,515
We are here to help with the lesson.

503
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,001
Clearly.

504
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:03,605
So, uh, kiddies,

505
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:06,663
Always rember to put out your cigarettes

506
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:08,369
When you're finished smoking them.

507
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,279
Uh--
Excuse me?

508
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:11,818
Uh, I mean,

509
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:13,663
Don't smoke.

510
00:21:13,713 --> 00:21:15,054
Uh, in bed.

511
00:21:16,302 --> 00:21:17,896
Or in restaurants.

512
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:20,095
Or in...

513
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,321
- caves?
- No smoking.

514
00:21:22,371 --> 00:21:23,941
Absolutely no smoking.

515
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,947
And don't listen to anyone
who says that a pipe is cool,

516
00:21:26,997 --> 00:21:29,739
Because I'm telling you, it is not.

517
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,796
Get out. Get out. Get out!

518
00:21:33,548 --> 00:21:34,796
Well, that was a waste of time.

519
00:21:34,846 --> 00:21:36,860
Or was it?

520
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:37,840
What is that?

521
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,227
I accidentally mixed up fire
chief Dan’s phone with mine.

522
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:42,564
They're similar shapes, and my
hand was in his jacket pocket.

523
00:21:42,614 --> 00:21:43,691
You stole his phone?

524
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:45,255
He was throwing
us out--

525
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,894
Gus, I plead the third.

526
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:48,141
The third amendment is no soldier

527
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:49,537
can live in your house
against your will.

528
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:51,763
- You mean the fifth.
- I've heard it both ways.

529
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,958
What other ways have you heard it?

530
00:21:53,008 --> 00:21:54,313
Just look at this.

531
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:57,616
Five calls in a row to hardware
stores all over the city.

532
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,502
Where one might go to buy methylbenzene.

533
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,563
That's what I'm talking about.

534
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:04,281
Fire chief Dan?

535
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:05,168
Honestly?

536
00:22:05,302 --> 00:22:07,805
That's why you brought me
down to this death trap?

537
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:08,679
Death trap?

538
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:12,236
This office is in violation of almost
every fire safety code on the books.

539
00:22:12,921 --> 00:22:14,748
Not to contradict, but

540
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:16,788
We are 100% up to code.

541
00:22:16,957 --> 00:22:18,704
I don't walk into a
building unless it's safe.

542
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:20,414
Much less work in one.

543
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:23,487
Your smoke detector is a paper
bowl with an M&M stuck to it.

544
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:26,862
Shawn, where's the Ryerson smoke
detector I bought for the office?

545
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,983
Oh, that thing? It kept
beeping during seance week.

546
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:30,758
Where is it now?

547
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:32,984
Charleston chew?

548
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:34,154
Charleston chew.

549
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,646
You also have an overloaded socket,
and a hotplate on the ground.

550
00:22:37,696 --> 00:22:39,704
I like soup. I won't apologize for that.

551
00:22:39,754 --> 00:22:41,626
It's next to a stack of old newspapers.

552
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,718
I also like to read while I eat.

553
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:45,941
Can you please just tell
me why you think it's Dan?

554
00:22:46,162 --> 00:22:48,251
Well, it's not like I stole
his cell phone or anything.

555
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:50,236
'Cause I mean I don't
do that sort of thing.

556
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:52,345
Although I'm sensing someone
did, I'll solve that later.

557
00:22:52,395 --> 00:22:55,100
No, this, this was just deeply-rooted

558
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,932
Psychic vibage.

559
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:58,860
I know it's hard to believe.

560
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,806
No. Actually it's not.

561
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:02,284
It kinda makes sense.

562
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:03,753
He never thought it was arson,

563
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:05,898
And he hated it when
I questioned his men.

564
00:23:06,557 --> 00:23:07,609
What did the cops say?

565
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:08,494
We haven't told them.

566
00:23:08,774 --> 00:23:10,225
We thought you'd like to make the bust.

567
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:12,383
After all, this is your case.

568
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:16,670
That--

569
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,632
I mean, to
say that--

570
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:22,299
I mean, that-- That
you would think of me.

571
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:24,395
That-- You
would do that.

572
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:28,326
This seems like a great
opportunity for a hug. C'mere.

573
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:30,177
No?

574
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:33,131
- Rotator cuff.
- Right.

575
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:35,454
There's been another fire.

576
00:23:35,504 --> 00:23:37,256
With another body?

577
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,712
Forensics is on the way.

578
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:45,381
Another body. You were right.

579
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:47,799
As a courtesy, I want
to let you know my office

580
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:50,644
Is going to be bringing in
Dan Trombly for questioning.

581
00:23:50,823 --> 00:23:52,159
- The fire chief?
- Correct.

582
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:54,079
That could be a problem.

583
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:55,124
Why?

584
00:23:55,174 --> 00:23:56,470
Because...

585
00:23:58,015 --> 00:24:00,462
that skeleton wasn't
the only body we found.

586
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,866
Lift that, please.

587
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:12,605
It says here that the fire
chief died of asphyxiation.

588
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:14,403
Smoke inhalation.

589
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:16,989
Oh, I'm getting something.

590
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,302
How much more of this
do I have to endure?

591
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:22,536
Do you see the bruise on
my chest from all that CPR?

592
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:25,695
There was someone else there. They
tried to give him CPR before he died.

593
00:24:25,745 --> 00:24:27,000
Maybe someone who knew him.

594
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,015
Of course they knew him. It's
like practically kissing him.

595
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:31,088
What the hell was the fire chief
doing there in the first place?

596
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,404
I mean, I don't think
he started the fire.

597
00:24:32,454 --> 00:24:33,592
He wasn't wearing any protective gear,

598
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:35,527
There weren't any traces
of accelerants on him.

599
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:36,855
We got a break.

600
00:24:36,905 --> 00:24:39,070
The latest skeleton is still
too burned to get an I.D.,

601
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,339
But our killer didn't know that

602
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,233
our victim had an iced in his body.

603
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:43,869
Ew. They make those for men?

604
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,269
It's like a pacemaker.

605
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,460
Tracked the serial number back
to central coast components

606
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,780
Who sold it to Saint Mary's

607
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,186
Who implanted it into
our victim 12 years ago.

608
00:24:51,236 --> 00:24:52,488
Okay, what do we know about our victim?

609
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:54,069
Wait, our skeleton was a criminal?

610
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,330
That's right. His name
is Steven J. Renkel.

611
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,848
As in the kid from Family Matters.

612
00:24:57,898 --> 00:24:59,867
- No.
- As in the Renkel fires of '98.

613
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:01,673
- Yes.
- Guys, bring it in.

614
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:03,763
So our victim is a firestarter himself?

615
00:25:03,813 --> 00:25:07,633
Yeah, they were a bunch of vandals who
liked going around and starting fires.

616
00:25:08,205 --> 00:25:11,333
These are Renkel's
only known accomplices.

617
00:25:15,092 --> 00:25:16,329
Whoa.

618
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:17,674
Oh, I'm getting something.

619
00:25:20,092 --> 00:25:21,604
The second victim is in
one of those pictures.

620
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:22,793
What? How do you know that?

621
00:25:22,843 --> 00:25:23,789
He's telling me he was murdered,

622
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:25,578
He's saying it poorly 'cause
he speaks with a whisth-le.

623
00:25:25,628 --> 00:25:27,755
A whithle, like thith,
he thpeakth like thith.

624
00:25:27,805 --> 00:25:29,991
Which would be endearing on an
eight-year-old, maybe Terry Thomas,

625
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,133
Or the original
supermodel Lauren Hutton.

626
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:34,691
But this, this just
screams for adult braces.

627
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,950
Any form of simple orthodontia,
really, it's not that expensive.

628
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,691
You're saying it's the guy
who has the gap in his teeth?

629
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:40,567
Don't say "gap."

630
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:42,641
He prefers "tooth
alley," but yeth, it ith.

631
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:43,900
I remember these guys.

632
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,397
They all disappeared
around the same time.

633
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:46,883
We figured they'd just skipped town.

634
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:47,833
That's it!

635
00:25:47,883 --> 00:25:49,527
The third victim is up there as well.

636
00:25:49,577 --> 00:25:51,872
He's not speaking because he's afraid
you'll criticize his appearance,

637
00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:53,434
Just like you did with tooth gap boy.

638
00:25:53,484 --> 00:25:54,493
Look, now you got me doing it.

639
00:25:54,543 --> 00:25:57,471
Someone must've hunted them down
and killed them ten years ago.

640
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:58,954
And now they're burning
off the evidence.

641
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,748
It's a long time to
wait to clean up a mess.

642
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:02,843
You should see how long it takes
Gus to clean his cereal bowl.

643
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:05,122
Only one guy in the crew
Has been a suspect

644
00:26:05,123 --> 00:26:07,057
in other arsons since the Renkel fire.

645
00:26:07,207 --> 00:26:09,434
And that's Bodie Lambert.

646
00:26:10,097 --> 00:26:13,259
All right, so why is Bodie the
only one we're still hearing from?

647
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:14,969
Maybe he turned on his partners.

648
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:16,583
Happens all the time.

649
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:17,622
This could be our killer.

650
00:26:17,672 --> 00:26:18,795
Furder.

651
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:19,772
What?

652
00:26:19,822 --> 00:26:21,577
Fire murderer.

653
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:22,991
Furder.

654
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,066
Put a bolo on him, asap.

655
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

656
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,580
you're gonna issue these guys bolo ties?

657
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:31,167
It stands for "be on the lookout."

658
00:26:34,737 --> 00:26:37,909
What are you doing? Army will kill you
if he sees you messing with this stuff.

659
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,592
Well, why are we here?

660
00:26:39,642 --> 00:26:41,098
The cops are following the bodies.

661
00:26:41,148 --> 00:26:42,701
I thought we'd take a different avenue.

662
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:43,807
The buildings.

663
00:26:43,857 --> 00:26:45,131
What do we know?

664
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:47,042
They're all commercial and industrial.

665
00:26:47,092 --> 00:26:48,402
And...

666
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:50,034
they were all built in the same year.

667
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:51,098
After the Renkel fire.

668
00:26:51,148 --> 00:26:52,195
Correct.

669
00:26:53,342 --> 00:26:56,265
Lotta open spaces. No furniture
cluttering up the joint.

670
00:26:58,398 --> 00:26:59,883
Also.

671
00:27:00,445 --> 00:27:02,045
They seemed to be abandoned.

672
00:27:02,095 --> 00:27:03,469
Yet none of them are for sale.

673
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:05,182
Why would three different owners

674
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:07,979
Leave valuable real estate
like that sitting around empty?

675
00:27:10,344 --> 00:27:11,391
What can I do for you guys?

676
00:27:11,441 --> 00:27:13,643
We need to see your files on
the three burned buildings.

677
00:27:13,693 --> 00:27:16,892
Sure, just fill out
requisition form ig88,

678
00:27:16,942 --> 00:27:17,885
You can get 'em upstairs.

679
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:19,573
Army, that will take
forever. We really need to s--

680
00:27:19,623 --> 00:27:22,487
Paperwork is paperwork. It's
the basis for civilization.

681
00:27:22,537 --> 00:27:25,397
Just fill out the forms, I'll
give you everything you need.

682
00:27:26,736 --> 00:27:27,985
Fire alarm.

683
00:27:28,035 --> 00:27:28,955
We'd better evacuate.

684
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:32,239
All right, everybody outta
here. I gotta go deal with this.

685
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,506
Good thing we had a plan b ready.

686
00:27:46,687 --> 00:27:48,312
You smell like a peach meadow.

687
00:27:48,362 --> 00:27:51,340
That's the incense I used to
set off the smoke detector.

688
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,658
You didn't just pull the fire
alarm? It's right there on the wall.

689
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:56,895
Uh, that's a crime, Shawn.
I remain not culpable.

690
00:27:56,945 --> 00:27:59,239
I didn't set off the
detector. The smoke did.

691
00:27:59,626 --> 00:28:00,663
Who burned the incense?

692
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:01,641
I plead the fifth.

693
00:28:02,363 --> 00:28:04,259
Element, dimension, beatle?

694
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:06,194
You can't plead "Billy Preston."

695
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:07,457
All right, what're we doing?

696
00:28:07,507 --> 00:28:10,108
Bring up the burnt buildings.

697
00:28:10,158 --> 00:28:11,311
Okay.

698
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,790
Here we are.

699
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:15,955
Dude.

700
00:28:16,005 --> 00:28:18,173
All these buildings
have "SR" next to 'em.

701
00:28:18,223 --> 00:28:20,181
That stands for "seismic retrofit."

702
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,691
It applies to any building built in '98.

703
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:27,170
Looks like all the safety codes
were just changed last week.

704
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,817
Right before the first fire.

705
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:30,170
That's why they're all empty.

706
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:32,517
They're no longer
considered earthquake safe.

707
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:35,117
They're gonna open up the
walls to bring them up to code.

708
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:38,244
Dude, that's it. That's what
started this whole thing.

709
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:40,683
The killer realized that the
bodies he stashed in those buildings

710
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:43,623
Ten years ago are gonna be discovered,
and now he's torching the evidence.

711
00:28:43,673 --> 00:28:46,046
There's, like, 20 buildings
scheduled to be retrofitted.

712
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:47,414
Lemme print out the list.

713
00:28:47,464 --> 00:28:48,642
Well, step it up.

714
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:51,531
We still have a few minutes before
they let anybody back in the building.

715
00:28:51,716 --> 00:28:53,284
Dude, trust me.

716
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:54,938
You wanna hurry.

717
00:28:58,727 --> 00:28:59,925
You coulda pulled me outta there.

718
00:28:59,975 --> 00:29:01,508
Dude, I gave you two full warnings.

719
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:02,589
My underwear's soaked.

720
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:03,845
- Just like old times.
- Kiss my--

721
00:29:03,895 --> 00:29:04,712
Guys.

722
00:29:04,762 --> 00:29:07,498
One of those buildings is gonna
be targeted next by the arsonist.

723
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:08,348
Are you sure?

724
00:29:08,385 --> 00:29:11,938
I'm al b. Sure watching Diane
Schuur apply sure roll-on.

725
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:14,029
While viewing the sure thing.

726
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,009
That's pretty sure.

727
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:16,297
It's all-day sure.

728
00:29:17,296 --> 00:29:20,209
You are a strange person,
but extremely effective.

729
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,303
See? A little teamwork
isn't the worst thing.

730
00:29:22,654 --> 00:29:24,063
Psychically, I could sense

731
00:29:24,113 --> 00:29:26,673
That there was information in
that office that we need, so, uh,

732
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,843
We'll go check with the cops
while you scope those out.

733
00:29:32,957 --> 00:29:34,667
Carpal tunnel.

734
00:29:34,717 --> 00:29:36,130
Hey!

735
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:38,731
That's fair.

736
00:29:39,932 --> 00:29:40,864
Hey.

737
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:42,227
We got a hit on that bolo.

738
00:29:42,277 --> 00:29:44,202
Sheriff in Barstow found Bodie Lambert

739
00:29:44,252 --> 00:29:46,317
Holed up in a motel 6
under one of his aliases.

740
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,731
Excellent.

741
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:48,678
Dobson!

742
00:29:48,728 --> 00:29:51,604
Get a hold of Barstow pd, tell
'em not to make a move without us.

743
00:29:51,654 --> 00:29:54,563
He is mine.

744
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:01,319
Police!

745
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,981
Clear.

746
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:06,045
O’Hara, you got anything?

747
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,901
Nothing here. All clear.

748
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:09,960
Do these things come in different sizes?

749
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,145
Because my movement is very constricted.

750
00:30:12,195 --> 00:30:14,274
I feel like it's creating
all the wrong lines.

751
00:30:14,324 --> 00:30:16,323
Maybe if they were v-necks, or lapels.

752
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:17,278
Or epaulets.

753
00:30:17,328 --> 00:30:19,427
- What're they doing here?
- I may have given them a heads-up.

754
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,485
It wasn't exactly an invitation.

755
00:30:21,535 --> 00:30:24,065
Well, he must've bolted out the
window. He's not gonna get far.

756
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:25,850
Aerial two, you got
a twenty on the perp?

757
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,672
- You called in air support for this?
- Of course I did.

758
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:29,432
'Scuse me.

759
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:32,132
If I may.

760
00:30:32,418 --> 00:30:35,354
- What're you doing?
- Uh, you might wanna stand back.

761
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,751
Freeze!

762
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,432
Put your hands behind your back.

763
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,580
He's not talking.

764
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,609
I sense that he's superstitious.

765
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:03,006
He might talk to someone
from a higher ethereal plane.

766
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:05,200
May I have a shot?

767
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,702
Knock yourself out.

768
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,847
Gimme a second. I have to go outside
and get something off the ground.

769
00:31:14,238 --> 00:31:15,305
Hey.

770
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,834
Shawn Spencer.

771
00:31:19,884 --> 00:31:21,988
Psychic interrogator.

772
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:24,444
Maybe you remember me from
when I apprehended you?

773
00:31:24,494 --> 00:31:26,023
Remember back then?

774
00:31:26,073 --> 00:31:28,601
No? That's okay.

775
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:30,531
I got everything I need.

776
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:32,564
Have fun in prison. Word to the wise:

777
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:34,719
Don't drop the bar of soap.

778
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:37,071
Oh, please. Don't try
that routine on me.

779
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,540
No, literally, man. Don't drop the soap.

780
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,559
There's so much
bacteria on those floors.

781
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:44,470
I'm pretty sure they only
issue one bar a month, so...

782
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:45,938
why are you eating that?

783
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:48,399
Raw leaves is what the earth
mother allows me to eat.

784
00:31:48,623 --> 00:31:50,763
It banishes all negative entities.

785
00:31:50,964 --> 00:31:51,953
What, are you a fairy?

786
00:31:52,216 --> 00:31:54,534
Hardly. I've seen little
darlings like, 11 times.

787
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,622
But I am a male wiccan.

788
00:31:57,672 --> 00:31:58,508
You're not wiccan.

789
00:31:58,558 --> 00:31:59,937
I'm level eight, jack.

790
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:02,828
I'd be level nine if it wasn't
for my seasonal pollen allergies.

791
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:04,133
What's your coven?

792
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:05,250
Say what?

793
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,767
What's your passphrase?

794
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:10,687
I don't know you, man.

795
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:13,603
Same time. One, two, three.

796
00:32:13,737 --> 00:32:14,924
- Gardnerian.
- Knight rider.

797
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:16,246
Wait, what?

798
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:18,140
Gardner...rarian.

799
00:32:19,294 --> 00:32:21,582
Exactly what you said, man.

800
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:25,088
It is so dope

801
00:32:25,138 --> 00:32:27,085
To connect with other weirdos.

802
00:32:27,135 --> 00:32:29,209
But right here, man, you and me?

803
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:31,294
We understand each other.

804
00:32:31,344 --> 00:32:32,903
All that fairy stuff aside,

805
00:32:33,374 --> 00:32:34,451
I dig you, Bodie.

806
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:37,373
I...dig...Bodie.

807
00:32:38,697 --> 00:32:41,327
Now, I only got a minute before
the cops come in and haul you out,

808
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:43,037
So I'm gonna level with you.

809
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:47,260
The earth force mother is
pretty P.O.'Ed at you, man.

810
00:32:47,576 --> 00:32:48,900
Me?

811
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:50,711
You're crazy. I didn't do anything.

812
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,799
She sent me here to stop you.

813
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:54,985
How do you think I found
you in that ceiling, bro?

814
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:56,473
Luck? No.

815
00:32:56,523 --> 00:32:57,927
I got a message.

816
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,882
Why is the earth spirit after me?

817
00:32:59,932 --> 00:33:02,669
She knows you lit those fires, bro.

818
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:05,807
We found the crewmates you
murdered in the buildings.

819
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:07,244
I didn't kill nobody, brother.

820
00:33:07,294 --> 00:33:08,812
It must've been that guy.

821
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,476
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait,
wait, wait, what guy?

822
00:33:12,965 --> 00:33:14,402
Ten years ago,

823
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:16,413
Somebody started hunting us down.

824
00:33:16,691 --> 00:33:18,476
Someone grabbed me outta my car.

825
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:20,322
Took me to some construction site.

826
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:21,866
Made me get on my knees.

827
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,511
Told me I had to pay for
killing those two firemen.

828
00:33:24,642 --> 00:33:25,891
Then he pulls the trigger.

829
00:33:25,941 --> 00:33:27,262
Nothing happens.

830
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,601
I get the hell outta there.

831
00:33:31,532 --> 00:33:33,620
I haven't been to Santa
Barbara since that night.

832
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:36,014
I found Wicca.

833
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:37,920
And reformed.

834
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,827
Where'd this mystery man take you, bro?

835
00:33:41,105 --> 00:33:42,629
Like, an address or something?

836
00:33:42,964 --> 00:33:44,982
Had a bag over my head most of the time.

837
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:47,495
But that night is burned in my mind.

838
00:33:47,545 --> 00:33:49,412
I was about to die,

839
00:33:49,622 --> 00:33:52,363
And all I remember hearing is birds.

840
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,949
Lots of them.

841
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:56,191
Sounded like hundreds.

842
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:58,977
Birds.

843
00:33:59,027 --> 00:34:00,913
Yeah. Chirping.

844
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,370
Wicca out, brotha.

845
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,456
Shawn, I still can't believe 
the police thought

846
00:34:14,506 --> 00:34:16,596
your bird-chirping clue was too vague.

847
00:34:16,646 --> 00:34:19,917
Well, they're still trying to figure
out what building Bodie was taken to.

848
00:34:20,423 --> 00:34:21,249
Hey.

849
00:34:21,299 --> 00:34:23,287
Well, at least Bodie told
us the killer's motives.

850
00:34:23,337 --> 00:34:26,460
Someone is avenging the deaths of the
firemen killed during the Renkel fires.

851
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,721
Maybe it is a firefighter.

852
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:30,133
I warned you, Shawn.
Firefighters are trouble.

853
00:34:30,183 --> 00:34:32,229
I did everything in my power
to keep you off the pole.

854
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:35,902
And you succeeded, dad,
in every conceivable way.

855
00:34:35,952 --> 00:34:38,086
But, since our bad guy
was targeting criminals,

856
00:34:38,136 --> 00:34:40,320
Rogue cop is now added to the list.

857
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,499
Look, we have all the
potential arson targets.

858
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:44,885
Since our killer scouted
one out for Bodie,

859
00:34:44,935 --> 00:34:46,241
He may have still used
them for other victims.

860
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:49,054
And all you got going
on is your bird chirping.

861
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:50,163
Wait a minute.

862
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,664
What about Mrs. Mugglesworth?

863
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,531
- My cockatoo when I was eight?
- Yeah.

864
00:34:53,581 --> 00:34:55,281
Wow. I haven't thought
about her in years.

865
00:34:55,331 --> 00:34:57,094
Remember when she died, your
parents fed you some story

866
00:34:57,144 --> 00:34:58,291
About taking her somewhere?

867
00:34:58,341 --> 00:34:59,590
The bird sanctuary.

868
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,467
But she's not dead. She's still there,

869
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,576
Living amongst other
relinquished avians.

870
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:06,087
Gus, have you seen her since
your parents took her there?

871
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,033
Of course not.

872
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,482
She had a rare bird disease

873
00:35:08,532 --> 00:35:10,802
Where she would lose her feathers
if anyone ever looked at her.

874
00:35:10,852 --> 00:35:13,679
So she has to be kept in
a special mirrored cage.

875
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:14,688
What?

876
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,823
Gus, your parents lied to you.

877
00:35:16,873 --> 00:35:19,128
We do it sometimes to protect our kids.

878
00:35:19,178 --> 00:35:20,834
Your bird bit the big one. Sorry, pal.

879
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:24,278
Yeah, not all pets can go live on a
special wheat farm like my rabbits.

880
00:35:25,496 --> 00:35:26,750
That's right, son.

881
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,694
Where is this bird sanctuary?

882
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,244
Third street and d.

883
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,780
- Third and d.
- Yeah.

884
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,918
Really?

885
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:35,936
Dude, hundreds of birds chirping.

886
00:35:35,986 --> 00:35:37,544
That never occurred to you till now?

887
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:40,120
Leaving Mrs. Mugglesworth
was a painful memory, Shawn.

888
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,833
I blocked it out until 12 seconds ago.

889
00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:44,030
Guys, guys, guys. The Daedalus building.

890
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,289
It's right there. Right in that area.

891
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:47,186
Well when is it schedded
to be retrofitted?

892
00:35:47,236 --> 00:35:48,518
Tomorrow.

893
00:35:48,954 --> 00:35:51,090
Well that means your pyromaniac
is gonna get to work today.

894
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,195
Shawn, we told Morgan to
check all these buildings.

895
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:55,695
I gotta call her. Tell her
not to go in without backup.

896
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,863
Dammit, I still can't
get a hold of Morgan.

897
00:36:17,913 --> 00:36:19,326
I got a bad feeling about this.

898
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:20,810
You call Lassiter and
the fire department?

899
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,670
They're on their way.

900
00:36:30,825 --> 00:36:31,867
Morgan!

901
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:40,732
Army Johnson?

902
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,331
Stay where you are.

903
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:43,775
Don't make a move.

904
00:36:44,857 --> 00:36:46,918
Dude. Start talking.

905
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,718
Stall him till everybody gets here.

906
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,135
Don't let him toss that flame.

907
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,451
I know you killed those criminals.

908
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:54,963
But I know why.

909
00:36:55,663 --> 00:36:58,279
Honey, the last time
this city had an arsonist

910
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:01,001
Was so long ago, I was
still on the big red truck.

911
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:02,385
Because

912
00:37:02,435 --> 00:37:04,907
Back in the day, you were a fireman.

913
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:09,009
And those vandals set fires that took
the lives of two of your colleagues.

914
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:11,962
Died fighting the Renkel fires of '98.

915
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:13,556
Set by a bunch of vandals.

916
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:16,508
I served side-by-side with
those firemen for years.

917
00:37:16,558 --> 00:37:17,886
They had families.

918
00:37:18,442 --> 00:37:19,641
You're right. They did.

919
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:22,953
So you left the department.

920
00:37:23,003 --> 00:37:24,680
You took a job

921
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:27,075
Inspecting buildings
for code violations.

922
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,331
And you discovered...

923
00:37:29,662 --> 00:37:31,865
those are pretty good
places to hide a body.

924
00:37:33,062 --> 00:37:35,570
So you stalked and killed your victims,

925
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,464
You covered them with lye,

926
00:37:37,514 --> 00:37:40,779
And then plugged them into walls.

927
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:50,126
But your old buddy the
fire chief figured you out.

928
00:37:50,582 --> 00:37:51,663
Made a few calls.

929
00:37:51,773 --> 00:37:54,289
Five calls in a row to hardware
stores all over the city.

930
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,435
Affirmed that it was you
that bought the accelerant...

931
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:00,147
then finally,

932
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:01,029
He caught you in the act.

933
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,375
Army, what are you doing?

934
00:38:02,425 --> 00:38:03,947
Don't do it! Don't do it!

935
00:38:04,255 --> 00:38:05,871
But it was too late, wasn't it?

936
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,725
Always the fireman,
he tried to put it out.

937
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:16,270
You even tried to save his life.

938
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:18,285
Come on, Danny.

939
00:38:18,335 --> 00:38:20,014
It wasn't my fault.

940
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,656
Danny wasn't supposed to be there.

941
00:38:22,706 --> 00:38:24,338
What about us?

942
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,155
What about your arson inspector?

943
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,400
We didn't do anything.

944
00:38:29,623 --> 00:38:31,533
Do we deserve to die?

945
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,474
I don't...

946
00:38:40,008 --> 00:38:41,835
I don't...

947
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:45,192
- no.
- No.

948
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:46,561
But--

949
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:49,448
But I can't live with this anymore.

950
00:38:49,498 --> 00:38:50,818
No.

951
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:52,754
Gus!

952
00:38:52,804 --> 00:38:54,393
Get Morgan, get Morgan!

953
00:39:09,218 --> 00:39:11,604
This is a mess. Where's Shawn?

954
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,258
His car's over there.

955
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:38,303
I can see somebody coming out.

956
00:40:20,403 --> 00:40:21,262
You guys okay?

957
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:23,202
What the hell happened?

958
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:26,707
What is Army Johnson doing here?

959
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,060
Army
tr--

960
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,921
He is the--
He is--

961
00:40:37,545 --> 00:40:39,427
He's the bad guy.

962
00:40:41,118 --> 00:40:42,457
Really?

963
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,435
Well, look at that.

964
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:51,527
Got you doing the grunt work, huh?

965
00:40:51,577 --> 00:40:53,891
Well, all the new
volunteers have to do it.

966
00:40:53,941 --> 00:40:56,270
- How's it going so far?
- I'm pretty much a hero to the newbies.

967
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,017
I mean, I've already been in two fires,

968
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:00,121
Carried a man out, stopped an arsonist.

969
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:01,619
Yes, you have.

970
00:41:01,669 --> 00:41:04,527
Well, I just wanted to drop something
by before I visit Morgan in the hospital.

971
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:06,197
- What's that?
- Meet...

972
00:41:06,247 --> 00:41:08,342
your new firedog.

973
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:10,918
Lady Godiva.

974
00:41:11,485 --> 00:41:13,264
That's a boy, Shawn.

975
00:41:14,061 --> 00:41:15,387
Oh, yeah, look at that.

976
00:41:15,437 --> 00:41:16,956
Now I've already cleared
it with the new fire chief.

977
00:41:17,006 --> 00:41:19,712
You just gotta walk him, feed him,
clean up after him and whatnot.

978
00:41:19,762 --> 00:41:21,657
He needs eye drops at
2:00, ear drops at 3:00,

979
00:41:21,707 --> 00:41:23,222
And he may or may not have mange.

980
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,598
You're not leaving that thing
here. I'm not taking care of him.

981
00:41:25,996 --> 00:41:29,530
Gus, if you don't take him,
Cruella will turn him into earmuffs.

982
00:41:33,038 --> 00:41:34,857
Good-bye, lady g.

983
00:41:36,218 --> 00:41:37,358
Shawn!

984
00:41:37,408 --> 00:41:38,652
Shawn!

985
00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:42,467
Did you paint these spots on?
