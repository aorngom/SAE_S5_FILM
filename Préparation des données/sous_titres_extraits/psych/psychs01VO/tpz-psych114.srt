1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,363
I'll raise.

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:05,870
I've got a good feeling
about this hand.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,699
Too rich for me. Fold.

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,943
Big surprise, rookie.
That's all you ever do
is fold.

5
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:18,579
Call. What do you say to that,
big shot?

6
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,688
I say...

7
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,760
The last card didn't make
Mr. O'Grady's flush.

8
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,757
Mr. Duritz was smart to fold
'cause he missed his straight.

9
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:46,705
And you, Mr. Hastings,
your cards just stink.

10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,671
You're bluffing. I call.

11
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,515
Two pair, Jacks and 7 s.
Oh! Damn it!

12
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,054
(ALL LAUGHING)
Every time.

13
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,282
FRANK: You'd think
we'd know better by now.

14
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,621
HENRY: What the hell is
goin' on here?

15
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,429
HENRY: Poker, Shawn? Poker?

16
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,325
What were you thinking?

17
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,701
I don't know.
I get bored waiting.

18
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,361
Oh, well,
why didn't you
just say so?

19
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,736
I mean, if you're bored,
I guess it's okay.

20
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,707
What is wrong with you?

21
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,073
How do you even know
how to play poker?

22
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,610
Mr. Hastings taught me.

23
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,146
Hastings, uh?

24
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,078
Well, I want it to stop.
Do you understand?

25
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,946
No more poker,
no more gambling.
You're too young.

26
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,883
Dad, I don't gamble.
I win.

27
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,978
You win? Oh, uh-huh.

28
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,920
And approximately
how often do you lose?

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,753
I don't know.
You don't know.

30
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,453
Well, I haven't lost yet.

31
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,487
How much?
How much did you win?

32
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:46,999
Is that it?

33
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,310
All right, son,
listen to me.

34
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,946
Just because
you can do something

35
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,678
doesn't always mean
that you should do it,

36
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:00,980
do you understand
what I'm saying?

37
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,112
No.

38
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,152
Hey, that's mine!

39
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,214
Not anymore.

40
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,316
Yes, it is!

41
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,657
Uh-uh, no. No, no, no, no.
I'm giving it away.

42
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,526
Giving it away.
Why? Because I can.

43
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,396
And according to
your little philosophy,
your poker philosophy,

44
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,935
if I can,
then I should, right?

45
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,043
I know it might seem like
you're gonna win every time,
Shawn,

46
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,703
but no matter
how good you are,

47
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,713
there's always somebody
who's better.

48
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,209
And there's one rule
in gambling,

49
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,011
the house always wins.
Eventually.

50
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,623
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

51
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,884
Don't gamble.

52
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,289
Not for money.

53
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,987
GUS: I got 10 bucks says
you can't make this shot. Ooh!

(GUS EXHALING)

55
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,324
Gus, I can't take your money.

56
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,624
That's right.
'Cause you can't
make the shot.

57
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,998
I could easily
make the shot,

58
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,061
which is why
I can't take your money.
There's no sport in it.

59
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,068
I say you're all mouth.

60
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,836
I'm all mouth?
Yep.

61
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,768
All right.

Sail straight,

64
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,502
Okay. Double or nothing.

65
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,162
Trivia question this time.
History.

Grover Cleveland.
Damn!

67
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,339
How do you do that?
It's the sweetness.

68
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,202
So, this is how
you spend your days.

69
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,769
Oh, my God!
Dad, what are
you doing here?

70
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,907
Nice. Is that the way
you greet all the people
that come through your door?

71
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,508
That's exactly
how I greet everyone.

72
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,451
Maybe that's why
business is down.
Hmm.

73
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,783
Are you gonna invite me in?

74
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,254
Oh, yeah, please...
No!

75
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,586
This could be a trick.

76
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,126
What's the rule with vampires,
don't they have to be
invited in?

77
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,320
What are you talking about,
Shawn?

78
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,330
Gus, you've seen
<i>Lost Boys</i> 1 <i>4</i> times.
What's the rule?

79
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,932
You're on your own.

80
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,530
Is this all there is?

81
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,707
Actually, this is
the, uh, satellite office.

in an underground ice cave

83

Gus and I sculpted
last winter.

84
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,277
What about your license?

85
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,283
Ahem, my pilot's license?
It's out back in the Cessna.

86
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,320
Or perhaps you're referring
to my license to kill.

87
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,412
Revoked. Problems
at the Kazakhstan border.

88
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,423
I could give you
the details, but then
I'd have to kill you,

89
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,324
which I can't do because
my license to kill
has been revoked.

90
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,056
I'm talkin' about
your private eye license.

91
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,256
Well, you need one, don't ya?

Oh, well,
hurray for loopholes!

00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,668
A little dark.

95
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,007
Probably could use
a couple more lamps, you know,
probably killing your eyes.

96
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:42,479
That outlet... Ah, yeah,
looks a little overloaded.

97
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,608
Yeah, I think that plasma,
you'd probably do better
by puttin' it on that wall,

98
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:48,347
you'd have less glare
comin' in through the window
in the afternoon.

but we're kind of
in the middle
of something here.

102
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,689
What would that be, Shawn?
Would that be NBA

Believe it or not,
we have an 11:00.

105
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,298
So maybe
we should wrap this up.

106
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,963
Yeah, it's a little too late
for that, Shawn.

107
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,107

HENRY: Bill Peterson.
He owns Peterson Motors.

113
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,735
Met him about 20 years ago
when I grabbed
a couple of punks

114
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,368
boosting tires
off of his lot.

115
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,174
Shawn, shouldn't you be
writing some of this down?

116
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,180
Why would I do that?
Will there be a quiz?

117
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,148
Just shut up
and pay attention.

118
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,811
I got a call
from him yesterday.
He's got a kid, Brandon.

119
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,877
He's just a little younger
than you.

120
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,786
He thinks his son might be
mixed up in something.

121
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,620
Like what?
Well, he'll fill you in
when he gets here.

122
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,183
The point is, he doesn't want
the cops involved.
So, he called me.

123
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,821
And you said...
I said I'm retired

124
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,524
and he should definitely
involve the cops.

125
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,432
Sweet. You came all the way
down here to tell us that.
Awesome.

126
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,868
No, Shawn. He doesn't want
his son in trouble,

127
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:15,772
and I might have mentioned
to Peterson accidentally
that, you, uh...

128
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,303
You might be able to help.

129
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,575
Whoa, time out!
Flag on the play!
Did you vouch for me?

130
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,740
No, I wouldn't say
I exactly vouched for you.

131
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,841
Gus, Henry vouched for me.
I did not vouch for you!

132
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,614
You were bragging on me.
You have a dad-crush on me.

133
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,121
Shawn, I was not
bragging on you.

134
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:34,455
I merely restated stats
about your track record
that are in the newspaper.

135
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,118
Let's hug it out.
Put your arms down.

136
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,685
Gimme a hug.
Put your...
No, I'm not gonna give you...

137
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,255
If I'd known that
Peterson was gonna
insist on hiring you,

138
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,857
I would've blasted
your character outright

139
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,960
and I would've mentioned
your unnatural fear
of pointy things.

140
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,005
Ah!
Distaste for pointy things.

141

Please,
just do me this one favor.

142
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,502
Would you listen
to the man's story,
tell him you can't help?

143
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,442
Send him to the cops,
and whatever you do,

he worked for me.
Now he's disappeared.

a few weeks ago?
I fired him.

to buckle down,
focus in on something.

168
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,595
How did that go?

169
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,832
Well, he's been evicted
from his apartment,
his cell phone's been cut off

170
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:56,841
and he forged a check
from my account
to the tune of $30,000.

171
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,275
I need to find my son.
Can you help me?

172
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,439
Well, Mr. Peterson,
this sounds like a case
for the police.

173
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,573
Let me get you a number.

174
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,640
Gus, don't be a gooey
chocolate chip cookie.
What?

175
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,345
This is precisely
what we do here, sir.

176
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,116
We find people.
We'll find your Brandon.

177
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,289
Okay, make sure
we are not disturbed.

178
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,527
I need five minutes
uninterrupted.
Make sure no one comes in.

179
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,659
Yeah.

180
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,739
VICK: What's with
all the secrecy, O'Hara?

181
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,438
I've got a real mindbender.

182
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,344
Problem with
the railway theft?

183
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,746
No. It's a detective.

184
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,842
Is this something
for Internal Affairs?

185
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,580
It's Detective Lassiter.

186
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,144
What's the problem
with our Head Detective?

187
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,382
Well, it's his birthday.

188
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,357
Oh, that's not a problem.

189
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,825
Yeah! It is!
He seems quiet.

190
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,692
He is quiet.
That's who he is.

191
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,822
Look, O'Hara, I think
it's nice that you care
for your partner,

192
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,992
but he is a grown man.
He'll be fine.

193
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,831
I just thought
it would be nice
to surprise him.

194
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:58,996
Oh...

195
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,633
Detective Lassiter
does not like surprises.

196
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,641
Of course he likes surprises.
Everybody likes surprises.

197
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,201
Detective Lassiter
has a very particular
comfort zone.

198
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,148
And you don't even wanna
know what we now call the
Secret Santa Debacle of 2005.

199
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,583
I just wanted to do
something nice for him,

200
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:14,779
but nobody seems to know
what he likes!

201
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,220
Well, you're his partner,
shouldn't you know?

202
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,758
Well, we don't really talk.

203
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,717
I mean, he doesn't.

204
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:27,459
He nods and responds mostly.
He never really
poses a question.

205
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:31,560
Although sometimes he asks
if we can ride in silence.

206
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,333
O'Hara, your heart
is in the right place,

207
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,440
but I am very sure
that you're gonna have to
do this yourself.

208
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,977
Okay, fine.

209
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,641
Shawn, what are we doin' here?

210
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,744
Brandon's dad said
he was evicted.

211
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,686
Gus, let me
ask you something.

212
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,917
When's the last time
you were evicted
from your apartment?

213
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,152
Never!

214
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,561
Exactly.
You wouldn't understand.

215
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,064
This is my world.

216
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,328
So the landlord keeps
Brandon's stuff as collateral.

217
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,134
Brandon comes back,
the landlord gets paid,

218
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,072
Brandon doesn't,
there's a garage sale.

219
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,042
Well, the buzzer upstairs
says that his is 227.

220
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,341
<i>227?</i> Marla Gibbs.
Regina King.

221
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,880
Jackée!
Hal Williams.

222
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,143
Hal Williams?
Hal Williams
as Lester Jenkins.

223
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,548
Yeah, right.

224
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,953
Looks like somebody
took a screwdriver
to this thing.

225
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,253
Lemme see.

226
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,354
Okay, so Brandon needed
something inside here,
but he couldn't get in.

227
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,330
If you were in his shoes,
what would you do next?

228
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,299
First of all,
I'd feel very
ashamed of myself.

229
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,960
Tell me about it.

230
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,710
But then,

231
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,907
I think I'd come back
with some scissors.

232
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,245
(SHAWN GRUNTING)

233
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,919
Let's see if we can find
what he's reaching for.

234
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,818
Yeah, lemme reach.
My reach is better.

235
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,083
Excuse me?
What?

236
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,852
When exactly did we have
a reaching contest?

237
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:00,983
My reach has always
been better.

238
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,154
But my arms are slender-erer.
Slender-erer?

239
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,994
What?
Slendererer...

240
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,465
Skinnier?
Yes.

241
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:12,061
You know what? You're right.
My biceps probably wouldn't
fit through this thing anyway.

242
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,197
I knew you'd fall for that!

243

(GRUNTING)

244
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,673
Let me see.

245
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:28,618
Hmm. Final notice,
final notice, final notice,
plus an eviction?

246
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,316
Gosh, this kid has
some serious
cash flow problems.

247
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,517
No wonder why
he stole from his pops.

248
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,187
What do you got?
A bunch of pawnshops.

249
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,294
Whoa! Wait a second.

250
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,327
If you're a guy
with an apartment,

251
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,458
what's the one thing
you definitely don't have?

252
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,866
I don't know. A horse?

253
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,460
A horse, that's true!

(IMITATING BUZZER)

255
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,164
Answer we were looking for
was yard or garden.

256
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,732
I would have accepted
both yard and garden.

257
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,835
I was joking, Shawn.

258
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,107
So if you're a guy
without a yard or a garden...
Shawn!

259
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,082
...why would you have
a business card
for a garden supply store?

00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,153
Of course. Rrlrll.

00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,160
No, no. Rrlrll! Rrlrll.

264
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,217
What does it mean?

265
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,196
We should probably
figure that out, huh?
You think?

266
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,263
GUS: How long are we
gonna sit here?

267
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,892
Brandon might not even
show up.

268
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,869
When I suggested
we do a stakeout,
you were, like,

269
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,236
"No, no, we need to do
something active."

270
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,172
I am doing
something active.
What?

271
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,477
I'm preparing to try
and enjoy this chalupa.

272
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,070
Odd.

273
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,410
No, what's odd,
the customers that keep
driving into this place.

274
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,957
Look at these cars.
They're ridiculous!

275
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,692
They're all fancy
and what not.

276
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,992
Not exactly what you'd use
to pick up shrubs
and fertilizer.

277
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,795
Let's see what
these people are up to.

278
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,442

Maybe we should
take a peek and see what
we're getting into, Shawn.

Ooh, you know
what this is, Shawn?

298
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,353
It's one of those
underground poker games.

299
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,944
My poker buddies
talk about them.

300
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,421
SHAWN: Since when do you have
poker buddies?

301
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,390
My online poker buddies,
Shawn.

302
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,859
I'm good.
I'm up $7 million dollars.

303
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,788
You have $7 million dollars
and you failed to mention it
to me till just now?

304
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,699
It's not real money, Shawn.
That's illegal.

305
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,438
Rough luck there again, huh?

306
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,598
Yeah, a bit of bad luck.

307
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,699
Dude, you should get
in this game.
How?

308
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,971
These games are tight.
You gotta know somebody
to get in.

00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,411
Well, let's just throw
Brandon's name around,
maybe they'll let us in.

310
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,540
Uh, yeah, one more hand,
I'll get it.

311
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,948
It's just not working out
for you today, is it?
No. Not right now.

312
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,748
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you stand up here?

313
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,617
I'm just gonna...
Come on. Come here.

314
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,181
It's okay. It's okay.

315
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,782
Okay.
Just relax now.

316
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,293
Put your hand up
like this.
Why?

317
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,885
Just hold it up.
There you go.

318
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,989
Now, maybe next time,
you won't force me

319
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,897
into such a barbaric form
of retribution.

320
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,869
Good news, there appears
to be a seat opening up.

321
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,031
Still, I think our best
course of action would be...

322
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,403
Get the hell outta here!
Go!

323
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,339
Go! Go, go!

324
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,109
I want you to know
I cannot hear
anything you say!

325
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,206
Shawn,
what the hell is going on?

326
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,944
What the...
Shawn, what are you doing?

327
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,815
It's his ongoing
sensory-deprivation
experiment,

328
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,514
sharpening one sense
by denying others.

329
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,148
In this case, he can't hear,
which only amplifies
his sense of smell.

330
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,248
What?
Amazing!

331
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,816
That's one word for it.

332
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,020
I need complete
and utter silence.

333
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,586
What do you need
silence for, Shawn,
if you can't hear anything?

334
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,154
Shh!
Please! Henry,

Let's call
the whole thing off!

Mr. Peterson,
I want you to grab my arm.

339
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,911
Both hands,
like you're doing a pull-up.

340

341
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,911
I will now become a conduit
to your son's thoughts.

342
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,713
Please, clear your mind
and your nasal passages.

343
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,919

and those chips.

345
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,956
I'm getting something.

347
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,791
That's a shocker.

Oh, ah, I'm wrong!
It's not potato!

349
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,631

What?

359
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,657

and the playing cards?

around him.

Well,
diamonds represent wealth.

370
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,514
So Brandon lost his wealth
playing poker?

371
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:41,616
That's correct, Gus.

372
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,526
Yeah, well,
what do all these clubs
around him mean, Shawn?

373

Has he mentioned
any of the guys
he plays poker with?

380
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,840
That was his online
screen name.

381
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,645

on his computer

to be working.

00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,180
And I'm Felicia.

509
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,447
Great! Yeah, I knew it.

510
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,457
All hot internet women
are guys!

511
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,888
Of course, you're two guys,
which makes it doubly weird.

512
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,759
Sorry, Brandon,
but your Dad's
lookin' for you.

513
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,025
SHAWN: That's the rub.
He hired us.

514
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,825
Oh, yeah?
Well, the joke's on you
'cause I'm outta here.

515
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,335
Hey, we just wanna talk.

516
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,437
What's goin' on?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

517
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,807
You, uh,
you know these guys?

518
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,642
Hey, relax.
Brandon and I are friends.

519
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,545
I just wanna talk to him
for a minute.

520
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,675
So how's it goin',
you good?
BRANDON: Yeah.

521
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:40,842
(GROANS)

522
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,113
Hey!
Whoa!

523
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:46,055
(COUGHING)
It's just so you don't forget.
You have until Monday.

524
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,222
Oh!

525
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,891
You were saying?

526
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,563
Well, it looks like
your dad's not the only one
who's lookin' for ya, huh?

527
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,642
All right, look.
You guys gotta give me
a break, okay?

528
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,736
I stole $30,000 dollars
from my dad

529
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:12,580
and then I lost it,
and more, to that jerk,
J.P. Berger.

530
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:16,012
So I can't go home,
not until I win enough
to pay everybody back.

531
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,918
What'd he say,
you've got till Monday?

532
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,457
Yeah, he did,
but see, the thing is,

533
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,619
I'm a better player
than he is. I am much better.

534
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,663
And yet he bent you
over his knee

535
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,857
and spanked you
in front of
the whole class.

536
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,594
But he shouldn't have!

537
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,967
I just... I just gotta
figure out how he did it.

538
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,905
Look, Brandon, it's simple.

539
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,339
You go to your dad
and convince him
to give you your job back.

540
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,934
And then you figure out a way
to pay this Berger back
his money.

541
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,876
Yeah,
that sounds really great.

542
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,074
But, guys,
I can't go back to work
for my dad.

543
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,175
Nothing I do is ever
good enough for that man,
nothing is right.

544
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,981
You have no idea
what that's like.

545
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:52,420
Look,
here's some brutal truth.

546
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,085
We're the only reasons
you're not in jail, or worse.

547
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,252
Your dad's done.

548
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:00,128
It took someone cashing in
a very old favor
to get us involved at all.

549
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:03,929
Now, you are not gonna
be able to play your way
out of this hole, baby boy!

550
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,665
So pack it in!
Pull the plug! Shut it down!

551
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,207
Leave the dead meat
in the freezer
and put on your Sunday best,

552
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,004
'cause it's Arbor Day, baby!

553
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,472
Okay. Fair enough.

554
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,614
Let's get this over with.

555
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,447
Take me to my father.

556
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,554
BRANDON: What'd I tell ya?

557
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:29,185
Morning till night,
the old man
never stops selling.

558
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,186
Want some advice?

559
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,287
Yeah, sure.

560
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,093
When you owe a man
$30,000 dollars,

561
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,725
I'd be careful about
criticizing his work ethic.

562
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,291
That's a good point.

563
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:39,661
You want us
to come with you?

564
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,638
No. No, you know what?

565
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:45,167
I screwed up on my own,
I am gonna face him
on my own.

566
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,276
That's very
Cameron Frye of you.

567
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,903
It's Cameron who?

568
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,779
Wow, are we that much
older than you?

569
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,744
What's that?

570
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,809
That's nothin'.
It's a good luck charm.

571
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,447
I mean, used to be.
But you know what?

572
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,924
Here. I don't need it.

573
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,550
I've given up cards,
I got no use for it.

574
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,255
Whoa! No, thanks.
Not really a jewelry guy.

575
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,627
Gus here is.
No, I'm not.

576
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:07,756
Sure you are.

577
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,094
Right.

578
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,162
Phew!
Let's get this over with,
right?

579
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,099
You tryin'
to pass that thing
off to me?

580
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,004
You liked it.
You like the sweet turquoise.

581
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,519
So you're telling me that
you've been working with him
for 15 years,

582
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,352
but you have no idea
what kind of food he likes?

583
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,449
He orders separate
when we get take-out.

584
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,323
Something about poison.

585
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,008
What are you doing?

586
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,508
Looking.

587
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:31,707
For what?

588
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,207
A mint.

589
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,343
I'm allergic to mint.
Ah-ha!

590
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,444
What?

591
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,749
Nothing.

592
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,355
I'm just happy.

593
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,552
Now I know
you don't like mint.

594
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,394
HENRY: Well, well.

595
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,027
Don't you look like hell.

596
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,503
I know I look
like hell, Dad.

597
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,733
Everyone who gets up
at this hour
looks like hell.

598
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,867
With the possible exception
of Matt Lauer and Diane Lane.

599
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,138
Mr. Peterson,
how are you, sir?
Something wrong?

600
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,236
No, no, Shawn,
everything is great.

601
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:06,113
That's why I woke your ass up,
had you zip down here
so Bill and I could tell you

602
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,879
how terrific everything is.

603
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,715
It's Brandon.
Brandon?

604
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:13,147
Well, he seemed fine when
we dropped him off yesterday,
maybe a little nervous.

605
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,158
Wait, wait, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
You found him?

606
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,318
Well, yeah, we did.

607
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,419
When was this?
Yesterday.

608
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,432
I'm sorry, sir,
I should have told you.

609
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,958
It was right before closing.
We could clearly see you
from Gus' car,

610
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,403
and he said he wanted
to come in by himself,

611
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,169
do this man-to-man,
you know, just you and him.

612
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,903
He didn't come in?
You never saw him?

613
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,570
Oh, we saw him, all right.

614
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,241
I got the reunion right here.
You wanna see it?

615
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,245
PETERSON: There he is,
there's my boy.

616
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,050
Guess he couldn't face me,
so he waited until
after I went home.

617
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,557
Not the safe?
He's breaking into
your safe?

618
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,991
Breaking in? No,
he didn't have to break in.

619
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,585
He's too smart for that.

620
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,153
He knows the combination!

621
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,831
There you have it.
Not quite the reunion
I imagined.

622
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,275
So tell me, psychic,

623
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,508
where's my son now?

624
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,282
SHAWN: Something's
bothering me, dude.

625
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,586
I'm never wrong!

626
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,183
You're always wrong,
what are you talkin' about?

627
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,888
That this kid should be
a better poker player, Gus.

628
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,624
That was a pretty good bluff.

629
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,165
Oh, dude, look!

630
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,832
What?
Right there.
That necklace thing.

631
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:33,996
That's horrible.

632
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:37,098
He wears his ridiculous
good luck charm into battle

633
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,733
the way that Superman
wears his cape,

634
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,744
or Rocky Balboa
wears his belt.

635
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:44,578
I bet you he's on his way
back to the maze
to take on Berger.

636
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,277
No, Berger's not gonna be
at the lawn and garden center.
Not this weekend.

637
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,341
Why not?

638
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,684
There's a tournament goin' on
where the winner gets a buy-in
to the World Poker Derby.

639
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:52,745
You know where that is?

640
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,086
Of course I do!
Phew!

641
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:58,788
Ooh! Phew! Ah!
Oh, it's flipping!

642
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,388
Ah, it wants to flip!
Oh, it wants to flop!
Dad!

643
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,191
(GRUNTING)

644
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,104
T.P.

645
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,672
Toilet paper... No.

646
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,281
Teri Polo.
Shawn...

647
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,145
T.P. Tee-pee.

648
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,118
Tee-pee with a chimmy...

649
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:26,279
Chimmy, chimmy-changa,
chimi-changa, Chaka Khan.
Chaka Khan. Chaka Khan.

650
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:27,915
Chimi-changa.
Cha-changa?

651
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,051
Cha-changa!
That's it.

652
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,289
You say tomato,
I say to-mah-to.

653
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,592
Cha-changa.

654
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,332
The Indian casino?

655
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,868
Cha-ching!

656
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,131
Damn it!
You were right, Henry.

657
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,494
How's that?

658
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:45,532
Maybe getting the police
involved is the only way
to get his attention.

659
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,906
May I have that DVD, please?

660
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,476
(SHAWN EXCLAIMS)

661
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,239
No.

662
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,046
Excuse me?
Shawn!

663
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,177
Not yet.

664
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,376
Why?

665
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,816
Let's give him another chance.

666
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,159
I'm sensing there's
more to this story, sir.

667
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,423
He's actually
a pretty good poker player.

668
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,127
I'm getting a very,
very strong
psychic vibration

669
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,669
he's gonna lose

670
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,738
big!

671
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,476
Not with my money
he's not.

672
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,177
Let's go.
Oh, God.

673
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,653
We're outta here.
No, Dad. Dad, I can't.

674
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,780
Would you rather
I call the police

675
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,847
and show them a certain video
of you looting my safe?

676
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,620
I know,
I'm sorry about all that.

677
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:36,887
No, Brandon. Let's go.

678
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,657
No, Dad, Dad,
I'm in more trouble here
than you think.

679
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,996
I'm already in!
And they don't give refunds
here.

680
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,266
Fine.

681
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,338
I'll play.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You?

682
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,967
You know what?
Actually, sir,
this is your call.

683
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,274
I work for you.
But keep in mind
that I am a psychic

684
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,211
and, unlike any of these
other players,

685
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,648
I come with
a money-back guarantee.

686
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,214
What do you think, Henry?
Can he win?

687
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,646
<i>Dad, I don't gamble. I win.</i>

688
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,253
Yeah. He can win.

689
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,465
So, what's the deal?

690
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,025
GUS: Shawn and Berger
drew opposite tables.

691
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,594
The only way for him
face Berger is if he beats
everyone at his table,

692
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,607
makes it to the finals,
and wins.

693
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:30,807
Check.

694
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:46,962
God, must be rough.

695
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:49,991
Sorry?

696
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,161
You picked the wrong week
to quit smoking, dude.

697
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,931
There's a tournament
happening here.

698
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,871
What are you talking about?

699
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,931
What is this about?
Is this about
your lady friend, huh?

700
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,773
Your special girl back home?
She doesn't like it?

701
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:04,109
Look at the cards, guys, huh?
Lot of possibilities
on the table right now.

702
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,945
Lot of possibilities.

703
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:09,212
Fifty thousand.

704
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,950
(WHISTLES)
Midnight oil says no! No!

705
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,249
Call.

706
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,725
Ay-ay-ay, action.

707
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:20,560
Action in my fanny pack.
All right, I'll call you both.

your straight, did you?

You let me down.

Ronnie!

713
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,138
What?

714
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,183
This can be your time,
right here, right now.

715
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,512
You think you can mess
with my head, too?

716
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:41,779
Here's the thing,
I'm a psychic.

717
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,287
So if I had to guess,
which I don't, I'd say yes.

718
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:48,052
Yes, I can mess with your head
and I can put an entire
sandwich in your hair.

719
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,117
Well, you know what?
I'm not playing
with a psychic.

720
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,525
It's against the rules.

721
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:54,360
Against the rules?
No, guys, guys,
I checked the rulebook.

722
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,990
I looked in the index
under "P".

723
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,093
It mentioned polygamy,
pancakes, and pterodactyls.

724
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,104
Who knew pterodactyl started
with a "P"?

725
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,935
I bet you did. You did.

726
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,168
It's not against the rules,
Ronnie. It's cool.

727
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,006
No, it's not cool.

728
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,477
Look at your stack, man.

729
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,241
Everything's here.
Everything's here.

730
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:13,044
I need you here.
Take a risk, man!
Bluff it up!

731
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,977
I'll raise you
two hundred thousand.

732
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,915
You just bluffed
to prove to me
that you could bluff.

733

00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,919

the all in.

Wait, wait, wait.

we stop the game.

Shh! I can't hear them
if you're talking, Berger.

And how do they know that?

756
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,715
We're really supposed to
believe that you're psychic
or something!

757
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:39,490
If you were psychic,
I wouldn't be cleaning
your clock right now.

758
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,863
Cleaning my clock?
What does that mean, Berger?

759
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,562
What, you'd take time out
of your day to clean
another man's timepiece?

760
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,433
And if so,
that would be a bad thing?

761
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,939
No, I would be gracious.
I would say, "J.P., dude,

"thanks for
spritzing my watch."

Besides, it doesn't matter.

764
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:57,214
Doesn't take a psychic
to figure out that
these cards are marked.

You know what,
if you had been
paying attention,

some kind of invisible ink
on this hair clip,

and every time she fussed
with her ponytail,

785
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,801
and I think we can all agree
it's a fetching tail,
it's a silky tail,

786
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:58,831
she got the ink on her fingers
and then she put her fingers
on the cards!

And then her special partner
with his special

00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,241
ALL: Surprise!

844
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,774
JULIET: Whoa! Whoa!
No, it's okay.

845
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:54,977
MAN: Whoa! Move it!

846
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:57,350
JULIET: Oh! Oh, my gosh,
no, no, no!
No, no, no, Carlton!

847
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,446
Hey! It's a party,
it's a party!

848
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,547
It's what?

849
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,593
For your birthday! Surprise!

850
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,957
Why are these people
at my house?

851
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,358
They're your friends.

852
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:09,490
No, they're not.

853
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:12,263
Yeah, they are!
I got 'em out
of your address book.

854
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:13,831
You took my book?

855
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,634
Yes, I admit it,
I opened your desk.

856
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,868
I didn't want to load you up
with a bunch of work people,

857
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,774
so I just invited the ones
with stars by their names.

858
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,745
These are all people
I put in jail.

859
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,576
The stars are
repeat offenders.

860
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,913
You keep a little black book
of people you've arrested?

861
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,247
Of course I do.

862
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,310
Why?

863
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,084
To drive by and check on them.

864
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,966
Um, um, oh, Carlton,
where are you going?

865
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,524
To pack!
Why?

866
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,069
Because now they know
where I live!

867
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:50,999
Happy Birthday, dude!

868
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,406
Happy Birthday!

869
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,036
MAN: Nice house!

870
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,742
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

871
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,689
<i>In between the lines</i>
<i>there's a lot of obscurity</i>

872
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,200
<i>I'm not inclined</i>
<i>to resign to maturity</i>

873
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:23,601
<i>If it's all right</i>
<i>then you're all wrong</i>

874
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:27,132
<i>But why bounce around</i>
<i>to the same damn song?</i>

875
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:32,642
<i>You'd rather run</i>
<i>when you can't crawl</i>

876
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:38,053
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>That I'm not telling the truth</i>

877
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:41,285
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>They just don't have any proof</i>

878
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:44,350
<i>Embrace the deception</i>
<i>Learn how to bend</i>

879
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:48,555
<i>Your worst inhibitions</i>
<i>tend to psych you out</i>
<i>in the end</i>

880
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,327
<i>I know, you know</i>

881
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:53,831
<i>I know, you know</i>
