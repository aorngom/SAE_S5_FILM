1
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,705
How long
do we have to wait?

2
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,938
Until we catch
our bad guy.

3
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,037
Can I sleep?

4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,082
You can't sleep
on a stakeout, Shawn.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,912
You can eat. You can chew gum.

6
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:20,782
But you can't drink
because if you drink,
you're gonna have to pee.

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,017
And the target
always comes out
right when you got to pee.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,455
Now I think I gotta pee.

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,722
Well, then, Shawn,
your bladder is going to get
some training tonight, too.

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,460
(LAUGHING)

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,626
We've got action.
Now, I want you to stay down.

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,930
I know, I know, I know.

13
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,436
(SHUSHING) Go! Go!

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,342
Come on.

15
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:57,288
I got you.
I got you red-handed,
you lying son of a bitch.

16
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:01,060
"I don't know what happening
to your newspaper, Henry."
You're transparent, Clark.

17
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,992
You didn't think
I could nab a liar like you?

18
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,223
CLARK: I can explain!

19
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,663
Tell it to
the Neighborhood
Watch Association.

20
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,825
Give the paper
to the boy, Clark.

21
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,401
What the hell are you doing?

22
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,740
Checking baseball scores.
My fantasy team is killing me.

23
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:19,904
This is the Chief's office!

24
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,503
I know, she runs the league.

25
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,609
I'm kidding.

26
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,344
She's in a meeting.
She won't mind.

27
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,182
Plus, we look really important
hanging out in here.

28
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,722
Gus, have you
tried this chair?

29
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,086
It's a pregnancy chair.

30
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,821
We have gotta get one
for the office immediately.

31
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,692
My birthing canal
has never felt so in line.

32
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,561
We need to
get out of here.
She told me to wait.

33
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,031
For what?
Gus, I'm not a mind reader.

34
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,535
No, that's just
what you tell everybody.

35
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,833
I want you to try this chair.

36
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,105
I'm not
trying that chair, Shawn.

37
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,369
I'll sit on
the birthing ball.

38
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,469
I kid you not,
that thing is like
a refreshing waterfall

39
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,776
cascading down your vertebrae.

40
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,879
It might help
with your stomach issues.

41
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,316
Who told you
I had stomach issues?

42
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,647
My nose?

43
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,780
The vent in the bathroom?
Air fresheners
all over the place?

44
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,291
I'm trying a new medication
for my lactose intolerance.

45
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,054
I believe
the problem is physical.

46
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,325
And I think it
can be cured by what
I'm now referring to as

47
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,422
the magic springy
bounce-up chair.

48
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,195
Hey, Shawn,
smoothies are here.

49
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,462
Pineapple?
Of course.

50
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,628
Thanks, Buzz.

51
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:18,728
(SLURPING)

52
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,136
You're having food delivered?

53
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,730
They were already
going out.

54
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,709
Oh, boy. I'm telling you...

55
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,074
Wow.

56
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,448
What did I tell you?

57
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,888
Now, take a hit off this
bad boy and complete
the moment, you've earned it.

58
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,057
What do you think
this is, Mr. Guster?

59
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,094
I apologize.
This will never happen again.
Give me that.

60
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,186
Boys, out!

61
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,595
What is this, Gus,
a smoothie? You know
these things stain.

62
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,660
Mmm. But they
are very delicious.

63
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,430
Chief, would you like some?
That's not my smoothie.

64
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,528
I don't care
whose smoothie it is.

65
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,800
I don't even remember
why I asked you to stay now.

66
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,899
You want us on that case
with the blonde woman.
No.

67
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,773
Mmm-hmm, Wintersby,

68
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,244
Wilacheck, Wislerbottom?

69
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,940
No, no, it's...
Wilcroft?

70
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,949
No, that's not...
Okay, wait a minute,

71
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,451
were you listening in
on my conversation?

72
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,214
I don't know
if I heard it psychically

73
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,984
or if I saw you
walk by with her
and Detective Lassiter,

74
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,820
but I definitely heard
the word "psychic."

75
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:17,192
The woman, Raylene, said she
visits an occasional psychic.

76
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,628
She wasn't asking for one.

77
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,189
Well, not in so many words.
No, not in any words.

78
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:25,465
This is a bank robbery case.
We don't need psychics
for a bank robbery case.

79
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,630
Bank robbery?
Mmm-hmm.

80
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,333
I didn't read anything
in the paper about
a bank robbery.

81
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,534
It was four years ago.

82
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,406
So, it went unsolved?

83
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,640
It was solved.

84
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,476
Well, then what does she need
a psychic for?

85
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,607
Gus, that is a perfectly
reasonable question.

86
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,015
Thank you, Chief.
We'll be leaving now.

87
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,610
(STAMMERING)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm still confused.

88
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,385
Her husband's partners are
getting out of jail.

89
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,919
This is a routine warning
that we issue when someone
may potentially be in danger.

90
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,658
This is the part
where we offer up
our services.

91
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,063
No, I think
this is the part
where we leave.

92
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,361
That's a good idea.

93
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,198
SHAWN: But...
Believe it or not,
Mr. Spencer,

94
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,261
crimes were solved
long before you got here.

95
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,137
And they continue to be solved
when you're not around.

96
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,506
Oh, I remember
what I wanted to tell you.
What?

97
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,874
Stay out of my chair.

98
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,308
Bank robbers?
Dude, that's awesome.

99
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,079
We should go find Lassiter
and our future client.
We gotta go.

100
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:16,053
Dude, this woman is
on an eternal quest for
a good psychic? That's me!

101
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,022
I'm gonna go find them.
I'm staying right here.

102
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,151
Great idea. Wait ten seconds,
and make an entrance.
Drink some.

103
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,133
Are you saying
that I'm in danger?

104
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,501
Your husband's partners
are being paroled today.

105
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,301
I have reason to believe
their first order of business

106
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,535
is gonna be to try
and find that lost money.

107
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,271
But the only person who knew
where that money ended up
was my husband.

108
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,279
I know that.
But do they?

109
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,905
Hey, Lassi.

110
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,074
Juliet.

111
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,784
Oh, I don't believe we've met.
Or did we meet?

112
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,819
In a bank?

113
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,222
No, that's not it.
Why am I getting "bank"?

114
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,656
Piggy bank?

115
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,025
Sperm bank?

116
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,895
Doesn't matter.
I'm Shawn Spencer.

117
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,161
I am the official
head psychic
here at the department.

118
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,634
CARLTON: You don't
have a title.

119
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,194
And there is serious
doubt as to whether
you're really even psychic.

120
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,762
I solved the McCallum
disappearance.

121
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,671
And the Summerland murder.

122
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,801
Oh, and I found your keys.

123
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,436
And your badge.

124
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,541
Out.

125
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,981
Shawn, where are my keys?

126
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,279
CARLTON: No. Out!

127
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,953
If you don't mind,
we're a little busy.
We have a...

128
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,916
Excuse us, Raylene.

129
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,756
Do we know each other?

130
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,295
No, we don't. I'm sorry.

131
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:33,059
Psychic, remember?
Sometimes I can't
turn it off.

132
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,992
Do you do readings?

133
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,627
Yes, we do it all.

134
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,763
Full service.

135
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,240
I'm a bit of an enthusiast.
I used to have
a regular girl read for me.

136
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,841
Really?

137
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,641
Here's a card.

138
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,806
We're at the
beachfront location.

139
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,372
I could put my cell number
on the back if you
have any questions.

140
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,679
Any time, really.

141
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,777
Thank you,
you're so kind.

142
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,721
This is a
pharmaceutical company.

143
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,019
Like I said,
we do it all.

144
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,026
Well, I always say,
"A man with many hats..."

145
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,721
"Doesn't like his haircut"?

146
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,320
Exactly. I thought
I was the only one
who read that book.

147
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,729
It's my favorite.
Mine, too.

148
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,130
(CLEARS THROAT)
Really?

149
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,234
And scene!

<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>That I'm not telling the truth</i>

151
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,711
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>They just don't have any proof</i>

<i>Embrace the deception</i>
<i>Learn how to bend</i>

(PRINTER PRINTING)

155
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,745
Dude, what took you so long?

156
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,480
This is good stuff.
You gotta see
what happened to this car.

157
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,181
I mean, it was really...

158
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,315
What?

159
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,317
What happened here?

160
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,417
Oh, that?

161
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,928
Oh, I had a drywaller
come in and take out a wall.

162
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,225
A wall?

163
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,428
This is a rental!
What do you think
our landlord is gonna say?

164
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,469
Gee, I don't know,
"Thank you"?

165
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,936
Gus, this place
was way too cramped.

166
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,267
My name is on that lease.

167
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,136
Don't worry, I'll make sure
you get a thank you note, too.

168
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,439
You're taking my name
off the lease. And the door,
and these Frisbees.

169
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,876
Gus, don't be ridiculous.

170
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,141
Look, I'm almost positive
this isn't
a load-bearing wall.

171
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,877
But if you're really
concerned, why don't you go
jump up and down in the attic

172
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,043
and make sure?

173
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,882
What is she doing here?

174
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,082
Ah, she's our
first real client.

175
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,990
Actually client?
Hired for the job?

176
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,125
Actual client.

177
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:45,990
SHAWN: Go on, man.

178
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,932
I have to admit,
when I met you at the police
station, I was intrigued,

179
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,832
so I checked
your recent track record.

180
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,302
It's amazing, really.

181
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,402
Well, it's a team effort.

182
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,874
Not really.
I do most of the work.

183
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,742
What can we
help you with, ma'am?

184
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,441
I need you to get
in contact with someone.

185
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,746
Well, tracking people down
is our specialty.

186
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,421
What? Oh, it's not, now?

187
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,616
This one might
be a little tricky.

188
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,058
How tricky?
Is the person out
of the state? Country?

189
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,185
He's dead.

190
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,254
Ah, and I assume that's
why you need a psychic.

191
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,323
Hold on. Dead?

192
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,658
Like dead, dead?

193
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,795
Currently being
eaten by worms?

194
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,568
He's actually entombed
in a mausoleum.

195
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,733
Gus, he's ascended
to the next dimension.
It's fine.

196
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,609
No, Shawn, I think we might be
at a bit of an impasse.

197
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,147
What exactly do you
need to know?

198
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,547
My husband was not
a perfect man.

199
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,619
He got himself
in a bit of trouble.

200
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,155
Okay, I'll be honest,
it was a lot of trouble.

201
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,186
He got involved
in a bank robbery.

202
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,955
He was one of three,
but the only one
who didn't go to prison.

203
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,757
Unfortunately, the reason
he didn't get caught

204
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,593
was that he drove his car
down an embankment...

205
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:53,893
Wait.

206
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,628
I see rain.

207
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,265
No roads, no.

208
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,899
There was a fiery crash,
wasn't there?

209
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,340
Yes.

210
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,336
What would you
like me to ask, Raylene?

211
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,678
Well, this is hard to say.

212
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,048
But he was the one
designated to bury the money.

213
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,916
They were to all meet later
and divide the cash.

214
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,750
Only his partners
were caught first.

215
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,551
So why wait until now?

216
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,388
His partners think that
I know where he hid the money.

217
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,021
If I don't
give it to them,
they're gonna kill me.

218
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,960
Shawn, can I
speak to you outside, please?

219
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,066
I guess.

220
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,638
Dude, what is wrong with you?

221
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,767
Shawn, I don't know
how to break this to you,
but you are not psychic.

222
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,037
Clue me in
on the problem here.

223
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,046
It's a big problem when
the job requires extensive
conversing with the dead.

224
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,309
Gus, what is the question
that she wants answered?

225
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,816
Where is the money, right?

226
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,410
That doesn't require
any actual dead guy chitchat.

227
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,751
We simply trace
his last steps,
do a little research,

228
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,383
ask a few questions,
and bingo!

229
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,220
Stop saying "bingo."
You know how I hate that.

230
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,262
Okay, fine. Yahtzee.

231
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,491
We're not doing it, Shawn.

232
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,324
Mahjong. Gus!

233
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,802
GUS: Mrs. Wilcroft.
Raylene.

234
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,737
Raylene.

235
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,703
Your problem is
outside of our reach.

236
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,348
You are in real danger.

237
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,876
I'd like to recommend
police protection.

238
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,978
I'm pleased
to be of service.

239
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,545
Thank you.
Thank you.

240
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,458
CARLTON:
I know they're in there.

241
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:39,329
Just so you know,
I am uncomfortable
with inter-office romance.

242
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,141
I wasn't considering it.

243
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,008
And I'm completely
uncomfortable with
the implication.

244
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,674
So, it wasn't true,
the rumor about you
and your last partner?

245
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,782
I'm not going to dignify
that with a response.

246
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,787
This is them.
JULIET: The bank robbers?

247
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,825
Yeah, a little
worse for the wear
than the day I arrested them.

248
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,225
You caught them?

249
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,319
I was part of a team,
but, yeah, it was mostly me.

250
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,386
That's a big deal.

251
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,160
Would've been a big deal
if I had found the money
and closed the case.

252
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,531
Things like that
make a career.

253
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,263
Instead, I got a bunch
of loose ends, a dead guy,

254
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,135
and 3.6 million in cash
that vanished into thin air.

255
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,039
It's funny,
they don't look so mean.

256
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,872
What do you mean "mean"?

257
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,036
They look like repairmen.

258
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,513
Big repairmen,
but they don't
look like killers.

259
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:24,742
Duck!

260
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,991
Eyes of a serpent,

261
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,366
ears of a bat.

262
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,833
Send us a signal from...

263
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,166
Shawn.

264
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,334
I hear a voice.

265
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,934
Can I see you outside, please?

266
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,503
It wants me to come outside.

267
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,639
Now?

268
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,615
I should go.

269
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,322
Is that my bathrobe?

270
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,353
What are you doing?

271
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,398
What does it look
like I'm doing?
I'm having a séance.

272
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,763
You can't have a séance!

273
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,530
Gus, there are no rules
against having a séance.
Anyone can have one.

274
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,901
It's like a garage sale.
Or plastic surgery.

275
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,405
Okay, first of all,
technically,

276
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,203
you need to have a permit
to have a garage sale.

277
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,903
Secondly, you cannot
speak to the dead.

278
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:29,072
Oh, Gus, you don't
understand at all, do you?

279
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,082
I don't need to make contact
with the dead.

280
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,516
No, I need to speak
with all the people
in that room.

281
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,678
They're witnesses.

282
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,416
We can piece together
the rest based on
the information they give us.

283
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,287
I'm already on to something.
Check this out.

284
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,555
The dead guy was on the lam
for three days with the cash.
He had help.

285
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,993
From whom?

286
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,095
I'm almost there.

287
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,100
(CHANTING)

288
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,800
Raylene?
Yes, Shawn?

289
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,469
I'm sensing the
last time he called
before the accident.

290
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,341
Ellen was the only
one who talked to him.

291
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,573
Ellen. Yes,
I feel that deeply.

292
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,206
You didn't tell
the police that, did you?

293
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,514
No, I was afraid.
He's my brother.
I didn't want to turn him in.

294
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,578
No, of course not.
Where did he call from?

295
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,854
A pay phone outside a store.

296
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,894
Yes, it was a store,
I feel it. Which store?

297
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,155
I think it was a...
Thriftymart.

298
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,966
Up north. He'd been driving.

299
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,800
(STAMMERING)
I've always imagined
it was the one near Pismo.

300
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:29,534
Pismo! Yes, but
the spirits are confused,

301
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,202
they need more
specific directions.

302
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,906
Nearest cross street?

303
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,545
Just past the park
we used to hike with Roger.

304
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,015
Who's Roger?

305
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,278
He's our cousin.

306
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,213
Really?
But wait, there's more.

307
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,887
The spirits are asking me.
What is Roger's address?

308
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,096
I really haven't
seen Roger in years.

309
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,394
Come on, Ellen!
Work with me! Think harder.

310
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,626
Okay, sorry.

311
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,525
How about a phone number?

312
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,002
Okay.

313
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:03,139
Gus, what have you done?
You've broken the chain
of spiritual trust.

314
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,369
I didn't break anything.

315
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,808
Don't ruin it
for everyone, Gus.

316
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,175
I'm not ruining anything.

317
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,111
Listen, Raylene,
I have to apologize to you.

318
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,739
You seem like
a very decent person.

319
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,977
But what you need
is protection, not this.

320
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,986
A bodyguard, a policeman.

321
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,318
I can assure you,
there is no spirit in here.

322
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,481
What?

323
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,855
And let me make
you a guarantee,
there is absolutely no way

324
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,860
there will be
any sort of contact
with zombies...

325
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,156
(SCREAMING)

326
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,021
(CAR TIRES SCREECHING)

327
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,826
You okay?

328
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,265
I think that's all
for tonight, ladies.

329
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,644
Did you do that?

330
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,381
Why would I ruin
our totally cool window?

331
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,479
For effect,

332
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,524
to make me think
you contacted an evil ghost.

333
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,888
Gus, please.

334
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,327
Why didn't you
float that idea by me sooner?
That's genius.

335
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,499
Somebody obviously
wants us off this case.

336
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,001
I think
it's those convicts.

337
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,934
But whoever it is,
we'll never find them.

338
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,666
I just saw them run off.

339
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,833
You sure about that?
Yeah.

340
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,434
Ladies, stay here.
We're going after them.

341
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,477
Or it.

342
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,972
Let's get some tacos.
Okay.

343
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,552
And then the window
just shattered.

344
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,818
And you think ghosts did it?

345
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:24,913
No. No. No.

346
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,153
Though there may have been
some women present who thought
ghosts were responsible.

347
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,218
I blame it on the two convicts
from the Holmby Bank robbery.

348
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,093
I'm sorry, I still don't
understand why that means

349
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,961
you need to see
the entire case file.

350
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,900
Oh, no, no, Juliet, we don't
need to see the whole thing.
No.

351
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,234
No, just the cover page,
one or two others,
here, there.

352
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,501
Definitely the witness list.
Well, you gotta see that.

353
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,804
And the Chief's
okay with this?
Oh, yeah.

354
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,908
I don't think so.

355
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,211
No?
No.

356
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,782
I liked the other girl better.
Not me.

357
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,216
Hey, since we're here,
we should do some digging.

358
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,556
Good idea, why don't you
dig me getting the hell out
of here

359
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:03,650
and going to get some sleep?

360
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,265
Hey, I set you up for that.

361
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,062
Lobbed it right
over the plate.

362
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,335
(COUGHING)

363
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,113
Mr. Spencer!
Oh!

364
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,078
Hey, you, what a surprise.

365
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,811
You look different.

366
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,046
Yes, I took your advice.

367
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,679
Three weeks
without a cigarette.

368
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,020
Well, it has certainly
enhanced your aura.

369
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,219
And remember,
it wasn't my advice,

370
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,784
it was your grandma's spirit.

371
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:40,126
Have you spoken to her again?

372
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,629
She's here.

373
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:45,861
Now?

374
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,303
Yes.

375
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,238
Where? In this hallway?

376
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,502
No.

377
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,974
In the records room.

378
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,276
I thought I felt
something eerie in there.

379
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,613
Me, too.
Unfortunately, I'm not
allowed down there.

380
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,683
Please.

381
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,520
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not too much light.

382
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,531
You don't want to
scare her away.

383
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,761
Yes.

384
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,261
Oh, yes.

385
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,032
Yes, I can feel her,
all right.

386
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,402
She's...

387
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,701
She's over by the W's.

388
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,473
Why?
No. W.

389
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,308
(GASPS) This is it!

390
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,876
I'm nervous.
Don't be.

391
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,714
I want you to relax. Breathe.

392
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,016
Close your eyes.

393
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,948
Why would she be in the W's?

394
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,492
I don't know.

395
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,118
Did you know any W's?

396
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,458
That bastard Walter.

397
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,793
Walter.

398
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,299
Your ex?

399
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,892
Wow! Yes.

400
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,229
I hear something.

401
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,704
Yes, me, too.

402
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,742
Paper.
No, it's not paper.

403
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,573
Yes, it's clearly paper.

404
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,839
You have to concentrate.

405
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,710
Breathe deeply.

406
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,748
No, uh-uh.

407
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:11,153
I'm definitely not
feeling anything anymore.

408
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,383
I think we've lost her.

409
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,566
I'm so sorry
I couldn't reach her.

410
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:27,270
It's okay.
I know how temperamental
the spirit world can...

411
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,568
Your hand!
Oh!

412
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,732
It was the spirits!
Yes.

413
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,244
It's a message from beyond.
What does it say?

414
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,280
I think I should
keep it to myself.
It's a private message.

415
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,390
Dude, you look so peaceful
when you're sleeping.

416
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,433
Never come
in my apartment again.
You hear me?

417
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,366
I've seen
the Holmby Bank file.

418
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,996
Look, Shawn,
I don't want to...
The cousin is the key.

419
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,567
Which cousin? The one
the sister mentioned?

420
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,201
And then immediately
regretted. You could see it.
She let it slip.

421
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,744
Dude, the guy runs a cemetery.

422
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,781
Which one?
Oh, I don't know, the one
David Wilcroft is buried in?

423
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,612
I'll bet you dollars
to donuts he knows exactly
where the money is.

424
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,879
Look, it's all right here
on my hand.

425
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,555
His name is Roger Blaine,
creepy as all get-out.

426
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,684
Lives on the grounds,
alone, no wife, no kids.

427
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,423
Not that part. That's
the Italian seamstress I met
at the Renaissance fair.

428
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,265
How much further
is this place?

429
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,960
I don't know,
50, 60 miles.

430
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,733
60 miles!

431
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,327
And you didn't get me a donut?

432
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,270
I did get you a donut.
Then I ate it.

433
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,399
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

434
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,706
Solving a crime?
That happens to be
our job description.

435
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,302
No, driving so far on a whim.

436
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,441
A whim, he says.
A guy dies and gets buried
by his own weirdo cousin

437
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,977
in a tiny cemetery way up
the coast in a town
with a population of 200.

438
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,545
That is not a whim,
that is a clue.

439
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,215
You think the
cousin has the money?

440
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,693
Roger Blaine? That even
sounds like an alias.

441
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,094
He could've killed Wilcroft.
Or it could have
been the sister.

442
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,961
Gus, they're all
kind of creepy.

443
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,161
The dead guy, the undertaker,
the sister, Raylene.

444
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,466
Oh, there's nothing
creepy about Raylene.

445
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,472
Nothing creepy about
the melodramatic widow?
No.

446
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,872
Are you serious?
Who marries a bank robber?

447
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,467
Who sees a psychic every week?

448
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,102
There's nothing
wrong with her, Shawn.
Okay.

449
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,511
What is this thing you have
with women in jeopardy?

450
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,608
They have a name for this,
you know. It's called
the Stockholm syndrome.

451
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,152
No, it's not.

452
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,851
Florence Nightingale's
disease?

453
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:26,084
Are you trying to be funny?
You can't ridicule me
because I want to help.

454
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,149
I can when you want
to help too much.

455
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,526
You have an unnatural affinity
for this woman that I simply
cannot wrap my brain around.

456
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,565
She dresses like she's
on her way to a PTA meeting.

457
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,430
Fine. She reminds me
of somebody who was
very important to me.

458
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,230
Who?
Don't worry about it.

459
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,497
Oh, no.
What?

460
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,697
Don't say it.
What?

461
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,070
Don't say
Meredith Baxter Birney!
It's not MBB!

462
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,575
This is unhealthy.
Okay, you were in love
with her, too.

463
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:49,239
I loved her because
she was Mrs. Keaton,
and she gave birth to APK.

464
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,012
It's not her anyway.

465
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,383
Well, who is it?

466
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,445
My babysitter.

467
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,353
Your babysitter.
Yes, my babysitter.

468
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,516
Gus, Mrs. Pilderman
was in her late 60s.

469
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,493
Mrs. Pilderman was
37 years old
and she was a nurse, Shawn.

470
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:07,020
She taught me things, like,
you know, about books and art.
Things like that.

471
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,932
Things like skinny-dipping?
I did not go skinny-dipping
with Mrs. Pilderman!

472
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,993
Well, at least that sheds
some light on it.

473
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,209
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

474
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,438
Huh, nobody's home.

475
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:24,846
No, somebody's here.

476
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,816
You can see through doors now,
that's the new thing?

477
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,580
I can smell
the laundry vent.
No, you can't.

478
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,746
Okay.

479
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,220
(SNIFFING)

480
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,259
Oh, Gus, please
with the supersmeller.
You have to stop!

481
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,959
(BOTH SNIFFING)

482
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,588
Oh, dude, I can smell it, too.
I told you.

483
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:42,031
Jeans and socks and underwear
and a Bounce sheet.

484
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,591
Make jokes. How long
do you think it takes
to dry a load of clothes?

485
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,400
Thirty minutes?
Somebody's here
and not answering the door.

486
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,704
Gus, I apologize.

487
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,767
That's very
impressive detective work.

488
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,210
I feel a little bad
about the donut thing now.
You should.

489
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,078
Dang it!

490
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,146
Let's try the back.

491
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,732
(CROWING)

492
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,738
(WHISPERING) Just stay
and watch. Go on, G.

493
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,544
Whoa!

494
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,384
You're not Roger!

495
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,110
No, no, you're...

496
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,749
You're David Wilcroft.

497
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,189
Aren't you
supposed to be dead?

498
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,191
Gus?

499
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:49,823
Gus?

500
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,705
Look. It's not that easy
to explain.

501
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:59,638
I'm not a real criminal.
I just... I got in
a little over my head.

502
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,540
You robbed a bank.

503
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:02,875
I didn't want to.

504
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,543
I was in a bad place.

505
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,849
They trusted me.
I was supposed
to stash the cash.

506
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,087
You lost the money.

507
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,096
Yeah. How'd you know?

508
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,831
It was raining.
Really hard,
for two whole days.

509
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,970
It was the worst rainstorm
in 30 years.

510
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,267
You couldn't find it.

511
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,206
Yeah. By the time
the roads reopened,

512
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,244
every marker I left was gone,
it was washed away.

513
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:36,109
I lost three and a half
million dollars.

514
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,246
Driving back,
I nearly drove off the road.

515
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,181
It was then I realized
I'd be better off dead.

516
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,186
And you have been
digging ever since.

517
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,814
Every chance I can
get out there without
the risk of being seen

518
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,290
by hikers or
mountain bikers, I dig.

519
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,953
You know what?
Raylene is in agony
over this.

520
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,760
I didn't mean her any harm.

521
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,422
You were never
gonna tell her?
I couldn't.

522
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,489
Excuse us a moment.
What?

523
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:59,628
Gus, what's happening with you
and this guy's wife?

524
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,561
Are you having
feelings for this woman?

525
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,370
That's ridiculous.
No, no, Gus.
Gus, this is wonderful.

526
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,503
Look, we didn't know he was
alive. When she came to us
she was technically available.

527
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,342
Shawn. Stop it.
I'm not hitting on
your wife.

528
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,780
No, he's not. But there's
some serious crushing
going on here.

529
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,683
Dude, I am not blind.
"A man with many hats
doesn't like his haircut"?

530
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:15,913
(STAMMERING)
What book is that from?

531
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,545
She's a charming woman.
A charming woman?

532
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,714
Oh, you're Jane Austen now?

533
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,088
She's an adult,
she is attractive,
she's mature.

534
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,560
Shawn...
David, help me out here,
tell him that this is healthy.

535
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,654
Raylene is a
very dynamic woman.

536
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,323
Everybody is drawn to her.

537
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,867
Look, guys,

538
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:35,202
I know you want to turn me in.
But you gotta understand
I'm close. I am so very close.

539
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,470
I've covered nearly every inch
inside the Kalish trail loop
where I buried it.

540
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,068
And you want us
to let you find it?

541
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,047
Get her to hide someplace,
someplace safe.

542
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,811
I just want to return
the money and
get on with my life.

543
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:47,874
Hmm?

544
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,389
We have to
think this through.
Yeah.

545
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:57,484
You know, in my mind,
they were the lucky ones,

546
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:01,361
they got to go to prison,
pay off their
debt to society.

547
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,592
I've been living
as a dead man.

548
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,432
If Raylene's going to
find out that I'm alive,

549
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,635
at the very least, don't
let it come from a stranger,
let it come from me.

550
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,069
GUS: We're letting him go?

551
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,113
He's not going anywhere
until he finds that money.

552
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,081
I doubt that'll be
anytime soon.

553
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:19,548
He did have
cool hair, though.

554
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,449
God, we're missing
something else here!

555
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,044
He's the key
to solving this puzzle.

556
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,315
We need to tell Raylene.

557
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:27,449
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're
holding all the cards here,
Gus. Why would we do that?

558
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,824
Because she's in danger.
Maybe we can fix that.

559
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,789
GUS: Your husband, he's alive.

560
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,495
Gus! Remember the part where
we weren't going to tell her?

561
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,798
We never said that!

562
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,168
David's alive?

563
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,139
We found him.
He's with his cousin.

564
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:46,377
Roger? No, no, no.
That can't be.

565
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,647
I'm sure your head is spinning
and that you don't feel
completely safe right now.

566
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,183
But rest assured,
we do have a plan.

567
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,350
We are gonna put
the convicts back in jail.

568
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,517
Where they belong.
And are gonna
stay for a while.

569
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,526
CARLTON: We'll put these
guys behind bars,
where they belong.

570
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,668
So who authorized
this stakeout?

571
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,369
What?

572
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,236
You know, who set it up?

573
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,748
I did.
I mean, who sanctioned it?

574
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,374
Approved it? Above you.

575
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,281
Above me? You know,
I don't think I like
where this is going.

576
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,846
I just mean it should be
officially sanctioned
as per the police code.

577
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,323
Which one?

578
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,855
11A-17.

579
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,053
Ticky-tack. Doesn't apply.

580
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:39,460
In most cases someone
still has to authorize it.

581
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,557
Oh, that's right,
I remember now. I did!

582
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,727
Well, what about <i>4</i>2.211?
What about it?

583
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,964
Well, it states that...
It's superseded by 15.75.

584
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,164
Not necessarily.

585
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,469
If you're in
the jurisdiction
of a 23.<i>4</i>0, it is.

586
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,305
Maybe.
Maybe?

587
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,505
Technically, a 23.<i>4</i>0 only
applies in federal cases.

588
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,911
What are you doing in here?

589
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,507
I thought we could share info.
What are we looking at?

590
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:00,949
Get the hell out of my car!

591
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:05,649
Shouldn't you be wondering how
I slid in and lounged for two
minutes without you noticing?

592
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,749
You're new and pretty,
so it's okay.

593
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,918
You've got ten seconds

594
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,985
before I latch the doors
and haul you down
to the station.

595
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,530
They don't know
where the money is.
What?

596
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:16,863
Isn't that why you're
following them? So they'll
lead you to the money?

597
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,194
Psychic. It's amazing.
You'll get used to it.

598
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:25,473
Look, the dead guy buried
the money and then lost it,
but that's beside the point.

599
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:30,139
I think we can cut our losses,
put those two back behind
bars, if we work together.

600
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,944
And how do we do that?

601
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:35,509
Well, first, we dress
up as musketeers
and make a very special pact.

602
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,954
Come on, you've watched
them pull at least a handful
of probation violations.

603
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,185
You've been tailing them.
You saw what
they did to my office.

604
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,851
They haven't been anywhere
near your office.

605
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:46,658
They were near enough to bust
out my window two nights ago.
No, you're wrong.

606
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,763
You lost them, anyway.

607
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,702
We'll talk tomorrow.

608
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,904
Bye, Juliet.

609
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:14,885
They don't want our help?

610
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,554
Of course they don't.
But they also lost our guys.
Did you see where they went?

611
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,157
Did I see where they went?
You mean did I see their car
turn right on Riverside?

612
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,497
Or did I see the parking tag
from the 2<i>4</i>00 Motel?

613
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:28,096
<i>Touché!</i>
Did you see what kind of
whiskey they bought?

614
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,368
Shawn, please.
Time is being wasted.

615
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,607
This is breaking
and entering.

616
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,548
No, no, no.
Only if we break something.

617
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:43,485
And then enter something.
Entering is just entering.

618
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,749
I'm not breaking
a law, Shawn.

619
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,222
Look, you wanna save
your little widow?

620
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,191
We've got to find
some evidence
to put these guys away.

621
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,658
I'm standing firm on this.

622
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,562
Fine, what about the window?

623
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,360
If it just opens,
does that count?

624
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,491
Depends.

625
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,593
Ooh. Hey, I see something.

626
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,728
Shawn?

627
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,135
I might be able to slide
this chain off.

628
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,639
Shawn?
Gus, I'm trying
to concentrate.

629
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,699
You might wanna
turn around.
What? Whoa!

630
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,775
You guys parked
round back, huh?

631
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,184
Okay, okay!

632
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,390
Was that really necessary?
Were we resisting?

633
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,854
Man, window inspector?
In a motel?

634
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,866
Okay, I lied. I did.
I'm sorry.

635
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,062
The truth is I'm a psychic.

636
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:36,766
That's what I do.
Perhaps you've read about me
in the paper recently.

637
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,672
I've been in jail four years.

638
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,735
You don't have papers?
I thought you guys had TV

639
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,974
and yard darts
and mahjong and...

640
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:48,012
(STAMMERING) Okay,
I come bearing a message

641
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,651
from a departed being.

642
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,611
David Wilcroft

643
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,325
wants you to know
that he lost the money.

644
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,392
It's gone forever.

645
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,759
Why you telling us this?

646
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,661
(STAMMERING) He is concerned

647
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,860
that you're going to harm
Rins... Racquel...

648
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,692
Raylene.
Raylene.

649
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,634
Oh, that's funny.

650
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,535
(ALL LAUGHING)

651
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,569
That is funny.

652
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:19,008
Jesse, can you make sure
that we are not disturbed?

653
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,582
You can...

654
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,215
Can you prove
you're a psychic?

655
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,283
Sure. Sure.

656
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,295
You are a bank robber.

657
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,355
Yes, you did not like prison.

658
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,836
You are wearing the same pants
that you were released in,

659
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:46,138
and you have packed
on a few pounds since being...

660
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,840
No, look, man, I'm talking
about real proof!
Like a test.

661
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,212
Now, look, if you're right,
you live. If you're wrong...

662
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,577
Man, you don't
wanna be wrong.

663
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:01,455
Here's the thing.
It's not really
a parlor trick.

664
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,461
No.
(STAMMERING) And I don't
want to cheapen it.

665
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,496
Look, prove it now. Let's go.

666
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:07,758
What's wrong with you,
man? Move!

667
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,094
Okay! Okay!

668
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,897
How many fingers?

669
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,603
How many fingers?

670
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,969
Are you kidding?

671
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,574
Do I look like
I'm joking around?
How many fingers?

672
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,546
We gotta be able
to come up with
something better than that.

673
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,173
All right, man. Time's up.

674
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,782
Four.

675
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,025
All right, how many now?

676
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,885
Two. Now can we move on?

677
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,192
Because Gus and I
have some questions that we...

678
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,625
Three. For instance,
why was it so funny...

679
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:46,931
Three.

680
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,873
And is it possible...
Still three.

681
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,237
Now it's technically
two and a half fingers.

682
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:56,712
And the guy with the gun
is flipping me the bird.

683
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,214
You can see my fingers,
can't you?

684
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,945
No. No.
Yes, yes, yes, I can.

685
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:05,888
It's the reflection of the TV
bouncing off the mirror
to the water pitcher here.

686
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,617
All right. Okay, maybe not.
We're gonna try this
one more time.

687
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,457
Now, how many fingers?

688
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:28,805
Dude, you need
to stop picking three.

689
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,977
Respect, man.

690
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,121
Gee. Oh, man! That's...

691
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,003
Yep. They're back here.

692
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,198
I can't believe we lost them.

693
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,632
Don't think
that wasn't on purpose.

694
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,542
SHAWN: To Wilcroft.
A hell of a wheel man.

695
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,103
He was the wheel man?

696
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,116
Yeah. You should
know that, right?

697
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,778
Well, Shawn's visions
sometimes are scattered.
Incomplete.

698
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:12,152
How does a wheel man miss
a turn on a mountain road?

699
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,783
(LAUGHS) I tell you what,
he didn't miss that turn.

700
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,191
I bet he just
drove straight off.
You wanna know why?

701
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:20,719
Because he was trying
to get away from his wife.

702
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,865
Damn, you're good.

703
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,360
No, no. That can't be,
why would he be...

704
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,132
We called her the Viper.
Man, she was cold as hell.

705
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,572
We had to do
whatever she said, man.
We had no choice.

706
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:31,869
Who?
The wife.

707
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,070
Raylene?
You know her?

708
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:37,046
Well, she came to us,
she wanted to contact David.

709
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,481
Figures. That was
her only weakness.

710
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,417
The occult. Man,
she'd stop at nothing to get
her hands on that money.

711
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:45,354
No, she only wanted the money
to protect herself
from you two.

712
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:46,822
From us?
Yeah.

713
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,516
(BOTH LAUGHING)

714
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,860
Man, the last thing
we would ever do is cross her.

715
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,726
All we wanted to do
was get away from her.

716
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,356
Especially David.

717
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,869
Man, she ran him around
like he was an animal.
He did whatever she said.

718
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:00,927
Look, man, I don't
know if you guys
got caught up

719
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:02,768
in the charm
or whatever,

720
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,775
but I'll tell you, man,
that was her key.
She could play anybody.

721
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,869
I'm telling you
she is a very dangerous lady.

722
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,971
Raylene was the mastermind?

723
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,343
(WHOOPS)

724
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,546
I already knew that.
Because I'm a psychic.

725
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,315
Come on, guys. We should go.

726
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,556
You don't want
to go out that way.

727
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:21,683
Why?

728
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,326
We got company outside.

729
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,055
SHAWN: Is there another
way out of here?

730
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,360
GUS:
I can't believe I just crawled
through a bathroom window.

731
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,702
It has to be a lie.

732
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,706
Gus, you're attracted
to dangerous women, man.
It happens.

733
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,875
Joan Jett, for example.

734
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,535
Penny Marshall.
Grace Jones.

735
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,408
Or the woman who played
Pinky Tuscadero.

736
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,879
She seemed so sincere.

737
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,276
So vulnerable, you know?

738
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:48,216
Yeah! Turns out she's
a domineering snake lady

739
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:51,414
who drove her
browbeaten husband
to fake his own death.

740
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,890
And we, we led her right
to the poor bastard.

741
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,554
Lizzie Borden,
Kathy Bates!

742
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,100
Raylene! This is not you...

743
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,105
Whoa! What, today's gun day?

744
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,734
Sit.

745
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,346
"Just rush in here."
Bad idea, Shawn.

746
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,644
Let her hang herself.

747
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,751
Quiet.

748
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:27,123
Raylene, I am sensing
that this is going
to end very, very badly.

749
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,185
Find me my money.

750
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,291
I know you have it.

751
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,693
He doesn't have it.

752
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,253
I'm the only one
who knows where the money is.

753
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,391
Whoa! He doesn't know
where the money is.

754
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,491
Of course I know
where the money is.

755
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:40,503
Shawn, I don't know
what your strategy is, but you
don't know where the money is.

756
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,438
You have five seconds.
One...

757
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,066
Really? The countdown?
Two...

758
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,337
Three!

759
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,901
Okay, it's in the crypt!

760
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,745
The money's in the crypt?

761
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,841
Well, David here
certainly isn't.
Think about it, Raylene.

762
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,386
Roger runs the place.
It's the perfect
hiding spot.

763
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,820
They can get in and out
whenever they want.

764
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,058
Pry it open.
With what?

765
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,650
With the stanchion.

766
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,164
Apparently those are
called stanchions, Gus,
were you aware of this?

767
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,359
Yes, I was.

768
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:13,198
How did you figure out
that money was in the crypt?
I'm bluffing.

769
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,761
This is not a good
time to bluff!

770
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,830
I think it's a great time!
She was going to kill us.

771
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:20,503
And besides, I've always
thought a crypt was a great
place to stash loot, you know?

772
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,513
It's kind of like a vault,
I mean, you can just get in
there whenever you need to.

773
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,139
She's gonna figure
out you're lying.

774
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,242
Eventually. But, come on,
it's gonna take a while
to bust open a crypt.

775
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,616
(CRASHING)

776
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,388
Wow. Not as long
as I was hoping for.

777
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,720
Help him get it out.

778
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,255
Raylene, please.
What are you waiting for?

779
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,059
(DOOR OPENS)
That.

780
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,424
Son of a...
David?

781
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,602
I don't believe this.

782
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,540
Well, what are you
going to do, Raylene?
Shoot all of us?

783
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,544
None of you are armed.
I can do whatever I want.

784
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,746
Really now?

785
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,478
Drop it.

786
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,512
You, move away
from the stanchion.

787
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,085
What took you so long?

788
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,387
Shut up!

789
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,764
He does have nice hair.

790
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,428
Yeah, that takes a lot of
upkeep, though, man.

791
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,937
Yeah.
You gotta worry
about split ends...

792
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,337
Dandruff.
Dandruff.

793
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,673
It's horrible.
It's awful.

794
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,176
Yeah. Let's get out of here.

795
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:34,651
The Wilcrofts are not talking
at all to our investigators.

796
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,120
We get indications from their
lawyers that they will plead
the fifth to all charges,

797
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:41,625
which leaves me
with a whole slew
of loose ends.

798
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,721
For instance,
Detective Lassiter,

799
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,786
could you tell me how you made
the discovery that David
Wilcroft was still alive?

800
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:50,356
Well, actually, Chief,
we never made
that connection, per se.

801
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,992
We were on a stakeout...

802
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,559
Yes, I see that.

803
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:57,665
You describe it
as "harrowing and intense."

804
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,140
I'm sorry,
those were my words.

805
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:01,906
You wanted me
to spell-check it.

806
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,573
I still don't understand
how that connected you
to David Wilcroft.

807
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,117
Well, that's where
we come in, Chief,
some good work was done...

808
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,879
By Detective Lassiter.

809
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,119
He was amazing.

810
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,349
He figured out there was
a connection to Roger Blaine,

811
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,257
the cousin, who was involved
with the faking of the death.

812
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:21,458
Burnt body, no DNA,
pretty convenient,
he deducted.

813
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,056
I never said that.

814
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,625
No, but you thought it.
That's how good
you are, Lassy.

815
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:29,434
You practically solved this
entire case up here without
uttering a spoken word.

816
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:32,965
I did nothing of the kind.
I was following the money
and protecting Raylene.

817
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,568
Who turned out
to be the dangerous one.

818
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,842
Which I picked up
from Detective Lassiter's
massive brain.

819
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,075
Not true.

820
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,879
True.
Not.

821
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,077
It was so!

822
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,484
Gentlemen, please.

823
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,149
So we still have no idea
where the money is?

824
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,256
I got nothing from him.
But if he figures anything
out I'll be the first to know.

825
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,693
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

826
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,889
We're going to have
a private conversation.

827
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,825
I know what you're doing.

828
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,333
Giving you credit?
You're trying to get me
to admit you're psychic.

829
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,302
You've already done that.
No, I haven't.

830
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,264
You're right.
I'm sorry, you didn't
actually say it.

831
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:08,176
Spencer, no matter what
you do, I will never, never
ever say those words.

832
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,542
Which words?

833
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:10,807
You know which words.

834
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,315
No, man, I lost
my train of thought.
Which words?

835
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,855
Oh,

836
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,515
(LOUDLY) that you think
I'm a psychic.

837
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,153
Those words?

838
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:24,888
So when are you going to
tell them where the money is?

839
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,395
I don't know
where the money is.

840
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:31,333
Sure you do.
You're seeing dirt.

841
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,998
Am I right?
No!

842
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,535
What am I going to say now?

843
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,182
What are we doing here?

844
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:56,124
It's Saturday,
I thought we'd
get some fresh air.

845
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,593
We drove an hour out of town
to get some fresh air?

846
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,186
Well, there's that,

847
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,264
and we're gonna find
the dread pirate
Wilcroft's dirty booty.

848
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,501
Shawn, the guy's been digging
for four years.

849
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,940
We're gonna find it
in one afternoon?

850
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,705
Ninety minutes. Tops.

851
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,577
And I brought some chicken
for a hearty snack.

852
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,047
And how do you
plan on finding it?

853
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:22,950
Well, he said he dug every
inch of the Kalish Loop after
he buried it here. Right?

854
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,578
Yes. Three miles' worth.

855
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,452
But it was dark
and it had rained.

856
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,584
And he said he thought
it was right off the path,
he may have gotten lost.

857
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,684
I heard the story, Shawn.

858
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:35,391
Did he realize there's
a J. Kalish
and an L. Kalish trail?

859
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,102
Dude, it's completely defunct.
Check it out,

860
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:44,005
only used by the rangers for
back fires, medical access,
mud slide emergency routes,

861
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:47,271
like, for instance,
during a torrential rainstorm.

862
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:51,012
Otherwise, it's gated
and it looks completely
abandoned from the road.

863
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,985
Okay, I find it,
I get credit.

864
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,222
I'm the psychic,
I have to get a vibration.

865
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,756
"Chief?" "Yes?"

866
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:06,288
"I'm getting
a trailhead, a pathway.

867
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,459
"And something else."
"What is it?"

868
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,795
"Chicken bones.

869
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,733
"Yes, tandoori style.

870
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,239
"Fresh!" "Oh, I bet
they were delicious."

871
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,368
"Yes."

872
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:30,513
<i>In between the lines</i>
<i>there's a lot of obscurity</i>

873
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,955
<i>I'm not inclined</i>
<i>to resign to maturity</i>

874
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:37,219
<i>If it's all right</i>
<i>then you're all wrong</i>

875
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,525
<i>But why bounce around</i>
<i>to the same damn song?</i>

876
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:46,102
<i>You'd rather run</i>
<i>when you can't crawl</i>

877
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,775
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>That I'm not telling the truth</i>

878
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,936
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>They just don't have any proof</i>

879
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,277
<i>Embrace the deception</i>
<i>Learn how to bend</i>

880
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,285
<i>Your worst inhibitions</i>
<i>tend to psych you out</i>
<i>in the end</i>

881
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,218
<i>I know, you know</i>

882
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,721
<i>I know, you know</i>
