it's a 10 minute ride

to get the other girls

00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,814
You withheld evidence.

335
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:37,419
And by conspiring with Bianca
we can charge you with
involuntary manslaughter.

336
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,894
You understand that's a crime?

337
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,067
I know!

338
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,728
No!

339
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,338
(GASPS)

340
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,515
(GROANS)

341
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,618
You actually
slept here last night?

342
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,923
Yes, I did,
it's called crunch time.

343
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,922
Have you checked the messages?
Have we heard from Juliet?

344
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,762
Yeah. Alice Bundy's alibi
is airtight.

345
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,869
She lives with
Doreen's family.

346
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,770
Said she went upstairs
to bed early that night
and the parents confirmed it,

347
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,774
they were still downstairs
awake when the police called.

348
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,207
Who the hell's doing this?

349
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,245
Oh. And your dad called.

350
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,306
What could he possibly want?

351
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,246
Said he wanted to remind you
about dinner tonight.

352
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,409
You're supposed
to bring dessert.

353
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:34,816
He actually seemed
sort of excited.

354
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,945
Oh, God, that's tonight.

355
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,149
Dude, you have to come.

356
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,658
Oh, I don't know
about that, Shawn.

357
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,127
It seems like
a pretty big deal,
him reaching out and all.

358
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,458
I wouldn't want to intrude.

359
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,728
Gus, he loves you.
He always has.

360
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,266
Plus, if you come
we can roll earlier.

361
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,858
We'll say we're
working on a case.

362
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,200
We are working on a case.
Sweet. So, it's settled.

363
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,603
What are you doing?
I have to start and
ultimately finish my route.

364
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,073
Awesome.

365
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,604
I'm going to find
Alice "best friend" Bundy.

366
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,237
Don't you think that girl has
been through enough, Shawn?

367
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,442
Gus, there is no such thing
as an air tight alibi.

368
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,678
And if there is, we're going
to pretend like there isn't.

369
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,586
This girl is Sharon Stone
from <i>Basic Instinct.</i>

370
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:13,954
Which makes me Michael Douglas
and you George Dzundza.

371
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,926
Who's name is
actually Gus in the film.

372
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,994
Until we have another lead,
we assume it's her.

373
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,693
We've just got to
figure out the "how."
So far, no ice pick.

374
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:27,299
First of all, don't ever
compare my black ass
to George Dzundza again, okay?

375
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,135
Fair.
And what can you
possibly ask that girl

376
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:30,299
that the police
already haven't?

377
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,607
Wanna split a pineapple?
I'm sorry, do I know you?

378
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,615
My name is Ichibod Fletchman.
Sticky Icky to my boys. But
that's neither here nor there.

379
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:44,451
What's important is that
this baby is 82% Hawaiian
and I've got all afternoon.

380
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,423
Are you a crazy person?

381
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,862
It's funny I was about
to ask you the same thing.

382
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,524
Only I was going to add
"who likes to make toast"
to the end of mine.

383
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,324
Great. So you're
another cop then?

384
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,401
Not a cop.
Not even close.

385
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:00,802
Then who are you?

386
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:10,307
Hint. Green Day there
is about to eat some stone.

387
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,450
How did you do that?

388
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,984
I'm a psychic.
Pass.

389
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,916
Oh, come on.

390
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,025
I was trying to be cool.

391
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,357
What do you want from me?

392
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,759
You want to read my palm?

393
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,994
You want a lock of hair?

394
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,362
Alice.

395
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,968
I can feel that
you're hurting.

396
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,234
Really?
Can you feel that I'm hurting?

397
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:40,207
Come on, psychic,
you can do better than that.
Can't you?

398
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,671
Do you have a best friend?
I do.

399
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,112
Since birth, almost.
Great.

400
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,947
Then maybe you can
wrap your head around this.

401
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,510
Doreen and I
were closer than sisters.

402
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,114
Her parents took me in
when I was seven.

403
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:56,649
Seven. They raised me.
We did everything together.

404
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:01,158
The one time I wasn't there,
the one time I let her down,

405
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,129
and now she's gone.

406
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,396
I know that if anything
ever happened to Gus...

407
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,005
I would... I don't know.

408
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,473
(STUTTERING)

409
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:14,105
Look, do you really think
I killed that girl?

410
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:16,875
Do you?

411
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:21,652
I understand your suspicion,
but I'm barely
hanging on here,

412
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,381
and I just don't think that...

413
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,254
I'm not a murderer.

414
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,585
Well, I certainly hope not
for your sake.

415
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,657
Someone came in
and emptied the cash register
when I was in the back.

416
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,601
You're not writing this down?

417
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:42,238
Who's got
the arthritic thumb here?

418
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,643
I hitchhiked from Jersey
to Havana when I was 19.

419
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,042
(MUMBLING)

420
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,711
They also got away
with about $60 worth
of rump roast.

421
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:54,775
Don't try to sell me
on that nonsense, you punk.

422
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:58,117
What? You think this is
my first square dance?

423
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,121
(GRUNTING)

424
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,721
Give me your gun, Lassiter.

425
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,959
I'll show you how to
make this little pig squeal.

426
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,695
You just gonna let him go?

427
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,293
He's the victim, Goochberg!

428
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,736
Fine. Fine.
I'll do it myself.

429
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,504
Mary Lou, wait!

430
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,149
I totally almost forgot
to give this to you.

431
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,811
What is it, Eden?
I don't know.

432
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:32,288
It was left on the stoop
like a little baby orphan.

433
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,419
"God's gift is forgiveness.

434
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,463
"Please join us
in remembering our daughter.

435
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,432
"Your attendance
would be greatly appreciated."

436
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,264
Tonight? Hello! Plans.

437
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,332
Bye.
Bye.

438
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,002
Boy, we really
should be going.

439
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,071
Come on, guys. Shawn, stay.

440
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,274
Your case will still be there.

441
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,150
The sooner we can crack
this case and move on
the better. Believe me.

442
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,811
This wouldn't have
anything to do

443
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,948
with the
Wispy Sunny Pines suicide
now, would it?

444
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,191
No.
Yes, sir.

445
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,193
(EXCLAIMING)

446
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,363
Ooh, the plot thickens.

447
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,160
Okay. It's true, fine.

448
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,495
And it hits
a little close to home

449
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,901
seeing as how we were there
the first time it happened.

450
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,265
First time what happened?

451
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,110
Did you open your eyes?

452
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,748
Dad, you've known me
my whole life.
Of course, I opened my eyes.

453
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,909
Shawn, that is why
I used to refuse to let you
ride around with me.

454
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,509
Dad, let it go, I was nine.

455
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,817
It's a lack of respect.
Of protocol.

456
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:41,154
Of protocol?
Again, can I plead
nine years old?

457
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,159
And you guys
have been freaked out
about this your entire lives?

458
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,327
I don't even drive
by that place.

459
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,337
I really don't think
it's funny.

460
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:57,341
It was a very scary thing
for two young boys.

461
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,602
It certainly puts a new spin
on the nanny in <i>The Omen.</i>

462
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,667
You know that's right.

463
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,872
Shawn, how much did you see?

464
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:07,844
I didn't exactly see it.

465
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,020
Luckily, he missed
the bitter, grisly end.

466
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,215
Luckily?
Yes, luckily.

467
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,225
I covered his eyes
but we know what happened.

468
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,384
Oh, I beg to differ.

469
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:21,262
It seems you two missed
one very small
but important detail.

470
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,130
She never jumped.

471
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,398
What? No.

472
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,706
No, that's impossible.

473
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,370
We saw the window,
she was gone.

474
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:39,747
Yeah. Because one off-duty
police officer
pulled her back inside.

475
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,021
Scary Sherry Craddock
was rehabilitated.

476
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,421
I'm pretty sure
she's married
and lives in Fresno.

477
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,929
Come on, guys,
give me some credit.

478
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:57,764
I have no idea how that
ridiculous urban legend got
started in the first place.

479
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:04,933
Your big ass mouth.

480
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,374
I wanted to keep it a secret.

481
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:10,005
You're the one
who was broadcasting it
at the lunch table.

482
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,339
I can't believe this.

483
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,145
We actually started
an urban legend.

484
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,549
That's dope.

485
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:19,684
Sometimes, Shawn,
the answer is
right in front of your eyes.

486
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,386
You just need to choose
to see it.

487
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,790
That was creepy.

488
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,465
SHAWN: This is it.
Alice's house.

489
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:36,439
I know there's something here,
I just got to find it.

490
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,636
Here's the plan.
You ring the doorbell
and distract who...

491
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,305
Who...
Whom... Who...

492
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,778
The person.
The person that answers
the door.

493
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,612
I go around back
and look for a way in.

494
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:47,708
Are you kidding?

495
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,583
It took you the whole ride
to come up with that?

496
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,985
Feel free to make revisions.

497
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,113
How am I supposed
to distract them?

498
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,021
You'll think of something.
Good luck.

499
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,855
We're all counting on you.

500
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,688
(DOORBELL RINGING)

501
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,155
Mrs. Harthan?
No.

502

00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,957
GUS: (LAUGHING)
You sick mother...

673
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,589
SHAWN:
Dude, we could hear you
from the fourth floor.

674
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,689
GUS: Don't lie! Don't lie!

675
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,271
GUS: Hey, Lassie.

676
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:18,026
<i>In between the lines</i>
<i>there's a lot of obscurity</i>

677
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,568
<i>I'm not inclined</i>
<i>to resign to maturity</i>

678
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:25,003
<i>If it's all right</i>
<i>then you're all wrong</i>

679
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:28,533
<i>But why bounce around</i>
<i>to the same damn song?</i>

680
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,846
<i>You'd rather run</i>
<i>when you can't crawl</i>

681
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,515
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>That I'm not telling the truth</i>

682
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,559
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>They just don't have any proof</i>

683
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,823
<i>Embrace the deception</i>
<i>Learn how to bend</i>

684
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,957
<i>Your worst inhibitions</i>
<i>tend to psych you out</i>
<i>in the end</i>

685
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,729
<i>I know, you know</i>

686
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,198
<i>I know, you know</i>
