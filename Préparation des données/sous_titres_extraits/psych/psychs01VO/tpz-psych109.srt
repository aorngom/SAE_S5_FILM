00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,795
Everyone stay
together, please.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,600
Our next stop
is the primate habitat.

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,004
You hear that,
Trish?
Monkeys.

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,973
We're going
to visit
your family.

5
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,135
Knock
it off,
Shawn.

6
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:15,113
Now, some people believe
that the next animal
we're going to see

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,775
is the ugliest creature
in the whole
animal kingdom.

8
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,946
Does anybody
want to guess
which animal that is?

9
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,686
It's definitely
got to be
Trish!

10
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,816
I hate you,
Shawn Spencer!

11
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,086
Shawn!

12
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,062
BOY:
I wonder what it is!

13
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,623
(OSTRICH SQUAWKING)
BOY: Whoa.

14
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,738
Miss Bodansky,
I think the ostrich
might be choking.

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,470
(CHOKING)

16
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,912
Oh, I wouldn't
worry.

17
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,348
I'm sure
it's just eating.

18
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,178
Yeah, that's...

19
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:56,245
That's how
they swallow
their food.

20
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:59,086
I'm pretty sure
that's not food.

21
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,794
A tennis ball,
Shawn? What are
you thinking?

22
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,126
What are you doing
throwing a tennis ball
at an ostrich?

23
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,429
The thing could have died,
and the zoo would have
made me pay for it.

24
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,704
I don't even know
what an ostrich costs.

25
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,568
I didn't do it.
I didn't throw the ball!

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,438
Stop lying, Shawn.
You're only making
things worse!

27
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,101
Maybe he's
telling
the truth.

28
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,044
Are you, Shawn?
Are you telling
the truth?

29
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,513
Yes, sir.

30
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,777
Did you see
who did throw it?

31
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,319
No, sir.

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,417
But I think it might have
been an accident. I think
they meant to hit me.

33
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,894
I believe him.
He's telling the truth.

34
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,830
With all due respect,
Captain, you call the shots
at work, not here.

35
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,665
You deal with your kid.
I'll deal with mine.

36
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,764
You, scoot over.

37
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,336
I believe you, Shawn.

Isn't that...
Trish Connors?

43
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,859
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
and her dad.

44
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:13,990
Whoa!

45
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,329
Wow, she looks...

46
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,459
Hot!

47
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,533
I was going to say
vulnerable, maybe
a little upset, but...

48
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:26,170
I mean, she was cute
in high school,
but she sure has grown.

(EXCLAIMS)

50
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:31,081
I wonder what Trish
and Captain Connors
are talking about?

51
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,812
Why don't I just
read her lips?

52
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,410
'Cause you can't.
Sure, I can.

53
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,545

If we're gonna do
the lip-reading game,

65
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,805
we have to say things
that are at least
remotely believable.

don't remember
me...

Don't speak!
Oh!

74
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,334

a face...

the past.

76

each other.

Yes, we do.

I said
no speaking.
Oh, sorry.

00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,305

80
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,676
classmates.

Yes! Sorry.

be coming from the

it is so good
to see you again, sir.

Please,
come in, guys!

97
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,117
Sit down
in our cushy
chair!

98
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,719
Dad, you remember
Shawn and Gus, we went
to high school together.

99
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,263
I know who
they are.

100
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,995
That's
Henry's boy.

101
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:32,568
You don't have
to speak to me
as though I'm a child.

102
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,131
Now, the
reason that

103
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,109
we came
to see you

104
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,805
is that there
is a...

105
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,415
Um...

106
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,553
Dad, do you
want me to hold
something or...

107
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,954
No, no,
not now,
please.

108
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,186
I have to just...
Oh, damn it!

109
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,494
Nobody breathe.
I'm seeing something.

110
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,600
Gus.

111
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,338
There was
violence.

112
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:15,905
Murder.

113
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,313
Yes.
There was a murder.

114
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,577
Yes, exactly!

115
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,846
A murder,
a 187,
and I solved it.

116
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,547
You bet your ass!

117
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,755
So, what
do you need
us for?

118
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,054
Because, damn it,
I can't remember
who's been killed!

119
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,651
Or who
the killer was.

120
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,289
Did you go to the police?
Oh, they're useless,
all of them.

121
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,663
Without evidence,
they won't even
speak to you.

122
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,497
Thirty years
I spent on
that force.

123
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,537
But they still refuse
to believe me
when I tell them

124
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,596
that there was
a murder, and that
I solved it!

125
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,404
But I'm having
trouble
remembering...

126
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,243
Actually,
remembering
anything.

127
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,744
That's why
I'm here. To see
if you could...

128
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,915
Maybe you could
look into my head.

129
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,217
See what
I can't find there.

130
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,523
But you believe me,
don't you?

131
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,395
Yes, sir.

132
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,823
I believe you.

133
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:16,332
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>That I'm not telling the truth</i>

134
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,469
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>They just don't have any proof</i>

135
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,938
<i>Embrace the deception</i>
<i>Learn how to bend</i>

136
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,442
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend</i>
<i>to psych you out in the end</i>

137
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,318
So, your Trish
says that this is where
her father comes

138
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,920
every morning
for his coffee.

139
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,192
He was here when
he thought he
saw the murder.

140
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,290
So?

141
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,335
So, maybe we'll
see something that
led an ex-cop to believe

142
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,234
a murder had
been committed.

143
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:49,905
Plus, double-chocolate
mango-pineapple scones.

144
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,637
Apparently
made fresh daily.

145
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,078
What I'm saying, Gus,
the morning is essentially
a win-win.

146
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,246
Oh, no!

147
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,649
What?
Little "i"s.

148
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,483
Gus, little "i"s,
little "i"s.
We gotta go!

149
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,487
What?
Little "i"s!

150
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,854
What about Connors?
What about the double-
chocolate mango-pineapple?

151
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,949
Forget the scones.

152
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,288
There's only one
person I know
who makes the...

153
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,988
Don't rush off
on my account!

154
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,319
Dad!

155
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,932
Shawn, you remember
my old captain,
Brett Connors.

156
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,366
Of course.
Captain Connors,

157
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,630
how are you, sir?

158
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:21,264
Look at you fellas,
all grown up! How
long's it been, huh?

159
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,934
About a day.
Less,
actually.

160
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,274
Excuse me?

161
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,510
Yes, can I help you?

162
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,383
I don't know.
My name is
Sabrina.

163
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,444
Vito.

164
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,921
Sabrina Vito.

165
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,721
And I think that
my boyfriend might
be missing.

166
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,230
He hasn't called
and he won't
answer the phone

167
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,257
and I'm a little afraid
that something might
have happened.

168
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,394
So, I've been putting
these up all over town.

169
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,167
It's okay.
Why don't you come over
here and sit down?

170
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,332
Okay.

171
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,432
Oh, that's right,
that's right.

172
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,239
That's right, this chick
was sunbathing naked
in the plaza.

173
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,301
No!

174
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,815
You should have
seen your old man

175
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,713
chasing her
with the cuffs.

176
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,480
This gal was so covered
with suntan oil,

177
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:10,488
every time he grabbed her
she squirted right out
of his hands.

178
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,524
(ALL LAUGHING)

179
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,356
CONNORS:
And that reminds me
of that 502

180
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,962
that we picked up
that New Year's Eve,
over on Olive Avenue.

181
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,229
How do you remember
all this stuff?

182
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,567
Ah, it's easy.
Like it was
yesterday.

183
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,539
Speaking of
yesterday, Captain,

184
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,543
is this the table
that you
always sit at?

185
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,842
Because I'm getting
something here.

186
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,211
The murder?

187
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,646
The murder?

188
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:42,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you were sitting here
when you saw the victim.

189
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,319
Shawn, what are
you talking about?

190
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,326
Shut up, Henry.
I solved a new murder.

191
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,385
And your boy here's
the only one
who believes me.

192
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,487
Now, let the kid work!

193
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,192
(STAMMERING)
I'm seeing a man...

194
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,100
5'9", 5'10" tops.

195
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,636
Shaved head.

196
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,228
Yes! Yes!

197
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,467
Yes, yes...

198
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,907
His name...

199
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,876
(STAMMERING)
Mif... Mif-you...
No.

200
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,743
(STAMMERING)
May? Mick?

201
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,213
Mike!

202
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,910
His name is Mike!

203
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,413
He was arguing

204
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,284
over in the park

205
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:19,119
with that
bastard
Mort Crocker.

206
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,392
A mountain lion...

207
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,159
He pinned it
on a mountain lion!

208
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,136
Now, if I
can just
prove it...

209
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:35,833
All right, look,
why don't I play psychic
here for a moment?

210
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,240
It wasn't a young man.
It was a young woman.

211
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:42,213
She's pretty.
Brunette hair,
nice figure,

212
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,215
she liked to
play Scrabble
with her friends.

213
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,410
Her name was Zoe.

214
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,912
Yeah,

215
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,285
you're right.

216
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,054
That's who
was murdered.

217
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:57,760
They said it was
a mountain lion,
but they were wrong!

218
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,559
Dad, you're
amazing!

219
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,037
Maybe my
psychic gift
is hereditary.

220
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,437
Shawn, Zoe Sharp
is a young woman

221
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,172
who was found dead
20 years ago, mauled
by a mountain lion.

222
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,442
Connors and I
worked the case.

223
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,540
So, she was murdered?

224
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,519
She was in
the wrong place
at the wrong time.

225
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,350
A tragedy, yes.

226
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,616
A murder? No.

227
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,385
Not then,
and not now.

228
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,519
Okay, okay,
let's forget Zoe Sharp,
may she rest in peace.

229
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,257
But Connors still
saw the guy on
the "Missing" poster

230
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,458
arguing with
Mort Crocker
in the park.

231
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,625
What?

232
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:39,837
Shawn, we have no idea
what Connors saw
or what he didn't see.

233
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,964
The man is ill.
Early-onset
Alzheimer's.

234
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,441
His mind, the past,
the present,
it's all screwy.

235
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,343
It's all the same to him.
So, he sees Crocker
standing there in the park.

236
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,903
It triggers an old
memory of Zoe.

237
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,075
Next thing you know,
he's living
in the past.

238
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,915
Dad, this guy's your friend.
He came to me for help.

239
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,183
Shawn, leave him be.

240
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,693
He doesn't need your help
to make him look
like an old fool.

241
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,991
He deserves
better than that.

242
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,465
Shawn!

243
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,031
Run, little alien!
Run!

244
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,337
Shawn!

245
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,435
What?
You're gonna want
to see this.

246
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,446
See what?
Look!

247
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:24,738
Uh...

248
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,578
Coincidence?

249
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,415
I don't think so.

250
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,323
So, when my dad said
he solved a murder,

251
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,588
you think this is the guy
that was killed?

252
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:37,890
Well...

253
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,124
It seems like
a simple question,
doesn't it, Trish?

254
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,133
I'm afraid the
answer is a bit more
complicated.

255
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:46,570
You see, as a psychic,
it is important that I
elicit the proper...

256
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,671
(IMITATES WHIP)

257
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,515
I'm sorry. Raise your hand
if you want to know how
my amazing gift works!

258
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,379
Gus, you're so
much better at this.

259
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,079
Why don't you
tell Trish how
it works.

260
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,553
I've got some
stuff I need to do.

261
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,646
Sure.

262
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,716
The answer to your
question is yes, we do
believe that is the victim.

263
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,694
Please.
So, what's
the next step?

264
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,630
Well, being that
the authorities believe

265
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:14,996
he was killed
by a mountain lion,

266
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,557
Shawn is going to

267
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,330
attempt to elicit

268
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,895
a psychic link
with this suspect,

269
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,567
in order to establish
his guilt or innocence.

270
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,371
And by suspect,
you mean...

271
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,511
The mountain lion, yes.

272
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,844
Amazing.

273
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,113
Not really, it's... it's...
It's fairly common
for a psychic

274
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,918
to be able to read
different species
of the animal kingdom.

275
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,424
No, not that.

276
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,619
What?

277
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:45,095
The way that
he's sitting there
so quiet.

278
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,224
I mean, in high school
he was always so loud,

279
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,860
and needed
attention
constantly

280
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,494
and needed
to be noticed.

281
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,198
And he just
would not shut up!

282
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,605
He was so annoying.
He drove me nuts!

283
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,405
But now...

284
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,378
I mean,
look at him,
he's so...

285
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,109
Calm,
so unobtrusive.

286
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:07,812
And the way he let you
just step in and
take over like that.

287
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,082
I think he's
really matured.

288
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,454
Yeah, yeah, he has.

289
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,121
Dad!
No! No!

290
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,794
He was mauled
by a mountain lion.

291
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,595
You don't find that
the least bit
coincidental?

292
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,260
Of course it's
coincidental, Shawn.

293
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,701
But it doesn't
make it murder.

294
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:29,002
No, it makes it an episode of
<i>When Animals Attack:</i>
<i>Santa Barbara.</i>

295
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,066
Yes, well, mountain lions
do attack in
Santa Barbara.

296
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,577
In fact, you watch
the news, right?

297
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,546
That's your source
of psychic information?

298
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,603
It happens.

299
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,742
Connors came to me.
He says,
"I solved a murder."

300
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,287
Shawn, Connors
was a good cop.

301
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,719
And the thing
that made him
a good cop

302
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,848
is that he never
accepted the
easy answer.

303
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,325
But that doesn't
mean that he was
always right.

304
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,986
Obviously somewhere
in his mind,

305
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,826
he's confused something
that happened
20 years ago

306
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,957
with something
that's happened
today.

307
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:56,626
Okay, fine.

308
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,727
Talk to me
more about
20 years ago.

309
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,206
How does Zoe Sharp
connect to
Mort Crocker?

310
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,263
(SIGHING)

311
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,607
Mort Crocker founded
the Mort's family
restaurant chain.

312
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,976
He was the CEO.

313
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:12,950
At the time, Zoe Sharp
was his assistant, and
there was a rumor...

314
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,212
A rumor!

315
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,981
That they were
having an affair.

316
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,989
Nice, that's
good stuff!

317
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,285
And Connors
knew about it?

318
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,484
Of course he knew about it.

319
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,424
Every good cop makes it
his job to know about
things like that,

320
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,792
but there was
never any proof,
Shawn. No proof!

321
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,800
And even if there was,
somewhere in some
corner of his mind

322
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,359
there is a memory,
a lingering memory,

323
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,098
searching
for closure.

324
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:37,233
But then he sees
Mike here arguing
with Mort Crocker.

325
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,743
Connors is not the most
reliable witness, Shawn.

326
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,439
Dad, he's onto
something.

327
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,674
One mountain lion,
two mountain lions!

328
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,977
Mountain lions!
You're right.

329
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,654
You should talk to
a mountain lion.

330
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,659
(GROWLING)

331
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,865
Whoa!

332
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:11,839
(IMITATING JAMES EARL JONES)
Simba! I am your father.

333
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:13,842
I don't think
Mufasa said that.

334
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,711
Ah, Mufasa, Vader,
<i>I'm Not Rappaport,</i>

00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:17,806
it's all James Earl Jones.

337
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,511
It still works.

338
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,751
We're not even
supposed to be
in here.

339
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,817
Relax. I love cats,
and it's been proven
that cats love me.

340
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,421
Well, this cat
likes to eat people.

00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,361
Here,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

342
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,798
You're not going
to eat anybody...

No, no.
He's not
a man-eater.

380
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,126
No, no, if he attacked,
it's only because
he was malnourished.

So, tell us.
Why is the cat
so malnourished?

I really don't know.
I mean, we had record
rainfall this year.

There's an abundance
of foliage for his prey
to feed on.

384
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:29,005
He should be fat,
but he's underweight.

have any crackers
to go with it?

502
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,894

505
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,575
I suspect that
at one point,

506
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:40,550
our man-eating mountain lion
was kept in that cage,
and sustained a small cut.

and took him to the zoo.

00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,299
that we might be
eaten by some
kind of wild animal.

514
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,737
Does that sort
of thing ever
really happen?

515
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,833
Well, it's not unheard of.

516
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:09,174
Fact is, we had a guy
killed by a mountain lion
just a couple of days ago.

517
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,839
Does that
kind of thing
happen often?

518
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,613
Oh, a few times
in the past 50 years.

519
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,956
I thought mountain lions
were afraid of humans.

520
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,857
Generally, but if
they get hungry enough...

521
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,987
We've had a really
dry year, that means
reduced vegetation,

522
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:30,000
and reduced vegetation means
fewer deer and the like
for the lions to feed on.

523
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,470
You can't really
blame the cat.

524
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,301
It gets hungry
and it wants to eat.

525
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,942
You mind if I ask you
a question that's
completely unrelated?

526
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,104
Sure.

527
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,915
Is that real
mahogany?

528
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,146
Now, what
do we know?

529
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,621
We know there was
plenty of rain
this year,

530
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,021
no reason for a mountain
lion to be malnourished.

531
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,649
Why was
Ranger De Soto lying?

532
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:55,750
Why do people
usually lie?

533
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,953
He's hiding something.

534
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,728
Henry Spencer
back from lunch yet?

535
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,096
Henry Spencer?

536
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,430
I'm sorry,
who are you?

537
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,596
Never mind.

538
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,639
Just tell him
to come and find me.

539
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,198
We need to go over
that Zoe Sharp file again.

540
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,470
Whoa!
Excuse me, sir.

541
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,512
You can't go
back there!

542
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,511
What the hell
is all this?

543
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,681
Captain Connors?

544
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,083
Yeah.

545
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:32,224
May I help you?
This is my desk.

546
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:38,069
Look, son. I don't know
who the hell you are,
but you're confused.

547
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,764
This is my desk.
It's been my desk for years.

548
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,935
Now, you can either help me
find the Zoe Sharp file,
or take a hike.

549
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,739
You know what?

550
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,481
Maybe there's
someone we should call.

551
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,645
Hey, look, I don't have time
for all this crap.
I've got work to do!

552
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,914
Sir, please.
Don't make
this difficult.

553
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,320
Hey, you wanna
dance, pal?

554
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,188
You just name
that tune.
Come on!

555
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:02,917
I don't know,
Shawn.

556
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,552
Accusing Crocker
of murder's a
pretty big deal.

557
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,927
It doesn't bother you
that we're missing
things like motive,

558
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,262
where the murder
took place, or any kind
of evidence or proof?

559
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,926
News flash, Gus,
the cops think
I'm a psychic.

560
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,867
I just have to get
a feeling at
the right time.

561
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,736
Shawn! Gus!
What are you
doing here?

562
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,968
My father,
he's disappeared.

563
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,271
MAN:
Hey!

564
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,708
Come on.

565
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,072
Where?

566
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,236
(GRUNTS)

567
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:30,087
All right, now you are
starting to piss me off,
old man.

568
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,787
Come here!

569
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,049
It's time
for you to go.

570
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,723
Henry! Henry!

571
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,093
Tell them
who I am!

572
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,857
Um...
I think he's
talking to you.

573
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,002
Oh, God, please tell me
I don't look anything
like my father.

574
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,094
You could be his twin.

575
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,071
Look at the back
of my head. Is my hair
starting to thin at all?

576
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,197
Shawn!
Henry!

577
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,107
I think we all
know who this is.

578
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,904
This is
Captain
Brett Connors,

579
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,813
one of the
finest cops
in the SBPD,

580
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,214
someone I'd
be happy to share
a squad car with.

581
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,185
What the hell
is going on,
Spencer?

582
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,619
This man happens
to be my friend,
now let him go.

583
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:07,487
He's your
responsibility. Get
him out of here.

584
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,155
Let's go,
Captain.

585
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,891
I should report
them all to
Internal Affairs.

586
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,455
They should be
brought up
on charges.

587
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,832
I couldn't agree more.
You head home, I'll draw up
the paperwork.

588
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,113
That's
the girlfriend.

589
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,980
I'm sorry
to disturb you.

590
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,190
Was his
name Mike?

591
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,295
Yeah, it was.

592
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,024
How did you know?

593
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,698
Shawn Spencer,
police psychic.

594
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:54,771
I know that this
must be a very
tough time for you.

595
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,898
Sabrina.
Sabrina...

596
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,471
I am so sorry
for your loss.

597
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,646
You know, he'd
come all this way.

598
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:11,713
Lived so much, and his whole
life can be condensed
into a few items in this box.

599
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,553
Mike wasn't
from here, was he?

600
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,929
No, no, he was visiting.

601
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,833
Yeah, that's right.
We were both from
Pennsylvania.

602
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:28,168
Mike came out here
to search for his
birth parents.

603
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,971
I am sensing
a longing.

604
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,909
He was so sad
the first time
he called me.

605
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,776
He just found out
that his birth mother
had been dead

606
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,078
for almost
20 years.

607
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,051
And that would
explain the sadness
that I'm feeling.

608
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,486
But then a few days
later he called to say

609
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,354
that he thought
he had located
his birth father.

610
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,484
I'd never heard
him more excited.

611
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,655
Did Mike bring another
pair of shoes with him
on this trip?

612
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,961
No, no.
Just what he
had on him.

613
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,831
It was pretty sudden,
this trip out here.

614
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,062
I see.

615
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:04,502
Sabrina, I'm feeling
that Mike does not
want you to be sad.

616
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,037
Can you tell me,

617
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:11,207
did Mike get to meet
his birth father?

618
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:15,241
He said he was
a really wealthy man
and difficult to get to.

619
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,247
Yes.

620
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,755
Yes, he did.

621
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,466
A biotin deficiency
can be hereditary.

622
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,202
It's not exactly
a paternity test,

623
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,107
but let's see if
Crocker has the
same prescription.

624
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,668
If so, we know
Connors is right.

625
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,008
This is
a fortress.

626
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,139
We need a plan.

627
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,308
I don't think we can exactly
just ring the buzzer

628
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,215
and ask to peek
into Mr. Crocker's
medicine cabinet.

629
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,777
Why not?
That sounds perfectly
reasonable to me.

630
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,584
Why can't we be
from the state board

631
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,284
of medicine cabinet
inspectors?

632
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,587
I don't know, Shawn.

633
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,287
I know I'm right
on this one.

634
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,795
Let's think
this through.

635
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,865
No, Gus. Come on,
let's go in
without a plan,

636
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,696
flying by the
seat of our pants.

637
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,793
It'll be so much
more fun, trust me.

638
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,201
See, look, man.
There's some kind of
commotion happening here.

639
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,006
Planning a party.
It's a piece of cake.

640
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,512
They're never going
to notice us.

641
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,043
Excuse me,
where are
your badges?

642
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,086
Oh, I don't need
a badge, I'm the
event planner.

643
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,620
The event
planner's
a woman.

644
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,155
Yeah, I'm her
assistant.

645
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,383
Also a woman.

646
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,822
To the
assistant.

647
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,120
I'm calling
security.

648
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,321
No, no, no, no!
You don't need
to do that.

649
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,931
Don't tell me what
to do. The rules are
very strict here.

650
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,794
Really? You're going
to let your bosses
run you around like that?

651
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,670
You're gonna
let the man
hold you down?

652
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:42,933
These freak bastards
with their rules
and regulations?

653
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,634
You're a human person!

654
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,643
You need to rise up
and tell them all
to go to hell.

655
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:49,271
We can all
do it together!
Let us empower you.

656
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,940
I'm Edna Crocker,

657
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,816
and you are one minute
away from a
squad car ride.

658
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,287
Probably ought
to let this one go.
Yeah.

659
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,057
Hi.

660
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,187
Hi.

661
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,700
I'm here to pick up
a prescription
for a Mr. Crocker,

662
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:11,757
Mort Crocker.

663
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,269
One moment, please.

664
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,327
Thank you.

665
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,807
See, you should
listen to me
every once in a while.

666
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,174
That's not fair.

667
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,679
I don't have access
to medical files
and doctor's names.

668
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,544
Shawn, I called
two pharmacies,

669
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,516
while you were
being interrogated.

670
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,018
I don't have anything
for Mr. Crocker.

671
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:30,943
(SNIFFING)

672
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,418
Are you sure
about that?

673
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,550
Yes.

674
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,991
Um...

675
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,823
Can I just
get back there
for a second?

676
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,763
I'm sorry,
we don't
have anything,

677
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:45,428
and someone has already
picked up all of his most
recent prescriptions.

678
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,198
Is it that bastard,
Jimmy Derukie?

679
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,137
Shawn, please.

680
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:53,041
I'll tell you what,
before I go
a little nuts,

681
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,443
why don't you just
give me the name

682
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,003
of the prescriptions
and we can get
out of here.

683
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,208
Okay, okay, see,
it's a long-standing
prescription.

684
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,775
It needs to be renewed.
No one's gonna
go nuts here.

685
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,218
(CLEARING THROAT)

686
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:06,780
(STAMMERING)
Okay, no, I do
have something,

687
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,520
but they picked
that up over
two months ago.

688
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,618
Really?

689
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,060
What was that?
The penicillin?

690
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,894
No, it was his
regular dosage of
something called...

691
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:15,990
Biotin.

692
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,035
Yes, is that what
you're looking for?

693
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,468
Yes. Thank you.

694
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,334
All right, Spencer.

695
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,777
You said you found
an eyewitness for
Mike McMillan's murder.

696
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,140
Where is he?

697
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,108
Okay, Mike.
Go ahead.

698
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,347
Tell the detectives
exactly what
you told me.

699
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,455
You're kidding
me, right?

700
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,826
And we're
out of here.

701
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,422
Mike says he was in town
searching for his
natural birth parents.

702
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:49,898
If you don't believe him,
you can ask his girlfriend.

703
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,230
That's true.
She told me.

704
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,532
Did she also tell you
that he found
his birth father?

705
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,970
Well, what about his
birth mother? Did Mike
say if he found her?

706
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,065
No, no.
He didn't
say anything.

707
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,200
See, he can't.

708
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,269
He's a picture on a piece
of paper, and dead.

709
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,478
You should be
ashamed
of yourself.

710
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,416
Mike said his mother
was killed 20 years ago,

711
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,749
right after
he was born.

712
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,847
Her name was Zoe Sharp.

713
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,623
I knew it.

714
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,524
That son of a bitch.

715
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,927
He killed her and now
he got rid of the baby!

716
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,091
He protects his business,
his reputation,

717
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,565
and he doesn't have
to share his wealth.

718
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:24,999
Sounds like a motive
for murder to me.

719
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,297
Really?
Yep.

720
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,396
Then how do
you explain the
mountain lions?

721
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,873
Huh? You're so smart?
How do you explain that?

722
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,234
Lassi, why are you
asking him?

723
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,542
He was just a baby
when his mother
was killed.

724
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,445
In fact, he wasn't
even there.

725
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,280
Summer of '86
was hot and dry.

726
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,946
There were
a lot of fires.

727
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,614
Lions were all
going hungry.

728
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,887
I remember some of them
came right into town
looking for food.

729
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:55,862
Crocker killed Zoe
and dumped her body
in the hills.

730
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,560
He didn't know
about the lions,
that just happened!

731
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,571
They ate the evidence
and covered his tracks!

732
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,601
He just got lucky!

733
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,198
What about
this time?

734
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,743
With Michael,
he just got
lucky again?

735
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,712
No, not this time.
This time he had help.

736
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,214
Ranger De Soup...
(QUIETLY)
De Soto!

737
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,874
De Soto
provided
the lion.

738
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,009
De Soto?
I know that name.

739
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,815
I just can't
remember why.

740
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,912
Sir, it's okay.

741
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,116
Well, I got to
hand it to
you, Spencer.

742
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,749
This is a
terrific story.

743
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,191
There's just
one problem.

744
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,422
Sir, it's nothing
that Mike can't help
us work through.

745
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,691
What is it?
Crocker has
an airtight alibi.

746
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,289
He was in Chicago
when Mike was killed.

747
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,664
Oh, he's lying.

748
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,566
No, I checked
it out myself, sir.

749
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,197
He spoke at
a symposium in front
of 200 other people.

750
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,331
No, no.

751
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,738
Not again.
Not this time.

752
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:38,935
Hey, Dad!

753
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:39,999
Sir!

754
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,443
Daddy?

755
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,207
He wouldn't do
anything stupid,
would he?

756
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,771
Define "stupid."

757
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,372
Go up to
Crocker himself?

758
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,614
Trish, come on!

759
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,395
MAN: Children, no running!

760
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,066
Jane!
So nice to see you.
You, too.

761
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,007
How do
you do?

762
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:14,442
Mort Crocker,
you're under arrest

763
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,242
for the murder
of Zoe Sharp and
Mike McMillan.

764
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,148
Mr. Connors,
I'm so glad
you could make it.

765
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,345
Why don't you help
yourself to a drink?

766
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,853
No, no, no, no.

767
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:26,981
You might fool
all of these people,
but not me.

768
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,349
Is everything
all right,
darling?

769
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,520
Everything's fine.
Please go
back to...

770
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,064
Captain Connors, sir,
why don't you let us
take you home?

771
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,827
Pardon us for
the disturbance.

772
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,333
Oh, crap!

773
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,394
Hey!

774
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,021
Connors!

775
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,999
Oh, come on!
Stop acting
like a child!

776
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,164
Dad?

777
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,342
Bless you.

778
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,069
Thank you.

779
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:34,719
Shh!

780
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,029
He was here.

781
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,505
Well, of course
he's here. We saw him
come in, Sherlock.

782
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,303
No, no.
Not Connors.
Mike.

783
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,935
Mike McMillan
was here.

784
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,001
What?

785
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,809
But you sound
all muffled.

786
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,248
What are you
eating something?

787
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,649
How can...

788
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,981
Right, right, right.

789
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,783
My bad.
My bad.

790
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,417
He was muffled.
It was my fault.

791
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:11,825
There. There,
that's so much better.

792
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,659
Please get
out of here now.

793
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,926
I don't allow
anyone inside
my greenhouse.

794
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,525
Well, that's
not exactly true,
now, is it?

795
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:22,061
You let
Mike McMillan
in, didn't you?

796
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,437
I mean, this is
where you killed him.

797
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,671
You see, when Mike's spirit
started talking about Crocker,

798
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,408
I thought he meant
Mr. Crocker,
but it wasn't.

799
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:34,918
He was talking about
Mrs. Crocker.

800
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:38,285
Well, for your sake,
you had better be
right this time.

801
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:43,054
He came
to see you, but
you weren't here.

802
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,490
What?

803
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,259
Mike, you know
I don't speak
Italian.

804
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,162
Shoes. He wants you
to check the shoes

805
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,329
that he was wearing
that day. The soles.

806
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:58,307
You'll find potting soil
in the tread that matches
that stuff.

807
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,105
Edna,
what's he
talking about?

808
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,236
Edna?
God damn it!

809
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,407
That's why
I know
the name.

810
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:09,744
Before you
were married, your name
was Edna De Soto!

811
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,689
And you and your brother
John, the park ranger, were
in this together.

812
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,989
He used the lion
to cover your tracks.

813
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:21,122
You're not really going
to believe this old fool,
are you?

814
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,927
Watch who
you're calling...
What?

815
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,299
I'm sorry, that was my fault,
I just wasn't paying
attention to you.

816
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,668
Are you serious?
It's in a
bird feeder?

817
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,001
No, I'll say it.

818
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,099
There's a surveillance
camera out front.

819
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,970
Apparently
it's in a bird feeder.

820
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,445
If the tape wasn't erased,

821
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:41,213
you'll be able to see him
arriving on the day
he was killed.

822
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:46,350
Please, Edna,
tell me
you didn't.

823
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,257
What was I
supposed to do?

824
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,993
Someone had to protect
everything we've worked
so hard for!

825
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,797
You would have
given him half
of everything!

826
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,099
Just like you would
have his mother.

827
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,833
He was my son!

828
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:10,605
Detective,
arrest this woman,

829
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,410
and while
you're at it,

830
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:15,509
issue a warrant
for the arrest
of John De Soto,

831
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,749
for the murder
of Zoe Sharp and
Mike McMillan.

832
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,791
Officers,
you heard
the captain.

833
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,348
Get them
out of here.

834
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,501
Dad, I'm so
proud of you.

835
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,277
Showoff.

836
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,608
Good for you.

837
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,414
Yeah, thanks.

838
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,352
It's a real honor,
you know.

839
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,982
I thought these days
were long gone.

840
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,423
Does that mean
you're coming out
of retirement?

841
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,722
What, are you kidding?

842
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,786
I'm lucky if
I come out
of the fog.

843
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,094
Well, you gotta keep
your brain stimulated.

844
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,758
Try the crosswords.

845
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,132
Nah, I like that
Sudoku.

846
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,632
Well, we could always
go after cold cases.

847
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:14,144
Nah, best leave it
to the young guys, huh?

848
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,346
Thanks for giving
him this day.

849
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,751
I hope he remembers
it tomorrow.

850
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:27,814
He couldn't
let go and move on,
you know?

851
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,819
Shawn?
Yeah? What?

852
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,062
I'm sorry, I...

853
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,632
A little... Little lump
in my throat.

854
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,301
Speaking of lumps...
Yes?

855
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,499
The ostrich?
The tennis ball?

856
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,302
What?

857
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,674
You know what?
It's not a big deal,
obviously.

858
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,680
But it always
bugged me a little.

859
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,443
Why didn't you
say anything, Trish?

860
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:53,574
Like what?

861
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,640
Oh, I don't know.

862
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,380
"I threw the tennis ball
into the highly restricted
ostrich area,

863
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,355
"and I let you
take the fall
for it."

864
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,981
You're serious.

865
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,923
It's not too late
to make it right.

866
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:04,955
Right is right.

867
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:10,027
You really still
have not grown up,
have you?

868
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:13,363
Wow.
Goodbye, Shawn.

869
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,696
Gus.

870
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,235
(CHUCKLING)
What?

871
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:21,973
Hey! There she is!
Hey!

872
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,705
No, no, here.

873
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,982
There, are
you happy?

874
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,042
Yeah, actually,
I am.

875
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,780
Good.

876
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,186
Good?

877
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,716
You really want me to believe
that you put your foot
in your mouth deliberately?

878
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,055
Please.

879
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,387
Go get the girl.

880
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,658
It's your move.
No.

881
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,666
Listen, would you go...
Shawn, I told you.

882
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,998
I do not need you
to lay back for me
to get a girl.

883
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,737
Get over there.
No.

884
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,834
Show her the abs.

885
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,873
Show her the abs.

886
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,002
Not until you challenge me
straight up!

887
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,438
Fine.

888
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,341
I will be
kissing Trish

889
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:02,883
in 10 minutes.

890
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,716
Not if I get
there first.

891
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,599
<i>In between the lines</i>
<i>there's a lot of obscurity</i>

892
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:21,263
<i>I'm not inclined</i>
<i>to resign to maturity</i>

893
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:24,671
<i>If it's all right</i>
<i>then you're all wrong</i>

894
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,007
<i>But why bounce around</i>
<i>to the same damn song</i>

895
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,613
<i>You'd rather run</i>
<i>when you can't crawl</i>

896
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,817
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>That I'm not telling the truth</i>

897
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,222
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>They just don't have any proof</i>

898
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,262
<i>Embrace the deception</i>
<i>Learn how to bend</i>

899
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:49,459
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend</i>
<i>to psych you out in the end</i>

900
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,192
<i>I know, you know</i>

901
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,732
<i>I know, you know</i>
