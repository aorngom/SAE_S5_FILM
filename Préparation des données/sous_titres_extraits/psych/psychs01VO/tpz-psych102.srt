weirdo compulsives

the same restaurant,
sit in the same chair,

5

every day?

sitting right there
three minutes ago,

7

I made a crawling snake
with the straw wrapper.

already talked
more than I wanted to.

out the window while
you two talk?

like hockey with words.

the greatest
spell champion ever.

all by himself in

He can't just sit
in the crowd!

Oh, come on, dude,

181
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,262
Do you know how to spell
any of these words?

182
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,274
Proudly. I have never
heard of any of
these words.

183
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,173
I file these words under
"Things to say

"when I want to be ridiculed
or kicked out of bed."

185

that butyraceous is
clearly a Round One word.

we still have things
in common, Gus!

188
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,285
Well, instead of
sitting here, maybe
we should get to work!

189

190
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,554
Wow!

191
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,560

it looks like.

194

This is where you go to
deal with missing a word.

195
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,965
Oh, yeah? Where do they
take you to deal with

196
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,907
missing your entire
childhood?

197
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,743
Shawn, this misplaced
malevolence you have
with the spelling bee

198
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,679
is getting monotonous.

199
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,050
Stop hating on the bee!

200
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,520
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I do apologize for his
inappropriate virulence.

201
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,750
Why are you using
all these big-ass
words all of a sudden?

202
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,553
I'm not doing that.

203
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,591
That's preposterous!

204
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,898
I was in the spelling bee
myself.

205
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:00,955
I almost won.

206
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,022

still on that?

207
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,535
Of course I'm still on it!
I know it wasn't "O"!

208
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,869
You may have five
minutes with each
contestant, no more.

209
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,999
If the room is needed,
you'll be asked to vacate.

210
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,340
I'll begin with the
eliminated contestants.

211

Actually, we'd only like
to speak with the ones

with the shifty-eyed ones,
shall we?

the whole time?

to come this far.

You watch him win.

Yes! For the road!
In case later on
I get hungry enough

339

to eat something
that might be poisoned!

and two on the other side.

At this point, all indications
are Mr. Cavanaugh was
having a heart attack,

352
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,920
stumbled forward,
falling over the railing
to his death.

is both safe and...

Our sympathies go out
to Mr. Cavanaugh's family,

356

stop investigating!

and then I really have
to go wrap up this thing.

364
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,181

what Cavanaugh's big
announcement was?

all that out loud?

what that is without a lab.

370

I'll get a lab.

Right now?

372
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:53,995
Maybe.

Where you going?

507
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:03,392
I am going to build
a doghouse!

508
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,938
I thought you gave up.

509
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,771
Yeah, well, it doesn't
appear so, huh?

510
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,203
What happened to your leg?

511
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,011
Absolutely nothing.

512
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,220
You're running your roofing
vertical there, huh?

513
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,276
Yeah.

514
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,353
You might wanna pop
a ridge beam in first.

515
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,723
Well, yeah, that's a given.

516
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,239
What the hell
are you doing?

517
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,970
I'm gonna help you.

518
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,570
You've never helped me
before, ever.

519
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,239
You've never asked.

520
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,040
Put a nail in here.

521
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,150
All right. This is weird.

522
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,759
No, thanks.

523
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,335
Not bad.

It's like the Park Hyatt
for poodles.

527
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,007
Will you call Jack Syklan?

528
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,920
What is this?
Your results.

529
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,784
We had an agreement.

530
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,914
This is a derivative
of methyl parathion.
High-grade stuff.

531
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,825
Whatever you're into,
I want you to get out quick.

532
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,556
I'm not kidding.

533
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,328
Wait a sec. How did you
get this so quickly?

534
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,201
Hmm? Oh, Syklan's a part
of my poker game.

535
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,237
So you didn't even
have to call him?

536
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,402
That game was at his house.

537
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,606
And I did all of that
for nothing?

538
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,349
For nothing? Shawn,
you've never completed
a thing in your life.

539
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,654
Now you have.

540
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:15,958
Poisoned?

541
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,502
I feel somebody
poisoned his food.

542
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,060
There is a

543
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,772

(IMITATES CRACKING)
A fortune cookie!

547
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,579
This is ridiculous.
Is it?

548
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:38,714
Mr. Spencer, what we have now
points to a medical condition,
not murder.

549
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,884
All appearances show
Mr. Cavanaugh having
an anaphylactic reaction.

550
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,919
Not to be out of line,
but that could be triggered
by several types of poisons.

551
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,123
Or altered medications.

552
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,893
Or shellfish, which
he was allergic to.

553
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,868
Those results will show up
in the toxicology report,

554
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,961
which we will have a copy of
in approximately two weeks.

555
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,563
No, no, no!
That'll be too late.

556
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,631
All the contestants
will be gone...

557
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,269
Home.

558
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,046
You won't be able to finish
a real investigation.

559
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,709
Chief, I sense this!

560
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,311
Look, something
got out of control

561
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,877
and the perpetrator
was willing to kill
to cover it up!

562
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,855
What proof do you have?

563
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,225
Only what I feel.

564
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,266
Why are you still
listening to this crap?

565
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,597
Dude, what is your glitch?

566
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,638
You! You're my glitch!

567
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,606
Look, he got nowhere
with his little inhaler
assignment,

568
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,972
and then he tells the media
that we had a murder scene!

569
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,840
Cut him loose, Karen!

570
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,679
I mean, do whatever you
think is best, Chief.

571
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,619
Mr. Cavanaugh was gonna
make an announcement.
What about that?

572
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,453
The Director said
he'd recently spoken
of retiring.

573
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,685
That's not what
he was gonna say.

574
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,057
Oh, you know?

575
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,152
I know.

576
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,687
Mr. Spencer, I asked you
to check in about
the inhaler incident.

577
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,165
If you or your partner
have anything about that,

578
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,202
I'd be happy
to hear about it.

579
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,497
Otherwise...

580
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,436
We gotta get back into
the spellmaster's room.

581
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,913
Are you serious?
Gus, the killer was there!

582
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,849
There's gotta be
some other piece
of evidence inside.

583
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,653
We're not gonna have
time to get in there.

584
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:17,915
Besides, it's locked.

585
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,320
We'll make it work.

586
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,590
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

587
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,055
How hard is it to
get into this event
without a ticket?

588
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,528
Impossible.

589
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,262
The new spellmaster.
Check it out.

590
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,659
It's exactly what
I was hoping you'd say.

591
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,433
You can't do
that to him!

592
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:41,070
Gus, he has to learn
sometime that smoking
is bad for him.

593
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,940
We're picking it up
as a new round commences.

594
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,450
A lot of excitement
in the air.
Ooh, yeah.

595
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,680

butyraceous, Bud.

heard that.

It doesn't mean anything,

Give me a word!
A word?

617
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,289
Yeah! Something hard,
but something you can spell.

618
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,162
I can spell anything.

be spellmaster!
