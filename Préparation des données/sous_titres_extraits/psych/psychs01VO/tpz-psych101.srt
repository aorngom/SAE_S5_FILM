11
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:54,811

12

It's the stuff
these seats are covered in.

13

14

15
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,124

She's wearing a name tag,

of cake? How many hats
are in the room?

22
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,438

24
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:26,710
Three.

00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,717
That's not fair.
Time's almost up, Shawn.

27
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,921
One has a flower,
the one the lady's wearing.

28
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,257
One has a picture
of some kind of lion,

29
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,422
on the weird guy
with the crooked tooth.

30

What about the beanie?

32
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,928
A beanie's a cap, not a hat.

All right, open your eyes.
Thank you!

reason, Mr. Spencer.
That's all we need.

175
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,418
How did you get
this information?

176
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,327
No, it is too
late for that.

177
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,366
Officer Allen, book him.

178
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,195
Book him?

179
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,164
Oh, come on, cuffs?
What? For the walk back
to the lobby?

180
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:02,173
Or, you could give us
a plausible explanation.

181
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:11,478
Okay, okay. Fine, you win.

182
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,081
I got the information because

183
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,923
I'm psychic.

184
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,117
Get him out of here.

185
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,420
Oh, boy.

186
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,930
Your grandma
would be so proud.

187
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,135
You spoke to her?
I did.

188
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,534
She's safe, comfortable.

189
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:39,203
She wants you to stop
spending all your money
on those charlatans.

190
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,336
The palm readers?

191
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,471
The palm readers.

192
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:46,211
Okay, just to be clear,
you're claiming to be
a psychic, Mr. Spencer.

193
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,411
(EXCLAIMS)

194
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,856
How else would I know
that you two are
sleeping together?

195
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:59,824
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three. One...

196
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,894
When's the wedding?
May 3rd.

197
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,538
Wait, how'd you know?

198
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,803
I'm getting dance lessons
for a wedding reception.

199
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,076
And you are getting good.

200
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,037
Wow, that's amazing.

201
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,412
Oh, come on.
Who's buying this?

202
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,683
I got it.

203
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,690
Go to detention
room number two,
shake down your vandal.

204
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,386
You'll find all the
evidence you need.

205
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,898
All the evidence
is in his left shoe.

206
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,343
We'll be back here
in three minutes.

207
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,675
With my own cuffs!

208
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,008
(SIGHS)

209
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,410
Whoa!

210
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,191
I'm getting...
I am getting

211
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,053
the letter "L."

212
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,597
Lulu! Her dog!

213
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,630
Is there anything else
she said?

214
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,362
There's suddenly a very,
very negative presence here.

215
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,500
It's blocking me.

216
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,943
That was a lucky guess.
A lucky guess?

217
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,637
He planted it.
I don't know.

218
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,339
His alibi checks.

219
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,982
Question. Do I pay taxes
on reward money?

220
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:29,147
I'll find out. Please,
feel free to call anytime.

221
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,712
You know I will.
Magic touch!

222
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,536
Doctor?
Hey, yeah.

223
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,068
Not so fast, Mr. Spencer.

224
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,276
Karen Vick,
Interim Police Chief.

225
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,573
I know.

226
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,705
Heard about what
you did in there.

227
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:56,805
Oh, you're welcome.

228
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,577
That wasn't the phrase
I was going to use.

229
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,915
I was going to say,
improbable.

230
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,420
Possible, yet unlikely.

231
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,847
Look, it's hard to explain.

232
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,018
I'm gifted.
I was born that way.

233
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:12,653
I knew your father,
he was a good cop.
You're nothing like him.

234
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,131
I take that as a compliment,
ma'am.

235
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,191
Don't ever call me "ma'am."

236
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,795
Am I still free to go?

237
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,270
Not exactly.

238
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,632
You familiar with
the McCallum family?

239
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,970
McCallum?

240
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,009
Yeah, they own half the hill.

241
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,602
Well, there's been
a kidnapping.

242
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,444
Oh, come on.
I had nothing
to do with that.

243
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,177
Would you like to?

244
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,852
The feds are itching
to jump in on this case,

245
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,320
and I need to make
some progress.

246
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:41,018
What I need is a miracle,
or a facsimile of one.

247
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:48,096
Oh. I see, I see.
Well, I make $1,200 a day.

248
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,293
It's a tryout.

249
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:53,202
That's what I meant to say.
This is pro bono,
something for you.

250
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,299
And if this psychic thing
is a scam, we will prosecute.

251
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,404
You know hindering
a police investigation
is a criminal offense?

252
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,717
Sounds good!

253
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,450
We're on the same team now!
Kidnappers beware!

254
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,548
(CHUCKLES)

255
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,700
I have a job for you.

256
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,574
I already have a job.

257
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,245
They're paying you
to play video games?

258
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,338
How do you do that?

259
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,849
Come on, left hand, space bar,
right hand, arrow keys?

260
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,682
Gus, you should ask me
a challenging question
every once in a while,

261
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,982
just for kicks.

262
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,750
I can't go anywhere.
I'm behind on my route.

263
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,553
I've got new samples
of serum moxacillin.

264
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,584
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize the new
butt cream had come in.

265
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,722
So, you're not interested
in hearing about
doing the thing

266
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,528
we've been dreaming of doing
since we were eight?

267
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,571
I've got us the last job
we will ever need.

268
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:00,627
(CHORTLES)

269
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,197
Shawn, you've had 57 jobs
since we left high school.

270
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:07,075
Yes, I have. And
they were all fun,
but this one takes the cake.

271
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,376
Oh, yeah? Better than
your acupuncture clinic?

272
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,382
I didn't realize
experience was necessary.

273
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,283
What about the summer
you spent driving
the wiener mobile?

274
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,287
I did that for the hot dogs.

275
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,654
Look, Gus, all those jobs
I took because I wanted
the experience.

276
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,590
But then I mastered it
and I moved on.

277
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,561
But this job has
a little bit of everything.

278
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,328
Come with me.
No.

279
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,033
I'm never doing anything
blindly with you again.

280
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,037
I learned that at the
Mexican border, twice.

281
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,908
Okay, this is hard to explain,
but I'm going to
give it a shot.

282
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,500
You and I

283
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,579
are opening our own
private detective agency.

284
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,417
Oh. See?

285
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,219
No explanation necessary.

286
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,018
Let me get my coat.

287
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,591
But you're not
getting your coat.

288
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,526
No, no, Shawn, I'm not.

289
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,694
All right, you want to
sweat the details? Fine.

290
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:03,496
The cops think I'm a psychic
and now we are investigating
a kidnapping.

291
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,730
You're serious?
Yes, I am serious!

292
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,772
Six days ago,
Camden McCallum, Jr.,

293
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,831
sole male heir to
McCallum Textiles,

294
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,709
was seen being forced
into his Range Rover at
the municipal dog park.

295
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,179
No one has seen him
or the dog since.

296
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,715
They took the dog?

297
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,308
You see what I mean?
I need you!

298
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,979
I need you to
write stuff down.

299
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,819
'Cause you know how I zone out
when other people talk.

300
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,917
Just for today?
Just today.

301
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,791
Oh, and you know what?
You should bring
your sample case,

302
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,297
because some of those
forensics guys probably...

303
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,457
Whoa!

304
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,261
There's gonna be
forensics guys there?

305
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,065
SHAWN: All right,
pay attention.

306
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,300
Eighteen months ago,
Camden McCallum

307
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,707
ran his father's
Cigarette boat into
the Morrow Bay aquarium.

308
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,871
That was right after
he got caught with that
hockey player's wife.

309
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,971
Yeah, I remember that.

310
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,948
The guy hadn't been out
of the paper in five years.

311
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,450
Since that day, nothing.
Not a single news story.

312
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,578
Not so much as
a dented motorcycle.

313
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,781
Okay. What do you think?

314
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,751
I think Camden McCallum
is too good at what he does
to stop.

315
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:04,125
Not cold turkey, anyway.
Beautiful women, fast cars.

316
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,457
It doesn't add up.
Something happened.

317
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,499
How should we
introduce ourselves?

318
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,904
And don't say psychic,
they'll shut you off.

319
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,967
Say something vague,
like Alternative Tactics
Division.

320
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:22,241
How about the Bureau of
Magic and Spell-casting?

321
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,610
Where you going?

322
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,360
You're rooting
through the trash?
Just for a second.

323
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,124
You are, without doubt,
the worst detective
I've ever seen.

324
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,132
Gus, everything you need
is right in front of you.

325
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,861
You just have to
pay attention.

326
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,197
Oh, yeah?

327
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,194
Look at this.

328
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:49,972
Berenson's brand.

329
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,442
That is the highest quality
dog food on the market.

330
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,480
Perfect.
They pamper their pets.
The case is almost solved.

331
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,845
This stuff is really
expensive.

332
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,581
No additives,
no preservatives.

333
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,281
Why would you possibly open
three bags simultaneously,
when you only have one dog?

334
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,587
They're rich,
they waste money.

335
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,086
Oh, my God!

336
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,254
What?

337
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,632
This CD case is totally nice.

338
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,758
Why would someone
throw this out?

339
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,699
Here, put this in the car.

340
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,568
Inside, now.

341
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,672
Is it entirely too early
for me to have a theory?

342
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,334
Can you at least
wait until we see
some evidence?

343
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,003
I suppose I could
if it'd make you happier.

on one thing.

The only way they can
absolutely prove that
I am not a psychic,

unfortunate perm,

363
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,807

amazing girl.

she's a late bloomer,
but what does that mean?

have him looking further
to the left?

further to the left?

the talking.

519
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,041
Morning, gentlemen.

520
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,640
Hello, Officer.

521
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:03,886
What's this?

522
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:05,683
Oops!

523
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,852
That's my dad's old
police business card,

524
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,622
must've stuck
at the back there.

525
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,720
I guess I've been carrying
that in my wallet for ages.

526
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,856
Can never be too careful,
coming from a
family of cops.

527
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,525
Henry Spencer's your dad?

528
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:17,693
Yes, yes, he is.

529
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,963
Well, how's old Henry doing?

530

he's great.

532
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,045
I saw Henry three weeks ago
at the Home Depot.

533
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,082
Yeah, yeah,
that sounds about right.

534
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,277
He popped into town
for a few days,

535
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,842
grabbed some supplies,
some wood.

536
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,784
He said he'd been back
for over a year.

537
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,054
And now, he's back.

538
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,820

doing his thing,
Henry-style.

539
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,233
Tell your dad
"the kingfisher" says hello.

540
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,431
Will do.
Thank you, Officer.

541
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,534
Your dad's back
at the house?

542
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,076

tell me why we're here?

548
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,755
This is the Orso
family cabin,

549
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:23,631
where young Malcolm
and young Camden spent
all their summers growing up.

550
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,465
Wouldn't the police
have checked this out?

551
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,005
Malcolm is so far out
on the periphery
of Camden's life.

552
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:31,634
He's not on the witness list,
he's not on anybody's list.

553
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,274
This is a great plan.

554
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,404
Camden McCallum
deserves to be commended.

555
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,344
Maybe you should
date him, too.

556
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,714
Maybe I will.

Then later,
at headquarters,

569
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,544
I suddenly and miraculously
have a vision.

570
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,641
A vision?
A vision of stuff we saw!

571
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:16,482
Like the road sign
with the two bullet holes.

572
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,421
Like the red kayak,
the yellow kayak,
and the highway.

573
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,924
With numbers?
Oh, I'm seeing...

574
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,017
What am I seeing?
Eight, three, one...

We're on Highway 138.

things get jumbled
and out of sequence.

becomes clearer

578
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,301

the squad car together.

And, alas,
we'd lead them here.

582
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,043
And finally, we both put on
our surprised faces

583
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,205
as I guide them to the cabin
for the first time.

584

surprise at all!

do the talking.

00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:03,990

of witnesses for
my miraculous vision.

important, I call it lunch.

00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,509
I understand, I do.

685
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:49,103
You'd like to shut the book
on this as quickly as
possible. That's fine.

686
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,506
They had a falling-out.

687
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,017
Before they got
the ransom money? Why?

688
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,213
What did they
have to fight about
before they got the cash?

689
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,518
Might I remind you,
Mr. Spencer,
you are not a detective.

690
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,320
I just need to speak
to the witnesses again.

691
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:05,954
The McCallum family
has been through enough,
and this conversation is over.

692
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,091
Thank you. We parked in
the parking structure,
do you validate?

693
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,533
Would it make any difference
if I told you

694
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,934
Camden McCallum, Jr.
Spoke to me?

695
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,874
From beyond the grave.

696
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,971
Shut the door
on your way out.

697
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,574
Damn it.

698
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,650
What are you doing?
That was the Chief of Police.

699
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,153
Interim Chief.

700
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,520
And have you considered
that Camden McCallum
may have been alive

701
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:34,990
the first time
we went to that cabin?

702
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,458
No.
Well, I have!

703
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,558
I need to talk to that guy.
Whoa, whoa, no!

704
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,125
Come on, Gus,
just for a second.

705
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,069
The man is practically
almost my father-in-law.

706
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,869
Make no mistake, Shawn,
I will kill you.

707
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:55,769
Okay, I appreciate the fact
that you think you can beat
me up.

708
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:58,610
But I think our last scuffle
proves otherwise.

709
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,150
Are you talking about
the Cinnamon Festival?

710
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,583
Yes! You do remember!

711
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:04,678
Okay, first of all,
I was six,
and I had a cast!

712
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,916
Which many would construe
as a clear advantage.

713
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,983
It's like having a weapon
attached to your arm.

714
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,155
Oh, great, now the Chief
is staring right at us.

715
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,696
SHAWN: Mr. McCallum?
Chief wants him left alone.

716
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:17,927
Well, we all want
to be left alone.

717
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,765
Yeah, some more than others.

718
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:20,929
What's with his wrist?

719
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,097
You don't give up, do you?

720
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:26,007
I do give up, all the time.
But not until
the moment is right.

721
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:30,171
Now, come on,
I know you don't think
this adds up, either.

722
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,851
Okay, rumor is,
he tried to off himself.

723
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,646
Off himself.

724
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,750
The war hero?
The man who's
seen everything?

725
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,556
No, that's not it.
That's definitely not it.

726
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,028
You know everything,
don't you?

727
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,497
Yeah.
It's scary, isn't it?

728
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:52,502
Look, something is going on,
and I'm gonna find out what
it is.

729
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,198
No, you're not
going anywhere
near that man.

730
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,207
In fact, I'm gonna
make certain

731
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,435
you never hear from
the department again.

732
00:37:58,509 --> 00:37:59,703
Whoa!

733
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,578
I'm getting strong vibrations
that you might be wrong.

734
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,705
I'm onto you.

735
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,249
You've got a
source somewhere,
and I'm gonna find it.

736
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,648
You think this is
some sort of game?

737
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:08,980
I'm not gonna let you
just waltz around here

738
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,918
like some kid
in a candy store.

739
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,513
Let me be honest with you,
Detective.

740
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:17,083
I used to work
in a candy store,
and it's nothing like this.

741
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,000
You're in over your head,
mystic.

742
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,083
(DOORBELL RINGS)

743
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,518
Hi, Dad.

744
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:48,885
Shawn.

745
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,693
You didn't tell me
you moved back.

746
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,162
You didn't tell me
you moved away.

747
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,062
That was different.
Was it?

748
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,731
Yeah, I was busy trying
to help my mom through
her divorce.

749
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,329
Well, it's nice to
see you, too, son.

750
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,239
Can I come in?

751
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,835
No.

752
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,243
I was on my way
out to lunch.

753
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:15,513
You can come with me
if you don't bring this thing.

754
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,390
When I was in the department,
there were two things
I hated in this world.

755
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,988
Private investigators,
and psychics.

756
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,228
Congratulations, kid.

757
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,166
You just hit the
disappointment exacta.

758
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:33,430
Thank you,
thank you very much.

759
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:34,869
It sort of happened
by accident.

760
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,567
What are you gonna do
when you get caught?
Move out of town?

761
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,006
I'm not gonna get caught.

762
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,566
Shawn, this is just like
everything else.

763
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,908
Three months from now,
you're gonna be on a bus
going to Minneapolis

764
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,948
'cause you found your calling
as a weatherman.

765
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,575
It's not like that this time.
Have you been listening to me?

766
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:50,711
I've finally figured out
a way to use
my special gift.

767
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:54,087
You should be thrilled!
You're the one that
made me this way.

768
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,460
I'm good at this.

769
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,489
Oh, I see,
you're so good at it,

770
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,657
what are you doing
knocking at my door?

771
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,399
You think I came
to you for help.

772
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,064
Okay.

773
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,033
There was no ransom drop.

774
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:17,674
I'm not gonna be
a part of this.

775
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,807
Come on, would you
just hear me out?

776
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:21,911
(SIGHS)

777
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,779
Okay, no ransom drop,
so what? Big deal.

778
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:27,187
So, six days, nothing?
Not even a demand?

779
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,556
It happens all the time.
That's not unprecedented.

780
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,094
They try to create panic
in the family.

781
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,527
Yeah, I know, I know.
But not this guy.

782
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,224
This guy wanted it done
quickly. I know that.

783
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,529
Well, then you
missed something.

784
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,360
You've been
driving your motorcycle
all across the country,

785
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,929
working your bungee cord
jumping expeditions,
you're soft.

786
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,736
Hey, pal, it happens.

787
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,367
I'm not soft.

788
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,508
I'm sharper than
I've ever been.

789
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,171
Close your eyes.

790
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,613
(CHUCKLES)

791
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,577
No way, I'm not seven.

792
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,813
Close your eyes.
Any longer,
I'll think you're cheating.

793
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,018
(SIGHS)

794
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,558
How many hats are in the room?

795
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,297
All right, fine.

796
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,524
Just in case you're trying
to pull a fast one,

797
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,127
I'm not counting
the one in your pocket.

798
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,939
Nylon fishing hat on
the Ioner in the corner.

799
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,446
Foam cap on the kid
who's too young to know

800
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,506
they were lame
the first time
they came out.

801
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,246
Both truckers. One
a concrete company
I've never heard of,

802
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,515
the other advertising
free mustache rides.

803
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,750
I'm fairly certain no one's
taken him up on that offer.

804
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,689
Norwegian girl, ponytail
pulled out the back.

805
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:37,090
Unfortunately,
she's married,

806
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:41,154
and our friendly bartender,
wearing the official hat
of the restaurant.

807
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,595
Six hats.

808
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,060
And?

809
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:46,797
That's it.

810
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:48,936
Sorry, pal,
there are seven hats.

811
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,598
I can't help you.
You missed something.

812
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,608
I didn't miss anything.
There are seven hats, Shawn.

813
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,076
Were. Before I closed
my eyes.

814
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,945
Cowboy-hat walked out
while I was ridiculing
mustache-rides.

815
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,444
Come on, I heard her boots.

816
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,618
All right, close enough.

817
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,192
Close enough?
No, I nailed that.

818
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,030
Yeah, but you
changed the rules.

819
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:16,328
But, hey,
if it makes you happy.

820
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:20,062
Changed the rules?
I did not change
the rules.

821
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,799
What I did was nail it,
and you know it!

822
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,637
Shawn, you want my advice?

823
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,405
Go out, get yourself
a real job, grow up.

824
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,746
In the meantime,

825
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,783
you might wanna ask yourself
who you're trusting
in this case

826
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,648
and maybe you shouldn't.

827
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:39,186
'Cause obviously,
you're overlooking somebody.

828
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:40,883
Thanks for lunch.

829
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:49,598
Why are we at the
McCallum offices?

830
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,567
What is the magnification
on these things?

831
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:52,693
Two X.

832
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,102
Okay, we need to
stop at Wal-Mart
on the way home.

833
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,197
Why don't you just take
your big, loud motorcycle?

834
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,435
Oh, here we go,
here we go!

835
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,704
Oh, hell, no!

836
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,507
You got me out of work
so you could stalk a girl?

837
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,241
Damn it,
what is he doing here?

838
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:05,373
I can't believe this.

839
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,849
What's up with his hair?
It's horrible.

840
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,182
I knew I should've had him
picked up for questioning.

841
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,381
That is not the way
a grown man kisses
a grown woman.

842
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:13,787
We're fine.

843
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,417
Why does she look so nervous?

844
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,189
Oh, no.

845
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,195
Is it just me, or does that
bag look like it's filled

846
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,359
with stacks of ransom money?

847
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,235
Give me that.

848
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:29,230
Oh, my God!

849
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:30,500
Katarina...

850
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,007
It was her!

851
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,208
You're dating a murderer.

852
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,109
Not exclusively.

Too late for that.

860

What should we do?

864

00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,796
Just the bag, not the clothes.

I'll pay you for it.

I'll tell you that much.

Go, go, go!

00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,378
I can't believe you
sold me out like that!

911

You didn't tell me
I was a decoy!

912
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,343
Of course you're the decoy!

913
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:49,295
It seems pretty clean.

914
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,494
What, they didn't happen to
leave a ransom note inside?

915
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:54,668
Give me some money.
Get your own money.

916
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,638
Gus, I'll give it back.

917
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,543
Seriously,
this is all you carry?

918
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:14,487
Okay, so, we've got
five stacks going across,

919
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,958
and you figure
four going longways.

920
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:20,789
Ten stacks in each pile,
based on the wear
and the indentation.

921
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:23,628
I don't know, depending
on the denomination,

922
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,066
this could easily be
$5 million.

923
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:28,161
You're kidding.
Yeah, give or take.

924
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,967
You got that from the groove
on the side?

925
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,874
Oh, come on, Gus.
Any small child could
have figured that out.

926
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,044
So somebody at that house
did pay a ransom.

927
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:39,878
Mmm-hmm, or tried to.

928
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,344
Who?
I don't know.

929
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,817
We're gonna need
more than my psychic
powers to figure this out.

You here to scope out
the new meter maids?

931

Nope, I'm here to see you.

932
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:56,988
Not interested.

933
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,728
I know, you have
someone special.

934
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,497
He's married and<i>l</i>or separated.

935
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,697
Is there a point to this,
Mr. Spencer?

936
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,241
Of course. You and I have
something in common.

937
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:06,468
What's that?

938
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,535
We both know this case
is nowhere near closed.

939
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:14,846
Unfortunately, gut feelings
aren't admissible in
a California court.

940
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:17,380
How about motive?

941
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,512
What do you have?

942
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:21,455
Nothing yet.
But I've seen something.

943
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,960
Seen, or seen?

944
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:27,754
Well, what do you think?

945
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,189

on Malcolm Orso.

He was Camden's accomplice.

948
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:33,935
I'll get fired.

949
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,370
Will you really?
Because it seems
like a gray area to me.

950
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,964
That's the problem with you,
Mr. Spencer.

951
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,633
You live your entire life
in a gray area.

952
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:43,612
That's not true.
Though I generally
vacation in gray areas.

953
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,084
We can't talk here.

954
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:57,023
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.

955
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,459
It says Orso was seen in
the town, near the cabin.
Yeah.

956
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:03,795
Twice. Early in the week
by a store owner.

957
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,059
What was he buying?

958
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,760
Nothing. The old man
just saw him
on the street.

959
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,739
The same old man sees him
two times?

960
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,069
Yeah.

961
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:15,541
Orso had one of those
modified mufflers
on his Nova.

962
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,637
You could hear him
a block away.

970
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:03,655
It's a perfect match.

Damn!

972
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,468
I'm telling you,
there's no way Katarina's
gonna talk to you.

973
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:15,266
Yeah, well, I sort of
lied about that part.

We're not here
to see Katarina.

Who are we here to see?

976
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:21,702
This is highly
inappropriate,
Mr. Spencer.

977
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:23,676
The investigation is over.

978
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,408
What if they got
the wrong man?

the right man be?

Mr. McCallum, I didn't have
anything to do with this.

00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,604
I killed my own son?

00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:30,027
I know what your relationship
was with your son.

1024
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,431
Oh, really?

1025
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:34,094
I have a father that I
disappoint all the time.

1026
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,762
I'm sure you do.

1027
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,369
I know how you feel.
This was it.

1028
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,105
This was the straw that
broke the camel's back,
wasn't it?

1029
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:46,114
To think, 18 months ago,
he sat across from you,

1030
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,672
looked you right in the eye
and said,

1031
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:50,117
"Dad, I'm gonna clean up
my act this time.

1032
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:53,349
"This time, I'm gonna change,
I swear."

1033
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:57,525
To know that he duped you
and you fell for it
all over again,

1034
00:54:57,594 --> 00:55:00,791
must've sent you into
a state that even
you can't believe.

1035
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,426
Mr. Spencer,
I've been assured
by the Lieutenant Governor

1036
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:11,906
that this case will not cast
a pall over my family.

1037
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:15,342
But I can assure you,
it's gonna cast one
over yours.

1038
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:18,706
My very first case,
I'm already being
threatened. Wow!

1039
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,708
Shawn, let's go.

1040
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:22,843
I'm not quite finished.

1041
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:23,943
We're going, now.

1042
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,885
Listen to your friend.

1043
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:30,519
I'll be back.
No, you won't.

1044
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:39,201
Okay, we're going.
We're clearly going.
All right!

1045
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,997
Dude, what are you doing?
We had him on the ropes.

1046
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,369
It wasn't the right tack.

1047
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,340
Oh, you're the expert now?
Consumine.

1048
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:46,500
What?
Consumine.

1049
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,203
It's for dog bites.
I have some samples.

1050
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:49,711
Gus, what are you
saying to me?

1051
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:52,407
I'm saying there
was a bottle of it
in the medicine cabinet,

1052
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:53,972
prescribed Wednesday.

1053
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:58,146
You wonder why he had on
that long-sleeved shirt in
the heat that first day?

1054
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:00,519
Oh, my gosh!
That dog did have
blood on its teeth.

1055
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,649
I told you
it wasn't Snausages.

1056
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:09,925
We're never getting
back in there.
I know.

1057
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,799
Just give me a second.

1058
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,600
What are you doing?
I'm thinking.

1059
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:18,197
You look ridiculous.

1060
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,343
Now what are you doing?
Calling the cops.

1061
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:24,471
For what?

1062
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,742
You heard the guy in there.
They're never gonna come.

1063
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,114
I'm not calling
the cops on him,
I'm calling the cops on us.

1064
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:31,244
Gus, we need this to play out
in front of an audience,

1065
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:33,846
with all the major
players in place.
<i>WOMAN: Santa Barbara</i>
<i>Police Department.</i>

1066
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:36,585
(IN DEEP VOICE) Yes, hello.
I'm calling from the
McCallum residence.

1067
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,388
There's an intruder here.
He simply won't leave.

1068
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,588
He's claiming to be
a psychic that works
for your department.

1069
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:41,721
<i>Pardon me?</i>

1070
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:43,322
Mr. McCallum is enraged

1071
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,732
and he wants this handled
by the highest authority
possible.

1072
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:48,236
Please send the Chief
immediately.

1073
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:50,828
(SHAWN SNIFFS)

1074
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:55,902
Did you really vomit?

1075
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,581
Who called them?

1076
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:05,348
I don't know, sir,
maybe the back staff.

1077
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:07,781
Those two gentlemen
have not left the driveway.

1078
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,552
Would you like me to
send them all away?

1079
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:12,720
No, let's finish this.

1080
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,794
As you can see, Karen,
this simply cannot happen.

1081
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,994
It'll be taken care of,
believe me.

1082
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,162
He was given clear
instructions to stay away.

1083
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:23,637
I understand, but...

1084
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:26,732
Yeah, it's times like this
I remember why I love
my job so much.

1085
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:27,834
Anytime, Shawn.

1086
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,902
He's getting cocky,
give it a sec.

1087
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:31,640
We're gonna be at
city jail in a sec.

1088
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,944
Uh-huh. Here we are.

1089
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,284
(EXCLAIMS)
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did that hurt?

1090
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:40,683
Something's happening!

1091
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,552
Gus, something's happening!

1092
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:44,854
(GROANING)
Stop it.

1093
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:46,953
(EXCLAIMING)

1094
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,292
Wait.

1095
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,730
The dog!
Shut up.

1096
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,960
He's biting the intruder!

1097
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:57,762
He knows him.

1098
00:57:57,841 --> 00:57:59,706
It's someone he knows!
The dog knows him!

1099
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,368
Stop talking!
Ouch!

1100
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:03,435
The teeth are digging in!

1101
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,504
Shut up!
Now there's blood!

1102
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,809
(SHAWN SCREAMING)

1103
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:09,784
It's him, it's McCallum!

1104
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:12,754
I can see his face!
The killer is McCallum!

1105
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:13,811
Check his wrist!

1106
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,188
Check his right wrist!
The teeth marks will match up!

1107
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:17,317
Get him out of here!

1108
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:18,655
Check the wrist!

1109
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,787
No one is checking
any part of me!

1110
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:22,990
Why not?

1111
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,192
Huh?

1112
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,562
We could close
this out immediately,
discredit him right here.

1113
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:32,299
That's an awful wound
you have bandaged there.

1114
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:35,572
This is outrageous!
Do you really want
to do this?

1115
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:39,437
I could do this now,
or I could call in
a warrant.

1116
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,813
I'll call my lawyer.

1117
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:44,176
I'll be right here.

1118
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:46,516
I see a doctor!

1119
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:48,648
I'm seeing a doctor,
Dr. Mandali,

1120
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:52,752
and a word, "Consumine!"
Yeah, it's for dog bites!

1121
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:55,798
The wound is fresh!
Check the wound!

1122
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:59,134
SHAWN: It's a fresh wound,
it's still a fresh wound!

1123
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,375
(STAMMERING) It was
an accident, I didn't...

1124
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:09,503
What?

1125
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,282
Sergeant.

1126
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:19,554
OFFICER: This way, sir.

1127
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:25,091
You wanna take these cuffs
off of me, please?

1128
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,660
Thank you.

1129
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,762
Seriously, how?

1130
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:39,140
I wish I knew.

1131
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,608
Do you think
this pretty much ruins
my chances with Katarina?

1132
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:06,294
There she is!

1133
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,769
Don't ever walk into my
office without knocking.

1134
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:10,465
I'm sorry, I got excited.

1135
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,064
You know what
I'll do to you?
Yes.

1136
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:13,836
You do?
I'm a psychic.

1137
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,272
I am just finishing up
in here, I'll be with
you in a moment.

1138
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,577
That's all right, Karen.
I've got to get going
anyway.

1139
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:20,809
Thank you very much
for coming down.

1140
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:23,078
Yeah. Okay.
You've been a big help.

1141
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:25,845
Son.
Dad.

1142
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,489
Have a seat.

1143
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,792
I was considering adding
you to my speed dial,
Mr. Spencer,

1144
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:38,163
but I would be remiss
if I didn't do a little
background check,

1145
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:39,360
don't you think?

1146
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:42,199
Yes.

1147
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,440
I asked your dad how long
you've had the gift.

1148
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:47,340
Look, my father's memory
is pretty cloudy.

1149
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,002
It certainly is.

1150
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,979
His recollection
doesn't match up
with your assertion at all.

1151
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:53,106
I can explain that.

1152
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,946
You said you've
had this ability
your whole life.

1153
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:59,420
Well, whole life... I mean,
it's a bit of a gray area.

1154
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,980
He said you didn't get it
until you were 18.

1155
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:04,923
He said that?
Mmm-hmm.

1156
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:10,091
Wow, that is just like him.

1157
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,860
The man simply refuses
to acknowledge
my abilities, my gifts.

1158
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:17,336
Can we discuss my fee?

1159
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:21,072
There's a check in the cage.

1160
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:24,569
Sign for it,
and then come back in.

1161
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:27,415
Come... Come back in here?
Mmm-hmm.

1162
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:28,541
Why?

1163
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,953
You familiar with
a chop shop in Summerland?

1164
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:36,817
Dad!

1165
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:42,227
So, are you gonna continue
with this little charade?

1166
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:45,495
Well, it sort of gives me
carte blanche, you know?

1167
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:49,026
I mean, I can work cases
for the department,
I can do private jobs.

1168
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,733
In fact, I've already
got another case.

1169
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:53,405
Be aware.

1170
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,305
This is the last time
I cover for you, pal.

1171
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:02,650
I'm not okay with this,
Shawn, any of it.

1172
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,195
I don't expect you to be, Dad.

1173
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:41,985
Awesome!

1174
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:49,991
Psych?

1175
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,095
As in gotcha.

1176
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:55,160
Or as in psychic.

1177
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,475
You named your fake
detective agency Psych?

1178
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:02,237
Why don't you just call it,

1179
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:04,472
"Hey, we're fooling you
and the police department.

1180
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:06,947
"Hope we don't make a mistake
and somebody dies
because of it."

1181
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:08,779
First of all, Gus, that
name is entirely too long,

1182
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:10,284
it would never fit
on the window.

1183
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:13,288
And, secondly, the best
way to convince people
you're not lying to them,

1184
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:15,290
is to tell them you are!

1185
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:18,683
Whatever, Shawn.
It's your agency, go for it.

1186
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:22,359
Actually, it's our agency.

1187
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:26,324
I put your name
on the lease as well.

1188
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:28,233
Tell me, does that look
anything like your signature?

1189
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,362
I gave it a shot.

1190
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:30,700
This better be a joke.

1191
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:33,105
Don't worry, you won't
have to do a thing.

1192
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:35,201
I've worked out
every last detail.

1193
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,303
What's your dental plan?
Don't get cavities.

1194
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,848
Health plan?
Same, but with hepatitis
and shingles.

1195
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,440
So, I'm supposed
to quit my job,

1196
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:43,348
skip over and do this
for no guaranteed money.

1197
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:46,149
No guaranteed money,
but all guaranteed fun.

1198
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:49,521
No. No more cases, Shawn.
It was fun for a few days.

1199
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:54,386
Well, it's gonna have to
be fun for
a minimum of six months,

1200
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,828
or we'll have to pay
a lease penalty,

1201
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:59,732
which would be a blemish
on your otherwise very
impressive credit report.

1202
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:03,067
You solved one mystery,
and now you're renting
office space?

1203
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:06,040
Gus, I've solved
a bunch of mysteries.

1204
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:08,906
For instance, the mystery
of who kept stealing your
newspaper.

1205
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:10,468
Answer: Me!

1206
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:14,004
The mystery of what
we're doing this weekend.
Hint, it involves dragsters.

1207
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:17,416
And finally, the mystery
that is the case

1208
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:19,818
the Chief just
brought me in on.

1209
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:22,788
You got another case already?

1210
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,656
A car thief got poisoned
by his boss.

1211
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:28,424
He used something
over the counter.
Fizadine.

1212
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:31,022
No, Fizaderbal. No...

1213
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:33,868
Fizadrine?
That's it!

1214
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:36,496
Wow. How'd he do that?

1215
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:38,403
I'll tell you on the way.

1216
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,636
Just for today, right?
Absolutely.

1217
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:54,423
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>That I'm not telling the truth</i>

1218
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:57,482
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>They just don't have any proof</i>

1219
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,791
<i>Embrace the deception</i>
<i>Learn how to bend</i>

1220
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:04,924
<i>Your worst inhibitions</i>
<i>tend to psych you out</i>
<i>in the end</i>

1221
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:06,559
<i>I know, you know</i>

1222
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:10,063
<i>I know, you know</i>

1223
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,500
<i>I know, you know</i>

1224
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,039
<i>I know, you know</i>

1225
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:29,183
<i>In between the lines</i>
<i>there's a lot of obscurity</i>

1226
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,716
<i>I'm not inclined</i>
<i>to resign to maturity</i>

1227
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:35,958
<i>If it's all right</i>
<i>then you're all wrong</i>

1228
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:39,991
<i>But why bounce around</i>
<i>to the same damn song</i>

1229
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:44,864
<i>You'd rather run</i>
<i>when you can't crawl</i>

1230
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:50,467
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>That I'm not telling the truth</i>

1231
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:53,606
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>They just don't have any proof</i>

1232
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:56,846
<i>Embrace the deception</i>
<i>Learn how to bend</i>

1233
01:05:56,919 --> 01:06:01,686
<i>Your worst inhibitions</i>
<i>tend to psych you out</i>
<i>in the end</i>
