00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,328
SHAWN: I need 80 cents.

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,735
No, you don't. You need
to put back two of those
extra candy bars

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,102
that you just picked up.

4
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,731
Dad, you don't
understand.

5
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,571
I can't put back
one of these.

6
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,840
That would be like saying
one of these candy bars is
less worthy than the others.

7
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,642
And I can't play
those kinds of favorites.

8
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,046
All right, fine.
Enjoy your dilemma.

9
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,142
In the meantime,
don't drag Gus into it.

10
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,345
Thanks, Mr. Spencer.

11
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,580
HENRY: No problem.

12
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:22,882
Switch places with me.

13
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,184
No.
Why not?

14
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,623
Because then
you'll try to take
whatever money I have left.

15
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,251
And when have I tried
to do that to you?

16
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,989
Wednesday and Saturday.

17
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,257
Monday.

18
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,661
Gosh, you guys
have scary memories.

19
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,098
Next in line, please.

20
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,533
That's you.
No.

21
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,503
Shawn, come on. That's you.

22
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,836
Okay, so, all of these?

(ALARM BLARING)

24
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,637
Oh, my gosh!
It happened here?

The one-millionth customer.

26
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,236
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,576
Don't be sorry, kid.
You won!

28
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,911
He won? He won what?

29
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:55,114
All kinds of things.
Gift certificates,
that cool bike up there.

30
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:59,086
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we have it!</i>
<i>Our one-millionth customer!</i>

31
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,317
Can I use one of my
gift certificates now?

32
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,452
Sure.

33
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,895
Cool!
Isn't it awesome?

34
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,592
Isn't this cool, Gus?
How lucky am I?

35
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,602
AMANDA: Thanks for doing this.

But then is also
open to seeing where
the night goes, you know?

41
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,910
You could've thought
I was weird asking you out

42
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:26,713
because you walked
by my counter.

43
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:27,844
I don't call that weird.

44
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,948
I call that blind, dumb,
stupid, awe-inspired luck.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

46
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,052
I'm gonna get drinks.

47
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,993
Two vodka sodas.

48
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,696
I've just decided
I am going to
experience life.

49
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,500
You know, try new things.

50
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,473
I signed up for
a painting class today.

51
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,941
You know, they make
the kind of paint
you can eat now.

52
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,537
And I'm giving
new focus to my job.

53
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,241
So...

54
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,376
Can I ask you a question?

55
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,612
Anything.

56
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,121
Did you just get out
of a relationship?

57
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,281
How did you know?

58
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,722
Just a wild guess.

59
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,282
Was it

60
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,487
today?

61
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,257
Yesterday.

62
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,265
Are you sure
you should be out
dating already?

63
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,198
Yes, of course.

64
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,065
He was cheating on me.

65
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:19,735
Cheating?
Yeah.

66
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,674
And the stupid thing is
I thought everything was going
really well, you know?

67
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,644
And then he just started
getting all weird
the last month.

68
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,471
Lying, going
through my stuff,

69
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,549
my address book, my jewelry.

70
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,951
Finally, Friday he tells me
he's going to watch
the game at a friend's.

71
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,851
A co-worker of mine
spots him over at
the Eastland center.

72
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,520
He may not accept
it yet, but we are
definitely finished.

73
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,127
Thank you.
I hope you don't mind
being a rebound.

74
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,190
Oh, I usually prefer it.

75
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,861
But not in this case.

76
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:52,995
Why not?

77
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,601
Primarily because
he's not cheating on you.

78
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,337
Look, he took your jewelry
because he's trying
to figure out your ring size.

79
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,850
He took you to Tiffany's
to buy that fancy necklace

80
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,217
because he's really trying
to scout out what kind of
stones and settings you like.

81
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,721
What about last Friday?

82
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,279
Oh, come on.
The Eastland center?

83
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,723
There's no bars
or clubs there.
He wasn't there with a chick.

84
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,158
He was probably
in the north side
of the parking lot

85
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,061
at Robbins Bros.,
picking out the ring.

86
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,093
My address book?

87
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,760
Called your parents
to ask for your hand.
He's doing it right.

88
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,166
Do you think
I should call him?

89
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,501
I'll let you be
a psychic on that one.

90
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,441
Ray? Yeah, I need you
to tell me the truth.

91
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:37,108
If you lie to me,
we will never speak again,
do you understand?

92
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,815
About Friday.
Who were you with?

93
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,180
Take your time.

95
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,425
Spencer. Why am I surprised?

96
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:56,826
Why are you wasted?

97
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,428

like Scotch? Miss!

of these, please? Thank you.

something I have got
to get off my chest.

100
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,639

Please say no.

102
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,348
astound me.

103

Come again?

104
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,111
It's beyond astounding.

105
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,557
It is some of the most
impressive reasoning
I've ever seen.

106
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,322
Is there a punch
line coming?
Let's get to it.

107
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,657
I don't know how you do it.

108
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,496
I mean, it's not psychic-ness,
we both know
that's a crock of crap.

109
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,996
But you, sir, are unstoppable,

00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,031
What's happening here?

112
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,898
Can I tell you a secret?

113
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,501
I wouldn't recommend it, no.

114
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,944
Listen,

115
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,472
you know how everyone thinks
my wife and I have been
separated for nine months?

116
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,983
Yes.

117
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,643
Two years. Two years tonight.

118
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,354
And I'm the one
who keeps trying
to fix the thing.

119
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,220
I mean...
Jeez.

120
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,921
...counseling, therapy,
acupuncture, you name it.

121
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,692
I have tried to
try to try it.

122
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,899
Well, I'm gonna
let you go.

123
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,197
Don't drive.

124
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,574
You know,
I used to be a good cop.
Seriously.

125
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,973
Stunning arrest record.
It was one of the best
in the department.

126
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,980
I caught the
Back Bay killer.

127
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,538
Yes, you did.
I remember it well.

128
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,413
Although I had a tip.
The blue sedan.

129
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,473
Yeah.

130
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,448
That was you?

131
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,015
It might have been.
See what I mean?

132
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,526
Come on, you still had to
put it all together, right?

133
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,994
Look, Spencer,
the blue sedan was
the key to the whole thing.

134
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,224
It was the murderer's car.

135
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,959
Yeah, but who had to
run the plates?

136
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,002
And all those numbers
and letters could have
confused many a cop.

137
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,868
Spencer, stop, okay?
I am done.

138
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,932
Here, I want you
to have these.
I don't need them.

139
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,844
I am over.

140
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,045
All right, just stop this.
This is nonsense.

141
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,548
You're not over.

142
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,710
Look, you're a
striking man with
strong features,

143
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:57,153
eyes that women
want to do
cannonballs into.

144
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:01,282
You have great posture
and penmanship
the likes I've never seen.

145
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,558
No, I have officially
hit rock bottom.

146
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,621
A month ago,
I got this case, right?

147
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,532
A healthy <i>4</i>2- year-old
astronomer dies.

smoke, spends all day

in an ergonomically-designed
chair, charting the night sky.

150
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,774
Natural causes,
that's what the Coroner
comes back with.

151
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,074
Does a full autopsy.
No red flags. Nothing.

152
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,843
I know he was murdered.
I just can't...

153
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,852
What? What?
What is this?

154
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,978
...prove it!

155
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,722
The department won't even
let me pursue it.

156
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,816
Come on, you'll
figure it out.

157
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,920
No, I won't. I can't.
And I've accepted that.

158

<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>That I'm not telling the truth</i>

175
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,676
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>They just don't have any proof</i>

176
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,913
<i>Embrace the deception</i>
<i>Learn how to bend</i>

177
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:38,821
<i>Your worst inhibitions</i>
<i>tend to psych you out</i>
<i>in the end</i>

178
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,392
(WHISPERS) Check this out.
GUS: What?

179
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,956
Hey, Lassy.

180
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,260
What is it, Spencer?

181
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,835
How you doing?
You okay?

182
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,869
All right. I'll bite.
What's the joke?

183
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,974
Just want to make sure
you got home all right
last night.

184
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,067
From what?

185
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,543
From the bar.
What bar?

186
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,273
You were at a bar?
No, I wasn't at a bar.

187
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,470
I don't drink.

188
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,606
You don't drink?

189
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,652
Well, okay.
Wine at weddings.

190
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,481
Occasional snifter
of brandy.

191
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,445
Maybe a single-malt scotch.

192
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,649
Sounds like drinking to me.

193
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:15,455
Spencer, why don't you stop
making up stories, okay?
They're obviously bogus.

194
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,122
Okay, so you were not
at Tom Blair's Pub last night?

195
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,925
I don't even know
who Tom Blair is.

196
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,127
Mmm-hmm.
And how'd you get that sweet
bruise on your forehead?

197
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,493
I had an altercation.

198
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,867
Yes, with a table.

199
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:26,996
CARLTON: With a suspect.

200
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,270
If we're done,
I would really like
to move on with my day.

201
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,640
I get it.

202
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,570
Yesterday was

203
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,479
a tough anniversary for you.

204
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,674
What?

205
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,210
Who've you
been talking to?

206
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,781
Nobody.

207
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,590
I'll get out
of your hair.

208
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,254
Okay. We gotta solve
that case.

209
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,320
What case?

210
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,491
The one Lassiter
can't solve.

211
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,864
He's gonna hire us
for a case?

212
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,232
Oh, God, no.
He'd never do that.

213
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,168
So, we won't get paid?
Exactly.

214
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,671
And we're just
doing it for the glory?
Nope.

215
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,298
We give Lassiter
all the credit.

216
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,173
In fact, I don't even
think he can know
we're helping him.

217
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,576
Dude, that's
a good idea, Shawn.

218
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,910
I ditch out of work
on the day we release
three new products

219
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,984
to spend time
on an unsolvable case

220
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,485
in which we won't get
paid and someone else
gets all the credit.

221
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,250
That, quite honestly,
is some of the best
nut-shelling I've ever heard.

222
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,984
We made a deal.
Yesterday.

223
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,652
We're equal partners.
That means we
collectively decide

224
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,752
which appointments to make,
which cases to take.

225
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,161
We have to live by that,
at least for a day,
especially today.

226
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,426
You're right.
Thank you.

227
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,161
It's gonna be a
problem, though.
Why?

228
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,998
'Cause we've already
got a meeting
with the dead guy's widow.

229
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,094
When?
Ten minutes.

230
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,263
Ten minutes?
Look, don't worry.

231
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,806
I'm gonna do it
in the Chief's office.

232
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,672
Just need you to stand guard
at the door, make sure
no one catches us in there.

233
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,177
It's gonna double
the excitement.
Maybe triple it.

234
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,305
Now, come on, who's in?

235
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,370
Don't fool around.

236
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,440
You know I can't
hold my hand like
this for very long.

237
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,385
Gus, I get very
poor circulation to
the limbic regions.

238
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,519
And now my
pinky's going numb.

239
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,961
I guess everything started
to change at the beginning
of last summer.

240
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,360
He partnered with his
old friend, Hugo,

241
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,162
and they finally
got accepted
for eight months

242
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,668
on the new digital telescope
at the Space Center.

243
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,228
Everything was normal
for two weeks and then,

244
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,568
suddenly, Bryant
started to work
really long hours.

245
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:10,836
I see.

246
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,338
What do you think of this?

247
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,401
I like it.

248
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,813
It was a gift. A friend.
He's a glass blower.

249
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,183
Would you say
that's when he started
feeling sick, Mary?

250
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,278
Not sick,
just a little off.

251
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,551
Oh! We did cancel
our Fourth of July trip,

252
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,559
so I guess it was
around that time.

253
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,685
I'm sorry,
something is really
bugging me.

254
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,354
Your name is Lassiter, too?

255
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,126
Yes, that's correct.
Carlton Lassiter.

256
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,068
But you're not affiliated
with the detective Carlton
Lassiter who I met before?

257
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,867
Not in any way,
shape or form.
Different department.

258
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,534
Matter of fact,
I spell mine with a "K."

259
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,105
Two of them.

260
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,681
Mary, is there anything
you're leaving out?

261
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,613
Maybe something that's
slipped your mind,

262
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,277
something you're
not telling me because

263
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:58,383
it may embarrass
and<i>l</i>or shame you.

264
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,118
It could be vital.

265
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:03,654
I know this probably
isn't true, but I started
to suspect that he...

266
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,219
Was cheating on you.

267
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,958
Well, yes.
How did you know?

268
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,057
A shot in the dark.

269
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,932
The long hours.
He was consumed
with his work.

270
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,769
He was different. Distant.
I don't even like
to say it out loud.

271
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,000
Please, don't.

272
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:20,512
Bryant wasn't really the type.
We were planning a future.
He wanted to try for a baby.

273
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,206
He was a good man.

274
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,144
Thanks again for
coming in, Mary.

275
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,979
No problem, Kkarlton.

276
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,053
If we uncover any...
Carlton?

277
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,612
Yes, Karlton, with a "K."

278
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,590
Two "K"s.
The second one
is silent.

279
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,693
May I speak to you
privately in your
office, Kkarlton?

280
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,957
Certainly.

281
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,555
We'll be in touch.
Thanks.

282
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,365
What are you doing reopening
the Vallery case?

283
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,962
Reopening? Come on.
That word has
so many syllables.

284
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,132
That case was determined
not to be a case,

285
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,472
despite Detective Lassiter's
best efforts.

286
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,838
Shawn!

287
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:57,043
Now, I need a
whole lot of an
explanation from you,

288
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,880
because, although you do
make me laugh occasionally,

289
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,317
impersonating an officer is...

290
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,752
Impersonating an officer?
Please.

291
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,290
I told that woman
I was in accounts payable.

292
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,052
Shawn, come clean.

293
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,754
I would like to solve
this case for Lassiter.

294
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,888
He'll never allow it.

295
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,261
That's why he can't
know I'm involved.

296
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,766
I figure I can
guide him through
this thing, right?

297
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,735
Build him up,
get him back
on his feet again.

298
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,293
You're serious?
Yeah.

299
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,633
Why?

300
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,071
I just feel like
he really needs this.

301
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,934
I mean, look at him.

302
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,506
Okay, I'm in.

303
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:30,806
You're what?

304
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,009
What do you got?

305
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,788
My Dad is not answering
his phone.
So?

306
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,264
So, he's always home,
and he always answers
his phone after two rings.

307
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,425
This is actually
somewhat troubling.

308
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,491
Why?

309
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,302
Why? Fish Derby is on.

310
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,396
What is this?

311
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,565
It's the Bryant Vallery case.

312
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:56,699
The one from this morning?

313
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,800
And the rest
of the week.

314
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:01,176
I predict we will solve it
Friday at 10:01 p.m.

315
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,844
And then maybe
watch some cable.

316
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:03,904
Sounds great.

317
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,917
And did you find
a partner that's willing
to do this with you?

318
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,512
Jules is in.
My Dad is clearly
missing, or something.

319
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,614
Dude, that leaves you!

320
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,453
Gus, you get to step up
in a big fat way.

321
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,892
You have one job.
I have two jobs, Shawn.

322
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,225
I have presentations
to memorize
on three new drugs.

323
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,164
And while you were out
drinking last night
and taking on free cases,

324
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,325
I was up half the night
dreaming about

325
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,232
whether the gel caps
are more effective
than the tablets.

326
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,000
First of all, tablets.
Always tablets,
that's a given.

327
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,868
Secondly, I've been having
this reoccurring dream

328
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:35,037
where I'm flying over Auckland
on the back of a swan
made primarily of cocoa.

329
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,614
His name is Clem.

330
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,984
But your dream was
pretty interesting, too.

331
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:44,313
And thirdly,
I guarantee you that
after you hear this reason,

332
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,187
you will definitely want
to take this case.

333
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,192
I doubt it
but give it a shot.

334
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,694
The victim was
an astronomer. Yeah.

335
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:54,164
The guy died while he was
working the night sky
at the observatory.

336
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,600
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)

337
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,333
What would make you think
that would matter?

338
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,932
Oh, come on!
I know you go down
to the Space Center.

339
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,601
That's preposterous, Shawn.
Thursdays.

340
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,942
I'm never down...
In the afternoon,

341
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,002
Have you been following me?

342
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,776
Maybe. Sometimes.

343
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,012
To sharpen and refine
my tailing skills, yes.

344
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,054
This is exactly
the sort of thing
I was talking about, Shawn.

345
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,783
Okay, I apologize,
Gus, I do. But
it's all good.

346
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,917
So you like astronomy.
I accept that.

347
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,085
This conversation is over.

348
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,152
Okay, don't go all
Vincent Gallo on me.

started, man.

350
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,367
Look, some guy dies
at a Space Center that
you frequently sneak off to.

351
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:33,599
We gotta get down
there and we gotta do
some serious space digging.

352
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,264
No, we don't.
As a matter of fact,

353
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,332
now that I know
that you're tailing me
while I'm at work,

354
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,569
get ready to get
lost in my dust.

355
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:39,770
Okay. Dust?

356
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:40,903
What, are you
going off-roading?

357
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,141
I'm gonna be un-catchable,
like a jackal.

358
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,477
Like a jackal?

359
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,352
How about I just tail you
to the observatory?

360
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,478
Consider me stealth, Shawn.

361
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,854
That's weird.
It's like you're
a bobble head.

She just had...

Broke up with

It's my curse, apparently.

off a break-up,
I gotta move gradually.

Yes. Gus is
a regular.

416
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,875
That's right.

417
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,818
You know,
I went to high school
with him.

418
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,687
Of course, I didn't hang out
with cool kids like Gus
in high school.

419
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,249
He was a CIF

back then.

And in college,
he was a Heisman candidate

00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,026
till he blew his knee out.

a planetarium show to start.

on the show?

like, an hour ago.

You what?
You asked me to.

449
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,954
I did?
It was in passing.

did it ever pay off!

about the affair.
I was?

452

totally suspected it.
She what?

That he potentially was
having an affair.

all you got to do

507
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,146
is watch the monitor,
hoping to catch things
that nobody else has.

508
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,851
You know,
if you got a partner,
you can switch off,

509
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:44,157
you know, rest your eyes,
maybe make calculations
on what you've seen,

510
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:47,824
or just break up the silence
of staring into the unknown.

511
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,992
So, where's your partner?

512
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:51,994
Yeah, well that's
the bad part of it.

513
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,368
He passed away
not too long ago.

514
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,675
You know,
the Buddhists have
this saying about moving on,

515
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,337
honoring the work...
But I don't remember it.

516
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:04,246
What I do know is that
I realize I'm too old to be
doing this stuff all alone.

517
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,551
So, you're
continuing the work, huh?

518
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,611
Bryant would return
from the grave if I didn't.

519
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,452
You know, we petitioned
for five years
for use of this scope.

520
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,722
And we got lucky.
No, no, no.
No, no. Don't touch, no.

521
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,662
I mean, once you get
in here, you gotta find
what you're looking for, fast.

522
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,291
We had eight months.
Bryant saw six.

523
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,226
Eight months seems like
a good chunk of time.

524
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,826
Not in astronomy.

525
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,395
See, once you find it,
you gotta track it.

526
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,668
Okay? And then it's
not a discovery
until you chart it

527
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,176
and then it goes around
again and then you prove it.

528
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,145
Must get Ionely.

529
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,737
I let you in
here, didn't I?

530
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,514
Look, I just talk. You know?
I've got the gift of gab.

531
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,179
Jeez, I'll talk
to anybody, I suppose.

532
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,156
So, you still haven't found
what you're looking for, huh?

533
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:50,593
No, but when I do,
you'll read about it,
believe me.

534
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:51,923
You'll read about it.

535
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,088
JESSICA: My real goal is
to become an astronomer.

536
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,565
See something no one else has.

537
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:59,434
I don't even need to make
a big, flashy discovery,
or name a star,

538
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,404
or become famous like
most of these guys want.

539
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,497
Yeah.

540
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,940
All I've ever really
wanted is to know
I made a difference.

541
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,570
That's great,
knowing what you want to do
since you were a kid.

542
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:08,738
That's a gift.

543
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:09,906
Thanks.

544
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,380
You know,
you're a great
listener, Gus.

545
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,783
Oh, well, it's easy
to talk to you, Jessica.
I mean, it's...

546
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,115
Is something wrong?

547
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,985
They've been in
there <i>4</i>5 minutes.

548
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,114
So?

549
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,749
It's a four-minute show.

550
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,124
And that,
ladies and gentlemen,
is precisely why

551
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:27,928
time travel is
not only possible,
but may have already happened.

other astronomer.

555
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,978
Nice guy. Chatty.
Hiding something.

556
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,072
Something nefarious?

557
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,878
I don't know yet.
How'd you do?

558
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,976
Please, Shawn.
How do you think?

00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,248
(GASPING) Digits?
You know this.

560
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,256
Nice!
We're going
out tomorrow.

561
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,224
It's all coming
together, man.

562
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,317
Juliet called.
She ran our dead
guy's phone records.

563
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,486
We gotta meet her
at the station.

564
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,257
You bet, let's go.
Whoa! Not now.

565
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,889
5:00.
Why 5:00?

566
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,367
Gus, I can't just
leave willy-nilly
whenever I want.

567
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,296
I have a job to do here.

568
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,513
I don't care what the
Coroner says. Healthy
hearts do not just stop.

569
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,616
But you know what?
I got a golf buddy
who's a cardiologist.

570
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,911
I'm gonna run
these by him.

571
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,680
Mind the store,
I'll be back.

572
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,285
(WHISPERING) Hey!

573
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,158
Okay, so we ran the home,
the work, and the cell phone
records of Bryant Vallery.

574
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:33,163
We got nothing
on the home phone, a few
strange hits on the work line,

575
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,529
but when we ran
the cell phone,
we hit the jackpot.

576
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,194
We found a number
that he calls, only
from his cell phone,

577
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,636
all hours of the night,
way too often for business.

578
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,434
Unless it's
monkey business.
Sweet!

579
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,805
So we contacted
the cell phone company
for the name.

580
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:49,609
The number is 555-019...

581
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,148
Where is it?

582
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,288
Oh, here it is.

583
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,620
555-019...

584
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,292
Wow, that's good.

585
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,692
Not really.

586
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,266
SHAWN: So, she had an affair
with a married guy
and probably lied about it.

587
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:14,396
That doesn't
mean she's guilty.

588
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,066
Shawn, you're confusing me.
You're the one who loves
to jump to conclusions,

589
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,166
and you're not
even hopping
towards this one.

590
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,540
Hopping?
It doesn't track, Gus.

591
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,306
Why would she kill him?
She broke up with a guy.

592
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,676
It's him.
He dumped her.

593
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,805
So, why doesn't she
mention to you

594
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,349
that her ex-boyfriend
just bit the dust?

595
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,045
What's she gonna say?
"Hey, how's it going?
My boyfriend just died.

"He might have been killed.
Maybe it was me."

Damn, she was so

And she still is, Gus.

Even if we have a who,
we don't have a clear motive

and we certainly
don't have the method.

on our other suspects.

You're gonna
set off the alarm.

607
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,136
Clearly, I have
a security pass.

608
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,366
They gave you
a security pass?

609
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,432
They gave Dave
the cheddar corn guy
a security pass,

610
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,443
I merely stumbled
upon it by happenstance.

611
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,637
And by happenstance,
you mean?

from his gym bag

from the vending machine.

What are you
doing, Shawn?

have is a key.

I left my pogo stick
in there and I just...

No, I mean you're
not doing it right.

latch to disengage.

it away a few weeks
after they got here.

missing and suddenly

Did you read it?
Well, of course I did.

You know, he became
quite a jerk. I don't know
if Hugo knows this or not,

went down in there.

In fact, Hugo's the only one
around here who's nice to me.

in the mornings,

it for everybody,

out of my locker. Okay?

Hey, do you know
how these books work?

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,904
Oh, they switch up
every couple of hours.
One looks, one writes.

657
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:36,003
Yeah, they do it
from dark till dusk
all the time.

at the same time
every day.

What?

665
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,229
Look, there's a page missing
from this logbook.

666
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,789

the book track?

670
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,803
It's like Stallings said.
It's like, every manual
adjustment they make,

671
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,570
who does it, which
guy was on the scope.

672
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,237
See, it looks like they
switch shifts about
every two hours. Right?

673
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,678
So, why remove this page?

674
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,717
It goes from 8:39 with Hugo
to 10:<i>4</i>2 with Bryant.

675
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:18,051
So the question is,
what happened between 8:39
and 10:<i>4</i>2 on June 21st?

676
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,647
Some bad juju.

677
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,191
We gotta get out of here.

678
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,926
Why?
Why?

679
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:26,122
Gus, someone finds
me in here,
I could get fired.

680
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,829
Why do you keep
running like that?

681
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:32,527
JESSICA: Hey, you guys.

682
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,162
Hey. What's up?

683
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:35,596
Gus, about tonight...

684
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,607
Oh, if you have
other obligations,
that's cool.

685
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:40,576
No, I just wanted to
see if we could go
at 6:30 instead.

686
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,737
That's perfect.
That's even better.

687
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,578
Look, I need to borrow
your motorcycle tonight.

688
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,776
You can use
my little blue car.

689
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:47,977
Oh, yeah!
Do that, Gus.

690
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,952
I get a little nervous
on motorcycles.

691
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,716
Settled! Bye, Jess.

692
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,848
Bye.

693
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,427
HUGO: Think you
want this one.

694
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,466
What's that
in his case?

695
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,263
Tracking readouts.

696
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,369
Dude, it's just a bunch
of paperwork. I saw it
at the observatory.

697
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:08,700
Why does he keep it
locked up like that?

698
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:09,797
That's a
good question.

699
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,842
Morning, gentlemen.
You up already?

700
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,037
I had to check
the timers on
the crab spray.

701
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,602
You need any help
with that giant thing?

702
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,806
Nah, I can manage it.

703
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,815
Only got two more weeks
of this before my time's up.

704
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,078
Might as well follow it
through to the end.

705
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,144
You know
what that means.

706
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,450
I have no idea
what that means.

707
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,855
That means he's
not at his house.

708
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,554
So?

709
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,828
SHAWN: Rainier's not exactly
a high roller, huh?

710
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:33,955
GUS: No.
Look at that.

711
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,262
It should say,
"Welcome to camp something."

712
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,699
Huh!

713
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,203
Stargazing isn't the
most lucrative field.

714
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:43,138
Well, you can make up to
a hundred grand a year on
the lecture circuit

715
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,197
if you're a name.

716
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,640
(GRUNTS)

717
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,012
You're gonna break that.

718
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:50,736
(GRUNTS)

719
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:52,877
I don't think so!

720
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,453
Whoa!
What?

721
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,349
Oh, boy!

722
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,792
What is this
awful purple stuff?

723
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,318
They're flowers.

724
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,622
Flowers?
It's a garden.

725
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:08,358
It's a vegetable garden.
These are flowers,
weird flowers.

726
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,730
What are you doing?

727
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:10,890
Well, I gotta
check this out.

728
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,061
Let Lassiter do that.

729
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,434
Gus, Lassiter has
to come here on his own.

730
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,598
And he has gotta be right.

731
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,733
So, who you gonna get
to check that out for us?

732
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,643
Well, who else do
you know who spends
all day in his yard?

733
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,174
(GROANS)

734
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,112
Shawn!

735
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,484
Oh, you shouldn't have.

736
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,520
Dad, we need to
talk business.

737
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,021
You're not answering
your phone. What's going
on? Did you even check it?

738
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,648
My phone's been fine, Shawn.

739
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,124
I'm just a little
busy right now.

740
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,854
Busy with what?
Things, Shawn.

741
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:37,917
I have things.

742
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,931
WOMAN: Henry, where
are the towels?

743
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,259
Yeah, I'll tell
you in a minute.

744
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,268
(STAMMERING) Was that a woman?
You have a woman in there?

745
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:48,771
What do you think?

746
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,671
Where did you meet a woman?

747
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,731
Are you really interested?

748
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,243
(STAMMERING) It's a question,
Dad. It's an enquiry.

749
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,677
On the Internet.

750
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,874
Shawn, look, she's
a very nice lady.
Her name is Sylvia.

751
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:01,112
She runs a catering
business, has two kids.

752
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,013
Would you like to meet her?

753
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,282
Oh, God, no!
Are you kidding?

754
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,547
Good. Can we pick
this up tomorrow?

755
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,189
Yeah, I'd be glad to.

756
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,420
Good.

757
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,029
(EXCLAIMS)

758
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,933
You must have thought
your Dad dated again.

759
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,234
Honestly, Gus, I haven't
given it a lot of thought.

760
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,104
It's been 15 years.

761
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,504
Yeah, you know what?
It's fine. It's great.
Good for him.

762
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:29,670
You wanna
talk about it?

763
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:30,907
No.
Good.

764
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:31,971
You left your plant there.

765
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,347
I know.
Wanna go back
and get it?

766
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,476
No.

767
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:38,151
Okay, June 21st is
missing from the logbook?

768
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,382
No, I'll check on
that right away.

769
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,221
Sweet. So, does
Lassiter need any more help?

770
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,386
No, Shawn, he is on fire.

771
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:48,125
He's already had the autopsy
test rerun, and he's contacted
every relative he had.

772
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,325
Is that a personal
call, O'Hara?

773
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,458
Yes.
Wrap it up.

774
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,867
I think I'm onto something.
I think he was killed
by someone he knew.

775
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,427
I gotta go.

776
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:57,599
Bryant Vallery opened
a safety deposit
box account in June.

777
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,867
Was it around June 21st?

778
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,035
What was June 21st?

779
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,308
I don't know.
Didn't you say something
about June 21st yesterday?

780
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:07,374
I've said so many things
in the last few days.
Refresh my memory.

781
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,478
Dude, you look sharp.
Thank you.

782
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,716
I've got one more
thing for you.

783
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,950
What's that?

784
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,355
You want me to wear a wire?

785
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,987
Just this little
baby one.

786
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,632
Look, in the event that
she actually did it, right?

787
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,758
She's not gonna suspect you.

788
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,201
Forget it, Shawn.
I'm gonna sit down with
her for 30 minutes,

789
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,501
ask a few questions
and keep it cool,
just in case.

790
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,135
Just in case she
didn't kill the guy.

791
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,201
All right, here's
a compromise.

792
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:35,506
Let me follow you.
No.

793
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,310
Come on! From a
safe distance. It'll
be like, 30 yards.

794
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,544
Consider me stealth, Shawn.

795
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,048
Hey, be careful.

796
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,687
You know, we have
a mirror in the bathroom.

797
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,595
You seem jumpy.

798
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:55,029
Me? Oh, no.
No, no. I'm excited.

799
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,033
So...

800
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,504
Tell me about
this guy you just
broke up with.

801
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,835
Exes? Ooh!

802
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:06,035
Don't you know the
number one rule of
first dates, Gus?

803
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:09,303
I'm very comfortable
talking about anything.

804
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,243
Well, there's not
much to tell, really.

805
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,339
Mmm-hmm.

806
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,112
About a month in,
I find out he's married.

807
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,209
Right.

808
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,446
Just my luck.

809
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,179
And then he kept calling.

810
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:21,020
He actually thought
I'd be okay with the
whole dirty scenario.

811
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,492
He just...
He wasn't the guy I thought
he was, in a lot of ways.

812
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:25,926
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

813
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,965
Wow, that's...
That's great.

814
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,294
Why?

815
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,701
I don't know.

816
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,463
Hey, I'm sorry about
having to go earlier.

817
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,600
It's just everything
changed at the observatory

818
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:40,576
and I gotta get to work
early tomorrow, so...

819
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:41,634
What's going on?

820
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:44,180
Well, don't tell
anyone, but

821
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,352
Hugo and Bryant may
have discovered a planet.

822
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,977
Get out of here!
Yeah!

823
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,284
An extra-solar planet.

824
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,081
About six months ago, I think.

825
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,819
Bryant kinda clued me in
the night they found it.

826
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,485
He was so excited.

827
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,224
They had to track their
data, wait for the planet
to come around again

828
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,287
and complete its orbit.
Right.

829
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,060
So, it must be verified now.

830
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,568
I mean, you don't
just call a press conference
for nothing, right?

831
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,695
Hugo is over the moon.

832
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,002
Yeah, he's gonna
be famous forever.

833
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,811
Do you have any idea
how huge this is for
someone's career?

834
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,074
Um...
Of course he does.

835
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,645
Shawn?
I was in stealth mode!
How did you find me?

836
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,082
You knew he was
following you?

837
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,176
No, not at all.

838
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,447
Jessica, this is
a good thing.

839
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,216
It means we don't
suspect you anymore.

840
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,257
"We"? Suspect me of what?

841
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:28,883
I didn't think you
killed him, Jessica.
Killed?

842
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,825
And I hope this
doesn't create trust
issues for our future.

843
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,192
We just needed to
establish motive.

844
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,128
Dude, we totally
established motive!

845
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:37,099
Well, congratulations,
Gus, whatever you are.

846
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:40,865
You've got your motive,
whatever that is, but you
no longer have a date.

847
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,530
No.
SHAWN: Jessie!

849
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,038
Jessica, hold on a sec!

850
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:49,973
Gus!

851
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,144
Man, that's twice!

852
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,291
...and to the Santa Barbara
Space Center

853
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,260

their facility.

854
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:08,094
I dedicate this to
my departed comrade,

(ALL CLAMORING)
Professor! Professor!

856
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,630
When was the discovery made?

857
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,430
The 21st of June,

858
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:17,197
9:55 p.m., during a routine
changeover between
my partner and myself.

859
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,140
While readjusting
some coordinates,

860
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,113
I inadvertently made
what is certainly
the discovery of my lifetime.

861
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,749
Which one of you
made the actual discovery?

862
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,308
It was me.
We traded off chairs
every two hours.

863
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:30,445
This was completely
by accident.

864
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,354
WOMAN: What about a book?
Surely you'll have
a lot of book offers.

865
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:34,516
(WHISPERING) Gus, you
know what this means?

866
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,389
It's murder.
It's...

867
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,792
No, it's motive.

868
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,158
That's what I said.

869
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,493
No, you said,
"It's murder."

870
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,363
It's the same thing.
Motive, murder,
it's the same thing.

871
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,696
No, motive is the
reason for doing it.

872
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:45,895
It's in the same
family, Shawn.

(SIGHING) Jeez. Hello.

879
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,646
Shawn, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

880
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,278
Look, Dad, I can't talk
to you about your love life,
okay? I can't do it.

881
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,613
My love life?
You still on that?

882
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,249
I'm talking about this
foxglove you left on my porch.

883
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:08,349
Foxglove?

884
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,122
Your little plant with
the dirty roots. It's all
over my welcome mat.

885
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,288
That was foxglove?
What the hell is foxglove?

886
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,059
<i>Some neighbor's cat</i>
<i>could have wandered in,</i>

887
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,566
chewed on it and croaked
right in my front yard, Shawn.

888
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:20,263
Some foxglove has
a chemical called
digitalis in its leaves.

889
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:21,965
What, is it, like, poison?
It's a medicine!

890
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,473
And you know how I feel
about dead things in my yard.

891
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,702
Look, Dad,
I'm sorry. I gotta go,

892
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,641
I can't have two people
solving my case at once.

893
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,543
Shawn, we should talk.
(SIGHING) Okay, fine.

894
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,377
I'll be at Tom Blair's Pub
on Friday. Come by.

895
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,940
I got a date on Friday.
Can you do Saturday?

896
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,246
Never mind.

897
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,349
Digitalis is prescribed
for heart conditions.

898
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,581
I don't see how
that helps us, Gus.

899
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,090
It can cause toxicity
in someone who doesn't
have a heart problem.

900
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,250
Wouldn't that show up
in the autopsy?

901
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,556
That's the problem.
You have to test
for digitalis specifically.

902
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,223
No one would consider it
if someone doesn't have
a history of heart problems.

903
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,287
Shh!

904
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,125
Hey, what are
you doing here?

905
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,329
We just got our
motive for murder,
Spencer.

906
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:56,703
Hugo found out that Vallery
was gonna take all the credit
for their discovery himself.

907
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,537
Cut him out of it entirely.

908
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,975
Because he was
on the scope when
they made the find?

909
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,740
Yes. Maybe.

910
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,270
What are you doing here?

911
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:05,440
Well, we heard
you had the motive,

912
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,313
so we rushed down here
to volunteer our services.

913
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,909
Thanks, but I'll take
this one myself.

914
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,113
Okay, well at least
tell me about the poison.

915
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,213
What poison? I didn't
say anything about poison.

916
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,622
You most certainly did.
I heard it.

917
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,853
Clear as day.
Must have slipped out.

918
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:20,158
I have been thinking
about poison as a method,
but I can't figure out how.

919
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,597
Would you like me to
read your innermost thoughts?

920
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,897
Like deep, deep, deep ones.

921
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:27,968
Knock yourself out.

922
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,371
Okay, I just
want you to relax.

of getting a warrant.

929
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,713

00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,758

of getting a warrant now.

932
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:50,651
It's buried there?

940
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:08,672
It's Prince after he was
known as "the artist
formerly known as Prince."

941
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,307
It's purple.

Yes! That's it!
You're amazing.

943

Oh, the caverns
of knowledge
in that thing.

944
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,448
Here's the problem.
We ran the toxicology report.

945
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,921
There's no trace of poisoning.

946
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,515
Of course.
Thank you, Detective.

947
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:26,791
So what you're saying is,
he would've had to administer
it very, very slowly.

948
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,355
Yes. That's exactly
what I'm saying.

949
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,563
How do you poison
someone slowly?

950

<i>He brings me coffee.</i>
<i>Although, he brings it</i>
<i>for everybody.</i>

<i>All four of us. Three of us.</i>

952
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,872
Coffee.
No, I'm good.

953
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,073
Tea.
Well, if you're going.

954
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,639
It had to be the tea.
The leaves wouldn't
stand out in the tea.

955
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:47,706
Hugo poisoned his tea.

956
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,252
Every day for six months.

957
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,185
Digitalis would cause
arrhythmia in a healthy heart.

958
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,223
Which would disappear
as soon as someone died.

959
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,484
Solved it!
SHAWN: No, you didn't.

960
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,355
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.

961
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,418
Oh, that's right.
You did.

962
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:02,830

Tell him to check for even the
slightest traces of digitalis.

963
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,970

That she wants you back.

No, no, I don't
think I said that.

977
