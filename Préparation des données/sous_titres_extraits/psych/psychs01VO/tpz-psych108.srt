00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,266
That is,
if instead of lemons,
he's using heroin.

168
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,828
Whatever it is, anything that
pays in stacks of cash
like that can't be legal.

169
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:01,896
Or healthful.

170
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:06,104
It's obvious what happened.
Malone was involved
in some shady dealings.

171
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,875
He's either off on a spending
spree or things got
a little too shady for him.

172
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,007
So, what now?

173
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,278
Find his friends.
Computer camp, please.

174
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,785
Malone's rolling in dough.

175
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,618
Whatever he's doing,
they're with him.
We find them, we find him.

176
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,658
The question is where.

177
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,649
Wait a second.

178
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,692
You don't already know
where he is?

179
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,789
Gus, I'm a professional
gathering information, okay?
I'm getting there.

180
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,993
(CHUCKLES)
You know, Shawn, I...

181
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,036
I just thought you
were a little better
than this.

182
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,331
Just a little.
All right,
what is this?

183
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,168
You know where he is?
Of course I do.

184
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,333
While you're playing
with light switches
and ordering breakfast,

185
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,036
I was investigating a case.

186
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,304
I see.

187
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,341
Okay.

188
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,382
Okay, I'll bite.

189
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,418
Where is he,
Chocolate Columbo?

190
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,881
Tri-Con.

191
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,047
Do what?
Tri-Con.

192
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,556
The Tri-Annual Comic Book
and Science Fiction Convention

193
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,286
is in Santa Barbara
this weekend.

194
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,453
You saw all those comic books
in Malone's room.

195
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,962
You're 18 years old.
You have a ton of cash

196
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,828
burning a hole in your pocket
and you love comics.

197
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,368
Where else would you go
to spend your
disposable income?

198
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,425
Think, Shawn.

199
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,835
Gus, I apologize.
That's brilliant.
Thank you.

200
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,567
Let's verify it
so we can go check it out.

201
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,609
Shawn, I'm sure he's there.
There's no doubt.

202
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:11,700
You're sure?
Yep.

203
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,766
How's that?

204
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,237
(SIGHING)

205
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,554
Are those directions
to the convention center?

206
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,920
I found it
in his wastebasket.

207
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,088
You know,
in case I never said it,

208
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,359
I was really pleased
when you were named as chief.

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,163
Interim chief. I'm sure
that's only temporary.

210
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,225
Mmm-hmm.

211
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,434
It's true that
the outgoing chief
was important to me.

212
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,636
He was my mentor.
Made me the cop I am today.

213
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:46,700
Mmm-hmm.

214
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,580
I know the outside perception
is that the force was
a real boys' club under him,

215
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:56,714
so I thought it was
really smart when they named
a, you know, woman.

216
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,350
All right, honey.

217
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,721
Excuse me, what?
I love you.

218
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,019
Huh?

219
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,586
(CHUCKLING) Okay.

220
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,828
Yeah, I'll just see you
when we get back. Okay.

221
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,904
I'm sorry, Detective,
were you saying something?

222
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,201
No, I wasn't.

223
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,711
We can't just
walk into the con.

224
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,872
I'm sorry, "the con"?

225
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:23,972
Yeah.

226
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,109
You're calling a place
filled with overweight
teenagers

227
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:31,020
battling mild cases
of scoliosis and advanced
bed-wetting "the con"?

228
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,558
We can't get in there.
The tickets were
sold out a month ago.

229
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,026
Did you already try
to get tickets?

230
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,961
Focus, Shawn.
How much were they?

231
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,555
Will you focus?

232
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,733
No, no, no,
leave this out of sight

233
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,135
until we get the issues
resolved with the food
in his room, all right?

234
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,173
I don't know
if he's going to walk over
the blueberry issue,

235
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,300
but we cannot have people
lining up until we're sure
he's participating.

236
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,143
I gotta call his agent.
Get me a list of all the
produce vendors in the area.

237
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,842
We can't risk alienating
the <i>Star Trek</i> fans.

238
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,918
You can't come in
without tickets.

239
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,046
They didn't tell you
we were coming?

240
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,147
Who?

241
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,124
We work for George.

242
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,928
Takai?

243
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,589
You mean Takei?

244
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,466
Yeah. Those closest
to him know exactly how
he likes it pronounced, okay?

245
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,731
You think you can have
a convention without
Commander Chekov?

246
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:20,965
Sulu, jackass.

247
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,803
Have his fresh blueberries
arrived yet?

248
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,105
I don't have record
of receiving them yet.

249
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,945
You don't have record
of having received them yet.

250
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,609
Give me that.

251
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,013
(LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY)

252
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,853
(LAUGHS)
They don't have
the fresh blueberries.

253
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,916
(ALL LAUGHING)

254
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,928
(STAMMERING)
What's the big deal?

255
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,465
What's the big deal?
What is the big deal?

256
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,660
Do you have any idea
what happened when they
forgot his blueberries

257
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,293
at the con in San Antonio?

258
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,099
That comb-over
will be the least of your...

259
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,907
You know what,
it's better.

260
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,009
It's better
if you don't know.

261
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,444
It's how I ended up
with a stutter
and a wooden pinky toe.

262
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,415
Now for the love of Scotty...
Still Sulu.

263
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,474
(STUTTERING) Would you...

264
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:12,016
Please, let me get in there
and save all of our asses?

265
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,533
Dude, some guy
in a wolf costume

266
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,373
with a light saber
just said hi to you.

267
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,878
I don't know that guy.

268
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,414
He looked right at you.

269
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,847
He was mistaken.

270
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,851
He said, "Hi, Gus."

271
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:44,146
And then another dude
with a cape and a codpiece
gave you a half-nod.

272
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,418
I don't know any of
these people, Shawn, okay?
Uh-huh.

273
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,153
Hey, guys.
I'm Talia. This is Dent.

274
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,660
We're from Parastone Pictures

275
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,390
and just wanted to remind you
to go see the world premiere

276
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,261
of the <i>Red Phantom</i>
trailer tomorrow night.

277
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,824
It'll be the biggest movie
of the summer.
Do not miss out.

278
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,234
No way,
I love the dead phantom.

279
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,162
Red Phantom.

280
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,439
What, he didn't die
at the end?

281
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,972
Bye.
Bye.

282
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,605
I hear this movie's
going to bomb.

283
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,774
<i>MAN ON PA:</i>
<i>Check one. Check two.</i>

284
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,580
Too bad. I kind of dug
the Red Phantom.

285
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,787
You haven't even seen
the trailer, you already
hate it, how's that possible?

286
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,790
<i>Fortress of Attitude.</i>

287
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,292
What did you just say to me?
<i>Fortress of Attitude.</i>

288
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,624
It's this site
that reviews movies
based on comic books.

289
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,391
The Malcontent,
the guy who runs it,

290
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:28,262
says he already saw
a 30-minute presentation
here at the convention.

291
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,824
He blazed it online.

292
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,803
Can't you just look at porn
on the net like every
other guy and his brother?

293
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,896
Everybody reads this blog.

294
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,032
No. Not everybody.

295
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,905
Everybody here does, Shawn.

296
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,342
And you know what?
I don't care what you think.

297
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,243
So why don't you let me
do the talking here
at the convention,

298
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,645
and try not
to embarrass me.

299
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,685
This is my turf.
And yes, I know the guy
in the codpiece.

300
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,549
His name is Dave.

301
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,714
And he's a very nice guy.

302
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,187
Snap.

303
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,295
Two for 50 cents.

304
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,761
What?
That's Hiltz Kooler.

305
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,772
Excuse me, Mr. Kooler?

306
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,605
I'm a huge Green Spirit fan.

307
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,042
He's my favorite,
actually.

308
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,170
I was wondering,

309
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,271
would you mind signing
my original copy

310
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,940
of <i>The Green Spirit</i>
<i>Strikes Again?</i>

311
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,417
Whoa. Haven't seen
one of these in a while.

312
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,249
I couldn't believe
I found a guy selling one.

313
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,983
I love how this story
reinvented the character
for today.

314
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,388
Well, there you go.

315
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,323
Enjoy.
It's one of my favorites.

316
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,760
You know, I wish
they'd based the movie
on this story arc.

317
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,956
What am I gonna do?
I told them
about a million times.

318
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,023
They don't listen to me.
Still a huge fan.

319
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,796
Well, I'm glad someone is
after that Green Spirit movie.

320
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,100
Wait, wait, wait.
Is this the movie
you dragged me to

321
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,369
where the hero
had big nipples
on the outside of his costume?

322
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,534
Damn those nipples.

323
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,511
(LAUGHING)
They were like big
angry marshmallows.

324
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,876
Be nice to him, Shawn.

325
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,939
The Green Spirit movie
nearly killed the character.

326
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,450
Gus, all I care about
is finding our guys.

327
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,646
I can't take
much more of this.

328
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:00,623
There's too much real estate.
We can't cover it all at once.

329
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,955
Maybe we should split up.

330
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,086
I can help our situation.

331
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:09,328
<i>So, next on our list...</i>

332
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:11,866
<i>Sir, can I help you?</i>

333
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:15,532
Yeah, I'm Shawn Spencer,
psychic, SBPD.

Did he bash anything
in particular?

The <i>Red Phantom</i> movie.
He's relentless.

454
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,967
It's weird, because
if you go back a little,

455
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,101
he was originally saying
great things about it.

456
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:56,511
So Parastone Pictures
paid him to praise
the <i>Red Phantom</i> flick.

457
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,412
That must be
where all the money
from his room came from.

00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,108

helped either, Gus.

done anything to prevent

But Malone blazed

why he's missing.

00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:38,608
but it really doesn't make
any sense to have
so many officers

503
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,480
working the daytime shift
at Grab.

504
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,577
Detective.
Since most car thefts
occur at night.

505
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,849
Now, if you were
to split the shift,
go with me on this...

506
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,390
Carlton!
What?

507
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,255
My water just broke.

508
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,818
Are you sure?

509
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:53,058
No, Carlton, there's water
spilling out of me
for some other reason.

510
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,157
Oh, no. Oh, can you
move my briefcase?

511
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,065
Your briefcase?
It might be
in the line of the...

512
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,195
Do you understand
how uncomfortable this is?

513
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,365
It's leather.
I didn't Scotchguard it!

514
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,137
You know what, never mind.

515
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,502
Just has tremendous
sentimental value.

516
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,070
Just take me to
the nearest hospital.
All right?

517
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:14,045
Oh, I don't think
we need that.
Oh, I think we do.

518
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:18,679
Do you know what?
We'll use the siren, too.
For you. Just in case.

519
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,348
(SIREN WAILING)

520
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,492
Hey, guys.
Hey.

521
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,466
Can't stop to talk.
Got to sign autographs.

522
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,999
Look, dude, I got a date
with that Talia girl from
the studio in, like, an hour.

523
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,130
A nice romantic walk
on the beach to Jim's.

524
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,834
Best scungilli in
Santa Barbara.

525
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,398
Why couldn't you
just talk to her now?

526
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,843
Because, Gus, happy hour
doesn't start until 5:00.

527
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,311
You're supposed
to be figuring out
if she's innocent.

528
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,041
That's exactly
what I plan to do.

529
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,478
Shawn.
GT.

530
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,451
The blueberries
are still wrong.

531
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,924
I requested North Carolina
blueberries, but they sent me
Michigan blueberries.

532
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,723
People say I'm crazy,
but I can taste
the difference.

533
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,093
I don't think
that's crazy at all.

534
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:04,158
And I requested that
my green room not be
at the end of the hall.

535
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,863
I have to be in the middle.
It's affecting my chi.

536
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,634
Gus.
What?

537
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,767
Did you skimp out and get
the Michigan blueberries?

538
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,470
What?
And screw up
the room location?

539
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,705
And what are you doing
to George's chi?

540
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,077
Are you touching it
and whatnot? Stop it.

541
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,775
This is my fault,
Mr. Takei.

542
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,579
My fault for farming out
responsibilities

543
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,517
that I should have
seen to personally.

544
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:23,679
My humblest apologies.

545
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,620
We'll get you
the right blueberries
as soon as possible

546
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,158
and a better room assignment.
You have my word.

547
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,285
Well, all right, then.

548
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,725
Good help is hard to find,
I suppose.

549
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,996
Why did you blame
that on me?

550
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,297
Dude, we needed
a fall guy.

551
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,862
I can't be the fall guy
in front of one
of my heroes, Shawn.

552
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,670
Okay, then you and I
need to create a third
imaginary assistant

553
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,176
that's completely
incompetent.

554
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,508
I think her name
should be Beatrice.

555
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,241
What say you?

556
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:55,009
All right, yeah,
just send it to my assistant.

557
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,948
It's tremendous.

558
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,120
You don't mind it, though.
You don't mind all
the comic book stuff?

559
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:03,251
It's fun, harmless,
a little wish fulfillment.

560
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,294
Oh, come on,
you didn't pretend
to fly around like Superman

561
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,127
when you were a kid?

562
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,570
So, uh, pretty high stakes
on the <i>Red Phantom</i> movie, huh?

563
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:15,936
We, uh, took a bath
a couple of years ago on
this other comic book movie,

564
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,038
<i>The Adventures</i>
<i>of the Green Spirit.</i>

565
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,440
Yeah, the nipple flick.

566
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,173
God, is that all anyone
remembers about that movie?
Yes.

567
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:26,013
Ugh, we had to
build a landfill
for the unsold action figures.

568
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,018
So, we're pulling out
all the stops

569
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,418
to launch the trailer
for the <i>Red Phantom</i> movie.

570
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,456
You know, lasers, music.

571
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,891
Dent even organized this
whole pyrotechnics display.

572
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:39,328
Word of mouth is the first
and most vital step
in this world.

573
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,388
Vital enough
to pay somebody off?

574
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,490
What?

575
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,161
Hmm? Let's say
there's a blogger,
right?

576
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,500
And he's wielding
way more power
than he should.

577
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,130
And he can be had
for a price.

578
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,471
You guys would be fools
not to take a shot, right?

579
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,635
Who are you, Shawn?

580
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,838
I'm a psychic.
I work with the police.

581
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,744
I'm investigating
a disappearance.

582
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,807
Malone Breyfogle.
The Malcontent.

583
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,709
I'm sensing you probably
know a lot about him.

584
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,448
Okay, this conversation
is over.

585
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,149
No. It's just starting
to get good.

586
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,784
See, he reneged on a promise
and now he's missing.

587
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,088
Missing?

588
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:14,491
Look, whether or not this guy
had a consultation fee
is besides the point.

589
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,557
We don't harm people.
It's just a movie.

590
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,398
Just a movie?

591
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,737
You think your boss
will tell me the same thing?

592
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,830
I don't know.
Why don't we go
ask him together?

593
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,966
Dent is back at our
convention headquarters.

594
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:28,376
Fine.
So, no scungilli, then?

595
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,612
I didn't expect you
to be so cooperative,

596
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,913
so if I seemed
a little pushy...

597
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,453
Accusing me of kidnapping?

598
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,148
I accused you of bribery.

599
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,521
I implied you may have
had something to do
with the kidnapping.

600
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,786
There's a difference.

601
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,691
You know, a lot of couples
start off on the wrong foot.

602
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,229
It just means we have
nowhere to go but up.

603
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,527
Well, when you're done here
with Dent, we're done.

604
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,230
What the...

605
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:55,500
Oh, my God.
What happened here?
Where is he?

606
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:02,001
Some seriously
dark juju magumbo
went down in here.

607
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,351
"Two down, one to go."

608
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,152
Okay, good news,
your boss is innocent.

609
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:16,225
Bad news, he just became
a face on a milk carton.

610
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,430
I checked Malone's blog
again today.

611
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,697
There are more entries
blazing the <i>Red Phantom</i> movie.

612
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:29,035
I think Malone was kidnapped
before the blogs showed up.

613
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,268
He was probably going to honor
his deal with Parastone.

614
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,334
So, the kidnapper
is the one roasting this
new movie online?

615
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,176
He also wrote,
"The guilty will pay."

616
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:38,815
The guilty will pay?

617
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,180
Yep.
Wow.

618
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,742
One of these comic book freaks
has clearly blurred the line

619
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,914
between reality and

620
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:47,847
comic book.

621
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,260
The kidnapper still has
one more person to snatch.

622
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:54,059
And it appears he's targeting
anyone involved
in this bribery scam.

623
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,965
(CELLULAR PHONE RINGING)
Talia. Talia has to be
the next victim.

624
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,525
We need to get
the real police in here.

625
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,970
Hello?
Uh, hello, Mr. Takei,
what can I do for you?

626
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,597
Just name it.

627
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,834
Hold on.
It's for you.

628
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:11,880
G-Dog. What's up, handsome?
Beatrice?

629
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,781
I canned her.
Yeah, she's out of here.

630
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:19,687
Tonight? Absolutely, sir.
I'll meet you there.

631
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,450
Huh.
What? What's happening?

632
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,892
Karaoke with George later.

633
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,395
Get out of here.

634
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,488
This is a <i>Trek</i> fan's
dream come true.

635
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,328
Hmm. Awkward.

636
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,527
What?
He sort of just invited me.

637
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,729
You know what?
Call him back,

638
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:37,639
tell him I said we need you
for all the high harmonies.

639
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,142
This is messed up, Shawn.

640
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,802
No, this is messed up.

641
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:44,246
This isn't a churro.
This is...
I don't know what this is.

642
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:48,880
Okay, finally got a hold
of your husband.

643
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,421
He's on his way,
but apparently
traffic is a nightmare.

644
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,478
Thank you, Carlton.

645
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,548
Everything's looking
really good.

646
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,355
You just relax.

647
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,592
I'm going to go now
and let you...

648
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:02,565
No, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't... Don't go.

649
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,397
You want me to stay?

650
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,131
Yeah. In class,
I always had a coach.

651
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:11,134
So, just stand here
and keep your eyes
north of the equator.

652
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,403
Yeah, that won't be a problem.

653
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,274
You ready
for your epidural?

654
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:17,212
No, thank you.
I'm going to do
this naturally.

655
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,807
Okay. We'll hold off, then.
Mmm-hmm.

656
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,852
Are you insane?
I don't need it.

657
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,081
Listen, I would put myself
on a morphine pump

658
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,248
if I were going to push
eleven pounds of limbs
and elbows out of...

659
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,258
I've made my decision.

660
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,319
And I admire you for it.

661
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,456
Have you considered this?
Maybe the whole thing
is a stunt.

662
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,023
What do you mean?
You know,
to promote the movie.

663
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,331
The whole scenario
is just so fantastical.

664
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,372
It's like a plot
to a comic book.

665
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,997
Dent could have arranged it,
maybe Talia.

666
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,098
It could have been
all three of them.

667
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,235
It's just so theatrical
with the cryptic notes.

668
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,779
Shawn?
Hi.

669
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,407
Hi. Gus said
you've seen the kidnapper.

670
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,074
You told her that?
We needed her.

671
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,379
Can you give me
a description?

672
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,717
You can't tell her
I've seen the kidnapper when
I didn't see the kidnapper.

673
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,950
I didn't see the kidnapper.
You didn't?

674
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,960
I saw through
the kidnapper's eyes.

675
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,554
He was stalking
his next victim.
It was a woman.

676
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,060
Shawn.

677
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,072
Talia. It's Talia.

678
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:20,599
Wait. The woman you discovered
the second note with
is the third victim?

679
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:23,545
Quite possibly.
Or she could be the kidnapper.

680
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:24,673
So, what,
she's kidnapping herself?

681
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,011
Or the second victim
is the kidnapper

682
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,449
and he was just pretending
to get kidnapped.

683
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,645
Guys, I just saw her.
She's outside on the phone.

684
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,052
Man.

685
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,957
Where did you see her last?
Over there.

686
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,428
Oh, man.

687
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,127
"9-1..." Uh-oh.

688
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,160
GUS:
What? No note?

689
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:49,197
SHAWN:
Wait a minute.

690
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,476
Excuse me.

691
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,715
Thank you.

692
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,211
"Judgment day."

693
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:09,257
Looks like Talia's
joined Malone and Dent
in missing-persons land.

694
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,668
Judgment day?
It sounds bad.

695
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,270
That's, like, the day
that you're judged.

696
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,399
In <i>T2</i> it was
the end of mankind.

697
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:27,034
Though I doubt our kidnapper
has first-strike
nuclear capabilities.

698
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,442
Ooh!

699
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,574
What the hell
are you doing?

700
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,642
Running makes me hungry.
You know that.

701
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,982
You don't know
where those have been.

702
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,613
They could have bird flu
on them or something.

703
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,658
Bird flu. Wow.
Look at you.

704
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,750
How can you read a comic book
at a time like this?

705
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,522
First of all,
I can read a comic anytime.

706
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:47,462
And secondly,
Juliet has almost the entire
police force inside there.

707
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:48,556
They'll find Talia
and the others.

708
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,124
Dude, whatever
this crazy person has planned
for these people,

709
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:52,499
he's going to do it soon.

710
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,470
He has all his victims.

711
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,063
We need to figure out
who stands to gain

712
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,573
from the disappearance
of those three

713
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,509
and who would want
the <i>Red Phantom</i> movie
to tank this badly.

714
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,205
Why don't you ask your friend,
George Takei?

715
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,406
I would.

716
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,780
But once he starts
singing <i>Afternoon Delight,</i>
he just goes to another place.

717
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,182
Shawn?

718
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,413
Juliet didn't find anything
at the latest crime scene
to help?

719
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,819
Shawn?
No forensics on the note?

720
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:12,913
Shawn?
What?

721
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,051
Look. It's the same
as the note in Malone's room.

722
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,890
Somebody's recreating
the crime from
this comic book.

723
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,395
What happens
in this thing?

724
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,954
A supervillain named
Fear Career,

725
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,932
he kidnaps the judge,
prosecutor
and defense attorney

726
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,195
he felt
locked him up years ago.

727
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,668
Fear Career. Awesome.
Then what?

728
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,299
He sets them on fire.

729
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,568
He sets them on fire?
Yeah.

730
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:31,938
Give me that.
What the hell are you doing?

731
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,999
Looking for clues.

732
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,068
You're ruining
a first printing
near-mint work of art.

733
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,738
I've been looking
for that comic
for five years now.

734
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:39,009
Gus, lives are at stake.

735
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,445
The kidnapper must be
some kind of deranged fan.

736
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:47,354
Deranged? Yes. Fan?

737
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,058
I'm not so sure.

motivate her a little bit?

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Motivation was my thing
at the academy.

744
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,738
All right,
now you listen to me,

745
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:09,871
it's time to squeeze
this puppy out.

746
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,676
So, when I say push,
I want you to push,
you understand me?

747
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:14,445
Push! Push! Push!

748

working for me right now!

giving it a shot!

I don't need that either.

what you want then.

I don't know
what any woman wants.

756
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,800
Just give me your hand
and shut the hell up.

Nice to meet you.

767

Children are
one of the reasons
my wife and I split up.

768

She didn't think
I wanted any.

769

She was wrong.

770

Yeah, that's great, Carlton.

Of course.

in this place.

They're near fire.

833
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,674
Dent even organized this whole
pyrotechnics display.

834
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,949
Under the stage.

835
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,091
Oh, down here.

836
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,168
They're here. All of them.

837
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,408
Look, don't worry,
everything's going to be
just fine, okay?

838
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,569
We're going to
get you out of here.

839
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:41,804
Guys.

840
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:49,714
Hi. Hi.

841
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,982
So, after I collared
the villain
and saved the girl,

842
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,148
Jules grabbed the others

843
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,782
and everyone hoisted me
on their shoulders,

844
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,690
carried me to the car
chanting my name.

845
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,194
It was awesome.

846
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:01,231
Oh, but your story
about cutting the cord
was good, too.

847
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:06,065
Lot of drama, suspense,
twist ending that I don't
think any of us saw coming.

848
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,502
At which point
did you faint?

849
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,163
I did not faint.

850
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,403
I was merely
resting my eyes momentarily
and fell slightly backwards.

851
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:16,606
Hey, I don't know
if it makes a difference.
I think you're a hero.

852
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,543
Which one is hers?

853
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,743
I don't know.
Lassiter, you cut the cord.

854
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:24,151
Well, they all look alike.
Is there one that poops a lot?

855
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:26,712
I know.
Let's ask our psychic.

856
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,693
You know what, guys,
this is weird,
I'm not getting anything.

857
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:34,925
I think one of these babies
might be evil, blocking
my abilities to communicate.

858
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,159
Damien?

859
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:40,067
Come on. Isn't it obvious?
She looks exactly like me.

860
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:41,962
Hi.

861
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,506
Chief, should you be up
and walking?

862
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,508
Walking?
I'm coming into work tomorrow.

863
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:49,637
No, don't be ridiculous.
You need to go home
with your child. Relax.

864
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,738
Take a load off.
Refresh yourself.

865
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,785
January, I think January.
Come back in January.

866
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,399
So glad you both
could make it.

867
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,265
Make it? I live here.

868
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,037
What's that behind your back,
Shawn?

869
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,197
I dropped back by the con.
You went back without me?

870
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,900
Those people, good people,
good hearts.

871
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,943
You were right
from the beginning, Gus.

872
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,240
And I didn't want
to ruin the surprise.

873
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,111
Introducing,
Tranya Independent Comics'

874
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,810
latest limited-edition
one-shot...

875
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,880
Surprise.

876
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,719
"Follow
the adventures of Psych-Man

877
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:37,124
"as he uses
his bizarre mental powers
to foil criminal plots

878
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:38,661
"with his sidekick
Magic Head."

879
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:42,665
And bam!

880
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,989
(HENRY SNICKERS)

881
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,127
What's that supposed to be?

882
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:51,663
Dude, it's Magic Head!
It's like looking in a mirror.

883
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,843
Why would I need a wand
when I have a magic head?

884
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:59,042
It's a ceremonial thing.
It's, it's just...
It's representative.

885
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,777
You don't actually
use the wand.

886
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,284
Stupid.

887
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,344
I think it's dope.

888
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:07,185
Now, who wants an autograph?

889
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:21,427
<i>In between the lines</i>
<i>there's a lot of obscurity</i>

890
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,766
<i>I'm not inclined</i>
<i>to resign to maturity</i>

891
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:28,169
<i>If it's all right</i>
<i>then you're all wrong</i>

892
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:31,703
<i>But why bounce around</i>
<i>to the same damn song?</i>

893
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:36,979
<i>You'd rather run</i>
<i>when you can't crawl</i>

894
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,689
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>That I'm not telling the truth</i>

895
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,885
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>They just don't have any proof</i>

896
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:49,091
<i>Embrace the deception</i>
<i>Learn how to bend</i>

897
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,327
<i>Your worst inhibitions</i>

898

899
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,432
<i>I know, you know</i>
