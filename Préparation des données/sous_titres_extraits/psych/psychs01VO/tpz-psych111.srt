1
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,174
Shawn! Stop.

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:17,108
Turn around.

3
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,177
Turn around.

4
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,719
What are you hiding?

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,451
Did you get in a fight,
Shawn?
Kind of.

6
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,621
Kind of?
What do you mean, kind of?

7
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,097
What did I tell you
about fighting?
Get over here, son.

8
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,467
Take a look at that.

9
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:42,369
You really got punched.
Here, hold that on your eye.

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,106
All right, tell me,
what's the name of
this kid who hit you?

11
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,305
Elizabeth.

12
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,812
You got in a fight
with a girl?

13
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,077
Well,
it wasn't really a fight.

14
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,175
She just punched me.

15
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,810
Why in the world
would she punch you?

16
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,252
What happened?

17
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,846
She asked me
to sit next to her
at lunch and I did.

18
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,617
And then I was eating
my Tater Tots
and she just punched me.

19
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,854
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

20
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,657
What was she doing
while you were eating
your Tater Tots?

21
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,928
I don't know.
She was talking
about something.

22
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,299
What?
What was she talking about?

23
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,395
I have no idea.
She just went on and on

24
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,498
and I was concentrating
on my Tater Tots.

25
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,335
I'll be damned.

26
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:20,470
Shawn, I know what happened.
You just had your first date.

27
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,174
Sit. Sit.

28
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,607
My first what?

29
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,743
Look, obviously this
Elizabeth girl likes you.

30
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,946
That's why
she invited you
over to sit next to her.

31
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,580
Then why'd she sock me
in the eye?

32
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,217
Because she likes you
and you didn't listen
to her story.

33
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,090
Women want you
to listen to them, Shawn.

34
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,890
They want you to pick up
every small detail,

35
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,328
they want you
to compliment them.

36
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,888
It's about tuning in
to people.

37
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:43,231
It's about
getting inside their heads
and anticipating their needs.

38
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,895
And this applies
to all aspects of life.

39
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,031
Not only
this girl Elizabeth,
but even your barber.

40
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,735
But I don't want
to date the barber.

41
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,401
Shawn,
I know that one day

42
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,275
all of this is going
to make sense to you.

43
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,813
You just have to believe me.

44
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:58,640
For now,
I'm going to leave you
with one very simple rule.

45
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,081
Under no circumstances ever,

46
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:06,650
ever do you
mention to a woman
her age or her weight.

47
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,421
SHAWN: Nobody breathe.
I've got it.

48
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,520
I've got it in grams
and I've got it in minutes.

49
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,191
Just give me a second here.
Do a little converting.

50
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,168
I got it.

51
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,701
37 years old. 127 pounds.

52
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,209
That was amazing.
How did you do that?

53
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,410
I have to admit though, sadly,
it's just a teensy bit higher
in the weight department.

54
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,044
Oh, you know what?
That's my bad.

55
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,851
I believe I was getting
a future reading
from next week.

56
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,585
It happens. I apologize.

57
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,184
Wait. I'm also getting
a dance belt.

58
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,629
You are my head detective.
And fishnet stockings.

59
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,996
But that's this guy.
That's this guy here.

60
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,362
Shawn. Shawn.
I'm kidding.

61
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,767
You're such a good sport.
Everybody loves you.

62
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,329
Hey, Spencer.
Lassy face.

63
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,777
Got the perfect case
for you guys.

64
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,037
I'm sorry.
You're saying that
you want our help?

65
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,240
Yeah.
What's the catch?

66
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,011
There's no catch.
It's just right up your alley.

67
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,075
We could really use
your insights on this one.

68
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,348
The guy's waiting
to give you a statement.
Interrogation room B.

69
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,323
Make me proud.

70
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,686
Okay.
What does that
sound like to you?

71
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,058
An opportunity.

72
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,824
No.

73
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,959
You think Lassiter's going
to just hand us over a case?

74
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,663
Stop. Let's think
about this for a minute.

75
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,102
Gus, come on.
What?

76
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,868
We're going to roll up
our sleeves, we're going
to get a little bit dirty

77
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,035
and we're going to do some
old-fashioned police work.

78
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,010
Come on. This is like
<i>In the Heat of the Night.</i>

79
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,774
Which makes me
Carroll O'Connor.

80
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,337
No. That means
you're Rod Steiger.

81
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,883
That way, I'm Sidney Poitier.

82
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,077
You know that's right.

83
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:41,950
Oh, boy.

84
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,212
Wow.

85
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,018
<i>SHAWN:</i>
<i>Looks like somebody beat us</i>
<i>to the rolling of the sleeves.</i>

86
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,219
No.
What are you doing?

87
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,488
What?

88
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,794
This is our case.
He's naked.

89
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,093
We got to work the room.

90
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,191
I'm gonna work it
from the outside.

91
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,168
You're gonna work it
from in here.
Now shut the door.

92
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,969
Mr. Turk, is it?

93
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,907
My name's Shawn Spencer.

94
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,779
I'm the head P for the SBPD.

95
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,516
You're the who for the what?

96
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,315
Don't concern yourself
with the formalities,
Mr. Turk.

97
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,514
I'm here to take
your statement and find out

98
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,147
just what exactly
happened to you.

99
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,555
Well,
I don't really remember much.

100
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:20,650
Funny.

101
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,592
It says here you told
the desk sergeant,

102
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,596
you woke up naked
in a field with
your ass hanging out.

103
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,959
Yeah, that's right.

104
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,830
But I don't remember
exactly what they look like.

105
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,926
You know,
it's all really
confusing for me right now.

106
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,167
When you say "they,"
just who are you referring to?

107
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,105
The aliens.

108
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,737
See?

109
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,177
Right, aliens.

110
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,346
Here it is.
Page two, got it.

111
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,185
How would you describe
these aliens, Mr. Turk?

112
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,782
Would you say they were small?
Would you say they were green?

113
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,124
You know, I don't really
recall right now.

114
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,753
I've got this headache and...

115
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,661
Who is that person over there?

116
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,290
Because he's really
making me uncomfortable.

117
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,301
I'm making you uncomfortable
right now?

118
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,530
Dude, is there any reason
why you're not wearing
any clothes now?

119
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,664
Hey, I think I might
have been abducted,
all right?

120
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,503
I believe I might
have been experimented on.

121
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,564
So there's no way
I'm going to touch

122
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,701
these clothes
and compromise evidence.

123
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,439
Okay, okay, Mr. Turk.

124
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,811
Please try to gain control
of your considerable person.

125
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,373
Why don't you cover up
with a towel?
That's why it's there.

126
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,817
One size fits all, I hope.

127
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:28,592
All right.
I'll cover up with
the towel, but first...

128
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,362
Does somebody want
to check me for scars?

129
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,723
Oh, good Lord.

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,131

Are you really willing
to just dismiss the idea

136
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,055
that there's life
on other planets?

137
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,529
This is what I got.
I know he was dragged
out there.

138
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,566
Otherwise, no sign of assault.
Nothing taken.

139
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,828
Aside from the embarrassment
of waking up naked in a field,

140
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,836
we've got nothing
to hang our hats on.

141
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,233
I guess technically
we could have hung
our hats on his...

142
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,434
Shawn.
Sorry.

143
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,001
Look, if it's not
the alien thing,

144
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,909
then how do you explain
the memory loss,

145
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,914
the confusion,
the fact that he saw
a little green man?

146
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,381
Hallucinations.
No.

147
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,145
What? Dude,
you're the expert here.

148
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,743
Come on, man,
there's got to be some drug

149
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,015
that would
cause a combination
of those three things.

150
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,613
Think. Drugs.

151
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,786
Oh, you're asking me?
Sure.

152
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:36,617
Let me see.

153
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,130
Off the top of my head,

154
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,291
any SSRIs, Tramadol,

155
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,200
Bupropion,
proton pump inhibitors.

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,965
That's what I'm talking about.
Thank you.

157
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,972

00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,448
Did I already say Venlafaxine?

00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,543
There's no way to be sure.

165
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,577
Wait, wait a second.

166
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,590
Didn't he say
something to you
about smelling lavender?

167
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,125
Yeah.
He said right
before he blacked out,

168
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,989
he remembered
the strong scent of lavender

169
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,789
and seeing barbed wire.

170
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,558
Right.
Wait a second.

00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,731
Gus, that's not
a hallucination.

172
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,859
That's a location.

173
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,130
That's what I'm saying!
And I know
exactly where it is.

174
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,300
SHAWN: Dude,
I've driven by this
place at least twice.

175
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,363
(SIREN WAILING)

176
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,774
The question is,
what are the cops doing here?

177
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,342
<i>OFFICER ON RADIO:</i>
<i>... body of another</i>
<i>male Caucasian, early 30s,</i>

178
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,712
<i>possible 314.</i>
<i>Officers on scene.</i>

179
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:32,978
Johnny.

180
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,342
Oh.

181
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:37,812
Oh.

182
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,036
Look,
I saw the picture of
that Turk guy in the paper.

183
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,008
Now, it's me in a field
naked, headache.

184
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,101
You do the math.

185
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,112
Do you remember seeing
anything out of the ordinary?

186
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,649
I don't remember much at all.

187
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,810
So, you just woke up in
a field wearing nothing but
your birthday suit?

188
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,285
KEISER: Look,
I told you yes already.

189
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,685
Are you going to
give me a hard time?

190
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:10,744
'Cause I'm a little
freaked out as it is.

191
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,552
And can somebody
get me a bigger towel?

192
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,490
This thing is like the size
of a washcloth.

193
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,490
What are you,
some kind of pervert?

194
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,621
Cut him some slack.
He's just doing his job.

195
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,995
You think
he gets his jollies

196
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,533
taking pictures
of your ding dong?

197
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,296
SHAWN: Lassy.

198
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,427
What are you guys
doing here?

199
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,097
This is my case.
You gave it to me, remember?

200
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,437
Look, this is a copycat,
okay?

201
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,670
He saw Turk's
picture in the paper.
He's looking for attention.

202
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,769
So, he wakes up and sees
Turk in the paper naked,

203
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,780
humiliated,
the butt of jokes
at the water cooler

204
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,782
and says,
"Hmm, how can I make
this work for myself?"

205
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,874
What?

206
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,179
Plus,
it's really itchy out here.

207
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,517
When you get your master's
degree in criminology,

208
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,885
then you can call me.

209
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,686
In the meantime,
I got a half-eaten
Enchirito in my car.

210
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:52,755
All right, here we go.
You're up.

211
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:53,856
What?
Do it.

212
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,491
I'm not doing that.
Dude.

213
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,058
I took the fat guy
in the police station.

214
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,125
I'm not doing that.

215
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,671
This is a much better pull.
I'm not doing that, Shawn.

216
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,536
We're partners. Gus.

217
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,877
What does this case have
to do with a tanning salon?

218
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,314
It's the middle
of winter in Santa Barbara.

219
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,545
Those dudes looked like
gingerbread men without
tan lines.

220
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,280
They fake and they bake.

221
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,049
Shawn, exactly
how close did you
look at these naked guys?

222
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,317
Too close.

223
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,392
My heightened
observational skills are
considered a gift by most,

224
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,052
but I'm here to tell you,
it can be a burden.

225
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,858
How do you know
it's this place?

226
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,428
Keiser didn't have any
streaks on his buttocks,
okay?

227
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,160
That screams
the Insta-Tan process

228
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,704
and this is
the only place
that does that.

229
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,034
Right.

230
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,802
Plus, they both
live within a mile
and a half of this joint.

231
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:38,901
Uh-huh.

232
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,148
I can't ring this.
Hello? Hello?

233
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,709
Look, I'm going to
snoop around, okay?

234
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,848
You find out if Turk
or Keiser were here.
And if so, when?

235
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,984
Oh, Shawn, Shawn.
This is not going to work.

236
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,528
Dude,
I've got to do my thing.

237
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,188
I've got to
mix it up nice.
But...

238
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,629
You always complain
you don't get to do
the questiony part.

239
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,491
Questiony part. Gus.

240
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,536
Right.
You're forgetting...

241
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,763
May I help you?

242
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,335
Yes. I'm here for
a tanning appointment.

243
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,373
For yourself?

244
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,575
Yes, for the
Insta-Tan process.
I would like that.

245
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,706
But...

246
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,418
What?
You...

247
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,475
Yes.

248
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,583
I don't understand.

249
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,915
Okay, look, screw it.
I can't do it.

250
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,823
Have you seen
either of these
two guys here before?

251
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,588
Fred Turk or Philip Keiser?

252
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,797
Shawn. Shawn.

253
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,625
Okay,
both Turk and Keiser
not only have been here,

254
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,725
but they're regulars.

255
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,202
He says, it's always
the single guys who try
to keep up with their tans.

256
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,568
Single guys?
Yeah.

257
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,629
Maybe that's it.

258
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,073
Maybe some
woman is targeting
singles at the salon.

259
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,976
The question is,
what kind of loser thinks

260
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,377
getting a tan is going to
help him score a woman?

261
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,043
Dad?

262
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,748
Dad, what are you doing here?

263
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,486
The real question is,
what are you doing here?

264
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,824
Well,
George Hamilton,
we're on a case.

265
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:07,423
Or maybe you missed
the pictures of the guys
in the paper in the field.

266
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,400
Yes, of course I saw it.
The nudist guy in the field,

267
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,436
thinks he was abducted
by aliens.

268
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,597
Idiot.
What does that have
to do with this place?

269
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,231
Well,
they're both regulars here.

270
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,501
They both
happen to be single,

271
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,065
so this could be
a stalking case.

272
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,169
Wait a second,
your dad is single and
he comes here all the time.

273
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,713
HENRY: Everybody comes here.

274
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,248
What is that?
What?

275
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,811
Exfoliating scrub with pumice.

276
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:29,912
Whatever, Shawn.
All I know is,

277
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,150
when I varnish my boat
and I don't want it to streak,

278
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,522
I sand off a layer first.
Same thing goes with tanning.

279
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,618
That is the single
most disturbing analogy

280
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,288
I've ever heard
in my entire life.

281
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,661
Where are they?
Who?

282
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,757
The <i>Queer Eye</i> guys.
I know they're here somewhere.

283
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:42,892
Gus, what are their names?

284
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,458
How am I supposed to know,
Shawn?

285
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,062
Carson and Jai and
the guy with the glasses.

286
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,573
Oh, yeah,
who cooks the fish.
Right.

287
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,009
Shawn, you know what
your real problem is?

288
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,479
You got yourself another case

289
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,072
and, as usual,
you're short sighted.

290
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,343
You think
it's all impressive

291
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,907
'cause you see a couple of
nude guys in a field.

292
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,009
You put a fix on them here.

293
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,111
Well, it's not enough.

294
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,177
This is what we know.

295
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,223
Both these guys are trying
to impress someone,

296
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,451
which means
a woman was involved

297
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,426
and that same woman
was with them in the field.

298
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,360
Shawn saw a woman's
shoe strap in the field.

299
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:15,423
How or why
she connects to them,
I just don't know yet.

300
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,199
Well, you're not
looking close enough.

301
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:23,764
Believe me,
I've looked just about
as close as I can bear.

302
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,575
I'm with you
on the aliens thing.

303
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:31,343
They're here
and they swapped out
my father with José Eber.

304
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,679
I think
your dad might be right.

305
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,617
I think we should get Turk
and Keiser in the same room

306
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,847
and actually ask them
some questions.

307
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,979
Fine. Let's do it.

308
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,889
The rule is, all slacks,
all the time, no exceptions.

309
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,427
I hear that. I've reached my
naked man quota for the year.

310
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,020
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

311
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,193
Hello?

312
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,265
We'll be there.

313
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,798
KAREN: Step inside, guys.

314
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,567
Your case just
became legitimate.

315
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,834
Consider yourself hired.

316
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,739
I need answers
and I need them quick.

317
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,970
Well, I do have
something, Chief.

318
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,706
I'm getting a...
I'm getting skin pigment.

319
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,443
Bronzed, glistening...

320
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,646
Adonis-like skin pigment.

321
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,984
You lead me
through this field,

322
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,284
you let me ask one question,

323
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,986
I guarantee it's going to
come down to spray tanning.

324
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,829
Well, this guy's never seen
the inside of a tanning salon.

325
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,368
I don't think
he ever saw the sun.

326
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,460
You've got 2<i>4</i> hours.
Call me with something.

327
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,506
CARLTON: Grab a CSI.
Verify time of death.

328
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:31,100
Looks like we might
have to open a kennel
for all these copycats.

329
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,473
SHAWN: Well,
we're back to square one.

330
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,570
GUS: I don't know, Shawn.

331
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,376
Maybe square one
is the answer.

332
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,177
Maybe this is something
beyond our comprehension.

333
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,774
Something otherworldly.

334
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,649
I hear what you're saying.
Do me a favor.

335
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,221
What?
Let go of the alien angle.

336
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,550
We need something solid, Gus.

337
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,523
Something...
Something concrete.
You heard the Chief.

338
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,227
Dude,

339
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,637
how do you feel
about leprechauns?

340
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,199
(IN IRISH ACCENT)
Oh, hello, me buckos.
I'm Marvin.

341
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,940
Welcome to Shenanigans,
home of the world-famous
Blarney Stone fajitas.

342
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,276
Hello, Marvin.

343
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,873
We're here to
speak with a leprechaun.

344
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,578
(IN AMERICAN ACCENT)
Ha, ha, very funny.
Please stop.

345
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,382
My tummy's aching
from laughing so hard.

346
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,888
You guys want a table or what?

347
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,754
Dude, give me some props.
He's got a hat with
a buckle on it,

348
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:20,849
everything's green.

349
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,553
What?
He's not a leprechaun.

350
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,855
Will you do me a favor?

351
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,591
In your funny accent,
will you say,
"magically delicious"?

352
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,603
Is that the world-famous
clover stamp?

353
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:34,730
That's the one.

354
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,297
Will you stamp
my buddy's wrist?

355
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,206
Whatever floats your boat,
man.

356
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,335
It's for our
nighttime events there.

357
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,776
But, hey,
you can have it
in the daytime, too.

358
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:41,938
What nighttime events?

359
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,413
We have speed dating here.

360
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,676
Speed dating?
Yeah.

361
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,513
Don't laugh.
It's actually one of
our most popular events.

362
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,644
Guys come in here,
and they sign up,
they put down a hundred bucks

363
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,745
and they get fixed up
with all sorts of people

364
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,153
on little six minute
mini-dates.

365
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,588
Did you say a hundred bucks?
Hundred bucks.

366
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,989
How about fifty bucks
for three minute dates?

367
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,253
Twenty five bucks
for a minute and a half.

368
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,955
I float you a ten spot,
you introduce us to
somebody for 15 seconds.

369
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,933
How about you guys
either get a table

370
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,525
or I'm going to have to
ask you to leave the podium?

371
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,591
How about
"magically delicious"?

372
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,796
Will you say
"magically delicious"?

373
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,964
No, but I can say police
if you don't get your
butts out of here.

374
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,271
(IN IRISH ACCENT)
Hello, there. I'm Marvin.
Welcome to Shenanigans,

375
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,673
home of the world famous
Blarney Stone fajitas.

376
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,977
Yeah, I tried
the speed dating
thing a couple of times.

377
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,875
I just didn't think
it had anything to do
with the case

378
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,249
and I was a little
embarrassed about it.

379
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,412
Wow.

380
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,819
You paid a hundred bucks?

381
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,552
Mr. Turk, we feel
it has everything to do
with the case, all right?

382
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:32,120
Both Phil Keiser and the guy
who turned up dead attended
these speed dating events.

383
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:36,600
(CLOCKS CHIMING)

384
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,873
Do you remember anything
strange happening there?

385
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,307
Or meeting anyone odd?

386
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,812
The only odd thing was
that the ladies didn't take
to me like they usually do.

387
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,350
That's beyond odd.
I can't imagine why, Fred.

388
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,443
Here's the thing, though.

389
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,216
Other strange things
have been happening to me
ever since I was at the event.

390
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,278
Like what?

391
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,257
Well, I applied
for a job recently.

392
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,520
I was the perfect candidate.

393
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,460
I had several interviews
and then suddenly
after the final one,

394
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,724
I was rejected.

395
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,132
Let me ask you a question,
Freddy, and please be honest.

396
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,898
Were you on time
for these interviews?

397
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,595
Yes, why do you ask?

398
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,767
I have no reason.

399
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,204
I think there's
a woman involved here,

400
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,537
who had it out
for these guys.

401
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,009
We need to get
a firsthand look at
this speed dating phenomenon.

402
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,137
Not for a hundred bucks,
we don't.

403
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,407
Gus, please,
leave it to me.

404
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,108
Let me get this straight.

405
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,514
There is a dead body

406
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,176
and a murderer
loose in our city

407
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,015
and you want
the Santa Barbara
Police Department

408
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,578
to pay for you
to go on dates?

409
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,123
Yes, that's correct.

410
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,716
I mean,
I suppose we could
split it if we had to.

411
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,728
What's that called?
Going... Going Dutch?

412
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:39,963
Go Dutch.

413
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,773
I am not paying for your
dating services,
Mr. Spencer.

414
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,870
Look, here's the catch,
Chief.

415
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,377
I'm going to be reading
these people, psychically.

416
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:54,810
And I don't need six minutes.

417
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,142
Give me <i>4</i>0 seconds
with these people.

418
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,376
I'll be able to tell you
if they had anything to
do with the murder.

419
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,940
And you know what?
Gus and I,

420
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,646
we really did
try to negotiate

421
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,415
some sort of
partial usage rate,

422
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,047
but we got shut down
by that leprechaun.

423
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,183
Mr. Spencer, enough.

424
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,489
Wait,
I'm getting something else.

425
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:14,363
It's a woman in sexy
high heeled strappy shoes.

426
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,458
<i>She's roughly 5'2".</i>

427
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:21,069
Jules,
may I please have a pen
and something to write on?

428
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,449
"To Lassy,

429
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,015

"H and K's, Shawn."

What the hell is this?

433
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,059
H and K's stands for
hugs and kisses.

434
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,135
Not that part. This part.

435
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,694
GUS: It's a tire pattern.

436
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,238
Run it through the system
and we'll know what kind
of car she drives.

437
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,174
Okay.
I'll give you
a shot at this,

438
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,834
but you're not going alone.

439
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,937
O'Hara,
I want you to go along
with these guys undercover

440
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,447
working things
from the other side.

441
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,676
See if you can
sift any information
from these women.

442
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,775
Will do.

443
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,581
Chief, I think that's
the best idea you've ever had.

444
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,645
Shawn,
I am so glad
you're on board.

445
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,656
KAREN: Detective Lassiter,
I'm going to need you, too.

446
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,419
We don't know what
this woman's type is,

447
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,085
and, besides,
you're now leading the case.

448
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,753
Yeah, you know, Chief,
with all due respect,

449
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,991
I'm really pretty busy
working this case from
another angle.

450
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,692
I mean,
I ran the toxicology reports

451
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,292
and I found that
all three victims tested
positive for trace amounts

452
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,836
of the street drug GHB.

453
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,236
But our dead guy had
a pre-existing
heart condition.

454
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,899
So there was a pattern.

455
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:30,999
I think
the murder was accidental.

456
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:35,342
And I like that track.
Now, follow it up by going
to the speed dating thing.

457
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,675
It's just a date, Lassiter.

458
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,714
You do know how to conduct
yourself on a date, don't you?

I always wear this.

Exactly. Lassy,
you look like a cop.

00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,975
Now come on, man.

471
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,404
Is that your holster?
Of course it is.

You're here to

not shoot somebody.

473
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,185
You got to loosen up.
Come on, take off the tie.

474
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,153
I'm not taking fashion tips
from you.

475
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,382
You need to show
some chest hair.

477
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,585

say before this thing starts.

And your next date will begin.

493
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,092

six minutes is
not a long time

Wow.

506
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,358
Kids can be cruel.
Yeah.

507
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,424
You know you could
probably change that.

508
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,295
What's your mom's
maiden name?

509
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,594
Buzzteets.

510
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,533
Wow, yeah.

511
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,302
Teets, as in...

512
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,034
Yeah. Yeah.
All my ancestry,
we're farmers.

513
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,303
Oh, hey,
I was raised on a farm.

514
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,537
No kidding.

515
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,945
I had this most adorable
little pet goat named Cassie.

516
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,141
Goat?
Yeah.

517
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,582
Did you ever have any,
you know, pets growing up?

518
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:54,676
What were their names?

519
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,618
Oh, what's your
favorite color?

LORRAINE: Move along.

522
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,585
I think these people
might have more luck dating

523
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,060
if they'd ask more
interesting questions.

524
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,153
I just hope,
I don't get pile driven.

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,967
Carlton, I hope
this isn't too forward of me,

527
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,367
but you have kind eyes.

528
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:20,873
Thank you.

529
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,413
This is uncanny.
I know.

530
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,507
God, you know,
I never meet anyone I
connect with at these things.

531
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,417
That's why I didn't
even bother dressing up.
I mean I've given up a little.

532
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,852
I think you look great.

533
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,218
Thank you.

534
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,952
So, what kind of
car do you drive?

535
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,217
Excuse me?

536
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,094
You drive a sports car?
Mustang, maybe? 2003?

537
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,898
That's kind of
a shallow question, isn't it?

538
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,764
Do you like hanging out
in fields?

539
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,633
Okay, you know what,
I think this date's over.

540
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,263
No, I've got
three minutes left.

541
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,830
Where were you on
the night of the 18th?

542
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,172
You know, normally,
I would wear a dress.

543
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:53,700
And heels?

544
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,278
Yeah, I guess, maybe.

545
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,044
Like open-toed
strappy ones?

546
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,379
What? Huh?
Huh?

547
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,846
Is that what you
have in your closet?

548
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,754
A lot of high-heeled shoes?

549
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,489
Do you have a foot fetish?

550
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:09,954
No.

551
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:17,229
Look at us.
A couple kids on
a proper date, huh?

552
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:18,701
You got some goosebumps?

553
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,203
Shawn, this isn't a date.
It's work.

554
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,899
You're absolutely right.
But, hey,

555
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,237
you still got six minutes
to ask me anything you want.

556
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,401
So, what do you
want to know?

557
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,638
What are you dying to know
about Shawn Spencer, the man?
The man.

558
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,113
Oddly enough,
I don't think I have
anything I'm dying to know.

559
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,549
Okay, Jules, don't lie,
because lying is unbecoming.

560
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,547
I'll go first.

or a bunch of dead guys?

aren't you? A little bit.

00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,166
Have fun on your next date,
but I want you
to think about that, okay?

573
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,505
Like if that really happened.

574
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,944
Bye, Shawn.

575
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,588
Go on.
Tell her she looks pretty.

576
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,353
Yeah, no can do.

577
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:00,930
That's it, people.

578
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,372
You should have
completed all your dates.

Please score your cards
and check up front at the bar

who you matched from your
questionnaires.

581
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,239
Okay?

582
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:11,372
I'm sorry.

583
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,439

00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,007

00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:17,020
I just haven't been
a high-heel guy
since <i>Single White Female.</i>

586
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,318
I just... Yeah.

587
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,083
Thank you.

588
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,183
Dude,

589
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,886
I think that Darcy girl
might be the one.

590
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,054
She's the right height,

591
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,256
she drives an
'0<i>4</i> Trans Am.

592
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,356
And she wears
nothing but heels.

593
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:29,457
How did you find out
about the heels?

594
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,900
And she works in
pharmaceutical sales,
just like you.

595
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,597
Now, would she have access
to that GHB stuff?

596
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,106
Well, she certainly would have
access to the drugs
to synthesize her own.

597
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,039
That's sweet.
Dude, you got
to ask her out.

598
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,599
What? And go out
with a possible murderer?

599
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:40,975
You must be out of your mind.
I'm not doing that.

600
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,911
Gus, I got
to see her on a date.
I got to see her in action.

601
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,278
I got to look,
I got to listen,
I got to feel.

602
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,544
Shawn, if we think it's her,
let's tell Lassiter and Juliet

603
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,607
and get them to bring her in.

604
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,017
You see what happens
when we blurt out
our theories.

605
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,418
We totally whiffed
on the tanning salon.

606
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,683
All right, fine.
You go out with her then.

607
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,554
I would, but
she matched up with you.

608
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,860
Oh, give her the sweetness.

the sweetness.

612
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,751
I need a drink.
I got to pee.

613
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,366
Look, I don't know
what to say to her.

614
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,232
I ran out of topics
on the way over here.

615
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,169
Plus, she keeps
wanting to rub my head.
What's up with that?

616
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,434
Gus, everybody wants
to rub your head.

617
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,442
Look, you're doing fine,
okay?

618
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,602
Here, here.

619
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,442
Here's a list of
conversation topics,
basic starters.

620
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:52,108
You got your ball,
head on over there.
I'm right behind you.

621
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,913
"You're stranded on
a deserted island and you have
to procreate the species."

622
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:55,975
Really?

623
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,447
This is gold.
I give you gold.

625
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:08,557
Yes!

626
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:10,790
That was good.

627
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,398
Shawn?

628
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,499
Detective O'Hara.

629
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,977
Shawn,
what are you doing here?

630
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,411
Bowling, at a high level.

631
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,607
By yourself,
on a Saturday night?

632
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,878
I'm in a league.
It's semi-pro.

633
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,817
I could have gone pro,
but you know what,
I made a choice.

634
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:32,584
I like to
get 1 <i>4</i>- 15 hours
of practice in... a week.

635
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:33,715
Wow.

636
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,555
I had no idea you were
so serious about bowling.

637
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:36,719
Quite serious.
Quite serious.

638
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,558
Matter of fact,
Lego wants to
sponsor me this year.

639
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,961
Oh, my God.
That's great.

640
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,499
They also want me
to wear shoes
made out of Legos.

641
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,125
So, I'm torn.

642
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:48,370
Okay.
Well, I don't want to
interrupt your practicing.

643
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,533
Yeah, yeah,
I should get back.

644
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,543
I'm really not here
to mess around.

645
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,274
Oh, my God,
I am so rude.

646
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,839
Kyle, Shawn.
Shawn, Kyle.

647
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,181
No, that's my bowling hand.
There you go.

648
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,550
Shawn works for
the police department.

649
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,987
He's a psychic.

650
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,354
Oh, cool, a psychic.

651
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,792
Nice. Can you
tell me anything
about my future?

652
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:14,491
Oh, Kyle, please.
That's not really
how it works.

653
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,328
Though I am...
I am getting something.

654
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,768
It's...
It's hazy, but...

655
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:24,607
I'm sensing
that you're going to
face a lot of rejection.

656
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:25,900
Work-wise?

657
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,605
No. No. Not work-wise.

658
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,071
Not work-wise.

659
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,048
You know what?
I'm going to go.

660
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,448
You kids get back
to doing your thing.

661
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:36,180
You know,
she bowl, then you bowl,
then she bowl and you bowl.

662
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,278
And you've got
the tight tuck

663
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,949
and it's sweet
and it's perfect.
See you, Jules.

664
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,890
Okay, okay.

665
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,261
Hold on a second.
I'll be right back. Okay?

666
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,526
Okay.

667
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,063
Where the hell you been?

668
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:54,003
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
I ran into somebody.
How you doing? You okay?

669
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,131
Too okay.
She wants to go
back to my place.

670
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,333
Oh, this is great.

671
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,899
We'll get all the
information we need.

672
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,036
No. The problem is
I told her I live
at the beach.

673
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,170

00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,159
You have my word.

842
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,219
I better.

843
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,797
<i>Lassiter, let him go.</i>

844
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:06,563
<i>Excuse me?</i>

845
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,139
Release him.
<i>Release him?</i>

846
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,734
<i>Why am I</i>
<i>going to release him?</i>
<i>Why would I release him?</i>

847
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,106
<i>KAREN: Release him.</i>

848
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,035
What?

849
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,205
Why don't you
get your shillelagh
and get out of here?

850
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,305
You got it.

851
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,984
Excuse me,
may I help you people?

852
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,453
Yeah.
We're here for
the speed dating event.

853
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,547
Oh, I'm sorry,
it's already begun.

854
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,990
Oh, wait.
I remember you.

855
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,357
Look,
you seem like
a decent fellow

856
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,023
and I'd hate for you
to waste another $100.

857
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,124
But I was watching you

858
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,998
and you're not
very good at this.

859
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,470
Police business. Scat.

860
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,404
Okay, I need to breathe
and I need some space
to do my thing.

861
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:47,671
Okay.

862
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,544
GUS: Shawn.

863
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:52,579
Oh, good, buddy,
you got the message.

864
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:53,980
It's not Darcy.
You're in the clear.

865
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:56,815
You're going to pay, Shawn.
You are going to pay.
Believe me.

866
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,515
No offense, but it's tough
to feel threatened by you

867
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,352
when you're
wearing that shirt.
Is that a hibiscus?

868
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,415
It's not my shirt, Shawn.
It's your dad's shirt.

869
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,586
He had to loan me one
because mine was covered
in snot tears.

870
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,563
I can't...
Did you know
he also takes bubble baths?

871
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:08,656
So did John Wayne.

872
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,360
I know, but can you
name one other guy?

873
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,731
What's going on?

874
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,168
I solved the case.
It's actually got
a decent twist.

875
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,569
Have a seat.

876
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,275
Well,
I'm actually kind
of an adventurist.

877
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,437
You know, I was caught
in an avalanche once
and in order to survive,

878
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,448
I drank my own urine
and I ate three of my toes,

879
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,677
which is, you know,
maybe why you saw me
limp when I came in.

880
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,119
Hey, big guy,
you mind if I...
You mind if I cut in here?

881
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:32,951
Oh, I don't know.
We're kind of in a...

882
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,185
You're going to be okay.
Okay, all right.

883
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,628
I really hope
it wasn't rude.
It seemed a little rude.

884
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,029
Well, actually,
I should thank you
because he was awful.

885
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,129
GLENDA:
That is a very nice name.

886
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,999
But you're kind of cute.

887
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,405
So, navy blue's
your favorite color?

888
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,774
Mine's green.

889
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,210
You know you seem European.

890
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,145
You're sure
you don't have
family history there?

891
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,476
What's your mother's
maiden name?

892
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,042
So, after volunteering
for the animal shelter,
I decided...

893
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,815
Can I just...
Can I stop you
for a moment?

894
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,255
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

895
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:12,053
Everybody, I'm sorry,
if I could just get your
attention for a sec here.

896
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,187
I'm sorry.

897
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,663
I want to pick this up
right where we left off

898
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,224
if there's any time
left on the clock, okay?

899
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,930
Because you seem
like a terrific person.
You deserve someone special.

900
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,973
Someone
who makes you feel safe,
but also a little dirty,

901
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,064
you know
what I'm talking about?

902
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,836
Everyone deserves
someone special,

903
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,105
each and every one
of you. All of you.

904
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,080
Look, is your perfect match
here tonight?
I don't know. I'm not sure.

905
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,582
But the point is, you're here
and you put your hearts
on the line

906
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,414
and that's all
that really matters.

907
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:39,855
Unfortunately, there are two
people here that do not share
your pure desires.

908
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,892
They're not here
to find their soul mates.

909
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,824
They're not here
to fall in love.

910
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,623
As a matter of fact,
they're not even single.

911
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,357
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

912
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:52,130
You, Glenda and you,
Marvin, are a couple.

913
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,467
An odd couple, to be sure.
But a couple.

914
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,506
Matter of fact,
you're married.

915
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:57,939
That is absurd.

916
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,442
The tan lines
on your fingers

917
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,671
where your wedding rings
used to be will prove...

918
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,373
Please, not with
the tanning thing again.

919
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,937
...that not only
are you married,

920
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,211
but that tanning had something
to do with this investigation.

921
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,185
Thank you, Chief.
Now the question is,

922
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,778
why would a married couple
infiltrate a singles event?

923
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,016
Well, the answer is simple.

924
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,991
It's a perfect place
to commit their crime.

925
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,519
They're here to rob you,
ladies and gentlemen.

926
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:22,327
To steal from you the one
thing that is invariably
your own.

927
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,529
Identity.

928
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,292
I told you that
leprechaun was bad.

929
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,998
SHAWN:
Marvin did copy
the questionnaires

930
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,631
to get these people's
phone numbers and addresses.

931
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,905
And you,
Glenda, cleverly found
the answers to questions like,

932
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,002
<i>"What's your mother's</i>
<i>maiden name?"</i>

933
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,569
<i>"What's your favorite color?"</i>
<i>"Did you have any pets?"</i>

934
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,205
"What are their names?"
"Name all the Bee Gees."

935
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:41,080
Those are the same questions
that you get at the bank
from security

936
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,052
when you try
to authorize
a credit card.

937
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,212
So what was left?

938
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:47,519
Get the credits card numbers
from these poor guys without
them knowing they were robbed.

939
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:49,183
So you came up with a plan.

940
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,127
<i>You followed them,</i>
<i>you drugged them.</i>

941
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:56,189
<i>You took down the numbers</i>
<i>and you deposited them</i>
<i>naked in a field</i>

942
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,929
<i>where they</i>
<i>woke up disoriented,</i>

943
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,198
grassy-assed,
but none the wiser.

944
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:04,136
Fred Turk did see
a little alien that day.

945
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,199
Except it wasn't
an extraterrestrial.

946
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:11,613
It was Marvin
in his ridiculous, stupid
green leprechaun costume.

947
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,643
And they would have
gotten away with it,
too, folks,

948
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,482
if it wasn't for
their last victim.

949
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,284
The one who didn't
quite wake up.

950
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,657
Not so fast!

951
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,027
Because that isn't
even the worst of it.

952
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:31,925
The worst of it is
that you two stole
a very valuable seat

953
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:34,232
that belonged
to a single person.

954
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:38,105
A single person
who believes in
the power of love.

955
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,475
You should be
ashamed of yourselves.

956
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,137
Both of you.

957
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,713
(BELL DINGS)

958
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,913
Murder, wow.
That's a speed dating first.

959
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,786
Be sure to check up
at the bar

960
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,850
and see who you match
from your questionnaires.
Okay?

961
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,197
I'm sorry about that.

962
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,291
Wow.
You know, I just...

963
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:05,665
It was from here, though.
You know that.

964
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:09,399
So, we were talking
about what? We were
talking about...

965
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,202
Beagles.
Beagles, that's so sweet.

966
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,802
Because you like them
and you put little
sweaters on them.

967
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,006
Yeah, well, sometimes.

968
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,708
Excuse me, sorry.
May I cut in?

969
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,809
It's my parole officer.

970
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,148
Oh.
Yeah.

971
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,278
Okay.
I'm sorry.

972
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,982
Sure.
I'm sorry.

973
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,094
Sorry.
Where did you...

974
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,755
I thought you...
I thought you
were on a date.

975
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,321
I was. It's over.

976
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,889
Over?
Mmm-hmm.

977
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,060
Over, like
he laid one on you

978
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:41,434
on the front porch
and you got little
butterflies, over?

979
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,530
Or you...
You pretended like
you had a headache

980
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,472
and you called it
quits early, over?

981
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:49,502
Not that it's any
of your business,
but he can't bowl.

982
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,810
And that's a deal-breaker.
I see.

983
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,975
Hmm. But, look,
the only reason
I sat down

984
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:57,179
is because I wanted
to clear one thing up.

985
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:58,716
I don't take any stock

986
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,155
in those profile
matching thingies

987
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,419
we did
the other night.

988
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,490
Jules, I was
just messing
around. I...

989
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:08,760
I copied your card
over your shoulder.
Like verbatim.

990
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:12,325
What, you thought maybe
I sew my own pajamas?
That's...

991
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,428
Right, okay.
Well, good,

992
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:17,736
because I don't
want there to be any
weirdness between us

993
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,470
and it seems like
we're going to be
working together a lot.

994
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:21,841
All the time.
Yeah.

995
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,938
So, nice job on
the case, by the way.
Thank you very much.

996
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,346
Yeah.
Thank you.

997
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,078
Okay, all right,
I'll see you at work.

998
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,677
That's how we do it,
work style.
Yeah.

999
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,290
See you at work.
See you.

1000
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:38,821
Where's she going?

1001
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,330
You know what, I think
I undersold the fajitas.

1002
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:42,558
Well, it wouldn't
be the first time

1003
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,998
a female walked out on you
in the middle of a meal.

1004
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,161
Oh, please, Gus,
we're talking
about Jules here.

1005
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,761
It's not like
we were on a date.

1006
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,466
Plus it wouldn't work out.
It would never work out.

1007
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,304
I'd have to
really bowl well.

1008
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,571
And apparently
that's a deal-breaker.

1009
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,076
You know
how awful those are?

1010
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,743
I'm hungry, man.
We don't have to stay.

1011
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,353
Dude. Jerk chicken.

1012
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,253
Oh, you know,
that's right.

1013
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:21,463
<i>In between the lines</i>
<i>there's a lot of obscurity</i>

1014
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,871
<i>I'm not inclined</i>
<i>to resign to maturity</i>

1015
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,343
<i>If it's all right</i>
<i>then you're all wrong</i>

1016
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:32,746
<i>But why bounce around</i>
<i>to the same damn song?</i>

1017
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:36,946
<i>You'd rather run</i>
<i>when you can't crawl</i>

1018
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:42,759
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>That I'm not telling the truth</i>

1019
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:46,262
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>They just don't have any proof</i>

1020
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,163
<i>Embrace the deception</i>
<i>Learn how to bend</i>

1021
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:53,260
<i>Your worst inhibitions</i>
<i>tend to psych you out</i>
<i>in the end</i>

1022
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,305
<i>I know, you know</i>

1023
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,774
<i>I know, you know</i>
