1
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,307
This isn't happening to me!

2
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,968
What is happening to you,
Shawn?

3
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,909
Only the worst thing ever!

4
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:15,777
A missing Captain Delicious
magic mood ring!

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,784
Dad, this is a crime.
Can you have them arrested?

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,877
First of all, Shawn, no,
this is not a crime.

7
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,546
Can't you just haul them in
for questioning?

8
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,647
Lay into them a little?
And who is "them"?

9
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,783
You know, the cereal people?

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,851
Oh, the cereal people, huh?

11
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,630
Well,
I'll tell you what, Shawn,
you can spend a lot of time

12
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,724
calling <i>4</i>11 to get the number
for your cereal people,

13
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,029
they're gonna stick you
on hold forever,

14
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:37,262
listening to bad music.

15
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,305
Finally, you're gonna get
some dimwitted secretary,

16
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,737
who's gonna
take your message,

17
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,298
and then she's gonna
throw it in a waste bucket.

18
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,209
Or you can use the skills
I taught you

19
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,710
and you can outsmart them.

20
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,046
What am I missing?

21
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,420
Where is the ring?
Well, it'd be at the bottom.

22
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,857
Not in this box, you're right.

23
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,088
The big old bad cereal company
messed up.

24
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,994
So, you grab another box,
tough luck.

25
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,061
Where's the ring now?

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,828
At the bottom.
Now I got to eat
the whole box.

27
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,596
And where's the ring now?

28
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:14,935
At the top!

29
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,239
That's right.
You see, sometimes, Shawn,
you don't have to dig so deep.

30
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,007
All you gotta do is
turn something upside down
to make it right side up.

31
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,446
And then...

32
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:26,880
you get your prize.

33
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,386
Thanks, Dad!

34
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,616
Explain to me again
why we couldn't sit
in a restaurant

35
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,159
and eat
like civilized people.

36
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,195
Moving is good, Gus,
it helps the digestion.

37
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,889
Plus, you and I
never do this anymore.

38
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,192
What? Eat and jog?

39
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,062
No, talk. Just talk.

40
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,128
Check in with each other,
as men.

41
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,465
I wanna know
how you are.

42
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,505
I wanna know
how Gus is.

43
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,908
Really? Like you're
really asking me?

44
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,170
Yes, I'm really asking,
because I care.

45
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,575
Wow, okay.

46
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,479
Well, we've been
working cases nonstop
for a month.

47
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,209
To be honest, I'm burnt.

48
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,384
I just want to take a nap.

49
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,817
I couldn't agree
with you more, buddy.

50
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,354
I think we should
lay low for a bit.

51
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,583
No more cases.
Oh, I'm so glad
to hear you say that.

52
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:05,919
I was kind of worried
about telling you.

53
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,892
Don't be a silly goose.

54
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,596
Now, we've had a good talk,
I think we both felt it,

55
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,632
and look at this.
Here we are.

56
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,600
What is this, Shawn?

57
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,933
Okay, here's the thing.

58
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,032
The police may have
found a body,

59
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,306
which I may have picked up
on my police scanner,

60
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,609
which I may have
brought with me.

61
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,807
No cases, Shawn.

62
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,649
No cases. We go in, we see.
We say hello. And we leave.

63
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,854
Say hello?
This is a crime scene.
You can't just walk in there.

64
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,790
McNab. Nabby!

65
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,153
Buzz.

66
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,319
Buzz? Seriously?

67
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,056
That's his first name.
Don't you ever talk to him?

68
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,995
Why would I talk
to anybody named Buzz?

69
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,726
Shawn! My man!

70
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,858
Pow!

71
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,662
Okay with... Yes.
You look trim.

72
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,131
Somebody made
their wedding weight.

73
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,973
Five more pounds. I'm close.
But I still have a month.

74
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,741
You'll get there.
You remember my partner?

75
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,782
Sure, yeah. Matt, right?

76
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,408
Gus.

77
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,543
Right.

78
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,780
So, what do you got
going on up there?
Don't hold out on me now.

79
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,981
Looks like suicide.

80
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,854
A guy from the phone company
found the victim
in his apartment.

81
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,518
Been up there
for a few days already.

82
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,822
Few days?

83
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,625
You mind if we head up,
take a look,
poke around a little?

84
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,565
Oh, I don't know.
Lassiter's up there
and he's in a mood.

85
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,432
Yeah, we just, uh,
got his coffee.

86
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,096
Wanted to bring it by,
make it right.

87
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,400
Oh, that's nice of you.

88
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,067
He asked me to get it,
but this is perfect.

89
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,639
Hey, did you just sip that?

90
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,744
You don't taste
Lassiter's coffee
before you give it to him?

91
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,183
That surprises me, Buzz.

92
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,448
He's so particular.
No cream, no sugar...

93
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,989
It's three creams,
four sugars.

94
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,190
Yeah, it is.

95
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,252
Sharp as a tack.
You!

96
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,318
And fit!

97
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,902
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

98
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,507
We found a note.

99
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,046
The body's been here
at least three days.
Maybe more.

100
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,275
All signs point to a 11-<i>44</i>.

101
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,614
Three 11-<i>44</i>s
in four months?

102
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,880
There must be something
in the water.
Uh-huh.

103
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,388
All right, ladies
and gentlemen, listen up.
You know the procedure.

104
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,915
I want this done right.
I do not want any mistakes.

105
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,395
Hey, blowie,

106
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,855
I know you're new,
but next time if you want

107
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,525
to get your spit
all over the evidence,

108
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,159
why don't you
just lick it?

109
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,199
Clearly he doesn't need
any more coffee.

110
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,467
Okay, there is the dead guy.
Can we go now?

111
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,940
Relax. We just got here.
Have some mee krob.

112
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,501
How do you just eat
when there's a dead guy
laying there?

113
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,979
What, is that rude?
Am I supposed to share?

114
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,946
Forensics.

115
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,047
Act natural.

116
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,721
(GASPS) That's it!

117
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,190
What? What do you see?

118
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:55,992
Red pepper flakes.

119
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,086
Is that a clue
or something?

120
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,687
No, it's a delicious spice,

121
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,165
and it's exactly what
my mee krob needs.
I told you this.

122
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,871
What are you doing?
This is a crime scene.
You can't touch stuff.

123
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,003
What?

124
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,474
Seriously, check this out.

125
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,719
A marinating steak?

126
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,222
What, you want
to eat that, too?

127
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,053
No, but don't you find
that a little odd?

128
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,717
That a man
would eat a steak?

129
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,421
No, that a man
who was ready
to kill himself

130
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,828
would take the time
to marinate a steak
for a future meal?

131
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:36,594
Dude,

132
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,102
this was not suicide.
This was murder.

133
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,017
The door latch
is still intact.

134
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:00,020
Now I ask you.
If you were gonna
kill yourself,

135
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,720
wouldn't you want
the door to be locked

136
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,695
so that no one
could barge in on you
right in the middle?

137
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,597
What? I don't...
What is it? I don't...

138
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,993
What in the name
of sweet justice

139
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,661
are you two doing
in my crime scene?

140
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,137
Your crime scene?
That's funny.

141
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,639
I didn't see your name
on it anywhere.

142
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,902
(MOCKS) Get out.
We are.

143
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:20,878
Just thought you might
wanna know that this thing
here, not a suicide.

144
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,005
Great.

145
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:25,744
Thanks for that. Really.
And thanks also for bringing
a snack to the crime scene.

146
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,654
Oh, boy. Oh!

147
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,624
(GASPING)

148
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,628
I'm sensing a...

149
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,392
I'm sensing
there was someone here.

150
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:42,628
Someone here in the room
with the victim when he died.

151
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,095
Someone with
a sliver of grease

152
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,968
on his or her shoe.

153
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,875
No, I'm not sensing
a struggle. No struggle.

154
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,743
The door.

155
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,711
Did you have to break down
the door when you got here?

156
00:06:58,785 --> 00:06:59,774
No, it was open. Why?

157
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,581
No, no.
Don't encourage him.

158
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,916
Get up! McNab,

159
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,719
I want you to escort
these two men
out of here now!

160
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,987
Come on, let me
read the witnesses.
You know, due diligence.

161
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,687
Spencer, we did
the due diligence.

162
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,027
It was a suicide.
There is no crime.
There are no witnesses.

163
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,693
You're wrong.
There is a witness.

164
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,928
There's a cat.

165
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,171
I wanna talk to that cat.

166
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,345
As soon as he's finished
licking himself.

00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,327
(SHAWN MEOWING)

343
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,668
Yes, this is it.

344
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,405
The girl that was
found in her car,

345
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,533
Gloria Starks, she's here.

346
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,342
She's here with us.

347
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,981
(IN GIRL'S VOICE)
Oh, despair!

348
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,587
I fear that you will leave me.
What choice do I have?

349
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,757
(SINGING) <i>I dazzle</i>

350
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,694
<i>And I stretch</i>

351
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,393
<i>I dazzle</i>

352
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,169
<i>And I stretch</i>

353
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,875
What the hell
is going on here?

354
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,776
(SHUSHING) Mr. Spencer,
this is telling me nothing.

355
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,538
He can't hear you right now
'cause, see,
he's channeling the cat

356
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,083
who's channeling Gloria.

357
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,482
<i>I dazzle</i>

358
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,753
Well, then
what are we looking at?

359
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,818
Bad acting.

360
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,359
GUS: I think she wants
you to see
something in the paper.

361
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,122
Gloria's trying to
tell you something.

362
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,491
<i>Dazzle and stretch</i>

363
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,465
"Seventy percent off
on storm doors
and window panes.

364
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,901
"Everything must go."

365
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,138
"Struggling actress
lands big break in
Santa Barbara play."

366
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,908
So what.
GUS: So what?

367
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,643
Does that sound like a woman
who would kill herself?

368
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,548
Please,
all actresses are crazies.

369
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:29,314
I know, I dated one
in college once.
She had a nose ring.

370
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,616
(GROANS)

371
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,247
Good work, little buddy.

372
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,625
Whoa!
I don't know.

373
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,157
This is something.
Something?
Oh, come on, you guys.

374
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,595
That's the biggest thing
that ever happened
for that girl.

375
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,065
Now you need to stop
waiting around
for another suicide

376
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,500
and start looking
for a serial killer.

377
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,901
Spencer,

378
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,199
get off my lap.

379
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,051
What does this mean?

380
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,058
I have no idea,
but I've seen it
on <i>Numb3rs</i> all the time

381
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,650
and it seems
to work for them.

382
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,187
You ready to give up?

383
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,130
Four separate suicides,
two of which occurred
before we came on the case,

384
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,463
and I don't see
a pattern of any kind.

385
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,059
Different ages,
different sexes.

386
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,832
Different
socio-economic levels.

387
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:20,894
Different methods of death.

388
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,271
No duplicate weapons,
locations.

389
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,207
Man, what have we got?

390
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:29,111
First we have a jumper,
second, an oven, third, pills,
fourth, carbon monoxide.

391
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,276
They all have to be
connected somehow.

392
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,210
And what I see is
whole lot of nothing.

393
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,914
(SCOFFS) Nothing.

394
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,455
You see, sometimes, Shawn,
you don't have to dig so deep.

395
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,256
You just need to turn
things upside down

396
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,286
to make them right side up.

397
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,295
And there's your prize.

398
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,261
Wait a minute.

399
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,309
GUS: What are you doing?

400
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,473
Turning things upside down
in order to make them
right side up.

401
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,745
And there's the prize.

402
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,548
GUS: This is the prize?

403
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,456
Going to the first
dead guy's place
and what?

404
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,517
Talk to a dead guy?

405
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,791
No, we talk to
the dead guy's brother.

406
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,129
The dead guy's brother
lives at the dead guy's place?

407
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,362
(BUZZING)
They were roommates.
But that's the point.

408
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,131
He's getting rid
of the apartment.

409
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,431
(BUZZING)

410
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,167
And we're here to rent it.

411
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,640
We're what?

412
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,271
Why can't we for once
just talk to somebody as us?

413
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,008
Because, Gus, I don't
want him to be on guard.

414
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,642
If he thinks we're
investigating something,
he'll clam up.

415
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,550
Wes Hiltonbock?
Yeah?

416
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,292
Hey, Shawn Spencer.
I talked to you on the phone
about the apartment,

417
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,759
and this is Gus.
It would actually
be for both of us.

418
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,493
Yeah, okay, come on.

419
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,197
Thanks, man.

420
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,129
Just so you guys know,
the utilities are included,

421
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:06,510
but I would require
first and last month and
a sizable security deposit.

422
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,138
Oh, that's not a problem.
You take cats?

423
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,612
Yeah, I guess so.

424
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,082
You two guys have a cat?

425
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,122
We do, actually.
He's sort of like our child.

426
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:21,116
I see. How do you guys
know each other?

427
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,626
We're partners.

428
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,455
Got you.

429
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,022
Oh, no, no, no.
No, it's fine.
Really, I'm totally fine.

430
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,796
No, we're partners
in a private...
Relationship.

431
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,403
Believe it,
it's been a while.

432
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,770
We finish
each other's sentences.

433
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,767
So, tell me, Wes,

434
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,671
why would you want
to give up such
a handsome apartment?

435
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,340
Do you...
Do you not like it anymore?

436
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,477
Ooh, Gus,

437
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,178
good news, shower for two.

438
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,861
Actually I just have
some bad memories here.
I used to...

439
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,297
I used to live here
with my brother,
but he passed away.

440
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,960
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
Was he sick, or...

441
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,535
He killed himself.
Oh, good Lord.

442
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,705
I'm so sorry.

443
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,038
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too.

444
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,571
We were real close,
you know.

445
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,741
God, was he depressed?
I mean, were there signs?
Did you...

446
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:22,248
What am I... I'm sorry,
you don't have
to answer those questions.

447
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,844
No.

448
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,148
Actually, I had no idea
anything was wrong, you know.

449
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,660
I mean,
he had so much to live for.

450
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,859
He was a great guy,
you know.

451
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,160
Smarter than me,
more talented.

452
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,531
He was a great singer.

453
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,299
He was really going places.

454
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:44,742
So look, are you guys...
You guys interested
in the place or...

455
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,437
What do you think, honey?

456
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,741
I think it's great.
I think it's perfect.

457
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:53,444
All right, then.
Well, I got another couple
coming by a little later so...

458
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,346
But I'll let you guys know
either way.

459
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,682
Shower for two?

460
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,518
That was so I could see
your face when I said it.

461
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,717
You know,
you enjoy these things
more than you should.

462
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,420
I suffered through
that for no reason.
We learned nothing.

463
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,057
Yes, but I grabbed this
while we were up there.

464
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,462
You took his mail?

465
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,160
It's not like I took his
<i>Sports Illustrated.</i>
Dude, it's a phone bill.

466
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,931
You can't open
someone else's mail, Shawn.
It's a federal offense.

467
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,700
Gus, he's dead.
So what?

468
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,843
Well, maybe I'll
hold it to my head
and read it psychically.

469
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,935
Hurry up, Shawn.
Gus, who's gonna see us?

470
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,275
Hurry up.

471
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,581
Wait, there's like...

472
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,518
There's like 16 calls here
to some 1-800 stress line.

473
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,653
Including the last call
he made.

474
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,280
I've seen the ads for that.
So what?

475
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,222
A depressed guy
calls a stress line.

476
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,124
And I bet you a hungry guy
calls a pizza place.

477
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,422
That doesn't
tell us anything.

478
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,293
Yeah, but it might
give us a link.

479
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,161
I'm gonna run
the other victims'
phone records.

480
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,361
With what?
Your do-it-yourself
phone record running kit?

481
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,203
The next best thing.

482
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,041
The answer is in
the phone bills.

483
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,476
I need you to run
the victims' phone records.

484
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:55,808
What, no cat this time?

485
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,280
Julie, I'm very serious
about this.

486
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,579
I have a strong sense
about a stress line

487
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,585
and I know the link
is in the phone records.

488
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,111
I don't know why
you would think I would do
something like this for you.

489
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,817
Some have said it's the hair.

490
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,792
Really? Who says that?

491
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,491
Oh, guess what?
We already ran
the phone records

492
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:12,723
and checked out
the dry-cleaning.

493
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,631
Turns out
the pantsuits were picked up
over a week ago.

494
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,669
What kind of
dog and pony show
do you think we run here?

495
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,704
Gus, you wanna
take this one?
No.

496
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,797
Let me put an end
to this non-case
right now, okay?

497
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,069
Yes, all the victims
called the 1-800 stress line.

498
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,974
Not just once,
many times over.

499
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,240
Detective Lassiter and I
have combed everything.

500
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,578
We've gone to
the bone on these.
All the way to the bone?

501
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,709
I know this is hard
for you to grasp,

502
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,618
but these people did have
something in common.
They were troubled

503
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,121
and they were depressed,

504
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,058
and as sad as that is,
they all committed suicide.
Case closed.

505
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,629
We've clearly
wasted your time.

506
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,095
It's not over, is it?
Of course not.

507
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:54,002
They all called the same
help line and they all
killed themselves? Come on!

508
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,540
Shawn, that's what
stressed people do.

509
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,473
Strange how
he gave up so easily.

510
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,069
Yeah, it is.

511
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,248
Maybe we should take
a closer look
at that stress line.

512
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,981
Gloria Starks
only called that line

513
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,782
'cause she was stressed
about an audition.

514
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:13,018
You call a help line
and they find you dead?
That's not very helpful.

515
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,583
What if someone there
is killing the callers and
making it look like suicide?

516
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:20,028
Gus, we go to the stress line,
I think we solve the case.

517
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,028
Come on.

518
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,603
Ta-da!

519
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,401
What is this?

520
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,036
You're looking at
our new business.
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

521
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,979
Are you out of your mind?
You rented office space
for this?

522
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:40,142
Gus,
don't be a crazy hooligan.
I rented a sign.

523
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,125
Now, let's go say hello
to our new neighbors.

524
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,325
Hello, everyone!

525
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,761
Who wants pineapple?
Be honest.

526
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,966
Ah, you guys
can slice it up,
fight over it later.

527
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,008
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
may I help you?

528
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,441
I'm Terrance,
I run the line here.

529
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,705
Terrance, hello.

530
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,306
I'm Shawn Spencer,
this is my partner Gus
"Silly Pants" Jackson.

531
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,112
Just came by
to say hello.

532
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,086
We've opened up
our own little 1-800 thingy
down the hall.

533
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,850
Not as big as you guys.
More of a closet, really.

534
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,288
Your own 1-800 thingy, huh?

535
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,157
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's called Dial-A-Psychic.

536
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,389
Maybe you recognize us.

537
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,433
I am the lead psychic
for the Santa Barbara
police department.

538
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:32,969
McCallum murders.

539
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,669
Edmond robberies?

540
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,266
Over there, you?
Nothing? Nothing?
Wow, really.

541
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:40,709
What, do you guys
live in this room?

542
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,178
(ALL LAUGHING)

543
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:47,150
So, you can
know stuff about me
just by looking at me?

544
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,582
Yeah, pretty much.

545
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,177
Do it.
Do it?

546
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,185
Go ahead, show us.

547
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,423
Looking for a little demo.

548
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,983
Well, for one,
they don't like pineapple.

549
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,653
(ALL LAUGHING)

550
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,960
I don't know guys. I don't
think Big T wants us
to take up any more...

551
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,863
Oh, no, no, no.
Go right ahead.

552
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,664
Half the lines are down,
phones are being worked on
right now.

553
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,762
We have time
for your little trick.
Oh, yeah?

554
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,774
Let's see what I
can come up with.

555
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:28,251
Loose flowing stanzas,
Bobby Frost.

556
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,253
Are you a poet, by chance?

557
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,728
Yeah! Yeah, I am!

558
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:33,821
(ALL GASPING)

559
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,491
Wow. How did you know that?

560
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,536
I guess you could say
I'm a bit of a psychic poet.

561
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,262
Oh, please, stop.

562
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,975
'Cause I'm like,
I'm freaking out here!

563
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,238
Do you see his eyeliner?

564
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,303
Guy could be the drummer
from The Cure.

565
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:58,720
Wow, I can see why
you come out here to eat.
It's beautiful.

566
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,821
Sound of the seagulls,
the smell of the ocean,
the salt air...

567
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,359
Hmm. I never noticed.

568
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:07,422
What do you got there?

569
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,693
What you asked for.

570
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,634
I ran the sheets
on all the volunteers
at the stress line.

571
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,437
Do you mind?
It's police business.

572
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,469
Scram.

573
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,078
Let's see what we got here.

574
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,378
Well, lookie there.

575
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,806
It's a picture
of an old friend.

576
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:26,873
Hmm.

577
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,289
Hey, Rory.

578
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,898
Where the hell
have you been?

579
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,334
I've been sitting
on this mop bucket

580
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,395
in this tiny closet
for the last hour and a half
waiting for you to show up.

581
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,906
I'm all cramped.
Well, get up, man.

582
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,170
Do some pushups or something.
I need you light and limber.

583
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:55,303
Do some pushups?
Sure, like Clint Eastwood
in <i>Escape from Alcatraz.</i>

584
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,247
Sure, he spends
the whole movie
in a tiny little cell, right?

585
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,750
But he's in the best shape
of his entire life.

586
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,817
Give me a little
piece of tape.

587
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,617
What happened to
the big ticking time clock?

588
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,090
Gus, what do you think
I've been doing all day?

589
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:16,466
My work happens here and here.

590
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,191
What are you doing?

591
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,301
I am trying to
create a pleasant
work environment.

592
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,275
I can tell by looking
at your little area
that you don't care.

593
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:26,435
We don't work here, Shawn.

594
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,808
We do until
we solve these murders.

595
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,346
But don't worry,
I have a plan.

596
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,939
You are gonna call
the stress line
and pretend to be depressed.

597
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,245
No, I'm not.
Yes.

598
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,149
And I will go down the hall
when you make the call,

599
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,245
ask for Rory, so that
I can see him in action.

600
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,414
Why don't you call him?

601
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,014
Gus, please be serious
for one second.

602
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:41,752
No one's gonna believe
that I'm depressed.
Come on.

603
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,021
I got an idea.
Why don't you have
the cat make the call?

604
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,620
He's like your new partner,
right? Where is he, anyway?

605
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,258
Gus, he's far more comfortable
in your car.

606
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,633
Plus, I need him
well rested for when
he identifies the killer.

607
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,470
Now, wait exactly two seconds
and then make the call.

608
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,675
Oh! I have no idea
what I'd even say.

609
00:27:58,743 --> 00:27:59,903
(SIGHS)

610
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,446
Here's a good opener.
"Hello, my name's Gus.

611
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,312
"I have a deep-seated jealousy
for a tiny little boy cat."

612
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,549
Why would you put them
on speakerphone?

613
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,453
See, because I think
that tends to undercut...

614
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,391
Big T! Look sharp!

615
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,429
What is it now, Mr. Spencer?

616
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,226
Just wanted to
pick your brain
for a second.

617
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,891
How many lines
you got going here?

618
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,902
I have 12 lines,
but I'm adding more
all the time.

619
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,064
I get it, I get it,
the more lines,
the more green, am I right?

620
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,337
I'm a non-profit operation.
The calls are free.

621
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,377
I'm not in this for the money.

622
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,845
Really, that's weird.

623
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,647
See,
I'm thinking of charging
four bucks a minute.

624
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,018
(SOFTLY) Rory.

625
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,454
Rory!

626
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,187
Hey, Ror.

627
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,395
Hey.
You really do love
your music, huh?

628
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,433
You kidding?
Music inspires me.

629
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,435
Yeah, you know,
you don't really strike me
as the...

630
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,934
Charitable type?
I was gonna say sensitive,
but sure.

631
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,236
Actually, I'm here as
part of a community service

632
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,209
on this assault beef,
you know.

633
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:10,213
I got into it with this guy
who didn't like my poetry.

634
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,647
So, 250 hours.

635
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,878
(PHONE RINGING)
Two-fifty, wow,
that's intense.

636
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,009
(GRUNTS)

637
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:20,252
Rory, that's Line 6!

638
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,290
I'll let you
get back to work.
Sorry.

639
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,765
Hello, Stressline,

640
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,529
the extra S is for
extra stress. This is Rory.

641
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,664
Uh-huh.

642
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,273
Right, so you're experiencing
some stress.

643
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,770
Career and personal?

644
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,144
Well, yeah, I suppose.

645
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,449
I mean my career's not exactly
where I would like it to be.

646
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,510
No. No, I don't have
a girlfriend right now.

647
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,922
It's been awhile.

648
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,385
Right.

649
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,056
Right, that's not good.

650
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,160
Does it make you
have dark thoughts?

651
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,167
Like how dark are you talking?

652
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:09,968
Like, "wanna be dead" dark?

653
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,134
Okay, easy,
I just wanna say this,

654
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,340
like, right off the bat,
suicide is not the answer.

655
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,177
Who said anything
about suicide?

656
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,979
I just said maybe I
should find a new hobby,
like coin collecting.

657
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:22,451
Or something
at the beach.

658
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,010
I like water activities.

659
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,282
Like drowning?

660
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,653
What? Drowning?

661
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,120
I don't want to drown!

662
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,786
No, no, of course you don't.

663
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,386
That's awful, okay?

664
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,897
But I don't care
what you say about

665
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,230
suicide in a lake
being poetic,

666
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,129
you know, like,
your body floating to the top

667
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,231
of the pristine, serene waters

668
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:45,674
<i>and your final breaths</i>
<i>rippling out in</i>

669
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,906
an ever-widening circle,
you know,
like the circle of life.

670
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,346
But you have to stop
that kind of thinking.

671
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,350
You have so much to live for.

672
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,784
You're damn straight,
I have a lot to live for!

673
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,253
Of course you do.

674
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,723
You see, I can tell,
this phone call is
helping you already.

675
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,191
(MOUTHING)

845
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,870
(SCREAMING)

846
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,711
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

847
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,249
That was adequate, Spencer.

848
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,850
Don't thank me.

849
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:25,895
Thank the little boy cat.

850
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,426
(GROANING)

851
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,160
There you are.

852
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,768
There's my big guy.

853
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,005
There's my big guy.
You are a hero.

854
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,307
You are a hero today. Yes.

855
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:47,011
Speaking of heroes, McNab,
I was gonna get you

856
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,118
something off
the registry online,

857
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,814
but it turns out
the Chief already got you
the asparagus steamer.

858
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,552
So, instead I give you
this little guy.

859
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,025
(MEOWING)

860
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:58,921
Yeah.

861
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:08,929
If you take him in the car,
he likes to ride upfront,
shotgun.

862
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,238
You know, there's
something beautiful

863
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,409
about the color
Fruity Puffs turns the milk.

864
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:24,318
I think it's
the most beautiful thing
in the whole world.

865
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,185
You know, I've been thinking.

866
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,248
You're not
the only one who lives
a charmed life, Shawn.

867
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:29,451
I got it pretty good, too.

868
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,394
Yes, you do,
and it makes me glad
to hear you say so.

869
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:34,192
I mean,
the other day at work,

870
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,563
this dermatologist,
Katie Finestatt,

871
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,602
commented how I
looked handsome

872
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,534
carrying my sample case
into her office.

873
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,299
Finestatt said that?
Yes, she did.

874
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,965
And she is fine.

875
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,672
So, it got me thinking,

876
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,976
maybe pharmaceutical sales
can be sort of sexy.

877
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,982
There are times
when I have to stand
a few feet away

878
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,574
because you're
literally sizzling.

879
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,643
You see what I'm saying?
I mean,

880
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,053
you may be my only
non-work friend,
but you're my best friend.

881
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,420
And how many best friends
does one guy need, really?

882
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:04,961
That's my point.

883
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,497
It's all in
the attitude, Gus.
Exactly.

884
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,328
Not sweating the small stuff.

885
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,825
Life is too short.

886
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,130
Too short.

887
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,564
Changing my attitude, Shawn.

888
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,311
Where the hell is my prize?

889
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,913
Where's my ring, Shawn?
Easy now.

890
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,180
No, no, I've timed
the bowls out perfectly,
Shawn.

891
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,950
Me, then you,
then me, then you,
then I get the prize!

892
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,823
What happened to
"Not sweating
the small stuff?

893
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,020
"Life's too short,"
all that?

894
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,663
Did you open
the bottom of the box?

895
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,858
Now, why would I do
something like that?

896
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,199
That's my ring.

897
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,699
You know I would kill
for that ring, don't you?

898
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,102
Oh, you're upsetting me.

899
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,142
You just changed
my mood from an orangey
yellow to a muddy brown.

900
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,370
You need to say
something sweet. Quick.

901
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,112
Gus!

902
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:02,515
That's so childish.

903
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,421
I'm gonna eat yours!

904
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:09,720
