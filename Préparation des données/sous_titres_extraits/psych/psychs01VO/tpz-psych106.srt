Isaac Newton,

00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:11,266
And how does that apply
to the nature of man?
Anyone? Shawn.

00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,039
You push, they push back.

5
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,205
Correct. Why?

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,305
Because man is
a stupid creature

7
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,351
who'd rather fight
than use his brain.

8
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,743
And what idiot said that?

9
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,047
BOTH: You did.

10
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,559
The name of the game
is survival, sports fans.

11
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,322
In order to survive,
you've got to fight.

12
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,261
And if you fight,
you better damn well win.

13
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:36,030
Because if you don't win,
and you don't use your brain,
then what happens? Gus?

14
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:37,126
You lose?

15
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,695
And for this troop,
that is not an option.
<i>Comprende?</i>

16
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:41,763
BOTH: Sir, yes, sir!

17
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:47,143
Because losing
is for lowlifes.
Losing is for quitters.

18
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:50,146
Are you boys lowlifes?
Are you boys quitters?

19
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,513

Gentlemen,
we are about to embark on

22
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:01,223

infamous Exercise Number 32,

the launching
of a solid fuel rocket.

24
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:07,391
Now, one of you lucky grunts
is gonna nab this thing

25
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,560
and you're gonna
haul ass back to me.

26
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,301
The prize?
A hot fudge sundae.

27
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:16,264
But if you lose?
What does the loser get,
Shawn?

28
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,809
He gets to
look on with envy.

29
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,903
That is correct.
He gets to look on with envy.

30
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:24,417
Because that, gentlemen,
is the American way.

37
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:03,915
A parachute.

38
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,516

Where's my rocket?

40
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,226
I thought he had it.

41
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:27,109

You took a shortcut!

42
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,980
A shortcut, huh?

43
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,315

The event isn't
until next weekend.

Yeah,
but this is the best part,

00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,177

Yes, it is.

that I wasn't going to
give any more notes.

But, guys, come on,
that last charge, it was...

How do I say this?

68
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,998
It was a
soul-sucking embarrassment

69
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,906

to wear the uniform.

about the bayonet gag, huh?

for a while.

It ended
Confederate Quantrill's plot
to assassinate Lincoln.

80
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:39,007
And it involved my

The cannon fired,
yet no Sally.

93
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,072
I got stuck
in the hospital tent.

94
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,574
Sergeant Menish had
a quick question
about his homeowner's policy.

95
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,203
How touching. However,
today you are not here
to sell insurance, Sally.

when the fifth cannon fires
you exit the hospital tent

99

and you shoot
Captain Quantrill
off his horse.

point your gun
at Captain Quantrill

and fire at
the prescribed moment,

106
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,404
the audience will not be
able to make heads nor tails
of what we are doing.

107

as if the evil

Inexplicably drawn
to the scene.

like a miracle.

a rainbow of flavors.

134
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,019

straight through his heart.

This was not
an accident, Detective!

how you know that,
and I don't give a rat's ass.

This case is personal.

00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,043
I wouldn't have gone
with something as traditional
as "we clear?"

You could've
gone foreign, right?

that this was not an accident
and do not make an arrest,

we will re-evaluate
at that time.

Pending the coroner's report,

162

I'd have to say
there are no indications
of foul play.

163
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:01,469
The general consensus is
that a live round got
mixed in with our blanks.

164
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,241
Mr. Mahoney is the
regiment's munitions expert
and jeweler,

As you know, Detective,
we had live-round
target practice

this past weekend.

169
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,316
Along with you,
we assumed a musket ball

170
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,220
got stuck
in one of our rifles,

171

laid there unseen,

172
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:23,824
and then a blank was inserted
during the last rehearsal...

173
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,298
Poor Nelson.
A terrible, terrible,
tragic accident.

174
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,234
The battles meant
so much to him.

175
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,502
Anyway,
this is an official
police investigation.

176
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,971
So let's focus
on our schematic
and nail down the specifics.

177
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,444
Detective O'Hara,
please.

178
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,502
Hey.

179
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,743
What's the deal,
why do you keep
staring at me?

180
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,981
One. It's our understanding

181
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,884
that the victim was shot
off his horse

182
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,389
at the top of
the creek bank here...

183
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,446
(GUNSHOT)

184
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,149
And then rolled

185
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:56,961
to the creek bed here.

186
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,926
Two.
We know Nelson was
facing west,

187
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,363
so we're gonna
focus our attentions here

188
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,594
on the opposite bank
where we assume
the shot originated.

189
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,094
Assume.

190
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,266
Detective?
Spencer?

191
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:12,300
What about three,
the missing bullet?

192
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,339
I saw it ripping
through Nelson's body,

193
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,383
in through the front,
out through the back.

194
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,715
And it still
hasn't been found.

195
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,314
Wait.
How do you know all that?

196
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,482
Lassy,
you wanna take this one?

197
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,049
He had an "episode"
in the hallway.

198
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,595
Look,
I can handle this myself.

199
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,161
Nelson, Nelson, you're going
to have to speak up.
You're teeny!

200
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,000
You were shot
through the heart?

201
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,167
Now, that was
privileged information!

202
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,298
I didn't say anything.

203
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,434
(SHUSHING)
Are you sure about this?

204
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,707
It's bold,
but I'll run with it.

205
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:54,013
He says people don't get
shot through the heart
by accident.

206
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,290
He says he was murdered.

207
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:00,583
You're hired.

208
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:04,918
You told them what?

209
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,329
Gus, she was hot,
and she was dressed
as a nurse.

210
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,697
You know
how I feel about that.

211
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,327
Oh, come on,
what was I supposed to do,
not impress her?

212
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,568
Plus, the tiny figurine made
a very convincing argument.

213
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,006
I don't know how
you're gonna prove murder
with two lousy bullet holes.

214
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:21,012
Oh, relax. I did some
checking on Nelson Poe,
nobody liked him.

215
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,148
Ever.
And second of all...

216
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,342
What?

217
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,616
Dude, I don't have
a second of all.

218
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,124
And we know Nelson was
on top of the ridge,
facing the Union soldiers

219
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,386
over here when he was shot.
So Schwartz, take Team A,

220
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,484
check out that high grass.

221
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,257
O'Hara, take Team B,
start going over the ridge.

222
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:42,956
Do it.

223
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,091
MEN: Yes, sir.

224
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:45,993
(CHUCKLING)

225
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,505
Find something amusing?

226
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,135
Mildly amusing.
More odd.

227
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,702
Delightful,
in a queer sort of way.

228
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,174
For your edification,
the reenactment
of the battles...

229
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,341
Edification?

230
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,046
Yeah, edification.

231
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,714
Is that legal?
Like, in public.
Public edification's legal?

232
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,017
It means
for your information...

233
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,581
Why didn't you
just say that?

234
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,651
For your edification,
the reenactment of battles,

235
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,721
battles fought
by our forefathers
to preserve this Union,

236
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,459
is a sacred trust.

237
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,333
What are you guys
doing here, anyway?

238
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,630
I'm a bit of
a Civil War buff.

239
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,136
I'm reading the dirt.

240
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,036
The trees.
The hot dog stand.

241
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,473
No real information there,
but they do great sauerkraut.

242
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,703
I may even be able to
help you name a suspect.

243
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:29,009
Look, I told you,
we're 95% sure this was
an accidental shooting.

244
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,548
What about the other 5%?

245
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,811
If I am wrong,
we will hold
a press conference,

246
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,786
you two will be
cordially invited to
say "I told you so."

247
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:40,924
Seems fair. Hey...
Can I wear your face wig?

248
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,760
What are you doing?

249
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,325
Shockingly,
Lassiter is holding out on us.

250
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,266
I do not think that he thinks
that this was an accident.

251
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,634
What do you mean?

252
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,472
I saw three names checked off
the roster on his clipboard.

253
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,738
What names?

254
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,110
Gus,
I thought you'd never ask.

255
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,508
What is this?
The battlefield.

256
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,003
Based on what?
The briefing room board
at the police station.

257
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,776
You did this from memory?
Yes.

258
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,578
You said you saw it
for two minutes.

259
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,586
Right, two whole minutes.

260
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,210
You got problems.

261
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,781
Factoid!
The musket is accurate
from 30 yards.

262
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,323
Poe.

263
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,822
G.C.

264
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,889
G. C?

265
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,597
George Cheslow.

266
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,868
George Cheslow?
From sixth grade?

267
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:03,931
Little Georgie!

268
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,636
He's, like, a dentist now.

269
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,976
Really?

270
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,376
See you in six months.

271
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,578
We go in,
we check it out.

272
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,950
See if George Cheslow had
any reason to murder somebody.

273
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,784
Pop out.

274
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,382
Mr. Guster.
The dentist will see you now.

275
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,949
Sweet.
Whoa!

276
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,463
Me? My teeth are gorgeous.
You said the appointment
was for you.

277
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,499
Right.
For me to do
some snooping.

278
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,932
Because I'm
a much better snooper
than you are.

279
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,026
You just keep him occupied.

280
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,365
Occupied how?

281
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,867

Gus, stop it. Be a man.

283
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,744
What's he saying?
He says his teeth
are gorgeous.

284
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,180
I'm sorry, Shawn, but
the reason you have to
be here, too, is?

285
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:53,385
George, Gus has phobias.
And being alone in
a dentist chair is one.

286
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,852
He could snap at any moment.

287
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,326
This is actually
for your own protection.

288
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,226
Last time
he bit off an index finger.

289
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:02,255
Thankfully, I was there.
They were able to save
everything but the nail.

can I talk to you
for a minute?

Oh, sure.
Gentleman, duty calls.

293
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,386
Oh, and the credit card
won't go through.

having an affair with Poe?

00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,985
You said
it was an accident.

344
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,185
We discovered
a stack of love letters
at Nelson's house

345
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,751
indicating he was having
an affair with your wife

346
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,456
and that you had
threatened to kill him.

347
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,228
(SCOFFING)
Oh, come on.

348
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,965
I am so disappointed in you.

349
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,173
All right.
Okay, okay, okay.

350
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,309
(MUMBLING)
You got the wrong man.

351
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,008
What did he say?

352
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,081
You've got the wrong man.

353
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,518
First, I told you so.

354
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,957
Secondly, I think
George Cheslow is
an innocent man.

355
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,359
Yeah, you know, he's right.
We do have a paper-thin case.

356
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,954
I mean, all we've got is
motive, means and opportunity.

357
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,626
Look, guys.
I had a dream last night.

358
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,899
I was sipping iced wine
with a baby tree monkey.

359
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,871
And I fell and I landed
in a wooded area.

360
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,273
And that's where
I saw Nelson Poe get shot.

361
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:35,780
Only, in my dream,
the shooter was much closer
than I originally thought.

362
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,148
This is a minie ball,
am I right?

363
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,617
Where did you get this?
Your desk.

364
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:45,680
Now, it's common knowledge
that minie balls cause huge
gaping holes in human flesh

365
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,850
which leads to
a quandary in my dream.

366
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:51,760
Why was Nelson Poe's
exit wound so small?

367
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,695
If George Cheslow had been
in that wooded area,

368
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:59,225
he was way too far
to make a shot that caused
such a little hole.

369
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,398
Whoever shot Nelson was
much, much closer.

370
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,841
And this "whoever" would be...

371
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,173
Engelbert Humperdinck.

372
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,474
So you've got nothing.

373
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,777
Thank you for the random
speculation. Goodbye.

374
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:14,341
Mr. Spencer, if you can't
name names, I'm afraid
he's right this time.

375
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,512
Fine, I'll get you a name.

376
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,151
And I'm gonna
get you a woman.

377
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,853
"Afraid he's right"?
"This time"?

378
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:32,303
It's a gift, actually,
for my son.
A surprise of sorts.

379
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:37,572
This way he, my son,
will be able to keep track
of time for a change.

380
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,305
Kid was late at birth,
he's been late ever since.

381
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:44,907
Now, he is going to have
a gold pocket watch
just like mine.

382
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,249
I've had mine for 30 years.

383
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,085
I see. Now, the inscription.
What would you like it to say?

384
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,990
"Shawn,

385
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,756
"don't lose this watch,
Henry Spencer."

386
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,318
Spencer.

387
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:01,991
What, too much?

388
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:06,663
No, no. It's just that
your son is no doubt familiar
with your last name.

389
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,397
It might contradict
the sentiment.

390
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,308
All right,
what would you suggest?

391
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,810
"Love, Dad"?

392
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:20,140
"Love, Dad." Well,
why don't you just put
"Kissy, kissy"?

393
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,449
Right, too mushy.
No problem.

394
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,785
So, before we go any further,
let's see.

395
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,689
Vintage gold pocket watch.
Gold chain.

396
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,718
Taxes and engraving,
comes to a total of...

397
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,064
Wait, wait, wait.

398
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,967
Where's my discount?
I'm ex-cop.
Half the regiment's cop.

399
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,629
I thought we agreed on $<i>4</i>00.

400
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,971
Oh, yes, we did.
But at $<i>4</i> per engraved letter,

401
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,977
that adds a total of $210.

402
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:52,005
All right, take away "Shawn,"
"this watch", "Spencer."

403
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,116
How much does
that come out to?

404
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,219
$56 for the engraving
plus tax,

405
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,690
$<i>4</i>60 even.

406
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,557
And what does
the revised inscription read?

407
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,824
"Don't lose, Henry."

408
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,329
Clean, to the point.
I like it.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

410
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:12,692
Come in.

411
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,869
Mr. Guster, I know
you said you didn't want
to be interrupted,

412
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,738
but there is a Lieutenant
Crunch here to see you.

413
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,003
Crunch?

414
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,840
Actually, I've been promoted.

415
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,169
It's Captain Crunch.

416
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,648
Thank you.

417
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,717
Not in a thousand years.

418
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,052
Dude, we're joining
that regiment.
No, we are not.

419
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,388
They're down to 30 guys.
Please,
I have a meeting in...

420
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,926
And this mystery is
still wide open.

421
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:39,088
Gus, think about it.
Camping out under the stars.

422
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:44,659
Living history.
Eating beans and rotten meat
with men who reek of valor.

423
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,169
There's just one thing
you haven't considered

424
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,263
in this perfect scenario
of yours, Shawn.

425
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,671
That's not true.
I've considered everything.

426
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:53,199
Really?
And what role would I play
in this production of yours?

427
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:54,506
I don't... What do you...

428
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,069
What role would I play

429
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,740
in the midst of
all those hardcore

430
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,910

Civil War re-enactors?

431
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,786
Would I be...
No.

432
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,220
Gus, no.

433
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,316
Okay, then maybe would I be...
Never.

434
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,686
Who are you talking to?
You're talking to me.
This is me.

435
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,662
Then what, Shawn?
What would I be?

436
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:17,168
Because I tell you, there is
no way, no way, that I would
ever, never ever...

437
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,069
May I please tell you
what I was thinking?

438
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,230
What?

439
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,799
I was thinking <i>Glory.</i>

440
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,940
I was thinking Denzel.

441
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,077
Did you just say Denzel?
As in Denzel Washington?

442
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,780
No, the other Denzel.

443
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,411
Of course.
And we'll put you
on a horse,

444
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,183
and we'll give you
your own sword.

445
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,848
You're gonna have
a chestful of medals.

446
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:43,190
You can be
anything you want.
You can be a pilot.

447
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,491
The Air Force wasn't
formed until World War I.

448
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,725
That's fair.
So you can't be a pilot.

449
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:51,132
Look, I called Mr. Mahoney,
he's Mr. Uniform,

450
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,502
and I told him to make you
something spectacular.

451
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,235
Denzel Washington.

452
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,949
Captain Mahoney, you said
we needed recruits? <i>Voilà.</i>

453
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:11,519
Welcome aboard, son.
I didn't expect you
back so soon.

454
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,058
Don't know if
the uniforms are ready yet.

455
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,957
But it is spectacular?

456
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,757
You saw <i>Glory?</i>
This is the best we had.

457
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,161
Well, come along.

458
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,722
I told you.

459
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,898
GUS: Wow, Captain,
it's quite an establishment
you've got here.

460
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,768
My sanctum sanctorum.

461
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:37,114
Fine jewelry, yes.
Even my vintage
pocket watch collection.

462
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:41,141
But above all, the finest
Civil War memorabilia

463
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,653
and props
west of the Mississippi.

464
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:47,883
I can attest to that.
I've repaired
nearly half of them.

465
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:51,986
Sally. I am so happy
to see you,

466
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,964
though I'm a little
disappointed you're not
wearing your nurse's uniform.

467
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:58,002
Griffin called me, frantic,
saying we needed
one more outfit.

468
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,127
You okay with that?

469
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,832
I sure am. It's just a shame
you didn't dress me.

470
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,704
Still time for that.

471
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,344
Aside from reenacting,

472
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,936
Sally insures
half the regiment.

473
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,778
Auto policies, homeowners.
Even theft.

474
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,876
Speaking of which,
Griff, I'm thinking
of insuring my legs.

475
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,580
Sort of like Mary Hart.

476
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,681
What do you think,
three, five million a haunch?

477
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,283
Keep in mind my calves are
like carved marble.

478
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,920
That's not the kind
of policy she writes.

479
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,327
So she wrote yours?

480
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,528
Of course. And it's worth
more than both your legs
put together.

481
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,965
Does that policy include
plastic explosives?

482
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:38,576
'Cause I see
that you're packing C-<i>4</i>.
Is this authentic?

483
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,076
Better yet,
is it even legal?

We fudge the fireworks
sometimes.

showers them with dirt.

Sorry. Sorry.
The battlefield can be
pretty messy at times.

492
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,335
What about these jars
with the buttons in them?

493
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,936
For the super hardcores.
They soak their brass
in urine.

to try this thing on?

00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,450
Sure.

509
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,932
Let's go somewhere dark.
You can give me
a history lesson.

510
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:28,514
Captain Quantrill,
he's the guy that burned
down the abolitionist town?

511
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,885
Lawrence, Kansas, 1863.

512
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,652
A year later
they were hell-bent
on assassinating Lincoln.

513
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,990
But Lassiter's great-
great-granddad, Muscum,

514
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,121
he stopped 'em cold
on the bridge, yeah?

515
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,859
Sort of like
a noble calling, right?

516
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,298
Something like that.

517
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,835
And the nurse you portray,
who's that?

518
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:45,892
Jenny Winslow.

519
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,405
She lost her husband
and two sons at Lawrence.

520
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,271
She wanted revenge,
and she got it.

521
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:57,079
And what about you,
Sally Reynolds?

522
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,082
What do you want?

523
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,778
Shouldn't you already know?

524
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,022
Why, because I'm psychic?

525
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,058
My aunt used to think
she was a psychic.

526
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,990
She got predictions wrong
all the time.

527
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,620
Then she'd get the smallest
random detail right,

528
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,290
and she'd say, "You see?"

529
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,434
So, what you're saying is
that you doubt me?

530
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,803
That hurts my feelings.

531
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:25,533
Well, you still haven't
guessed what I want.

532
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,181

540
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:15,484
The truth, Shawn,
you're not really my son,
are you?

541
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,788
Because I gave you
a watch with the inscription
"Don't lose."

542
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,456
And what is
the first thing that you do?

543
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,592
I lose the watch.
You lose the watch!

Yeah, well, here's
a newsflash for you, kid.

547
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,200

it took you four months
to smile at me.

That's when the clock
started ticking.

549

Look, Shawn, I appreciate
this newfound respect
that you've got for time,

550
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,614
but what the hell
are you doing out here
in the boonies

All right, look,
this case of yours, I...

556
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,334
I've been thinking
about it and...

557
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:04,966
Really?

558
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,170
What? No,
I haven't been "thinking."

559
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:12,414
Look, killing your wife's
lover is something
that's rarely planned.

00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,576
It usually just happens.

561
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:17,052
So even if this dentist
Cheslow did plan it,

562
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,852
he's not gonna be some
numb nuts hanging around
waiting for love letters

563

that're gonna point the cops
in his direction, right?

Exactly. He's not gonna hang
around like a numb nuts.

565

I think Nelson rolled
into this creek

right up there.

Right on my ass.

is find the missing bullet.

679
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,639
Just take a deep breath.
Okay.

680
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,677
GUS: I don't think these
dresses were intended to fit
over a bulletproof vest.

681
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,236
Remember, we will be
out there watching.
Got you.

682
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,748
To catch the bad guy
before you get shot.
I understand.

683
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,513
But just in case,
I want you to bob left,
weave right.

684
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,713
Traditional bob and weave,
no reason to get fancy
out there.

685
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:51,777
And don't become
an easy target.

686
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,186
I did go to
the academy.

687
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,781
Or you could die.

688
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:55,917
Right.

689
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,392
Now remember, the fifth
cannon boom is your cue

690
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,759
to shoot whoever's
playing Quantrill.

691
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,627
SHAWN: Right. Wait,
how do you know that?

692
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,029
GUS: I read the manual.
Didn't you?

693
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,658
I didn't open the manual,
it was like <i>War and Peace.</i>

694
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,326
There were 17 chapters.
It's the manual, Shawn.

695
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,461
It was this thick...
JULIET: Hey.

696
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,004
Hey.
GUS: Sorry.

697
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:11,769
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
All about you right now.
All right, you're a champion.

698
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,834
Now go out there
and catch us a killer.

699
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:16,505
Juliet, please be careful.

700
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,105
And don't die.

701
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,509
SHAWN: How many times
you gonna say die?
Shawn, just get...

702
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,019
You're putting
the word "die" into her head.
She knows there's a killer!

703
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,076
JULIET: Guys?
Yeah?

704
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,452
A favor.
Sure! Name it.

705
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,183
Kick me.

706
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:28,856
Do what?

707
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,754
Kick me!
SHAWN: Okay!

708
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,361
(GUNS FIRING)

709
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,966
Now what?

710
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,600
Now we get ready
to find a killer.

711
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,074
(MEN SHOUTING)

712
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:02,121
SHAWN: Here it comes.
The moment of truth.

713
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,033
GUS: Where's our killer?

714
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,743
That's weird. Nobody came.

715
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:26,173
Well, at least Juliet
is out of danger now.

716
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,410
SHAWN: What?

717
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,053
Well, I wonder
where this leads.

718
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,710
Watch your head.

719
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,645
Oh, did you get sewage
on your feather?

720
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,451
We've crossed
to the other side
of the creek bed.

721
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,718
Yeah, the police accounted
for all of the Union soldiers.

722
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:11,660
But nobody's considered
that the murderer could have
come from this side.

723
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,196
After all, this was
the bad side, right?

724
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,290
You know that's right.

725
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,242
May I ask, who goes out
on the battlefield
without their boots?

726
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,709
Maybe someone has bunions.

727
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,008
Bunions, Gus? Really?
That's what you're bringing
to the table?

728
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,378
I'm trying to solve
a murder here.

729
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,076
I deal with bunions
at work every day, Shawn.

730
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,708
They hurt...
They hurt people.

731
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,047
That's a perfectly
logical assumption.

732
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,248
Oh, yeah?
What about this?
No tunic.

733
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,687
This is Mahoney's!

734
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,020
What?

735
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,293
The brass button.

736
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,861
(WHISPERING)
Mahoney did it.

737
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,075
That's why he had
that sticky musket.

738
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,611
He must've gotten sap on it
from that notch in the tree.

739
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,615
Wait. This doesn't track.
Why kill Sally? She's hot,
they're friends.

740
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:06,945
She even wrote
his insurance policy.

741
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,781
(EXPLODING)

742
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,320
That was C-<i>4</i>!

743
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:13,079
That didn't come
from the battlefield,
it came from the south.

744
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:15,416
I solved the crime.
No, I did.

745
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,551
I said it first.
I identified the uniform.

746
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,118
I found the button near
the tree. I said it first.
Tap, tap, no take-backs.

747
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,663
That's not fair, Shawn.
I was identifying
the C-<i>4</i> sound.

748
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:23,666
Dude, you snooze
you lose, Gus.
I don't have to tell you.

749
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,233
That manhole we found
connects to the sewer.

750
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,068
It's going to lead us right
to our killer. Let's go.

751
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,198
We're going in by ourself?

752
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:31,741
What, are you crazy?

753
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,748
Where you going, Mahoney?
Hey, Griff!

754
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,656
Hello, boys.

755
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,929
Back off. Back off.

756
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:57,897
Back off. This gun is loaded.

757
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,936
(GUNS COCKING)

758
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,895
Yes, but mine are
so much bigger.

759
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:04,801
CARLTON: Get out of the way,
I'm coming through.

760
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,537
What the hell is
going on down here?

761
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,806
Colonel,

762
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,144
arrest this traitor.

763
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,078
I'll have that weapon,
Captain.

764
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:28,157
Okay, hold on,
I'm gonna need you
to walk me through this.

765
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,927
Mahoney blew up
his own vault?

766
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,833
MAHONEY: That is an absolutely
outrageous...
Shut up!

767
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:35,030
Not only did he blow it up,

768
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,740
he used the battle as a cover
to rob his own store.

769
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:41,300
Then, he'd collect a multi-
million dollar insurance
policy in a couple of weeks,

770
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,540
then slip back
to the battle
during the cannon fire

771
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:46,174
with no one ever
being the wiser.

772
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:52,088
Oh, ye immoral
man of low fiber!

773
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,555
You should really
eat more bran.

774
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:54,989
I want to see my lawyer.

775
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,583
In due time.

776
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,152
Wait, but I still
don't understand.
Why kill Nelson Poe?

777
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,358
That is the rub, isn't it?

778
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,799
Sally Reynolds was
the intended target.

779
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,860
The question is why?

780
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,105
Hi, Juliet.
Got your message.

781
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,300
What the hell is going on?

782
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,899
Oh, I can see it
clearly now.

783
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,639
Sally wrote Mahoney's
multi-million dollar
insurance policy.

784
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,237
That means she...

785
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,482
She was in on the fraud
from the start.

786
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,984
That's a lie.

787
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,818
But Mahoney here didn't want
to share those millions,
so he gets an idea.

788
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,415
What if sweet, sweet Sally
with the filthy mouth

789
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,926
and the bedroom eyes
had a little accident

790
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,327
out on the battlefield
during the rehearsal?

791
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,627
You mean Griffin tried
to kill me?
That's right.

792
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,860
This is a lie.
You are fabricating
everything you're saying.

793
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,266
Now you hold on a second,
Mr. Mahoney.

794
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:42,703
Oh, hey, Gus, you see,
when Nelson rolled
down the creek bed

795
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,468
<i>and landed too close</i>
<i>to the river, he looked up</i>

796
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,340
<i>and he saw Griffin</i>
<i>in the tree with his trusty</i>
<i>musket, who said,</i>

00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:50,869
"Griffin, now you must
kill Nelson Poe

798
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,883
"to keep his
stinking mouth shut."

799
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:55,917
Told you you had
the wrong person, Lassiter.

800
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,180
I know.

801
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:01,518

Lose the hoop skirt
before you hurt someone.

and book ' em.

CARLTON: Excuse me, gentlemen.

804
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:12,093
Hey, it was good work,
Detective. We got 'em.

805
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,193
"We"?

806
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,067
We're a team, right?

807
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:27,649
SHAWN: Gus. When we grow up,
think I'll ever be
as cool as you?

808
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,186
You're better at kickball.

809
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,778
Not what I asked.

810
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:33,750
We talking about
your dad again?

811
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,291
Mmm-hmm.

812
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,884
Come on, dude.
The guy respects you.

813
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,429
Not like he does you.

814
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,691
I'm not his son.

815
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:43,858
I mean, he might like me okay,
but he loves you.

816
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:46,167
Did he say that?

817
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,670
No.

818
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,797
Then how can you be sure?

819
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,399
You mean he's never said it?

820
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,808
Come on, Gus. We're guys.

821
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,252
