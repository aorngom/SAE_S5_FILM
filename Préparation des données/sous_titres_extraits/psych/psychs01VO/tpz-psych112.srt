it's not that I...

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:13,507
Shawn, those people aren't
just watching the trial.
Those people are the trial.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,070
They're the jurors,

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,412
and they're the most
important people in this room.

6
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:18,576
They are?

7
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:21,176
The thing about
the jury is, Shawn,

8
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:24,280
you gotta learn
how to look at them,
how to read them.

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,418
For instance, take a look
at juror number five.

10
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,986
He's the guy in the front row,
second one from the left.

11
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,555
Tell me what you see. Go.

12
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,826
Brown shirt,
little hole in his collar.

13
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,599
His coat is too tight on him.

14
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:43,768
He's got rough hands,
he's looking down mostly
and nodding a lot.

15
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,333
Good, good.

16
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,437
All right, let's take
that hole in his collar.

17
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,982
Now, would Mom ever
let you leave the house
looking like that?

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,108
Never.

19
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,276
You believe it.

20
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:56,015
So, that tells us that
he's probably not married.

21
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,319
That's called
deductive reasoning.

22
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,555
LAWYER: Your Honor,
the people call Detective
Henry L. Spencer to the stand.

23
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,029
All right, watch closely, kid.

24
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,030
One day you're gonna walk up
the steps of this courthouse

25
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,625
and you're gonna make
your old man proud.

26
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,827
Gus, they impounded
my motorcycle without warning.

27
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,874
I'm pretty sure the warning
was the $900 worth of
parking tickets you racked up.

28
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,171
Still, man, you can't take
a man's means
of transportation away.

29
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,471
It's, like, unconstitutional
or something.

30
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,876
I'm pretty sure
it's not in the Constitution.

31
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,106
Oh, don't be so sure.

32
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,150
I think it says, "Thou shalt
not something,
or covet something.

33
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:27,015
"Don't mess with Texas
or the right
of transportation."

34
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,111
You're thinking
of a commandment.

35
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,553
That's even better.
Can we just pay this ticket

36
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:30,850
so we can get out
of here, please?

37
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,892
You gotta be kidding me.
We came all the way over here,

38
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,290
and now you're not
gonna wait in the line?

39
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,294
Gus, did you see it in there?
It's a ticket payment line,

40
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,954
not Space Mountain.
Hardly worth it.

41
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,295
Plus, I don't wait in lines.
What do you mean
you don't wait in lines?

42
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:43,494
Everyone waits in lines.
That's what we do as people,
we wait in lines.

43

of the scorpion and the frog?

They're both on the riverbank.
The scorpion's like, "Hey"...

47
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,318
The point is I shouldn't
have gotten any tickets, Gus.

48
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,329
I was using
my ambassador plates.

49
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,797

You're not
an ambassador, Shawn.

50
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,801
Impersonating
a government official
will land you in jail.

51

Gus, I'm getting
a very strong feeling here.

75
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,998
I think that woman
is innocent.

76
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,399
I do watch the news,
and I've been
following this case.

77
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,494
They have a mountain
of evidence against this lady.

78
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,164
Look, they call her
the "School Marm Murderer."

79
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,834
Okay, first of all,
there's a question mark
at the end of that.

80
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,810
They call her the
"School Marm Murderer?"

81
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,471
Even the news people
aren't convinced.

82
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,414
And today at the courthouse,
in the middle
of a conversation,

83
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,384
I saw her bend over
and pick up a piece of trash!

84
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,286
Oh, I see.
So because she picks up
somebody's KitKat wrapper

85
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,847
means she didn't kill anybody?
That makes sense.

86
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,325
Gus, she didn't
have to do that.

87
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,453
The woman is about to be
on trial for her life.

88
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,293
She takes time out
for common courtesy?

89
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:56,062
That is not the mindset
of a cold-blooded murderer.
No!

90
00:03:56,135 --> 00:04:00,333

She looked at me
right in the eyes.

91

that people have

to appear not guilty.

and I haven't even
gone up yet.

162
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,959
Here's the thing.
She's a fashion maven.

163
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,190
She has a problem
with your appearance,

164
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:48,062
and until you change it,
I don't think she's gonna
listen to a word you say.

165
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,159
My appearance?
The manner in which
you appear.

166
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,225
Your look.

167
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,499
I don't know exactly
what the problem is,
but let's check it out.

168
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,803
Why don't you give me the...
Give me the 360 cat dance
real fast, huh?

169
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:56,899
(CLAPS)

170
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,173
Excuse me?
Just twirl it up for me,
and then twirl it right back.

171
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,237
(SCOFFS)
There it is. And back.

172
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,478
Suit, pleated. I would have
gone with a three button,

173
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,540
maybe something
in a wool-cotton blend,

174
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,813
but I don't think
that's the problem.

175
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,186
Sideburns? Check.
Hair, bold,
Strokes, Hives.

176
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,451
I don't think
that's the problem.

177
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,993
The shoes, not a spit shine,
but like you said,
you haven't gotten up yet,

178
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,586
so I can't make
heads or... Whoa!

179
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,392
What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

180
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,524
I think it's the tie.
What? My tie?

181
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,593
What's wrong with my tie?
Well, it's a little bit...

182
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,374
Well, look, it's not
like my favorite tie...

183
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,071
I'm so glad
to hear you
say that.

184
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,134
Gus?
What?

185
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,181
(WHISPERING) Quick,
give me your tie.
I'm not giving you my tie.

186
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,273
It's a good tie!
Give me your tie, please.

187
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,376
It's a Thomas Pink tie.
One second.

188
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,953
Why don't you
give me the tie?
Just once will you...

189
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,081
Come on, Shawn!

190
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,323
Look high, reach low.
Got it.

191
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,259
Now, we're also
going to take this.

192
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,354
Primarily because
it's covered in sweat,

193
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,661
but also because it reads
cruise ship waiter to me.

194
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,827
Cruise ship?
Go get 'em!

195
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,701
And so, I will demonstrate
to the court

196
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:07,041
that Sandra Panitch
is an upstanding citizen
with no criminal record,

197
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:11,709
and the district attorney
has rushed to the prosecution
of an innocent woman.

198
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,820
Are you finished now,
Mr. Hornstock?

199
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,414
Hmm? Ah! Oh, yes.
Yes, Your Honor.

200
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,151
Brilliant.

201
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,557
Well, things are
finally moving along.

202
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,893
Court will recess
till after lunch.

203
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,301
Did you see that?
That was amazing!
Did you see that?

204
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,394
That was a whole 180!

205
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:33,665
Well, it's a pretty
amazing tie.

206
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,140
Hey, strong shag,
strong tie,
strong person.

207
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,176
You know, guys,
I would hire you in a second.
It's just...

208
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,812
Well, I, I don't
have the authorization.

209
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,751
My firm doesn't really
believe in...

210

No.

No.

212
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,984

No, me.

213
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,357
Yeah, at least not anymore.

214
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,588
No, there's no buts here.

A lot of the cases
my partner Gus and I take,
we do for free.

216
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,730
It's called <i>pro bono.</i>

217
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,892
Gus?
What?

218
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,766
A little decorum,
we're in a courtroom.

219
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:08,830
Congratulations,
you got yourself a couple
of legal consultants.

220
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,704
Wow.
Oh, boy.

221
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,147
Did he just grab your fist?
And then he shook it.

222
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:18,149
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

223
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,275
Hi, Jules.

224
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,513
Please tell me you're not
one of those
courtroom groupies

225
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,782
that bounces
from trial to trial?

226
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,723
Wait a second, was that you
at the Michael Jackson hearing

227
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,623
with the sequined glove
and the shirt that said,

228
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,185
"Please free the man
in the mirror"?

229
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,821
That's actually
really funny, Shawn.

230
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:36,994
Detective Lassiter is the one
who actually made
the arrest of Sandra Panitch.

231
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,798
See, that makes it my case.

232
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,806
What a coincidence.
It's also our case.

233
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:45,503
Yeah, we just signed on
as legal consultants
to the defense just now.

234
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:50,038
And you will sell your little
sideshow act to anyone
who'll listen, won't you?

235
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,380
Just don't screw this one up.

236
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,776
"Don't screw this up"?

237
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,356
Hey, Lassy, that really
wasn't much of a put down.

238
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,690
In fact it was
somewhat inspiring.

239
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,621
Las, let's roll that back!

240
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,531
I don't know.
It feels a little weird.

241
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,600
I mean, you should really
be sitting here.
This is your office.

242
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,643
Yeah, this isn't my office.

243
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,441
You didn't like mine.
This is Carter Jarecki's
office, one of the partners.

244
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,642
Actually, he's the guy
who took the case
in the first place,

245
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,743
but then dumped it on me
when he decided
it was a lost cause.

246
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,845
You see, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

247
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,651
Why didn't you stand up
to that guy?

248
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,490
For the worst reason possible.
I actually believe
this woman is innocent.

249
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,724
(SIGHING) Now, can we please
go before Jarecki gets back?

250
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,160
Carter Jarecki just left for
a nooner with his mistress.
We have at least two hours.

251
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,335
Maybe an hour and a half.

252
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,380
Hornstock, I think
you have the potential
to be a fantastic lawyer.

253
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:59,179
You just need confidence.
After all, that's your name
on the door. Now come on!

254
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:02,687
Oh, no. No. None of those
Hornstocks are me.

255

The first one
is my grandfather,
he founded the firm.

256
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,826
The other one is my father,
then my brother.

257
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,726
Wow. A whole
family of lawyers?

258
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,731
Yeah, even my sister.

259
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,393
Well, there you go.
She didn't make the door.

260
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,404
She's Biederman.
It's her married name.

261
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,298
Well, we're gonna need
to take a look
at your witness list

262
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,808
and your deposition
transcripts.

263
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,141
Oh, yeah. Well, I prepared
all that for you.

264
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,649
I have... Here are
all the forensic
and arrest reports.

265
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:34,482
And I deposed several
of Hale's coworkers
from Channel 8,

266
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,989
mostly to refute timelines
and for character testimony.

And maybe, later on
we can read the phonebook,
just for fun.

272
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:53,168
Hornstock, I've gotta do
what I do.

273
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,166
That's not the way I do it.

274
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,404
I need to see,
feel and smell people

275
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,638
in order to figure out
what happens.

276
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,108

to have a look around,

you do.

shall we?
Yeah.

282
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,634
He probably came in from
that same entrance we did.
Right.

283
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:28,799
Found their way over here
to the Channel 8

284
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:32,674
Of course, the body
was found here.

285
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,877
It was a short walk.
Yeah.

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,596
RUBEN: Was.

324
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,697
I was just sorting and packing

325
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,711
some of his more
important things
to send to his family.

326
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,375
It's the least I can do.

327
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,539
That's very thoughtful.

328
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,673
Thank you.

329
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,809
<i>That reminds me</i>
<i>of a hot, little</i>
señorita <i>I met there.</i>

330
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,352
<i>She was serving</i>
<i>fried jalapenos...</i>

331
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,648
Would you excuse me?
Sure.

332
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,881
Sure.
Thanks.

333
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,881
<i>HALE: So,</i>
<i>if you'll notice that...</i>

334
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,119
Did you work
with Jackson Hale long?

335
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,390
Six years. He was a great man.

336
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,924
I had a lot
of respect for him.

337
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,132
He was just so good
at what he did.

338
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,003
<i>Take your umbrella</i>
<i>because I guarantee,</i>

339
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,635
<i>it's raining cats and dogs</i>
<i>out there.</i>

340
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,508
A broadcasting treasure.

341
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,741
<i>Anyway,</i>
<i>take a look</i>
<i>at Thursday here...</i>

342
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,044
(WHISPERING) Dude,

343
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,417
Ruben's in there
destroying Hale's awards.

344
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,550
What?
Yeah.

345
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,425
Unless he's really
offended by the shoddy
engraving on the plaque,

346
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:10,332
that guy hates Jackson Hale.
I'm not saying he did it,
but reasonable doubt, anyone?

347
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:19,268
Okay, Miss Panitch.
Please, walk us through
the night of the crime.

348
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,573
Well, I never met Mr. Hale
before that night.

349
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,879
I just moved here
from Wisconsin.

350
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,350
It wasn't like
I was a fan of his.

351
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,979
I only vaguely knew
he was a weatherman.

352
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,215
So we talked,
and he was charming...

353
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,816
So the scratches
on Jackson Hale's back

354
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,485
and his skin under
your the fingernails,

355
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,291
this all happened
during the sex,

356
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,298
as well as the bruises
on your arm?

357
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,493
It got passionate.

358
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,298
I don't remember anything
until I woke up
the next morning.

359
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,633
With his blood on you?

360
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,070
And then you fled
to the parking lot?

361
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,370
Look, I was scared.

362
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:54,173
I, I know how bad
all of this looks, I do.

363
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:58,205
But I swear
I did not murder anyone.

364
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,446
Do you guys believe me?
Do you?

365
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,181
Of course we do, Sandra.
Don't be ridiculous.

366
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,553
Counselor?
Yes?

367
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,216
Would you please retire
with me to the hallway,

368
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,227
where we can exchange words
in hushed tones?

369
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,726
Okay, what are you doing?
What?

370
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,928
You are supposed to be
demonstrating confidence
and swagger for Hornstock.

371
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,563
Instead you're poking holes
in our case, and you're
scaring our defendant.

372
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,699
Here are the facts, Shawn.
All we know about Sandra
is what she's told us.

373
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,437
I think we need
to do some investigating.

374
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,809
I believe her.
Hornstock believes her.
What else do we need?

375
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,370
We need proof, Shawn.

376
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,847
Look, right here in this book?

377
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:35,910
<i>Corey v. Bulevic</i> in 1955.
The key piece of evidence
were half-melted candlesticks.

378
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,354
We need evidence!
Where are our candlesticks,
Shawn?

379
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,755
Maybe you just
jumped over them?

380
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,850
What?
Be nimble. Be quick.

381
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,451
You're not going to give me
anything for that?

382
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,087
Now can we please...

383
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,596
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Check out the judge.

384
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,864
He's grabbing his back.
No wonder he's so grumpy.

385
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,031
He's not grabbing his back,
he's grabbing his kidneys.

386
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,041
He probably
has a kidney stone.

387
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,468
Dude, nice!
Thank you.

388
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:04,004
Please state to the court
what your relationship
with Mr. Hale was.

389
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,644
It was professional.
He was my boss.
I was his receptionist.

390
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:11,179
And as the Channel 8
receptionist, Miss Osterman,

391
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:15,625
if people were to call
Jackson Hale,
you took those calls?

392
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:16,683
I did.

393
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:21,893
And did you receive any calls
from the defendant,
Sandra Panitch, at any time?

394
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,457
Oh, not to my knowledge. No.

395
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,435
But other women would call?

396
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,596
Sure.

397
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,038
Was Jackson Hale
sleeping with these women?

398
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,269
Objection, Your Honor,
hearsay.

399
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,808
I'll allow the question.

400
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,847
Well, I can only say that
I fielded many calls,

401
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:39,111
and sometimes I helped
to juggle these calls.

402
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,583
He was a handsome man.

403
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,643
He certainly was.

404
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,850
Thank you, Miss Osterman.

405
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,156
JUDGE LELAND:
You may step down,
Miss Osterman.

406
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,218
Thanks.

407
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,966
Your Honor, the state requests
a moment to prepare
for our next witness.

408
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,264
"He certainly was"?
What happened?
You were rolling!

409
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,033
I don't know, I don't know,
it sounded good in my head.

410
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,767
You have a great
support system, you know,

411
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:03,865
it gives you
that easy confidence.

412
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,910
But, you know,
my father hasn't been
in the courtroom once.

413
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,002
Not one of my trials.

414
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,138
You've been here one day,
and your father's
already here.

415
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,772
What are you talking about?

416
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,545
Oh, I met him outside.
He's a really nice guy.

417
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,461
(CLEARING THROAT) Your Honor,
the defense would like to call
for a recess.

418
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,556
Excuse me. Who are you?

419
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,193
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
My name is Shawn Spencer.

420
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,861
I'm a psychic legal consultant
on this case.

421
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:35,703
Objection, Your Honor. We were
not made aware that a psychic
was hired on this case.

422
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,072
Approach the bench,
all of you.

423
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,399
Sweet.

424
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,177
Your Honor, the people
question his validity.

425
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,774
Okay, first of all,
that's hurtful.

426
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,513
Look, I know you're
the big bad prosecutor

427
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,215
with the sweet head,
but is this tone
really necessary?

428
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,224
No. Look,
I'm a legitimate consultant.

429
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,624
I've been hired often
by the Santa Barbara
Police Department,

430
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,562
and there is a high-ranking
detective in this very
courtroom right now,

431
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,997
who will vouch
for my validity.

432
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,728
And who is this?

433
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:07,169
He's right there. The wispy,
yet commanding Irish fellow,

434
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,639
who looks like
he's been sucking on
the Sour Patch Kids.

435
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,768
Will you stand
and state your name
for the court?

436
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,612
Carlton Lassiter,
Santa Barbara Police
Department, Your Honor.

437
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,981
Head detective,
11 years this May.

438
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,613
Perhaps you'd like to
inform the court of your
favorite color as well.

439
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,782
The point is,
do you know this man?

440
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:26,881
I do.

441
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,553
And has he worked on cases
for the department?

442
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,925
He has.

443
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,224
There you have it.
There you have it.

444
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,764
And he was helpful?

445
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,564
Absolutely.

446
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,368
Did he just say absolutely
with a little half smile?

447
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,497
I'd like that
printed out, please.

448
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,475
I'm thinking of shellacking it
on a nice piece of maple,
maybe a little decoupage.

449
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,307
Your Honor, as you can see,
I'm responsible

450
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,677
for breaking many cases here
in the state of California.

451
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:54,117
Well, guess what? I don't care
who you are, or what
you've done for the state.

452
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:58,282
I don't believe in that
psychic mumbo-jumbo and it's
not welcome in my court!

453
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,415
"Mumbo-jumbo"?

454
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:02,983
(GASPING) Oh!
You poor, poor man.

455
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,958
No wonder. You're...

456
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,091
(WHISPERING)
Passing a kidney stone
can be very stressful.

457
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,100
Who told you that?
I never told anyone.

458
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,659
You tell me if
I'm overstepping
my bounds here,

459
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,003
but I'd like to suggest an old
home remedy that did wonders
for my Aunt Dolores.

460
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,099
She simply gargled
with some mineral water,

461
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,404
followed it up
with some raw greens.

462
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,446
Me, personally,
I'd go with asparagus tips,

463
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:25,779
that way, later on,
when you're making water,

464
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,715
you'll know that it's working.

465
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,291
Let's proceed with the trial.

466
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,292
Okay, you got me?
I'm startled.
What are you doing here?

467
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,729
Well, maybe
we're both psychics.

468
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,323
I am serious.

469
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,801
Occasionally,
I come down here,
I sit in on a trial.

470
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,599
Today, I get a phone call.

471
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,537
Guess who's practicing
law now?

472
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,871
Wait a minute.
You come down
here regularly?

473
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,706
Thursdays, usually.
Today was just a bonus.

474
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,839
My God, you just
can't let go, can you?

475
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,976
You retired too early.
Not my fault. I didn't ask you
to turn in your badge, Dad.

476
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,351
Shawn! Shawn! Shawn!
I'm in there
trying to do something...

477
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:07,153
You seem to forget whose name
you've got at the end
of your letterhead, kid.

478
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,353
When you use my name,
it is my business as well.

479
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,824
Give me my phone.

480
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,161
Took you long enough
to figure out
the kidney stone.

481
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:24,834
Let it be noted that
the witness identified
the defendant, Sandra Panitch,

482
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:30,071
as the woman he saw running
through the parking lot
on the night of the murder.

483
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,640
Has it been authenticated?

484
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,312
Hey, what would Phelps need
to get authenticated?

485
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,820
(SIGHING) I don't know.

486
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,448
His little collection
of green army men?

487
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,719
H-Stock, did you just
make a joke?

488
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,226
Hmm?
I think you did.

489
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,284
(CHUCKLES)

490
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,628
Your witness.
Does the defense
wish to cross-examine?

491
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,098
Your Honor, the defense rests.

492
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,729
(COUGHING) No. No, it doesn't.

493
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:59,203
Your Honor,
the defense may rest.
Why am I not resting?

494
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,801
I have a vibe
that's very strong.

495
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,246
Hatred, jealousy.
That guy wanted to be
a serious weatherman.

496
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,944
He has no sympathy
for Jackson Hale whatsoever.

497
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,883
Wait. What?
You think he did it?

498
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,013
No, I'm pretty sure he didn't.

499
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,284
But we can plant a seed.

00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,258

00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,990
Your Honor, the defense
does not rest.

502
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:27,764
Mr. Leonard,
you are a meteorologist,
are you not?

503
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,335
Yes, I am indeed.

504
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,170
But not on the air?

505
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,675
No, not on the air.

506
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:39,809
Hmm.
Maybe because you don't have
a meteorologist name.

507
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,250
RUBEN: I don't follow.

508
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,287
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,

509
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:48,019
but Leonard isn't a term
for any kind of weather?

510
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:49,885
No, it is not.

511
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:54,261
So, if I was to look up
Leonard, in say,
a weather glossary,

512
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:55,560
there would be no definition?

513
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,158
No, there would not.

514
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,260
Excuse me,
where is this going?

515
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,067
Yes, Mr. Hornstock,
where are you going with this?

516
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,133
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
it's just that every
successful weatherman

517
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,510
that I know of,
has a real weatherman's name.

518
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,744
Johnny Mountain, Dallas Rains?

519
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,479
Oh, Jackson Hale, for example.

520
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,647
Hey, first of all that
wasn't even his real name.

521
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:18,916
Precisely.

522
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,618
Have you ever considered
going by the name
of Bolt Lightning?

523
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:22,819
No.

524
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,189
Cloudy McMillen?
No.

525
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:28,856
Wendy Morning Dew?

526
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,130
That's a woman's name.
Okay, look, I have a degree

527
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,968
in meteorology from
the University of Virginia.

528
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,565

on Bernoulli's theorem

529
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,269

530
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:43,713
and I was a junior tornado
safety captain
for seven years.

00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,216
Jackson Hale
has a degree in what?

532
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:49,046
Physical education
from a junior college.

533
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,645
He was an embarrassment.
He was worthless, all right?

534
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:55,318
He was worthless to anyone
who was a real meteorologist
like myself.

535
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:59,193
He should have been stabbed
in the heart long ago!

536
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,061

539
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,966
That's the kind of confidence
I'm talking about.

Just because we had
a small victory in court
yesterday

we're out of the woods.

I swear, I should arrest
that weatherman.

547
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,489
He clearly stated
it was not going to
rain today.

548
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:31,552
You see, that's the problem
with what I like to call
"group thinking."

We don't listen
to group thinkers.

Nope.

In fact, we don't listen
to weathermen at all.

I've really got
better things to do.

You go. I'll catch up
with you in a sec.

You know, Shawn,
for a psychic,

557
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:50,373
you are missing something
right in front of your face.
It's too bad.

558
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:53,315
You might actually learn
something about Lassiter.
Maybe you don't want to.

559
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,012
He waxes his back?

560
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,144
I'm gonna go now.

Shawn, I don't care what
anyone else says.

Who's Detective Assi?

565
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,751
Lassy. It's Lassiter.
He must have sent some sort
of memo to Phelps.

566
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,191
The question is
why would Lassiter

567
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,195
send a letter
to the D.A.'s office?

568
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,026
Don't you ever watch
<i>Law and Order?</i>

569
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,760
They tend to work
together sometimes.

570
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:45,769
Right. So... So, go ahead
and check the files,

571
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,395
and find me that letter.

572
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,837
Phelps received it
on the seventh.

573
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:49,931
I've been through all of them.

574
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,306
There are no memos submitted
into evidence,
filed on the seventh.

575
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,175
So, it didn't get filed.
But there is a memo.

576
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:59,412
So whatever's on that memo
is clearly worth hiding.

577
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,683
And she told you
this directly?

578
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,746
Yes, when I questioned
the defendant,

579
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,849
she admitted to having
sexual relations
with the victim.

580
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,918
But not to stabbing him
with a letter opener?

581
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:18,024
Well, she appeared at the time
to be confused
and had memory gaps.

582
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,628
She claimed never
to have seen or touched
the weapon.

583
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:24,402
Even though her fingerprints
were all over it. I see.

584
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,902
Thank you, Detective Lassiter.
Nothing further.

585
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:30,774
Your witness.

586
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:31,838
You sure about this?

587
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,441
Yes, I have a very strong
feeling about this letter.

588
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,579
First rule of trial law,
never ask a question
you don't know the answer to.

Hey, have I steered
you wrong yet? Come on.

590
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:47,091
Detective Lassiter,
did you send a letter

591
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,191
to the D.A.'s office
on the seventh of August?

592
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,934
Yes, I did.

593
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,494
And what did it say?

594
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,699
I... Objection,
lack of foundation.

595
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,369
I'll allow it. Go ahead,
tell the jury what it said.

596
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,539
It questioned
the defendant's motive.

597
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,810
That it was
very strong, you mean?

598
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,717
No, it questioned
whether I believed
the defendant had one at all.

So, at this point,
Your Honor, the defense

received the letter.

withhold it.

must be submitted to

of that ruling,

I would like to submit
a new piece of evidence.

Hornstock, I am on your side.

I mean, not technically,

You're making me nervous.

I can't afford it, Dad.

You don't have a record.

691
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,433
It's so weird. The prosecution
keeps treating this case

692
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,340
like a crime of passion,
right?

693
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,639
But she only knew him
for a couple of hours.

694
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:31,648
I ask you, how much passion
can you muster up for someone
in a couple of hours?

695
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:35,174
Yeah, well, crimes of passion
are rarely about love
or sex, Shawn.

696
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,518
They're closer to revenge,
sometimes hatred.

697
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:41,221
I would say that
your angry meteorologist

698
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,987
is the best suspect
you got going.

699
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,892
He didn't do it.
Yeah, I know that, Shawn.

700
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,421
The point is you need to find
somebody who felt like that.

Oh, Dad, believe me, there are
plenty. The guy slept with

down in the courtroom.

go somewhere

710

there's some rogue meter maid
who's decided to have

711

a ticketing vendetta
against me and my motorcycle.

712
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,162

might not happen
if you didn't park your bike

00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,373
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How did you know that?
Wait a second. How...

attention now?

every time you're out
on that road?

hated that bike.

hard ass about it since I...

Since you what, Shawn?
Since you what?
Since you had your accident?

Is that is? Is that where
your old man crossed the line?

Fine, I tell you what.
I will back off,
I'm gonna lay off, man.

I'll tell you what you do.

learn how to park.

Yes, if we have
new information,

758

but I have nothing
else to ask her.

Actually, Your Honor,
he can, under the rule 775A

of the California state
rules of evidence.

780

785
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,758

786

law school?

00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,866
Just sixth grade law,

788
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,870
But it was
an accelerated program.

789
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:47,927
Hmm.

790
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,640
It is up to
my discretion
to allow any testimony

791
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,836
that may speak
to the truth of this case.

792
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,879
Proceed, Mr. Spencer,
with caution.

793
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,881
Thank you, Your Honor.

794
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,142
All right.

Just warming her up
for you, bro.
Yeah, go.

796
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,518
Hi, Priscilla.
Hi.

797
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,217
Everybody here
is absolutely certain

798
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,158
you didn't sleep
with Jackson Hale.

799
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:16,496
But Jackson Hale slept
with everybody.

800
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,027
Except for you.
Isn't that right?

801
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,131
You couldn't take it,
could you?

802
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,606
Him walking by
every single day

803
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,439
without ever noticing you.
Not once!

Repeatedly choosing
to sleep with women

805
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,345
like the defendant,
Sandra Panitch!

806
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,906
Oh, that's...
That's not true.

807
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:37,781
That video will show
Jackson Hale being murdered.

808
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,252
But not by Sandra Panitch.

809
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,150
By you.

810
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:45,627
Objection, Your Honor.
I mean, this is...
It's ridiculous.

811
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:50,133
I feel the tape is the proof!
The tape is the pudding!

812
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,725
Your Honor, I said objection!

813
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,292
I demand you get him
to stop that!

814
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:57,967
Sit down. Do you need
a tutorial in rule 775?

815
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:02,407
Mr. Riggs, can you please
play the tape again?

816
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:07,246
Thank you. Just take it
back a little bit.

817
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:11,612
Forward, I'm sorry, forward.
And back. Forward.
Right there!

818
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,694
Right there.

819
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,323
Right here.

00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:31,767
That. That right there.
It's a cloud.
Not a cloud, a shadow.

821
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,173
A shadow of a human person.

822
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,816
You were wearing
those glasses that night,

823
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:46,050
making it unmistakable
that you were there.

824
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:50,317
That is your shadow,
Priscilla.

825
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,429
<i>You watched.</i>
<i>You waited,</i>

826
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,659
<i>waited for them</i>
<i>to drop out of frame.</i>

827
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,293
Then bam on the head
to Sandra. And...

828
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,335
Into the heart
with Jackson!

829
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,573
You didn't think there was
any way you could be blamed

830
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:10,102
because clouds
don't kill people.

831
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,944
People kill people.

832
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:13,605
(EXCLAIMS)

833
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,186
And this was
a crime of passion.

834
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,517
But not because he loved you.

835
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,583
But because he didn't.

836
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:27,158
He walked by me
in the hallway every day,
like I didn't exist,

837
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,665
like I was invisible.

838
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:34,433
And so you proved him right,
by being invisible
on that tape.

839
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,539
We would have been
the most amazing couple,

840
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,871
he just refused to see it.

841
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:43,772
He just broke my heart over
and over and over again.

842
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,008
So, I just broke his!

843
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,515
By stabbing it
with a letter opener!

844
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,178
Yes! Yes, I killed him!

845
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,311
No!

846
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,753
(CROWD MURMURING)

847
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:52,880
Oh.

848
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,425
Holy crap! Did you
just hear that?

849
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,188
We heard that, yes.

850
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,587
Sorry, Your Honor.
It's just that usually

851
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,220
when I do this,
when things come to me
psychically,

852
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:01,855
I gotta jump through
all these hoops, you know?

853
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,092
I gotta find
Interim Chief Vic,

854
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,498
I gotta run stuff
by Lassy, there.

855
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,900
Sign a bunch of papers,
t's, i's, the whole bit.

856
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,268
It seems like we got
everything we need here.

857
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,137
You, the jury,
the stenographer,
Mr. Riggs!

858
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,938
I move to remove
the defendant immediately.

859
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:17,071
And take the witness
into custody for processing.

860
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,379
Bailiff! Case dismissed.

861
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,317
You mean to tell me, our whole
lives, you've never been
to a single auction?

862
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,255
Nope.
Dude, watch this,
it's very fun.

863
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:29,917
How's it fun?
You're bidding against
the public

864
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,052
for your own motorcycle.

865
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,459
What if somebody outbids you?

866
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,498
I've been practicing
my paddle raise,
it's very subtle.

867
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,589
Where is this thing?

868
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,032
Plus now that Carter Jarecki's
wife has hired us

869
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,899
to consult on her divorce,
we're flush.

870
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,232
I can go as high
as I need to go.

871
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,397
Okay.

872
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:44,999
Dad?

873
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,303
Shawn!

874
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,368
What are you doing here?
I came for your auction.

875
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:51,347
What? Was there a boating
incident I didn't hear about?

876
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:52,677
A little tuna boat
get impounded?

877
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,808
You know,
actually, Shawn, no.

878
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,044
I felt bad
about those tickets,

879
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,916
so I'm here to get
your bike for you.

880
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,113
Get out of here.

881
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,316
Hey, Shawn! Gus! What's up?

882
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,256
Hey, legal eagle!

883
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,419
I thought I might
see you here.

884
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,293
Oh, you know?
The name partners
were very impressed,

885
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,389
and they're anxious
to hire you guys again.

886
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,992
Especially this new guy.
What's his name?

887
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,366
Oh, it's me!

888
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:14,426
Hey!

889
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,734
Congratulations.
You got the bump!

890
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,796
Thank you.

891
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:18,864
We'd love to work
with you again.

892
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,638
So, what is it now,
"Hornstock, Hornstock,

893
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,008
"Hornstock, Biederman
and Hornstock"?

894
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,411
We had to get
wider doors, but yes.

895
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,949
Hey, I didn't get
to thank you properly.

896
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,711
So, you know,
I'm here for the auction.

897
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,719
I'm gonna put some money
down on that bike.
Get it back for you.

898
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:30,845
(CHUCKLES)

899
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,946
Guys, really. I do.
I appreciate it,
it's very sweet,

900
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,820
but I can stand
on my own two feet

901
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,325
and get my own bike back.

902
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:37,519
Shawn!

903
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:38,785
Buzz.

904
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,457
I believe this is yours.
They just pulled it
from the auction.

905
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:42,829
Pulled it from
the auction. What?

906
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,495
I was... I was... I've been
practicing my paddle raise.
It's a subtle move.

907
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,630
Yeah, you got your bike back.
It was taken care of
internally.

908
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,698
What does that mean?
"Internally"?

909
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,335
I don't know.
They just gave me
the paperwork.

910
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:03,348
What are you looking at?
Go home!
