Okay.

172
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,821
Stop.

173
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,163
Please. Let's just,
let's just stop.

174
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,533
Come here, sit down.
Please, sit.

175
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,541
All right,
this is me talking.
This is Shawn.

176
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,205
What's going on?
I usually to have to drag you
to these cases,

177
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,680
kicking and screaming,
and those are
real police cases.

178
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,843
Now, all of a sudden
we have some client
who's either bonkers

179
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,887
or, judging by the size
of the bags under his eyes,

180
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,514
suffering from nothing
more than waking dreams
or hallucinations

181
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,024
and you, you're ready
to go ghost-hunting.

182
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,059
Talk to me.

183
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,561
All right.

184
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,932
All right.

185
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,934
I never told this
to anyone before,
but I was 12.

186
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,868
Gus, it's me.

187
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,912
It was late.

188
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,739
I was in my room
with the lights off.

189
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,283
I heard a voice.

190
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,546
Gus, I'm sure
there's a perfectly
logical explanation.

191
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,420
No, no, no, Shawn.
It wasn't on TV
and it wasn't a radio.

192
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,322
It was coming from the walls.

193
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,883
And the voice,

194
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,661
the voice told me

195
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,857
that our house was built on
an old Indian burial ground.

196
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:28,923
Shut up.

197
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,298
And she said...

198
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,232
She said she was sad
because she had died
many moons ago

199
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,240
and was trapped
between worlds.

200
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,269
When I asked her
her name, Shawn,

201
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,375
she said,

202
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,883
"My name..."
(MIMICKING WOMAN'S VOICE)
"My name is Wilting Flower.

203
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,311
"I died without knowing love.

204
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,780
"Will you be my friend?"

205
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,553
How did you know that?

206
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,355
I never told that
to anyone before.

207
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,396
I was Wilting Flower.

208
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:01,729
Gus! I can't believe
that you fell for that.

209
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:06,500
I put an old walkie-talkie
in the wall when your dad
put in the new insulation.

210
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,871
The old Indian burial ground,
you bought that?

211
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,241
I got that from <i>Poltergeist</i>
or <i>Poltergeist II.</i>

212
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,479
<i>Gremlins?</i>
No, it wasn't <i>Gremlins.</i>

213
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,745
That's not funny, Shawn.

214
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,378
You know what? Let's add
a "Trixie" to that.

215
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,184
She is the companion
to "Scrappy", right?

216
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,756
Okay, great. Let's add that
to Girl With Flowers

217
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,624
and Merry Musicians.

218
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:34,359
Okay, now listen,
I need the card to read,
"Happy birthday.

219
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:38,396
"'Ex' is the Ioneliest letter
in the alphabet."

220
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,929
But I need you to spell it,
E-X, as in...

221
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,272
Oh, you got it.

222
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,208
Okay, well, see,
it continues,

223
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:52,080
"From your not yet 'ex',
E-X, husband,

224
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,675
"Carlton."

225
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,646
Perfect. These will
go out today, right?

226
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,623
All righty-dighty.
Thank you very much.

227
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,924
I didn't know
you collected figurines.

228
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,656
You know, I have
a grandmother...
Do you not knock?

229
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,254
There's no door.

230
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,590
And?

231
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,101
Sorry. The DA's office called.

232
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,330
They said that we can
have access to Dr. Blinn's
patients' files.

233
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,667
About time.

234
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,370
Let's go get in there,
get those addresses.

235
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,409
Bring these nut jobs
in for questioning.

236
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:24,947
Here's where I found
all my paintings last weekend
upside down.

237
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,542
(DEVICE BEEPING)
I've got a cold spot.
Right here.

238
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,245
Feel it?
Yes.

239
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,550
Yes, I do. Robert,
we've definitely got
something here.

240
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,856
You're standing
under a vent.

241
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,466
So, all these are yours, huh?

242
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,566
Yeah. I'm trying to
get ready for a show.

243
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:54,306
No kidding.
Has anything strange
ever happened here?

244
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,872
Sometimes I get the feeling
that the furniture
has been moved.

245
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,440
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

246
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,951
Did you actually
see it happen?

247
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,252
No, no, I just come
into a room and everything's
not where I left it.

248
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,195
Robert, do you have
a photo album?

249
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,358
Yeah.

250
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,870
Ah.

251
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,301
Hmm.

252
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,900
That's a nice shot, huh?

253
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:30,039
(EXCLAIMING)
I feel it! I feel it.

254
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,773
Oh, Gus, Gus, oh!

255
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,683
Oh! She is angry!

256
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,915
She is angry! She is soaring!

257
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,354
With rage and...

258
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,584
(HOLLERING)

259
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,250
She wants to go
to the bedroom!

260
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,385
Where's the bedroom?

261
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,328
It's here! Here!
Take me! Oh!

262
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,730
(SQUAWKING)

263
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,301
I've lost her.

264
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,176
You don't believe me,
do you?

265
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,549
No, no, of course we do.
You saw it, too, didn't you?

266
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,848
Guys,

267
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,755
please, stay the night.

268
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,189
Then you'll see.

269
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,250
I mean, you don't know
what it's been like.

270
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,852
I can't work.
I can't concentrate.

271
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,160
I wake up in the morning
more tired than
when I went to bed.

272
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,759
Days pass
when I can't remember
what I've done...

273
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,497
(ROBERT SOBBING)

274
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,706
This pulls out into a bed,
but that's all I got.

275
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:07,439
Oh, no worries.
What's a little spooning
between old pals, huh, Gus?

276
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,741
Well, good night.

277
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,509
Good night, Robert.

278
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,777
You got the floor.

279
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,216
Oh, we'll make it work.

280
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,482
You don't mind
if I nude up
for the sleepover, right?

281
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:20,321
Seriously, Shawn, only one
of us is sleeping at a time.
The other one is on watch.

282
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,223
Oh, no, we'll both sleep.

283
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,558
I'll put on some socks,
make you feel
more comfortable.

284
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,724
Stop playing, Shawn.
We're here to solve a case.

285
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,533
I already solved it.

286
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,833
When? When you were flapping
a book like a bird?

287
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:36,363
Gus, if you must know,
it was a bald eagle.

288
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:37,839
And, yes.

289
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,373
You found the ghost?

290
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,778
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

291
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,008
Yes, there is, Shawn.

292
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,075
No, there isn't,
but there is such thing
as a pissed off ex-girlfriend.

293
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,676
What ex-girlfriend?

294
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,585
No one mentioned
anything about an ex.

295
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,681
You didn't look
at the photo album?

296
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,252
Redhead. She's cute.

297
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,818
What makes you think
she's an ex?

298
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,990
Oh, come on, there's dirty
dishes everywhere.

299
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:04,058
His bedroom is a mess,
his nails are filthy,
his hair is horrible.

300
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,135
No girlfriend is gonna
put up with that.

301
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,695
And, exhibit A,

302
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,373
who else would "X"
through his face
in all these pictures?

303
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,901
Okay. Okay, say
she's the ex,

304
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,272
we still don't know
if she's actually been here.

305
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,284
There are strands of red hair
all over the studio.

306
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,515
Should we tell Robert?

307
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,151
How psychic would that be?

308
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,752
No, we'll spend the night.
It's fine.

309
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,160
Catch up with
the ex tomorrow.

310
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,755
Talk to her,
see what's going on.

311
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,266
Meanwhile, I'm going to do
some sit-ups.

312
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,996
Come hold my feet.

313
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,431
I'm going to do a thousand.

314
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,923
Shawn! Get up! Fire!

315
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,789
(EXCLAIMING)

316
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,428
Get Robert!

317
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,631
I could have died.

318
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,505
If you guys weren't here, I...

319
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:20,235
Why is it doing this to me?
Why is it trying to kill me?

320
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,338
Okay. Okay, Robert,
hey, hey, hey.

321
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,113
Hey, Bobby, look at me.

322
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:31,154
Now, who here has
communicated with more
dispossessed souls,

323
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,554
you or me?

324
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,320
You?
That's correct.

325
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:38,796
Now, I am telling you
that this, this fire was not
an attempt on your life.

326
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,195
It wasn't?
No.

327
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,396
This was a sad
and desperate cry for help

328
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,302
from a very frightened,
very Ionely apparition.

329
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,704
Are you sure about this?
Absolutely.

330
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,270
Of course it's also possible
that someone simply
left a candle burning.

331
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,143
I don't burn candles.

332
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,841
Gus, did you burn
a candle?

333
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,179
Why would I do that?
Cry for help it is.

334
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,481
No one came in
while we were sleeping.

335
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,850
I checked the doors
and windows.

336
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,320
They were all locked

337
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,249
from the inside.

338
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,122
Why are you looking
at me like that?

339
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,859
That's all you did?
Checked the doors
and the windows?

340

Yeah, why?

Where did that come from?

00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,511
Don't look at me.
I'm not wearing lipstick.

343
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,855
This is the only
post office box listed
for Regina Kane.

344
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,085
According to
Dr. Blinn's calendar,
she was his last appointment.

345
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,458
She might have
seen something.
I want to find her.

346
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,054
Well, if this is where
she picks up her mail,
she probably lives close by.

347
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,031
Canvas the neighborhood,
see if anyone knows her.

348
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,795
That's a really
smart approach.

349
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,031
What? That,
that shocks you?

350
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,628

as a compliment.

Really?
Yeah.

00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,566
Thanks a lot.

353
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,270

354
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,871
No.
Oh.

00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,645

Mr. Spencer,

367
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,139

when you interfere
with a police investigation?

368
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,342
The case gets solved?

369
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,677
Wait a minute,
you guys are working on
that murder thingy, right?

370
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,620
I completely forgot
about that. How's that going?

371
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:52,225
Silly question.
We'll let you guys get back
to your investigating.

we get some lunch, then I
have to get back to work.

375
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,298
Gus, the plot is thickening.

376
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,567
Shawn, I've already missed
two days this week.

377

No, but close.

388

Robert's ex-girlfriend lives
up here, Gus, and we really
need to talk to her.

389
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,198
I will kill you, Shawn.

buy me some new tires.

list you as a reference.

SHAWN: Hallelujah.

510
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,041
Wow.

511
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,777
SHAWN: What?

512
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,618
You got to see this.

513
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,857
(GRUNTS)

514
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,757
Huh.

515
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,092
Not what I was expecting.

516
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,965
Okay, I know
what I'm looking at,
but what does it mean?

517
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,835
Is it a ghost?

518
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,608
No, buddy, it's not a ghost.

519
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,579
Is there a woman
living up here?

520
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:04,884
Well, that would certainly
explain the perfume
Robert's been smelling

521
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,857
and all the red hair
laying everywhere,
but no, no dice.

522
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,052
Then, what is it?

523
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,186
Oh, come on, Gus. Look.

524
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:18,964
What?
Robert is a woman.

525
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,436
No, he's not.

526
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,999
Not all the time,
but sometimes.

527
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,042
No. Doesn't seem
like the type.

528
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,509
He's not the type.
Then how?

529
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:30,139
Unless he has that
personality thing.

530
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,341
What personality thing?

531
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,849
Oh, you know
what I'm talking about.

532
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,317
The multiple
personality disease.

533
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,378
You know, that
what's her name had,

534
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,685
<i>The Flying Nun</i>
in the other thing,
the TV movie.

535
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,487
<i>Smokey and the Bandit?</i>

536
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,656
Yeah, dude,
<i>Smokey and the Bandit.</i>
Yes.

537
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,356
What does that have to do
with multiple personalities?

538
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,955
You asked.
I asked a real question.

539
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,024
You were supposed
to give me a real answer,
not a random guess.

540
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,898
Okay. Fine. <i>Hooper.</i>

541
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,897
<i>Hooper?</i>
<i>Hooper.</i>

542
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,065
<i>Hooper</i> was a stuntman.
Oh.

543
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,541
I don't think Sally Field
is even in <i>Hooper.</i>
Who are you thinking of?

544
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,872
Oh...

545
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,070
Terry Bradshaw.

546
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,545
Yes.

547
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,214
Is it <i>Norma Rae?</i>

548
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:06,716
No, but that would
have made that movie
a lot cooler.

549
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,650
The thing you asked
about Shawn,

550
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,416
is referred to as
dissociative identity
disorder.

551
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,980
That's it!
That's what Robert has, Gus.
It all makes sense.

552
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,151
Do you know
how rare that is?

553
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:18,195
I'm not saying all
of Santa Barbara has it,
just Robert. One guy.

554
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,753
I think that qualifies
as pretty rare.

555
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:20,991
I don't know, Shawn.

556
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,058
These are huge.
Look. Think about it.

557
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,467
There's two separate,
but distinct personalities,

558
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,971
one body.

559
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,473
One's a man,
the other's a woman.

560
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,710
The female personality
cooks dinner.

561
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,405
Robert thinks the meals
are the work of a ghost.

562
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,744
The female rearranges
the furniture.

563
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:41,252
Robert thinks
the ghost is moving things
when he's not around.

564
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,288
His old girlfriend did say
that he would disappear
for stretches at a time,

565
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,654
which would explain
when the female personality
was in control,

566
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,250
Robert would disappear.

567
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,224
And he would have
no clue to any of it.

568
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:56,859
Now, all we need to figure out
is how to bring out the woman
so that we can talk to her.

569
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,961
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

570
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,034
Triggers.

571
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,576
We shoot him? Then what?

572
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,111
No, no, sights,
sounds, smells.

573
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,744
Something that would trigger
the personality to come out.

574
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,282
Triggers it is.

575
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,944
Gus, this is going to be
kind of cool.

576
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,482
Or weird.

577
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,818
Where did all this stuff
come from?

578
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,828
Is this
where she lives?

579
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,499
The angry female spirit
that you sensed?

580
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,365
Oh, yes.

581
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,432
I feel her very
strongly here, Robert.

582
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,770
Do you?

583
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,812
Do you feel

584
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,008
pretty?

585
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,682
What?

586
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,720
Do you feel pretty?

587
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,118
He means
do you feel a...

588
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,182
female presence?

589
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,295
No, but I'm not a psychic.

590
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,367
Do you think that you can

591
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:07,026
(COUGHS)

592
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,066
Communicate with her?

593
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,074
I'm trying. I am.

594
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,470
Sorry.

595
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,482
Okay. You guys are
starting to creep me out.

596
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,917
So, if I'm not needed,
I think I'll go
back downstairs.

597
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,717
Okay. Let me just
put this away. We'll all
go down together.

598
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,260
You coming, Shawn?
Yes.

599
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,327
Oh, wow, Robert,

600
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,963
these are some
terrific clothes.

601
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,339
I bet they look absolutely
beautiful on you,

602
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,071
Regina.

603
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,248
Regina? Who...
Who are you talking to?

604
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,012
Yes. Yes, Gus,

605
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,054
why don't you tell Regina

606
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,351
how much you like

607
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,722
her nice clothes.

608
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,261
Wow.

609
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,991
Yeah, Regina.

610
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,895
Regina.

611
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,566
You look beautiful.

612
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,170
Regina?

613
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,472
Regina?

614
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,612
Thank you, Gus.

615
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,050
I can't tell you
how glad I am

616
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,388
that you got my message.

617
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,725
So,

618
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,791
do you think that
you can help me?

619
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,129
Please.

620
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,303
Dude.

621
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,068
This isn't right.

622
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,482
I must look horrible.

623
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:01,950
No. Not at all.

624
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,987
ROBERT: You are too kind.

625
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:07,422
But then again,
I already knew that
the way you comforted Robert.

626
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,620
You are so sweet.

627
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,466
Unlike most men,
afraid to show their emotions.

628
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,525
I've been hurt a lot.

629
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:23,438
Now if you two don't mind,
I really must put on my face.

630
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,835
Wow.

631
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,779
So, Regina, this message
on the wall,

632
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,645
this was your way
of trying to get
Robert's attention?

633
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,515
Well, he doesn't even know
I'm alive.

634
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:39,784
Why not write him a letter?
Or an e-mail?
Even a post-it even?

635
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,690
I tried. I really did try.

636
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,021
But every time, something
or someone stopped you.

637
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,827
What are you talking about?
I think there's
another personality.

638
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,095
Regina, there's another
personality, isn't there?

639
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,330
I mean, you don't smash
pictures or start fires.

640
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:54,928
You would never
strangle Robert.

641
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,871
No, I wouldn't.

642
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,569
Regina, the police would
like to speak with you.

643
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,611
They're investigating
Dr. Blinn's murder.

644
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,239
They think you might
have seen something.
You could be in danger.

645
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,078
I didn't see anything.

646
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,050
I didn't even go
to my appointment.

647
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,485
Why would anyone
want to hurt Dr. Blinn?

648
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:15,288
He was such a nice man
and he was doing
so much to help me.

649
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,726
With what?

650
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,456
Well, you ought to know
better than to ask that.

651
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:25,127
That's between a woman
and her doctor.

652
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:26,901
Okay.

653
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,802
Unless you're going to
ask her out,
I think we're done here.

654
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,102
How do we get Robert back?

655
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,502
I have no idea.

656
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,704
Well, you're her
very special friend.

657
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,112
Regina?

658
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,919
We would like to
speak with Robert.

659
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:49,017
Can you let Robert
come out and play?

660
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,030
For you,

661
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,372
of course I can.

662
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:03,633
Thank you.

663
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,835
And I do hope
that we meet again.

664
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,006
Robert.

665
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,908
Robert?

666
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,114
Robert.

667
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,187
Try Bob.

668
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,361
(SCREAMS)

669
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,592
SHAWN: Easy, easy,
easy, easy.

670
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:31,863
We know it seems weird
and... Actually, it is.

671
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,301
Yeah.
It's really weird.

672
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,963
But we have good news.

673
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,072
We figured out
who your ghost is.

674
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,439
Who?

675
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,473
BOTH: You.

676
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,472
You're haunting
yourself.

677
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:52,083
SHAWN: Yep. Life is good.
Life is great.

678
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,556
I mean, Robert gets the help
he so desperately needs,

679
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,425
we get to marinate
in the delicious satisfaction
of another job well done.

680
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,988
And leading Lassiter
to Regina, even though
she saw nothing.

681
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,260
That's professional courtesy.

682
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,302
Plus it helps
raise our stock, Gus.

683
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,360
(EXCLAIMS)
Crime scene photos.

684
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,463
Love crime scene photos.

685
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,301
May I help you?

686
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,478
Detective O'Hara,

687
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:18,174
what a truly
pleasant surprise.
Mmm-hmm.

688
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:21,480
I just dropped by
to tell Detective Lassiter
that I have...

689
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:27,424
We have information
regarding the whereabouts
of a one, Regina Kane.

690
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,351
How did you know about it?

691
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,657
Never mind. Stay right here.
Don't move. I'll go find him.

692
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,958
Ooh.

693
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:38,728
Shawn.

694
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,196
Shawn, don't do this.

695
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,205
(HUMMING <i>BLUE DANUBE)</i>

696
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,130
Look at this. Look at this.
Look! Look! Look!

697
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,532
Here, on the floor
where poor Dr. Blinn's body
was laying.

698
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,001
A toothpick.

699
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,803
A chewed toothpick.

700
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,202
GUS: Yeah? So?
Don't you remember?

701
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,247
The car that tried
to ram us, on the seat?

702
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,605
Chewed toothpick. Oh!

703
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,108
Oh! That means the person
that killed Dr. Blinn

704
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,017
is the same person
that tried to kill us.

705
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,281
It's a chewed
toothpick, Shawn.

706
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,447
Lots of people
chew toothpicks.

707
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:37,756
Yes, but we were working for
Robert. Robert is also Regina.
Regina is a patient of...

708
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,023
Dr. Blinn.
Yes! Take the baton!

709
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,231
So, whoever the killer is
knew both Robert and Regina.

710
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:48,428
<i>He said his name was,</i>
<i>get this, Martin Brody.</i>
<i>How dumb is that?</i>

711
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,266
Oh! Martin Brody.

712
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:57,111
Of course!
That's Robert's other
personality. The violent one.

713
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:58,614
But, why would he kill
Dr. Blinn?

714
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:01,379
Depends entirely on what
Regina was seeing him for.

715
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,379
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

716
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:05,581
What?

717
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,988
Dr. Blinn's patient files.

718
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,625
All we have to do
is find Regina's.

719
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,333
What are you doing?

720
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,975
Hmm?
What are you doing?

721
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,012
Shooting. It relaxes me.

722
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,483
Shawn Spencer says he has
information for you.

723
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,520
Where is he?
At your desk.

724
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,386
Is anyone watching him?

725
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,249
Found it!

726
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,124
Oh, no.

727
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,457
What?

728
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,460
Gender reassignment?

729
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,699
Oh, Regina started feeling
like a woman trapped
in a man's body,

730
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,703
so she wants
to have her parts...

731
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,002
Oh, my...
Wait a second.

732
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,935
That means
if Regina was successful,

733
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:03,037
both Robert and the Martin
personality would also
lose their parts.

734
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,173
(EXCLAIMING) Martin can't do
anything to hurt Regina

735
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,716
because he would
only be hurting himself.

736
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,582
<i>So, dressed as Regina,</i>
<i>he goes after Dr. Blinn.</i>

737
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,781
<i>GUS: That would explain</i>
<i>how Robert got the marks</i>
<i>on his neck.</i>

738
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,118
<i>And with Dr. Blinn dead,</i>

739
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,091
<i>Robert figured that</i>
<i>Regina would change her mind</i>
<i>about the gender reassignment.</i>

740
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,286
Right.

741
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,693
We got that, Shawn!

742
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,356
Only she hasn't.

743
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:28,198
Gus, no, no, she found
another doctor.
She's seeing him today.

744
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:29,466
When?

745
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,672
Right now.

746
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,733
Right now, Shawn?
Like, in 10 minutes.

747
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,176
Oh, okay.

748
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,881
There had better be
a really good explanation
for this.

749
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,256
He was in some sort of trance.
I couldn't control him.

750
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,361
He says this is the killer.

751
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:57,731
The killer,
he's going to kill again.

752
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,094
This is ridiculous.

753
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,604
Who? Who's he going to kill?

754
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,969
What is it, Shawn?

755
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,872
(EXCLAIMING)

756
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,876
Watch out! Watch out!

757
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,969
(EXCLAIMING)

758
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,478
Oh!

759
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,216
Dr. Drake?

760
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,357
Gender reassignment?
That's a big step, Regina.

761
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,521
Why don't you tell me
why it's important to you?

762
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:27,996
(PHONE RINGING)

763
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:31,330
It's okay.
The machine can get that.
This is your time.

764
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,001
Thank you, Dr. Drake.

765
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,604
No answer. Just the machine.

766
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,206
We have to go now.
It could already be too late.

767
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,709
Let's go!

768
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,944
I know this can be
a difficult process,

769
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:50,418
but it really is necessary
to ensure that you're ready

770
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:53,184
psychologically
for a change like this.

771
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,987
You do seem like
an excellent candidate
for the surgery.

772
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,184
Our time is up.

773
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:01,356
Why don't we pick up here
again next week? Okay, Regina?

774
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,331
Okey-dokey.

775
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,630
Only

776
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:15,138
my name is not Regina.

777
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,103
Hold it!

778
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:19,911
Get up!

779
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,418
What's going on?
SHAWN: Robert?

780
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,648
Bob? You back there, buddy?

781
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,520
What am I doing here?

782
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,725
Great. Thanks.

783
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,966
Good news.

784
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:45,805
They're going to admit Robert
into the HT Windsor Facility
in Chicago.

785
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:48,310
And his doctor thinks
his prognosis is good.

786
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,138
Don't you understand, Shawn?

787
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,775
That's the premier
mental health hospital
in the country.

788
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,411
That's good. That's awesome.
Who is that?

789
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,548
Leslie.

790
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,919
Oh. Oh. No, no, no, no.

791
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,890
Leslie's supposed to be
a swimsuit model.

792
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:06,055
Unfortunately, he is.
Although, he says he's getting
completely sick of the grind.

793
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,154
I have to call the agency.

794
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,789
They're completely
misrepresenting
their clientele.

795
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,197
Leslie's a guy's name, too.

796
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,666
Okay.

797
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,228
We have to fire him.

798
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,034
Fire him? On what grounds?

799
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,040
What grounds?
On the grounds
that he's a dude.

800
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,406
That's discrimination.
We can't do that.

801
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,775
Okay, listen to me.

802
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,313
No woman is going to
look at us twice

803
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,575
if we're sharing our office
with that ridiculous Adonis.

804
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,344
He's better looking
than both of us put together.

805
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,578
Yeah.

806
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,114
I'm not doing that.

807
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,247
But, Gus,

808
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,688
you know I can't fire people.
They look too sad.

809
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,160
This was your idea.
Figure it out.

810
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,677
