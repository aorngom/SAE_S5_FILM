1
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,002
You're not coming in?

2
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:13,582
You're going to make me stand in
that deposit line all by myself?

3
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:17,642
No, buddy, I will be with you in
spirit, like a tiny wood nymph.

4
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,025
Besides, what's your glitch
with the atm machine, anyway?

5
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:21,629
It's a "people thing",
shawn.

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,722
Business should always
be done face-to-face.

7
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,484
Well, if you rember,
i'm holding a bit of a grudge...

8
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:27,277
against this particular
banking institution.

9
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,292
Why? Because they turned you down
for a small business loan last year?

10
00:00:30,293 --> 00:00:33,107
Yes, because they turned me
down for a small business loan.

11
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:34,927
That was completely legitimate, gus.

12
00:00:34,928 --> 00:00:37,069
Shawn, it was for a
zip line pulley system.

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,404
To transport snacks from
the kitchen to your desk.

14
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:42,584
Or the reception area.
What's your point?

15
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,248
Part of running a
business together, shawn...

16
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:47,553
is sharing in the responsibilities of
the "business" side of the business...

17
00:00:47,554 --> 00:00:48,988
like making deposits.

18
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,314
What about the "bidnizz" side?

19
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:52,819
'cause I feel like i'm
more of a "bidnizz" man.

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,167
- Who's covering that?
- You know what? Fine.

21
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:57,457
I'll do it myself.

22
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:44,795
Ah! He's got a gun!

23
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:50,311
Don't anybody move!

24
00:01:50,312 --> 00:01:51,550
You! Move!

25
00:01:51,804 --> 00:01:52,719
Now, don't anybody move.

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,523
Drop the gun!

27
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:55,526
You drop your gun.

28
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,778
Get over there!

29
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:03,049
Get back!

30
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:05,081
Don't anybody do anything.

31
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,812
Lassie, jules... what
are you doing here?

32
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:23,668
What areyoudoing here?

33
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,015
Shawn, we have a situation.

34
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:27,967
Some guy held up the bank...
and we think he's taken hostages.

35
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:30,353
Take it easy.

36
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:34,641
Gus is in there.

37
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:38,486
[the friendly indians' I know you know]

38
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:41,722
I know you know that I'm
not telling the truth.

39
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:45,328
I know you know they just
don't have any proof...

40
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:48,496
embrace the deception
learn how to bend...

41
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:52,702
your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end.

42
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:58,981
This is sue ellen jasper...

43
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:02,299
reporting to you live outside the
santa barbara national savings bank...

44
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:06,635
where an as-yet-unnamed assailant has
attempted to steal over a million dollars'

45
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:10,185
worth of diamonds and is
now holding hostages inside.

46
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,898
Police are on the scene. But have
yet to reveal any further details.

47
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:15,822
We'll report back to you... as
soon as we have more information.

48
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,445
You didn't see anything?

49
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:19,041
I wasn't in the bank, jules.

50
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,452
Hold it right there.

51
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,574
Why didn'tyou go into the bank?

52
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:28,166
We came here to make a deposit.
That's not really a two man job.

53
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:31,050
What, we both should've grabbed a corner of
the check and gingerly walked it in together?

54
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,065
I just find it oddly un-psychic of you to
have not known this was going to happen.

55
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:38,251
I don't see into the future,
jules. I read things in the present.

56
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,213
And I get it. You think I'm
not kicking myself enough?

57
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,062
I let my best friend go
in there without me...

58
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:44,597
and now he's stuck in there...
and I'm stuck out here.

59
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,721
Detective lassiter.

60
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:52,820
That guy could be a loose cannon.
Someone needs to go inside the bank.

61
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:56,683
O'hara, I need you to take statements from the
remaining witnesses that were outside the bank.

62
00:03:56,723 --> 00:03:57,699
Got it, chief.

63
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:58,956
- Now, detective...
- Yes.

64
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:01,736
just wanted you to know that
I've informed the fbi and swat...

65
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,777
and their chief
negotiator is moments away.

66
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:05,989
- no.
- It's protocol and you know it.

67
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:08,233
Chief, this thing's already
turning into a three ring circus...

68
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:10,092
without bringing those
adrenaline monkeys down here.

69
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:12,340
Look, we have a hostage
situation, detective.

70
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,907
And I expect you to fully cooperate.

71
00:04:14,022 --> 00:04:15,869
Just make a call in the
banks. See where we're at.

72
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,224
Maybe I can wrap this
thing up here and now.

73
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:18,480
Save the city a whole
lot of time and money.

74
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,024
Somebody needs to call into the bank.

75
00:05:03,797 --> 00:05:05,384
heads up! We're on the clock.

76
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:06,810
And...cut.

77
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,653
Great.

78
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:10,029
Dripping with swagger.
Let's go again... though.

79
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:12,612
And maybe ease up on the
cocksure smile just a bit.

80
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:15,309
I liked it. I'm just not sure
it's going to play in the midwest.

81
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:16,761
Who the hell are you?

82
00:05:16,904 --> 00:05:18,678
Oh, my apologies. I'm shawn spencer...

83
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,456
lead psychic for the s.b.p.d.

84
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:23,203
And dilettante of shadow
puppetry. What's this?

85
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:25,778
What's this right here?

86
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,030
Oh, that's a swan kissing the moon.

87
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,305
Well, I'm commander
luntz... hostage negotiator.

88
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:33,956
And I will thank you to step aside
and let me handle things from here.

89
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:36,288
Luntz.

90
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,752
Lassiter.

91
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:40,590
Perhaps as head detective... I can
brief you on what's going on here.

92
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,719
Listen, detective...

93
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,754
I don't want to play the
"title" game with you.

94
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:46,091
Title games. Is that
anything like celebrity?

95
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:48,717
Cause if it is... i'm
going to kick your ass.

96
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:50,799
What?

97
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:53,144
I will. I'm really good at the game.

98
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:54,566
Little refresher.

99
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:59,487
I have 26 years of experience and I'm sort of
an expert in human psychology and conditioning.

100
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:00,645
So I do know two things.

101
00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:01,520
one.

102
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,033
Your friend here is acting
out of a place of fear.

103
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:07,315
A little sweat on the temple...
a little vibrato in the voice.

104
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:09,461
This is personal for you.

105
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,386
And number two...

106
00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:16,154
I have about 40 seconds to initiate a call into that
bank before all the wheels spin off of this thing.

107
00:06:16,194 --> 00:06:17,984
So excuse me.

108
00:06:18,071 --> 00:06:21,596
Boys, fire me up a call inside
the bank and patch me in.

109
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:23,282
Yes, sir. Right away.

110
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:27,700
We're not just going to let
him do this. Right, lassie?

111
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,291
It's protocol.

112
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:32,353
We have no choice.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,525
Whose phone is that?

114
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:51,947
It's his phone.

115
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:53,063
Thank you, sir.

116
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:54,671
We're hostages together.

117
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:58,116
We're supposed to be
on the same side here.

118
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:01,076
Give me the phone.

119
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:02,925
I apologize.

120
00:07:03,137 --> 00:07:05,518
I would... but it's my work phone.

121
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:08,525
And I get charged the deductible
for any lost or stolen items.

122
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:11,343
So how about I just turn the ringer off?

123
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,761
Everyone... cell phones.

124
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:17,342
now.

125
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:35,080
This is commander luntz.

126
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,435
My friends call me luntz.

127
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:38,243
You are?

128
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:40,520
That's good. That's fine. You
don't have to say anything.

129
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,073
I can do all the talking for now.

130
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:43,866
I'm real good at these
one-sided conversations.

131
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:45,701
Just ask my ex-wife.

132
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:46,877
What about you? You married?

133
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:48,378
Get those guys away from the bank.

134
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:49,736
Tell them to get the hell back.

135
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:50,872
- I can do that.
- Do it now.

136
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:52,577
Well, you got to do
something for me then.

137
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:54,015
That's how these things work.

138
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:54,877
What?

139
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:56,854
How 'bout we start with a
name? You give me your name...

140
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:01,747
and I will back those guys so far up they'll have
to put two stamps on any letter they mail to you.

141
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:02,283
How's that?

142
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:04,197
Like he's just going
to give him his name.

143
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,442
Phil. That's good.

144
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:08,368
I've got a nephew named phillip.

145
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:09,275
Jeesh.

146
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:10,715
He's a real rascal.

147
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:12,665
He's got a killer arm
for an eight-year-old.

148
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:13,639
He plays right field.

149
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:15,989
What's your last name, phil?

150
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:17,741
Ga-- get
'em back!

151
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:19,653
Well, I just need to
know who I'm dealing with.

152
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:22,011
That's how I can help you.
Otherwise, these guys with the guns--

153
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:25,078
They get really... really nervous.

154
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:28,013
So, if we get to know each
other... we can be friends.

155
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:30,629
And then I can vouch for
you... and I can protect you.

156
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,882
I protect all my friends.

157
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:37,037
Stubbins.

158
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:38,240
- Stubbins.
- I'm on it.

159
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,978
My fiance, michael
lenhart... is in there.

160
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:42,004
He's a diabetic. He's
going to need to eat soon.

161
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:43,232
Help him, please.

162
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,618
Okay. Okay. Just stay calm.

163
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:50,957
Hey. There's a woman over
there who is hysterical.

164
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,632
Her fiance's inside. He's a diabetic.

165
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:55,340
There's a diabetic in there.

166
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:57,283
Uh, now look, phil.

167
00:08:57,323 --> 00:09:00,519
Nobody is in a rush here. I'm in this
for the long haul... as long as you are.

168
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,607
So we'll take our time.

169
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,841
But you have a bunch of
hungry people in there.

170
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:06,269
And you've got a young
guy who's a diabetic...

171
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:09,061
and his fiance is out
here worried about him.

172
00:09:09,101 --> 00:09:10,625
You know how women worry.

173
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:15,848
So it would go a long way if you let
me send you guys some food in there.

174
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,049
You like pizza?

175
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:25,231
That's because you don't
understand how protocol works...

176
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:28,916
and you may have gotten guster in real
trouble in there dialing his cell phone.

177
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:29,913
At least I did something.

178
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:32,424
Look, shawn. He is swat. And
he is good at what he does.

179
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:34,138
I am fine with backing off here.

180
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:35,679
He's swat! He's swat.

181
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:36,811
That's your argument?

182
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:37,986
He's not colin farrell.

183
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:39,984
I get that you are
concerned about gus...

184
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:43,198
but I can assure you
he is in capable hands.

185
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:48,117
There's a woman over there that says
her fiance has diabetes. He's inside.

186
00:09:48,757 --> 00:09:50,086
Wait a minute.

187
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:51,278
I get what's happening here.

188
00:09:51,318 --> 00:09:53,066
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

189
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:56,412
- I'm sensing a relationship here.
- You are?

190
00:09:56,452 --> 00:09:59,709
yes. You and luntz. There's
a familial thing happening.

191
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,885
He's like an older uncle.

192
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:02,187
What are you... related to him?

193
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,422
- Not yet.
- Lassiter.

194
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:04,933
What? He's psychic.
Shouldn't he know already?

195
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,132
Know what? What is he getting at?

196
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,426
It's nothing. But I do know cameron.

197
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:10,184
Luntz. Commander cameron luntz.

198
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:11,257
Cameron?

199
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:12,935
yes. And he's not my uncle.

200
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:15,448
I met him at a police
district conference...

201
00:10:15,488 --> 00:10:16,939
he asked me out... we
went on a few dates.

202
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:17,788
I like him.

203
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:18,647
Oh, my god.

204
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:20,228
You're dating this guy?

205
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:22,368
Ding, ding, ding. Tell
him what he won o'hara.

206
00:10:22,508 --> 00:10:24,028
Lassiter!

207
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:26,416
Look, shawn.
I was--

208
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,008
Don-- don't
worry. It's fine.

209
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:30,616
Jules, really. Dare I say, dandy?

210
00:10:30,656 --> 00:10:32,325
Isn't that a word from his generation?

211
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,751
That's not fair.

212
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:35,371
And look... I was going to talk
to you about it earlier... but--

213
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:37,383
It's great. It's--
it's really great.

214
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:40,465
Congratulations. I'm
so... So happy for you.

215
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:41,947
Now if you'll excuse me...

216
00:10:42,116 --> 00:10:43,961
I have a best friend to save.

217
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:49,606
Chief...

218
00:10:50,154 --> 00:10:51,815
elder commanding officer luntz...

219
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:53,091
you need to let me get involved here.

220
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:54,638
You need to let me scope things out.

221
00:10:54,678 --> 00:10:55,688
Absolutely not.

222
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:57,360
You're not a trained
tactical officer, spencer.

223
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,547
Are we positive he's
even house-trained?

224
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,170
Okay. All right.

225
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,769
Maybe you and I got
off on the wrong foot.

226
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:04,263
And you know what? You're correct.

227
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:06,973
I have had a few close calls
around the house recently...

228
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:08,272
but I can help you.

229
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:09,320
oh? How's that?

230
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,205
What do you know about this
guy... other than his name?

231
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:14,482
We know that he's a longtime
customer of this bank...

232
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:17,223
owed a huge load of
back taxes to the irs.

233
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:20,843
He's just had his house foreclosed
on. And he's a middle child.

234
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:24,160
You know he's a middle child?

235
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,060
I could hear it in the
timbre of his voice...

236
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,806
and the fact that he
doesn't use contractions...

237
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:32,103
okay. Fine. What about
everyone else in the bank?

238
00:11:32,143 --> 00:11:33,888
Look, you send your
guy in there, and what?

239
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:36,811
Maybe he gets you a guesstimate
of how many hostages there are?

240
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:38,001
I can walk into that bank.

241
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,321
I can psychically read every
single hostage andstubbins.

242
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:43,275
He's freaked out. He won't talk to you.

243
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:46,383
He doesn't need to...
I can read his mind.

244
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:48,063
Can you read my mind right now?

245
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:51,746
'cause it's sending a very clear
message where I want you to be.

246
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:58,378
sir.

247
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:00,625
Luntz here.

248
00:12:00,665 --> 00:12:02,122
Do you think I'm stupid?

249
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:04,050
- What are you talking about?
- I can see what you are doing.

250
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,823
You are sending a cop
in here with the pizzas.

251
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:07,164
Look, phil. Calm down now.

252
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:09,013
That's just for everybody's
safety, that's all.

253
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:10,223
Well, it is not happening.

254
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,964
I'll bring them up there
myself... if you like.

255
00:12:12,004 --> 00:12:15,143
I do not think so. You will
send in a regular person.

256
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,385
Regular person?

257
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:18,137
yes. A regular person.

258
00:12:18,177 --> 00:12:20,344
You will send in someone
from behind those barricades.

259
00:12:20,384 --> 00:12:24,612
A regular person. Not a cop.

260
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,983
What the hell is he doing?

261
00:12:48,623 --> 00:12:49,975
I wouldn't accept these if I were you.

262
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:51,630
Spencer.

263
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,589
Just put the pizzas down and
walk away. Get outta there.

264
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:56,852
Eight pies... four
of them are vegetable.

265
00:12:56,987 --> 00:12:58,813
Is this guy for real?

266
00:12:58,853 --> 00:13:00,983
No pepperoni? Really?

267
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:05,035
Plus the blatant disregard and utter
criminal lack of ham and pineapple.

268
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,296
- Spencer!
- What kind of good faith negotiation, is this?

269
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:09,810
I mean, this is a hostage negotiation.

270
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,840
Well, I don't care if you're
not happy with the ingredients!

271
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:14,662
Put the pizzas down and walk away!

272
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,073
I won't let you accept these.

273
00:13:17,113 --> 00:13:19,490
Walk away. This is my operation.

274
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:21,499
Go get him. Go get him out of there.

275
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:24,619
He's not going to
accept these-- aah!

276
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:28,829
Fan out, fan out, fan out!

277
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:30,594
Spencer!

278
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:35,474
Terrific.

279
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:40,081
Put those pizzas down right over there.

280
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:49,000
All right, phil.

281
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,156
I'm just as mad about this as you are.

282
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:54,276
Why don't you let me go out
there and make this right?

283
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:55,344
And on the way back in...

284
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:58,363
i'll have them throw in a couple liters of
old-fashioned root beer and some cinna-stars.

285
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:01,076
They're like cinna-dots...
they're just-- they're pointy.

286
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:02,332
They're good. They're not great.

287
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:04,295
But I can get them... free of charge.

288
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:05,517
I'll be right back.

289
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:07,776
You're not going anywhere.

290
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:10,077
You just become the next hostage.

291
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:21,958
Why does he keep separating everybody?

292
00:14:21,998 --> 00:14:24,951
Jules is dating an old swat guy?

293
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:27,553
We're in a hostage situation... shawn.

294
00:14:27,593 --> 00:14:29,567
- You don't get that?
- I do get it.

295
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:32,311
What I don't get is the
bulletproof vest over the shirt.

296
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:33,820
- What is that?
- I'm telling you.

297
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,601
Something's not right with this guy.

298
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,730
And then he makes us take our shoes off?

299
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,663
Who does that? why?

300
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:41,756
It's a way of containg people.

301
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:43,587
You know, slowing them down and whatnot.

302
00:14:43,627 --> 00:14:46,136
So we can't run away when
he starts shooting us.

303
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,676
He's going to start killing
us off... one-by-one.

304
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:50,761
- Oh, my god.
- Would you please relax?

305
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:52,624
Clearly, I have a
handle on the situation.

306
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:54,123
A handle? A handle!

307
00:14:54,163 --> 00:14:56,805
You mouthed off to him and
got yourself taken hostage.

308
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:58,743
Of course I did. That
was my plan all along...

309
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:00,422
you sweet dollop of spicy goodness.

310
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:03,354
I had to get myself in there... so
I could see what I'm dealing with.

311
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,694
And I have this feeling that we are not
dealing with the person they think we are.

312
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:13,315
Why would a bank robber
keep his gun safety on?

313
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:15,077
So help me out.

314
00:15:15,435 --> 00:15:16,645
Think.

315
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:20,155
What do you remember seeing the
moment that the robbery went down?

316
00:15:20,297 --> 00:15:21,877
Features?

317
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:23,831
Noses? Maybe a chin.

318
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:25,780
I did see a chin.

319
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,233
A beautiful one.

320
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:31,540
A glorious one.

321
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:33,883
There's a good chance
she's over a hundred.

322
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:35,381
Are you sure you've
thought this through?

323
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:36,610
Not her, shawn.

324
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,962
I've had a lot of time
to think in here, shawn.

325
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:42,633
And I've realized
some things about life.

326
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:44,347
It's been two hours.

327
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:47,039
Yes. But two hours "hostage" time.

328
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,066
Things happen fast in here shawn.

329
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:50,967
Life is fleeting...

330
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:52,415
and I need to live it.

331
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:54,176
I need to say the things I'm feeling...

332
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:56,690
and act on those feelings
before it's too late.

333
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,282
And so do you.

334
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:00,402
Okay.

335
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:03,954
In other news, phil.

336
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:04,688
Phil!

337
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:07,333
What are you doing? You
want to get yourself shot?

338
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:08,536
What?

339
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:09,703
Sorry. Nothing.

340
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:10,601
Our bad.

341
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:13,207
You just go back to your
whole "robbering" thing.

342
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:15,455
I need to potty.

343
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:18,298
I- I'm-i'm sorry.
I'm sorry, everyone.

344
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:21,404
I downed an orange julius right
before I was taken captive.

345
00:16:21,444 --> 00:16:22,223
And
it--

346
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:24,855
It went right through me.

347
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:26,761
I need to potty.

348
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:28,999
Look-- I
know my body.

349
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,685
And I know my stomach.

350
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:32,069
And this could get really ugly.

351
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:34,689
All right... all right, all right.

352
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:36,443
All right, don't anybody
move. I'm watching you.

353
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:39,074
I'm just going to be
right here. Don't move.

354
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,838
You know I'm not really a
regular person. Right, phil?

355
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:46,042
What does that mean?

356
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:47,750
It means I tried once and failed.

357
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,880
I'm just too unique and interesting.

358
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,841
The french call it du fromage.

359
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:54,757
Which loosely translated
means "of cheese."

360
00:16:55,357 --> 00:16:57,439
The truth is... i'm actually a psychic.

361
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:59,122
A professional one.

362
00:16:59,162 --> 00:17:02,821
And I am getting a major
reading. Right in here.

363
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:04,385
You are?

364
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:05,593
- There it goes again.
- What?

365
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:08,066
- What's it saying?
- It's saying that you are a middle child.

366
00:17:10,636 --> 00:17:11,471
Yes, yes I am.

367
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:14,734
It is also saying that you are not...

368
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:16,528
A bank robber.

369
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:25,420
- You know this?
- yes. Very much so.

370
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,344
There is something
else at play here, phil.

371
00:17:27,384 --> 00:17:28,770
Something nefarious.

372
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,898
And also evil.

373
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:33,465
Oh, god, yes.

374
00:17:33,623 --> 00:17:34,958
- You do know.
- All right. Okay.

375
00:17:34,998 --> 00:17:36,906
I can't keep up this ruse any longer.

376
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:39,004
- Please.How's my wife?
- Your wife?

377
00:17:39,044 --> 00:17:41,426
- Yeah, is she scared?
- Is she scared?

378
00:17:41,873 --> 00:17:44,022
Uh...yes... she is scared.

379
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:44,731
Oh, my god.

380
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:46,840
Joanna, I'm so sorry.

381
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,211
Can you get a message to her?

382
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:53,455
Yes, I believe I can.

383
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:54,530
Joanna.

384
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,699
Joanna.

385
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:57,308
Listen, joanna.

386
00:17:57,348 --> 00:17:58,775
This morning I was
confronted by a man...

387
00:17:58,815 --> 00:17:59,860
I don't know who.

388
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,137
And he told me that he had kidnapped
you and was holding you somewhere.

389
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:06,013
And if I didn't walk into this bank
right then and get him these diamonds...

390
00:18:06,014 --> 00:18:07,737
and drop them in a
mailbox down the road...

391
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:09,926
he was going to kill you.

392
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:12,099
And I screwed up.

393
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:16,379
And I don't know how to get out
of this, honey. I'm so sorry.

394
00:18:18,255 --> 00:18:20,561
Phil, that was something.

395
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:23,762
I mean, it was just really
jam-packed with, uh... information.

396
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,862
It was also a little breathy.

397
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:27,347
Oddly soothing.

398
00:18:27,387 --> 00:18:28,420
She said not to worry.

399
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,250
Everything is going to be okay.

400
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,187
But how?

401
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:32,892
- You don't have to...
- Okay, yeah.

402
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:34,264
But how?

403
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:35,772
I mean, I feel like I'm being watched.

404
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:38,886
By the cops... by someone in here.

405
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:42,105
Phil, I will help you.

406
00:18:42,145 --> 00:18:43,751
But you have to trust me.

407
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,012
I'm working with the police department.

408
00:18:46,052 --> 00:18:48,751
I know who all the
players are out there.

409
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,544
I will get you out of this bank.

410
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:52,586
And I will find out where your wife is.

411
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:56,166
But you have to let me
lead this negotiation.

412
00:18:57,175 --> 00:18:58,919
Do you think you can do that?

413
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,139
I think so.

414
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,063
Okay, here's the plan...

415
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:03,195
First, keep up the crazy guy routine.

416
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:04,322
- We need that.
- All right.

417
00:19:04,362 --> 00:19:07,315
But do not speak to anyone
here unless I am with you.

418
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,181
Secondly...

419
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:11,247
You're going to have
to give me some privacy.

420
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:13,448
I wasn't kidding about
the orange julius.

421
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:25,212
Luntz here.

422
00:19:25,252 --> 00:19:26,577
I have some info for you.

423
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:28,480
Stubbins is not behind this.

424
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,866
- Someone-- -
Look, spencer.

425
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:33,722
The first thing you gotta realize about these
guys is that they will try to manipulate anybody...

426
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:35,208
they can to get out of there alive.

427
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:38,569
I think that you have interfered
and screwed up enough... don't you?

428
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:42,940
Why don't you find yourself a quiet
little corner in there and lay low, copy?

429
00:19:43,194 --> 00:19:45,467
I- I'm
tell--

430
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:47,121
Kenny... I need to talk to you.

431
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:49,133
Yes, sir. What's up, sir?

432
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:52,087
- Hello?
- Lhasa apsos...

433
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:56,357
I have an idea that might put you
back front and center on this case.

434
00:19:56,514 --> 00:19:57,290
I'm listening.

435
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,843
Stubbins isn't behind the robbery.

436
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:01,059
Somebody kidnapped his
wife and put him up to it.

437
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:03,734
Spencer, you know that
sounds a little nutsy, right?

438
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:07,657
What do you have to lose? Just send a couple black and
whites out to look for the wife and see what blows back.

439
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:11,077
How can you be so sure that
sh-- What was that sound?

440
00:20:11,774 --> 00:20:14,531
Spencer?

441
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:18,537
Hey, mcnabb.

442
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,224
Yes, sir.

443
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:22,688
I've got something I'm
going to send you out on.

444
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:23,951
Okay.

445
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:26,631
What are we doing in the
bank manager's office?

446
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:30,867
I've taken the liberty of putting together
a list of demands that you can give to luntz.

447
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:32,742
- Demands?
- yep.

448
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:34,098
Yeah, we're going to call out there.

449
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:37,482
And you're just going
to read these off to him.

450
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:39,612
"my demands...

451
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:41,316
By phil."

452
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:43,989
An airplane to take me wherever I want.

453
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:47,147
Tour bus, blue... with
full tank of gas...

454
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:49,491
- and groupies. -
That's non-negotiable.

455
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,338
$5.000... in unmarked bills.

456
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:53,312
This is a huge list.

457
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,023
What if they won't give
me any of this stuff?

458
00:20:55,063 --> 00:20:56,869
I don't expect them to... phil.

459
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:58,207
That's just to buy us time.

460
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,146
So that we can figure out who
in here has put you up to this.

461
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:03,494
A zip line pulley system
used to transport...

462
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:07,145
deliciously flavored snacks and
such from one location to another.

463
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:07,913
What is this?

464
00:21:07,953 --> 00:21:09,638
Look, just call out to luntz, okay?

465
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:12,647
And remember... I need
to speak to him first.

466
00:21:16,512 --> 00:21:18,940
What do you know about this
guy... other than his name?

467
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,496
We know that his house foreclosed on.

468
00:21:21,574 --> 00:21:23,733
Luntz, it's phil.

469
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:25,311
Hey there, friend.

470
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,230
I was wondering why I
haven't heard from you.

471
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,039
Well, I'm going to
put-- Shawn spencer?

472
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,145
Shawn spencer on the phone.

473
00:21:32,185 --> 00:21:34,723
He will be negotiating on
my behalf from here on in.

474
00:21:34,763 --> 00:21:35,971
No. No, phil.

475
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:37,465
Don't do that. That's a mistake.

476
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,415
- This is between you
and me-- - Hey, cam!

477
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,693
It's shawn. What's up, buddy?

478
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,420
Spencer, put stubbins on the phone now.

479
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:46,839
That's, uh...

480
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:49,611
That's going to be a little awkward,
uh-- I'm not really sure how to put this.

481
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:52,726
And bear with me... because this
is my first hostage negotiation...

482
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:56,468
but it would appear that i am,
in fact... making the demands now.

483
00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:58,504
So why don't you go
ahead and put detective...

484
00:21:58,544 --> 00:22:00,887
O'hara on the phone please.

485
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,313
Why in the worid would I do that?

486
00:22:02,353 --> 00:22:06,106
Oh, I don't know. Isn't the
"timbre" of my voice telling you why?

487
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:13,325
It's spencer.

488
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:16,318
Shawn, are you all right?

489
00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:18,939
Jules, how serious is this
thing with you and luntz? Really?

490
00:22:19,434 --> 00:22:21,792
I'm so not having this
conversation with you right now.

491
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:24,312
Is he standing next to you...
sniffing your hair... huh?

492
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:25,738
is he listening to me?

493
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,548
Shawn, half the santa barbara
police department can hear us.

494
00:22:28,872 --> 00:22:29,988
Okay, fine. You're right.

495
00:22:30,028 --> 00:22:31,750
I'm sorry. I don't know
what I was thinking.

496
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,553
Just... Just answer me this.

497
00:22:34,593 --> 00:22:38,683
Does he have those older guy boobies
that sort of droop at the ends?

498
00:22:38,723 --> 00:22:39,797
Okay, I'm hanging up on you now.

499
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:42,328
Wh-wh-whoa! Hold on, hold
on. I'm putting phil--

500
00:22:42,368 --> 00:22:45,741
I'm putting phil on for luntz.

501
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,318
- Hey there, buddy. You there?
- Yeah.

502
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:50,716
Okay.

503
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:51,888
First...

504
00:22:51,928 --> 00:22:54,302
I need a plane.

505
00:23:01,076 --> 00:23:03,250
Oh, gosh.

506
00:23:09,174 --> 00:23:12,026
This bank sucks.

507
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,174
Wait a minute.

508
00:23:14,214 --> 00:23:15,485
You're the bank manager.

509
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:18,097
yes. I'm nathanial gresling.

510
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,616
Do you recall rejecting
a small business loan...

511
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,612
for a zip line snack transportation
system... calling it...

512
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,271
and I quote... "fiscally irresponsible"?

513
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:27,928
- Shawn.
- Yes, I do.

514
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:30,567
Well... mr. Nathanial gresling...

515
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:34,286
this little task of retrieving
the mini oreos took me 14 seconds.

516
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:36,221
Zip line... Foom! Shh!

517
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:37,251
Five.

518
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,578
Fiscally irresponsible?

519
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:42,442
Nay, I call that my fiscal obligation
to my shareholders... namely gus here.

520
00:23:42,482 --> 00:23:44,036
- Shawn.
- Look, I'm sorry.

521
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:45,759
You think that was all my decisión?

522
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,961
I'm just a dupe for
the upper management.

523
00:23:48,342 --> 00:23:50,121
I don't have the power you think I do.

524
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:52,329
We understand... mr. Gresling.

525
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,817
But I'm still a little
fuzzy on the details.

526
00:23:54,857 --> 00:23:58,414
Do you rember what happened this morning
when Mr. Stubbins came to the bank?

527
00:23:58,454 --> 00:24:01,682
I remember him entering the
bank... and he approached me.

528
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:06,418
I was busy with a customer...
but he caught my attention.

529
00:24:10,286 --> 00:24:14,194
He asked me to take him to the
safety deposit vault... which I did.

530
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:17,584
Once inside the
vault... he drew his gun.

531
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,144
How do you suppose he
knew about the diamonds?

532
00:24:23,184 --> 00:24:27,082
The diamonds were deposited in
that particular box one week prior.

533
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:31,586
I very distinctly remember Mr.
Stubbins being in the bank that day.

534
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:34,399
How do you distinctly remember that?

535
00:24:34,936 --> 00:24:39,513
Well, the gentleman who deposited the
diamonds was a very wealthy customer...

536
00:24:39,614 --> 00:24:42,771
who management considers
to be a v.i.p. Client.

537
00:24:42,811 --> 00:24:45,377
Therefore, I'm instructed
to treat him as such.

538
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,252
Right.

539
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:49,593
Mr. Stubbins was in the bank before...

540
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:52,566
to get to his safety deposit
box... but I skipped him over.

541
00:24:52,606 --> 00:24:54,455
Oh, that never feels good.

542
00:24:54,602 --> 00:24:56,070
He was very upset.

543
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,288
He complained.

544
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,688
I felt bad for him, and...

545
00:24:59,728 --> 00:25:01,171
maybe this was my mistake...

546
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:06,341
but I told him that the gentleman was
depositing some very valuable merchandise.

547
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,544
Therefore he knew about the diamonds.

548
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:12,018
Don't beat yourself up,
man. It's not your fault.

549
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:14,037
Thank you very much.

550
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:15,688
god.

551
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:20,043
Nothing is agreeing with me today.

552
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,863
Excuse me, I'm going to have to, uh...

553
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:25,840
Take care of some more business.

554
00:25:35,204 --> 00:25:37,265
Phil. Buddy. What're you doing?

555
00:25:37,305 --> 00:25:39,778
They're going to meet all my demands.

556
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,489
Seriously? Even the plane?

557
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:42,407
Yeah.

558
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:43,847
What about the snack line?

559
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:45,092
Yeah.

560
00:25:45,132 --> 00:25:47,031
Um, they wanted me to come
take a look at the bus.

561
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:49,118
It's not blue. Is that okay?

562
00:25:49,158 --> 00:25:49,915
Yeah.

563
00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:52,157
You have a shot, take it.

564
00:26:04,538 --> 00:26:06,055
That's a negative on the target, sir.

565
00:26:06,256 --> 00:26:07,300
How did you miss?

566
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:09,856
<i>He just fell out of
my scope. Very strange.</i>

567
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:24,092
Free hugs. Who's next?

568
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:27,632
Well, we're still coming to you from
outside the national savings bank...

569
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:30,085
where the hostage
situation has escalated.

570
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:33,742
Shawn spencer... psychic detective for
the santa barbara police department...

571
00:26:33,782 --> 00:26:35,494
is now inside the bank.

572
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:37,384
- And is not only a hostage...
- You got to be kidding me.

573
00:26:37,624 --> 00:26:41,630
he appears to be calling the shots on
behalf of the now-named assailant...

574
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,013
phillip stubbins.

575
00:26:43,053 --> 00:26:45,894
Oh, this can't be good.

576
00:26:50,623 --> 00:26:53,103
Dude, don't even sit by me right now.

577
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:54,688
They already hate me
for the phone thing.

578
00:26:54,728 --> 00:26:58,289
I don't need them to know i'm friends with
the guy that kept them from being rescued.

579
00:26:58,329 --> 00:26:59,546
Okay. You know something?

580
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:01,833
Maybe... before you admonish
me with that tone of voice...

581
00:27:01,873 --> 00:27:03,652
you'd like to hear
my insanely good news.

582
00:27:03,692 --> 00:27:04,531
What?

583
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:08,155
As a sign of cooperation... phil
and I are going to release a hostage.

584
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,121
- Are you happy now?
- Yes! Yes, yes, yes yes, yes.

585
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:11,961
Okay.

586
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:13,994
I knew you would get
me released. Thank you!

587
00:27:14,323 --> 00:27:15,930
W
- wait, dude... it's not you.

588
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,189
What?

589
00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:19,149
Think about it for a minute.

590
00:27:19,883 --> 00:27:21,309
Oh, my god.

591
00:27:21,495 --> 00:27:22,248
Oh, my god.

592
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:23,633
I'm a horrible person.

593
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:25,452
There's older people
here and-- and women.

594
00:27:25,492 --> 00:27:27,583
Shawn...are you ready?

595
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,974
Phil, I will be with you in one minute.

596
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:34,756
What?

597
00:27:34,796 --> 00:27:36,435
You are the hostage being released?

598
00:27:36,475 --> 00:27:38,135
- Gus-- - I can't
believe this.

599
00:27:38,175 --> 00:27:40,663
I have a hunch about where
phil's wife is being held.

600
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,697
I think it's directly linked to a list
of foreclosed houses in the area...

601
00:27:43,737 --> 00:27:45,434
and I have to check
it out. Don't you see?

602
00:27:45,474 --> 00:27:46,492
It's got to be me.

603
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:48,105
Just figure this out
and get me out of here...

604
00:27:48,106 --> 00:27:50,873
before there's a red laser
light shining on my forehead.

605
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:52,540
And be careful, shawn.

606
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,039
I will, buddy.

607
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,759
Oh, and shawn...

608
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,070
I just want you to know...

609
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,939
That no matter what happens...

610
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:03,648
I care about you and I appreciate you.

611
00:28:03,688 --> 00:28:04,740
And, well...

612
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:07,792
I love you, shawn.

613
00:28:14,907 --> 00:28:15,712
Okay, buddy.

614
00:28:17,158 --> 00:28:18,601
I hear ya.

615
00:28:18,641 --> 00:28:21,621
You know I'm going to be back
in, like, half an hour, right?

616
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:25,713
Wow, that is a tight hug.

617
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:28,435
All right.

618
00:28:28,844 --> 00:28:30,694
All right.

619
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:32,868
Okay.

620
00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:35,547
- Okay, I'm pretty sure
gresling is our guy.

621
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:36,348
- You are?

622
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:38,814
Yeah, this morning when
you walked into the bank...

623
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:40,346
you didn't find him.

624
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,128
He found you.

625
00:28:44,034 --> 00:28:46,466
His hands were quicker than your gun.

626
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:48,768
- What?
- Just stay away from him.

627
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:50,152
Say nothing.

628
00:28:50,192 --> 00:28:51,818
Do not pick up the bank line.

629
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:54,486
Do not field any calls until I return...

630
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:56,742
- okay?
- All right.

631
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,860
Shawn?

632
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:01,049
I love my wife.

633
00:29:02,122 --> 00:29:03,689
I know you do, man.

634
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,736
All right... go get him.

635
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:24,619
All right, put him in a holding bin.

636
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:25,429
I want to debrief him.

637
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:26,556
N
- no way, luntz.

638
00:29:26,596 --> 00:29:28,733
This is our guy. Any debriefing
is going to be done by us.

639
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:30,392
No, this is my investigation.

640
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:32,582
Well, guys, guys! I appreciate
you arguing over me...

641
00:29:32,622 --> 00:29:34,215
but let me just point out...

642
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,640
I'm not wearing briefs.

643
00:29:35,893 --> 00:29:36,944
Commander luntz...

644
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,404
Mr. Spencer is in our department...

645
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,997
so we will debrief him first.

646
00:29:40,037 --> 00:29:42,063
But we'll share any
information that we gather.

647
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:44,441
Hands off.

648
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:46,442
Shawn! Shawn.

649
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:48,685
dad?

650
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:49,955
Hurry up.

651
00:29:49,995 --> 00:29:50,795
What are you doing down here?

652
00:29:50,835 --> 00:29:53,112
Look, I don't know what you and
gus have gotten yourselves into...

653
00:29:53,152 --> 00:29:54,347
but I came down here to warn you.

654
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,209
Warn me of what?

655
00:29:55,249 --> 00:29:57,007
This guy doing the negotiating?

656
00:29:57,118 --> 00:29:58,704
He's done negotiating.

657
00:29:58,903 --> 00:29:59,464
Meaning?

658
00:29:59,504 --> 00:30:00,865
He's getting ready to take this guy out.

659
00:30:00,905 --> 00:30:01,775
Yeah, dad, I know.

660
00:30:01,815 --> 00:30:03,016
- He already took a shot.
- Yes, but shawn...

661
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:04,522
he's getting ready to
go in with tear gas.

662
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:06,296
I've seen it before. It's not pretty.

663
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,588
How much time do I have?

664
00:30:08,628 --> 00:30:09,661
I don't know...

665
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:11,066
Hour, tops.

666
00:30:11,473 --> 00:30:12,834
All right. Thanks, dad.

667
00:30:12,835 --> 00:30:14,000
Shawn...

668
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:16,571
- You be careful.
- All right.

669
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,725
Hi. Shawn spencer.

670
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:24,941
- Thanks for coming out.
- Shawn.

671
00:30:27,652 --> 00:30:30,735
Look, lassie... I am telling you
that stubbins is not behind this.

672
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:33,877
And I know at the very least that
gresling... the bank manager... is involved.

673
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,000
It's a moot point. He's going
to do what he's going to do.

674
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,746
- There are hostages in there.
- I know that.

675
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:38,969
My best friend is one of them.

676
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,525
If we can get out of here
and find this guy's wife...

677
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:43,567
we can show that the
kidnapping thing holds water.

678
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:46,167
Look, I am breaking about 50
codes of police procedure...

679
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:47,302
just by talking to you about this.

680
00:30:47,342 --> 00:30:48,969
Ugh! With the codes! That
is your biggest problem.

681
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:49,870
oh... It's my problem?

682
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,577
Just once... can you grab life by the
little lassiters and follow your instincts?

683
00:30:54,057 --> 00:30:55,426
I know you don't like my methods.

684
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:56,420
I know you don't like me.

685
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,875
But we are pressed for time... and I
am telling you I am vibing like crazy.

686
00:30:59,915 --> 00:31:03,060
Can we screw protocol and
get the hell outta here?

687
00:31:07,914 --> 00:31:09,510
You take shotgun.

688
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,369
You are so sexy right now.

689
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:23,469
Where you going?

690
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:26,667
I'm sorry, but you're not the
only one here who has a job to do.

691
00:31:26,707 --> 00:31:28,557
Well, wait. Are we still on for tonight?

692
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:33,674
All right, where am I driving?

693
00:31:33,714 --> 00:31:35,081
Just head down to state street.

694
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,595
Then you're going to be
making a left on laporte.

695
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,938
Yes. Left.

696
00:31:40,978 --> 00:31:43,277
I'm being drawn there by the wife now.

697
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:46,142
All right, jules. Give me one good
reason why you find this guy attractive.

698
00:31:46,182 --> 00:31:47,791
- Shawn!
- You can't give me one?

699
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:48,675
I can think of many.

700
00:31:48,715 --> 00:31:51,457
Is one of them that you're looking forward
to giving him sponge baths in the near future?

701
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:54,290
I happen to find his age
and his maturity appealing.

702
00:31:54,395 --> 00:31:56,607
He's distinguished... and
virile... and most importantly...

703
00:31:56,647 --> 00:31:57,458
he knows who he is.

704
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,904
And that... Is attractive.

705
00:31:58,944 --> 00:32:00,474
You two know i'm in the van, right?

706
00:32:00,514 --> 00:32:01,779
Here! Stop here!

707
00:32:05,944 --> 00:32:06,806
This is it.

708
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:08,281
She's being held right in there.

709
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:09,585
All right, spencer.

710
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:10,845
You.stay put.

711
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:12,725
I will not be responsible for you.

712
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,138
O'hara, we go on three. You ready?

713
00:32:14,178 --> 00:32:15,959
One,
two--

714
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:17,632
Can I say it?

715
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:19,462
Let me say it.

716
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:47,589
Shawn!

717
00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:48,652
Get back in the car.

718
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:49,473
This could be dangerous.

719
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:50,582
I will, but I have
to tell you something.

720
00:32:50,622 --> 00:32:51,676
Shawn... get back in the car.

721
00:32:51,716 --> 00:32:52,918
Go out with luntz.

722
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:55,259
- What?
- I want you to go out with luntz.

723
00:32:56,127 --> 00:32:57,372
Shawn...

724
00:32:57,412 --> 00:32:58,462
What are you trying to pull?

725
00:32:58,502 --> 00:33:01,642
I'm not trying to pull anything.
I just want you to be happy.

726
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:02,720
So...

727
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:05,667
if you think this guy can make you
happy... or even if you're not sure...

728
00:33:05,707 --> 00:33:07,172
and there's just a tiny part of you...

729
00:33:07,212 --> 00:33:08,614
that thinks that there
might be a chance for that...

730
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,729
I think you owe it to
yourself to go for it.

731
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:14,784
Thank you, shawn.

732
00:33:14,824 --> 00:33:15,946
You're welcome.

733
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:17,625
When are you supposed to go out next?

734
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:19,349
Uh, tonight... actually.

735
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:21,232
That's so fast.

736
00:33:21,712 --> 00:33:22,686
Where's he going to take you?

737
00:33:22,726 --> 00:33:23,558
Mario's.

738
00:33:23,598 --> 00:33:24,859
Mario's?

739
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:26,712
That place is a little
stuffy. Don't you think?

740
00:33:26,752 --> 00:33:28,187
I like their bread.

741
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,428
- Clear.
- Clear.

742
00:33:38,468 --> 00:33:39,633
- Spen--
- Spencer...

743
00:33:39,673 --> 00:33:41,485
what the hell are you doing?
I told you to stay in the car.

744
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:49,936
If I'd stayed in the car... I
wouldn't be able to tell you...

745
00:33:49,976 --> 00:33:51,901
that someone just took off
running that way through the yard.

746
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,117
They're gone.

747
00:33:55,157 --> 00:33:57,451
I'll call in a perimeter
request. Get k-9 down here.

748
00:33:57,491 --> 00:33:59,044
You want to help me with this gag?

749
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:01,049
Yeah.

750
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:03,741
Hello, joanna.

751
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:06,228
I have a message from your husband.

752
00:34:06,855 --> 00:34:09,453
I'm going to try to make
contact one more time...

753
00:34:09,493 --> 00:34:10,402
and then that's it.

754
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:12,607
Prepare to go in with the gas.

755
00:34:28,827 --> 00:34:30,923
you. Come on. Come on, right now.

756
00:34:30,963 --> 00:34:32,282
- why? What do you want?
- Right now.

757
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:34,815
Don't move! Don't
talk! Look at the floor!

758
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:35,819
Look at the floor.

759
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:36,967
Come on. Right now.

760
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:38,638
Right now. In here, in here.

761
00:34:38,678 --> 00:34:40,548
- Get in there.
- What?

762
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:45,544
- You have my wife.
- What are you talking about?

763
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:47,690
You know where she is.
Tell me where she is.

764
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:51,001
- Tell me where she is.
- I swear-- you're crazy.

765
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:52,822
Where's my wife?!

766
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:55,334
I don't know!

767
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,780
All right, Mrs. Stubbins. What can you
tell us about the man that kidnapped you?

768
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,383
Well, there were actually two men.

769
00:35:02,689 --> 00:35:04,059
two?

770
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:06,106
Are you sure?

771
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:07,748
Where's my wife?

772
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:19,062
I was blindfolded... but
through a crack in the bottom...

773
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:21,474
I was able to make
out two pairs of feet.

774
00:35:21,514 --> 00:35:22,558
I didn't see much, but...

775
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:26,062
I know one of them was wearing
a pair of brown wing tip shoes.

776
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:44,427
I got it. The other one's in the bank.

777
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:46,727
I gotta call phil and warn him.

778
00:36:00,344 --> 00:36:01,573
That's it, men.

779
00:36:01,613 --> 00:36:03,079
It's go time.

780
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,500
Hit 'em with the teargas
and go in on my call.

781
00:36:19,168 --> 00:36:21,788
Morgan phelps is the
second man inside the bank.

782
00:36:21,828 --> 00:36:23,836
Canine caught the guy running away
from the house... who gave them up.

783
00:36:23,837 --> 00:36:25,280
But I don't get the bank manager.

784
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,418
Gresling knew the bank
was going to be robbed?

785
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:29,105
He planned the whole
thing from the beginning.

786
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,521
He knew that his v.i.p. Client
had dropped off the diamonds.

787
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:34,819
The diamonds were deposited in
that particular box one week prior.

788
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,676
He figured this was
his chance to score big.

789
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:38,805
So he contacted morgan phelps.

790
00:36:38,806 --> 00:36:40,983
Who has a rap sheet as long as my arm.

791
00:36:40,984 --> 00:36:42,978
So why didn't phelps just
steal the diamonds himself?

792
00:36:43,018 --> 00:36:44,500
They didn't need a
professional bank robber...

793
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:47,212
because gresling would basically
just be handing the diamonds over.

794
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,612
And phil was a perfect mark.

795
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:50,622
They could put him in the bank on
the day the diamonds were delivered.

796
00:36:50,662 --> 00:36:52,773
That, plus the back taxes...
and the recent foreclosure...

797
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:55,903
made him seem like a really desperate
guy who need cash in a big way.

798
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,623
So phelps plants himself at the bank
to make sure everything goes smoothly...

799
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:01,237
and then finds himself caught as a
hostage when the whole deal goes south.

800
00:37:01,277 --> 00:37:02,305
I'll keep trying luntz...

801
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,849
but I'm pretty sure he's blocked all
calls not coming from inside the bank.

802
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,924
We need to get back
there before he goes in.

803
00:37:19,442 --> 00:37:20,426
Luntz!

804
00:37:20,466 --> 00:37:22,223
Have your guys grab
gresling... the bank manager.

805
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,782
Take him into custody. He's in on it.

806
00:37:23,822 --> 00:37:25,252
- We're looking for phelps.
- who?

807
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:26,794
Phelps. Have you accounted
for all the hostages?

808
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,633
We're counting bodies
now. It's a mess out here.

809
00:37:28,673 --> 00:37:29,757
All right.

810
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,324
There's no wing tips.

811
00:37:36,364 --> 00:37:37,895
Phelps is gone. He must've
taken off somewhere.

812
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:38,772
When did you last see him?

813
00:37:38,812 --> 00:37:40,601
We were being held in a back room.

814
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:52,120
- I know where phelps is.
- Where?

815
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,429
He's in the sewer. He's
in the sewer system.

816
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:56,236
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it, luntz?

817
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:57,209
All right, I do know this much.

818
00:37:57,249 --> 00:37:59,261
If someone were to access
the sewer system out back...

819
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:00,643
it would dump them almost
anywhere in the city.

820
00:38:00,683 --> 00:38:01,770
Luntz, I'm a psychic.

821
00:38:01,851 --> 00:38:02,956
You're just going to have to trust me.

822
00:38:02,996 --> 00:38:04,108
Plus, listen to my voice.

823
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:06,234
It's even. It's steady. No vibrato.

824
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:15,642
Gus, quick. Help me boost
lassie up to the ceiling.

825
00:38:15,682 --> 00:38:17,616
- Phelps is inside one of these ducts.
- What?

826
00:38:17,656 --> 00:38:19,886
Whatever happened to the whole
psychic sewer visión thing?

827
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:21,536
Lassie, do we really have
time to answer these questions?

828
00:38:21,576 --> 00:38:24,680
Now, come on. Just give me
one of those size 12 narrows.

829
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:41,657
Freeze!

830
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:45,355
Come here.

831
00:38:48,568 --> 00:38:49,585
Hold still.

832
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:51,180
I got him!

833
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,338
Good work, partner.

834
00:38:52,378 --> 00:38:53,567
We'll grab backup.

835
00:38:58,354 --> 00:38:59,302
Partner?

836
00:38:59,342 --> 00:39:01,286
Uh, excuse me. What was that about?

837
00:39:01,326 --> 00:39:03,849
You got to admit... it's
better than a little boy cat...

838
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:04,752
Or a little girl cat.

839
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:05,981
Not appreciated, shawn.

840
00:39:06,021 --> 00:39:07,168
But look at you, man...

841
00:39:07,316 --> 00:39:10,388
surviving a bank hostage
crisis and still looking all...

842
00:39:10,428 --> 00:39:12,038
poitier on a hot day.

843
00:39:12,078 --> 00:39:13,198
What?

844
00:39:13,238 --> 00:39:14,866
Go ahead. Slap me in the face.

845
00:39:14,906 --> 00:39:16,179
Tell me they call you Mr. Tibbs.

846
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:17,327
- I'm not doing that.
- Come on...

847
00:39:17,367 --> 00:39:18,393
it'll make you feel better.

848
00:39:18,555 --> 00:39:20,461
They call
me mr.--

849
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:22,843
I'm not doing that.

850
00:39:22,883 --> 00:39:24,549
But you were one word away! Come on.

851
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:26,308
- What do they call you?
- Will you get in the car?

852
00:39:26,348 --> 00:39:27,862
They call you what?

853
00:39:28,071 --> 00:39:32,235
They call
you mr.--

854
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:41,197
Jules.

855
00:39:41,237 --> 00:39:42,267
hi.

856
00:39:43,718 --> 00:39:45,362
What are
you---

857
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:47,716
Uh, evidence turned these over to me.

858
00:39:47,756 --> 00:39:49,351
I think they're gus's shoes.

859
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:50,551
So...

860
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,062
I just,
um--

861
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:55,355
I thought i'd bring them
by and drop them off.

862
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:56,865
That is very sweet of you.

863
00:39:58,291 --> 00:40:00,078
- You can burn them.
- What?

864
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:02,218
He was devastated the whole way home.

865
00:40:02,258 --> 00:40:03,476
He cried about them already.

866
00:40:03,516 --> 00:40:05,381
On my shoulder... like a baby.

867
00:40:05,421 --> 00:40:07,523
I just put him down. He's resting now.

868
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:08,511
So what is this?

869
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:10,360
What am I seeing here?

870
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,532
This is the uh...

871
00:40:11,572 --> 00:40:13,542
"returning footwear to a friend" outfit?

872
00:40:14,008 --> 00:40:15,603
Oh, cameron had to cancel tonight.

873
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,001
no.

874
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,102
Yeah.

875
00:40:18,142 --> 00:40:19,343
- no!
- Yeah.

876
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:22,124
He said he took, like...
four showers, but...

877
00:40:22,164 --> 00:40:25,222
he still couldn't get that
sewer smell out of his skin.

878
00:40:25,262 --> 00:40:27,465
Aw, jeez! That damn sewer!

879
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,585
We wrapped everything up so
nicely so that you guys could...

880
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:33,799
But you know what? The
man followed a hunch.

881
00:40:33,955 --> 00:40:35,338
And that's all you can ask from a guy.

882
00:40:35,378 --> 00:40:37,797
Hey, follow your hunches. And he did.

883
00:40:37,981 --> 00:40:39,760
I'm sorry it didn't
work out for you kids.

884
00:40:40,211 --> 00:40:42,756
But you gave it a
real shot, a fair shot.

885
00:40:42,796 --> 00:40:44,725
Shawn, I'm seeing him tomorrow night.

886
00:40:45,022 --> 00:40:46,546
Really? wow.That's...

887
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:49,229
so fast on the rescheduling.

888
00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:50,611
It's-- No
conflicts?

889
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:52,003
Either way?

890
00:40:53,777 --> 00:40:55,867
Yeah, we'll see.

891
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:00,441
Well, I should go.

892
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,661
Hey, uh, have you eaten?

893
00:41:03,723 --> 00:41:04,523
no.

894
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:07,812
Well, I can't offer anything
as fancy as mario's. But..

895
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,833

But I'm told that...

898
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,155
- they look pretty
not good Hat lighting.

899
00:41:17,195 --> 00:41:17,846
Really...

900
00:41:17,886 --> 00:41:19,442

- Shall we?

901
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:27,243
