1
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:03,972
Put that down. We're not here
to feed the birds.

2
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:06,279
That's just a cover
to throw your dad off.

3
00:00:06,376 --> 00:00:10,189
Well, if we're not here to feed the
birds, what are we here to do, grandpa?

4
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:14,142
We're here to girl watch,
everything they do is magical.

5
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:18,922
Mysterious, your grandmother was
a lifetime of surprises.

6
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:21,190
Now, what can you tell me about her?

7
00:00:24,348 --> 00:00:26,781
She's a surfer. She's goofy-footed.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,114
- Goofy?
- Left-handed, but with her feet.

9
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:30,999
No, stop. Stop that right now.

10
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:35,390
I don't want you to profile her,
or tell me who she actually is.

11
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:37,905
I want you to tell
me who you think she is.

12
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:40,425
What she likes. What she dreams about.

13
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:42,204
Use your imagination.

14
00:00:42,818 --> 00:00:47,392
Well, then her name
is Larsa Von Lykenhoffer.

15
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,010
German broad, good.

16
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:50,256
What else? What else?

17
00:00:50,312 --> 00:00:54,566
And she's a giraffe
wrangler and a test pilot.

18
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:56,684
And it's possible she's a manimal.

19
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,715
Shawn, I thought I told you to finish
the dishes before you feed the birds.

20
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:03,961
Dad, Shawn's got chores that
come before goofin' off at the beach.

21
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,324
Let me relax with my grandson.

22
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:08,162
What are you two doing exactly?

23
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:10,050
Just beach gazing.

24
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:12,463
- You wouldn't understand.
- I understand.

25
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:14,356
- You wanna beach gaze?
- Scoot over.

26
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:18,261
You wanna beach gaze.
We'll all beach gaze.

27
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,777
Close your eyes, Shawn.

28
00:01:20,195 --> 00:01:23,795
- How many towels with red stripes?
- Here we go with the towel thing again.

29
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:25,172
Four.

30
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,359
Henry, do you have to drain
the fun out of everything?

31
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,707
Dad, I want you to leave the
raising of my son to me. All right?

32
00:01:32,262 --> 00:01:33,857
He's got responsibilities.

33
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:36,465
And you, you,
better be two steps behind me.

34
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:39,565
'cause you got a date
with some suds and a sponge.

35
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:43,752
Do me a favor, Shawn.

36
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:48,462
Sometimes you gotta let what
your dad says float through the ears.

37
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,944
Make your own choices.

38
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:53,600
Don't take life too seriously.

39
00:01:53,893 --> 00:01:55,191
Travel the world.

40
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:58,509
Meet interesting people.
Have some adventures.

41
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:01,650
Because some day you're gonna
wake up and realize

42
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,860
you're too old to
do anything really fun.

43
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:05,728
Yes, grandpa.

44
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,037
- This isn't gonna work, Shawn.
- It's gonna work.

45
00:02:08,064 --> 00:02:09,854
We've failed to get in here six times.

46
00:02:09,874 --> 00:02:11,100
We haven't gotten to one witness.

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,162
We haven't seen where the
missing man disappeared from.

48
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:14,689
This place is a fortress.

49
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,923
I think you might be right.
Maybe we should crawl.

50
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:20,879
I'm not crawling on this wet grass.

51
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:24,157
Dude.

52
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:28,269
I read an article that says
90% of high-voltage signs are bogus.

53
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,507
They just hang them up
there to scare people off.

54
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:32,495
Good theory. You test it.

55
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:33,706
I can't touch that.

56
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:36,440
I conduct way more electricity than you.
You know that.

57
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:38,353
Touch it. Just use your fingertip.

58
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,936
I'm not touching an
electrified fence, Shawn.

59
00:02:42,253 --> 00:02:43,840
How about I touch it?

60
00:02:44,558 --> 00:02:46,368
I don't think I like
the way that sounds.

61
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:56,108
What the hell are you
two doing with my stuff?

62
00:02:56,548 --> 00:02:58,480
- We need tools.
- For what?

63
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:04,320
If you must ask,
it's for a stakeout, okay.

64
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,824
We've got a tough case,
and our binoculars only go up to 2x.

65
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:08,322
Well, what are you doing with my cooler?

66
00:03:08,342 --> 00:03:10,029
We have to keep the
gelato cold in the car.

67
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:12,019
You two girls are useless...
Shawn, didn't you learn anything

68
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:15,568
- I ever taught you about surveillance?
- We happen to be awesome at covert ops.

69
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:18,377
We just ran into a bit of a gauntlet,
and took a missing person case

70
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:20,874
based in an extremely
difficult place to crack.

71
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:25,389
What impenetrable stronghold
did this missing person disappear from?

72
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:30,550
Glorious pines.

73
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:33,564
- Say again.
- Glorious

74
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:36,494
- pines.
- The old age home?

75
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:40,519
It's a retirement community.
It's top-of-the-line in independent

76
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:43,108
senior living, with a
full-time security team.

77
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:47,840
My son, the super sleuth, can't even get
himself access into an old folks home.

78
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:49,693
No-no-no-no, dad. You have
no idea what we're up against.

79
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:51,112
Okay. I tried everything.

80
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:53,313
I tried the whole,
"I'm a traveling doula" bit.

81
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,813
"The dingo ate my baby" routine.

82
00:03:55,898 --> 00:03:58,286
Hiding Gus in a sack trick,
which never fails.

83
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:00,553
Trust me. You wouldn't have gotten
any closer than we did.

84
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,697
Give me a break.

85
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:04,631
I'll be in that joint,
crack the case in eight minutes.

86
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:09,469
Okay, yeah.

87
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:11,446
Tomorrow. It's on.
Show us how it's done.

88
00:04:11,558 --> 00:04:12,845
No, wait, just hold on a second.

89
00:04:12,865 --> 00:04:14,413
- I didn't mean to...
- Exactly.

90
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,911
6:00 a. M. Sharp.

91
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:21,578
- That's too early.
- How about 9:00?

92
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:24,108
- 9:00's a little late.
- Come on, guys. Let's be reasonable.

93
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:26,323
Just split the difference. Okay?
Call it 11:15.

94
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:27,519
6:00 it is.

95
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:29,081
I'll drive.

96
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,739
You sure you wanna park this close, dad?

97
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,309
We're almost a quarter of a mile away.

98
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:38,056
Shawn, we're exactly where we should
be to get a read on the situation.

99
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:40,370
I can literally see the
curvature of the earth from here.

100
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,824
You know, Shawn, why don't you honk the horn and
let them know that we're here while you're at it?

101
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:46,544
Who is this missing guy?

102
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,403
Oswald Chester, resident, 73 years old.
He's been missing for three days.

103
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:56,087
And what we've gathered from our client is,
the community is trying to cover it up.

104
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:57,773
Your client went to the police already?

105
00:04:57,793 --> 00:04:59,296
I don't know, dad.
We didn't get that far.

106
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,184
What? You didn't ask the question?
What are you doing, Shawn

107
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:02,702
didn't you learn
anything that I tried to...

108
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:06,078
- All right, that's enough of this nonsense.
- No, not enough. We've just started.

109
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:11,625
Slow down, would you?

110
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,062
What are you gonna do,
march right in there?

111
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:14,569
That looks to be the plan.

112
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:16,851
No wonder you guys are failing so badly.

113
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:18,864
Rule number one, never make
yourself known to your target.

114
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,661
- Rule number two...
- Dad, you got your glasses?

115
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:23,094
- Yeah, of course I got my glasses.
- Good. Go ahead and put 'em on.

116
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:24,652
- What?
- Here. Give me that.

117
00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:26,578
Oh, a disguise. Look at you go.

118
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:28,594
Right out of the private
eye handbook, huh?

119
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,702
Here.

120
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:30,992
Put this on too.

121
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:33,226
This thing's like 100 years old.

122
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:36,875
What... Shawn... I look
like Henry Fonda.

123
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,443
Allow me to apologize
in advance for this.

124
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:41,312
Ah... hot.

125
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:43,913
- What the hell, Shawn?
- What the hell?

126
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,586
- Hold this for a second.
- What?

127
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,598
- May I help you?
- Yes. Pamela, is it?

128
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:52,488
That's what it says right in
front of you. May I help you?

129
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:55,080
- We are here to check somebody in.
- Really?

130
00:05:55,203 --> 00:05:56,622
And who might that be?

131
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:59,380
My grandfather.

132
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:10,994

- Transcript By:  www.swsub.com

135
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:30,137
- I'm not doing this. No, Shawn.
- Grampy.

136
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,001
Calm blue ocean.

137
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:33,344
Calm blue ocean.

138
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,694
- Go to your quiet place.
- I'm sorry.

139
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:37,400
But we don't accept walk-in admissions.

140
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,648
There's an application
and a very long waiting list.

141
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:42,003
- Uh, fine. We're leaving.
- No-no-no. Absolutely.

142
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:45,010
- He just got in off the waiting list.
- I'm not on any damn waiting list.

143
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,386
Please forgive our grampy here.

144
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,596
He gets irate and a little forgetful.

145
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,334
You two are brothers?

146
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:54,821
Our father worked at Benetton.

147
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:57,666
And what's your grandfather's name?

148
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:01,395
Talmadge McGulager.

149
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,621
Just a moment.

150
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:07,754
Talmadge McGulager?

151
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:08,864
Brilliant.

152
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,471
All right, look, what the hell
are you guys doing here?

153
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:13,656
This is the part where
you get blindsided with plan b.

154
00:07:13,676 --> 00:07:15,215
It's kinda fun when
it's not happening to me.

155
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,477
Look, I'm getting us in. Relax, dad.

156
00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:19,630
I mean, grandpappy.

157
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,035
This is never gonna work.

158
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:25,501
Mr. McGulager...
looks like we're all set.

159
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,208
What?

160
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,199
You're who I've been waiting for.

161
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:32,522
My apologies. I'm pamela,
the chief administrator.

162
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,884
My goodness, you don't look
remotely old enough to live here.

163
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,581
Grandpapa is 72.

164
00:07:39,936 --> 00:07:40,936
It's true.

165
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:42,734
The thing is,
he used to be a male model.

166
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,853
That's why he looks so young... You can
see he had a lot of plastic surgery done.

167
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:47,701
72?

168
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,882
My, my, they have done marvelous work.

169
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:54,813
I would have guessed 59, 60 tops.

170
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,039
All right, you listen here,
lady, I'm not a day over...

171
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,196
Opa! You be sweet to pamela.
She's here to help us.

172
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:01,651
She is a helper.

173
00:08:02,587 --> 00:08:03,772
Sorry, pamela.

174
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:06,519
He's gone a little...
How can I put this eloquently?

175
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,723
I understand.

176
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:12,466
A lot of our residents
are hesitant at first.

177
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:14,887
Excuse me while I get some forms.

178
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,049
All right, how did you
know about this talmadge?

179
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,014
Dad, use the cane.
It really helps sell it.

180
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:25,126
Wait, wait, wait. You had
this planned all along?

181
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:27,968
I snatched this off one
of the guards that tossed us.

182
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:32,543
According to the schedule, Talmadge McGulager
was supposed to check in last night.

183
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:35,941
So I called Mr. McGulager
and informed him that the community

184
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:38,650
is infested with
african gambian pouch rats.

185
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,085
The largest rats in the world. Nice.

186
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,639
He'll be back in three days.
It's the amount of time it takes

187
00:08:43,676 --> 00:08:46,320
to fly in and deploy
the pouch rat's natural predator.

188
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,154
The sudanese birch pelican.

189
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:51,106
You don't actually expect
me to spend three days here.

190
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,068
No-no-no. We're gonna solve it in two.

191
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:56,028
The third day is really
more about reflection.

192
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:59,425
Besides, with you in here, we'll be able to
get visitor's passes, come and go as we please.

193
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:01,358
All right, all right,
I'll tell you what, Shawn.

194
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:04,002
Normally I'd storm outta here.
I'd leave you in the lurch.

195
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:07,348
But this time, kid, just this time,
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

196
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:09,794
I'll be your talmadge magruder.

197
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:11,370
- McGregor.
- McGulager.

198
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,066
- Exactly.
- I'll be all those guys.

199
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:15,058
And I'll have this case solved by lunch.

200
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,278
Considering they eat lunch here at 10:15,
I'm gonna say we'll have it done by 9:45.

201
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:22,125
- You're on.
- You're on.

202
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:25,853
Mr. McGulager, why don't
I show you around the facilities.

203
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:28,543
And your grandboys fill
out your admissions paperwork?

204
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,196
That's a brilliant idea, boys.
Why don't you get right on that?

205
00:09:31,265 --> 00:09:34,076
Can we fill that out later? We'd really
like to take a look around as well.

206
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:36,366
Yeah, and I have a bit
of carpal tunnel going on.

207
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:37,862
We'll just tag along if that's okay.

208
00:09:37,882 --> 00:09:41,482
You don't take one step past this point
until all of these forms are complete.

209
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:43,417
There are two signatures
which must be in blue.

210
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:45,475
I'll let you figure
out which ones those are.

211
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:47,848
Lester here will check
your work when you're done.

212
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:54,916
- You wanted to see us, chief?
- What's your caseload like?

213
00:09:54,972 --> 00:09:56,101
- Light.
- ...ish.

214
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,205
Good answer.

215
00:09:57,252 --> 00:10:00,139
Because I have a special assignment
that comes directly from the mayor.

216
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,865
The mayor? Really?

217
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:02,896
Yes.

218
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,602
There's your assignment.

219
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:13,837
- Is he a witness or something?
- No, he's just a delinquent.

220
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,364
He's been pulling off
some penny ante vandal stuff.

221
00:10:16,384 --> 00:10:19,174
Taking down street signs, crazy
gluing parking meter slots,

222
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:21,852
removing hood ornaments.
Nothing serious yet, but...

223
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:25,175
Ah, but that's how it starts. One minute
they're destroying public property

224
00:10:25,203 --> 00:10:26,972
and the next thing you
know they're shooting cops.

225
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:29,843
- So what I need you to do is...
- No, I know exactly

226
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,149
where you were going with this thing, chief. It's
like our brains are just connected on this thing.

227
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:36,423
I'm just trying to figure
out how we try this kid as an adult.

228
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:45,278
I need you to dial it back about 50 notches,
or I will ask you to put your gun on my desk.

229
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:48,489
What you are going to
do is straighten him out.

230
00:10:48,573 --> 00:10:52,399
Spend a little time with him.
Take him on a ride-a-long. Nurture him.

231
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,554
Show him what a life of crime leads to.

232
00:10:54,574 --> 00:10:56,576
And he gets this special
treatment because?

233
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:59,414
His mother's the deputy mayor, and
she doesn't want the kid in the system.

234
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:00,691
So just fix him.

235
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:05,590
Yes, ma'am.

236
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,156
I think all that writing
gave me a ganglion cyst.

237
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:10,464
You can't get a cyst
from filling out paperwork.

238
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:11,962
If the pen is wrong, you can.

239
00:11:11,982 --> 00:11:13,896
There's definitely some
carpal bossing in there.

240
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,143
We should see if they have some
extra thumb splints lying around.

241
00:11:16,163 --> 00:11:17,363
You know what we should do?

242
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:19,444
We should enroll
you in some man classes.

243
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:21,727
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.

244
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,001
While you two guys were
off dottin' your I's and

245
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,001
crossing your t's, I was
busy cracking your case.

246
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:29,137
It worked. You're finally in.

247
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:31,220
- Who the hell is he?
- He's our client.

248
00:11:31,326 --> 00:11:34,800
You have a guy on the inside, and
you need me to get you in here, come on!

249
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,296
I didn't get all the clearances
I was hoping for, okay?

250
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:38,770
Jervis works here part-time.

251
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,355
He doesn't exactly get
the respect he deserves.

252
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,366
Hey!

253
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:45,692
How the hell'd you two get in here?

254
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,747
- You're coming with me.
- I don't think so.

255
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,791
Bam!

256
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:53,381
Say it with me, o/~ vis-it-or's badge
o/~ o/~ uh-huh, uh-huh o/~ do something.

257
00:11:53,407 --> 00:11:54,407
I dare you.

258
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:57,009
I'll be watching you.

259
00:11:57,164 --> 00:11:58,882
We'll be gettin' watched.

260
00:12:03,142 --> 00:12:05,613
We gotta hurry. I'm not supposed
to be off lawn duty.

261
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:08,576
- I'll show you where you're sleeping.
- I'm not sleepin' anywhere.

262
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:14,630
I at least got them to give talmadge
the other empty bed in Oswald's room.

263
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:16,473
Yeah, you practically own the joint.

264
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:19,647
Jervis, give him the scoop,
so he'll shut up for a minute.

265
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:24,053
Oswald disappeared from this
room three mornings ago without a trace.

266
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:27,217
I'm gonna ask the first question
that my son should have asked.

267
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:29,800
- Have you tried the police?
- The police?

268
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:33,448
The police couldn't catch
bird flu at a hong kong duck farm.

269
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,201
They blew me off just
like the staff here did.

270
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:38,418
Anything else you wanna tell us,
Mr. Kent?

271
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:41,102
- No, not that I can think of.
- Are you sure?

272
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:43,094
Dad, what are you getting at?
Just spit it out.

273
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,168
Shawn, Oswald Chester disappeared
from these grounds 12 times before.

274
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:47,983
And the last three instances
they threatened to throw

275
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:49,993
his ass outta here if
he ever did it again.

276
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:52,177
Don't you check these nutcases
out before you take 'em on?

277
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:53,377
Is that true, Jervis?

278
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:54,824
Uh, yes.

279
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:57,294
Did you also happen to mention
to my son that during these jaunts,

280
00:12:57,314 --> 00:12:59,979
the community here filled
out a missing persons report.

281
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:02,516
Only to have good old
ozzie pop up the next day.

282
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:04,223
Guys, I know what this sounds like.

283
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:07,434
But ozzie did not run off on his own.
Not this time.

284
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:08,887
And you know this how?

285
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:10,473
He was my best friend.

286
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:15,329
I could always tell when he was
getting antsy, when he wanted to run.

287
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:18,860
But this time there were no warning
signs. He just vanished into thin air.

288
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:22,036
Jervis, life lesson
number 20: people lie.

289
00:13:22,162 --> 00:13:24,074
Then they leave without warning.

290
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:25,827
Life sucks.

291
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,226
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

292
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,550
I'm getting something.

293
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,122
It's strong.

294
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,311
Leathery.

295
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:36,802
Could be alligator.
He left without his wallet.

296
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,230
He doesn't have his wallet.

297
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,919
That's amazing.

298
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:42,569
Can't get very far without cash.
Can you, pop?

299
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:45,527
Yeah, and all his cash and
credit cards are still in his wallet.

300
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,646
- You went through his wallet?
- Of course I did.

301
00:13:47,672 --> 00:13:49,729
I'm investigating this thing too,
you know.

302
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:53,215
I have a theory based on
formaldehyde and mind control.

303
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,538
Jervis, do you mind if I confer
with my two grandsons here

304
00:13:56,558 --> 00:13:58,448
for a moment while
we work through all this?

305
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:00,530
But you haven't heard my
identical twins theory.

306
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,191
First thing tomorrow morning.
All right, Shawn,come on. Let's go.

307
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:05,416
There is no case here.
This guy is just awol.

308
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:06,881
Hey, look at this.

309
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:09,367
Oswald was on prazosin
for high blood pressure.

310
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:12,362
Why would he possibly leave
without his partalecsdnt...

311
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:14,846
You can fill that
prescription anywhere, Shawn.

312
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:30,518
- He went running.
- What?

313
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,395
He was traing for a marathon.

314
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:37,010
Those numbers are the distances
he was trying to reach.

315
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,694
And the date that's circled
is the santa barbara marathon.

316
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:41,156
And how do you know that?

317
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:43,794
Easy, it's the same
as val kilmer's birthday.

318
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,619
We gotta figure out
where he went jogging.

319
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,110
All right, Shawn, I'm gonna humor ya.

320
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,293
Let's get outta here.

321
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:52,745
Humor me?

322
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:54,428
That was spot on.

323
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,834
It's like almond butter with honey.

324
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:58,649
You only know that because
you have an unhealthy

325
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,659
fascination with
the guy fromreal genius.

326
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,567
Okay, that's it.
You're not coming with us.

327
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:04,473
I am going down to that
Nazi lady at the front desk,

328
00:15:04,493 --> 00:15:06,652
and I am having your
in/out privileges revoked.

329
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,934
Oh, Mr. McGulager.

330
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:09,497
This is Meredith Cloverfield.

331
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:11,775
Hi, I'm in charge of room service here.

332
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,014
She's gonna check on
your special dietary needs.

333
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:15,698
Now, do you have any digestive issues?

334
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:18,997
- No, no, not...
- Don't let him lie to you, Miss Cloverfield.

335
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:22,978
He has a very weak heart. All he can
have is egg whites and powdered dirt.

336
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:25,715
And he shouldn't have
any solid foods after noon.

337
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:28,739
- Is that true?
- No, no. My son is a liar.

338
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:31,632
- Your son?
- No, no. I, uh, my grandson too.

339
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:33,868
Both liars. Big filthy liars.

340
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,824
So how are we gonna blindly
trace a man's jogging path?

341
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:38,609
We're gonna use my indian blood.

342
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:41,032
You can't get indian
blood by working in a casino.

343
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:42,599
Maybe you can't.

344
00:15:44,538 --> 00:15:47,876
Dude, this place goes nowhere.
If I was gonna run, I'd go that way.

345
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:56,413
Now where do we go?

346
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:00,953
I sense he'd go this way.

347
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:03,509
That's amazing, Shawn.

348
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:09,561
Man, this guy was in good shape.

349
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:11,426
Would you stop it?

350
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:13,115
He was, like, 100.

351
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:15,290
Maybe if you weren't
wearing plowman's boots.

352
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,353
I'm not wearing plowman's boots, Shawn!

353
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:28,121
All right,
looks like we got two options.

354
00:16:29,732 --> 00:16:31,328
I say we go this way.

355
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:34,617
Hold up, let's think
this through for a minute.

356
00:16:45,983 --> 00:16:47,563
What are you doing?

357
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:53,482
I'd go uphill first, save the
downhill part for the home stretch.

358
00:16:53,502 --> 00:16:55,853
Plus this side gets better
shade in the afternoon.

359
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:57,848
I'm also sensing some
water buffalo nearby.

360
00:16:57,868 --> 00:16:59,588
What is that? Your indian blood?

361
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:02,321
They were here first, Gus.
Don't ever forget that.

362
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:05,292
- Always hatin' on the indians.
- It's not the indians, Shawn.

363
00:17:05,312 --> 00:17:06,747
I'm hatin' on you.

364
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:19,134
Dude, that rock is
sprayed with arterial red.

365
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:23,098
- Maybe it's roadkill.
- Taste it.

366
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:26,103
- What is that about?
- What?

367
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:28,298
My whole life you've been
trying to get me taste blood.

368
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,166
Every time I cut myself or
scrape myself, it was,

369
00:17:31,186 --> 00:17:34,725
Shawn, taste it, lick it.
"It'll make you feel better."

370
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:36,421
It does. Lick it.

371
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:38,846
- It's not my blood.
- It's on a rock.

372
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,295
Dude. Pedometer.

373
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,890
It's exactly what a marathon runner
would be carrying around with him.

374
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,137
How far would you say
we are from the community?

375
00:17:52,157 --> 00:17:53,790
I would say about six miles.

376
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:59,335
- I guess we found the place where he fell.
- Yeah, we did.

377
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,585
Now we got a bigger problem.

378
00:18:01,818 --> 00:18:05,818
If he's not at the community, and he's
not here, where the hell is his body?

379
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:19,693
This is the closest hospital
to the drop zone.

380
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:23,072
If someone came across Oswald's body,
this is where he would be.

381
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:24,937
Hi there.

382
00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:27,263
We're looking for my father,
Oswald Chester.

383
00:18:28,877 --> 00:18:31,508
I'm sorry,
we don't have anyone here by that name.

384
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,295
You know what? He left
his I. D. At home.

385
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:41,931
Can you check for a John Doe, please?

386
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:44,216
Actually, can you check all the Doe's?

387
00:18:44,236 --> 00:18:47,536
Tae-kwon, cookie, play, do-si?

388
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,701
I'm sorry. Visiting hours just ended.

389
00:18:53,711 --> 00:18:56,553
Looks like we're gonna
have to go... Shawn... Incognito.

390
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:09,208
Candy striper? Really?

391
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:11,111
I didn't even know they
made those uniforms for men.

392
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:13,017
They just started. There was a lawsuit.

393
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:15,150
I'm just saying, aim higher.

394
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:20,661
I hope you understand what
a huge break you're getting here.

395
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:22,541
This back seat smells like foot.

396
00:19:22,604 --> 00:19:24,903
I mean, seriously,
did something die back here?

397
00:19:24,923 --> 00:19:28,650
That's the smell of your future
unless you straighten up and fly right.

398
00:19:28,718 --> 00:19:30,408
What's your story, baby?

399
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:32,903
- Excuse me?
- It's detective O'Hara, punk.

400
00:19:33,024 --> 00:19:35,965
- And that's strike one.
- Is he always like this?

401
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,443
Call me baby again,
you're gonna get on my bad side too.

402
00:19:38,463 --> 00:19:42,465
Whoa, what bad side?
All good from where I'm sitting.

403
00:19:42,572 --> 00:19:44,409
Hey, unless you wanna pee in front of
seven other guys

404
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:46,673
for the rest of your life,
you will respect the badge.

405
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:49,162
- Why don't you tell me why you're acting out?
- I'm not acting out!

406
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:51,421
- He started it!
- I was talking to the kid.

407
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:55,887
Did anyone tell you that
your hair smells like strawberries?

408
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:57,139
It's peaches.

409
00:19:59,234 --> 00:20:01,804
I have to buy peaches on the way home.
I just remembered.

410
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:05,069
- So, uh, juliet...
- It's detective O'Hara!

411
00:20:05,098 --> 00:20:07,805
- Strike two.
- You gotta lighten up, man.

412
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:10,954
You get to hang out with this
amazingly hot woman all day long.

413
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:13,122
Detective O'Hara's
an officer of the law.

414
00:20:13,148 --> 00:20:15,668
She is a competent investigator,
efficient with her paperwork,

415
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:18,262
and maintains her work space
in a clean and orderly fashion.

416
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:20,710
But she is above all things, not hot!

417
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,852
Wheelchair to admitting.

418
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:33,089
Wheelchair to admitting.

419
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:39,110
That's Oswald!

420
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:42,139
Let's find out what happened.
Medical students?

421
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:44,330
- Residents.
- It's all the same to me.

422
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,329
Hello. I am Dr. Hauser.

423
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:48,955
I am filling in today.

424
00:20:48,975 --> 00:20:51,281
This is my personal
candy striper knik-knac.

425
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:53,101
- Hello.
- He's from guam.

426
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:54,836
We will be instructing you.

427
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,003
Let's begin. You, impress me.

428
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:59,669
This patient is three days post-op.

429
00:21:01,196 --> 00:21:03,617
He has an open wound,
which is healing nicely.

430
00:21:06,046 --> 00:21:08,628
Knic-knac, get a hold of yourself.

431
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,638
Or I'll put you on the
first raft back to talofo.

432
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:16,128
God, that looks like roadkill.

433
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:21,781
Yeah, is what his family probably
thought when they came here to visit.

434
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:23,457
Because they love him.

435
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:25,000
You know what? I was...

436
00:21:25,037 --> 00:21:27,206
I was thinking of
something more in an older guy.

437
00:21:27,674 --> 00:21:30,830
Athletic build. Perhaps in a
coma or a coma-like state.

438
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:32,866
The patient behind you's in a coma.

439
00:21:32,898 --> 00:21:34,112
No sh...

440
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:38,825
Perfect. Let's begin there.

441
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:41,183
John Doe.

442
00:21:41,203 --> 00:21:45,088
Admitted two days ago with severe
hypotension causing low brain perfusion.

443
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:49,205
Also suffered intracranial
bleed from syncope and falling down.

444
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:55,724
What the hell's wrong with you?

445
00:21:55,744 --> 00:21:58,843
Where do you get off using all those long,
complicated words in front of the patient?

446
00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:02,992
You know, when I went to school where
one goes to become a doctor...

447
00:22:03,012 --> 00:22:03,794
- Med school.
- Yes,

448
00:22:03,814 --> 00:22:06,801
there was something called
bedside manner.

449
00:22:06,904 --> 00:22:08,535
Do they not teach that anymore?

450
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,766
Uh, sir, this patient's unconscious.
He can't hear me.

451
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:12,834
You're wrong.

452
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,397
You're dead wrong. He can hear you.

453
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:19,504
Sure, his body is sleeping,
but inside he is dancing.

454
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,706
- He is feeling it.
- He's doing his thing.

455
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:25,834
And he hears you say all those scary words,
and he retreats right back into his mind.

456
00:22:25,854 --> 00:22:27,858
Now, do you wanna
help this patient or not?

457
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:29,359
Of course, sir.

458
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,370
Then speak to me like I'm ten years old.

459
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:36,970
He had a sudden drop in blood pressure,
which deprived his brain of blood.

460
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,679
He also suffered a contusion
and small cerebral hemorrhage.

461
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:43,577
Talk to me like I'm five.

462
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:50,519
His blood pressure went boom?

463
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,475
- And his brain got an owie.
- I see.

464
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:57,558
- And why do we suspect foul play?
- We don't suspect foul play.

465
00:22:57,615 --> 00:23:01,806
Oh, really? You don't find anything at
all strange about his condition?

466
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:05,049
Well, his b. P. didn't come up immediately
when we administered fluids.

467
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:07,168
- And what does that tell us?
- He...

468
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:10,230
probably took too much of his
blood pressure medication by accident.

469
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,265
Sometimes the elderly have to take
a lot of pills at different dosages,

470
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:15,739
or they take it,
forget, and take it again.

471
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,703
But there's nothing criminal about that.

472
00:23:17,723 --> 00:23:19,751
No. No, there's not.

473
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:24,252
Well done. Both of you.

474
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,758
I don't know about you, but I'm drained.
What do you say we take a fiver?

475
00:23:26,836 --> 00:23:28,453
Grab a coke. Maybe play some frogger.

476
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:30,696
Doctor, we still have
a lot of patients to see.

477
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:32,653
Five minutes isn't
gonna kill them, is it?

478
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:38,077
- Is it?
- We did it, Gus.

479
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:42,066
We beat my dad. Proved our point.
Now let's rub it in a little.

480
00:23:42,177 --> 00:23:44,807
Maybe make fun of his toes.
Give Jervis the good news.

481
00:23:44,865 --> 00:23:46,792
- Get the hell out of here.
- I hear that.

482
00:23:46,812 --> 00:23:48,416
I'm starved.

483
00:23:57,212 --> 00:24:00,102
That's four in a row, talmadge.
You're on fire!

484
00:24:00,209 --> 00:24:02,035
You just broke the pines record.

485
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,200
For what?

486
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,897
Number of times jumping
in without breaking a hip?

487
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:08,951
Yeah, that's funny, kid.
Hey, Talmy, who is this?

488
00:24:09,006 --> 00:24:12,839
Oh, this is my S...
grandson Shawn and his...

489
00:24:13,893 --> 00:24:16,792
Hey, guys, meet buddy Markowitz.
He used to be a stand-up in the catskills.

490
00:24:16,812 --> 00:24:21,000
And Rodrigo Lopez,
one-time number five, clearly no longer,

491
00:24:21,047 --> 00:24:22,822
Lightweight champion of the world.

492
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:26,062
Ah, and that's my asian
friend Hoo Flung Poo.

493
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:31,232
- I don't get it.
- That guy wasn't even asian.

494
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:33,019
Well, that's what makes it funny.

495
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:39,074
You mind if we steal
g-pop here for a second?

496
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:42,130
Just as long as he's back
in time for the cannonball competition!

497
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,640
Oh, yeah!

498
00:24:47,678 --> 00:24:48,932
Oh, thank you.

499
00:24:48,952 --> 00:24:50,739
What are you wearing?

500
00:24:50,778 --> 00:24:53,482
Well, you didn't pack me any trunks, Shawn.
This is the only thing I could borrow.

501
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:55,983
Yeah, well, while you've
been here playing at campcoon,

502
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:57,662
We've been Busy solving the case.

503
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,603
We found Oswal, he was in the hospital.

504
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,087
Time to get you outta here.

505
00:25:01,158 --> 00:25:02,158
No, no, no, no.

506
00:25:02,186 --> 00:25:03,437
We can't leave yet.

507
00:25:03,766 --> 00:25:05,651
Why not?
This case isn't over.

508
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:08,158
Look, this place is a hot
bed of suspicious activity.

509
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:09,081
Hey there.

510
00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:10,526
Here's your sandwich, talmadge.

511
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:11,986
Well, thank you, Meredith.

512
00:25:12,006 --> 00:25:16,108
Thank you, where's that barbecue sauce?

513
00:25:16,128 --> 00:25:19,087
You know Pamela really
doesn't like complainers here.

514
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:21,476
You know you Lucky.
You should see the food give my mother

515
00:25:21,496 --> 00:25:23,532
over at that horrible sunshine
Meadows place.

516
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:26,089
It is one step above cat food.

517
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,298
Gee, mer, I'd feel a whole lot luckier

518
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:32,955
if the sweetest woman in the world
would score me just a little Teensy,

519
00:25:32,975 --> 00:25:35,575
Eensy, Weensy bit of steak sauce.
Come on.

520
00:25:35,595 --> 00:25:38,467
- Your grandfather is a flirt.
- You are, ah!

521
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,734
That is disgusting.

522
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:43,769
You like it here.

523
00:25:44,017 --> 00:25:45,304
You, you do. That.

524
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:47,680
That's why you wanna keep investigating.

525
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,695
Because you like the sandwiches
and the adulation.

526
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,512
Shawn, I'm telling you.
Something else is going on here.

527
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:54,980
Dad, we found oswald.

528
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,680
There's nothing left to solve.
Admit it.

529
00:25:56,882 --> 00:26:00,584
We beat you because
we have the sweetness.

530
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:03,695
All right, clear a path, folks.
Coming through.

531
00:26:03,758 --> 00:26:04,762
It's all right.

532
00:26:04,782 --> 00:26:07,276
You have the sweetness?
What about that guy, Shawn?

533
00:26:12,524 --> 00:26:13,682
What about that one?

534
00:26:17,946 --> 00:26:19,280
They're dropping like flies.

535
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:26,223
- You saw the bracelets, didn't you?
- Yes, I saw them.

536
00:26:26,262 --> 00:26:28,775
All right, so we got three
guys all living at the same place.

537
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:32,120
They all get sick, and for some reason
they're all wearing the Same bracelets.

538
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,394
What were you saying again,
Shawn, about solving this case?

539
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:43,875
Soemone is treint of old timers,

540
00:26:43,952 --> 00:26:45,719
at glorious pines.

541
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:47,851
Three people have gotten
suddenly sick there.

542
00:26:47,871 --> 00:26:49,703
It could be an angel
of death type thing.

543
00:26:49,802 --> 00:26:51,669
You know, that is a brilliant theory.

544
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:53,799
But
what you've failed to take into account

545
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:56,721
is that it's five degrees hotter today
than the same day last year.

546
00:26:57,748 --> 00:26:59,629
Frogs can't swallow
with their eyes open.

547
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,519
It's true.

548
00:27:02,184 --> 00:27:05,227
I'm sorry, I thought we were offering
up useless pieces of information.

549
00:27:05,247 --> 00:27:09,138
What lassiter here means is that it's
not out of the ordinary for older people

550
00:27:09,158 --> 00:27:11,471
to fall ill during
heat waves or cold snaps.

551
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:14,349
Look, we found oswald
when you were convinced

552
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:16,397
he was just wandering around
in his bathrobe.

553
00:27:16,713 --> 00:27:18,713
This is our client, Jervis Kent.

554
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:21,429
I mean, shouldn't you call forensics in?

555
00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:25,299
Look at wills. Interview beneficiaries.
I learned that at the police academy.

556
00:27:25,886 --> 00:27:27,367
You went to the academy?

557
00:27:27,387 --> 00:27:29,122
I thought I recognized that name.

558
00:27:29,158 --> 00:27:31,049
Aren't you the guy
who set his black and white

559
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:32,641
on fire during the academy road test?

560
00:27:32,661 --> 00:27:36,177
Yeah, you shot someone's
toe off at the police firing range.

561
00:27:36,556 --> 00:27:38,223
It didn't come all the way off.

562
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:39,616
I saw him yesterday.

563
00:27:39,636 --> 00:27:41,251
- He still has a limp.
- Spool!

564
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:44,667
Threads, thread.

565
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:45,747
I'm seeing thread.

566
00:27:46,685 --> 00:27:49,615
Spinning, and, and,
bobbing and weaving.

567
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:52,520
Arting, yet
crafting.

568
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,699
Bracelets.

569
00:27:57,674 --> 00:27:58,924
Homemade bracelets.

570
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:01,213
All three of them had the same bracelet.

571
00:28:01,297 --> 00:28:04,714
Well, in that case, O'hara, call CNN
because we've got their new lead story.

572
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:08,374
Do the doctors who've been treating
any of these patients suspect foul play?

573
00:28:08,648 --> 00:28:09,658
No, Chief.

574
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:10,965
Well,

575
00:28:11,624 --> 00:28:12,799
double-check.

576
00:28:13,465 --> 00:28:15,948
Mr. Spencer,
as always it's been an experience.

577
00:28:15,968 --> 00:28:17,288
You know where the exit is.

578
00:28:17,477 --> 00:28:18,713
I gotta finesse that...

579
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:21,654
do you see what happens when
you act like a Jackass all the time?

580
00:28:21,674 --> 00:28:22,949
No one takes you seriously.

581
00:28:22,973 --> 00:28:25,071
If you do not wanna end up like
that buffoon,

582
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:27,571
you better learn to walk
the straight and narrow.

583
00:28:27,795 --> 00:28:29,286
I don't like that guy.

584
00:28:29,728 --> 00:28:31,324
There's hope for you yet, kid.

585
00:28:35,871 --> 00:28:37,561
And what was all that bracelet talk?

586
00:28:37,581 --> 00:28:39,608
I sensed a common thread. Pun intended.

587
00:28:39,766 --> 00:28:42,336
You mean the friendship bracelets?
Those came from Chelsea.

588
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,540
She makes them herself in craft class.

589
00:28:44,763 --> 00:28:46,763
And she doesn't just
give 'em to anybody.

590
00:28:50,004 --> 00:28:52,267
Dude, she's totally dancing with my dad.

591
00:28:52,335 --> 00:28:53,762
Where did they learn the tango?

592
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:56,006
Grab a partner.
Meet me on the dance floor.

593
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:00,943
So you knew my friend oswald, right?

594
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:02,397
He courted me a little.

595
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,618
Can i, get cutsies?

596
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:06,053
Find your own partner, Shawn.

597
00:29:06,073 --> 00:29:07,671
I don't mind, Talmadge.

598
00:29:07,691 --> 00:29:11,496
I haven't had this many men ask
me to dance since Nixon went to China.

599
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:12,582
Hello.

600
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:13,867
My name is Shawn.

601
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,227
I'm Talmadge's Grandson.

602
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:17,410
I'm trying to meet
all of his new friends.

603
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,592
Did he happen to mention
that I'm a Psychic?

604
00:29:19,962 --> 00:29:21,163
Psychic.

605
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:22,353
Really?

606
00:29:25,648 --> 00:29:27,104
I sensed a dark cloud.

607
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:30,104
And then, did you hear
about what happened to Harley?

608
00:29:30,322 --> 00:29:32,382
The paramedics and all of that stuff?

609
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:33,768
Of course I heard.

610
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:35,611
He's an ex-boyfriend of mine.

611
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:40,366
You dance divinely, Burton.

612
00:29:40,452 --> 00:29:41,452
Thank you.

613
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:43,514
My turn, Shawn.

614
00:29:46,482 --> 00:29:49,100
So you're quite the
queen bee around here?

615
00:29:49,172 --> 00:29:51,951
You have many boyfriends
here at glorious pines?

616
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:53,798
I've had my share of romantic trysts.

617
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:57,422
Men fall in love easily
when I start taking care of them.

618
00:29:57,544 --> 00:29:58,544
What do you mean?

619
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:00,037
Now spin me.

620
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:04,066
Maaaarvelous.

621
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,481
They call it the Florence
nightingale effect.

622
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:08,629
So you're a nurse.

623
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:12,137
You must have done a lot of
work here with different medications.

624
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:13,907
Well, not anymore.

625
00:30:14,085 --> 00:30:17,968
All I do now is lead the heart-smart high
blood pressure seminar once a month.

626
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,297
That's where I met Harley and Oswald.

627
00:30:26,427 --> 00:30:27,761
Save me a seat at bingo.

628
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:32,683
Shawn.

629
00:30:33,113 --> 00:30:34,831
Shawn, come back here!

630
00:30:35,455 --> 00:30:37,596
We learned that all the
victims had high blood pressure,

631
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:39,280
so they might have been
on the same medications.

632
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,954
I learned that old people are heavy.

633
00:30:40,974 --> 00:30:42,567
Look, my prized students believe

634
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:45,116
that ozzie got sick
because he overdosed on his medication.

635
00:30:45,151 --> 00:30:46,300
Maybe they all did.

636
00:30:46,406 --> 00:30:48,635
Which means either three
different people all accidentally

637
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:51,094
- took too many pills
- or someone else slipped it to them.

638
00:30:51,128 --> 00:30:52,982
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

639
00:30:53,281 --> 00:30:55,367
I overheard a couple
of the guards talking about

640
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,710
a break-in at the on-site
pharmacy here last week.

641
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:58,552
Really?

642
00:30:58,572 --> 00:31:00,219
You wait until just now to tell us that?

643
00:31:00,518 --> 00:31:02,438
The thief got away
with codeine and oxycontin.

644
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:05,168
But I think they also got
away with blood pressure medication.

645
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:08,004
So that stuff was just a cover
to make it look like drug-seeker.

646
00:31:08,024 --> 00:31:09,497
The BP Meds were the real target.

647
00:31:09,897 --> 00:31:13,203
All right, at least that gives us the how.
Now we just gotta figure out the why.

648
00:31:13,223 --> 00:31:15,819
Which reminds me, gus, will you
please get us those tickets for the who?

649
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:16,519
Where?

650
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:21,899
Look, we need to get a list of all
the people on blood pressure medication.

651
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,369
- They're all targets.
- That's something Pamela would have.

652
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:30,414
We gotta get her outta there.

653
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:32,512
The real talmadge's stuff
showed up this morning.

654
00:31:32,532 --> 00:31:34,207
He's gonna be here today.

655
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,602
I bet she'll come out
if a resident hurt themselves.

656
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:38,605
Take a spill down the stairs.

657
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,774
- What?
- Just take a quick header down the stairs.

658
00:31:40,794 --> 00:31:44,344
I'm not gonna deliberately hurt myself,
break my neck to create a distraction.

659
00:31:44,364 --> 00:31:46,859
Fine. Push you. It'll be an
accident. Does that make it easier?

660
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:48,365
What? You have to do something.

661
00:31:50,736 --> 00:31:51,858
My toe!

662
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,873
Hey, I hurt my toe here.

663
00:31:53,893 --> 00:31:56,509
- You stubbed your toe?
- Dude, you have to do better than that.

664
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:59,288
- I'm your father. You do not call me dude.
- Pull your weight! Come on.

665
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:03,164
My liver! My liver! Oh, my liver!
It could be failing.

666
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:05,224
You go from one to ten like that?

667
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:07,051
How about a heart attack or a stroke?

668
00:32:08,441 --> 00:32:09,441
My liver.

669
00:32:14,177 --> 00:32:15,194
My liver!

670
00:32:16,298 --> 00:32:18,862
- Oh, god, it hurts.
- Your liver is fine.

671
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:20,250
You're not even jaundiced.

672
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:26,033
Abdominal pain can be
caused by a lot of things.

673
00:32:26,138 --> 00:32:28,393
You're not even holding your liver.
That's your spleen.

674
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:29,367
My spleen?

675
00:32:30,337 --> 00:32:32,038
It's my spleen!
It's about to rupture!

676
00:32:32,058 --> 00:32:34,684
Now, now, now, now, mr.
Mcgulager, settle down.

677
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:35,817
Oh, it's so painful!

678
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,236
We need to find a list
of people's medications.

679
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,808
I think this is it!

680
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:44,340
No, this is the waiting list.

681
00:32:44,904 --> 00:32:47,272
Dude, Oswald's getting kicked out.

682
00:32:47,587 --> 00:32:48,504
Tomorrow.

683
00:32:48,524 --> 00:32:50,009
It says FTC Next to his name.

684
00:32:50,253 --> 00:32:52,245
The other two victims as well. FTC.

685
00:32:52,265 --> 00:32:54,199
Ferocious tiger what?

686
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:56,226
FTC means full time care.

687
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:59,836
Looks like all the victims
need additional nursing assistance now.

688
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:01,357
What? They get kicked out for that?

689
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:04,361
This place won't accept anybody
that needs continuous medical care.

690
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:06,241
It was all in the
informational handbook.

691
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:07,638
That's what's happening here.

692
00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:10,367
Someone on the waiting
list got tired of waiting.

693
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:13,069
Recognize any of those names?

694
00:33:14,787 --> 00:33:16,348
We just found our bad guy!

695
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,136
What?

696
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:19,075
What?

697
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,028
What?

698
00:33:20,135 --> 00:33:20,977
What?

699
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,701
<i>Is someone in there?</i>

700
00:33:23,937 --> 00:33:25,571
- Take the window.
- <i>Who's in there?</i>

701
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:27,507
Lester! Lester, I need the key.

702
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:31,210
This is Darryl Jablonsky.

703
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:34,495
He's currently doing a nickel
at the state pen.

704
00:33:34,644 --> 00:33:36,004
- Darryl.
- Meet jj.

705
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:37,808
Call me "hell on earth."

706
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,734
We all thought jj would
benefit in meeting you, hell.

707
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:42,871
See, you two have a lot in common.

708
00:33:43,192 --> 00:33:45,595
Jj here is also a tough guy.

709
00:33:45,688 --> 00:33:47,109
He's not afraid of the law.

710
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:49,223
So what you in for?

711
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,620
Vandalism.

712
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:52,176
Repeated.

713
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:54,722
Vandalism.

714
00:33:56,796 --> 00:33:59,705
So why don't you take his rap
sheet back to chucke. Cheese, man,

715
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:02,012
because the only thing you're gonna
get in here

716
00:34:02,032 --> 00:34:04,600
is curbed for a Chicago smile and,

717
00:34:11,404 --> 00:34:12,503
I'm sorry.

718
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,539
I just can't do this now.

719
00:34:15,142 --> 00:34:17,659
Okay, I think he's got the message.
Prison is hell. Let's go.

720
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:18,837
Can't do what?

721
00:34:19,884 --> 00:34:21,496
I can't lie, Jj.

722
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:24,288
Part of my rehabilitation
according to Dr. Shenkman.

723
00:34:24,877 --> 00:34:27,236
I'm not supposed to be lying,
and things.

724
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:30,003
So tell me for real.

725
00:34:30,342 --> 00:34:31,605
What's it like in prison?

726
00:34:31,749 --> 00:34:32,740
For real?

727
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,110
It ain't bad.

728
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:38,593
I hang out with my best friend,
"White Slavery,"

729
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:39,604
most of the day.

730
00:34:39,816 --> 00:34:40,816
We go work out.

731
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,392
Chill in the library.

732
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:44,706
We got the correctionson CD.

733
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,387
It's read by Robert Forster.

734
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:48,917
It's pretty good. It's tight, man.
I enjoyed it.

735
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:51,570
Then we go back again.
We work out. We eat and sleep.

736
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:52,711
We chit chat.

737
00:34:52,832 --> 00:34:53,832
Play ball.

738
00:34:54,286 --> 00:34:56,502
You know what I mean?
We do what we do, man. It's,

739
00:34:56,522 --> 00:34:58,061
like, good living out here, man.

740
00:34:58,102 --> 00:35:00,247
Okay, but the guards are merciless.

741
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:01,784
Nah, man, they're pretty cool, man.

742
00:35:01,804 --> 00:35:05,215
Actually, we're having a birthday
party for one of them later on today.

743
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:07,457
Hey, is tyrone baking the cake, man?

744
00:35:07,908 --> 00:35:08,908
All right.

745
00:35:10,747 --> 00:35:13,056
I even have a job in prison, man.

746
00:35:13,171 --> 00:35:14,416
Telemarketer, man.

747
00:35:15,232 --> 00:35:16,653
Best seller of this month.

748
00:35:16,942 --> 00:35:17,959
Believe that.

749
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:19,055
Bam.

750
00:35:19,706 --> 00:35:21,211
It's all right in here, man.

751
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:22,590
Don't worry about a thing.

752
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,185
You're gonna have a blast, man.

753
00:35:24,268 --> 00:35:26,040
Okay, this is absolutely pointless.

754
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:27,993
Let's go.
Come on!

755
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:30,194
Thanks for nothing, Darryl.

756
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,720
By the way, you can kiss that recommendation
at your next parole board hearing Sayonara.

757
00:35:35,022 --> 00:35:36,013
That's cool.

758
00:35:36,575 --> 00:35:39,460
I hear we're getting a
frappucino machine next month.

759
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:44,336
So, what goes 10,

760
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,553
9, 8, 7, 6?

761
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:51,013
Bo derek getting old!

762
00:35:55,668 --> 00:35:56,396
Hey.

763
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:57,946
Is this thing on?

764
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:02,582
There is a malicious force
at work in glorious pines!

765
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,982
The recent rash of illnesses here...

766
00:36:05,661 --> 00:36:06,696
not an accident!

767
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:09,209
What the hell's going on here?

768
00:36:09,338 --> 00:36:10,485
He's a Psychic.

769
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:12,181
Maybe he's having an episode.

770
00:36:12,342 --> 00:36:16,833
Yes, and I can feel that the culprit is
right here in this room, and it's you!

771
00:36:16,982 --> 00:36:17,702
Me?

772
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,442
Well, I can't lie.

773
00:36:19,462 --> 00:36:20,816
I've killed on stage.

774
00:36:20,861 --> 00:36:21,861
No, no, no.

775
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,857
Not you.

776
00:36:22,877 --> 00:36:23,656
Her!

777
00:36:23,676 --> 00:36:24,686
Who me?

778
00:36:24,872 --> 00:36:26,758
No, not you.

779
00:36:26,805 --> 00:36:27,568
Her.

780
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,096
Her!

781
00:36:29,116 --> 00:36:30,567
Meredith Cloverfield!

782
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:32,750
What?

783
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,231
A name is coming to my brain.

784
00:36:36,354 --> 00:36:41,354
Help me, help me, help me, help me,
help me, help me, help me, Rhonda!

785
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:44,083
Rhonda Cloverfield.

786
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:47,217
Your dear old mother
at sunshine meadows.

787
00:36:48,397 --> 00:36:51,694
Seventh on the waiting
list to get into the pines.

788
00:36:51,844 --> 00:36:55,914
But you couldn't stand watching
her rot away at that hell hole.

789
00:36:55,974 --> 00:36:58,852
'cause there's no sunshine,
and there's no meadows!

790
00:36:59,192 --> 00:37:00,192
You love her.

791
00:37:00,879 --> 00:37:03,176
So you tried to bump
her up that waitlist.

792
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:05,980
<i>The first thing you did,
break into the pharmacy,</i>

793
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,916
<i>snatch yourself some blood
pressure medication.</i>

794
00:37:10,026 --> 00:37:13,331
And then you targeted the people
that were already taking those pills,

795
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:15,692
whose food you served.

796
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:19,023
Chelsea's bracelets practically
marked 'em for you.

797
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:21,421
First up, Oswald Chester.

798
00:37:22,426 --> 00:37:24,391
<i>You knew he carbed up before a run.</i>

799
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:29,468
<i>It was the perfect opportunity
to make him overdose.</i>

800
00:37:38,193 --> 00:37:39,625
This is outrageous.

801
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:42,262
- I couldn't hurt a fly.
- But you could.

802
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,139
But she did!

803
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:49,882
<i>Almost kill two other
members of this community.</i>

804
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,188
A couple more people,

805
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:03,296
and you and your mother would have
been reunited, and it would have felt...

806
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:05,776
so good.

807
00:38:08,237 --> 00:38:10,418
Talmadge Mcgulager.
Our cover's blown.

808
00:38:12,141 --> 00:38:13,740
Wrap it up, Shawn.
Quick.

809
00:38:20,003 --> 00:38:21,361
Check her pockets for pills!

810
00:38:21,381 --> 00:38:23,110
I think she's got some on her right now!

811
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,852
How dare you?

812
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:26,598
Do you have a prescription for these?

813
00:38:27,046 --> 00:38:30,454
Everyone here in the room with high blood
pressure, your food may be poisoned!

814
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:32,086
That's right. Spit it out!

815
00:38:33,497 --> 00:38:35,592
Get some baggies,
'cause this stuff is evidence.

816
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:38,084
Jervis, baby, slap the cuffs on her.

817
00:38:38,104 --> 00:38:40,844
All I've got is a Rubber
band and some twisty ties.

818
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:42,891
It's fine,
it's great just call the police!

819
00:38:42,911 --> 00:38:44,356
Gotta go!
Peace!

820
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:02,451
Mr. Spencer, good work
on that retirement community case.

821
00:39:02,948 --> 00:39:04,685
Here's your check to show our gratitude.

822
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:05,990
Thank you.

823
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,805
And in case you were wondering,
miss cloverfield made a full confession.

824
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:10,899
I'm sorry, Chief.

825
00:39:11,003 --> 00:39:14,078
This demon spawn is beyond my help.
I've tried threatening him.

826
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,994
I've tried scaring him.
I even tried bribery.

827
00:39:16,014 --> 00:39:19,192
I told you kids want xboxes,
not hot chocolate.

828
00:39:19,362 --> 00:39:21,454
Does anyone know how
to get swiss Miss out of silk?

829
00:39:21,681 --> 00:39:22,755
Lemon wedges.

830
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:26,953
All this kid cares about is what O'hara's
wearing and where she works out.

831
00:39:27,035 --> 00:39:28,403
I'm a little curious myself.

832
00:39:29,528 --> 00:39:33,170
Chief, since he has some
sort of strange attachment to me,

833
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,009
maybe I should try talking to him alone.

834
00:39:36,035 --> 00:39:37,149
Use my office.

835
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,166
Hey, you.

836
00:39:39,621 --> 00:39:40,639
Let's go.

837
00:40:01,403 --> 00:40:02,789
What is going on in there?

838
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:28,106
I'm sorry for all the
trouble I caused earlier.

839
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:29,832
And I promise it won't happen again.

840
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:31,449
Well, I'm

841
00:40:31,854 --> 00:40:33,365
glad I finally got through to you.

842
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:38,269
