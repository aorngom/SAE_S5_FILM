1
00:00:04,923 --> 00:00:06,811
34, 35, okay, that's everybody.

2
00:00:06,936 --> 00:00:08,684
Okay, first stop is the touch pool.

3
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:11,601
Let's line up at the dolphin gate.
Oh, stay with your buddy.

4
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:14,216
Make sure you watch your step
as you enter the aquarium.

5
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:18,937
We did it, Gus.

6
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:21,369
A year of planning's
finally paid off.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,467
Don't you think we should wait
until they get a little further away?

8
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:26,376
No, we have to move now.

9
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:28,527
We've got ten minutes
to find a dolphin,

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,126
feed it, then ride it.

11
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:32,687
Plus my dad being sick
and not being able to chaperone.

12
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:35,438
The fates are with us.
It's the perfect storm.

13
00:00:35,563 --> 00:00:38,145
- I don't want to miss the otters.
- No, we won't.

14
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,543
You brought you dad's camera, right?

15
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:44,581
You're not sick.

16
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:46,379
And you're not very thorough.

17
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:48,501
How did you know?

18
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:51,300
Oh, maybe it's that snorkel
hanging out of your backpack.

19
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:54,261
What kind of undercover operation
are you running here, kid?

20
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,625
Plus...

21
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:57,617
You left this behind.

22
00:01:02,945 --> 00:01:05,398
If you're gonna take time
to create a deception, do it better.

23
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:07,691
Wait.

24
00:01:07,816 --> 00:01:09,860
Dad, I'm confused.
You want me to lie to you?

25
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:11,442
No.

26
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:16,386
I want you to make it more of
a challenge for me to catch you.

27
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:19,787
Because I always will.

28
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,642


29
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:30,840
Wait a minute.
Something's wrong.

30
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:34,044
- What do you mean?
- I mean, this doesn't add up, Gus.

31
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,974
There's not really a burglary ring
at a gentlemen's finishing school.

32
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,105
I'm sorry, Shawn.
I made up a thing about the case.

33
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,093
I need you to come down
here to do me a favor.

34
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:44,754
You know what, this was a bad time.

35
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,266
My dad just got a new fishing boat
and insists on taking me out

36
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:50,627
to kill innocent fish, and I can only
avoid so many things at the same...

37
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,150
time.

38
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:53,913
All right, what is it?

39
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,656
It's a funeral.

40
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:57,769
No.
Absolutely not.

41
00:01:57,894 --> 00:01:59,942
You know I hate funerals.
They're depressing.

42
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:04,039
There's organ music, and six times out
of ten, there's a snake in the casket.

43
00:02:04,313 --> 00:02:05,746
We'll just go really quick.

44
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:07,293
I need someone to support me.

45
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:12,965
All right.
Who's it for?

46
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:22,944
Would you please
just tell me who died?

47
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,944
I don't like all this secrecy, Gus.

48
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:28,498
And what's with the aquatic theme?
All this ocean society stuff?

49
00:02:28,623 --> 00:02:29,945
Did Jack Custo die?

50
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,633
Jacques Cousteau died in 1995.

51
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:34,446
I don't think these people
got the memo.

52
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,570
Come on. Who died?
Who was it?

53
00:02:36,695 --> 00:02:38,365
One of those guys?
The boat guys?

54
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,200
Was there some kind of accident?

55
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:43,175
Dude, I got it.

56
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,790
It's the guy with
the horn-rimmed glasses.

57
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,459
If there was ever somebody
with one foot in the grave...

58
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:52,112
Sorry.

59
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,699
You know, the camera adds ten years.

60
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:56,550
- It's ten pounds.
- Shh. Just shh.

61
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,446
Wait a minute.

62
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:10,815
Is this a funeral for a sea lion?

63
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:12,983
Yes.
Yes, it is.

64
00:03:13,264 --> 00:03:16,487
And don't start, Shawn.
Shabby's more than just a sea lion.

65
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,447
He's a local hero
and a heart warming story.

66
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,529
I can't believe you made me put
on a dress shirt

67
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:22,451
- for something with flippers.
- The ocean

68
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,540
is a little smaller today

69
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:26,436
with the loss of this...

70
00:03:27,297 --> 00:03:29,041
inspirational guy.

71
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:30,985
Is that Randy Labayda?

72
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:34,338
They got Randy Labayda
from Animal Planet.

73
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:36,013
If sea creatures could cry,

74
00:03:36,138 --> 00:03:38,350
their tears would cause

75
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:42,179
the water level of all the oceans
of the world

76
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:45,641
to rise an alarming 2 1/2 inches.

77
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:48,811
But Shabby would want us to rejoice.

78
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,576
I was the last person
to see him alive.

79
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,316
And some people think I'm crazy
to believe this, but...

80
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,652
as I returned him to his home,

81
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,863
sweet mother ocean,

82
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:01,351
I thought I actually saw him...

83
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,701
Wink at me.

84
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,161
Just how famous was this sea lion?

85
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,771
He's the big local
story of the year.

86
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:11,041
He was rescued
by the aquarium people.

87
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,961
Remember?
Floating on that loose raft?

88
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,964
Then he died tragically after
being released out into the wild.

89
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:18,596
Come and grieve.

90
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:22,767
It's a poignant story, and I need
you to support me in my time of need.

91
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,266
You have got to be kidding me.
This is an open casket?

92
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:30,700
Shabby.

93
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,754
You almost made it.

94
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:37,718
But you touched our hearts.

95
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:38,944
And our souls.

96
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:42,531
Be free swimming
in the ocean of heaven

97
00:04:42,803 --> 00:04:44,742
where there are
no natural predators.

98
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,327
Good speech.

99
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:47,702
Your turn.

100
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:50,321
Are you kidding me?

101
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:56,074
Shabby, buddy,

102
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:59,214
you lived a full life, I guess.

103
00:05:00,102 --> 00:05:03,427
You probably balanced a beach ball
on your nose at some point.

104
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:06,855
Maybe honked a horn with your mouth.

105
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:11,018
Barked the melody of <i>Grand old flag</i>.

106
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:12,937
Clearly, you...

107
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:14,858
Ate very well.

108
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,900
Oh, no.

109
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,655
What?

110
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:25,991
I think this sea lion was murdered.

111
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,384
synchro : IceFreak, Arrow, golgi

112
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:47,095
www.sub-way.fr / www.seriessub.com

113
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,393
- Why do you hate me?
- I don't hate you.

114
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,769
I am telling you. There's something
unnatural going on here.

115
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,834
We should go back to the aquarium and
check out Shabby's cage or something.

116
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,898
He wasn't in an exhibit.
He was in the ocean.

117
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,081
He was released back into
the wild three days ago.

118
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:02,743
Gentlemen,
I'm gonna need to see you for a moment.

119
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,956
Great. Now you got
me kicked out of a funeral.

120
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:07,599
Nice.
Just add it to the list.

121
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:10,008
Kicked out of PetSmart,
kicked out of Santa's village,

122
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:13,163
- kicked out of the salvation army...
- Dishonorably discharged.

123
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:15,957
- Now what do you mean...
- I apologize.

124
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:18,205
He's angry because
I tricked him into coming.

125
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,588
I'm a conservationist.

126
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,781
I'm an annual pass
holder at the aquarium.

127
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:24,753
I'm a registered aqua-blogger
with topic-starting privileges

128
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:28,129
and level three thread management
on the sea lion message boards.

129
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:31,765
I want to know what you mean,
"he was murdered."

130
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:35,599
I'm a psychic.
I work with the SBPD.

131
00:06:35,724 --> 00:06:38,815
I also make my own salt water taffy.
Wait... wait a minute.

132
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,297
Why do you ask that?

133
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:44,652
Because I have seen some
suspicious things at that aquarium.

134
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,783
We can't talk here.
Is there somewhere we can meet?

135
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,035
Yes.

136
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:57,541
- Dude, what are you doing?
- Cleaning up.

137
00:06:57,907 --> 00:06:59,711
- But why?
- This place is a mess,

138
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:02,304
and it's not all the time
we have an attractive conservationist

139
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:03,596
come by the office.

140
00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:05,924
Oh, and by the way, I call her.

141
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:08,510
What do you mean, you call her?
You can't call a person.

142
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:09,762
Why not?

143
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,759
Because I already called
her at the funeral.

144
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:13,599
- You did not.
- She touched me, Gus.

145
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,734
That's because you bumped into her.

146
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:17,401
Doesn't matter.

147
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:19,563
Contact is contact.
It's the rule, buddy.

148
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,357
You know what?

149
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:23,800
Get ready for battle.

150
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:26,024
Get ready for battle.
Come on.

151
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:29,510
This is ridiculous. We can't go
to battle over a girl we don't know.

152
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:30,762
I'll back off.

153
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,743
You'll back off?
Why?

154
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:34,787
Because this is silly.

155
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:37,762
Look, you do your thing, you work it,
and I'll stay out of the way.

156
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,042
You think I can't get
a girl on my own.

157
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:41,835
Fine.
I'll back off.

158
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,912
I already backed off.
Too bad.

159
00:07:44,037 --> 00:07:45,005
Backed off what?

160
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:51,785
Well, I was in charge of
Shabby's rehabilitation, and

161
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,640
a lot of unexplained
things happened.

162
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,459
First of all, they moved up
the date of his release

163
00:07:57,584 --> 00:07:59,349
by six days.

164
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:01,702
And why did they do that?

165
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:06,401
Randy Labayda.

166
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,030
From the funeral?

167
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:13,568
And pacific ocean aqua patrol, yeah.

168
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,714
I used to watch that show after
wrestling practice in high school.

169
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,108
I was the captain.

170
00:08:20,004 --> 00:08:21,314
The aquarium...

171
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,111
did a personal appearance deal
with him a couple months ago.

172
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:27,413
Put him on the ads.
Build a Randy Labayda manta ray tank.

173
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:28,257
What?

174
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,426
And someone wanted him to be
the one to release Shabby.

175
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,470
And you didn't want that to happen?

176
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:34,723
Well, no.

177
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,912
- It was too soon.
- Of course.

178
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:38,913
Labayda shanghaied the whole thing.

179
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,521
It was supposed to be a quiet
release with a local photographer.

180
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,550
I got to the dock,

181
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:47,913
the photographer had been canceled,
and I wasn't even allowed on the boat.

182
00:08:48,038 --> 00:08:50,296
No aquarium staff whatsoever.

183
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,339
And I never got to see him again.

184
00:08:53,464 --> 00:08:55,409
That is so awful.

185
00:08:57,294 --> 00:08:58,411
So, uh...

186
00:08:59,384 --> 00:09:01,075
What happened out on the boat?

187
00:09:01,465 --> 00:09:02,918
No one knows.

188
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,004
Everyone got back late,
and a little upset.

189
00:09:06,496 --> 00:09:09,732
Then they locked up the ship's log
in Labayda's office at the aquarium.

190
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:13,135
April, we're going to need to get into
that office, so that I can feel things.

191
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,221
I can get you in.

192
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,347
How soon?

193
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:19,336
Tonight.

194
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:24,976
Are you wearing sweatpants?

195
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:27,580
These are my "sneaking around" pants.
Don't be jealous.

196
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:28,976
I got you a matching pair.

197
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,923
- You're dressing up for her.
- Dressing up?

198
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,793
Dude, I'm wearing sweats
and this ridiculous lime green jacket.

199
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:36,852
That's my lime green jacket, Shawn.
And it's only for players.

200
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,237
Okay, look, I backed off.
You need to get over it.

201
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
This is it.

202
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:45,918
What, is there, like,
a hidden door in the rock wall?

203
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,630
You said you can get us in.

204
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:50,923
Yeah, I, uh...

205
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,424
I can give you a boost.

206
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,043
The electrified security
fence is broken here.

207
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:57,374
Unless they fixed it.

208
00:09:58,501 --> 00:09:59,680
You don't work here?

209
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:04,168
Well, technically, no.
I did, until Tuesday.

210
00:10:04,293 --> 00:10:08,169
I was asking too many questions, and
Labayda's producer Tim had me canned.

211
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:10,425
Which is why I asked for your help.

212
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,445
- You want us to scale a wall.
- Is it too high?

213
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:17,630
I could probably free jump it
if the ground wasn't so wet.

214
00:10:17,755 --> 00:10:19,318
- You could not.
- I could vault it.

215
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:21,168
- Where would you land?
- Okay, listen.

216
00:10:21,644 --> 00:10:24,331
There's a door right on
the other side of this wall.

217
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,752
It'll lead you straight
towards Labayda's office.

218
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,940
The code is 1-8-4-2.

219
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:31,672
If I'm wrong, you can just leave.

220
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:35,050
If it doesn't work,
we're probably going to jail.

221
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:38,545
Who's first?

222
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:39,981
Come on.

223
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:47,130
See?
She's legit.

224
00:10:47,468 --> 00:10:50,077
- Legit?
- She just boosted us over a wall.

225
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:52,776
She does have very impressive
strength for a girl her size.

226
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:56,574
Coolest office ever.

227
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,617
Hello!

228
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:07,467
What's this?

229
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:12,485
Wait a minute.

230
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:13,969
Dude.

231
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:19,210
He has two laptops.
Why lock up this laptop over that one?

232
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:26,137
Why does this have a GPS on it?

233
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:28,566
It's the only software
on this computer.

234
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,995
And it's not picking up anything.

235
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:36,639
Can we stop playing with this guy's
computer and get to the ship's log?

236
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,364
Yeah. Knock yourself out.

237
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:45,287
This is all wrong.

238
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,821
They were supposed to release
Shabby near San Miguel island.

239
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,298
Where they let him off is
nowhere near close to there.

240
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,753
Why would they do that?

241
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:55,252
We need to get out of here.

242
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,632
Good-bye.

243
00:11:58,655 --> 00:12:00,797
- Okay, let's get out of here.
- All right.

244
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:03,172
- But wait, there's one more thing.
- What?

245
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:05,074
I have unfinished business here.

246
00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:07,319
And a date with destiny.

247
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:12,260
No, you are not swimming
with the dolphins.

248
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:14,156
When are we gonna have
another chance?

249
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:16,935
- I don't care, Shawn.
- I'm in, I'm on, I'm out.

250
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:20,225
Hopefully, they have a harness,
or a small saddle of some sort.

251
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,965
I charged up my camera.
You don't have to worry about the flash.

252
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,791
It's all digital.
Just keep on snapping.

253
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,041
We are leaving.

254
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,388
I'm gonna ride that dolphin
into modern history.

255
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:30,832
- I'm going up top.
- I'm staying here.

256
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,001
You're missing out on
the opportunity of a life.

257
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,211
Please.

258
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,858
That dolphin
is not gonna ride itself.

259
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:39,532
Shawn, get back here!

260
00:13:57,594 --> 00:13:58,742
Get out of here.

261
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:00,244
Not now.

262
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,425
Quiet!

263
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,844
Pa does not love Fa.

264
00:14:07,853 --> 00:14:10,098
No, Pa doesnot love Fa!

265
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:12,044
You're not listening.

266
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:13,899
Stop doing that.

267
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:19,339
What the hell are you doing?

268
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:21,411
Conducting an investigation,
thank you very much.

269
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:24,353
- Then why do you smell like herring?
- Because this is an aquarium.

270
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,946
You're feeding him.

271
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,409
We're about to go to jail,
and you're training dolphins?

272
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,510
He insisted.
I had no choice in the matter.

273
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:33,428
I said "Pa does not love Fa."

274
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:36,134
And your hands are filthy.

275
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:38,571
Do you realize how many germs
you can transmit like that?

276
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:40,429
- Here, give me that.
- No.

277
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:47,344
- Here, dolphin.
- You just want to feed him yourself!

278
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,932
I'm getting rid of the evidence.

279
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:50,530
And yes, it's not fair that you,

280
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,365
who cares less
than me about marine life

281
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,902
gets to feed them, and I don't.

282
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,087
Just throw it
and let's get out of here.

283
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,829
Don't make a move!

284
00:14:58,383 --> 00:15:00,982
Drop the fish, sir,
and nobody gets hurt.

285
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:10,197
Breaking and entering?

286
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:14,150
It was really just entering.
Climbing and entering. We had the code.

287
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:16,410
- Is that a backstage pass?
- And a Dolce jacket?

288
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:18,625
I have third row center
at Phil Collins tonight,

289
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:22,328
and I get called back here because
my department psychic wanted to break

290
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:25,674
- into an aquarium to feed some fish?
- That is not entirely true.

291
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,633
Then why were you wearing
swim trunks,

292
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:29,594
carrying a "how to ride a dolphin"
pamphlet?

293
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,931
That's a long story. But the truth is
we're on the trail of something.

294
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,558
- Something big.
- Important.

295
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,020
Slightly sexy.

296
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:39,509
Chief.
I think I can shed some light on this.

297
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,198
This is April MacArthur.

298
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:44,942
I did it. I couldn't let you guys
take the fall for me.

299
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,697
I'm sorry, miss, you broke
into the Santa Barbara aquarium?

300
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,493
I led them to believe that I was still
an employee at the aquarium.

301
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:57,330
I got them the code for the alarm,
and got them into the facility.

302
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:00,709
She was also able to inexplicably
lift us over a security wall.

303
00:16:01,723 --> 00:16:05,088
Chief, she has good reason.
She was actually acting heroically.

304
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:08,146
- Thank you, Juliet.
- No, thank you.

305
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:11,687
And I like those earrings.
Chief, there may have been a murder.

306
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:14,764
- I can't believe poor Shabby is dead.
- You too, Jules?

307
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,933
The Shabby-cam is my screensaver.

308
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:20,687
- We can all learn from him.
- Wait, who's Shabby?

309
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,467
- You don't wanna know.
- I don't?

310
00:16:22,592 --> 00:16:25,834
Yeah, probably not.
Just know I am taking lead on this case.

311
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:29,446
There is a crime at play, trust me.
I will straighten out these aquarium.

312
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:32,115
They do not want to press charges
at all. They like her.

313
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,571
And so do I. We do not want to arrest
this woman. We need to help her.

314
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:39,789
Thank you for that endorsement,
O'Hara. Now,

315
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:43,031
I have to get back to the bowl,
and somebody needs to take me,

316
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,223
because if I miss <i>Against all odds</i>,
then somebody is getting fired.

317
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:49,776
I missed it?

318
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:51,748
They released you already?

319
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,090
It was all a big misunderstanding.
We're working a case.

320
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,569
Jules is helping out.

321
00:16:56,694 --> 00:16:58,561
We are solving a heinous crime.

322
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:00,078
Heinous crime.

323
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:01,889
Wait a minute.

324
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,993
How heinous?

325
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,567
It's not a big deal. There may have been
a murder. We've got it covered.

326
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:09,451
Just need a name.

327
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:11,338
I'd rather not.

328
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,595
You guys don't know what I've been
through these last couple weeks.

329
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,160
- I chased down diamond smugglers.
- Congratulations.

330
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:20,908
Not exactly. I chased them to an airport
where a plane was waiting. Wait.

331
00:17:21,547 --> 00:17:24,292
- What does "Rocinante" mean to you?
- A full-body Syrah.

332
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,003
- A gay couple from Lisbon.
- It was the name of their plane.

333
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,884
Flew off into a lightening storm.
I wanted to chase them, but apparently,

334
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:32,348
our helicopters only fly
when there's rainbows in the sky.

335
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:35,377
They got away clean, which means
I'm officially jackass N° 1 around here.

336
00:17:35,502 --> 00:17:36,805
I need a case.

337
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:39,808
Give me the victim's name.

338
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,969
- What's that, street name?
- It's more of a given name.

339
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:52,411
- Last name?
- He doesn't have one.

340
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:53,780
Do not play with me.

341
00:17:54,886 --> 00:17:56,877
- Can I spell it?
- I don't care.

342
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,953
- T-h-e.
- T-h-e.

343
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:02,666
- S-e-a...
- S-e-a...

344
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,768
L-i-o...

345
00:18:06,664 --> 00:18:07,406
n.

346
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:08,837
Thesealion.

347
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,384
What is that, french?

348
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:14,477
- Pinniped.
- Pinniped.

349
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,761
Never heard of it.
All right, description.

350
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:18,847
- Black.
- Black. Height and weight?

351
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:21,224
6... 700 pounds.

352
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:22,599
Jeez, Louise.

353
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,019
- Can you get a body exhumed?
- Of course I can.

354
00:18:25,422 --> 00:18:27,366
As long as I'm in on the autopsy.

355
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,738
I'm gonna kill you, Spencer.

356
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:38,749
I never told you
that the victim wasn't a sea lion.

357
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:40,618
I tried to keep you out of this.

358
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,472
- How long is this going to take?
- I don't know.

359
00:18:43,678 --> 00:18:45,738
I've never examined
one of these things before.

360
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:47,000
That's fair.

361
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,545
Are there any signs of...
I don't know, foul play?

362
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:54,632
A couple things are odd.
I found a strange, empty piercing.

363
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,853
Maybe he started swimming
with the wrong crowd.

364
00:18:56,978 --> 00:18:59,805
You didn't happen to find any tattoos,
did you?

365
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,515
I found some flat reef coral
in the fur.

366
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,681
- How's that possible?
- Yeah, coral, in the ocean?

367
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:09,141
- Are you really asking that question?
- A sea lion is a precision animal.

368
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:11,566
It knows how to swim
around a reef without thrashing into it.

369
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,861
- That's true.
- And I found some synthetic fibers.

370
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:17,572
Okay, what kind of fibers?

371
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,033
Monofilament line.
The kind found in fishing nets.

372
00:19:20,503 --> 00:19:23,254
All right, I've heard enough.
Close this thing up. Let's go, O'Hara.

373
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:25,538
- You're not being very helpful now.
- Really,

374
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,124
let me see if I can close this case
for you now. I'm no expert,

375
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,997
but let me take a shot.
You've got a sea lion,

376
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,130
you've got a net, and you've got
the ocean. You put them all together...

377
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:36,018
Case closed.

378
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:43,270
What?

379
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:46,226
- I'm worried he might be right.
- Are you serious?

380
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,730
I don't know, Gus.

381
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:51,981
We definitely need to see that reef.
And I know how we can get out there.

382
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,825
All right, that's it, that's it.
Your hands are at 10:00 and 2:00.

383
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,572
Down there, that's your trim tab.

384
00:20:03,697 --> 00:20:06,445
Over there, your heat gauge.
That's your fishfinder GPS.

385
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,040
Uses waypoints, just like in a car,
when you find a place you like.

386
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,939
You got a little microwave in there.

387
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:12,922
Please focus. Look forward.

388
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,760
Do not become complacent
just because it's water.

389
00:20:16,221 --> 00:20:17,807
Dad, we're still in the dock.

390
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:20,938
Do you want to drive
this thing or not?

391
00:20:21,063 --> 00:20:23,317
I never asked that.
Isn't that right, Gus?

392
00:20:23,442 --> 00:20:26,110
- I'm gonna get in the middle of that.
- Man, I just wanted to come,

393
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:28,754
see your new boat,
go out onto the reef.

394
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:31,863
The reef? I'm not going out on the reef.
That place is restricted waters.

395
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:34,704
- What if I told you it was for a case?
- That would make it worse.

396
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:36,767
- But what if he didn't?
- We won't tell anyone.

397
00:20:36,892 --> 00:20:38,524
We totally promise. Plus,

398
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:40,705
- we'll totally solve a crime.
- Please listen to me.

399
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,588
I'm not going out onto the reef.

400
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:45,329
That place is off-limits to people.
I'm not gonna lose my boat,

401
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:48,859
I'm not gonna lose my license to follow
some stupid, lame-ass hunch of yours.

402
00:20:48,984 --> 00:20:51,792
- You're really not gonna budge on this?
- What do you think?

403
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:55,540
- Told you.
- All right, all right, I do.

404
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:58,214
- I want to learn how to drive.
- You know what, hold up a second.

405
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,163
I'm gonna grab my tackle box.

406
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:08,064
- Don't worry. It's cool.
- What are you doing?

407
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:09,225
Get back here!

408
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,961
- He's gonna come after us.
- He can't swim that fast.

409
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:13,821
Besides, he wanted me to do this.

410
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,622
He wanted you to steal his boat?

411
00:21:18,062 --> 00:21:20,987
He didn't wanna be responsible for
crossing over into restricted waters.

412
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,777
Didn't you get that with the whole
"Shawn, let me show you how to drive"?

413
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:27,243
- He wanted to show you how to drive.
- Yeah, so I could steal it later.

414
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,464
This thing is all numbers.
It's very hard to read.

415
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:43,635
- Maybe it's upside down.
- First of all, that's a Thomas guide.

416
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:47,087
Thought it was a little land-heavy.
But look,

417
00:21:47,212 --> 00:21:49,769
I think the reef is down here
in the corner, A-7.

418
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:53,190
Did you listen to anything
your dad said? The map is the screen.

419
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:56,940
Don't be exactly half
of an 11-pound black forest ham.

420
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:00,109
- That's clearly the GPS.
- Exactly, it's latitude and longitude.

421
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:01,819
You follow the degrees.

422
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:06,883
That what those numbers
with the little quotation marks are?

423
00:22:11,377 --> 00:22:13,506
Dude, I think I know
where it may have gone down.

424
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:17,335
That laptop was probably tracking
Labayda's boat. Here, punch this in.

425
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,207
34 degrees, zero, six,

426
00:22:20,332 --> 00:22:22,764
and then one of those little lines
that I would use to...

427
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:24,424
To make a winking face in a text.

428
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:27,693
Go back. It should be the left eye
that's winking, not the right.

429
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:29,754
Pretend the person
doesn't even have a right eye.

430
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:32,684
Like, no ocular socket what so ever.
It was sutured shut from birth.

431
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,185
- I got it.
- That's it.

432
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,038
Right there, that's good, okay.
Now 50 degrees...

433
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,921
Two degrees to the right.
No, up.

434
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:46,492
Two degrees up. What do
those two little dots mean again?

435
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,449
- Kick out the lights.
- We're getting close.

436
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,582
- We're right on top of it.
- Kick out the lights.

437
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:52,525
- Why?
- I think I see another boat out

438
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,718
in the distance.

439
00:22:54,376 --> 00:22:56,624
- Where's another boat?
- It doesn't matter where.

440
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,460
We're in restricted waters. I can't
get arrested twice in the same week.

441
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,592
You might have a few arrests in you,
but I don't.

442
00:23:01,717 --> 00:23:02,505
Fine.

443
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:12,849
- Did you hear something?
- Like what?

444
00:23:13,662 --> 00:23:14,392
Like...

445
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,440
voices.

446
00:23:21,804 --> 00:23:23,023
- Take him!
- What?

447
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:25,648
I had this dream before.
Ever since we saw <i>Dead Calm</i>.

448
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:27,564
- You have to take one for the team.
- What?

449
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:29,930
- Take one for the team!
- No one's gonna hurt us.

450
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,868
These are restricted waters.
What the heck are you doing out here?

451
00:23:32,993 --> 00:23:34,076
Ahoy there!

452
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,887
Right! My name is Shawn Spencer.

453
00:23:38,012 --> 00:23:40,653
This is my first mate
hummingbird Saltalamaccia.

454
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,263
We were turned around.
Discombobulated.

455
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:46,700
We just now realized
that we were in restricted waters.

456
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:47,825
Just now.

457
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:50,353
- And we both have hepatis.
- I also couldn't help,

458
00:23:50,478 --> 00:23:52,728
but notice
you are not the coast guard.

459
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:56,142
We thought you were the coast guard,
coming to tow us in.

460
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:56,976
Us?

461
00:23:59,496 --> 00:24:02,579
But does that mean that they're coming?
And if so, do you have an E.T.A.?

462
00:24:02,704 --> 00:24:05,580
No idea, we just...
we've been drifting for about an hour.

463
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:07,705
We stalled on our way to Monterey.

464
00:24:08,076 --> 00:24:09,648
Old Me-hi-co.

465
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:12,075
Monterey,
Mexico is 2,000 miles inland.

466
00:24:12,461 --> 00:24:13,494
Up north.

467
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:16,387
So what are you guys doing out here?

468
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:17,715
You know.

469
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,665
Just hiding from sharks.
We heard that they can see you

470
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,089
if your lights are on,
so we kicked ours off.

471
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:27,292
That's not how sharks work at all.

472
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:29,759
Regular sharks.
Of course, right.

473
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,949
But we heard there was an infestation
of genetically-altered shark-like beasts

474
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:36,845
here, in this area of the water.

475
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:39,586
- They can smell the light.
- They also type.

476
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:40,912
- True.
- What?

477
00:24:41,118 --> 00:24:42,120
Not well,

478
00:24:42,495 --> 00:24:44,629
but they're sharks, with fins,

479
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:46,356
so it's still impressive.

480
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:51,161
How long, did you say,
before the coast guard gets here?

481
00:24:51,286 --> 00:24:54,422
They're not just right around the corner
or anything are they?

482
00:24:55,848 --> 00:24:58,509
I'm telling you,
here's something wrong with those guys.

483
00:24:58,634 --> 00:25:00,709
Did you wanna stay out there
and chat it up with them?

484
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:04,585
No, but we may not be the only ones out
there looking for the sea lion's killer.

485
00:25:07,443 --> 00:25:09,156
Maybe he didn't want me
to take the boat.

486
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:11,958
- I'm jumping out here.
- Okay, but you're gonna get wet.

487
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:15,304
I can't believe this. I'm gonna get
arrested two times in one week.

488
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:19,595
Okay, Dad, we have to come up
with a system for unspoken actions.

489
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,436
- I can't believe you called the cops.
- I didn't call them.

490
00:25:22,902 --> 00:25:24,057
They called me.

491
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:26,732
- Why?
- Coroner finished his inquiry.

492
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,115
He found a bullet
inside the sea lion.

493
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,028
Two.22 slugs, actually.

494
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:33,979
- He was shot?
- He was murdered.

495
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:44,872
So am I going to need a lawyer?
'Cause mine's on a boat

496
00:25:45,134 --> 00:25:46,261
off Cape Horn.

497
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:48,129
It might take a while.

498
00:25:48,605 --> 00:25:51,047
Mr. Labayda, would you remove
that bird from your shoulder?

499
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:54,719
This is an australian hissing owl.

500
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:58,501
And I have to do a show
with him in about three hours.

501
00:25:58,626 --> 00:26:00,427
If I haven't bonded
with him by then,

502
00:26:00,552 --> 00:26:03,991
he will spend the entire shoot crapping
all over my Ed Hardy tee.

503
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:05,343
Now...

504
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:08,232
I would appreciate it
if you would watch your tone,

505
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:10,151
because this thing's like a sponge.

506
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,959
And he can get really aggressive
when things...

507
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:14,697
get tense.

508
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:16,949
Detective, telephone.

509
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:19,444
- I'm in the middle of something.
- It's the FBI.

510
00:26:19,762 --> 00:26:21,487
Again? Would you tell them
I didn't know

511
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:23,748
they were smugglers
until it was too late? And tell them

512
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,044
if I had access to my own plane, I could
follow the Rocinante into the storm.

513
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,045
Maybe you should tell them yourself.

514
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:31,184
Right.

515
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,276
Didn't I have her fired?

516
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:43,521
- Is that your source?
- No.

517
00:26:44,078 --> 00:26:45,811
Mr. Labayda,
our source is the court.

518
00:26:46,383 --> 00:26:48,940
As in a court-sanctioned search
we did of your office.

519
00:26:49,297 --> 00:26:51,533
We found animal tracking software
on your computer.

520
00:26:51,658 --> 00:26:53,236
We don't tag our animals.

521
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,821
Once they're released into the wild,
they're free.

522
00:26:56,464 --> 00:26:58,032
Perhaps you'd like to explain.

523
00:27:02,378 --> 00:27:04,312
I need someone to take the bird.

524
00:27:06,456 --> 00:27:07,333
All right.

525
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:12,006
We were gonna track him.
But it was such a great,

526
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,411
heartwarming local story.
It would have been a great national one.

527
00:27:15,536 --> 00:27:17,349
I mean, you can't blame me for...

528
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:20,657
wanting the people to know
what happened to this...

529
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:22,640
special creature.

530
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:26,452
We need to know why you released him

531
00:27:26,577 --> 00:27:28,521
miles away from
where you were supposed to.

532
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,581
I...

533
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:37,639
think I'd like to make
my phone call now.

534
00:27:37,764 --> 00:27:39,710
Yeah, I bet you would.

535
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:45,013
Labayda's Sea Adventure.

536
00:27:45,868 --> 00:27:47,164
Burn the disks.

537
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,914
Is this you, boss?

538
00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:51,961
Destroy the footage.
Take a vacation in Mexico

539
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:55,912
<i>- for at least a week, can you do that?
- I can't get to the footage right now.</i>

540
00:27:56,037 --> 00:27:57,041
Why not?

541
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,768
Because your two hair analysts
are reviewing it right now.

542
00:28:00,664 --> 00:28:02,722
I don't have a hair analyst.

543
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,307
<i>Who set that up?</i>

544
00:28:04,646 --> 00:28:05,482
Crap.

545
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:08,251
<i>Get over there, now!</i>

546
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:12,481
Hair analyst?
That worked?

547
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,752
I've always dreamed
of having one myself.

548
00:28:14,877 --> 00:28:17,077
<i>I need the sunset
perfectly framing...</i>

549
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:21,005
<i>the silhouette.
It has to be me</i>

550
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,283
<i>and the wild.</i>

551
00:28:22,597 --> 00:28:26,599
<i>All right, let me just say, you see
a single strand of my hair out of place,</i>

552
00:28:27,258 --> 00:28:29,874
<i>let me know, we cut right then
and there. That includes chest hair.</i>

553
00:28:30,187 --> 00:28:31,938
<i>- Timmy, you got me?
- I got it.</i>

554
00:28:32,063 --> 00:28:34,193
<i>All right, here we go.
All right, three...</i>

555
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:35,796
- <i>What?
- Freighter.</i>

556
00:28:35,921 --> 00:28:36,921
<i>What?</i>

557
00:28:38,807 --> 00:28:40,554
<i>No, get out of the way!</i>

558
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:43,179
<i>Get your big,
polluting ass out of my shot.</i>

559
00:28:43,678 --> 00:28:45,598
<i>How many boats are there gonna be?</i>

560
00:28:47,914 --> 00:28:50,468
<i>Okay, rock blocks it perfectly.</i>

561
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,107
<i>I guess this'll just have to do.</i>

562
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:56,404
<i>I don't like it.</i>

563
00:28:56,629 --> 00:28:59,111
<i>I want to go on record
saying I don't like it.</i>

564
00:29:01,221 --> 00:29:03,856
He's not a murderer.
He's just an egomaniac.

565
00:29:04,071 --> 00:29:06,285
And for fairly good reason.
His hair is spectacular.

566
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:07,954
<i>Swim!</i>

567
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:09,872
<i>Swim, my friend.</i>

568
00:29:10,157 --> 00:29:13,349
He released Shabby
in the wrong place to get a better shot.

569
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:16,629
That means Shabby was just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

570
00:29:17,202 --> 00:29:18,451
<i>Arrivederci,</i>

571
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:21,842
<i>my furry little Michael Phelps.</i>

572
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,260
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

573
00:29:23,632 --> 00:29:26,138
He didn't shoot him.
He didn't do it.

574
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:29,141
<i>Yeah, pumas are pretty mean.</i>

575
00:29:29,674 --> 00:29:31,685
<i>I know one time,
I ran into a puma...</i>

576
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:37,200
Look at that.
That's the same boat we saw.

577
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:38,832
It's the same guys.

578
00:29:39,548 --> 00:29:41,070
It was five days ago.

579
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:45,491
We've been drifting for about an hour.
We stalled on our way to Monterey.

580
00:29:46,842 --> 00:29:49,923
- They weren't on their way to Monterey.
- They were on their way to the reef.

581
00:29:50,048 --> 00:29:52,097
The reef,
where Shabby went off the grid.

582
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:54,614
Why would they be going out there
at night?

583
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:55,699
Guys?

584
00:29:56,103 --> 00:29:57,305
Out of there!

585
00:29:57,834 --> 00:29:59,843
- Plan A or plan B?
- B.

586
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:06,679
Oh, my God, I killed him!

587
00:30:15,544 --> 00:30:17,800
Shawn, you can't steal
your dad's boat for a second time.

588
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:20,898
Gus, you don't understand.
My dad wants me to do this.

589
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:23,898
Do I, Shawn?

590
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:31,745
You were really good with him.

591
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,747
So were you.
You really scared him.

592
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:35,207
And the bird.

593
00:30:39,078 --> 00:30:41,906
I don't know
if this is the right time to ask,

594
00:30:42,197 --> 00:30:44,383
- but what about Shawn?
- What about him?

595
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:46,794
I don't know.

596
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:48,122
Something...

597
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:50,256
Intriguing.

598
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:52,391
You know, odd.
It's refreshing.

599
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:55,686
I was thinking of letting him
know that I'm,

600
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:57,084
available.

601
00:30:57,209 --> 00:30:59,523
You know, and all that.
What do you think?

602
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:02,735
Well, I don't know.

603
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,036
- Is there a problem?
- No.

604
00:31:05,161 --> 00:31:06,491
No, there's no problem.

605
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,242
- Your dad's getting pretty good.
- Too good.

606
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:12,644
I think he's been waiting
in there since Thursday.

607
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:15,419
It's pretty creepy,
and mildly impressive.

608
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:20,447
Opportunity.

609
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:33,955
They're going that way.
We gonna follow them or not?

610
00:31:34,084 --> 00:31:36,086
I'm definitely a "not" right now.

611
00:31:38,144 --> 00:31:39,547
They might be coming back.

612
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:41,830
They're in the opposite direction,
It's our best chance.

613
00:31:41,955 --> 00:31:44,360
- They're going to get help.
- They're unloading stuff.

614
00:31:44,588 --> 00:31:46,445
- Barnacle Bill.
- What?

615
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:51,989
- Hawkeye or Crow's nest?
- What do either of those mean?

616
00:31:52,114 --> 00:31:54,417
I don't know.
I was hoping you did.

617
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:59,166
What is all this stuff?

618
00:31:59,573 --> 00:32:03,003
GPS, radar, sonar,
electronic pulse sensors.

619
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,504
High-tech stuff.

620
00:32:05,078 --> 00:32:07,013
That's how they knew
we were in the water.

621
00:32:07,138 --> 00:32:10,010
Whatever they were doing,
they didn't wanna be found.

622
00:32:11,794 --> 00:32:13,580
And they were doing it at night.

623
00:32:13,705 --> 00:32:15,224
It's a bunch of salvage equipment.

624
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:16,966
Wait a minute.

625
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:29,917
We need to get this thing off.

626
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:39,081
- What are we looking for?
- This thing, this thing, this thing!

627
00:32:39,265 --> 00:32:41,765
Here, let me do it.
I was a Navy scout.

628
00:32:43,704 --> 00:32:46,046
- This is a satellite tracking tag.
- What's it for?

629
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,757
They use it for tagging animals,
training, research.

630
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,068
<i>A couple of things are odd.</i>

631
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,972
- <i>I found a strange empty piercing.
- Why does this have a GPS on it?</i>

632
00:32:56,267 --> 00:32:58,467
Labayda was tracking the sea lion.

633
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:04,097
<i>He found a bullet
inside the sea lion.</i>

634
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:05,858
<i>Two.22 slugs, actually.</i>

635
00:33:09,271 --> 00:33:11,322
- They killed him, Shawn.
- Why?

636
00:33:12,025 --> 00:33:13,365
We should go.

637
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,349
They're coming.
They're gonna see us.

638
00:33:17,474 --> 00:33:19,591
- Hang from the anchor.
- That only works in cartoons.

639
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:22,541
- Is there a shark cage?
- How could it be a good idea?

640
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,210
I don't know.
At least I'm coming up with some ideas.

641
00:33:26,316 --> 00:33:29,298
- I saw the boat rocking, I swear.
- It's fine.

642
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:35,387
- There's no one. Everything's fine.
- I saw something. I'm telling you.

643
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,588
You're paranoid, man.
We're in the home stretch here.

644
00:33:38,713 --> 00:33:39,516
Let's go.

645
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:46,050
Dude, this is like out of sight,
but super gay.

646
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:48,859
- Don't touch me, Shawn.
- Wait, wait.

647
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,030
- You hear that?
- Hear what?

648
00:33:53,452 --> 00:33:55,699
All right, all right,
I'm just nervous, man.

649
00:33:56,174 --> 00:33:57,624
I see a flashlight.

650
00:34:07,874 --> 00:34:09,505
Don't touch me, Shawn.

651
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,972
<i>Wait, what does
"Rocinante" mean to you?</i>

652
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:22,267
<i>No, it was the name of their airplane.
Flew off into the lightning storm.</i>

653
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:24,144
Dude, I solved it.

654
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,229
- Will you be quiet?
- But I solved it!

655
00:34:26,354 --> 00:34:29,191
- Be quiet!
- Wait, I heard it again. Didn't you?

656
00:34:29,828 --> 00:34:31,225
What do you hear?

657
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:33,185
- Birds.
- Listen, listen!

658
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:36,115
Untie, push off.
Please, we're going.

659
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:41,237
I think that's the engine.

660
00:34:41,362 --> 00:34:43,190
I'm gonna kill you, Shawn.

661
00:34:44,378 --> 00:34:46,232
I think they're gone.
I'm gonna call for help.

662
00:34:46,357 --> 00:34:48,184
No, he will hear you.
He has eagle ears.

663
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:49,872
- Eagle ears?
- Yes.

664
00:34:49,997 --> 00:34:51,263
How 'bout I send a text?

665
00:34:51,388 --> 00:34:53,465
- Mute your keys.
- How do I do that?

666
00:34:54,515 --> 00:34:56,087
- Come here.
- What, what?

667
00:34:56,212 --> 00:34:58,286
- What's so important?
- I got a text from Shawn.

668
00:34:58,411 --> 00:35:01,348
- And what'd it say?
- That he solved the crime, and...

669
00:35:01,473 --> 00:35:02,473
And what?

670
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,742
He's trapped in the hull
of a smuggler's boat

671
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:06,263
going out to sea.

672
00:35:07,299 --> 00:35:08,814
What do we do with that?

673
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:13,193
- "How... Can... We... Find... "
- Okay, now type the letter "u,"

674
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,738
instead of "y-o-u."
And you don't need that punctuation.

675
00:35:17,102 --> 00:35:19,862
Dude, I really do feel
so Clooney right now.

676
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,110
I am not Jennifer Lopez.

677
00:35:22,346 --> 00:35:25,748
- That was a compliment.
- How is that possibly a compliment?

678
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:28,542
Did you see <i>El Cantante</i>?
She was amazing.

679
00:35:33,346 --> 00:35:35,073
Shabby's transmitter.

680
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:38,691
Hold on.
Get off me, Shawn.

681
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:46,846
- I got another text!
- What does it say?

682
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:49,034
"Turn on Labayda's laptop."

683
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,981
Someone, get it out of evidence.

684
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:54,523
Now, all we do is wait.

685
00:35:56,222 --> 00:35:57,722
Gus, scratch my leg.

686
00:35:59,004 --> 00:36:00,833
- Will you just scratch my leg?
- I'm not...

687
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:04,222
- The elastic on my sock is...
- I'm not scratching your leg, Shawn.

688
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,783
Can you give us a general location
of the boat?

689
00:36:06,908 --> 00:36:08,582
It's a little bit problematic.

690
00:36:09,012 --> 00:36:10,542
I have the coast guard ready.

691
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,621
- Give us the coordinates.
- That's the problem.

692
00:36:12,746 --> 00:36:16,184
We have a very definitive location,
it just doesn't seem to make any sense.

693
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:17,958
How far out are they?

694
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:21,887
First street and main.

695
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:30,735
Juliet wants me to check outside.

696
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,024
You are not doing that.

697
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:34,946
She says we may not be
where we think we are.

698
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:39,306
I trust her, Gus.
I'm gonna do it.

699
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:53,587
Change of plans.

700
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,058
Let's do this, I got the diamonds,

701
00:36:57,183 --> 00:36:59,466
we lose the equipment
as fast as we can...

702
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:02,803
What the hell?

703
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:07,099
Wait a second.
This is not my boat.

704
00:37:07,864 --> 00:37:10,201
My bad!
Gus, I told you.

705
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,414
Our boat is called "just chillin'".
Just chillin'.

706
00:37:14,182 --> 00:37:15,311
Inexcusable.

707
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,526
We're sorry,
and we'll be on our way.

708
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,987
- Sorry you had to be here.
- Apology accepted.

709
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:23,323
Get down.

710
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,610
Down!

711
00:37:27,909 --> 00:37:30,749
Around this way. Come on.
Towards the truck.

712
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:33,486
What the hell's going on?

713
00:37:33,611 --> 00:37:36,586
All right, I'm just gonna be honest,
'cause that's the best policy, right?

714
00:37:36,711 --> 00:37:38,630
- I'm a psychic.
- A psychic?

715
00:37:38,968 --> 00:37:42,260
I know you guys weren't on your way
to Monterey. And you weren't stranded.

716
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,970
You were on a desperate search
for the wreckage of the Rocaninante.

717
00:37:45,095 --> 00:37:48,473
- That was nowhere near close.
- I really hate that you said that.

718
00:37:48,922 --> 00:37:51,351
- Do we shoot them?
- I don't know yet.

719
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,672
I'll tell you what else I know.

720
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:56,106
You found your wreckage
from a plane that everyone

721
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,380
assumed escaped,
but went down in restricted waters,

722
00:37:58,505 --> 00:38:00,485
which is why your booty
was so tough to find.

723
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,059
- You a cop?
- We are not cops.

724
00:38:02,184 --> 00:38:03,920
No, but if I was a cop,
I'd be a bad cop.

725
00:38:04,045 --> 00:38:07,172
That much I know.
Not because I'm tough, or unscrupulous.

726
00:38:07,297 --> 00:38:09,280
Because of lateness.
Just general tardiness.

727
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:11,167
Would you stop moving?

728
00:38:11,292 --> 00:38:12,789
What's the point of this?

729
00:38:12,984 --> 00:38:16,296
Unfortunately,
a sweet sea lion named Shabby

730
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:19,933
was innocently looking for a fish,
or a squid, to eat.

731
00:38:20,058 --> 00:38:21,547
What the hell's the point of this?

732
00:38:21,672 --> 00:38:24,759
The point is,
you saw the signal coming.

733
00:38:24,884 --> 00:38:26,721
<i>I got a hot signal coming.</i>

734
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:28,722
<i>Is it a boat?</i>

735
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,849
<i>No, could be a diver, though.</i>

736
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,355
You thought you'd been had, so...

737
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,689
You fired into the water,
thinking it was a diver.

738
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,400
<i>I got it, whatever it was.</i>

739
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:43,028
But it was a sweet,
innocent sea lion

740
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:45,906
attached to a beeper
by a television host on the sly,

741
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,868
hoping to exploit his story
for a comeback.

742
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,157
And when you tried to pull him
out of the water,

743
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:53,080
he managed to break free. Why?
Because he was a winner.

744
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:56,500
- And a very strong swimmer.
- And a survivor.

745
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,210
That's right. At least...

746
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:01,546
- At least for a couple of hours.
- You're here because of a sea lion?

747
00:39:01,733 --> 00:39:04,466
I'm here for all the sea lions, Jack!
And the fish.

748
00:39:04,668 --> 00:39:07,092
And that stuff that looks like coral,
but moves when you touch it?

749
00:39:07,217 --> 00:39:09,846
- Gus, what am I talking about?
- Sea amenones.

750
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,932
- Sea anemonene...
- Don't do this to yourself.

751
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,489
- Sea anemones?
- Yes!

752
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:16,311
It's too bad you can't do anything
with all that information, isn't it?

753
00:39:17,671 --> 00:39:20,232
Except that Shabby
left a little something behind.

754
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:25,112
And I've been doing something
I like to call "stalling".

755
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,259
And Rutger Hauer calls

756
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,908
- "Schtalling."
- Why?

757
00:39:30,606 --> 00:39:32,911
- Because he's dutch.
- No, why are you stalling?

758
00:39:33,668 --> 00:39:35,098
Because of that.

759
00:39:35,223 --> 00:39:37,416
Put it down! Don't move!

760
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:38,485
Drop it!

761
00:39:42,552 --> 00:39:44,089
Saving your ass again, Spencer?

762
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:49,011
You'll find that whatever your
missing smugglers had is in that truck.

763
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:51,763
Diamonds?
Perhaps in the boat.

764
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:53,825
What are you talking about?

765
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,856
I'm helping you.
I told you, it's a two-way street.

766
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:59,366
- Hold on, how did you...
- Little bit of this...

767
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,024
And a whole lot of that.

768
00:40:14,173 --> 00:40:15,037
The case

769
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:18,174
is finished, but I still have
to do a little, uh, paperwork.

770
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:19,797
That's all I'm doing here.

771
00:40:19,922 --> 00:40:22,002
But look at you. Look at you!

772
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,254
Yeah, first day back.

773
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:26,631
They even offered me
Labayda's office.

774
00:40:27,547 --> 00:40:29,426
- I said "no".
- Really?

775
00:40:30,235 --> 00:40:33,305
That's the worst decision
anyone's ever made.

776
00:40:34,796 --> 00:40:37,309
Listen, Shawn, I asked them for you,

777
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:41,104
but they don't really allow people
to ride dolphins.

778
00:40:41,595 --> 00:40:43,273
But we could arrange an interaction.

779
00:40:43,736 --> 00:40:45,303
That would be easy.

780
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:49,696
No, no, that's okay.
I'm gonna wait.

781
00:40:50,422 --> 00:40:53,658
Wait until it's natural,
organic, happens in the wild.

782
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,787
- That's illegal.
- What if I ride a whale?

783
00:40:57,643 --> 00:41:00,540
I mean, what if I do the same thing,
but with a whale?

784
00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:03,574
- That's a joke.
- Of course it is.

785
00:41:04,427 --> 00:41:05,420
Yeah, ding.

786
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:08,423
Well, listen,
anything else I can do, please.

787
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,010
- You really are amazing.
- How about dinner? You and me?

788
00:41:12,656 --> 00:41:14,748
A very dark restaurant.
I'll bring some candles,

789
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:17,808
in case it's too dark.
That's something I like to do.

790
00:41:18,022 --> 00:41:19,710
Listen, Shawn...

791
00:41:21,922 --> 00:41:24,170
- I really would love to.
- Sweet.

792
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,858
But, I don't wanna get in the way.

793
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:30,403
- Get in the way?
- Yeah, I like her.

794
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:33,490
And I think you two will get there.

795
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,802
So, thanks for everything.

796
00:41:40,189 --> 00:41:43,084
- What does that even mean?
- Good luck, Shawn.
