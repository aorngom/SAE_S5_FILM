1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,400
Can i get you guys anything else
before i ???

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,000
As a matter
of fact, you can.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,700
My partner,
trapeezius milkington,

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,600
Would like to see something
in a belgian waffle.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,000
Shawn, it's 12:30.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,800
I do not want waffles,
or eggs, or malt-O-Meal.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,600
All right.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,600
What would
you recommend?

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,400
Oh, my gosh.

10
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,700
If you're going to do this,
i'm going to the bathroom.

11
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,200
Excuse me.

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,400
Don't mind him.

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,200
His bladder is
probably smaller than yours.

14
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,400
Now, go ahead.

15
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,000
And take my taste buds
on a fantastical journey.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,900
I don't know.
Um, i like the burgers.

17
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,700
'M sorry.
I should hav you.

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,000
Only rule,ly
it can't be something

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,400
That someone would order
for lunch.

20
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,500
Keep in mind,
we want to go off script here.

21
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,200
Okay, i see.
Well, in that case,

22
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,300
I would recommend
the pumpkin pancakes

23
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,900
With a side of lingcod.

24
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,000
-Does that work?
-Let's get married.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You don't even know me.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,200
Oh, really? Allow me
to introduce yourself...

27
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,500
Jetta girl.

28
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,300
Maybe green,

29
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,100
Backseat loaded
with empty pinkberry cups.

30
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,300
Oh, my god!
Wrong.

31
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,900
I drive a jeep.
A black jeep.

32
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,500
But you're dead on
with the pinkberry.

33
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,400
So what do you think, should
we save a date, or what?

34
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Mm.

35
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,300
I'll think about it.

36
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,200
-Fair enough.
-Okay.

37
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,600
Let me guess.

38
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,900
She's considering
your pposal of marriage.

39
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,200
How could you
possibly know that?

40
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,000
Shawn, you use
that same tight-Ass routine

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,600
On every other waitress
that serves us.

42
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,200
That is
categorically untrue.

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,100
You used it on a eighty-Year-Old
"fixins" attendant at fuddruckers.

44
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,000
What's your point, man?

45
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,700
My point is, you're going to be
eighty-Years-Old

46
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,900
And still shamelessly
hitting on waitress.

47
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,100
Is that what you want?

48
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,500
-Is that a trick question?
-What do you think?

49
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,000
All right, hitch.

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,900
You want me to take a chance?
Huh?

51
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,200
You want to see
some will hunting action?

52
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,300
Here we go.

53
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,000
Who you calling?

54
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Juliet?

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,200
That routine is as tired
as the waitress bit.

56
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,400
Wait for it.

57
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,000
* wait for i-I-I-It *

58
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Hello?

59
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,600
Abigail lytar?
Judd nelson.

60
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,100
Shawn, stop playing.
Is that really abigail?

61
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,500
Shawn, is that you?

62
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,000
Of course it is.
Don't be ridiculous.

63
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,200
Look, clearly we left some loose
ends at our high school  sunoon.

64
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,000
So i was thinking...

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,900
That maybe
we should get together.

66
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,700
Why on earth would you think
that's a good idea?

67
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,400
Oh, i don't know.

68
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,600
The last time i saw you,
we kissed for, like, 27 seconds.

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,400
Gord...

70
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,900
So just us?

71
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,100
Sitting ate ble?

72
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,700
Hofully a corner booth.

73
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,100
Abigail...

74
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,800
What's happening here is, uh...

75
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,300
I'm asking you out
on a proper date.

76
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,800
Shawn, are you sure?

77
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
Are you sure about this?

78
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,400
Yes, i believe i am.

79
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,900
?? Seven.

80
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,500
I'll be the one flaring
my nostrils uncontrollably.

81
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,900
Oh, god, no.

82
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,100
Done.

83
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,100
How do you lik
them apples?

84
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,700
I sincerely hope you didn't
just do that to prove a point.

85
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,000
She's a real person, shawn.
That's no atke.

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,300
She misses me already.

87
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,800
Oh... chief.

88
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,000
Get down here now.
I'm not asking.

89
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,300
That was weird.

90
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,500
We received the following
letter about an hour ago.

91
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,700
It has been authenticated.
It's from the yin yang killer.

92
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,800
Pay close attention.

93
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,700
"Hey everybody, i'm back.
For one night only.

94
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,900
"I'm going to kill someone tonight.

95
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,100
"Guess who, guess where,
guess how.

96
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,900
This is going to be so much fun."

97
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,200
Signed, "mr. Yang."

98
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,100
He's looking
for a new challenger.

99
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,100
That's what he does.

100
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,800
Chief, i believe
he's speaking to me.

101
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,000
Trust me.
I am ready.

102
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,300
Oh, come on, people.

103
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,100
He could be talking
about anybody.

104
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,500
Just last week,

105
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Officer yankowitz
guessed my favorite variety

106
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Of snack crackck tuscan wheatan

107
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,200
It's really obscure.

108
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:15,600
<Font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.Com presents</font>

<Font color="#ffff00">capture:frm@zx
sync:frs@Â±±Áˇ≥/Â∞èËç∏Ëç†</font>

110
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,500
Psych s03 ep16

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,700
What do we have
on his description?

112
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,500
We don't.

113
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,100
We've never had any age, ethnicity,
or physical description.

114
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,500
The harsh truth is is that
this is his game.

115
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,300
And we just have to play along
with him.

116
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,300
That's a terrific plan.

117
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,900
Especially since it's worked out
so well in the past.

118
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,600
Chief...

119
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,400
-The mayor's on the phone.
-Oh, here we go.

120
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,200
Detective lassiter,
introduce shawn to our point person.

121
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,100
-Spencer, listen up.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

122
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,800
I'm getting--
I'm getting something already.

123
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,700
What?
What is it?

124
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,700
I can see the killer.

125
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,500
-Already?
-Yes.

126
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,700
And i know exactly where he is.

127
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,300
Right there.

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,100
Come on, that's our guy.

129
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,700
Shawn.

130
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,100
Shawn,
that is mary lightly,

131
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,100
Our profiler
from the serial homicide

132
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,200
And abduction task force.

133
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,400
He is very familiar
with the patterns of our killer.

134
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,600
And how to make an attractive lamp
out of human skin.

135
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,700
Shawn, play nice.
He's a genius.

136
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,300
And we need him.

137
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,300
Mary...

138
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,900
-This is...
-Shawn spencer.

139
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,200
In the flesh.

140
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,700
See?
He said "flesh."

141
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
You know him?
I've done my research, okay?

142
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,500
Yeah, well,
i've googled myself too,

143
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,400
And there's a lot
of stuff missing.

144
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,600
This is my partner,
sterling cooper.

145
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,900
Hello.

146
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,100
So what's mary short for?
Marian?

147
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,000
No.

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,900
Great, we're all good friends.

149
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,600
Care to shed a little light
on this subject?

150
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Mr. Yang is the most notorious killer
this city has never seen.

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,800
He claimed six victims
in the summer of 1995,

152
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,100
And has resurfaced twice,

153
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,800
Claiming a single victim
each instance.

154
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,700
He only resurfaces when he feels
there is a worthy opponent.

155
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Now, his m.O.

156
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,800
Is to challenge us
with the opportunity

157
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,800
To save the victims
by solving his riddles.

158
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,900
Question.

159
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,300
-Regarding the whole mary thing.
-My father's name was mary.

160
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,900
His father before him
was named mary.

161
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,200
And his father before him
was named craig.

162
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,900
Fair enough.
Proceed.

163
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,800
Yin yang.

164
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,400
The origin of this chinese symbol
is the unity of opposites.

165
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,100
Two opposing, and at the same time,
complementary aspects.

166
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Dark versus light, killer versus cop,
kramer versus kramer.

167
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Just show him the riddle.

168
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,000
"She serves the general well today
whose soldiers wait to die--

169
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
"In a white river they shall pay
for them she will not cry--

170
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,000
Who is she?"

171
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,600
Now, this riddle came
with this stopwatch.

172
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,700
Already running.

173
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,600
One of his classic moves.

174
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,000
You've got one hour
and ten minutes, people.

175
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,100
"Generals and soldiers"--
She'd be in the military.

176
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,700
Mcnabb!

177
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,400
-Yes, sir!
-Damn it.

178
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Want you to contact every military
base in an 80 mile radius.

179
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,300
Find out if any female personnel
have gone awol in the last 48 hours.

180
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,400
Now bear in mind,

181
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,500
It's the psychic
that he wants to play with.

182
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Each riddle will relate
to him personally.

183
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,700
Do you have
any thoughts, shawn?

184
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,500
Yes, jules.
I do.

185
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,900
First of all,

186
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,100
His rhyming skills
are rudimentary at best.

187
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,900
Today, pay, die, and cry?

188
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,600
Come on.
That's bush league.

189
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Yes.

190
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,900
I understand.

191
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,300
Yes.
Thank you, sir.

192
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,900
Karen...

193
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,600
You are not going to use
my son as a pawn.

194
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,800
Oh, i'll advise you
to proceed with caution.

195
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Need i remind you what happened
to the last detective

196
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,600
Who went head-To-Head
with this sick bastard?

197
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
He lost
and an innocent girl died.

198
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,500
Now, i will thank you
to go home and let us do our work.

199
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Not going to happen.
Not going to happen.

200
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,700
Henry!

201
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,000
Your son is the only shot
that we have.

202
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,400
Period.

203
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Yeah, well...
not my problem.

204
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,400
Shawn.

205
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,600
Excuse me.

206
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,800
Hey, did i miss the memo?

207
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,600
I thought "bring your daddy
to work" day was next week.

208
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,400
I forbid you
to be a part of this, shawn.

209
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,200
You're coming with me.

210
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,800
Wh--Wh--Whoa.
Forbid me?

211
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,600
I'm familiar with your hands-On
approach to parenting,

212
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,900
But i'm not 27 anymore
i can do whatever i want.

213
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,000
This guy knows about you,

214
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,300
He knows about everybody
you care about.

215
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,400
Think about that.

216
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,100
You don't catch
the son-Of-A-Bitch, kid,

217
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,200
You're never going
to sleep again.

218
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
Spencer.

219
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,500
???

220
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,900
Go home, dad.
I've got this.

221
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Go home.

222
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,100
Sorry, guys.

223
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,000
?? My zodiac dvd.

224
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,400
??? , please?

225
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,300
"In a white river
they shall pay."

226
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,100
His im washed up
re, maybe there a--

227
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,200
No. There's never
a repeat performance.

228
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,500
Okay, each victim
is a new masterpiece,

229
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,700
And the first riddle
is always a gimme.

230
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,000
No, this guy is itching
to play the game.

231
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,600
Think about the last 24 hours.

232
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,100
Gus.
Gus, i got it!

233
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,300
I-I mean i know
who the general is.

234
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,600
His name is mills.

235
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,500
General mills?
The cereal manufacturer?

236
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,300
Exactly!

237
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,400
The white river is milk,
and the soldiers are cereal.

238
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,300
So who is "she?"

239
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,700
Hi, welcome to captain ron's.
Table for five?

240
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,200
There was a waitress
here earlier.

241
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,500
Long brown hair.

242
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,200
I haven't seen her in a while,
she must be on break.

243
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,800
-Where?
-In the back. By the lockers.

244
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,100
-How do you know this girl?
-We don't really know her.

245
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,100
She served us our lunch.

246
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,200
"All right, shawn.
So close.

247
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
"Too bad she has to die.

248
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,000
"But how? And when
and where?

249
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,700
Don't bother asking why."

250
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
Oh, he still owes us
a riddle.

251
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,300
This is just the amuse-Bouche.

252
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,300
He's taunting you.

253
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,700
I believe he's using the alphabits
to send a message.

254
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,600
That he, too,
believes that breakfast

255
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,900
For lunch
is way underrated.

256
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,200
Would anyone like to try to
write this message with a burrito?

257
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Open challenge.
Take a shot.

258
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,000
Exactly.
I rest my case.

259
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
And now
i want a burrito.

260
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,000
Can i talk to you
for a second, please?

261
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,200
-Dude, what are you doing?
-What are you talking about?

262
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
A girl's life is at stake,
and you're acting like an ass?

263
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Making jokes?

264
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
You haven't taken this thing
seriously from jump street.

265
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,500
-Exactly.
-Exactly?!

266
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,700
'Cause i have to work
like this, okay?

267
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,800
If that guy gets
in my head, we lose.

268
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,100
I have to do my thing.
I cannot show weakness.

269
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,300
And my fanciful rhetoric
helps diffuse a situation

270
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,500
That's very tense
for the group.

271
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,200
But, shawn,
nobody is laughing.

272
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,500
Trust me, they're laughing
on the inside.

273
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,000
Th how it works,
buy.

274
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,300
I need you  help me out here.
Do you thinkouu can d

275
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,500
-I'll try.
-All right.

276
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,500
???

277
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
?? Run,
we'll have more fun.

278
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,300
???

279
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,800
-Next location.
-How much time do we have?

280
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
17 minutes.

281
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,900
Wow.

282
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,500
I want pancakes.
Who wants some pancakes?

283
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,800
Whipped butter, maple syrup,
what?

284
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,600
"Make sure you beat the throw"
insinuates a close play.

285
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,900
You got to touch
home plate.

286
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,900
You got to touch home plate
to score a run.

287
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
That means the clue's back
at the police station.

288
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,100
Make a hole.

289
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Mom?

290
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,700
Hey, goose.

291
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,300
-Hi, mrs. Spencer.
-Hey.

292
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,500
Spencer?
Let's go.

293
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,100
We need to talk.
I'll make it quick.

294
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,500
Sure, no problem.
Find the clue.

295
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
I'll be right there!

296
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,700
-Bye.
-Bye.

297
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,400
I'm not going to mince words.
Your father called me.

298
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,500
He's worried about you.

299
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,600
He wants me to convince you
not to do this.

300
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,300
So he calls you,
you hop on a plane,

301
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,600
-That's how it works, huh?
-No, shawn. I didn't fly down here.

302
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,100
I was at a conference
in ventura.

303
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,700
You're in town?
Would've been nice to know.

304
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,600
The truth is, i'm worried
t u too.

305
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,400
I did psych evals
of several officers

306
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,000
Who were involved in the first round
of this maniac's game.

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,500
It wasn't pretty.

308
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,700
All right, look.

309
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,300
First of all, mom...

310
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,200
I have a date tonight.
All right?

311
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,800
So i have to wrap this up
at a reasonable hour.

312
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,100
And secondly...

313
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,000
This guy has never gone up
against me.

314
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,400
If i can stand here
and tell you

315
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,800
That i will nail this guy, are you
really going to tell me to walk away?

316
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
-Shawn.
-Mom.

317
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,400
I can beat him.

318
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,900
I will...

319
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,100
Beat him.

320
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,700
Okay, goose.

321
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,900
Nail the son-Of-A-Bitch.

322
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,800
Okay, i got to go, mom.

323
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,400
Please be right.

324
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,900
-Spencer, conference room.
-Thanks.

325
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, someone must've signed
for this.

326
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,200
It wasn't delivered.
Dobson found it outside the file room.

327
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,700
How in the hell can--

328
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay, you know what,
people?

329
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,300
Eyes open.

330
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,400
Chief, lou sardocki from the s
phone.

331
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,700
?? You owe him
a statent.

332
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,900
Ah, i'll give him statemen

333
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
That's very clever.

334
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,200
"Meet my little buddy ben.

335
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,000
"Pitter patter is your hint.

336
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,700
"If you can't remember when,

337
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,800
Just read the fine print."

338
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,500
We have
less than one hour.

339
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,700
Shawn, can you...

340
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,900
Speak to it?

341
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,400
No, he
can't speak to it.

342
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Yes, he can.

343
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,200
Just--Just give him
some room, back up.

344
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,800
Fine, knock yourself out,
doctor doolittle.

345
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Doctor doolittle?

346
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,700
I know you can do
better than that, lassie.La

347
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,200
I know you can.

348
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,700
I don't--I don't know
what i'm supposed to remember.

349
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,500
Hey, everybody,
guess who i am.

350
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,100
Hee-Hee.

351
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,300
I'm michael jackson.

352

King of pop?

353
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,200
Shawn, i don't think
this is working.

354
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,300
Are you kidding me?

355
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,800
That was a home run.
Keep up the good work.

356
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,100
"Pitter patter"
is the hint.

357
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,200
Now, i don't think
we're speaking to the mouse.

358
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,600
I think the mouse
is speaking toak.

359
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
What d'you got, shawn?

360
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Fine print.

361
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,300
Hello, my friend.

362
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,600
It's the fine print.

363
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,500
As walking on it.

364
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600

How do you know that?

370
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200
I told you,
i did my research.

371
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,200
And finding uchard's treasure
was extremely impressive.

372
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,400

-My pleasure.

He's calling me "sna"

376
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,900
Ferroequinologist?

377
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,400
A ferroequinologist
is a train enthusiast.

378
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,500
How do you know that?

379
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,400
Because i'm a ferroequinologist.

The tender is a small fuel car

And black snake is slang
for coal train.

384

It's not going to stop.

391
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,900
This is just
a pull through station.

Come on, gus.
This is our fantasy, man.

396
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,900
It's like we're hobos.

397
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,700
I don't have
a hobo fantasy, shawn!

398
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,400
Abigail,
you called me back.

399
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,700
Yes, you left me
very specific instructions

400
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,400
In your message to do so.

401
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
-Is this a bad time?
-No, i can talk.

402
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,000
Look, we're still
totally on for tonight.

403
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,400
I might just have to push
the time a little bit.

404
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,700
Uh-Huh.

405
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,900
Let me guess, you're chasing
a serial killer or something.

406
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,600
Holy crap, yes.

407
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,200
Yes, that's actly
what i'm doing.

408
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,900
How did you--

409
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,400
I cannot believe that you
are bailing on me again.

410
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,200
Hold on.

411
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,300
Tell abigail
what we're doing.

412
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,600
Hello, abigail.
It's gus.

413
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,500
We're chasing a train
like hobos.

414
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,300
What?

415
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,600
She wants
to talk with you.

416
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,600
First of all,  his
"out-Of-Breath voice" is terrible.

417
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,300
He was bad in othello senior year,
he's bad now.

418
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,500
Look, i'm just--I'm flashing
back to high school.

419
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,300
And i have this image
of me standing alone

420
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,000
On a pier
looking like an idiot.

421
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,200
I swear
i'm telling the truth.

422
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm going
to have to call you back.

423
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,800
By the way, you were beautiful
on that pier.

424
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,900
"A moving picture

425

What do you see?

433
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,400
Nothing...

434
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,000
I don't see anything.
Not yet.

435
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,700
Oh, wait, i do see something.

436
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,800
What?
What is it?

437
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,100
I think you're going to want
to see this.

438
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,500
It's pretty good.

439
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,900
Let me on.

440
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,600
Mary, i'm surprised
it took you so long.

441
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,900
You seem so spry.

442
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,700
Ankle weights.

443
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,400
I always wear them,
even when i sleep.

444
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,900

How can i help?

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,400

You got to be kidding me.

450
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,900
I got it.
I-I solved it.

451
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,400

Answer it!

-Shawn, what are you doing?
-No, don't you see?

456
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,200
It didn't start ringing
until we were three feet away.

457
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,400
Answer the phone, spencer.

458
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,600
He's watching us,
right now, from somewhere.

459
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,700
Answer the phone, shawn.

460
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,800
If that girl dies,
you're an accessory to murder.

461
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,700
Shawn, i hope to god
you know what you're doing.

462
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,700
Unbelievable.

463
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,100
He's been here.

464
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,600
He was here watching us the whole time!

465
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,800
Don't touch anything.

466
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,000
Let's get csi down here to dust for prints.

467
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,100
No need...

468
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,900
I'm sure he touched things.
He probably touched everything.

469
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,300
But you're not going to find any prints.

470
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,700
He's too good for that.

471
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,100
What is this sick, twisted admiration
you have for this whack job?

472
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,900
<i>Now do you get how good he is?</i>

473
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,700
This puppy's just warming up.

474
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,000
Hey, everybody, check it out.

475
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,700
See how big i am compared to this plane.

476
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,900
I'm king kong.

477
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,600
Guster, what the hell is going on with you?

478
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,800
Seriously, man, i need you
to pull yourself together.

479
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,400
Oh, my god.

480
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,500
I got it.

481
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,400
<i>It's a message.</i>

482
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,600
He says... you are a naughty, naughty boy.

483
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,700
But he's giving us another chance.
She's still alive.

484
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,400
Let's go back to the station,
wait for instructions.

485
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,700
Forget that, i'm not going.

486
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,200
<i>- What do you mean?
- I'm nobody's puppet.</i>

487
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,100
Okay?

488
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,500
I'm done--I'm done playing his little games.

489
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
I solved his puzzles, i talked to a rat,

490
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
I even chased a train. I'm--I'm finished.

491
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,900
But no one's ever gotten this far,
that's why he's still playing.

492
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
It's a sign of respect.

493
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,900
No, it isn't, mary.

494
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,800
You said it, man,

495
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
With your fey name and
your weird ken burns haircut.

496
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,200
He's too good.

497
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,300
Isn't that right? He's better than me.

498
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,500
<i>We never had a chance.</i>

499
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,300
He's going to kill that girl either way.

500
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,300
<i>Maybe. Maybe not, shawn.</i>

501
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,100
But i know this, you don't just give up.

502
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,100
Tell you what, jules. Uh,
the next time a serial killer

503
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,800
Calls you out, personally,

504
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,600
<i>Uh, you can pick up your little pom-Poms,</i>

505
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,500
And you can rally the troops
to never say "die." I'm out.

506
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,600
Now get out.

507
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,200
<i>All three of you.</i>

508
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,300
- I can't believe i'm hearing this.
- Should i say it again?!

509
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,100
Screw you, spencer. We don't need you.

510
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,500
We don't need him, o'hara.

511
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
We will find this sicko
on our own, come on.

512
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,800
We're running out of time.

513
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,800
Look... shawn.

514
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,900
I know you're upset.

515
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,000
- But if we give up now--
- Gus. Don't be the last of

516
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,800
The famous international playboys.
We're not giving up, okay. Far from it.

517
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,000
The only--Only chance we have to win the game
at this point is to change the rules, okay?

518
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,500
I took a risk out there
because i knew he wouldn't kill her.

519
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,000
I knew he wouldn't kill her
because he loves the game too much.

520
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,900
But that bought us time--
It bought us time to work by ourselves.

521
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,200
Okay, we're going--We're going
to drop off his radar,

522
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,100
We're still going to find the girl.

523
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,700
We're going to do it on our own.
That's our move.

524
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,100
All right, but where do we start?

525
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,100
We're gonna go e ginning. ???

526
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,300
Like what i did dwith the king kong?

527
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,300
You're on fire. You're even using props.

528
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,900
Just got this fax.
Traced it to a bogus 800 number.

529
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,600
"I'm no doubting thomas.
I pucker up to fights.

530
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,200
Were you to shake my hand,
you'd have to use your right.

531
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,000
Who am i?"

532
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, if yang was watching,
he could know spencer flew the coop.

533
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,100
This could be directed at any one of us.

534
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,200
Probably not this guy.

535
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,000
It's me.

536
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,400
It's directed at me.
He must know i'm a civil war buff.

537
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,100
??? Confederate geer
omas stonewall jackson,

538
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,600
Shot and killed by his own troops
at the battle of chancellorsville.

539
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,400
<i>He was known for sucking on lemons,
even durin ???</i>

540
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,300
And while he is buried
in lexington, virginia,

541
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,600
His left arm is buried separately
near the battlefield.

542
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Hey, you guys remember that pat
swayze miniseries, north and south?

543
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,800
Talk about civil war buff, huh?

544
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,500
Oh, my god... the stonewall
hotel and suites.

545
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,500
Probably room 1863.

546
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,100
We've got to get down there.
And you can count me in

547
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,600
For next year's reenactment, partner.

548
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,500
Copy that. Get my jacket.

549
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,700
Look, call me back, okay?
We're still on for tonight.

550
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,900
Gus and i are making
some serious progress here.

551
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,300
Call me back.

552
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,500
Straight to voicemail.
That's not a good sign.

553
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,200
Uh, wrong. I drive a jeep.

554
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,400
A black jeep.

555
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,500
Gus, there's no jeep.

556
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,300
I think he drove away in her car.

557
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,900
We find the car, we may find the girl.

558
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,000
Lassie, hold on.

559
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,800
Find the girl's car.
It's a black jeep.

560
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,600
We already did.
You got to get down here.

561
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,500
Where are you?

562
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,600
???

563
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
???

564
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,300
She's breathing.

565
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,400
I'll get the paramedics.

566
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,600
"Shawn no longer wants to pla
kes too low to make you stay."

567
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,200
He's--He's got her.

568
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,700
Gus.

569
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,500
He's got my mom.

570
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,700
??? Over to abigail lytar's apartment.

571
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,700
Now, she's fine.

572
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,100
<i>But i'm posting them on a watch
until we can figure out what is going on.</i>

573
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,700
<i>Spencer, you need to get in here.</i>

574
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,300
"You should be moving,
as most people do.

575
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,200
<i>But instead you sit,
and enjoy the vu.</i>

576
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,000
P.S. Mommy says, "hi."
And "bye."

577
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,000
Just in case."

578
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,000
<i>V.U.</i>

579
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,400
Why'd he spe way?

580
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,300
Maybe that'she hint.

581
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,600
Or maybe he ran out of lipstick.

582
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,100
Brendan vu.

583
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,700
From the spelling bee.

584
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,800
Od g ss.

585
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,900
But it's a misdirect.

586
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,500
I know exactly what he wants me to watch.

587
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
You do?

588
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,300
Morning, mr. Malone. Morning.

589
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,600
<i>I want ten pounds of kumquats,
have 'em done in a hurry.</i>

590
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,300
This is  a needle in a haystack...

591
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,000
Made completely out of needles.

592
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,700
Looks like we're at the end game.

593
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,500
All right, we know
he used the waitress' car.

594
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
- So there's a good chance it's--
- It's definitely a chance

595
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,400
What kind of car does your wife drive?

596
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,900
She rents when she's down here.

597
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,000
Do you know what company she rents from?

598
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,900
<i>That can narrow it down to a few models.</i>

599
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,200
It's blue. It's blue, gus.

600
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,100
We're looking for a blue car. It's a sedan.

601
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
People, we're looking
for a blue car. A sedan.

602
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,200
All right, split up.
S.W.A.T., cover the exits.

603
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,900
<i>Hey, man,
watch where you're going.</i>

604
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,300
What'd you say?

605
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,000
Hey, ma.

606
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,900
- ???
- Shhh-Hh-Hh. Dad t down, get down.

607
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,300
Oh, shit.

608
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,200
Mom, i'm going to take this off, okay?

609
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,300
- Mm.
- It's okay.

610
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,700
- Ah.
- It's just a decoy.

611
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,300
I know. I see that.

612
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,200
He's fine. He's breathing.
Yang must've knocked him out.

613
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,500
S.W.A.T. Call for a medic.

614
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,500
Yes, ma'am.

615
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
Oh, my god.

616
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,900
Dad, she's strapped.

617
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,200
Oh, god, no!

618
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,700
??? Where is he?

619
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,700
Maddy...

620
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Henry?

621
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,400
Yeah, it's me, sweetheart.

622
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,100
I'm right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

623
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,600
All right. Then i won't either.

624
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,700
Besides, i don't really have
anything better to do right now.

625
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,400
It's just a pen. It's just a pen.

626
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,600
What does this mean, mary?

627
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,900
- Tell us!
- I don't know.

628
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,600
This feels more like improvisation.

629
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,300
<i>This isn't his game.</i>

630
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,900
We got here in time,
maybe we won.

631
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,000
No, he's definitely going
to kill her dead.

632
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,100
<i>I just don't know how.</i>

633
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,200
He's been one step ahead
this whole time.

634
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,300
Where's shawn?

635
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,200
Hopefully one step ahead of us.

636
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,700
All right, be honest with me.

637
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,200
You're surprised, right?

638
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,400
I'm prettier than you'd thought i'd be.

639
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,000
It's the bone structure.

640
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,700
I won.

641
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,200
I beat you,
that was the deal.

642
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Let my mom go.

643
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,700
You are just amazing.

644
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,500
<i>My most--
Most admirable foe.</i>

645
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,100
But then, see,
i knew you would be.

646
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,900
That's why i chose you.

647
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,300
Because i'm--I'm your yin.

648
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,700
<i>Oh, that's sweet.
Thank you for that.</i>

649
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,000
But you're completely surrounded.

650
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,500
<i>There's no way out of this for you.</i>

651
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,400
Now you know what i love
about this movie, shawn?

652
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
<i>Its great resolution.</i>

653
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,700
Okay, so call me old-Fashioned, but really.

654
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,400
Is there anything more
satisfying than a solid ending?

655
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,000
<i>You call me a killer.</i>

656
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,800
But the truth is...

657
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,500
I complete things.

658
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,900
<i>And that is what people really want.</i>

659
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,700
<i>To feel complete.</i>

660
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,400
That, and a corner booth.

661
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,100
And now...

662
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:41,000
Our story that we created so
beautifully together is going to end.

663
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,400
<i>But how?</i>

664
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,400
Do you want to know what it is?

665
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,100
Or do you want to be surprised?

666
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,000
???

667
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,500
Stand down! Stand down!

668
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,700
Stand down! Stand down!

669
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,900
Let me guess.

670
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,000
You want to die. Right?

671
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,700
That's the perfect resolution.

672
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,700
Gee, that's original.
You're a cliche.

673
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,300
You're a knock-Off
of a knock-Off.

674
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,000
I could've killed your
mom hours ago, shawn.

675
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,300
This switch has such a light touch,
like pinching a baby's cheek.

676
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,700
And then boo!

677
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,100
She blows up.

678
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,600
How much fun would that be to see?

679
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,500
Ugh, it gives me shivers.
I want to do that so badly!

680
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,700
But then you wouldn't like me, shawn.

681
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,700
And i want you to like me.

682
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,100
<i>Oh, god, i'm so torn.</i>

683
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,500
I need you to like me.

684
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,000
Because we're going to be
working together again.

685
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,600
Ah, no, no, no, no.

686
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,400
You're going to rot in a cell
with four padded walls. The end.

687
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,800
No. The end of the beginning.

688
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,700
I'm going to write a book.

689
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,100
Our story.

690
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,900
It's going to be epic,
a best-Seller. And guess what?

691
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,700
I want you to write the foreword.

692
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,700
Pass.

693
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,500
Okay.

694
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,700
But think about it...

695
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,900
On your date tonight.

696
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,000
Clear!

697
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,100
<i>??? Go! Go!</i>

698
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,700
Okay, all right. You're okay.

699
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,500
Think about it on your date tonight.

700
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,700
She was there.

701
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,700
- Gus, she was there the whole time.
- You got her, shawn.

702
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,500
End of story.

703
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,100
Congratulations, spencer.

704
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,000
Don't be too excited there, mary.

705
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,900
It's not like we just apprehended santa
barbara's most notorious killer or anything.

706
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,800
You're right, gus.
I'm sorry to fly off the handle.

707
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,400
I've spent the last 13 years
of my life with this person.

708
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,300
Guess i have to find a new hobby.

709
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
Two words:

710
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,500
Racquetball.

711
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
That could work.

712
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,200
Thanks for your help, man.

713
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,500
I needed it.

714
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,800
- Gus, you play racquetball?
- Good-Bye, mary.

715
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,800
Till next time.

716
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
There we go.

717
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
Henry. I told him to go for it.

718
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,400
That doesn't matter.

719
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,800
What matters is
that you're both okay.

720
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,200
You two oe the most important people
in the world to me, you know.

721
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,400
??? Know.

722
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,700
<i>Mom.</i>

723
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,100
<i>Let's get you outta here.
What do you need? What can i do?</i>

724
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,800
Let's see, you already got me
kidnapped by a raging sociopath.

725
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,200
Right, check. What else?

726
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
Nothing. Nothing, goose.
I'm--I'm really fine.

727
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
Your father's been taking
very good care of me.

728
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,000
If i'm not mistaken...

729
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,900
You have a very important date tonight.

730
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,900
Oh, mom, please.

731
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,900
I can reschedule.

732
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,400
No, you won't.

733
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,800
I'm fine.

734
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,100
That crazy bitch snuck up from
behind me with chloroform.

735
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,700
Life is more than catching bad guys.

736
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,100
You did a good deed today.

737
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,100
Now it's time to go see about a girl.

738
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,400
It's time to go see about a girl.

739
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,700
How do you like them apples?

740
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,100
Mm.

741
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,800
- Well played,
- Mom. All right.

742
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
Hey.

743
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,500
Shawn, did you rlly just catch mr. Ya

744
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,900
Yes, i did. And he turned t to be a she.

745
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,600
- Curious.
- Yeah.

746
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,300
Hey, i'm sorry i didn't believe you earlier.

747
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,700
I just... really didn't.

748
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,700
Half apology accepted.

749
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,100
- Mm.
- Uh...

750
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,700
I cut a deal with the theatre manager.

751
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,700
So this is still happening in a big, big way.

752
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,200
How do you feel about popped corn?

753
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,200
I like it. I like it very much.

754
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,300
<i>Jules.What're you doing here?</i>

755
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,200
What i mean is, you know,

756
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,500
Who--Who's going to fit mr. Yang
with her straightjacket

757
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,700
And iron mask with face grill?

758
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,500
Something tells me there's an entire precinct
of officers bidding on that job right now.

759
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,500
Uh...

760
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,400
Can i interest you in a necco wafer?

761
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,000
Shawn, can you just not
talk for a few seconds?

762
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,100
<i>Look...</i>

763
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,400
I just wanted to tell you
that what you did today...

764
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,200
<i>I mean...</i>

765
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,200
I can't imagine being able to function
at that level while your mom was...

766
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,300
<i>You know--</i>

767
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
I am, uh...clearly

768
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,000
<i>Not as good with words as you are.</i>

769
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,500
And, um...

770
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,600
I know that things between us have been

771
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,200
A little complicated.

772
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,900
And there have probably been some
mixed signals, mostly from me.

773
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,100
With regards to the time that we spend
together outside of the line of duty...

774
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,000
- Look, jules--
- Shh!

775
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,300
Just please let me finish stumbling
through this. I'm almost done, i promise.

776
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
What i'm saying...

777
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,700
Is that i think maybe

778
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,700
The best things,
the richest things,

779
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,300
Aren't supposed to come easily.

780
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,700
And that sometimes the moments
that make the most sense

781
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,000
Happen when everything else doesn't.

782
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,600
And, well...

783
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,300
I think you deserve
more than popcorn tonight.

784
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,400
So w't you let me
take you to dinner?

785
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,700
Youyot on a dat ???

786
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Am.

787
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,200
- Oper ???
- Wow.

788
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,600
I cannot believe this.

789
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,900
All this time, and...

790
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,200
Your timing is just awful.

791
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,600
- It is?
- Yeah.

792
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,000
It's just dreadful.

793
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,700
What?

794
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,800
I can't go to dinner
with you, jules.

795
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm already on a date.

796
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You are?

797
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,700
- What, here?
- Yeah, right now.

798
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,700
It's weird--
It's a little weird.

799
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,000
But, uh...

800
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Yeah. With abigail.

801
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,700
The one that got away.

802
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,100
Yeah.

803
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,300
Get out there.

804
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,800
She's not going to wait forever.

805
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Jules.

806
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,600
I'm so sorry...

807
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,800
For snapping at you earlier.

808
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,500
I know.

809
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,400
- You all right?
- Yeah. Why would you even ask that?

810
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,200
Mostly because you look like you got punched

811
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,800
In the stomach and stopped
breathing for a few seconds.

812
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,800
Wow.

813
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,900
I didn't realize
i was that transparent.

814
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,900
The truth-- The truth is,
abigail, everything's not okay.

815
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,700
I don't know exactly how to--
How to say this.

816
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,000
Try using words to form a sentence.

817
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,600
I'm so, so sorry, abigail.

818
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,400
They're all out of butter.

819
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,000
- Wait, what?
- I know, i'm sorry.

820
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,700
I'm sorry, i don't know
why i'm apologizing,

821
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,300
'Cause it's not my fault, really.

822
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,000
But, i mean, it's opening night.

823
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,300
And how do you run out of butter?

824
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,000
That's cardinal.
That's cardinal.

825
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,300
<i>- What are we going to do?
- I don't know, exactly.</i>

826
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,500
Uh...

827
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,800
As you can see, the kernels are
fluffy and salted quite nicely.

828
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,900
I tried--I tried one.

829
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,400
But we do have, uh, necco wafers.

830
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,200
Necco.

831
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,100
- And toblerone.
- I love toblerone.

832
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,600
Yes, i sensed that you might.

833
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,000
It's like a more sophisticated crkle.

834
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,300
Hey,'rhesure about this?

835
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,500
Absolutely.

836
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,600
Now, in with you.

837
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,500
This carriage.

838
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,300
Oh, god!

839
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,500
That's what i'm talking about.

840
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,000
Gus.

841
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,100
Hello, abigail.

842
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,700
The thing is, it's--It's his car.

843
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,200
It's a company car.

844
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,300
And he's very protectof it.
So just pretend like he isn't here.

845
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,000
<i>Are those necco wafers up there?</i>

846
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,600
<i>Yes, they are. Pass them back, please.</i>
