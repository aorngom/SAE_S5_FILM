1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,800
??

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Shawn.

3
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,600
What are you doing
home From school?

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Uh...

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,000
Uh, well...

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,100
At the assembly today,
There was a guy.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,300
And he hypnotized Some students.

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,000
And one of them thought
He was a kangaroo.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,100
And he punched the guy.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,300
And he passed out Before he
could put the kids Back to normal.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,500
Uh, but luckily,

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,100
Mr. Detmer,
An ex-Navy seal,

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,600
Put everyone back Before six
kids had to go To the hospital.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,600
Let me see the suspension
note From the teacher.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,300
How did you know?

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,300
Kid, i got a nickname At work.
It's "the human lie Detector."

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,800
I spend my day Analyzing lies
And the people Who tell them.

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,100
Rule number one.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,600
Every lie is built
On a kernel of truth.

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,800
Take your little fib,
For instance.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,300
If i were to put money On it,

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,300
I'd say the only true thing
That you just said Is that

23
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,000
mr. Detmer Is ex-Navy seal.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,900
You're right.
That's amazing.

25
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,700
Not really.

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,500
The relative specificity Of that statement
Compared to the others Made it obvious.

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,000
Look, shawn,

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,500
If you continue
To lie like this,

29
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,700
Nobody's gonna believe you
When it counts.

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,100
And that could
put your life On the line.

31
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,800
Like maybe
when i Might be a cop?

32
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,200
No. Like now.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,800
Shawn spencer thrives
On clutch moments like this.

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,500
It's just him, the ball,
And the hole,

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,900
Surrounded by silence.

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,500
And a man wearing A
hefty bag on angel dust.

37
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Come on, dude,
I was in the zone!

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Now i have to start All over.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,900
Shawn, the floor is flat.

40
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,400
I don't know why you can't
Just putt in our office.

41
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Because, gus, anyone can hit
A ball into an empty cup.

42
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,200
The true challenge Is to guide
the ball Almost magically

43
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,600
Through the organized
chaos Of human bustle

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,600
And into the hole
As if no one were there.

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,500
Let's just hope it works better

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,700
Than when you attempted The
same thing with the darts.

47
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,000
Pardon me? I nailed that.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,100
30-Foot bull's-Eye.

49
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,000
No. You hit a guy's eye.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,400
Shh.

51
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,700
Dude!

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Stay alive.

53
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Get there.

54
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,100
Oh!

55
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,000
How about my phone call?

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,200
- You'll get Your phone call.
- I didn't do it. You have to believe me.

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,300
Oh!

58
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,800
- Who put a putting green In here?
- He was already dead.

59
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,000
I was trying To
resuscitate him.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,500
Wait, wait, that guy.

61
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,900
The one with the great hair.
He can vouch for me.

62
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,200
I think we worked at busch
Gardens together one summer.

63
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,500
Yeah, we made funnel cakes.

64
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,500
Oh, look at that, gus.

65
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,800
He must've gotten me Confused
With another man With great hair.

66
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
And the white guy.

67
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,100
- I know him too.
- Save it, ryan.

68
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,900
- Hey, rember--
- Just shut up.

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,700
Uh, jules.

70
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,000
- What's the story there?
- Yeah.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,200
That's ryan bainsworth,

72
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,600
Or "lyin' ryan" as
we call him Around here.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,800
He's a compulsive liar Who
is notorious For calling in tips

74
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,300
And sending the department
On wild goose chases.

75
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,100
He's pretty much An
embarrassment to all of us.

76
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,300
How can you tell that
someone's A compulsive liar?

77
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,000
I mean, assuming that
Their pants aren't on fire?

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,500
Trust me. We know.

79
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,700
Oh, come on, jules.

80
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,700
We all tend to bend
the truth Just a little.

81
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,500
Not me.

82
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
- Oh really?
- Mm-Mm.

83
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,700
Does this ring a bell?

84
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,500
No, shawn, i have not had
Any naughty dreams About you.

85
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,500
And...

86
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,700
Yes, shawn,

87
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,600
i do wish Gus was never born
So that i could be Your partner.

88
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
- What?
- True story.

89
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,100
- That's messed up.
- I never said that, gus.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,900
Anyway, Ryan usually comes in
Claiming to be a witness To a crime.

91
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,800
But this time, Looks like
he's committed one.

92
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,200
Oh, detective o'hara,

93
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,100
This is dr. Morey,
The d.A.'S Psychological expert.

94
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,200
Nice to meet you. Here's
the file on our suspect.

95
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Thank you very much.

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't mind them.

97
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,000
They're just here To observe.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,600
She's right.
Please carry on.

99
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,700
But when you're finished,

100
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,700
I'd appreciate If you
evaluate my partner gus.

101
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,100
For years, he's Been claiming
to be insane In the membrane.

102
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,400
All right, why don't you
Just do us all a favor

103
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,500
And write down in neat
Little letters All about

104
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,600
how you stabbed And murdered
your super In cold blood.

105
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,000
For the last time,
I'm innocent.

106
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,200
I had asked my super
To fix the garbage disposal.

107
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,300
I clogged it With cinnamon sticks
And lemon wedges From a marinade.

108
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,000
Afterwards, he Was to check my pipes
Because the polarity Is completely off

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
And the water
Drains counterclockwise.

110
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,000
But by the time I got home,
I found him there...

111
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,900
dead.

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,800
Doctor, if i can speak For you...

113
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,700
I'd rather you didn't.

114
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,900
Look, All things being equal,

115
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,300
I'd rather be
scrapbooking Right now.

116
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,100
But that's--
That's not important.

117
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,400
Though i have been known
To make a kick-Ass collage.

118
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,500
Then maybe you'd like To
tell me who did kill him.

119
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,500
- Yes. An assassin.
- An assassin.

120
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,400
A hired assassin.
No, two of them, actually.

121
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,100
Yes, you see,
That has to be it.

122
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,700
The night before,
I went to this restaurant

123
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,300
To get a basket Of these things Called
fries quatro queso Dos fritos.

124
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,700
You know, the ones Where they inject
potatoes With the four cheese mixture,

125
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,300
Fry them three
quarters Of the way,

126
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,200
Pull them out, batter
them, Fry them again,

127
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,700
And then serve them with bacon
And an ancho chile sour cream.

128
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,900
Anyway,
As i was sitting there,

129
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,900
A car speeds right through
The storefront Across the street.

130
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,800
It makes such a loud noise,
I had to turn my head and look.

131
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,500
And that is when i overheard The
guy with the curly-Q's On his face

132
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,000
Tell the other guy At the corner
table About the assassination plot.

133
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,500
- Can it be true?
- No way.

134
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,000
I mean, I--
Is it even possible?

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,300
I couldn't imagine.

136
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,300
There's no way you could
prepare A fry like that.

137
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,000
That'd be way too much For the--
For the human palate To manage.

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,400
It would be A flavor seizure.

139
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,900
Gentlemen,
Please don't be ridiculous.

140
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
She's right.

141
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,300
Let's just take a minute here
To think things through.

142
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,100
- They must be parboiling The potato first.
- An assassination plot?

143
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,200
Seriously, how gullible
Do you think we are?

144
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,500
You have to believe me.
I'm 100% sure on this.

145
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,400
I clearly heard One of them say

146
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,400
That they were gonna kill
Someone with his belt buckle.

147
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,300
Ryan, come on.

148
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,100
They must've known
That i overheard them.

149
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,900
That's why they
Were trying to kill me.

150
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,900
But they surprised the super
In my apartment, Got him instead.

151
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,200
And-- And he tried To
stop them. They killed him.

152
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,200
How did they know
Where to find you, huh?

153
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,300
Because i was looking For them.

154
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,000
I was asking around,
Putting up fliers.

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,300
Oh, fliers.

156
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,900
Oh, well, that makes sense then.
You advertised for killers.

157
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,500
You have to believe me.

158
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,200
These are the guys
That you want.

159
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,400
If you don't catch them, Someone
else is gonna die. I swear to you.

160
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,000
I have a question.

161
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,200
- No.
- It's not A yes or no question.

162
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,500
What is The name of the restaurant
That serves These alleged fries

163
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,300
And might i substitute
A garlic lemon aioli?

164
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,800
Spencer, out.

165
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,000
Officer,

166
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,500
If it helps any,

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I think substitutions Are allowed.

168
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,900
- So what do you think, Dr. Morey?
- Well,

169
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,600
he shows All the classic signs
Of an underlying pathology.

170
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,600
People like this lie In order
to make Themselves valuable.

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,800
Over time, When people stop
Believing their lies,

172
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,200
They're forced to escalate Their behavior
in order To reclaim The attention.

173
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,300
Could he escalate it
to the point of murder?

174
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,200
- My professional opinion?
- Please.

175
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,300
His police history

176
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,800
And the circumstantial Evidence Of
his fingerprints On the murder weapon

177
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
And the victim's
blood On his hands...

178
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,200
Mm, yes, i think that should
be Enough to prosecute him.

179
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,700
- Well, that's too bad.
- Why?

180
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,100
Because lyin' ryan Is
telling the truth this time.

181
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Well...

182
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:14,300
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com presents</font>

<font color="#ffff00">psych s3 e14</font>

185
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,000
And you're sure you want
To take one the sbpd,

186
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,800
An expert In forensic psychology,
And the d.A.'S office?

187
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,300
Because they all
believe He's guilty.

188
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,100
I certainly Want to
investigate further.

189
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,000
Every good liar's lies
Are rooted in a kernel of truth.

190
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,000
This isn't even our case.

191
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,700
Are you trying to show up
The police department?

192
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,200
Is this about pride?

193
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,400
Gus, i got these
jeans At a garage.

194
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,000
Not a garage sale.
A garage.

195
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Clearly pride is
not an issue For me.

196
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,000
This is about me Not wanting
a man To be wrongfully convicted

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,500
Because he has a sickness
That he cannot control.

198
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,900
Plus, he appreciated my hair.

199
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,900
No, he appreciated my hair.

200
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,900
He was lying.

201
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,700
He's a compulsive liar.
That's what they do.

202
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,200
Come on.
Try to play catch up.

203
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,700
Uh, why don't you play
"Investigate this on your own"?

204
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Fine.

205
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Stay here, wash the dishes
In those ridiculous gloves.

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm going to the restaurant That
he said had cheese-Infused,

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Twice-Battered fries.

208
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,600
I'll drive.

209
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,600
The fries exist, shawn.

210
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,100
He was telling the
truth In a big way.

211
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,500
They're like a pyramid
Of savory goodness.

212
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,700
Let's just sit here And
look at them for awhile.

213
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,800
Dude, this feels like A family
establishment, Doesn't it?

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,700
I'm not sure two ruthless, Hired
gunmen Would frequent A place like...

215
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,000
A car speeds right through The
storefront window Across the street.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,400
That made me turn my head.

217
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
This.

218
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Uh, 'scuse us.

219
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,400
- Uh-Huh.
- Do you rember

220
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,900
If there were two Threatening-Looking guys
Sitting at that table In the corner yesterday?

221
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,900
Oh, my gosh. Yes.

222
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,100
- How'd you know that?
- He's psychic.

223
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,300
Oh. Oh.

224
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,700
- Do you do parties?
- Private ones, yes.

225
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,400
Are you thinking of throwing A
little something together For yourself?

226
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,800
Oh, no, my niece,
She's turning six.

227
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,900
Not available for that.

228
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,000
Uh, do you by chance Remember
overhearing Anything they said?

229
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,400
No, the only thing They said
to me Was when they ordered.

230
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,500
A beer and a cup of hot water
With cinnamon sticks And lemon wedges.

231
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,100
I clogged it With cinnamon sticks
And lemon wedges From a marinade.

232
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,200
But they Were totally creepy.

233
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,900
Scared the heck
Out of the hostess.

234
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,100
Yeah, i saw those guys.

235
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,600
Definitely very creepy.

236
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,800
The one with the weird
Handlebar mustache...

237
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,000
That is when i overheard The guy
With the curly-Q's On his face.

238
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
- Handlebar mustache.
- Like the hamburglar?

239
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,400
No, no, no.
That was mayor mccheese.

240
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,000
He had the 'stache.
'Burglar had the mask.

241
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,700
Right, right, right.

242
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,700
Then there was grimace.
That brother was funny.

243
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,200
- What?
- No, no, no, no. Excuse us.

244
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
- I gave you vin diesel.
- Gave me?

245
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,200
You're not claiming
grimace Is a brother.

246
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,100
Grimace is a brother.

247
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,500
He's an amorphous mass.
He's like a big amoeba.

248
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,400
- He's a black amoeba, Shawn.
- Purple.

249
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,900
Anyway...

250
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,900
When i seated them,

251
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,200
I saw a bulge Under
his suit jacket,

252
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,500
Like, from a gun On his belt.

253
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,600
They were gonna kill someone
With his belt buckle.

254
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,800
I think i'm starting To
understand how ryan works.

255
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,700
When people stop
believing Their lies,

256
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,100
They're forced to escalate Their behavior
In order to reclaim The attention.

257
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,300
Sorry. Anything else?

258
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,000
No. But you guys Should
talk to carl, the valet.

259
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,800
He had a really weird story.

260
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,700
Thank you.

261
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,900
What color was grimace?

262
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,500
- What?
- Black.

263
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,200
Yeah, those creepy dudes.

264
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,200
They were talking a lot
About money or somethin'.

265
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,700
Then one of them slips
The other one a bag of cash.

266
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,400
But then they
give me A $.50 tip.

267
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,700
You know, It really
pisses me off

268
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,000
When folks are too cheap
To even shell out for a dollar.

269
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,500
I hear that.

270
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,300
Take care of yourself.

271
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,600
Mr. Spencer.
Mr. Guster.

272
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,700
What are you Doing here?

273
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,200
- Well, chief, If you must know--
- I must.

274
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,700
We are going to
speak With ryan

275
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,800
Because the psychic
bone In this finger

276
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,200
Is telling me That he is not
lying About the hit men,

277
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Which means he may Also be telling
the truth About the assassination plot.

278
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,000
And if we Don't follow up on it,
Even though it seems Pretty thin,

279
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,000
- Someone could die.
- What?

280
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,700
Ha. I will. I will tell her
that Because it's spot on.

281
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,000
Chief, that is A
very smart pantsuit.

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,100
I'm not having a conversation
With your pinky.

283
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,700
Okay. One last question.

284
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,400
Loehmann's or talbots?

285
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,700
Even if i did believe you,
Which i don't,

286
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,200
I have been down this road
With ryan too many times.

287
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,700
Now, unless you have some
Concrete proof of something,

288
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,300
You and your pinky Are
banned from wasting

289
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,300
Any department resources On any
information Coming from ryan bainsworth.

290
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,400
Fair enough.

291
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,500
We will find you
Something concrete.

292
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you.

293
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,700
Good news, We have
an ingenious plan.

294
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,200
Ingenious.

295
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,600
Huh.

296
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,200
So maybe you'd like to turn
And face another direction--

297
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,000
Preferably away From
ryan's holding cell.

298
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,400
You're not speaking to him.
This is not a case For you.

299
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,100
Go home.

300
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
- Oh. Us.
- Oh.

301
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,100
We should--
We go home.

302
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,200
Thank you.

303
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,800
No, no.
You didn't do anything.

304
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,000
It's not your fault.

305
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,300
His name Was
grimace jackson, shawn.

306
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,700
Grimace t. Jackson.

307
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,500
- You're ridiculous.
- Whatever.

308
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,200
How are we gonna get Into ryan's
apartment To check it out?

309
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Follow my lead.

310
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,000
- Hiya.
- Hello.

311
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,600
May i help you?

312
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,100
Perhaps. My name
Is shawn spencer.

313
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,500
I'm with the big
uncles Of america program.

314
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,700
This is My underprivileged
mentee, Hollaback atcha.

315
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,400
He's selling magazine Subscriptions
As a way to learn Business skills.

316
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,500
Otherwise he'd be forced To join a
gang If he was still On the streets.

317
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,300
If iwerestill out On the
street, I'd be an o.G.

318
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,000
You wish.

319
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,300
Okay, just don't
tell anyone I let you in.

320
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,100
Oh, thank you very much.

321
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,500
Now what exactly
Are we looking for?

322
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,000
Evidence.

323
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,000
Evidence to corroborate The story.

324
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,200
Check it out.

325
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,500
Look at the way the blood's
Sprayed along the wall.

326
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,100
- Just look.
- What?

327
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100
The aortic spatter?

328
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,400
Sure. It means that The super's aortic
artery Was punctured During the murder.

329
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,700
- The built-Up blood pressure Causes different--
- Wow.

330
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,800
Some of us like
To be prepared, shawn.

331
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,600
No, no.

332
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,300
When ryan came Into the station,
He only had blood On his hands.

333
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,700
If he'd killed the super, Wouldn't it
have sprayed All over his clothes too?

334
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Oh, no!

335
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,000
Oh, my gosh! Ah!

336
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,200
That means the super Was in the wrong
place At the really, really Wrong time.

337
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,600
The assassins took him out
Thinking he was ryan.

338
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,100
How'd they know Where
to find you, huh?

339
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
Because i was looking For them.

340
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,300
I was asking around,
Putting up fliers.

341
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,400
That means ryan's
Telling the truth.

342
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Which also means that

343
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,100
there's Someone else out there
With a target on their back.

344
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,500
Gus, look.

345
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,700
Ryan really did work
At busch gardens.

346
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,600
Is that what he thinks
Good hair looks like?

347
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,000
I think that's koko b. Ware.

348
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,900
Shawn, come on.

349
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,700
Look, he's letting ryan
Shoulder the parrot.

350
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,500
Where we gonna find
These so-Called assassins?

351
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Mm-Hmm-Mm.

352
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,700
But ryan's the only one
That can help us find them.

353
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,100
Even if they did exist,

354
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,200
The chief was emphatic When she said
She does not want us Talking to ryan

355
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,700
While he's In police custody.

356
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,900
- Bingo.
- Don't say bingo.

357
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,400
- Cranium.
- Now i'll play Some cranium.

358
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,500
How much do we have In
the psych savings account?

359
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,500
I really hate When
you ask that question.

360
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,000
Thank you very much.

361
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,500
What are you doing here?

362
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,800
Dapper dan.

363
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,500
We're just gonna pay a visit
To our old buddy ryan.

364
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,100
You were given direct orders
To stay away from him.

365
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,600
- Yeah, we don't take Orders well.
- No.

366
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,100
Unless they're to get
On the dance floor.

367
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,900
- Or raise the roof.
- Make some noize... With a z.

368
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,200
You know what,
Just forget i asked, okay?

369
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,200
What is it, first day
With the new feet?

370
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,900
He spent all day in court
Waiting to testify in a case

371
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,400
And the defense attorney
Didn't show up again.

372
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
But he's right.

373
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,900
You guys can't communicate
With ryan while he's in custody.

374
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,000
I guess it's a good thing
He's no longer in custody,

375
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,600
Seeing as how we
Just posted his bail.

376
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,000
Looks like paper.
Actually our life savings.

377
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,400
Bye-Bye.

378
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,800
Hey, you guys want lunch?

379
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,800
You know,
i own A restaurant downtown.

380
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,200
Actually, It's not all mine.
I co-Own it with mike ditka.

381
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,000
You guys eat wild
game, Don't ya?

382
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,800
Once we find The real killers,
The police Will believe us.

383
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,200
Us? What us?

384
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,100
I'm not convinced You
didn't kill that dude.

385
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,200
Blood splatter Is
a subjective science.

386
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,400
It was the assassins.
I'm telling you.

387
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,500
And if we don't stop 'em,
They're gonna kill again.

388
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,700
I think ryan has a point.
Is there a kinko's nearby?

389
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,800
We should make
Some new fliers.

390
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,300
- What information Do you actually have?
- Well, i-I don't know If it's enough,

391
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,000
But i did overhear A time,
a place, and a name.

392
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Come again.

393
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,500
I know who, what,
And where.

394
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,600
Ryan, that-- That's everything
We need to know. That's all of it.

395
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,900
Why didn't you just say
that In the first place?

396
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
Because no one Would let me.

397
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,200
That's true.
Gus, that's very true.

398
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Yeah, i got that, shawn.
Just go ahead, ryan.

399
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,100
- The time was 10:00.
- 10:00.

400
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,300
To 4:30.

401
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,400
- 10:00 to 4:30.
- Yeah.

402
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,000
A six-Hour window?

403
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,400
What, do your killers
work At the cable company?

404
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,800
It's okay.
What's the place?

405
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,500
420.

406
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,500
420 something.

407
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,100
I didn't get a street name
Or an apartment number,

408
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,400
But the address
definitely Has a 420 in it.

409
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,400
Hmm.

410
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,600
But the name, I have.

411
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,400
Perfect. What is it?

412
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,500
- Tom.
- Tom.

413
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,300
You wouldn't happen to
have A last name, would you?

414
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,900
Come on, guys, i can't
do Everything for you.

415
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,000
Oh, i'm teaching A water
aerobics class In 20 minutes.

416
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,400
I- I gotta go.

417
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,200
Go? We just bailed
you Out of jail.

418
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,400
Ryan, it's okay.

419
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,200
I trust you.
Do your thing.

420
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,400
We'll let you know
When we have something.

421
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,200
Perfect. I will have one of my
assistants Track me down wherever i am.

422
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,400
Count on it.

423
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,500
Okay...
but...

424
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Don't worry, gus.

425
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,000
We'll travel faster Without him.

426
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,800
- All right, fine.
- Every liar has a tell.

427
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,700
- So what--
- Sure, he's good.

428
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,800
But if you listen,
It's there.

429
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,100
- All right, will you--
- Step back into the office.

430
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,100
- Will you stop--
- Of course we're gonna stop For tacos on the way.

431
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Thank you.

432
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,500
I'm sorry,
what time Do you close?

433
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,300
Well, If you're closed already,
Why are you answering The phone?

434
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,500
Dude, the clock is
ticking On some guy's life,

435
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,600
And you're out
getting A milkshake?

436
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,100
Gus, don't be
this crevice In my arm.

437
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,400
This isn't a milkshake.
It's a smoothie.

438
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,800
There's a huge difference.

439
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,100
And i was goin' Around
the neighborhood,

440
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,100
Checkin' all the places
That are open From 10:00 to 4:30.

441
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,500
And by blind luck,

442
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,700
One of them just happened To be
the only juice bar In santa barbara

443
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,300
That offers blueberries In the
mist With acai And goji berries.

444
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,300
I didn't order that. This is the
normal Blueberries in the mist.

445
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
How did you do?

446
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,600
I got a list of all The addresses
in santa barbara That begin with 420.

447
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,300
There are over 700
Possibilities, shawn.

448
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,100
4201st street.
4202nd street.

449
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,200
- You get the drift.
- Wow.

450
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,200
I guess next we'll have To comb
through apartments And suites too.

451
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
What are you doing?

452
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,700
I'm sorry, shawn,

453
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,300
But i never fully believed
Ryan in the first place.

454
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,600
I was goin' along With
your gut, As usual.

455
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,000
And i have a non-Negotiable
Distance limit On those trips.

456
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,100
I have a real job.

457
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,700
Well, uh--

458
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Are you telling me you would
Rather sell pharmaceuticals

459
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,600
Than foil An assassination plot

460
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
And clear an innocent man
That's been accused of murder?

461
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,300
Innocent man? We just took on
the world's Most unreliable client.

462
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,000
I get the feeling i'm gonna need
All the commissions i can get.

463
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,000
I'll be spendin' The next six weeks
praying He doesn't skip out On his hearing

464
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,000
So we can get
Our bail money back.

465
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,000
You can get Bail money back?

466
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,500
Well, what am i supposed To do?

467
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,000
I don't know.
Call the human lie detector.

468
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,300
Okay.

469
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,500
Ryan, just, uh,

470
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,000
Just tell him exactly
What you told the police.

471
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,200
Oh, i killed the super
Of my building.

472
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,600
What?

473
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,600
That's not-- That's not true At all.

474
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,700
Well, the santa barbara Police
department Seems to think it's true.

475
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,200
Otherwise, why did they Arrest me?

476
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,600
Shawn, if this guy Says that he's guilty,
What the hell am i doing here?

477
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,600
He's lying.

478
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,000
Wait, he's lying about lying?

479
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,400
Yes. No. I--

480
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,400
Ryan, ryan,

481
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,300
Tell him about the assassins.
The creepy assassins.

482
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,200
With the handlebar mustache
And the plot And the--

483
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,600
And the counterclockwise Water. Please.

484
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,200
Assassins?

485
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,900
Counterclockwise water? Really?

486
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,300
Shawn, if i said that,

487
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,000
I would sound crazy.

488
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,600
Dude, youarecrazy.

489
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,900
You're-- You're Way off the reservation.
That's why i'm Trying to keep you out of jail.

490
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,900
When you lie, does that
make you Feel important?

491
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Because if you keep
lying The way you do,

492
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,500
No one will believe you
When it counts.

493
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,700
I will slap you In the face.

494
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,400
Oh, violence Is not the answer.

495
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,800
I would say that you are The second
most sane person In this room.

496
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,400
Ryan, would you excuse us
For just a minute?

497
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,700
Oh, yeah.

498
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,500
Don't wander off.

499
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,000
All right, shawn.

500
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,300
Why are you workin'
So hard on this one?

501
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,600
I work hard on all my cases.

502
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,600
I-I know you do. You work hard
to have fun, To show off.

503
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,100
Look, i'm not an idiot.

504
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,800
I know this guy's Got a screw loose.
He's lying out his ass.

505
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,300
What i don't understand Is why
you're taking this one So seriously.

506
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,300
I guess because nobody,
Including the police,

507
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,900
Believes in him.

508
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,700
- I know what's going on here.
- Oh, really?

509
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,100
Yes, i do.
Shawn, listen to me.

510
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,900
You are not ryan.

511
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,100
Yeah, you stretch the truth
A little bit sometimes.

512
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,600
At least you know
Where the line is.

513
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,000
- Of course i know where The line is.
- But only Because of two things.

514
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,200
One-- You always Had somebody around Who knew
when you were lying And bothered to call you on it.

515
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,500
- What's the second thing?
- Well, i'd like to say That

516
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,400
you always had Enough natural
talent To fall back on.

517
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,300
But i'd be lying.

518
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,200
Listen to me, kid. If you ever drag my ass
Down here again To do guster's job...

519
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,100
I'm gonna hit you up
With a consulting fee.

520
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Okay. Good night, captain.

521
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
What was that?

522
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,200
That was me Saving your life.

523
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,200
From my dad?

524
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,100
We don't know who
We can trust.

525
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,900
We've gotta stay low.

526
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,300
Low.I have a face guy
Who can disguise us,

527
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,000
Get us out of the
country If need be. He's--

528
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,600
Yeah, he's probably Gonna
have to break your nose.

529
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,700
But remember, this is what
You signed up for.

530
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,000
- Stop it!
- What?

531
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,500
This is real.

532
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,700
Your life is in danger. Okay?

533
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,700
Even batman takes off
The cape and the cowl

534
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,300
When he's in the bat
cave With alfred. So just...

535
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,800
Pretend like i'm alfred

536
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,700
And you be ryan...

537
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,000
Wayne.

538
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,600
Ah, it's them!
It's them! Don't get it!

539
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,600
- Hold on.
- Don't!

540
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,500
- Hello.
- Shawn,

541
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,100
i can't believe I'm making this call.

542
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,900
But i figured it out.

543
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,600
I'm standing At 420 main street.
And guess what it is?

544
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,000
A hospital.

545
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,100
Spencer, what the hell?

546
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,000
Are you all right?

547
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,200
Yeah, of course I am. Why?

548
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,900
Well, We got the message That
you were At the hospital.

549
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,700
Something about life And death.

550
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,200
Oh right. That. Well,
we are in a hospital.

551
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,500
And as it happens,
It's filled with both life And death.

552
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,100
I knew i should've
left That message.

553
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,400
What's going on, spencer?

554
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Ryan and i spent Some quality
time In a psychic sweat lodge.

555
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
- Toweled.
- Fully.

556
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,700
And i have had a clear vision
Of the absolute truth.

557
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,300
The target of the assassination
Is right down the hall.

558
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
His name is tom. Tom lieber.

559
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,800
And he needs Police protection.

560
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,800
This more of your bull crap, Bainsworth?
Because in addition To your murder charge,

561
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,100
I'm pretty sure We have enough to charge you
With reckless disregard Of police resources.

562
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,100
- You too as well.
- More than enough grounds.

563
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,300
Wait, no, you have To believe us.

564
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,400
You're killing me.
You're killing me!

565
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,700
Freeze!

566
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,400
Perfect timing. I'm dead.

567
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,000
Thanks a lot.

568
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,500
You.

569
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,400
Out.

570
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,300
No, no, no. I don't want
To hear it anymore.

571
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,100
Get out.

572
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,100
Spencer, Thank you once again
For completely wasting my time.

573
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,900
Once again? Just last week, I gave you the tip
About the twice yearly sale At t.J. Maxx.

574
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,300
Racks and racks Of $7 ties.

575
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,000
Wasting your time?
I don't think so.

576
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,200
What's goin' on?
Is this about the accident?

577
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,800
Because i still Don't remember it.

578
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,000
What accident?

579
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,100
I hit a car.

580
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,900
You mean, you were hit By a car.

581
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,600
No, i hit one.

582
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,000
Or at least, That's what they told me.
I don't remember any of it.

583
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,700
Why would i even
Want to hit a buick?

584
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,500
I don't have anything
Against buicks.

585
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,700
Carlton, look at this.

586
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Sir, are you suffering
From amnesia?

587
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,300
Yeah. Maybe. I think.

588
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,800
Or something like that.

589
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,100
Great, leave it To lyin' ryan to find
The only amnesiac In santa barbara.

590
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,700
Although i won't be the only
Amnesia person much longer.

591
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,200
I'm getting my memory back.

592
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,100
- A little bit each day.
- Look, lieber.

593
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,400
Tom. I never forgot that.

594
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,000
How wonderful for you.

595
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,100
We think you may be
In grave danger.

596
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,500
- No, we don't.
- Yes, we do.

597
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,700
This side of the room,
The cool side--

598
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,600
Sorry, jules, Think that.

599
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,200
Someone may be trying To kill you.

600
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,700
Are you blackmailing Anyone?

601
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,300
Are you Having a torrid affair?

602
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,700
Are you-- Are you part Of treadstone?

603
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,000
Wait,

604
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200

605
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,600
Oh, wow, no. No.
I- I work from home.

606
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,000
Receiving and processing Complaints
For a mattress manufacturer.

607
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,900
On tuesdays, i go out
And get new games.

608
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,200
Maybe throw in a trip
To 7-11 for a grape slurpee--

609
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,700
Which must have been
Where i was going.

610
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Oh, just after 6:00.

611
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,400
Anapamu street.

612
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,800
I would've been there
Right after the...

613
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,000
- What?
- My games...

614
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,700
All over the street.

615
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,900
How great Would those have been
During my convalescence?

616
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,500
Okay, this is fascinating.
Spencer, Make-Believe time's over.

617
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,800
We got real police work To do.
By the way,

618
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,900
you're still A long way's off From connecting
anyone Other than ryan To the murder of that super.

619
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,300
Hey, chief.
What do ya got?

620
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,600
Shawn. What are we doing?

621
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,200
Ryan lied to us again.

622
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,200
He made us look Like fools again.

623
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,200
And now we're standing In a room with
a guy Who literally knows nothing.

624
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,900
- No offense, tom.
- No. None taken.

625
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,000
Visiting hours ended Hours ago.

626
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
You gentlemen need to finish
Your business now.

627
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Oh, our business
Is definitely finished. Trust me.

628
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,900
Tom, i do hope You remember stuff.

629
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,400
Yeah. No, no.
You've got it.

630
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,800
We'll be there in ten.

631
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,400
I certainly hope you didn't make
Dinner reservations At soup plantation.

632
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,700
Gus and i Have already eaten.

633
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,100
Though i suppose we could go Around
the corner And watch you eat, If you'd like.

634
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,300
They just found a body In a vacant office suite
On the corner Of gardener and carrillo.

635
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,500
Really. Any i.D.?

636
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,200
You're not Gonna believe this. It is the defense attorney
On the case I've been trying to give Testimony on all week.

637
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,000
Huh. What about Ryan's assassins?

638
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,500
You should call Either the loch ness
monster Or bigfoot if you get In trouble.

639
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,400
I'm sure they'd be happy To help.

640
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,900
First of all, bigfoot and
i Haven't spoken in five years.

641
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,400
Six, if you don't count His cousin's
wedding. Which was literally, like, Hey, b.

642
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,400
Come on, jules.

643
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,700
You know me. And i know people.
I can read them. You know that.

644
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,200
I've spent enough time with ryan To know when
he's lying And when he's telling The truth.

645
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,200
And there is a kernel of truth
In every one of his stories.

646
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,000
So they cannot be dismissed.

647
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,300
Neither can he.
He's a person.

648
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,400
A person is more than
the tales That they tell.

649
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,200
Yeah, well, right now,
He's more than just a person.

650
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,500
He's a doctor.

651
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,100
You know, they say we
doctors Have a god complex.

652
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,900
But after seven years
Of neurosurgery,

653
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,300
I say we have a complex god.

654
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,000
Look on the bright side, Spencer.

655
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,000
You keep up This losing streak, You will
become completely Useless to the department.

656
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,000
I know. We haven't eaten.

657
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,200
Shawn, we are treading
On thin ice Right now.

658
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,700
Yes, but i'm about to do A double axel Into
a salchow and finish With a sweet little camel toe.

659
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,000
- You mean camel spin.
- I've heard it both ways.
I'm right About the ryan thing.

660
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,200
No, you are obsessed
With this ryan thing.

661
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,800
And, dude, if your psychic
Powers disappear,

662
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,600
Vick won't need
To hire us anymore.

663
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,800
There's no way We can subsist
On the private jobs We get.

664
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,900
How many times
Must we go through this?

665
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,900
I am this close to getting
On the pro bowlers tour.

666
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,800
- I am not doing this.
- Okay, i get it.

667
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,500
We have to make nice
With the chief.

668
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,200
Why do you think i brought
Along this peace offering?

669
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,600
You really think That one container Of
fries quatro quesos Dos fritos Is gonna fix everything?

670
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,000
Yes, i do.

671
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,800
The lawyer Had two
slugs in his chest.

672
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,800
Ballistics is checking
The system for matches.

673
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,500
- Any trace?
- Nothing yet. The lab's gonna call
The second they find anything.

674
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,200
Oh, not now, gentlemen.

675
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,200
We are in the middle
Of a homicide investigation.

676
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,400
And don't think i don't know That
you've been wasting My detectives' time

00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,400
Chief. Chief vick.

679
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,400
Hmm?

680
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,400
Chief karen charles vick.

681
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,200
Here.

682
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,100
Ooh.

683
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,700
It's a fries quatro
Quesos dos fritos.

684
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,300
And apparently
Doesn't travel well.

685
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,300
The point is,

686
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,000
We are sorry for making Lassiter and juliet
Run around town On wild goose chases.

687
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,400
Shawn's psychic powers Have
been a tad On the fritz.

688
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,800
The good news is, they are
back To 100% working order

689
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,700
And we are fully available To help
on this murder case You are now on.

690
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,000
Even more good news,
Those taste better Than they look.

691
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,200
Yes, they do.

692
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,700
Yeah, fine.
Apology accepted.

693
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,600
And my middle name
Is not charles.

694
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,000
I took a shot.
I knew it was a "c."

695
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,300
Now, about this defense
Attorney's murder case,

696
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,600
Any victim Of
an assassination plot?

697
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,500
- Wow. Really?
- As odd as it sounds,

698
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,400
It actually did cross My mind.

699
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,700
So i checked it out. And i can say
With certainty That he is not

700
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,700
the victim Of mr. Bainsworth's
Assassination plot.

701
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,900
The coroner puts time of
death At four days ago.

702
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:07,400
And a recently discovered Witness Who
heard shots at 6:00 That evening confirms it.

703
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,500
Which means the lawyer Was killed Before
ryan allegedly overheard These men planning a hit.

704
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,900
Our victim would've already Been dead
at that point. No need to kill him again.

705
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,700
Unless he was a zombie.

706
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,300
- Chief.
- Yes.

707
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,700
The surveillance video From the back door of
the garage Near the scene of the crime Came in.

708
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,600
It's corrupted.
There's not much of it.

709
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,300
Hey, are those the fries Quatro queso?

710
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,800
Yes, they are.

711
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,200
Hmm. They don't travel well.

712
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,700
O'hara, set it up.

713
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,800
Let's take a look.

714
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,000
Wait. Dude,

715
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,700
she said the lawyer
Died four days ago.

716
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,000
Yes. It's over, shawn.

717
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,500
Four days ago was tuesday.

718
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,500
That means the lawyer Got killed
In a building On gardener street

719
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,100
On the same day That lieber
got hit by a car On anapamu.

720
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,900
Not just the same day,
The same time. Around 6:00 p.M.

721
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,700
And those streets Are
only two blocks away.

722
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,100
Ryan, the lawyer, lieber.
They're all connected somehow.

723
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,200
Come on.

724
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,900
Fries

725
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,700
Sorry to interrupt. I just got a very strong vibe
That you're about To apologize to us.

726
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
In what world would we
Ever apologize to you?

727
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,100
Wayne's. Maybe dave's.
It's a small...

728
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,100
- Spencer.
- I believe this dvd Will prove That
ryan and i Have been right all along.

729
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,300
Now, who's that?

730
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,300
O'hara, rewind that.

731
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,200
No way.

732
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,800
That's tom lieber.

733
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,900
That's the kid That bainsworth
led us to At the hospital, chief.

734
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,900
And he's running away From
where the body was found.

735
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,100
Well, i guess You
were right, Mr. Spencer.

736
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,100
Lieber must've killed The lawyer And then
got hit By the car As he fled the scene.

737
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,100
Ooh, uh, i don't know. The spirits are
a little Cloudy on that part, chief.

738
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,800
I'm sorry for the spirits, But we
don't have time For gray areas.

739
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,600
Detectives, i want you to get
To that hospital right now.

740
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,900
From what i understand,
Lieber is regaing his memory.

741
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,400
And the second he remembers
What he did, he could run.

742
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,100
- Come on, let's go.
- Got it.

743
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,400
She knows she's not
Gonna eat that.

744
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,300
- What?
- I don't think Lieber's the killer.

745
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,400
I saw something
on the tape. Hold on.

746
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,600
There.
Right there.

747
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,400
He stops and looks back
Over his shoulder. Why?

748
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,700
Because someone Is chasing him.

749
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,200
Two creepy someones To be exact.

750
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,100
Lieber didn't kill the lawyer,
But he saw who did.

751
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,700
Ryan's assassins. They chased him into traffic,
And they thought That was the end of it.

752
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,800
But then the newspaper
reports That he survived,

753
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,800
Goes into a coma,
Wakes up with amnesia.

754
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,300
The killers think
They still have a window.

755
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,200
But today's paper said
He's regaining his memory.

756
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,100
So ryan overheard The real killers
Plotting to take out lieber.

757
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,800
We have got to get
back To the hospital

758
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,500
And tell lassie and jules That these guys are
comin' back To clean up their own mess.

759
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,800
Come on!

760
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,000
???

761
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,000
Yeah, dobson, i need An a.P.B.
Out On a thomas lieber.

762
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,400
He's wanted for
questioning In a murder.

763
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,800
Get his picture From the dmv.

764
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,100
- Where's lieber?
- Gone. Looks like He's on the lam.

765
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,600
He's on a lamb, He won't get far.

766
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,800
Alpaca, different story.
Those things really fly.

767
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,900
You two don't need To be here.

768
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,700
It's not true, lassie.
Lieber didn't kill The lawyer.

769
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,100
He witnessed ryan's assassins Do the deed,
And now they've Clearly come back to get him.

770
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,400
And i promise i will ask All about your insane
Little theories Once i put them both In jail.

771
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,200
Come on, gus.
Let's find tom.

772
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,500
I should've been on
to this Way earlier.

773
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,000
I can't believe I didn't
make the connection.

774
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,000
We don't know That lieber's dead, shawn. Maybe he
rembered And left Before the killers Could find him.

775
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,000
- Hey, guys.
- They're right behind us.
They're gonna kill us.

776
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,800
Drive. Drive.

777
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,300
- Okay, enough with the seatbelts.
- Just-- Let's go!

778
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,200
Just drive!
They're right behind us!

779
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,100
Where'd you Learn to drive!?

780
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,400
- All right, now,
- Wanna keep this upright.

781
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,300
I'm sorry.

782
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,700
I had to take matters Into my own hands.
I snuck lieber Out the ambulance bay.

783
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,000
And when i saw you guys Pull up,
I knew we could hide In the car.

784
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,700
Incoming!

785
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,500
So wait. You just took him
Out of the hospital?

786
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,900
Well, i had to act quickly.

787
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,500
Tom started to rember Everything.

788
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,000
Well, not everything really. Yet.

789
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,500
And the killers. The killers
were already In the building.

790
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,500
It was like a game Of cat and mouse
Trying to get out of there Unseen.

791
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,100
- Didn't we just use The elevator?
- Would you please Let me tell the story?

792
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,800
Parking. He's parking.
He's parking!

793
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,500
Very nice, partner. You just weaved
your way Through those obstacles

794
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Like a ferret On roller skates.

795
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,900
Hey, what are you doing?

796
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,800
Why are we slowing down?

797
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
No, no, no.

798
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,600
Gus.

799
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,200
What-- What-- What
What are you doing?

800
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,600
Dude, the killers
Are right behind us.

801
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,100
Nobody's following us, shawn,
And there never was.

802
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,200
The only thing i know For sure right now
Is that we are harboring Two fugitives.

803
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,800
Okay, gus, look, I believe ryan,

804
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,400
But i-I understand Why you don't.

805
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,400
I've maxed you out In
the blind faith department.

806
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,700
And that's fair. So you
don't Have to believe him.

807
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,200
Just keep believing in me.

808
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,700
Come on, buddy.

809

It's comin' back to me.

814
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,900
They shot that man.

816
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,000

Not at a complete stop, We won't.

825
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,500
Doctor, this bag is empty.
Is that important?

826
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,100
I'll hold him off. Get him
back To the hospital.

827
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,500
Hopefully lassie and jules
Are still there.

00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,400
Hold 'em off? How?

829

842
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,600
You guys are terrible At
cleaning up after yourselves.

843
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,100
Yeah? And you're lying
About the backup.

844
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,300
Look into my eyes...

845
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,800
And tell me if i'm lying.

846
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,500
There's no backup.

847
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,700
Yah!

848
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,600
They were telling the truth?

849
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,300
Apparently so.

850
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,300
That's a good lookin' Handlebar.

851
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,500
Wonder who His mustache guy is.

852
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,000
Down on e ground, cowboy.

853
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,100

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,900
Ah, good. You're both here.

855
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,300
Whoa. Let me guess.

856
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,200
There's a bomb on a bus.

857
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,700
And-- And-- And if it goes
Below 50 miles per hour,

858
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,900
The whole thing's Gonna explode.

859
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
No, no. No more lies.

860
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,900
I am quittin' cold turkey.
Turnin' over a new leaf.

861
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,500

Just like you said,
I am gonna be just ryan.

864
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,400
If you hadn't believed me,

865
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,800
An innocent person
Would have ended up dead.

866
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,400
And all because I became a guy
Who couldn't be taken At his word.

867
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,800
So i just wanted to come here
To thank you Before i took off.

868
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,700
Well, if it's any consolation,
I believed you From the very beginning.

869
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,700
Especially since you
recognized I have great hair.

870
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,500
- I was talking about him.
- You were lying.

871
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,100
It's okay. I forgive you.

872
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,600

873
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,800
So where are you off to?

874
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,600
This is unbelievable.

875
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,700
I got tapped to captain A hot
air balloon In a multistate regatta.

876
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,600

877
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,900
Hot air balloons Have captains?

878
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,600
Oh, yeah, of course
They have captains.

879
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,400
Captains, first mates, Deckhands.
