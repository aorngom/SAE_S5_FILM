00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,240
o/~ and I ran o/~

2
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:15,949
o/~ I ran so far away o/~
o/~ I just ran o/~

3
00:00:15,993 --> 00:00:19,296
o/~ I ran all night and day o/~

4
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:25,697
Do you think he saw us?

5
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:30,838
- What up, dipwads?
- Oh, no, Jimmy Nickles!

6
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:32,693
Gimme the money.

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,955
- Actually, we didn't bring it today.
- Here you go.

8
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:37,811
- Gus!
- Give it up, Spencer.

9
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:40,093
Or I'll shove a Jimmy Nickle
sandwich right in your grill!

10
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:41,861
I think it's a knuckle sandwich.

11
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,857
Okay, okay.

12
00:00:45,115 --> 00:00:46,806
And from the kangaroos?

13
00:00:50,563 --> 00:00:54,353
See you tomorrow, butt munches.
It's sloppy joes and tater tots.

14
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:58,870
You know, Gus, one of these days,
we're gonna stand up to Jimmy Nickles.

15
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,511
Yeah, I think I'll stay home
sick that day.

16
00:01:04,735 --> 00:01:05,884
It's about time.

17
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:08,329
Sit down, I have troubling news.

18
00:01:08,384 --> 00:01:10,815
You forgot to Tivo America's
Next Top Model, didn't you?

19
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:13,278
Why is it so hard
to set the season pass?

20
00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:14,706
It's not top model related.

21
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:18,162
- What is it?
- Jimmy Nicholas called.

22
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:22,399
Jimmy Nickles called us?
From where? Prison?

23
00:01:22,484 --> 00:01:24,457
I don't think so.
It didn't sound like it.

24
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:25,705
What does prison sound like?

25
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:26,976
- Is there singing?
- Shawn!

26
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:29,960
- I don't know. He left a message.
- Don't you dare return that call.

27
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:32,751
I don't need to.
He's coming here in five minutes.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,514
Jimmy Nickles coming here?

29
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:38,983
- In five minutes?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,800
We can handle this.
We can handle this.

31
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:46,205
I'm gonna go print out
a fake fore closure notice

32
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:48,483
and stick it on the front door.
And then we both can go outside

33
00:01:48,506 --> 00:01:50,124
and scrape the "psych" sign
off the front window.

34
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:52,374
Gus, I think we can afford
to relax a little bit.

35
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:54,152
He said he wants to talk,
and by "talk"

36
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:56,296
I hope he means talk,
not my head in a toilet.

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,081
- He's gonna try and kill us.
- He's not gonna kill us.

38
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,977
Right? I mean, people change.

39
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:03,552
We haven't seen him
since the fifth grade.

40
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:05,439
I don't need
to see him, Shawn.

41
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:07,152
Some people are just born evil.

42
00:02:07,196 --> 00:02:09,362
The kid from the Omen,
the Children of the corn,

43
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,936
Chad Michael Murray.

44
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,616
What is this?

45
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:19,087
Ooh, ebay! Auto bid.
600 bucks plus...

46
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:20,704
A penny...
The penny's a trick.

47
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,113
I got in a full-on bidding war
with a montessori school.

48
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:24,970
What do we need a locker
in the office for?

49
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:28,174
First of all, I have now here
to put my sociology text book.

50
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:29,322
And...

52
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:37,610
You always gotta hit it
right on the nose, don't you?

53
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:39,231
Why couldn't I be Crockett?

54
00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:41,231
Because, Gus.

55
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:42,700
You stood in front of
the entire third grade class

56
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:44,446
and said, "when I grow up,
I wanna be

57
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,714
- Philip Michael Thomas."
- Well, you said you wanted

58
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:48,339
to be the mascot
for the Milwaukee brewers.

59
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:49,996
Dude, he's the biggest sausage
in the world.

60
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:52,189
Why is Jimmy Nickles
coming here, Shawn?

61
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:53,785
- How big is he now?
- I don't know!

62
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,232
Why couldn't you be a real psychic?

63
00:02:56,722 --> 00:02:59,634
- Hey, you guys in there?
- Oh, god, that's him.

64
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:01,985
He's not getting my lunch money,
I'll tell you that much.

65
00:03:01,996 --> 00:03:04,438
Great, you can terrify him
with your wally joyner mini-bat.

66
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,470
Open the door.

67
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:18,693
What up, boys?

68
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:27,866
That's a good call
with the mini-bat.

69
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:32,910

You d-bags gonna let me in or what?

77
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:56,717
D- bags?

78
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:58,794
Yeah, come on in, Jim.

79
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:03,989
- Way not to be scared, flincher.
- I didn't flinch.

80
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,828
- You know I have a caffeine tic.
- Look at this place.

81
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:10,707
Video games, lockers. You two
haven't grown up at all, huh?

82
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:13,515
And you haven't grown up. Up..

83
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,147
At all.

84
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:18,976
Jimmy, as glad as
we are to see you,

85
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:20,832
what are you doing here?

86
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,929
What do you think
I'm doing here, barf beetle?

87
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:25,017
I came to take your lunch money.
Hand it over!

88
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,493
I'm just messing around.

89
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,891
Actually, I'm in town
for, uh, work.

90
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:34,294
I'm sensing...

91
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,896
You became a jockey.

92
00:04:36,857 --> 00:04:37,819
A jockey?

93
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:42,008
Yeah, one of the best jockeys.
Yeah, I won most of my races.

94
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:44,097
Till this stupid Santa Barbara
meet started.

95
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:46,097
Now I'm on some ridiculous
losing streak.

96
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,329
The last three favorites I've
ridden have all lost.

97
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:51,975
And I know it wasn't something I did.
I started to lose all my best mounts.

98
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,769
- Mounts?
- Horses, Guster.

99
00:04:55,084 --> 00:04:56,498
What's wrong with you?

100
00:04:57,737 --> 00:05:01,361
Look, uh, Jimmy, what is it exactly
you'd like for us to do?

101
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:04,162
Well, uh, one of our friends
from our old school

102
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:07,571
told me about your company.
Even though it sounds kinda gay,

103
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:09,698
I thought I could hire you
to come down to the track

104
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,510
and maybe, uh...

105
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,991
Psychically figure out
what's wrong with the horses.

106
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,433
Okay, first of all,
you ride on the back of mounts

107
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:19,162
while carrying a whip.
That's much gayer than what we do.

108
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:25,383
Either way, we're busy right now.
So I don't think we'll be able to...

109
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,162
- We'll take the case.
- I thought so.

110
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:28,444
All right, meet me
at the track at 2:00.

111
00:05:28,477 --> 00:05:31,130
And as far as anyone else knows,
you guys are just some really

112
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,649
- good old friends.
- Got it, dillholes?

113
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:36,637
Got it. You can count
on us dillholes.

114
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,881
Good-bye, Jim.

115
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:42,670
- Are you crazy?
- I wouldn't say crazy.

116
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:44,962
Maybe an eccentric
who looks good in jeans.

117
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:49,504
Come on, Gus, you're not actually still
afraid of Jimmy Nickles, are you?

118
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:52,122
We're not helping that little
monster, Shawn. Period.

119
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,885
Okay, so Jimmy's still a jerk.
We can see that.

120
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:56,400
But the truth is...

121
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:59,099
- I feel like I owe him.
- For what?!

122
00:05:59,148 --> 00:06:02,143
If anything, he owes us
for 170 lunches.

123
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:06,474
You know, I added that up once, and
with inflation, that's, like, $1,800.

124
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:08,302
Look, do you rember
when Jimmy got kicked out

125
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,877
- of school in the fifth grade?
- For killing a teacher?

126
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,379
For hitting Miss Lepky
with a spitball.

127
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:14,772
- She fell and got hurt.
- Same difference.

128
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:16,341
She could've very well
have been killed.

129
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:18,252
It was me
who ratted him out, Gus.

130
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,002
You did that?

131
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,167
- Why didn't you ever tell me?
- You don't know all my secrets.

132
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:26,011
I'm a man of untold mysteries.

133
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:28,630
If he found out, he'd come back

134
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,068
- and gnaw off one of my toes.
- Ratting out Jimmy Nickles?

135
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,035
That's suicidal.

136
00:06:33,057 --> 00:06:35,709
I thought I saw him do it,
and I told principal tropp,

137
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:38,527
because he said he wasn't gonna let the
class go until somebody gave him a name.

138
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,929
And what?
You just had to get home?

139
00:06:40,996 --> 00:06:43,835
Dude, Chips was gonna come on
in, like, 20 minutes.

140
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:45,194
What was I supposed to do?

141
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:46,868
It was the one
with the freeway crash.

142
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,641
Where the car used the empty car
carrier trailer as a ramp

143
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:52,459
- and flipped in mid-air.
- That happens in every episode, Shawn.

144
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:55,045
I was under a lot of pressure.

145
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,408
I always knew you were a kiss-ass.

146
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:23,259
Who cares?
So Jimmy got kicked out.

147
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:24,784
It was the best day of my life.

148
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:27,205
I could finally wear
underwear to school again.

149
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:28,365
I don't know, Gus.

150
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,862
I always sort of felt
like I got the wrong guy.

151
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,552
I'll never forget the look
on Jimmy's face

152
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,525
when they hauled him
out of class that day.

153
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:38,214
I didn't do it!
I promise, I didn't do it!

154
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,517
Look, after Jimmy
got kicked out of school,

155
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:43,650
there were all these stories
about what happened to him.

156
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:46,352
He ran away from home,
he got thrown in juvenile hall,

157
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:47,783
moved to a small town in Kansas

158
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:49,479
where they out lawed
singing and dancing.

159
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:51,352
That last one is Footloose.

160
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:53,120
That's a coincidence.

161
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:55,363
The point is, Jimmy's life
changed that day,

162
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:56,965
and I feel like I gotta
make it up to him.

163
00:07:56,998 --> 00:07:59,092
Who knows, Gus, I might've
stunted the kid's growth.

164
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,362
I don't know, Shawn.
We're talking about the same dude

165
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:03,141
who made Aaron Rencher
eat his own retainer.

166
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:05,993
All right, how about this...
We take the case, right?

167
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:08,169
We prove, for all the
Aaron Renchers of the world,

168
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:10,722
we are no longer afraid
of Jimmy Nickles.

169
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:13,278
All right, fine.

170
00:08:13,316 --> 00:08:16,730
But if we take this case, we're
gonna overcharge him by $1,800.

171
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:17,763
Done.

172
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:29,730
He doesn't like the oats.

173
00:08:30,157 --> 00:08:32,992
Or the alfalfa pellets.
They're too chewy for pellets.

174
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:33,868
Pellets should be crunchy.

175
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:35,680
They should have
a natural crunch to them.

176
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:45,497
Also, the donkey in stable 11
is a pathological liar.

177
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:47,594
This is idiotic.

178
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,481
Look, it takes a while for the
connection to take hold, Jimmy.

179
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,055
Runny D. And I are just
feeling each other out here.

180
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:56,973
Whatever. I gotta go lose five
pounds before the next race.

181
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,183
You got half an hour to figure
out what's going on.

182
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,580
What do you think, Runny D.?

183
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:04,872
I'll tell you what he's thinking.

184
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,600
He's thinking, "I hate Jimmy.

185
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:11,788
"He pulled my shorts down in front
of jenny scarlatos in the cafeteria."

186
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,483
Are you channeling the horse?
Or a little boy with a tight fade

187
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:18,825
who used to wear his O.P.'S
without a drawstring?

188
00:09:18,987 --> 00:09:20,269
The horse, Shawn.

189
00:09:20,324 --> 00:09:22,733
I didn't have a tight fade
in the third grade.

190
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,148
How are you?

191
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:33,215
That's interesting.

192
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:38,235
This place is weird
and borderline depressing.

193
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:41,296
I mean, who are these people?
Who actually comes here?

194
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:44,960
Well, well, well.
This I never thought I'd see.

195
00:09:45,038 --> 00:09:46,794
Wow, dad.

196
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:48,312
Tell me you're wearing that shirt

197
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:50,256
because someone has
to spot you from space.

198
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,019
Very funny, Shawn.

199
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,461
This happens to be one
of my lucky track shirts.

200
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:54,576
I like it.

201
00:09:54,606 --> 00:09:56,771
I'd like it too, if I had
to walk home in the dark.

202
00:09:56,935 --> 00:09:58,968
Henry. This your kid?

203
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:01,598
Hey, kid.
Phil "The Thrill" Shershow.

204
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,041
Shawn.
This is Burton "Oil Can" Guster.

205
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,101
Good to meetcha.
Hey, Henry tell ya for 20 years,

206
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:09,571
I been handicapping horses?

207
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:12,413
That seems so very cruel.

208
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,441
He musta told ya I hit
the pick six in '87?

209
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:17,323
Hey Phil, I think
it's pretty safe to assume,

210
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:19,456
- I haven't told 'em anything.
- Five minutes to post.

211
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:20,031
Gotta make it back.

212
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:23,738
Henry tell ya I like
the 2-3-4 trifecta box?

213
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:29,664
I think your shirt and his shirt
should get together and go bowling.

214
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,538
You have all kinds of interesting pals
I don't know about.

215
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,859
All right, Shawn, look, don't start.
Phil is not a pal.

216
00:10:34,872 --> 00:10:36,828
He's a bad gambler
who doesn't know when to quit.

217
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,104
But he also happens to be
on a hot streak right now,

218
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:41,571
which is why I let him
talk to me. Not that I need it.

219
00:10:41,593 --> 00:10:44,949
I have won 8 of 11 races today.
All by myself.

220
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:47,462
All right, Shawn what are you
doing out here anyway?

221
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:49,394
I tried to drag you
out here for years.

222
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:51,460
I'm only here today
'cause we're working on a case.

223
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:53,549
You know, I think the reason
you never came out here

224
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:54,954
is because to be
a good handicapper,

225
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,888
you gotta put in the time,
you gotta do the research,

226
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:59,662
you gotta study the horses,
you gotta study the jockeys.

227
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:02,429
Something that takes patience
and follow-through,

228
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:04,281
- which you lack.
- Yes.

229
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:06,911
That and a shirt
from Mr. Furley's closet.

230
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:10,152
And the race is on.

231
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:12,119
Babyfaced assassin
takes the early lead.

232
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:15,355
Babyfaced assassin strides
into the first...

233
00:11:15,443 --> 00:11:16,957
So what's the case?

234
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:18,857
Have you ever heard
of a Jimmy Nickles?

235
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,449
You mean Jimmy Nicholas.
Yeah, solid jockey, bad bet.

236
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,748
- He's been losing lately.
- That's why he hired us.

237
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:26,327
He thinks that maybe something's
psychically wrong with the horses.

238
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:28,600
Yeah, the horses are losing,
that's what's wrong with them.

239
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:30,300
Yeah, we didn't find anything.

240
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,618
Of course you didn't, there's a
million reasons a horse loses,

241
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,358
and none of 'em have to do
with crystals and moon beams.

242
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:41,429
And it's youthful spirit.
Youthful spirit pulls it out.

243
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,393
What I do is much more than that.

244
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:47,978
- It's... It's intuition.
- Son, you got no case.

245
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,961
Oh, well, thanks.
We'll just go home then.

246
00:11:52,954 --> 00:11:54,969
- Juan Carlos!
- Help him!

247
00:11:57,202 --> 00:11:59,158
Medical assistance to the track.

248
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:02,628
We need medical assistance
to the track immediately.

249
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:05,821
Carlos!

250
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:13,357
So... A jockey who was alive
at the beginning of the race

251
00:12:13,368 --> 00:12:14,882
is dead by the end.

252
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,623
Not to sound insensitive,
but I say we do have a case.

253
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:21,774
- That sounds insensitive.
- Yeah, I know.

254
00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:27,415
And you guys just happened
to be at the track?

255
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:29,052
Jules, it's free churro day.

256
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:31,096
Do they have
a cause of death yet?

257
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:32,586
Probable heart attack.

258
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:41,685
Uh, O'hara, I...

259
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:43,866
Need you to interview
the rest of those jockeys.

260
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:46,777
- What is that?
- Sorry.

261
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,562
It's just little people
make me...

262
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:52,391
Well, let's just say I had a bad
experience with a christmas elf.

263
00:12:52,703 --> 00:12:54,637
What, he didn't give you
the right present?

264
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:57,312
No. We dated.

265
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:01,010
And then he dumped me for a dancer
from the ice storm on ice.

266
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:05,919
She is an enigma wrapped
in a little, blonde riddle.

267
00:13:06,707 --> 00:13:10,895
Shawn, I don't think Juan Carlos
died of a heart attack.

268
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,486
I only got to see him for a second,

269
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:14,427
but I'm pretty sure
he had blood shot eyes.

270
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,328
And his body was totally stiff.

271
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:18,913
That's a reaction to a tranquilizer
or even a poison.

272
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:20,839
Something affected
his nervous system.

273
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,226
Thank you, Dr. Pratt.

274
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,861
- See if we can get another look at that body. 
- You bet.

275
00:13:25,894 --> 00:13:28,690
Hey, you two, don't go anywhere.
I wanna talk to you when I'm done.

276
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:30,104
Gus has a cramp.

277
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:32,628
I have a cramp?

278
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:35,043
We have to pee.

279
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:38,500
Fine, just be back
in five minutes.

280
00:13:39,037 --> 00:13:40,860
"We gotta pee?" that's the
best you can come up with?

281
00:13:40,882 --> 00:13:42,295
Just hurry up.

282
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:45,311
Really?

283
00:13:47,123 --> 00:13:49,483
How short was this guy?
Give it one more.

284
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:51,844
We have boots.

285
00:13:52,518 --> 00:13:54,927
We've confirmed that
a heart attack was the cause

286
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:56,923
of Juan Carlos espinoza's death.

287
00:13:57,695 --> 00:13:59,737
Wait. Everyone stop.

288
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,367
Let's acknowledge that the chief
is wearing leopard print.

289
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:07,026
And continue.

290
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:08,667
I'm getting something.

291
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:12,778
A rose with, with, with...
A thorn. No.

292
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,626
A rocket. Rikki rocket.
C. Deville.

293
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:17,140
- David Lee Roth?
- Wrong band.

294
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:21,577
- Poison.
- Yes. Poison.

295
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,124
Juan Carlos was poisoned.

296
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:28,135
- He's right.
- Chief, I am so sick of Lassiter

297
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,278
treating us like
second-class citizens.

298
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,644
- What?
- You're right.

299
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,081
Espinoza had a cocktail
of drugs in his system.

300
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,606
Opiates, barbiturates, cocaine,

301
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,086
three different kinds
of weight loss drugs,

302
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,808
- cyalis, and horse tranquilizers.
- Horse tranquilizers?

303
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:43,686
Apparently, the guy took
everything in sight.

304
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,941
He was 4'9" and 3 feet of that
were drugs.

305
00:14:45,974 --> 00:14:48,140
And obviously,
his heart couldn't handle it.

306
00:14:48,156 --> 00:14:50,421
A very thorough job, detectives.

307
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:52,573
I'm getting something else.

308
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,062
Juan Carlos was having
an affair.

309
00:14:55,776 --> 00:14:57,201
With a married woman.

310
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,246
- Shawn, how do you know this?
- Same way I know that as a child,

311
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,661
Lassie wanted nothing more
than a pony.

312
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:06,645
Well, come on, who didn't?

313
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:08,886
Anyone who wasn't
an eight-year-old girl.

314
00:15:08,918 --> 00:15:11,901
Uh-oh. I see a tall, blonde woman.

315
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,351
- Brigitte Nielson?
- No!

316
00:15:13,385 --> 00:15:15,241
She has 23 diamonds
in her wedding ring.

317
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,019
And she bandies about the track,
this way and that.

318
00:15:18,044 --> 00:15:20,851
Shouldn't we at least
find this woman and talk to her?

319
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:22,984
Do you know anything
about this, detectives?

320
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:28,457
Oh, well, maybe you should find out
before we put this case to bed.

321
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:32,428
Lassie...

322
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,165
Your childhood
must've been pure hell.

323
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:38,855
The good news, I'm available
for hugs.

324
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:44,778
Jules. How about it?

325
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:50,477
- Buddy. It's been a while.
- Please.

326
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:05,736
- You're here early.
- Yeah, couldn't sleep, you know?

327
00:16:05,825 --> 00:16:09,670
Came in early, did a little
work on the case. Went for a run.

328
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,250
Oh, and I did this.

329
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:15,879
Nice. I did some work as well.

330
00:16:15,898 --> 00:16:20,130
Turns out the horse tranquilizer Juan
Carlos had in his body was ketamine.

331
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:21,636
Which doesn't make any sense.

332
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:24,200
'Cause ketamine causes a state
of anesthesia.

333
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,504
Well, that's good, Gus, but I was
talking about the spitball incident.

334
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:28,874
The spitball incident?

335
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:30,978
Shawn, you need
to leave that alone.

336
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:33,066
If you haven't figured it out
by now, you never will.

337
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,003
I can't leave it alone. I won't.

338
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:39,153
I've gone over it in my head a
thousand times. Just hear me out.

339
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,614
- What are you doing here?
- This is my head, dude.

340
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,915
I can do whatever I want.
What did we miss?

341
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:53,799
What's going on here?

342
00:16:53,843 --> 00:16:56,395
Is that what my hair looks like
in the future?

343
00:16:56,415 --> 00:17:00,092
- It sure is.
- But I thought I'd be bald by 20.

344
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,664
- This changes everything.
- Yeah, it does

345
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:04,824
Think big.

346
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,727
It was Jimmy.

347
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:19,363
He's sipping through the straw,
not spitting it out.

348
00:17:19,397 --> 00:17:20,977
It couldn't have been him.

349
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,465
There was a second spitter.

350
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:28,478
That's so cool.

351
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,887
Let it go, Shawn.

352
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,533
Your second spitter theory
is crazy.

353
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,301
Oh yeah, what about
your teen wolf theory?

354
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:34,724
Hey, that's just a fact.

355
00:17:34,757 --> 00:17:37,508
If any of us were in high school
and some dude became a wolf,

356
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,050
we wouldn't be cool with him just
because he could dunk a basketball.

357
00:17:40,085 --> 00:17:43,179
I certainly wouldn't be selling
"I heart wol I could tell you that.

358
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:46,279
- Oh, save it for your podcast.
- Hey, you brought it up.

359
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:47,829
I'm gonna go talk
to Jimmy Nickles.

360
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:49,022
You look for T.B.W.

361
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:50,981
- T.B.W.?
- Tall Blonde Woman.

362
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:54,218
I abbreviated, Gus. All the kids
are doing it these days.

363
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,301
Just hope we don't
run into my...

364
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:57,268
- Y.D.?
- Y.D.?

365
00:17:57,313 --> 00:17:58,860
Your dad. And it's too late.

366
00:17:58,893 --> 00:18:02,020
Oh, my god, the shirt
has a brother.

367
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:03,663
Ha, very funny, Shawn.

368
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:05,925
If you're looking for your boy
Jimmy, they just announced

369
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:07,833
he was taken off
all the races for the day.

370
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,723
Seriously? I wonder why.

371
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,728
Isn't that Barry Sarner?
The announcer guy.

372
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:15,917
- He's like a local legend.
- Yeah, "the voice," right? yeah.

373
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,991
Hey, dad, do you know him?
Can you introduce us or what?

374
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:21,051
No, I met him once at a policeman's
ball, but it was years ago.

375
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:22,698
Hey, uh, Mr. Sarner.

376
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:24,578
- Hi.
- Look who's here.

377
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:26,922
Your old pal. Hank Spencer.

378
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:30,033
- Do I know you?
- No, but we know you.

379
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:31,414
What is it you always say?

380
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:33,613
"And the race is on."
and the race is on.

381
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:38,999
And the race is... On!

382
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:42,257
- Hey, can you do it for us one time?
- And the race is on.

383
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,327
That's it, right there.

384
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:45,921
Won't you boys
have a button?

385
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:48,235
I'm sorry, Mr. Sarner.
I'm Henry Spencer.

386
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:50,475
This is my son Shawn
and his friend Gus.

387
00:18:50,498 --> 00:18:52,631
They finally just started
coming to the races.

388
00:18:52,655 --> 00:18:53,848
Oh, too bad.

389
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:56,617
The track's probably closing down
after this meet.

390
00:18:57,358 --> 00:19:00,430
- 25 years I've been doing this.
- Why is it closing down?

391
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:03,888
- Well, no one comes anymore.
- Is it because of his shirt?

392
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:06,200
I'm sorry, dad, this is, like,
a genocide of color

393
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:10,167
Somewhere, a rainbow's weeping.
Mr. Sarner, do you know why

394
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,550
Jimmy Nickles was pulled off
all of his races today?

395
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,527
We're his buddies.
We came down to see him.

396
00:19:14,564 --> 00:19:17,719
No, uh... It's a shame, really.

397
00:19:17,752 --> 00:19:20,083
Jimmy was just getting back
to a full schedule.

398
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:22,116
Juan Carlos had taken
most of his good mounts

399
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:24,796
- before he died.
- Really? We didn't know that.

400
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:26,984
Oh, they quarreled about it
all the time.

401
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:28,265
Did they?

402
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,526
Shawn, look. T.B.W.

403
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:34,744
Way to stay on
the abbreviation train, Gus.

404
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,196
You mean the A.T.?

405
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:39,334
You're talking about Janine?
That's Jimmy's wife.

406
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,890
- T.B.W. is Jimmy's wife?
- Yes.

407
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:48,951
Looks like Juan Carlos was taking
all of Jimmy's mounts.

408
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:56,635
I didn't kill Juan Carlos!
I didn't do it, I swear!

409
00:19:56,918 --> 00:20:00,170
- Come on! You gotta believe me!
- Back off.

410
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:05,054
Okay, so let me get this straight.

411
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:06,802
You took on this case
because you felt bad

412
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,755
about Jimmy getting kicked out of
school for something he didn't do.

413
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:12,208
And now you just convinced
the police to reopen the case

414
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:14,536
that led to Jimmy
being arrested for murder.

415
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:17,756
Did I ask for nutshelling?

416
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,300
I think he looks
like a tangelo in that outfit.

417
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,881
Or maybe a clementine
with seeds full of hate.

418
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:25,388
I think he looks like
an evil little creamsicle.

419
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:29,419
- You mean dreamsicle.
- No, Shawn, creamsicle.

420
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:30,668
They're exclusively orange.

421
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:33,908
Okay, Lassiter says you can have
five minutes with Jimmy.

422
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:35,076
Sweet.

423
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:36,859
And good job, by the way.

424
00:20:36,894 --> 00:20:39,966
We never would've reopened the case
and arrested him if it wasn't for you.

425
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:42,400
You didn't tell Jimmy that, did you?

426
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:43,935
No.

427
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:48,150
- I didn't kill Juan Carlos.
- We know.

428
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:51,200
Someone must've tipped'em off.
But I swear I didn't do it.

429
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,963
Say Jimmy, isn't that
exactly like you

430
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:55,709
and that spitball incident?

431
00:20:59,498 --> 00:21:00,857
Guys!

432
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,506
Look... I think what Gus is trying
to say is we'd really like to help.

433
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:07,951
- We would, but the evidence.
- What?

434
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:09,551
- Juan Carlos took all your mounts.
- Yeah.

435
00:21:09,677 --> 00:21:11,220
- You fought with him over it.
- Yeah.

436
00:21:11,262 --> 00:21:13,286
- They found ketamine in your locker.
- That wasn't mine.

437
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:15,907
And your wife was having an affair
with Juan Carlos.

438
00:21:15,936 --> 00:21:16,940
What?!

439
00:21:19,116 --> 00:21:21,366
All right, purvis,
put me down.

440
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:24,476
Don't push me.

441
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:26,811
I'm getting the feeling
he didn't know about the affair.

442
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:27,858
You think?

443
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:31,006
I'm sorry, I just...
I can't believe she would do that.

444
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:34,447
Especially after I told her I wouldn't
sleep with any more russian models.

445
00:21:37,465 --> 00:21:40,026
I think we may have
gotten off point, Jimmy.

446
00:21:40,027 --> 00:21:41,512
Let's go back to the beginning.

447
00:21:41,581 --> 00:21:43,534
Obviously, the races you lost

448
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,841
are somehow connected
to Juan Carlos's murder.

449
00:21:45,842 --> 00:21:47,628
So is there anything else
you can tell us

450
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:50,133
or that you remember
about those races?

451
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:52,610
No. The horses were all running great.

452
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:56,205
But right around the... clubhouse turn,
they all faded down the stretch.

453
00:21:56,903 --> 00:21:58,714
All of them faded
down the stretch?

454
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:02,232
You know what?
Yeah.

455
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:03,734
Good.

456
00:22:04,454 --> 00:22:06,307
That's a good place to begin.

457
00:22:09,656 --> 00:22:11,368
All right, that's enough,
Shawn, let's go.

458
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:13,208
You've been standing
at that thing for an hour.

459
00:22:13,774 --> 00:22:15,755
Let me take off my shoes
and try it lying down.

460
00:22:15,795 --> 00:22:17,791
No, Shawn.
You don't have anything.

461
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:19,546
It's a dead end.
Face it.

462
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,824
- We have to tell Jimmy he's screwed.
- Fine.

463
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:23,565
- You tell Jimmy.
- Me?

464
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:26,070
I never wanted to take
this case in the first place.

465
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:29,097
I'll race you for it.

466
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:31,136
What?!
No.

467
00:22:31,221 --> 00:22:33,344
That's right. And I know why.

468
00:22:33,382 --> 00:22:34,245
Why?

469
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:36,687
'Cause I beat you in the 100-yard dash
in the junior high olympics.

470
00:22:36,724 --> 00:22:38,393
Please! First of all,

471
00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:41,705
you know I had shin splints,
a torn meniscus, and a planter's wart.

472
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:44,639
Gus, you copied those terms from
the glossary of our health textbook.

473
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,944
- You have no idea what they mean!
- Ask my doctor.

474
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:50,010
I had a ruptured patella too,
but I wasn't gonna say anything.

475
00:22:50,365 --> 00:22:51,723
Besides...

476
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,705
- Go!
- Oh, no! No, you didn't!

477
00:23:10,883 --> 00:23:13,246
- You almost had me.
- What?

478
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,609
I had you by at least a foot.

479
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,209
- I'm gonna give this to you.
- I thought so.

480
00:23:19,294 --> 00:23:20,681
Not because you won.

481
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:23,737
'Cause you need a victory in your life
more than I do right now.

482
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:24,783
What?

483
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:27,291
Oh, no. We're going again.

484
00:23:28,055 --> 00:23:29,470
I got a better idea.

485
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:34,553
Seven flights of stairs just to get
another view of the track?

486
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:37,530
Gus, this is the perfect spot
for us to see...

487
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:38,594
You'll find...

488
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,150
To see where the magic happens.
I told you he'd be here.

489
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:44,356
Can I help you fellas?

490
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,245
Uh, yeah, uh...

491
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:48,754
"And the race is on."

492
00:23:50,251 --> 00:23:52,218
I really don't think you should
be up here right now.

493
00:23:52,219 --> 00:23:54,729
I'm trying to finish my taped
announcements for the day, so...

494
00:23:54,772 --> 00:23:57,044
Ooh, can I do one?
I've always wanted to be an announcer.

495
00:23:57,096 --> 00:23:59,898
Would the owner of a
red iroc-z in lot three

496
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:03,549
kindly return your comb to
the back pocket of your acid-wash

497
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,297
z. Cavariccis?

498
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:07,563
And turn off your headlights.

499
00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:10,180
What do you think of that, huh?

500
00:24:10,245 --> 00:24:11,476
Have a button.

501
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:14,068
Hey. I've seen one of these before.

502
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:16,587
Yes, it's a shaman's staff.

503
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:19,771
Yeah, I saw a special
on the history channel...

504
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:21,597
About the... The choctaw indians.

505
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:23,372
Ah yes, the chaka indians.

506
00:24:23,373 --> 00:24:26,356
Long-standing rivals
of the sleestak cowboys.

507
00:24:26,418 --> 00:24:28,116
It's pronounced choe-koe.

508
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:31,058
Gave us the chocodile,
amongst other things.

509
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,708
I don't think so.

510
00:24:32,858 --> 00:24:35,863
I've been collecting these artifacts
for a number of years.

511
00:24:35,864 --> 00:24:40,279
I'm actually 1/16 indian myself...
But not cherokee.

512
00:24:40,402 --> 00:24:43,180
Hey, Gus is... 1/16 robot.

513
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,980
And not the evil, take-over-the-world
fromi, robotkind.

514
00:24:48,556 --> 00:24:50,580
Oh... Sorrry...

515
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:54,626
Hey, you're the guy that tried
to save Juan Carlos.

516
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:58,116
You're the only one who tried to help.
Way to go. You should feel proud.

517
00:24:58,138 --> 00:24:59,143
Yeah.

518
00:24:59,228 --> 00:25:00,983
Uh, he died.

519
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:02,634
Yes, he did do that.

520
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:03,719
Yeah.

521
00:25:07,094 --> 00:25:08,637
Well, gentlemen, uh...

522
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:12,778
Ryan and I have to go over some publicity
photos. So if you'd be kind enough...

523
00:25:12,838 --> 00:25:16,277
"And the race is on!"

524
00:25:17,252 --> 00:25:20,620
Chaka? Really?
Yeah, I'd be embarrassed if I were you.

525
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,122
I'm not embarrassed at all, Gus.

526
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:25,221
Aland of the lost reference is virtually
unheard of in everyday conversation.

527
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:27,402
- Can we go and see Jimmy now?
- Not yet.

528
00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:29,456
Barry has tapes of the races in there.

529
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:31,650
Which means there's a copy
of the one Juan Carlos died in.

530
00:25:31,651 --> 00:25:33,221
I don't know why I didn't
think of this before.

531
00:25:33,222 --> 00:25:34,452
We need to see that tape.

532
00:25:34,678 --> 00:25:36,560
There's no way Barry's
gonna let us back in there.

533
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:38,029
Don't the police have a copy of it?

534
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:41,421
They do, but Lassiter's convinced
the case is closed, so he won't help.

535
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:44,149
Which means I'm gonna have to do
something I know I will regret.

536
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:46,597
What? Ride your dirt bike
off of David King's roof again?

537
00:25:46,674 --> 00:25:49,795
No... Ask my dad for a favor.

538
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:55,552
So I was hoping that in your
very meticulous, detailed mode,

539
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,379
it occurred to you to...

540
00:26:01,023 --> 00:26:02,268
I can't do it.

541
00:26:03,225 --> 00:26:05,423
He wants to know if
you tape all the horse races.

542
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:06,951
- Of course I do.
- Awesome.

543
00:26:06,952 --> 00:26:09,003
Can we watch the one
when Juan Carlos died?

544
00:26:09,077 --> 00:26:10,082
You may.

545
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,914
On one condition.

546
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:19,892
Deal is you go with me
to the derby on Sunday

547
00:26:19,893 --> 00:26:20,961
in that shirt.

548
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:24,105
What did I say
about regret, Gus?

549
00:26:24,106 --> 00:26:26,028
- What did I say?
- I think you pull it off.

550
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,089
Shawn.

551
00:26:28,985 --> 00:26:29,990
Fine.

552
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:31,730
All right, here's the race.

553
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:33,289
Juan Carlos is on
the number eight horse.

554
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,048
I remember this, 'cause Phil
convinced me to go with the long shot.

555
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:38,667
The one time I go with the guy,
and the horse loses.

556
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:42,147
I don't get it.
What are we missing?

557
00:26:42,148 --> 00:26:44,447
- What... What aren't we seeing?
- Maybe nothing.

558
00:26:44,448 --> 00:26:47,419
- Maybe Jimmy did poison Juan Carlos.
- I know he didn't poison Juan Carlos,

559
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,154
just like I know there's
a second spitter.

560
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:51,233
Shawn, once again, you're focusing
too much attention

561
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,003
on one aspect of the case.

562
00:26:53,004 --> 00:26:54,150
- Close your eyes.
- No,

563
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:55,709
I'm not jumping through
any more of your hoops today.

564
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:58,668
You need to broaden your vision, Shawn.
You need to look at the outskirts

565
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:01,046
- of the case.
- What does that even mean?

566
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:02,372
Broaden my vision?

567
00:27:02,373 --> 00:27:04,381
Look at the outskirts of a...
You know what?

568
00:27:04,382 --> 00:27:05,457
I'm out of here.

569
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,678
No. No, no.
Not today.

570
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,104
You sound like Oprah.

571
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:10,901
I don't even know why
I bother coming here.

572
00:27:10,902 --> 00:27:12,768
It's a complete waste of time.

573
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:21,592
A little girl outside just started
crying when she saw this shirt.

574
00:27:27,698 --> 00:27:29,354
Oh, good, good, you're here.

575
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,462
You texted me seven times.
Said it was an emergency.

576
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:33,981
Yes, a color emergency.
But I think I figured it out.

577
00:27:33,982 --> 00:27:36,343
The walls were sandbar white

578
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:38,766
to suppress all creative thought
and hide the asbestos.

579
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:39,998
The walls of what?

580
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,005
Miss Lepky's classroom.

581
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,403
Why is my name
on the detention list?

582
00:27:44,451 --> 00:27:46,800
You got caught eating a Kit Kat™
out of the trash can.

583
00:27:47,224 --> 00:27:50,960
- The point is, when I left my dad's...
- You mean stormed out like a little girl?

584
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:52,445
I did not.

585
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,357
I did.

586
00:27:54,928 --> 00:27:56,032
I'd give you that.

587
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:58,664
I realized my dad was actually right.

588
00:27:58,665 --> 00:28:02,229
I need to broaden my vision,
and that's when I remembered

589
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,046
we all switched seats
in class that week.

590
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:08,355
Right, I had to sit behind Janie Doran
and her creepy neck hair.

591
00:28:08,391 --> 00:28:10,060
And Jimmy...

592
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,820
Moved over two rows,

593
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:16,506
meaning that the second spitter
was on the other side.

594
00:28:18,104 --> 00:28:19,449
Gus, get him.

595
00:28:19,668 --> 00:28:22,102
Shawn, what does this
have to do with horse racing?

596
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,575
- I haven't gotten that far yet.
- Let me know when you figure it out.

597
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:31,098
Let go, Jimmy.

598
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:37,748
- Hello?
- Dude, I figured it out.

599
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:41,321
- Was that really necessary?
- No.

600
00:28:41,782 --> 00:28:42,985
But it was dope.

601
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,728
<i>Babyfaced Assassin
strides into the first turn</i>

602
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:49,959
<i>at the head with none other
right on its tail.</i>

603
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,734
<i>- Babyfaced Assassin...
- Wait for it.</i>

604
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:54,275
<i>Trade the top spot as
they race around the second turn.</i>

605
00:28:55,722 --> 00:28:58,142
Right there!
The clubhouse turn.

606
00:28:58,143 --> 00:28:59,897
Juan Carlos gets hit by something.

607
00:28:59,898 --> 00:29:01,906
This was just like the
spitball incident with Jimmy.

608
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,616
I was so focused on the stretch
that I never looked anywhere else.

609
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,614
You know, I didn't broaden
my vision, Dad.

610
00:29:07,656 --> 00:29:09,582
Shawn, I love nothing more
than to tell you I'm right,

611
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,019
but I have no idea
what I'm right about.

612
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:13,495
Question is why would somebody
kill someone like that?

613
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:23,164
Guys! Juan Carlos's death
was an accident...

614
00:29:23,165 --> 00:29:25,626
Yeah! Whatever hit him
was meant for a horse.

615
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:27,212
This isn't about murder.

616
00:29:27,452 --> 00:29:29,447
It's about fixing races.

617
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:36,272
- The tape's ready?
- Check.

618
00:29:36,273 --> 00:29:37,786
- Fake psychic ability?
- Full of it.

619
00:29:37,793 --> 00:29:39,215
Yes, you are.

620
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:46,150
Mr. Spencer, what is going on?
First you help us get... Oh...

621
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:49,302
Get Jimmy Nicholas.
Now you claim he's innocent?

622
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:50,378
I'm sorry, chief.

623
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:53,023
Psychic solar flares
have temporarily blinded me.

624
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,010
My sense of smell is compensating
for my lack of sight.

625
00:29:57,492 --> 00:29:59,685
Lilacs in a meadow.

626
00:30:01,907 --> 00:30:03,961
- Is that camay?
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

627
00:30:03,962 --> 00:30:05,985
We've got big boy
police work to do.

628
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:07,095
Wait...

629
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,705
My eyes are starting to adjust.

630
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,579
Where are we?

631
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,928
We're in the video room!

632
00:30:14,428 --> 00:30:16,140
I'm blind, Gus. Not deaf.

633
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,057
Mr. Spencer, we don't have
time for this. If you wanted...

634
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:22,418
Those tapes.

635
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:24,994
- What are on those tapes?
- They're the tapes from the track.

636
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:26,820
We reviewed them,
but we didn't find anything.

637
00:30:26,974 --> 00:30:28,035
6-20.

638
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,719
6-28.

639
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:31,140
7-2.

640
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:33,121
Doritos.

641
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,126
Big gulp?

642
00:30:34,127 --> 00:30:35,590
- Slurpee.
- 7-11?

643
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:38,717
These are all the dates
on the tapes.

644
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:41,628
Gus. Let's play these tapes.

645
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:47,796
Stop.

646
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,404
Stop.

647
00:30:54,124 --> 00:30:55,199
Stop.

648
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:01,003
Stop.

649
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:03,787
These are Jimmy's races...

650
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:07,283
- This one is when Juan Carlos died.
- That must be why they're in my head.

651
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:09,477
All of these horses faded
down the stretch,

652
00:31:09,478 --> 00:31:11,274
as if affected by something.

653
00:31:11,275 --> 00:31:12,849
And look here.

654
00:31:13,146 --> 00:31:16,621
Juan Carlos is clearly hit
by something at the clubhouse turn.

655
00:31:16,622 --> 00:31:19,598
He felt the effects immediately,
because he's a tiny human person.

656
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:22,725
With the horses, it takes longer
for them to feel the effects.

657
00:31:22,782 --> 00:31:24,211
And your point is?

658
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:27,763
Whatever hit Juan Carlos
was intended for his horse.

659
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,812
What I'm saying is
that this was an accident.

660
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:33,438
Mr. Spencer, that's a
very interesting theory, but it's...

661
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:36,410
All circumstantial. We're gonna
need some hard evidence.

662
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:38,462
Yeah, but thanks for the A.V. Class.

663
00:31:38,778 --> 00:31:41,368
<i>Youthful Spirit fades down the stretch.
No, wait, he's...</i>

664
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:45,062
<i>He's gaining. It's Youthful Spirit,
Youthful Spirit pulls it out.</i>

665
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:50,312
<i>Youthful Spirit fades down the stretch.
No, wait, he's...</i>

666
00:31:50,313 --> 00:31:53,071
<i>He's gaining. It's Youthful Spirit,
Youthful Spirit pulls it out.</i>

667
00:31:53,114 --> 00:31:55,873
The announcer.
It's the announcer.

668
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:59,351
He sounds surprised.
"Neigh," shocked.

669
00:31:59,528 --> 00:32:02,287
When Youthful Spirit doesn't
fade down the stretch.

670
00:32:02,627 --> 00:32:03,631
Listen...

671
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:06,433
<i>Youthful Spirit fades down the stretch.
No, wait, he's...</i>

672
00:32:06,434 --> 00:32:10,240
<i>He's gaining. It's Youthful Spirit,
Youthful Spirit pulls it out.</i>

673
00:32:11,182 --> 00:32:13,447
He was expecting something to happen
to Juan Carlos's horse.

674
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:14,833
That means he's a part of it.

675
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:17,176
Chief, every psychic nerve in my body
tells me that something really big

676
00:32:17,177 --> 00:32:20,360
is gonna happen at the derby tomorrow
and that we all need to be there.

677
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:23,597
All right.

678
00:32:23,598 --> 00:32:24,941
It's too late to cancel the races,

679
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:27,842
but I can approve a
police presence at the track.

680
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:35,055
I've never been in the jockey
club before, Shawn.

681
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:36,724
Thanks for getting me in here.

682
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,321
It's a good thing we wore
our lucky shirts, huh?

683
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:42,377
Yeah, just worried someone's
gonna stare directly at

684
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:44,132
the pattern and have a seizure.

685
00:32:47,686 --> 00:32:50,686
Shawn, we've had people watching
Barry for the last six races,

686
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:52,836
and they haven't seen anything
out of the ordinary.

687
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:55,013
Admit it, you guys don't have it.

688
00:32:56,152 --> 00:32:57,808
Don't worry. We have it.

689
00:32:58,156 --> 00:32:59,330
I don't know if we have it.

690
00:32:59,358 --> 00:33:01,736
We just gotta figure out
how it all connects.

691
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:04,150
So what is this indian stuff I
got off the internet connect to?

692
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:06,952
That's what we in the fake
psychic community call a hunch.

693
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:09,557
Ladies and gentlemen,
the horses have reached

694
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:13,958
the starting gate for the 84th running
of the Santa Barbara derby.

695
00:33:16,198 --> 00:33:17,627
And the race is on.

696
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,117
Uh-oh, two horses bump
as they come out of the gate.

697
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:22,948
It's the three horse, snare the prize,
and the four, biased opinion.

698
00:33:22,949 --> 00:33:26,511
Kate's Conscience takes the early lead
as the horses reach the first turn.

699
00:33:26,512 --> 00:33:27,635
Authority Figure makes a

700
00:33:27,636 --> 00:33:30,644
strong move on the inside as
the horses race down the backstretch.

701
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:33,778
Authority Figure and Kate's Conscience
battle their way past the fall turn.

702
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,820
Authority Figure begins to take control.

703
00:33:54,722 --> 00:33:57,920
<i>Phil is not a pal. He's a bad gambler
who doesn't know when to quit.</i>

704
00:33:57,921 --> 00:33:59,859
<i>But he also happens to be
on a hot streak.</i>

705
00:33:59,933 --> 00:34:03,797
<i>Henry tell ya I like
the 2-3-4 trifecta box? Huh?</i>

706
00:34:03,837 --> 00:34:06,667
<i>Track's probably closing down
after this meet.</i>

707
00:34:07,694 --> 00:34:10,256
<i>25 years I've been doing this.</i>

708
00:34:11,911 --> 00:34:12,860
Dude, I got it.

709
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:14,459
Get everyone down to the track.

710
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,354
And Authority Figure wins
with ease.

711
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:22,320
I really would like
to cash in my tickets now.

712
00:34:22,405 --> 00:34:24,328
Well, how did she feel coming
around the backstretch?

713
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,343
Everybody hold your horses.

714
00:34:28,904 --> 00:34:30,998
I meant metaphorically,
but I like the love.

715
00:34:31,981 --> 00:34:33,184
I sense the plan.

716
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:36,000
Hatched from the desperation
of watching the track

717
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:38,420
they all love so much
shuttered forever.

718
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:40,529
Isn't that right...

719
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,612
Barry?

720
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:45,461
- Excuse me?
- You are so not excused.

721
00:34:45,911 --> 00:34:48,062
You see, the track is
closing down this year and

722
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:50,638
Barry finally figured out
a way to get paid.

723
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,179
But it was the equine
who told me he had help.

724
00:34:55,453 --> 00:34:59,698
Two people with intimate knowledge of
the races and access to the entire track.

725
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:02,245
They figured out how to control
the outcome of the races

726
00:35:02,246 --> 00:35:04,475
by getting rid of the favorites.

727
00:35:04,787 --> 00:35:07,401
Because there were only a few horses
in the race to begin with,

728
00:35:07,402 --> 00:35:11,152
they bet on the rest of the field,
and their odds of winning went way up.

729
00:35:11,223 --> 00:35:14,025
That is insane.
We didn't do anything.

730
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:15,890
That's not entirely true.

731
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:17,304
Whoa, whoa, what's happening here?

732
00:35:17,305 --> 00:35:19,583
- Gus, little help, buddy.
- I don't do horses, Shawn.

733
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:22,551
Ah, Dale. Dale, uh...

734
00:35:22,552 --> 00:35:24,065
Hold that thought.

735
00:35:31,203 --> 00:35:32,774
- What was I saying?
- Barry was saying

736
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:34,076
they didn't do anything.

737
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:36,111
Really?

738
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:38,928
You used Phil to make
all the bets on the long shots.

739
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,522
And Ryan here...

740
00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:43,975
Well, he took care of knocking out
the favorites from his perch

741
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,093
in the camera well.

742
00:35:45,128 --> 00:35:47,124
- With what, his camera?
- Exactly.

743
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:50,675
Lassie, do me a favor.
Take that camera off Ryan's neck.

744
00:35:50,676 --> 00:35:51,780
Give it a look.

745
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:57,588
There's no lens.

746
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,462
It's some kind of firing mechanism.

747
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,660
Which is why he didn't follow
the horses down the track.

748
00:36:02,732 --> 00:36:04,093
I just wanted to make some money.

749
00:36:04,094 --> 00:36:06,484
- It was Barry's idea.
- Shut up, Ryan.

750
00:36:06,485 --> 00:36:08,079
They can't prove anything.

751
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,183
I'm getting something.

752
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:10,258
A fraction.

753
00:36:10,824 --> 00:36:11,814
1/5.

754
00:36:11,815 --> 00:36:12,918
1/10.

755
00:36:14,531 --> 00:36:15,847
1/16.

756
00:36:16,418 --> 00:36:18,427
Barry's 1/16 choco indian.

757
00:36:18,507 --> 00:36:20,531
And what are the
choco indians known for?

758
00:36:20,532 --> 00:36:21,904
Besides chocodiles.

759
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,860
For using blowguns to kill animals
with darts dipped in poison.

760
00:36:26,438 --> 00:36:28,358
Gus shoots and scores.

761
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:29,986
With an assist from wikipedia.

762
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:32,592
They used darts dipped in ketamine.

763
00:36:32,593 --> 00:36:35,891
A horse tranquilizer strong enough to
slow down a horse in the middle of a race.

764
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:39,137
With darts small enough to be missed
on a 1000-pound horse.

765
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:41,004
But the problem was...

766
00:36:41,005 --> 00:36:43,339
They accidentally shot Juan Carlos.

767
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,397
The ketamine, mixed with all
the other drugs in his system,

768
00:36:46,398 --> 00:36:49,382
and the adrenaline
from the race killed him.

769
00:36:52,648 --> 00:36:55,761
Ryan. You weren't trying
to save Juan Carlos's life.

770
00:36:55,762 --> 00:36:57,487
You were looking
for the evidence.

771
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:03,921
And they almost
pulled it off

772
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,307
by framing poor Jimmy.

773
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:09,527
But they couldn't resist one more
big pay day in today's race.

774
00:37:12,904 --> 00:37:14,888
It's like my dad
always says...

775
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:17,404
Real men take bubble baths.

776
00:37:18,432 --> 00:37:21,489
And... A bad gambler
never knows when to quit.

777
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:22,904
Not bad, kid.

778
00:37:22,905 --> 00:37:23,979
Not bad.

779
00:37:24,205 --> 00:37:26,073
Let's go. Get 'em out of here.

780
00:37:27,272 --> 00:37:30,640
Now... Who wants to take a picture
with the winning horse and jockey?

781
00:37:30,641 --> 00:37:32,729
- Come on, Dad!
- Gus, get over here.

782
00:37:32,776 --> 00:37:35,918
Hey, I finally get my picture
with us in our track shirts.

783
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:38,034
Memories, Shawn.
That's what it's all about.

784
00:37:38,442 --> 00:37:39,885
- Just act natural.
- Yeah.

785
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:46,647
Guys, I don't know what to say.

786
00:37:46,648 --> 00:37:49,889
I guess you're not such total
fartknockers after all. Thanks.

787
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:52,868
That's... So sweet.

788
00:37:53,906 --> 00:37:57,713
Gus, isn't there something you
wanted to say to Jimmy here?

789
00:38:02,126 --> 00:38:03,725
Yes, I do.

790
00:38:03,726 --> 00:38:05,466
I've been wanting to say this
for a long time.

791
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:07,531
- You know, back in school...
- Oh, uh, about that.

792
00:38:08,623 --> 00:38:11,425
I had some time to think
while I was in jail, and, uh...

793
00:38:11,426 --> 00:38:13,478
Maybe I didn't treat you guys
so good back then.

794
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:14,752
Especially you, Guster.

795
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,118
So I'm sorry.

796
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,335
I'm sorry for giving you wedgies,
swirlies, Jimmy Nickle sandwiches,

797
00:38:20,336 --> 00:38:22,473
stuffing you in the trash can and, uh...

798
00:38:23,138 --> 00:38:25,671
- Putting boogers in your clarinet case.
- Whoa.

799
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,655
Feels good to get that off my
chest after all these years.

800
00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:31,480
Huh, yeah.

801
00:38:31,481 --> 00:38:32,626
I could imagine.

802
00:38:33,552 --> 00:38:37,330
Say, Shawn, isn't there something
you want to get off of your chest?

803
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,497
- Are you gonna tell him if I don't?
- What do you think?

804
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,129
All right, Jimmy,
here's the thing.

805
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:49,283
I'm the one that ratted you out
over the spitball incident.

806
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:51,547
Okay, I'm the one that got you
kicked out of school,

807
00:38:51,548 --> 00:38:55,169
and I am the one that you should blame
for almost ruining your life, it was me.

808
00:38:59,308 --> 00:39:00,950
Almost ruining my life?

809
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:04,594
Yeah, I went to live with my dad in
Maul. He let me do anything I wanted.

810
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:06,943
I ate pizza and cookie
dough for breakfast.

811
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:10,029
I had a race car bed.
I lost my virginity at 13.

812
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,024
It was the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

813
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:15,391
Hi!

814
00:39:17,812 --> 00:39:19,536
You two are back together, huh?

815
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:22,522
Dude, she's a former Miss Oxnard

816
00:39:22,523 --> 00:39:25,522
with no sense of smell,
and her dad owns an airport.

817
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,259
Course we're back together.
Latro, boys.

818
00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:39,711
Okay, see...

819
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:42,299
That right there makes
total sense in the world.

820
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:45,270
Yeah, but we can feel good
about solving the case.

821
00:39:47,005 --> 00:39:49,199
Don't you "eh" me.

822
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:52,353
Dude, I broke up a highly intricate
race-fixing syndicate while

823
00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:55,353
wearing a shirt designed by a monkey
coming off a three-day sugar binge.

824
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:56,854
Yes, yes, you did, Shawn.

825
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:59,167
But you still haven't figured out
who the second spitter was

826
00:39:59,168 --> 00:40:00,582
in Miss Lepky's class.

827
00:40:05,366 --> 00:40:06,739
- Gus.
- Yes?

828
00:40:08,183 --> 00:40:09,300
You didn't.

829
00:40:09,846 --> 00:40:10,837
Yes, I did.

830
00:40:28,296 --> 00:40:29,513
You did that?

831
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,357
- And you never told me about it?
- You don't know all my secrets, Shawn.

832
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,641
I guess I too am a man
of untold mysteries.

833
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:39,424
Burton Guster, I am seeing you
in a completely different light.

834
00:40:39,425 --> 00:40:42,962
You are, dare I say, dastardly.

835
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:45,598
Hey, I didn't want Miss Lepky
to get hurt or anything,

836
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,916
but when Jimmy got blamed,
my mouth was shut.

837
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,985
Unbelievable.

838
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:52,721
Face it, Shawn.
I am, and always will be, that good.

839
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:56,330
That's why my friends in school
used to call me "the g."

840
00:40:56,995 --> 00:40:59,415
That's funny, I thought
they called you "big head burton."

841
00:40:59,684 --> 00:41:01,282
Don't you ever say that name.

842
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:03,557
- I know it was you that started that.
- I'm sorry, Gus.

843
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,749
I have a knack for alliteration.
I'm a slave to it.

844
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,154
Besides, how many words
start with b, really?

845
00:41:08,607 --> 00:41:10,032
About 1000.

846
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:11,192
How about bold?

847
00:41:11,193 --> 00:41:12,509
Black? Beautiful?

848
00:41:12,551 --> 00:41:15,466
- Who's gonna call you "Black Burton"?
- You get my point, Shawn.

849
00:41:15,494 --> 00:41:16,488
All right.

850
00:41:17,082 --> 00:41:19,729
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna buy you an ice cream.

851
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,898
And we're gonna discuss some
new, fresh to death nicknames.

852
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,957
How about...

853
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:36,212
"Burton, the billowy bear"?

854
00:41:39,669 --> 00:41:40,674
What?

855
00:41:41,254 --> 00:41:42,483
I'm just...

856
00:41:42,484 --> 00:41:44,577
Spitballing.
It's my first shot.

857
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:50,860
