South Park - Season 11 Episode 2
"Cartman Sucks"

2
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:36,514
This picture I like
to call "The Pierre".

3
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,110
I invited Butters to stay the night,

4
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,982
and while he was sleeping I made
a mustache on his face with cat poo.

5
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:42,114
Ha ha ha ha ha!

6
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:45,723
And this time, when Butters stayed
the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.

7
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:48,495
I call this picture
"The Sleeping Menstrual".

8
00:00:49,952 --> 00:00:52,089
This one, I call "Hot Fudge Mondae".

9
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,810
I really like how the light
plays with the background on this one.

10
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:56,653
Is this all you brought
us over here to see?

11
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,251
Oh no, there's much more.

12
00:00:58,302 --> 00:01:01,652
Let's see... Oh yes, look at
this one: I call it "New Moon Rising".

13
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:03,914
I did a whole study using my ass.

14
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:06,499
Here it is using some
high-contrast stuff.

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,780
Trying out some...
different light filters here.

16
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:13,441
But this is nothing compared
to what I have planned.

17
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:16,499
Because tonight...
is going to be my coup de grace.

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,480
-Butters is staying over tonight?
-Yes.

19
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:21,207
And tonight, while Butters is asleep,
I am going to...

20
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,608
-Hey, fellas!
-Heh!

21
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:25,987
Oh, oh hey, Butters!
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

22
00:01:25,988 --> 00:01:28,630
Yeah. I finished my chores
so I came over a little early.

23
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,563
Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?

24
00:01:30,564 --> 00:01:34,404
No no, these guys were just leaving.
Weren't you guys?

25
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,200
Come on, let's go.

26
00:01:38,002 --> 00:01:40,156
Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.

27
00:01:40,157 --> 00:01:41,057
Butters.

28
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:42,145
Yeah Kyle?

29
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:44,081
Don't you think it's a little strange

30
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:46,377
that Cartman keeps
asking you to stay over?

31
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:48,020
-Kyle!
-What do you mean?

32
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:50,573
-I mean, that if-
-What he means is that he's jealous

33
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:53,698
that you've taken his place as
my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle!

34
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:56,731
-Change is a part of life.
-Yeah, grow up, Kyle.

35
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:58,583
Hrrugh!

36
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:00,566
So what do you wanna do first, Eric?

37
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:02,647
You wanna play a game
or just chitchat for a while?

38
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:05,328
Well actually Butters I think
we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.

39
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:08,465
-But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.
-Yeah, and I'm exhausted.

40
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:09,713
If you are not sleepy yet,

41
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:12,744
I have some more of that nighttime
cold medicine you can drink.

42
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:18,254
You guys! I got it! It seriously!

43
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:20,975
It's the greatest picture ever!
Oh my God!

44
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:23,822
-What'cha do to Butters this time?
-Ihit was genius!

45
00:02:23,823 --> 00:02:26,055
I waited 'til he was
totally asleep, right?

46
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,932
And then I got my camera,
and I pulled down his pants,

47
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:32,703
and then I took a picture
of his wiener in my mouth!

48
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:36,055
-Dude!
-I know I know, check it out, look.

49
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:40,188
I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see?
Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!

50
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:43,311
Dude, how is putting Butters'
wiener in your mouth getting him?

51
00:02:43,312 --> 00:02:45,229
Because that makes Butters gay now!

52
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,139
-No dude, that makes you gay!
-Eh- ...what?

53
00:02:48,343 --> 00:02:51,942
You put a guy's wiener in your mouth,
that makes you gay, stupid!

54
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,444
-Nuh uh.
-Yeah huh!

55
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,684
Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?

56
00:02:56,685 --> 00:02:58,826
(Ehe, that makes you very fucking gay.)

57
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:00,623
But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!

58
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:03,521
-You are now.
-No, no, it was a stupid mistake!

59
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:06,853
-Doesn't matter. You're gay now.
-No, it was just for a second!

60
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,564
What, what can I do?
How how can I reverse this?

61
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,995
-You can't!
-No no wait.

62
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:13,476
I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
-How?

63
00:03:13,523 --> 00:03:15,177
The only way you can cancel it out

64
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:19,283
is to get Butters
to put your wiener in his mouth.

65
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,548
-Really?
-Yeah.

66
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:23,630
Then it cancels out the gay polarity.

67
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:25,912
...Shit, I gotta find Butters!

68
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:28,741
...Idiot.

69
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:33,074
Help me, I thinking I'm
falling in love with you...

70
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:35,829
Butters.

71
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:37,556
Whoa, hey Eric.

72
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:40,980
Butters, guess what?
I have a surprise for you.

73
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:44,591
-A surprise? What is it?
-It's so fuckin' awesome.

74
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:47,903
You're gonna be soo stoked.
It's the best surprise ever!

75
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:49,414
-Oh boy!
-You ready?

76
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:50,831
-Y-yeah!
-Okay!

77
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:53,773
Just open your mouth and close
your eyes and, and get on your knees!

78
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:56,193
-Oh, okay!
-Hang on a second here.

79
00:03:56,198 --> 00:03:57,603
How come uh, I can't see?

80
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,566
'Cause then it wouldn't
be a surprise, would it?

81
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,160
Oh uh, ho yeah.

82
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:02,877
All right, that's good.

83
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:04,743
Okay, open your mouth, Butters?

84
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,244
That's good, just like that.

85
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:09,189
Hey. Hey wait a minute.
This ain't a trick, is it?

86
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,190
You're not gonna, eh stick
something yicky in my mouth, are ya?

87
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:15,572
...I swear on my mother's life, Butters.

88
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:17,948
I am not going to stick
anything yicky in your mouth.

89
00:04:18,014 --> 00:04:20,174
-Wokay!
-All right, you ready?

90
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:22,612
All right just- okay,
open uh- okay, okay, here it comes.

91
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:25,343
Just sit very still, okay? Here we go.

92
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:26,435
BUTTERS!

93
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:28,449
-Uh!
-Whoa! Hey Dad!

94
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:32,399
-Butters! What are you doing?!
-I'm getting a surprise!

95
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,590
Oh my God!
My, my only son, reduced to this!

96
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:37,511
Hey. Where'd Eric go?

97
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:40,066
Butters, how long have
you been doing stuff like this?

98
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,455
-Like what?
-Don't lie to me, Butters!

99
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:46,868
I know your secret now! No wait, wait.
It's okay. It's okay, Butters.

100
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:50,649
This isn't a serious problem.
You're just bi-curious.

101
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:52,413
What's... bi-curious?

102
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:56,617
You are. Just harmless curiosity,
and it doesn't mean anything.

103
00:04:56,618 --> 00:04:58,442
We just need to get
you some help, Butters.

104
00:04:58,443 --> 00:04:59,912
What's going on, you two?

105
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:02,946
Nothin' Mom,
I'm just a little bi-curious.

106
00:05:04,495 --> 00:05:07,933
Father Maxi, I... just don't
know where else to turn.

107
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:11,834
You see, I've just learned
that my son is... bi-curious.

108
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:15,152
Is that true, son?
Are you feeling... confused?

109
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,993
-...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.
-You see?

110
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:22,157
Young man, these confused
feelings that you're having

111
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:26,017
are simply the Devil's way
of trying to get a hold of you.

112
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:28,169
-Really?
-What can I do, Father?

113
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,913
There is a special camp where young
men who are confused, like your son,

114
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,657
can go and be cleansed
by the power of God.

115
00:05:34,722 --> 00:05:38,500
Many bi-curious boys come
out the camp completely cured.

116
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:42,695
A secluded camp where lots of
bi-curious boys are all put together?

117
00:05:42,696 --> 00:05:46,076
-That sounds like a good idea.
-Whoa boy! Camp!

118
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:49,978
Haa haa ha ha ha!

119
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:53,651
Very funny!
I suppose you think you really got me!

120
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,135
-What are you talking about, fatass?
-I checked on the Internet, Kyle,

121
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:59,136
and getting Butters to
put my wiener in his mouth

122
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:01,216
wouldn't make me not gay like you said!

123
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,295
-You figured that out, huh?
-That's right.

124
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,058
And I also learned
from the Internet

125
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:08,400
that just because I put Butters'
wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay!

126
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,250
All I have to do is
throw away the picture,

127
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:13,250
forget it ever happened,
and nobody will ever know.

128
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:16,086
-Except for us.
-Right, except for you.

129
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,256
And all the people we tell.

130
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:23,845
-Why would you tell anybody?
-Because it's really, really funny.

131
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:27,088
...It's not that funny. There's
lots of things that are way funnier.

132
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,042
Like what?

133
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:34,977
Liiike... a tampon... in the school
cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.

134
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:41,842
Liiike, a, a dog crap...
on, on a guy's face!

135
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:43,941
-That isn't funny.
-Yes it is!!

136
00:06:43,942 --> 00:06:47,491
Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off!!
You'd better not tell anybody!!

137
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:50,268
-Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.
-Fine! Whatever!

138
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:52,874
You guys don't have any proof
I put Butters' wiener in my mouth!

139
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,667
It will be your word against mine!

140
00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:58,902
And we all know that everyone
trusts me way more than you guys!

141
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,917
You guys, please don't tell anybody.

142
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:05,706
Okay. We won't tell anybody
as long as you are supernice to us,

143
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:07,234
every day, from now on.

144
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:08,875
Oh right, like that's possible!

145
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:10,922
Alright, fine!
You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?!

146
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:13,288
I'm gonna go home,
and photoshop the picture

147
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:15,854
so that it is your face
with Butters' wiener in his mouth here!

148
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:18,287
And if ANY of you
say anything to anybody,

149
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:21,780
I'll simply show them the
picture of Kyle. Ha ha, ha ha ha!

150
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,560
                

151
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:32,017
Everyone,
say hello to our new camper, Butters.

152
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,312
Hi Butters. Hello. Hi. Hello Butters.

153
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:37,196
-Thank you so much for taking him in.
-Don't worry.

154
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:41,479
Your son just needs to learn that
he can be straight if he chooses to be.

155
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,306
Do you know why you're
here at camp, Butters?

156
00:07:44,307 --> 00:07:46,799
-Because I'm bi-curious?
-That's right.

157
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,961
Like all the campers here,
you're confused,

158
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:50,633
and you don't think there's a way out.

159
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:52,674
But even though some
people would have you believe

160
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:54,342
you can't control how you feel,

161
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:58,200
the truth is that with the power
of Jesus Christ you can be normal.

162
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:00,708
Now, just to make sure
you don't slip up while in camp

163
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:03,555
we assign every camper
an accountabilibuddy.

164
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:07,849
Let's meet Ryan, your accountabilibuddy.
Ryan thought he could never change.

165
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,883
But now he's learning that
with the power of Christ and prayer,

166
00:08:10,884 --> 00:08:12,918
he can have a whole new life.

167
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:21,075
Over this way we have the cafeteria.
All the meals are served there.

168
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:24,059
Uh Bradley! How about you
be Butters' accountabilibuddy?

169
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,240
"Humble yourselves therefore
under God's mighty hand,

170
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:28,077
that he may lift you up." Peter 5:6

171
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:31,615
Butters here is new to the camp. He's
chosen to rid himself of his affliction

172
00:08:31,616 --> 00:08:34,461
and forge a personal
relationship with Jesus Christ.

173
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:35,716
I'm bi-curious.

174
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,771
"Do not lie with a man
as one lies with a woman;

175
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:39,829
that is detestable." Leviticus 18:22

176
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,492
That's right, Bradley. I think
we're well on our way to being healed.

177
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:45,180
We've got another one: Room 22.

178
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:46,308
Aw, darnit!

179
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,853
-Aw man, I've got H O R S now.
-Okay, my turn.

180
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,958
WHERE IS IT, YOU FILTHY JEW?!

181
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,093
-Where's what?
-YOU KNOW GODDAMNED WELL WHAT!!

182
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:02,254
-Let go of me.
-What the hell are you doing, Cartman?

183
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:05,095
I went home to alter the picture
of me with Butters' penis in my mouth

184
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:06,657
to look like Kyle, but it was GONE!

185
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:08,399
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH MY PICTURE?!

186
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,048
Knock it off!
I don't have your stupid picture!

187
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,449
-Give it back, Kyle!
-I don't have it!

188
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,814
I swear to God, Kyle,
if you don't give it back right now,

189
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:17,819
I'm gonna break your
fuckin' Jew legs right here!

190
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,413
-Shut up!
-YOU SHUT UP!

191
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:22,294
You're lying,
and YOU two are covering up for him!

192
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,806
You know what?
You're just like Jews yourselves!

193
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:28,906
Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny,
you're a Jew! You're ALL JEWS!!

194
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:29,993
OW!

195
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:32,818
OW!! AAAAUH!

196
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:35,120
NYAAAAAAAAAA!

197
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:39,424
The Lord is love this for

198
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,100
With Jesus I can just say no

199
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:45,634
And not be confused anymore.

200
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:48,776
We will now hear a sermon
from Pastor Phillips.

201
00:09:48,777 --> 00:09:51,422
For those of you who are new to camp,
Pastor Phillips is somebody

202
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:54,020
who has broken free of
the bonds that afflict you.

203
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:55,437
He's bi-curious too?

204
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:59,122
Not anymore.
Because Pastor Phillips prayed,

205
00:09:59,123 --> 00:10:02,734
and by the hand of Jesus Christ,
he's now completely cured!

206
00:10:02,763 --> 00:10:05,673
Let's hear it for
Pastor Phiillips, kids!

207
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:08,808
Helloooo campers!

208
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,649
Yeth, believe it or not,
I mythelf used to have unclean urges,

209
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,551
and like a lot of you,
I thought I was just made that way,

210
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:19,446
that I didn't have a choice.

211
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:23,249
But then I realized that
God didn't want me to be that way!

212
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,038
God wanted me to be a man!

213
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:29,483
So I buckled up in my little suit and
I prayed to be normal and guess what??

214
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:30,984
It worrrrked!

215
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:35,817
That's right, kids. You see,
right now you're like a paper clip.

216
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:37,371
And just like a paper clip,

217
00:10:37,372 --> 00:10:42,218
God needs to bend you, and shape you,
and make youuuu... straight.

218
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,491
        

219
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,770
So you say you were robbed.

220
00:10:53,498 --> 00:10:58,309
Yes. A photograph. And I know who
took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!

221
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,293
If it's a photo, what's the big deal?

222
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:01,974
Why don't you just
print out another one?

223
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:06,445
It's a big deal, okay?! That picture
is my propertih, and I want it back!

224
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:08,596
Okay, what is the picture of?

225
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,384
Why... why does that matter?

226
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:15,892
Well how are we gonna find
your picture unless we know what it is?

227
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:18,443
All right. It's a picture... of me.

228
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:20,053
Yes?

229
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:22,433
It's a picture... of me.

230
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:28,874
And um... what appears to be...
a penis... in my mouth.

231
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:33,070
You were sucking somebody's penis.

232
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:35,381
No, no I was not! I was asleep,

233
00:11:35,606 --> 00:11:38,732
and this person just... puts a penis
in my mouth without me knowing!

234
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,390
And and took the picture!

235
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:42,338
-...I see.
-Yes.

236
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:45,328
Now it may appear in the picture...
that I'm actually looking

237
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,258
at the camera lens and smiling,
with the penis in my mouth.

238
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:52,287
And giving a thumbs up.
But I assure you, I was fast asleep!

239
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:55,677
Well we'd have to get a warrant first,
approved by a grand jury.

240
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:58,430
I don't have time for that!!
We have school tomorrow!

241
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:00,348
And I know that Kyle
is gonna show the picture

242
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:02,371
to everybody during Show and Tell!

243
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,197
Well then, you're screwed.

244
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:08,157
You both do understand that we're trying

245
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:11,098
to save your souls
from eternal life in Hell?

246
00:12:11,132 --> 00:12:12,182
Well sure, I guess.

247
00:12:12,183 --> 00:12:14,310
Only through Christ
can we cleanse our souls.

248
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:16,690
And you do know the rule which states

249
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:21,337
that no impure or immoral images
are allowed to be seen by the eye?

250
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:22,230
Well yeah, sure.

251
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:23,952
"So let's purify
ourselves from everything

252
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:26,194
that makes the body or soul
unclean." Corinthians, ch.7

253
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:29,337
Then do you mind telling
us why we found this

254
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:34,313
1979 Sears men's underwear catalog...
in your room?

255
00:12:36,164 --> 00:12:37,784
That's... that's mine.

256
00:12:38,264 --> 00:12:40,182
You know this is strictly forbidden!

257
00:12:40,183 --> 00:12:42,623
Ah I don't understand.
What's wrong with underwear?

258
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:47,334
What's wrong?! This is what
makes you confused! Don't you get it?!

259
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:50,290
This is confusing you right now,
isn't it?!

260
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,381
Yes, it's all VERY confusing!

261
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:54,929
This is just as much your fault,
Butters!

262
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,941
Bradley is your accountabilibuddy!
That makes you accountabilibuddyable.

263
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:02,030
Both of your boys'
behavior is jeopardizing

264
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,960
all of the work we're
doing here to save these kids!

265
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,820
Right. For having contraband
in your room, you will both do penance

266
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:19,855
by writing scripture
for the next four days!

267
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:24,552
That sonofabitch.
He's gonna show everyone that picture.

268
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,952
Only twelve hours from now.

269
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:30,821
That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm
gonna have to bring Mom in on this one!

270
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:34,075
I'm just...
going to have to tell her the truth.

271
00:13:34,076 --> 00:13:37,076
Ow. OW. OW!!

272
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,685
Eric? What's the, what's the matter?

273
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:46,881
I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.

274
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,150
Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened.

275
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:54,110
Kyle, has a picture of me,

276
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:56,416
and he's gonna show everyone
during Show and Tell,

277
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:59,910
and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.

278
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,112
Oh, now why would he do that?

279
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:06,347
Because, he's jealous of
how much smarter I am than him.

280
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:09,770
So, he's gonna show
everyone the picturrrre.

281
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:13,259
What is the picture of, Eric?

282
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:19,142
Last time, when Butters spent the night,
I was being really nice to him

283
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:23,125
and I was... gonna take a
picture of him for his mom to have.

284
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,867
Ohh, that's nice.

285
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:26,997
But then, right when I took the picture,

286
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:30,044
Butters got really hot,
so he pulled his pajama bottoms down,

287
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:33,932
and then I tripped, and, fell down,
and my mouth landed right on his penis,

288
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,738
and, then I thought of something funny,

289
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:38,621
so I smiled up at, the camera
and gave like a, thumbs up,

290
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:40,677
and, and then Kyle
took the picture from me,

291
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:46,371
and he's gonna show it to everybody,
and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay.

292
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,507
Oh, there there, sweetie.
It'll be okay. These things happen.

293
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,876
But, Mom, I've been trying
to get the picture back,

294
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:57,853
but he won't give it to meee.

295
00:14:57,884 --> 00:15:01,824
It's okay, Eric.
I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.

296
00:15:02,242 --> 00:15:03,659
You, you will?

297
00:15:04,807 --> 00:15:07,562
"...but that he loved
us and sent his only Son

298
00:15:07,563 --> 00:15:10,797
to be the satisfaction
of our sins." Neato!

299
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,135
Butters, I'm sorry for
getting you into trouble.

300
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,797
Awww, that's okay, Bradley.

301
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:18,034
I really want to get better. I try to do
everything the counselors say,

302
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:20,837
but some...how I still feel confused.

303
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,360
Yeah, well hopefully,
when we finish writin' all these verses,

304
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:26,372
we won't be bi-curious no more,
and then we can go home!

305
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:30,652
You're really terrific, Butters.
I mean, I think you're great.

306
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:31,553
Oh oh!

307
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,310
Oh God! Bad thought! Bad thought!

308
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:38,923
-Wuh-what's the matter?
-I think, I, I th-, I think I like you.

309
00:15:38,924 --> 00:15:40,839
Well I like you too, Bradley.

310
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,640
-You do??
-Wehyeah!

311
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,507
-You like like me?
-Sure, I like like you a lot a lot.

312
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:49,762
Oh God, we're both unfixable!
Don't you see we're lost causes?!

313
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:51,516
We're just evil and
nothing can change us!

314
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:55,406
There's no other way out, Butters!
We have to kill ourselves!

315
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:59,437
No! Bradley! You can't leave;
you're my accountabilibuddy!

316
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:05,068
Hello?

317
00:16:05,316 --> 00:16:08,226
Hello, Sheila?
It's Liane, Eric's mother.

318
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:10,039
Ohh, hello, Mrs. Cartman.

319
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:14,035
Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble
you with this, but apparently

320
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:18,463
your son has a picture of Eric
with another boy's penis in his mouth.

321
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:21,712
Excuse me?

322
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:26,949
Don't worry,
sweetie, everything is fine.

323
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,950
It is?? Really??

324
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:31,161
Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you!

325
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,147
You have nothing to worry
about in school tomorrow.

326
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:38,468
Mrs. Broflovski assured me
that Kyle doesn't have the picture.

327
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:39,671
What?

328
00:16:40,202 --> 00:16:42,801
She talked with her son
and says he doesn't have it.

329
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,132
Mom, she's lying!!

330
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:46,537
She said she was sure, Eric.

331
00:16:46,865 --> 00:16:50,540
Mom, you don't know anything about Jews!
They lie all the time!

332
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:54,201
Well, Eric,
there's nothing more I can do about it.

333
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:58,139
Then that's it. Kyle wins.

334
00:16:58,737 --> 00:17:01,044
But he won't win completely!
I'm going to print out

335
00:17:01,045 --> 00:17:04,526
another copy of that picture
and show it to the class myself!

336
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:07,683
I can at least rob
Kyle of his final laugh.

337
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:13,841
Do you mind telling me how you managed
to lose... your accountabilibuddy?!

338
00:17:14,341 --> 00:17:17,220
I went looking for 'im,
but he runs real fast.

339
00:17:17,221 --> 00:17:19,986
You don't seem to take
this camp seriously, Butters.

340
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:22,033
I've called your father in for a talk.

341
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,160
Oh no, my Dad?

342
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:26,946
Do you understand the concept of Hell?
Do you realize that if we don't fix you

343
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:29,845
you will burn in a
lake of fire for eternity?

344
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:33,078
Well yeah, but I just don't
quite understand what you're fixin'.

345
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:35,579
We're fixing your confusion!!

346
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,238
There you are, Butters!

347
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:39,664
-Oheh- hey Dad.
-What's he done now?!

348
00:17:39,665 --> 00:17:42,683
Mr. Stotch, your son is insubordinate,
unwilling to change,

349
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:45,954
and worse yet,
he's lost his accountabilibuddy!

350
00:17:46,174 --> 00:17:50,374
They found him! They found Bradley!
You'd better come quick!

351
00:17:57,014 --> 00:17:59,804
Oh Lord in Heaven! Don't jump, Bradley!

352
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:03,122
Stay-stay back!
I'm an abomination of God!

353
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,073
No no, we're fixing you!

354
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,473
Guess you think today
is your big day, huh Kyle?

355
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:15,203
To embarrass me in front of everyone?

356
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:18,979
Well guess what?
I'm not giving you the satisfaction!

357
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,449
Okay students, let's all take our seats.

358
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,158
Since it is Monday, we'll
start as always with Show And Tell.

359
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,829
Who'd like to go first?

360
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,102
Ow! Quit it, dude!

361
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:32,279
Okay Eric, Jesus, calm down.
You can go first.

362
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,180
HA!!

363
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:38,885
For Show And Tell today,

364
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:42,238
I would like to share with you some
very special, very artsy photographs

365
00:18:42,264 --> 00:18:46,080
I've taken in pursuit of
being a respected photographer.

366
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,608
This first picture I like
to call "Moods of Winter",

367
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,972
a simple aspen grove shot
in high-contrast black and white

368
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:54,656
shows the brittleness of the
trunks and reminds one... of death.

369
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:58,686
This picture I took
just as the sun was rising

370
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,463
and this lonely man was walking to work.

371
00:19:00,504 --> 00:19:02,625
A statement about...
all of our loneliness, perhaps?

372
00:19:02,626 --> 00:19:04,653
He isn't actually
going to show everyone...

373
00:19:04,654 --> 00:19:06,391
And now this next picture...

374
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:11,762
Don't jump, Bradley!
You will only make God angrier with you!

375
00:19:11,763 --> 00:19:12,853
It's too late.

376
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,321
Bradley, please.
You're my accountabilibuddy.

377
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,886
How will this make me look?

378
00:19:17,913 --> 00:19:19,975
You get back.
You're only gonna make things worse.

379
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:22,696
I'm not normal. I'll never be normal!

380
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:24,619
You're perfectly normal, Bradley.

381
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,419
Get back!
You're just as confused as he is!

382
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,645
All right. All right that does it!

383
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:33,656
I am sick and tired of
everyone telling me I'm confused!

384
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:38,599
I wasn't confused until other
people started tellin' me I was!

385
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:44,276
You know what I think? I think
maybe you are the ones who are confused!

386
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:45,177
Yeah.

387
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:49,523
I'm not gonna be confused anymore
just because you say I should be!

388
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:55,094
My name is Butters, I'm eight years old,
I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious!

389
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:59,007
And even that's okay!
Because if I'm bi-curious,

390
00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:01,372
and I'm somehow made from God,

391
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:05,418
then I think your GOD must
be a little bi-curious himself!

392
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:13,488
I think. I think I'd
like to come down now.

393
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:16,894
-He's coming down!
-We did it!

394
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,158
Through the power of Christ
we have saved this child!

395
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:23,584
Well Butters,
I guess we might as well go home.

396
00:20:23,585 --> 00:20:25,480
Looks like you're never gonna change.

397
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:27,424
No. I like bein' bi-curious.

398
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,375
Well you know somethin'?

399
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:30,913
So do I.

400
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,690
Wait. Now I am confused.

401
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:39,021
And this photograph I took
of a sunset near the power plant.

402
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:43,022
Note how the contrasting images make a
statement about our impact on the Earth.

403
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:47,002
Which brings us to
my last picture. Ahem.

404
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:51,052
This picture you may find somewhat...
controversial.

405
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:55,553
Eww!

406
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:57,244
Dude.

407
00:20:57,482 --> 00:21:01,038
Yes. This is shot at a 5.6
aperture using a low-light filter.

408
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,961
You can see the grain
from the high-speed film,

409
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,885
there's sort of a penis
in my mouth right here,

410
00:21:04,886 --> 00:21:07,252
and the low depth of field
keeps the background soft.

411
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,319
Eric, what the hell is this?!

412
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:12,180
What this is,
is a statement against the war in Iraq.

413
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:14,696
It's wrong that we still
have our troops there. It's WRONG!

414
00:21:14,697 --> 00:21:16,708
-And what I think that-
-Uh, Eric Cartman?

415
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,695
We got an emergency
message from your mother?

416
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:26,296
"Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have
it after all. Found it under your desk."

417
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:29,477
She said you'd know
what that means, m'kay?

418
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:40,686
...Lame.

419
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:45,158
