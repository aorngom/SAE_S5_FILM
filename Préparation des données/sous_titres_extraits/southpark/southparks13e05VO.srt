Season 13 Episode 5
"Fishsticks"

2
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,111
Hey, Jimmy, what are you up to?

3
00:00:37,236 --> 00:00:41,093
Hey, Eric. I was just trying to write
some new jokes for my comedy routine.

4
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:43,639
You wanna do something?
I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle,

5
00:00:43,764 --> 00:00:45,961
but they're pissed off at me,
so I hang out with you.

6
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,948
Sorry, but I really need to work.
I haven't written a good joke in a week.

7
00:00:50,073 --> 00:00:52,708
Maybe I can help you. We can
totally write some stuff together.

8
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:56,837
Well, sure. I've never tried working
with a partner, but let's give it a...

9
00:00:57,731 --> 00:00:58,936
shotsgarrooski.

10
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:03,065
Let's see. I was working on this.
Why does a squirrel swim on its back?

11
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:05,283
To keep his nuts dry.

12
00:01:06,954 --> 00:01:09,273
That's not that funny.
Let's try something else.

13
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:13,131
A fireman and a Pollack are
eating marshmallows when...

14
00:01:14,356 --> 00:01:16,638
Pollacks aren't that funny.
Try something else.

15
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:24,072
So the pope says:
"What are you, a stinking evolutionist?"

16
00:01:28,434 --> 00:01:31,652
Here's some fruit, boys.
Better for you than potato chips.

17
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,916
Look out.
There's a black widow!

18
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:38,021
Thanks, mom!
You might have saved my life!

19
00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:41,318
If I'm trying to be creative,
I can't eat fruit.

20
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:43,377
Doesn't your mom have
something more substantial?

21
00:01:43,502 --> 00:01:46,461
You can check the freezer. There might
be some frozen fishsticks or something.

22
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:47,923
If you like fishsticks.

23
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:50,838
- I like fishsticks.
- Wait a minute.

24
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:53,404
Fishsticks.
Fishsticks...

25
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:56,432
Oh, my God! It's so obvious!
How did I never think of it before?

26
00:01:56,557 --> 00:01:59,098
- What? You got something?
- Just run with me on this.

27
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:01,461
Say, Eric, do you like fishsticks?

28
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,637
You like putting fish dicks
in your mouth?

29
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:07,676
Well, what are you,
Eric, a gay fish?

30
00:02:09,346 --> 00:02:11,714
Fish dicks!
Dude, that's funny as shit!

31
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:15,202
I think we're really onto something
here. Let's try it out on the guys.

32
00:02:21,844 --> 00:02:24,626
- There's Clyde. Do it to Clyde.
- Let's do it to Clyde.

33
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:28,294
Check it out.
Hey there, Clyde.

34
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:30,020
- Hey.
- What's going on?

35
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:32,318
Eric and Jimmy came up with
the funniest joke ever!

36
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,254
Say, Clyde, do you like fishsticks?

37
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,049
You like to put
fish dicks in your mouth?

38
00:02:40,456 --> 00:02:42,556
What are you, Clyde, a gay fish?

39
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:46,457
You said you like fish dicks in
your mouth, that makes you a gay fish!

40
00:02:49,843 --> 00:02:51,480
Token, got a question for you.

41
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:55,973
- Token, do you like fishsticks?
- Fishsticks? Yeah, I guess so.

42
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,428
You like putting
fish dicks in your mouth?

43
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,083
What are you, a gay fish?

44
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,119
Look, there's Kevin Stoley!
Kevin, do you like fishsticks?

45
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:13,025
Hey, Mackey. Do you like fishsticks?

46
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:15,444
Fishsticks?
Yeah, I like fishsticks, m'kay.

47
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,739
- Peterson. Buying fishsticks, I see.
- Yeah, I like fishsticks.

48
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:21,367
What are you, Peterson, a gay fish?

49
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:25,788
<i>And now here he is, Jimmy Kimmel!</i>

50
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:29,270
All right,
how we all feeling tonight?

51
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:32,209
So let me ask the guys in
the audience a question.

52
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,088
Do you like fishsticks?

53
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,967
What are you? Gay fish?

54
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,432
And so, Paul,
do you like fishsticks, Paul?

55
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:48,519
- Sure.
- What are you, Paul, a gay fish?

56
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,195
More and more Americans are eating
fishsticks. You read about this?

57
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:01,297
Loving fishsticks.
Kind of makes me wonder, you know?

58
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:02,658
Is everybody a gay fish?

59
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,709
It is quite possibly
the funniest joke ever conceived,

60
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,549
and its origin is unknown.

61
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:19,398
The fishsticks joke crosses all borders,
all races, all ages and ethnic groups

62
00:04:19,523 --> 00:04:21,686
and is slowly uniting our country.

63
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:25,161
In fact, the only person
who appears to not get the joke

64
00:04:25,436 --> 00:04:29,435
is rapper Kanye West, who becomes
furious when the joke is used on him.

65
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:31,462
That is messed up!

66
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:34,773
I am not gay. And I sure
as hell ain't no fish, all right?

67
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:37,318
You really don't get it?

68
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:41,516
I'm a genius, all right. I'm the most
talented musician in the world.

69
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:44,366
If I was a homosexual or a fish,
I would know.

70
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,701
You're a rapper.

71
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:48,176
An entrepreneur.

72
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:50,673
And you like fish dicks.

73
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:54,544
- You're a gay fish.
- No, I'm not no gay fish.

74
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,794
Just gay?

75
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:59,006
I'm not gay and I'm not a fish. Man!

76
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,926
- You are male.
- Damn right I'm male.

77
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:06,388
- A male that likes fish dicks.
- Yeah, I like fishsticks.

78
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:10,225
You like to put fish dicks
in your mouth.

79
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,811
You're a gay fish.

80
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,036
All right, that does it.
I'm gonna kick your mother ass!

81
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,507
And then it was on Leno
and Jimmy Kimmel show!

82
00:05:21,632 --> 00:05:23,697
That's our joke on
national television!

83
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,491
We know, Cartman!

84
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:29,887
We are comedy writers
and you guys aren't.

85
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:35,703
Jimmy, I've been thinking.
We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.

86
00:05:35,828 --> 00:05:37,146
- Patent?
- Yeah, dude.

87
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,604
There's lots of people out there
using our joke on their shows.

88
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:42,106
- We should be getting compensated.
- Well, Eric,

89
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:44,838
that's really not how jokes work.
I mean, you know.

90
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:48,061
We should be happy that the joke
is so popular and made people laugh.

91
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:49,552
Fuck that!

92
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:52,434
Maybe you were writing for people's
amusement, but I don't work for free.

93
00:05:52,758 --> 00:05:55,195
I'm gonna talk to a lawyer
so we get what's coming to us.

94
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:03,084
What part of the fishsticks joke
did Cartman write?

95
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,780
Well, he didn't actually
write any of it.

96
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,451
He just...

97
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,006
Let me guess.

98
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:13,998
You wrote the joke and Cartman just
laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.

99
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:16,083
Actually, it was potato chips.

100
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,379
I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk
all over you. Stand up for yourself.

101
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:23,376
Well, I mean, he was in the room.

102
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,635
- Then just give him half.
- What?

103
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,967
I like you, Jimmy.
But you're not gonna win this.

104
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:32,433
Consider yourself lucky
he's only asking for half.

105
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:36,562
If Cartman didn't do anything,
he doesn't deserve any of the credit.

106
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,736
And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon.

107
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:42,458
No, dude, screw that!

108
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:46,143
If he didn't write the joke then
don't sign any patent papers with him!

109
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:49,324
Say: "Cartman, you didn't have anything
to do with this joke and you know it!"

110
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:52,249
Just give him half.

111
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,869
There are a lot of people out
there making up rumors about me

112
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:58,774
that are malicious and untrue.

113
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:02,299
But I am going to prove once
and for all I am not a fish.

114
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:05,615
Because I am a genius,
I have ascertained

115
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,634
that fish have gills.

116
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:11,847
Doctor, do I have gills?

117
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:15,976
He does not have gills.

118
00:07:17,197 --> 00:07:18,897
You hear that? No gills.

119
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:20,715
So I can't be a fish.

120
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,680
And I'm a genius voice of a generation,
so I'm not gay.

121
00:07:23,805 --> 00:07:26,346
So that is that.
All right, it's over.

122
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:28,322
Now, are there any questions?

123
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:32,618
- Do you like fishsticks?
- Love 'em.

124
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:34,880
You're a gay fish.

125
00:07:37,662 --> 00:07:38,762
No, I'm not!

126
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,083
All right. Recently,

127
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,683
recently, we've all come
to know the fishsticks joke

128
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:48,348
as probable the funniest,
most awesome joke ever.

129
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:50,602
But who originally came up with it?

130
00:07:50,727 --> 00:07:54,731
Here's your answer. Joining us tonight,
the brains behind the fishsticks joke,

131
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:56,558
the one and only Carlos Mencia.

132
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,438
So, Carlos, you've got a show
on comedy central, a stand-up tour.

133
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:06,063
Where did you have time
to come up with this classic joke?

134
00:08:06,188 --> 00:08:09,114
Well, you know, I was just kicking it
with my homies and my brain...

135
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,706
my brain is always so full of ideas,
'cause I'm so funny and stuff?

136
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:14,724
So I was all like,
hey, Pepito, you like fishsticks?

137
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:17,482
And my homeboy says,
"Carlos, you know, you're so funny."

138
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:20,415
And then it just occurred to me,
oh, man, you must be a gay fish, Holmes!

139
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,961
And that's just how I came up with it,
mi amigos!

140
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,110
Mother fucker!

141
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:33,051
Jimmy, dude! Did you see?

142
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:35,173
Carlos Mencia is taking
credit for our joke.

143
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:36,049
Really?

144
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:37,876
Yeah, dude.
I told you this would happen.

145
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:40,104
Now look, I got a lawyer
to draw up some patent papers.

146
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,399
We've got to sign these
so that people know that the joke

147
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:43,956
belongs to you and me.

148
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:47,776
I don't know, Eric. I really don't
think I want to sign that, very much.

149
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:52,249
But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking
credit for something he didn't do.

150
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:55,631
Well, to be perfectly frank, Eric.

151
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:00,289
I think I came up with a little bit more
of the joke than you did.

152
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,477
- What?
- Well, you know, I mean,

153
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,259
I basically wrote the thing
and you just kind of ate chips.

154
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,540
Jimmy, that's messed up.

155
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:11,343
We decided that day to write together.
Don't you remember?

156
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:16,085
- Hey, Jimmy, you wanna hang out?
- Sorry, but I gotta write some jokes.

157
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,854
Unless you wanna
team up or something?

158
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:19,909
Team up? OK.
Let's write some jokes together.

159
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:22,766
Here's some fishdicks, guys.
Hope you like fishdicks.

160
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:26,149
Do we like fishsticks?
What does she think we are, gay fish?

161
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:32,408
Oh, look out, Jimmy,
it's a black widow!

162
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,450
Wow! Thanks, Eric.

163
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,901
Is that, is that how it happened?

164
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,837
Look, exactly who came up with which
part of the joke isn't even relevant.

165
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,699
We had an agreement, Jimmy,

166
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:45,898
and if you wanna go
back on that now,

167
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:48,318
well, then you're
no better than a Jew.

168
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:50,339
I'm, I'm sorry.

169
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,191
It's cool, man. It's cool.

170
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,890
Here he is, y'all.
Give it up for Kanye West!

171
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:04,071
Yo uh.

172
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:06,007
Yo...

173
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:08,284
What the hell?

174
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:10,194
Gay fish!

175
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,970
Yo, fuck this noise. Yo!

176
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,532
It just doesn't make any sense, yo!

177
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:21,885
Why's everyone
calling me a gay fish?

178
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,328
Kanye, look, we all think it would
be better if you would just drop it.

179
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:27,960
You know, I mean,
if you don't get it, you don't get it.

180
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,029
What you mean I don't get it, house?
I'm a genius.

181
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:33,942
I'll understand it. I just need
to break it down is all.

182
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,677
Now let's see.
Something about fishsticks.

183
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:39,015
Interacting with me.

184
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:40,989
Makes me gay fish.

185
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,111
- Kanye, really...
- Shut up!

186
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,478
All right,
what do we know about fishsticks?

187
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:48,582
They're breaded.

188
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,460
They're fried.

189
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:51,835
They're frozen.

190
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:54,816
Then under me, we have rapper,

191
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:57,072
genius.

192
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,691
Gay fish are homosexual.

193
00:11:02,514 --> 00:11:03,514
They swim.

194
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:08,084
Is it because breaded
has something to do with

195
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,079
genius? Which swims?

196
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:14,297
No, because you said you like
fish dicks, Kanye. Don't you get it?

197
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,675
You see fish dicks
is a play on words.

198
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:19,110
I don't need anybody
telling me play on words.

199
00:11:19,235 --> 00:11:22,319
I'm a mother fucker lyrical
wordsmith mother fucher genius!

200
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:27,017
Hey, Kyle,
can I talk to you for a second?

201
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:29,292
Dude, get outta here. I'm peeing.

202
00:11:29,508 --> 00:11:32,185
It's just...
I don't know what to do about Jimmy.

203
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,296
I'm starting to think
he might try and Jew me out

204
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:36,266
of half of the fishsticks joke.

205
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:40,304
I just need you to teach me
some Jew defensive moves, Kyle.

206
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:43,029
Because we really did
both come up with it.

207
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:46,678
You know what, Cartman?
I believe you.

208
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:47,956
You do?

209
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:51,300
Yes. I believe that you believe
you helped write that joke.

210
00:11:51,425 --> 00:11:54,071
That's how people like you work.
Your ego is so out of whack

211
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:56,272
that it will do whatever
it can to protect itself.

212
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:59,474
And people with messed up ego
can do these mental gymnastics

213
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:03,551
to convince themselves they're awesome
when they're really just douche bags.

214
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:09,996
But I'm sure I helped come up
with the joke,

215
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:11,148
didn't I?

216
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:14,799
Hey, Jimmy, what's up, dawg?

217
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:16,801
Hey, Eric!
Just working on some jokes.

218
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:18,392
You wanna write some together?

219
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:20,599
That'd be great! I've always
wanted to work with you.

220
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:22,867
You're really funny
and you're totally not fat.

221
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,832
Cool, thanks. Let's get to work.
Now, let's see.

222
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,091
Something that's
a play on words. I don't know

223
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:30,203
fishsticks.
You know, 'cause of dicks.

224
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:31,955
You're really onto something there!

225
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,268
Hello, Eric, have some chips,
because you're totally not fat at all.

226
00:12:35,393 --> 00:12:38,645
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Valmer. Now,
let's see. The set-up could be

227
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:42,081
- "do you like fishsticks?"
- Right. And then I say "yeah."

228
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:44,828
So then I can say,
"what are you, a gay fish?"

229
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:46,515
Oh, wow! This is incredible!

230
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:50,086
- What is that?
- It's a dragon of some kind.

231
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:52,324
Don't worry, I can save you all!

232
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:59,729
Hey, look, Eric killed a dragon!

233
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:01,862
He's the most awesome kid in school!

234
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:04,549
- And he's not fat at all!
- Thanks, you guys!

235
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,185
Nope.

236
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:09,932
No, I definitely
helped write this joke.

237
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,499
All I can hope is Jimmy
doesn't try to Jew me over.

238
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,408
Is it perhaps that I'm fashionable

239
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:18,745
and fishsticks are crunchy?

240
00:13:19,947 --> 00:13:22,418
Yo, Kanye, Kanye!
We found 'em, money!

241
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:24,191
Found who?

242
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:27,270
You told us to track down whoever
started the whole fishstick thang.

243
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:29,045
We found out who, dawg.

244
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:34,354
C'mon, man! What is this, man?
What the fuck is going on, man?

245
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,066
Oh, fuck man. Kanye West.

246
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,499
Oh shit, no, oh, man.
OK, look it wasn't me.

247
00:13:41,624 --> 00:13:43,822
I didn't really start
the fishstick thing, all right?

248
00:13:44,343 --> 00:13:46,324
You just saying that now
'cause you're scared!

249
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:49,164
No, man, it's true! I stole it, man!

250
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:52,246
I took credit for it,
'cause I'm not actually funny.

251
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:54,688
C'mon, man.
Do you know what that's like?

252
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:57,377
Being a comedian
but not being funny?

253
00:13:58,016 --> 00:14:00,068
Come on, Kanye, I just take jokes

254
00:14:00,193 --> 00:14:02,883
and repackage them
with a Mexican accent man.

255
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,992
You think you can make fun of me?

256
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:08,346
I'm a genius! I'm the voice
of a generation! What are you?

257
00:14:08,787 --> 00:14:09,787
Nothing!

258
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:11,367
Look at me, man.

259
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:13,730
I'm not funny. I steal jokes,

260
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,681
my dick don't work, man.

261
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:18,856
I got to piss
in a plastic bag, man. I got no dick!

262
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:23,028
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I pay people to do that for me.

263
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:26,907
Oh shit, oh, no, man.
Come on, I got no dick, man.

264
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:36,424
Now, explain it to me.

265
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,614
Why do people think I'm a gay fish?

266
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,898
'cause, 'cause you like
fishsticks, man.

267
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,919
C'mon,
man. Don't you get it? Please,

268
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:49,133
just get it, man.

269
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:51,666
Why? Look at me. Look at me!

270
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:53,234
I love fishsticks.

271
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:55,842
I love putting
fishsticks in my mouth.

272
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:01,859
You're...
You're a gay fish, man.

273
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:07,156
Thank you very much!

274
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:11,993
About a week ago, our country
was blessed with the fishsticks joke.

275
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:13,684
And ever since then us comedians

276
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:15,956
have been kicking ourselves
for not thinking of it.

277
00:15:18,088 --> 00:15:21,950
But today, we have with us the true
creators of the fishsticks joke.

278
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,507
Please welcome the comedy team
of Cartman and Valmer!

279
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:30,176
Hey, guys!

280
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:32,848
Hi, Ellen.
You guys like fishsticks?

281
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:37,362
Thank you.
No, really. Thank you.

282
00:15:38,197 --> 00:15:39,421
So, guys, I gotta ask.

283
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:42,691
- How did you come up with this joke?
- It was just...

284
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:45,506
Comedy is like a game
of racquetball, you know?

285
00:15:45,756 --> 00:15:47,462
You serve,
the other person hits it back.

286
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:49,358
It bounces off the wall,
you back-hand it.

287
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,638
It goes back and forth, back and forth.
Then hopefully,

288
00:15:51,763 --> 00:15:53,577
you've got a good joke.
Thank you.

289
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:57,793
But, guys,
this joke is so... perfect.

290
00:15:58,043 --> 00:15:59,708
How could nobody think of it before?

291
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:02,404
Well, Ellen, the tru...

292
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:05,763
Truth of the matter is that there's
never really been a team like us before.

293
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:09,301
Let's be honest. Many people wouldn't
work with someone who's disabled.

294
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:13,541
But I see past that. I look beyond
Jimmy's disabilities and find a bond.

295
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,506
Which can unite us in comedy.

296
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:17,726
Working with crippled people
is really important.

297
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:21,449
That's so great.

298
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:24,392
- And are you crying, Jimmy?
- Yes, ma'am.

299
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:26,491
Don't cry, pal.
You're gonna get me started.

300
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:29,359
Anyway, what was important
for us, as a team,

301
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:32,301
was to make sure everyone knew
that we came up with the joke,

302
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:34,201
and not Carlos butthole Mencia.

303
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,455
I see.
And did you know

304
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,035
that Carlos Mencia was found dead
in his house this morning

305
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:41,604
with fishsticks stuffed down
his open neck hole?

306
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,660
Excuse me?

307
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:48,147
Get my jet ready.

308
00:16:48,397 --> 00:16:50,217
Looks like we got
another inning to play.

309
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:57,891
Check it out. We have
offers from Van de Kamp's

310
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,118
and Gorton's Fishermen
to do commercials.

311
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:02,908
It's always been my dream
to go on a national TV show

312
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:04,957
and talk about the craft of comedy.

313
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,038
Yeah, that was cool, huh?

314
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,782
Eric, there's something
I really need to know.

315
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:13,886
- What's that?
- How do you live with yourself?

316
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:16,973
You know you had nothing to do
with the fishsticks joke,

317
00:17:17,655 --> 00:17:19,006
but you just keep pretending.

318
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:21,665
How do you look at yourself
in the... fucking mirror?

319
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:23,249
That's what I want to know!

320
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:27,171
So. Here it is.

321
00:17:27,643 --> 00:17:29,715
How do you take credit
for something you didn't do?

322
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,683
That is bullcrap, and you know it!

323
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:34,386
I had just as much to do
with the fishsticks joke as you did!

324
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,684
- Dude, it's Puff Daddy!
- Tie up these motherfuckers!

325
00:17:42,953 --> 00:17:45,197
I'm gonna ask you motherfuckers
one more time.

326
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,941
Why did you start
these rumors about me?

327
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:50,517
Please! I wasn't
starting rumors about you.

328
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:51,904
I don't even know you!

329
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:55,699
Right. Everyone knows who I am!
I wanna know how this got started!

330
00:17:56,299 --> 00:17:58,323
We were just talking
about ideas for jokes and...

331
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:02,162
So now it's we? A minute ago,
you said you did it all yourself!

332
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:03,782
Well, I just... I...

333
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:07,943
We both came up with it together.
You wanna know how it happened?

334
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:12,510
- Hello, Jim.
- Oh, boy, it's my best pal, Eric!

335
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,667
- What you up to?
- I'm trying to write jokes,

336
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:16,595
but I'm not as funny as you,
so it's tough.

337
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,307
Maybe I can help you.
We can team up!

338
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,913
Really? You'd help me,
even though I'm crippled?

339
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:22,554
You are caring and not fat.

340
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,784
Let's see. How about a joke that has
something to do with fishsticks.

341
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:28,577
You know, 'cause fishsticks
sounds like fish dicks.

342
00:18:28,827 --> 00:18:31,594
Eric Cartman, you are handsome
and not even remotely fat.

343
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,856
Thanks.
So what I'm thinking is...

344
00:18:34,106 --> 00:18:36,017
Do you like fishsticks
in your mouth?

345
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:37,838
What was that?

346
00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:40,316
Eric, you have to save us!

347
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:42,496
An entire army of Jew robots!

348
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:50,401
Oh, my God!
What are Jew bots doing here?

349
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:51,651
Flame on!

350
00:18:58,016 --> 00:18:59,016
Flame off!

351
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:01,740
You saved everyone
from the Jew bots!

352
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,809
C'mon, Jimmy,
we gotta finish that joke!

353
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,166
... like fishsticks in your mouth?
What are you, a gay fish? There!

354
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,804
Eric! Incredible!

355
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:14,451
Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take
all the credit. Suck it, bitch.

356
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:18,747
Dammit. I guess it really
was all me who came up with it.

357
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:20,993
- What?
- Let Jimmy go. It's all my fault.

358
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:23,287
Jesus. He's gonna kill you!

359
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,297
You won't even admit it was just me
knowing you're gonna die?

360
00:19:27,193 --> 00:19:29,957
You really believe that you came up
with it all on your own?

361
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:32,928
Oh, my God. Wait.
I totally get it now.

362
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:34,882
What? I still don't get anything!

363
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:36,981
All this time I've been mad at you,

364
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:39,000
for trying to take
all the credit, but...

365
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,732
I realize that your ego has made you
believe things happened differently.

366
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,670
That's what Kyle was trying to tell me,
that you have such a huge ego

367
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,077
you do these mental gymnastics
to make yourself a part of things.

368
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:50,863
Really?

369
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:53,869
I thought you were trying
to Jew me out of my part of the credit,

370
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,488
but now I realize that some people
just have egos that are so out of whack

371
00:19:57,973 --> 00:19:59,693
that no matter what people tell them

372
00:19:59,943 --> 00:20:01,867
they can't accept
the truth of who they are.

373
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:04,054
Jimmy, I owe you an apology.

374
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:07,483
I realize now you can't help
believing you created the entire joke,

375
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:10,061
because your ego
won't let you think otherwise.

376
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:11,668
I just have to accept that.

377
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:15,105
Thanks, Eric.
For being so understanding.

378
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:16,355
He's right.

379
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:19,475
For so long I've considered myself
God's gift to the world, that I...

380
00:20:19,725 --> 00:20:21,708
couldn't take it
when people made fun of me.

381
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,720
But they weren't making fun of me.

382
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,432
They were trying to help me.

383
00:20:26,553 --> 00:20:27,893
I understand what you did.

384
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:31,624
Untie them, guys.
I know what I have to do.

385
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:36,277
Yo, Kanye, you sure about this?

386
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:39,947
It's time for me to stop running.
I need to believe what people tell me.

387
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:42,826
Let all my fans know I love 'em,

388
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,577
but a gay fish just can't live
in the outside world forever.

389
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:49,549
Don't be sad for me, guys.
I'm going home!

390
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:57,986
<i>I've been so lonely, girl
I've been so saddened down</i>

391
00:20:58,236 --> 00:21:00,638
<i>Couldn't understand
Why others joked around</i>

392
00:21:00,888 --> 00:21:03,433
<i>I wanted to be free
With other creatures like me</i>

393
00:21:03,683 --> 00:21:05,276
<i>And now I got my wish</i>

394
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,397
<i>'cause I know that I'm a gay fish</i>

395
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:11,721
<i>Motherfuckin' gay fish</i>

396
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:14,527
<i>Going on a gay fish</i>

397
00:21:15,545 --> 00:21:17,459
<i>Makin' love to other gay fish</i>

398
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,195
<i>All those lonely nights
At the grocery store</i>

399
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,073
<i>In the frozen fish aisle
Feeling like a whore</i>

400
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,756
<i>‘cause I wasn't being true
Even though everyone said</i>

401
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:27,285
<i>That I had to make a switch</i>

402
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,610
<i>Now I know that I'm a gay fish</i>

403
00:21:31,672 --> 00:21:33,792
<i>Motherfuckin' gay fish</i>

404
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:36,461
<i>Going on a gay fish</i>

405
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:38,616
