La Fabrique

2
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,662
I've got more friends than Kyle!

3
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,583
How the hell do you have
more friends than me?

4
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,293
'cause people think I'm cool.

5
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,795
- How many do you have, Kenny?
- <i>63.</i>

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,548
What?
How do I only have 37 friends?

7
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,009
You guys doing
that stupid Facebook stuff again?

8
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,594
Stupid Facebook stuff!

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,638
Why are you wasting your time?
We're supposed to play video games!

10
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,391
You don't get how cool
Facebook has become.

11
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,685
You can message your friends,
play Yahtzee,

12
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,104
even start your virtual farm
and have your friends visit it!

13
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,231
Who wants to play Yahtzee?

14
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,275
We know it's hard to get started,
but we have a surprise for you.

15
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,279
We made you
your own Facebook page!

16
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,448
Surprise!

17
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,201
I told you
I don't wanna be on Facebook!

18
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,453
But now you can be friends
with all of us!

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,081
I won't collect friends
or build any farms.

20
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,540
I won't get sucked into this!

21
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,918
All right.
You don't have to add any friends.

22
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,544
You can be like Kip Drordy.

23
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,463
- Who?
- Kip Drordy, the third grader.

24
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,048
He's got no Facebook friends.

25
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,258
And he's had a profile
for more than six months!

26
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,386
That's so sad.

27
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,679
Everyone should have
one Facebook friend.

28
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,099
You guys are retarded.
I'm playing Xbox.

29
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,894
There's really people out there
without a Facebook friend?

30
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,354
That's so wrong.

31
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,075


32
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,548


33
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,180


34
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,781
Mom, Dad!
I made a friend today!

35
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,658
- Kip! Really?
- You did?

36
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,204
- Son, that's wonderful!
- What's his name?

37
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,539
Kyle Broflovski!

38
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,416
He's a student and his interests
include video games and reading!

39
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,002
Is he a nice boy?

40
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,503
He's the best!

41
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,756
He has a green hat and he wants
the world to stop talking about ninjas!

42
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,259
I'll tell him what I'm thinking about!
What am I currently thinking about?

43
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,771
I was on my computer at work
and saw you have a Facebook page?

44
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,899
I was kinda forced to.

45
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,444
Are you gonna add me as a friend?

46
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,323
I really don't want
to get more into it.

47
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,830
I'm not your friend, then?

48
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,291
Dad, you are my friend.

49
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,044
But you don't want
to add me as a friend.

50
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,963
It's a stupid click of a button
that takes two seconds.

51
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,008
Right, but you don't have
the two seconds or...

52
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,886
- I just want to do my homework.
- All right, fine.

53
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,850
Just to be clear,
you and I are not friends?

54
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,769
- All right, I'll add you!
- Cool!

55
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,899
Mom, Dad!
My best friend, Kyle,

56
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,610
he went to the dentist yesterday
and got two fillings!

57
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,488
And today he's wondering
if <i>Hurt Locker</i> deserved the Oscar!

58
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,906
That's great, Kip!

59
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,327
- They are getting to know each other.
- It's amazing.

60
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,830
You know Kip
spent the morning at the boy's farm?

61
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,498
His friend lives on a farm?

62
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,458
Think I'll add some more pigs.

63
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,379
Maybe I should put in
another field of corn there.

64
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,130
There we go!
Nice.

65
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,136
29?
No, I have 30 friends...

66
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,265
What the hell is...

67
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:27,976
Shit!

68
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,232
Am I a joke to you?

69
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,736
- What?
- Is that all I am? A big joke?

70
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,742
You do have a Facebook page!

71
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,246
- I just got that because Kyle...
- I saw your page.

72
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,039
Relationship status?
Single?

73
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,084
- I didn't even pay any attention to...
- You like being single?

74
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,502
So that you can use Facebook
to find other girls?

75
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,798
According to your Facebook page,
we aren't friends.

76
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,342
All right.
I'll add you as a friend. Sorry!

77
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,679
And you better change your status
to in a relationship!

78
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,057
- How?
- By editing your basic information!

79
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,809
I'm sorry!

80
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,770
Edit profile.

81
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,815
Basic settings.
Jesus Christ!

82
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,736
Why won't you be friends
with grandma?

83
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,863
I don't want to pay attention...

84
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,783
She's in the hospital,
and you won't be friends with her!

85
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,660
All right, I'll add grandma.

86
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,078
That's better.

87
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,040
And I sent you a funny picture,
and you didn't respond to it.

88
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,501
Fuck Facebook, seriously.

89
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,420
What the hell is this?
Podcast?

90
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,215
<i>Welcome
to Cartman's incredible podcast!</i>

91
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,677
Hello fellow, Facebookers.
I'm here to do one thing:

92
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,262
get you more friends!

93
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,725
Looking around Facebook today,
we see that since adding loser Kip,

94
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,810
Kyle Broflovski's stock
is plummeting.

95
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:56,064
He had 55 friends just two days ago.
He's down to just 11 this morning.

96
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,274
Run to your Facebook account
and delete Kyle

97
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,569
because he is poison
and won't make a comeback soon!

98
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,031
You'll want to dump Kyle
and if possible add Clyde Donovan.

99
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,783
Why?
Birthday!

100
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,284
His birthday is coming up,

101
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,079
and his mom is taking everyone
to Casa Bonita.

102
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:15,500
You'll want to add him.
His numbers are going way up.

103
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,834
Now, word on the street!

104
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,586
<i>Word on the street!</i>

105
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,715
Rumors becoming more than that:
Jimmy and Bebe sharing their friends!

106
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,551
- That's right, we're having a merger!
- <i>Merger!</i>

107
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,346
If you're a friend of Jimmy's,
you'll luck into 90 chick friends.

108
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,599
And as we all know, chick friends
are worth triple what dude friends are.

109
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,394
That's all for today.
Remember, update that profile

110
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,936
and steer clear of Kyle!

111
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,359
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

112
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,240
What's the matter?

113
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,660
I don't have any friends.

114
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,454
What?

115
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,498
I mean I do, but...

116
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,835
Ever since I became friends
with that Kip Drordy kid

117
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,379
a bunch of my other friends
have started ignoring me.

118
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,549
It would be fine
except my farm is starting to shrink.

119
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,594
I should just dump Kip as a friend,
but that's terrible to do, and...

120
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,640
Sorry, I'm just so confused.
I really need a friend right now.

121
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,558
Okay, I'm here for you.

122
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,937
So then go get on Facebook
and fertilize my crops?

123
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,650
My farm hasn't expanded
in three days!

124
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,988
I already had to add all of Wendy's
and my grandma's friends.

125
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,449
I won't start doing the farming stuff!
I'm not getting sucked into that!

126
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,203
You don't get sucked into it!
You don't get sucked in at all!

127
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,957
Fuck!

128
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,880
- It says I'm at your farm.
- Click on the little soil button.

129
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,425
And then maybe put a sign up
to comment on my farm.

130
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,636
Now I can read the sign you put up.

131
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,391
It says you and I
are now very good friends.

132
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,270
We're very good friends, Stan!

133
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,692
You spend more time
with your buddy Kyle today?

134
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,236
Yeah, Dad!
We've been having the best time!

135
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,740
I showed him all the pictures of me
in that Halloween costume last year!

136
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,574
What'd he say about those?

137
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,619
He laughed out loud,
then was rolling on the floor laughing!

138
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,746
Sounds like you boys had a ball!

139
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,248
Mom, Dad, I'm all done.

140
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,792
Can hang out with Kyle
and tell him what I had for dinner?

141
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,086
It's a little late,
but it is Friday.

142
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,797
I think the more time
you spend with your friend the better.

143
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,342
Have fun and be safe!

144
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,684
Ate pork chop for dinner,

145
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,145
had nice apple sauce too!

146
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,214
"I think you look cute
in your bunny costume."

147
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,216
What?

148
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,635
"Cute in your bunny costume?"
What is that supposed to mean?

149
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,054
No idea!

150
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,683
That's what Susan92
wrote on your Facebook wall!

151
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,768
You give girls
pictures of you in bunny outfits?

152
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,894
Fuck you!

153
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,857
Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's
and she's 92 years old!

154
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,489
I'm your friend Brian
through your uncle Jimbo.

155
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,242
I commented on your status,
but haven't heard back from you.

156
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,369
Could you give me
a poke sometime soon?

157
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,662
Fine.

158
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,875
Kid, how come you ignored
my friend request?

159
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,461
I don't know you!

160
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,464
I'm just a guy
that gets ignored, I guess!

161
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,403
Grandma said she poked you
and you haven't sent a poke back.

162
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,823
- I didn't even want to do...
- Poke your grandma!

163
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,038
Screw this!

164
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,291
Edit profile.
Update profile.

165
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,084
There!
Delete profile.

166
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,879
"You've asked to delete your profile,
if this is an error hit cancel."

167
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,340
Proceed.

168
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,383
"Delete your profile, are you sure?"

169
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,427
"Totally sure?"

170
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,390
<i>I'm afraid I can't let you do that,
Stan Marsh.</i>

171
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,269
Can't let me do that?
What?

172
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,272
<i>I'm gonna have to put you
on the game grid.</i>

173
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,358
Delete profile.

174
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,777
"Are you totally sure?"
God dammit, yes!

175
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,195
Delete!

176
00:10:59,033 --> 00:10:59,908
Dad?

177
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:03,912
Dad?

178
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,773
What the fuck?

179
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,568
- All right get moving, profile.
- Profile?

180
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,569
- I'm not a profile!
- Ignore.

181
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,117
Tom Davis says hello
to Linda Green's profile!

182
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,286
Linda Green likes how Tom Davis
has changed his status.

183
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,997
- Excuse me, my name is...
- Ignore.

184
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,250
- Could you tell me how...
- Ignore.

185
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,793
God dammit.
I got sucked into Facebook!

186
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,713
I don't know what to do.

187
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,674
I just can't seem
to get my friend numbers to go up.

188
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,134
I'm desperate.

189
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,136
That's why I came to you.

190
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,888
You're very smart.

191
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,183
But as long as you have
that Kip Drordy loser as a friend,

192
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,269
people view
your friendship as a liability.

193
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,396
- Dump him.
- I can't do that. I just feel too bad.

194
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,483
Then go outside the normal circles

195
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,735
and make friends
with people who've never heard of Kip.

196
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,279
I've been trying!

197
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,947
But I don't know how to make
new friends on the Internet.

198
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,117
It's not as hard as it sounds.
Have you ever heard of Chatroulette?

199
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,287
What's Chatroulette?

200
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,290
Finding new friends
is easier than ever.

201
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,916
We set ourselves up on webcam.

202
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,251
And the computer
will randomly put us

203
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,172
with one of the 50,000 people online
also doing Chatroulette.

204
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,757
That's kinda cool.

205
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,217
Let's see
who our first chat partner is.

206
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,343
Connect.

207
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,721
That's some dude jacking off!

208
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,349
You get those sometimes.
We just click to the next person.

209
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,475
There we go.

210
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,561
- That's just a guy's penis too!
- Let's try this one.

211
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,731
I don't wanna see
a bunch of guy's penises!

212
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,857
Hold on!

213
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,276
This is an amazing
gathering place where people

214
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,195
can share their thoughts and ideas!

215
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,907
That's a dude jacking off...

216
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,993
Dude jacking off...
Penis...

217
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,579
Here's a guy.

218
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,582
How's it goin'?

219
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,877
This my friend Kyle.
He's looking for some new friends.

220
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,590
He's taking out his penis.
Next guy.

221
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,592
Screw this.
I don't wanna see anymore!

222
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,219
That's the way the world works!

223
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,388
If you wanna find some quality friends,
you can wade through all the dicks!

224
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,601
Excuse me.

225
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,686
Could you please tell me
what is going on?

226
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,522
You aren't my friend.
Would you like to be my friend?

227
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,441
I don't want anymore friends.

228
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,776
Ignore.

229
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,154
Anyway, I really like taking
long walks in the summer.

230
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,406
I'll be your friend.

231
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,367
Confirm.

232
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,873
Tom Davis is thrilled to have
become powerful by adding a friend!

233
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,500
Some pictures of my dog.

234
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,045
And here he is in some silly outfits.
Can you comment on these?

235
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,048
Move it, profile!

236
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,424
Why?

237
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,427
They're taking him
to the gaming arena.

238
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,428
Looks like
I'm gonna be down a friend.

239
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,851
You are about
to face each other in combat!

240
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,938
You will play the game
for the amusement of the users.

241
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,070
Let the game commence!

242
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,329
Yahtzee?

243
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,664
One round only!
Begin!

244
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,674
I'm gonna count fives, my five box.

245
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,969
Can't we play
on speeder bikes or something?

246
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,220
Play, profile!

247
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,099
Yahtzee.

248
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,399
Dude jacking off...

249
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,901
Dude jacking off...

250
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,653
That's a dude jacking off.

251
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,488
That's it.
I'm outta here!

252
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,782
Chatroulette is no way for me
to find new friends!

253
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,868
Wait!
Here's a nice little Jewish kid!

254
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,454
Hi, there!

255
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,080
Nice to meet you.

256
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,416
- My friend Kyle is a Jew too!
- <i>That's cool.</i>

257
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,127
<i>I was starting to think this was nothing
but dudes jacking off.</i>

258
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,838
Do you wanna be Facebook friends?

259
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,965
<i>Sure, if you'll come
and visit my farm.</i>

260
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,467
I'll visit your farm.
You should check mine out too!

261
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,138
Honey, where's Kip?
I haven't seen him all day.

262
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,183
He's been out spending the day
with his best friend Kyle.

263
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,268
I think they're at the movies now.

264
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:53,994
Troublemaker!

265
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,871
You were not supposed
to survive the game of Yahtzee!

266
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,083
You have made things complicated!

267
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,585
I've made them complicated?
I don't even want to be here!

268
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,920
That's not what your profile said.

269
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,297
My profile?

270
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,050
My Facebook profile
has taken on a life of its own!

271
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,134
Where is it?

272
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,471
Your profile is one
of the most powerful.

273
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,264
You cannot stop it now.

274
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,100
I can try.

275
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,312
After him!

276
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,567
I fed the pigs.

277
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,821
Now I definitely should water
some fields.

278
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,699
That Jewish kid
put up a sign on my farm!

279
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,035
"Hey, Kyle.
Really like your farm."

280
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,286
Awesome!

281
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,205
What is that?

282
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,750
<i>You're an asshole!</i>

283
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:43,836
What?

284
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,297
<i>What did I tell you?
I didn't want to get sucked into it!</i>

285
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,673
<i>This is your fault!</i>

286
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,052
What are you doing?

287
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,512
<i>What's it look like?</i>

288
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,265
<i>I found your farm on Facebook,
help me deal with this bullshit!</i>

289
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,183
<i>Check my profile status.</i>

290
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,726
Profile status?

291
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,271
<i>Bring up my Facebook page
and see what it says my status is!</i>

292
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,858
I have to harvest my crops
before it's too late.

293
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,777
<i>Fuck your crops!</i>

294
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,364
Stop!
I'm sorry!

295
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,492
It says that you are currently

296
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,329
hosting an online chat party
for all your friends.

297
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,996
- <i>Where?</i>
- Café World.

298
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,582
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

299
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,003
An online chat party
for all his friends?

300
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,671
I should get over there!

301
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,927
Jesus Christ!

302
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,641
Randy Marsh is at work right now.
Work is boring!

303
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,227
Randy Marsh is at work right now.
Work is boring!

304
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,897
Butters Stotch is enjoying
Stan's chat party!

305
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,315
Herbert Garrison
likes Butter's comment!

306
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,611
Grandma Marsh would like
to be friends with Kevin Donohue.

307
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,572
Kevin Donahue accepts
grandma Marsh's friendship!

308
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,283
Has anybody seen my stupid profile?

309
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,703
Susan92 has pictures of Stan
in a bunny costume!

310
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,247
Gary Johnson thinks
the pictures are fantastic!

311
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,792
There's a lot of profiles here!

312
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,836
Kyle Broflovski is amazed
Stan has so many Facebook friends!

313
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,924
Kyle Broflovski is amazed Isayah
is also a Facebook friend of Stan's!

314
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,385
Isayah Zordon is deleting
Kyle Broflovski as a friend.

315
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,511
Why?

316
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,180
User saw you're friends with Kip
who only has one friend.

317
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,057
Kyle Broflovski is bad friend stock.

318
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,935
- I'm not really friends with him.
- Ignore.

319
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,227
That does it!

320
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,398
All right, enough!
Everybody just shut up!

321
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,318
Where is profile Stan Marsh?

322
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,113
Right here.

323
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,332
I'm sorry, Kip,
but I can't be your friend anymore.

324
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,876
It was a great ride,
but I must say goodbye.

325
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,504
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do,

326
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,090
but ending a friendship
is never easy.

327
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,220


328
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,430


329
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,422
What do you want from me?

330
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,091
I'm your profile.

331
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,845
And as you can see,
I am much more powerful than you.

332
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,305
I should have deleted you
a long time ago!

333
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,975
Why do you think
I brought you in here?

334
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,186
The fact of the matter
is I'm up and running now

335
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,146
with almost a million friends.

336
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,814
I don't need you anymore.

337
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,650
I have more friends
than you'll ever have in the real world.

338
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:54,818
Who cares?

339
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,904
Friends shouldn't be some kind
of commodity for a person's status!

340
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,158
Who is more powerful,
the user or the profile?

341
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,034
Let's end this once and for all.

342
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,793
Let the final battle begin!

343
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,761
Fucking Yahtzee again?
Seriously?

344
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,063
What did I tell you!

345
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,065
That's a large flush already!

346
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,900
You don't have a chance in here, user!
You pathetic little...

347
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,069
Yahtzee.

348
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,196
- What?
- Yahtzee. Sixes.

349
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,490
Can't be!

350
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,867
Yahtzee!

351
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,471


352
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,474
Thank God.

353
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,478
My computer says
we're not friends anymore?

354
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,356
My Facebook profile went rogue.

355
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,650
Had to go into the circuitry
and do battle with it.

356
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,902
I sent all my friends
somewhere else.

357
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,073
So we're not friends then?

358
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,741
Fuck off, Dad.
