- Howdy-ho, you South Parketeers.[br]- Howdy-ho!

00:00:08.05,00:00:11.50
- I'm rootin'-tootin' Trey.[br]- I'm pistol-slinging Matt.

00:00:11.68,00:00:15.62
- This here's Scratch. Say hi, fella.[br]- Hi, Scratch!

00:00:15.79,00:00:20.82
We're right excited about this next[br]episode because it's our favorite one.

00:00:20.99,00:00:24.76
It's called "Starvin' Marvin,"[br]and it aired on Thanksgiving.

00:00:24.93,00:00:28.76
In it, the boys celebrate[br]the holiday with a visitor.

00:00:28.93,00:00:32.80
When Comedy Central asked us[br]to do a Thanksgiving special...

00:00:32.97,00:00:38.00
...my first thought was, "I'd like[br]to have sex with Jennifer Aniston."

00:00:38.21,00:00:43.77
Cup her perky breasts in my hands and[br]put my hand on her nice, tight buns.

00:00:43.98,00:00:47.18
This episode teaches[br]racial tolerance...

00:00:47.35,00:00:50.95
...to treat everyone equally,[br]regardless of skin color.

00:00:51.12,00:00:55.18
It's our Indian friend[br]Indian Companion. Say hi, kids.

00:00:55.36,00:01:00.30
- What's happening, Indian Companion?[br]- Something coming. Grizzly bear.

00:01:00.47,00:01:06.13
Why don't you go over and kick him[br]in the balls? Grizzly bears like that.

00:01:07.91,00:01:09.70
- Dumb-ass.[br]- He's so stupid.

00:01:09.91,00:01:13.50
Y'all sit back and have[br]a rootin'-tootin' good time...

00:01:13.68,00:01:16.41
...with "Starvin' Marvin." Yee-haw!

00:01:18.72,00:01:21.12
Hooray!

00:01:53.35,00:01:55.18
Starvin' Marvin

00:01:58.86,00:02:02.69
- That was awesome.[br]- Would you boys like Cheesy Poofs?

00:02:02.86,00:02:06.09
Move! The Terrance & Phillip[br]Thanksgiving Special is on.

00:02:06.26,00:02:08.53
- Sure.[br]- Yeah, we want Cheesy Poofs.

00:02:08.70,00:02:12.14
Terrance, looks like a good place[br]to start a colony.

00:02:12.30,00:02:16.47
It sure does, Phillip. No one[br]will repress our religion here.

00:02:19.31,00:02:23.04
- You stained my hat![br]- Did you see that? That was sweet.

00:02:23.22,00:02:27.85
Coming up next on the special,[br]Phillip farts on Terrance and laughs.

00:02:28.02,00:02:30.28
- Cool![br]- Now a word from our sponsor.

00:02:30.46,00:02:35.86
In Africa, children are dying, not[br]from disease or war but from hunger.

00:02:36.03,00:02:39.79
I'm Sally Struthers.[br]These children are in desperate need.

00:02:39.97,00:02:42.43
- Who's that fat chick?[br]- Sally Struthers.

00:02:42.60,00:02:44.16
She was on Full House.

00:02:44.34,00:02:48.20
Here in the middle of Africa,[br]food is extremely scarce.

00:02:48.37,00:02:50.86
She's not having[br]trouble finding food.

00:02:51.04,00:02:53.60
- She's fatter than Cartman.[br]- Yeah. Hey!

00:02:53.78,00:02:59.08
- Just $5 a month can sponsor a child.[br]- That's stupid. Who'd want to do that?

00:02:59.25,00:03:04.19
Sponsor now, and we'll send you[br]a Teiko sports watch as a free gift.

00:03:04.36,00:03:06.65
- Kick-ass![br]- Sweet!

00:03:06.86,00:03:11.26
- I know my mom's credit-card number.[br]- Is it waterproof?

00:03:11.43,00:03:15.16
- Hello, is this Sally Struthers?[br]- What did she say?

00:03:15.33,00:03:17.89
- Shut up, butt pirate![br]- Ass-rammer.

00:03:18.07,00:03:22.56
- We wanna adopt a starving Ethernopian.[br]- When do we get the watch?

00:03:22.74,00:03:25.73
- Just a second, fat-ass![br]- You vas deferens.

00:03:26.08,00:03:29.01
Hello? No, it's a... Vas deferens?

00:03:32.18,00:03:36.52
- Ask if we get the watch right away.[br]- Do we get the watch right away?

00:03:36.69,00:03:38.18
- She says we do.[br]- Cool.

00:03:38.36,00:03:39.98
I get to wear it first.

00:03:41.86,00:03:46.23
- I can't wait to get our Teiko watch.[br]- But I get to wear it first.

00:03:46.40,00:03:51.73
To honor this special time of year,[br]we'll be doing a canned-food drive.

00:03:51.94,00:03:55.74
Anybody know what a[br]canned-food drive is? Yes, Eric.

00:03:55.91,00:03:59.64
When they cut up a chick's stomach[br]to get a baby out?

00:03:59.81,00:04:01.64
That's a cesarean section.

00:04:01.81,00:04:06.01
That's okay. There are no stupid[br]questions, just stupid people.

00:04:06.18,00:04:11.12
It's when we collect food for people[br]who can't afford food on Thanksgiving.

00:04:11.29,00:04:13.45
- You mean like Kenny?[br]- Exactly.

00:04:13.63,00:04:17.76
Mr. Garrison, why do poor people[br]always smell like sour milk?

00:04:17.96,00:04:20.69
I don't know, Eric. They just do.

00:04:21.23,00:04:23.93
I want everyone[br]to bring a can of food.

00:04:24.10,00:04:29.04
The mayor will divide it up amongst[br]Kenny's family and other poor people.

00:04:29.21,00:04:33.97
- I won't bring food. Screw them![br]- How about helping the less fortunate?

00:04:34.15,00:04:38.45
Do you hear something?[br]I think I hear flower children calling.

00:04:38.65,00:04:43.09
This is the one time of year[br]to care about people who can't eat.

00:04:43.26,00:04:47.78
Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?[br]What about the poorhouses I pay for?

00:04:47.96,00:04:50.43
Many would rather die than go there.

00:04:50.60,00:04:53.53
They should,[br]and decrease the population.

00:04:53.70,00:04:56.10
That's enough Dickens for one day.

00:04:56.27,00:05:00.00
- On with our lesson, right, Mr. Hat?[br]- Right, Mr. Garrison.

00:05:00.17,00:05:05.04
Engelbert Humperdinck was the first[br]man on the moon. Who was the second?

00:05:08.88,00:05:11.01
What the hell is going on?

00:05:20.09,00:05:22.15
You don't see that every day.

00:05:24.10,00:05:27.39
Now, once we have all[br]the canned foods collected...

00:05:27.60,00:05:30.66
...we'll need some clever way[br]to distribute them to the poor.

00:05:30.84,00:05:33.10
It should be something festive.

00:05:33.27,00:05:35.97
Mayor, we've got a very big problem.

00:05:36.14,00:05:39.08
You're that insane[br]genetic engineer, right?

00:05:39.24,00:05:41.97
Yes, and I may have made[br]a horrible mistake.

00:05:42.15,00:05:46.24
I was genetically engineering[br]turkeys for Thanksgiving...

00:05:46.42,00:05:48.55
...to provide food for the needy.

00:05:48.82,00:05:52.02
Something went wrong,[br]the turkeys broke free.

00:05:52.19,00:05:55.59
The worst part is,[br]they're really pissed off.

00:05:55.79,00:05:57.35
Naturally.

00:05:58.90,00:05:59.99
Oh, do go on.

00:06:00.20,00:06:04.66
We have to stop them, or they could[br]destroy everything. Time is short.

00:06:07.47,00:06:11.31
- You were saying?[br]- They act normal, but they're evil.

00:06:11.48,00:06:13.14
Oh, my.

00:06:17.38,00:06:21.41
- You're not taking me seriously.[br]- Why would you say that?

00:06:23.92,00:06:25.58
- Did it come?[br]- Is it here?

00:06:25.76,00:06:28.19
I get to use it first, you guys.

00:06:28.49,00:06:32.99
- Did our digital sports watch come?[br]- Not yet, hon.

00:06:33.20,00:06:35.19
- Damn.[br]- Hey, look, you guys.

00:06:35.37,00:06:40.00
Now back to part two of The Terrance[br]& Phillip Thanksgiving Special.

00:06:40.17,00:06:43.30
- I sure am cold, Phillip.[br]- Yes, and hungry too.

00:06:43.48,00:06:48.64
- Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass.[br]- Gosh, I hope we don't starve.

00:06:49.55,00:06:50.81
A squeaker!

00:06:55.79,00:06:58.48
The digital sports watch is here!

00:07:02.19,00:07:03.35
What the hell?

00:07:03.56,00:07:08.12
- That's not a digital sports watch.[br]- It looks like an Etheropian.

00:07:08.30,00:07:11.57
They accidentally sent him[br]instead of the watch.

00:07:11.74,00:07:15.67
Maybe they took it literally[br]when we said we'd adopt a kid.

00:07:16.78,00:07:20.23
- That was cool.[br]- How'd he make those clicking sounds?

00:07:20.41,00:07:22.14
What's your name, dude?

00:07:22.35,00:07:26.51
- I think he said his name is Marvin.[br]- Yeah, Starvin' Marvin.

00:07:26.69,00:07:28.41
Nice to meet you.

00:07:28.59,00:07:30.38
- Hey, Mom.[br]- Yes, hon?

00:07:30.56,00:07:33.15
We found an Etheropian.[br]Can we keep him?

00:07:33.33,00:07:35.92
- Sure, hon.[br]- Sweet.

00:07:36.76,00:07:40.93
- Let's bring him to school.[br]- I want you to meet my brother.

00:07:41.10,00:07:43.07
He's my son. I adopted him.

00:07:43.23,00:07:45.83
- It was my mom's card.[br]- We'll switch off.

00:07:46.00,00:07:49.00
He'll stay here.[br]Then with Stan, then me.

00:07:49.17,00:07:53.11
- Not with Kenny. His family's too poor.[br]- Totally.

00:07:55.15,00:07:59.58
Look how the leaves fall so delicately[br]on the surface of the pond.

00:07:59.78,00:08:01.51
It's so beautiful.

00:08:01.72,00:08:04.52
Not as beautiful as you.

00:08:09.19,00:08:13.03
Darling, look. Thanksgiving turkeys.

00:08:13.23,00:08:15.20
They're so beautiful.

00:08:15.40,00:08:17.33
Not as beautiful as you.

00:08:17.67,00:08:22.97
Look at the way they foam at the mouth[br]like beautiful suds of beer.

00:08:23.17,00:08:25.30
Not as beautiful as...

00:08:32.32,00:08:35.05
This is a great way[br]to experience America.

00:08:35.22,00:08:37.55
This is an all-you-can-eat buffet.

00:08:37.72,00:08:42.49
You can eat all you want for $6.99.[br]That's why we all come on Tuesdays.

00:08:42.66,00:08:46.79
Except for Kenny's family.[br]To them, $6.99 is two years' income.

00:08:47.30,00:08:51.03
Why is your family poor?[br]Is your dad an alcoholic too?

00:08:52.44,00:08:56.31
You see, Starvin' Marvin,[br]these are called appetizers.

00:08:56.47,00:08:57.53
Appetizer.

00:08:57.71,00:09:02.04
This is what you eat before you eat[br]to make you more hungry.

00:09:02.58,00:09:05.61
Food's here.[br]That's it for the appetizers.

00:09:09.59,00:09:11.89
No, that's my potpie.

00:09:12.06,00:09:15.36
This is the time of year[br]you're supposed to share.

00:09:15.53,00:09:18.52
You're right.[br]You gonna eat your cobbler?

00:09:18.70,00:09:22.89
No, you don't want all that.[br]Why don't you share it with me?

00:09:23.07,00:09:25.16
Let me just have some of that.

00:09:27.91,00:09:31.67
I'm a little disappointed[br]in your Thanksgiving spirit.

00:09:31.84,00:09:35.44
Only a few cans have been donated[br]to our food drive.

00:09:35.61,00:09:39.14
And can't we do a little better[br]than creamed corn...

00:09:39.35,00:09:41.82
...creamed corn and creamed corn?

00:09:43.12,00:09:45.09
Bring in more diverse food...

00:09:45.29,00:09:49.42
...or else Kenny's family will have[br]a pretty corny Thanksgiving.

00:09:56.03,00:09:58.33
Corny Thanksgiving!

00:09:59.90,00:10:04.43
Anyway, some of you have brought[br]something special for show-and-tell.

00:10:04.61,00:10:06.13
- Yeah.[br]- Yeah, we did.

00:10:06.34,00:10:09.61
All right, boys.[br]Show us what you've brought.

00:10:09.98,00:10:14.35
This is our new Ethernopian:[br]Starvin' Marvin.

00:10:14.75,00:10:18.15
He can do cool stuff[br]with his voice. Show them.

00:10:18.32,00:10:21.62
No, Starvin' Marvin,[br]that's Kenny's creamed corn.

00:10:21.83,00:10:24.09
That's a bad Starvin' Marvin!

00:10:24.30,00:10:27.82
What the hell are you doing?[br]This is horribly wrong.

00:10:28.00,00:10:31.94
- How did you get him?[br]- He came instead of the sports watch.

00:10:32.10,00:10:34.63
- From the commercial?[br]- Yeah, that one.

00:10:34.81,00:10:36.93
- I want a Starvin' Marvin.[br]- Me too.

00:10:37.11,00:10:40.13
- Yes, I'll pay $50 for one.[br]- I want one!

00:10:40.38,00:10:43.07
You're too young to take care of him.

00:10:43.25,00:10:46.34
I'll call the Red Cross[br]and have him returned.

00:10:46.52,00:10:48.95
We shouldn't have brought him here.

00:10:49.45,00:10:53.25
Thank you very much.[br]You can pick him up tonight. Bye.

00:10:53.42,00:10:56.29
- I hope you've learned your lesson.[br]- No.

00:10:56.46,00:10:59.95
- You can't care for him.[br]- I thought we were supposed to.

00:11:00.13,00:11:02.96
But you don't get involved[br]with the child.

00:11:03.13,00:11:06.04
You send money,[br]and they write you a letter.

00:11:06.20,00:11:09.37
He didn't grow up[br]in a normal place like here.

00:11:09.54,00:11:12.34
- Why can't he live here now?[br]- Because he can't.

00:11:12.51,00:11:15.88
- Because why?[br]- Because 8-year-olds can't be parents!

00:11:16.05,00:11:19.54
- Then you take care of him.[br]- I can't. I'm very busy.

00:11:20.79,00:11:22.95
I send my $5 a month, see?

00:11:23.25,00:11:27.49
- This sucks, he's our friend.[br]- Back to the poor country with you.

00:11:27.69,00:11:31.65
Watch what you say.[br]You might be poor and hungry someday.

00:11:31.83,00:11:32.82
Yeah, right.

00:11:35.07,00:11:38.23
I knew you were[br]the only person who'd listen.

00:11:38.44,00:11:42.40
Let's get it over with.[br]This gives me the booboo-jeebies.

00:11:42.61,00:11:46.44
Look here in my microscope.[br]Tell me what you see.

00:11:47.01,00:11:49.48
I see an extreme close-up...

00:11:49.68,00:11:53.01
...of Vanessa Redgrave's[br]private parts.

00:11:54.02,00:11:56.49
Now tell me what you see.

00:11:56.69,00:11:58.25
Well, I'm no biologist...

00:11:58.42,00:12:01.88
...but it looks like turkey DNA.[br]- Precisely.

00:12:02.06,00:12:05.29
- Look how rapidly it's dividing.[br]- What's it mean?

00:12:05.46,00:12:08.23
The turkeys are growing exponentially.

00:12:08.43,00:12:12.20
If we don't destroy them,[br]they'll take over the town.

00:12:12.37,00:12:15.50
- Maybe the world.[br]- Oh, fudge!

00:12:15.81,00:12:19.44
Let me see that[br]Vanessa Redgrave thing again.

00:12:19.64,00:12:20.87
Sure.

00:12:25.35,00:12:28.32
We're looking for[br]a starving African child...

00:12:28.52,00:12:32.85
...who was accidentally sent here[br]instead of a Teiko sports watch.

00:12:38.83,00:12:41.82
Hey, what's going on? Let go of me!

00:12:42.03,00:12:44.09
I'll kick you in the nuts!

00:12:44.30,00:12:47.79
Here's your sports watch, son.[br]Sorry for the mix-up.

00:12:48.91,00:12:51.27
Now you're pissing me off!

00:12:51.48,00:12:53.14
Sweet.

00:12:56.91,00:13:01.01
- So how does this thing work?[br]- It's based on the cash grab.

00:13:01.22,00:13:04.12
Instead of money,[br]cans are in the capsule.

00:13:04.29,00:13:07.19
The pov catches as many as he can.

00:13:07.36,00:13:10.12
- "Pov"?[br]- Poverty stricken citizen.

00:13:10.33,00:13:12.16
Oh, brilliant.

00:13:17.74,00:13:20.83
- What the hell is this?[br]- I don't know, mayor.

00:13:21.01,00:13:24.57
- It's not on the program.[br]- They're increasing in number.

00:13:24.74,00:13:27.54
These are the turkeys[br]I warned you about.

00:13:27.75,00:13:33.05
It's true, mayor. Those turkeys[br]just ripped apart my cafeteria.

00:13:33.35,00:13:35.91
You won't get away[br]with this, you bastards!

00:13:36.09,00:13:38.52
Those are some pissed off turkeys.

00:13:38.96,00:13:43.98
Okay, people, don't panic![br]Bring out the defense squad!

00:13:49.47,00:13:53.43
We need more than that.[br]They'll come back in larger numbers.

00:13:55.17,00:13:58.67
- Phillip, could you pass the beans?[br]- Beans?

00:13:58.84,00:14:02.44
Looks like we'll be at war[br]with these Indians soon.

00:14:03.28,00:14:05.01
Wait, wait, wait.

00:14:05.18,00:14:06.81
Here it comes.

00:14:08.85,00:14:11.15
I crapped in my pants!

00:14:11.32,00:14:14.78
I think you got some spat[br]on Chief Running Wolf.

00:14:14.96,00:14:18.76
I spatted his face.[br]Now he's a smelly Indian.

00:14:19.16,00:14:22.56
We'll be back to part 1 4[br]of Terrance & Phillip...

00:14:22.77,00:14:23.83
...right after this.

00:14:24.00,00:14:26.97
Hunger is an enemy[br]that we all must fight.

00:14:27.17,00:14:30.33
These children desperately[br]need your support.

00:14:30.51,00:14:33.10
Somebody get me out of here![br]This sucks!

00:14:33.28,00:14:36.27
So please call[br]and adopt a child today.

00:14:36.45,00:14:38.88
I'm seriously getting pissed off!

00:14:39.25,00:14:43.28
- You want more Cheesy Poofs?[br]- Yeah, I want the Cheesy Poofs.

00:14:43.45,00:14:44.44
Okay.

00:14:44.66,00:14:46.25
Sweet.

00:14:47.02,00:14:48.65
This is serious bullsh *t!

00:14:48.83,00:14:52.13
There has to be a Happy Burger[br]around here.

00:14:52.30,00:14:56.89
Excuse me, I am a lost little boy.[br]Could you help me?

00:14:59.00,00:15:00.99
Well, screw you too!

00:15:01.21,00:15:06.01
Who let these flies in here? Hasn't[br]anybody heard of insect repellent?

00:15:07.68,00:15:13.05
All right, everyone, it's time[br]to give out canned food to the poor.

00:15:15.52,00:15:17.65
- Where's Cartman?[br]- I don't know.

00:15:17.82,00:15:19.79
Do you know where he is?

00:15:19.99,00:15:23.86
Looks like we have[br]the turkey problem under control.

00:15:24.06,00:15:29.66
It's time to embrace the spirit[br]of giving with the canned-food grab.

00:15:31.04,00:15:32.73
Come on, hurry up.

00:15:37.34,00:15:38.81
Grab a lot, son.

00:15:39.38,00:15:42.64
Happy, happy Thanksgiving.[br]Let her rip!

00:15:45.92,00:15:49.18
Come on, grab those cans, little boy!

00:15:52.42,00:15:55.09
- Come on, Kenny![br]- Come on, son!

00:15:57.86,00:16:03.30
Now, let's see all the goodies you're[br]going to take home to your family.

00:16:04.14,00:16:08.87
It looks like he got[br]a can of string beans.

00:16:13.71,00:16:17.41
- What the...?[br]- Dude, the mutant turkeys are back.

00:16:22.65,00:16:27.02
Okay, people, move along.[br]Nothing to see here, you looky-Ioos.

00:16:27.23,00:16:32.22
- I told you, but you didn't listen.[br]- Gather around and listen good.

00:16:32.43,00:16:35.42
Go to your homes and arm your...

00:16:41.14,00:16:46.10
- What the hell are you supposed to be?[br]- That's not important right now.

00:16:46.28,00:16:50.48
What's this thing supposed to be?[br]It doesn't look like anything.

00:16:50.68,00:16:53.01
- Chef, the turkeys.[br]- All right.

00:16:53.22,00:16:55.45
Listen up and listen good.

00:16:55.62,00:16:59.78
Go to your homes and arm yourselves[br]with whatever you can.

00:16:59.96,00:17:03.55
We'll meet back here[br]in 1 5 minutes. Hurry.

00:17:05.10,00:17:09.29
We won't let our Thanksgiving[br]be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.

00:17:11.84,00:17:13.90
Dang, you guys.

00:17:14.11,00:17:16.40
Seriously, I'm hungry.

00:17:16.61,00:17:18.20
I have to eat.

00:17:18.88,00:17:20.57
Sweet, the Red Cross.

00:17:20.78,00:17:24.34
I'll have fried chicken[br]and mashed potatoes, please.

00:17:24.55,00:17:27.78
Sorry, we're out of food.[br]We ran out of funding.

00:17:27.95,00:17:31.79
We couldn't get enough sponsors,[br]so we gotta pack it up.

00:17:31.96,00:17:34.72
I'm not an Ethernopian.[br]I gotta get home!

00:17:34.93,00:17:39.73
Sorry, we just don't have any funds.[br]Here, have a Teiko sports watch.

00:17:42.03,00:17:43.66
Weak!

00:17:43.87,00:17:49.74
People, we all have to do our part[br]against the evil turkeys.

00:17:49.94,00:17:52.43
- There's too many of them.[br]- Come on.

00:17:52.64,00:17:57.05
- Where is that Thanksgiving spirit?[br]- We can't stop them.

00:18:00.45,00:18:03.39
Today, you fight for your city.

00:18:03.59,00:18:05.68
You fight for your honor.

00:18:05.89,00:18:08.38
These turkeys will continue to push...

00:18:08.59,00:18:12.03
...until they have taken[br]everything from us.

00:18:12.33,00:18:17.50
These fudged-up turkeys from the[br]crustaceous era can take our lives...

00:18:17.70,00:18:21.66
...but they can never take[br]our freedom!

00:18:44.33,00:18:45.63
Here you go, turkeys.

00:18:52.20,00:18:54.07
Does my hair look okay?

00:18:57.11,00:18:59.44
Can't go on.

00:18:59.61,00:19:02.01
Need appetizer.

00:19:03.68,00:19:07.74
I'm sorry, God.[br]I'm sorry I mocked poor people.

00:19:07.95,00:19:10.48
I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive.

00:19:10.69,00:19:11.92
Please.

00:19:12.12,00:19:14.02
Please, God.

00:19:19.20,00:19:21.99
My God has forsaken me.

00:19:33.81,00:19:35.87
I wonder what's in here?

00:19:41.45,00:19:43.44
Snacky Cakes!

00:19:51.63,00:19:54.62
- Sally Struthers?[br]- Who the hell are you?

00:19:54.83,00:19:58.27
- Give me that cake![br]- No, this is my cake.

00:19:58.47,00:20:02.63
- Sally Struthers, give me that cake.[br]- No, you can't have any.

00:20:09.68,00:20:13.28
You guys, Sally Struthers is[br]holding food from us!

00:20:30.70,00:20:32.10
Stay close, children.

00:20:42.31,00:20:45.98
- Oh, my God, they've killed Kenny![br]- You bastards!

00:20:46.15,00:20:49.12
The last three are getting away![br]Shoot them!

00:20:50.32,00:20:53.81
- We did it![br]- My God, what have we done?

00:20:54.02,00:20:55.72
We've saved Thanksgiving.

00:20:55.89,00:20:58.79
But those poor turkeys,[br]they're all dead.

00:20:58.96,00:21:02.83
Every turkey dies.[br]Not every turkey truly lives.

00:21:03.03,00:21:06.40
As horrible as they were,[br]they felt like a part of me.

00:21:06.57,00:21:11.01
Perhaps I shouldn't toy with[br]God's creations. Perhaps I should...

00:21:12.11,00:21:15.04
We're looking for[br]a starving Ethiopian boy...

00:21:15.21,00:21:18.51
...who was accidentally delivered[br]instead of a Teiko sports watch.

00:21:18.68,00:21:20.71
Have you seen anyone like this?

00:21:20.89,00:21:25.08
That could be a hundred kids[br]in this town, mister.

00:21:25.92,00:21:29.15
There you are.[br]Are you ready to go home now?

00:21:39.50,00:21:43.74
- It sucks he has to leave.[br]- I like him a lot more than Cartman.

00:21:43.91,00:21:45.88
I've learned something today.

00:21:46.04,00:21:50.24
It's easy not to think of images[br]on TV as real, but they are.

00:21:50.41,00:21:56.01
That's why it's easy to ignore those[br]commercials, but people on TV are real.

00:21:56.19,00:21:58.42
That means MacGyver's real too.

00:21:58.59,00:22:03.42
We're terribly sorry about the mix-up.[br]We'll get you home immediately.

00:22:03.63,00:22:07.65
That's right, you will.[br]Move it povs, I'm an American!

00:22:33.46,00:22:37.45
Lord, on this day of thanks,[br]we extend our deepest gratitude...

00:22:37.63,00:22:42.09
...for this incredible bounty of green[br]beans you have bestowed upon us.

00:22:42.83,00:22:47.29
Though you, for some reason, found it[br]necessary to take our son...

00:22:47.47,00:22:51.34
...and though you find pleasure[br]in watching us suffer...

00:22:51.54,00:22:53.74
...still, we give thanks. Amen.

00:22:53.91,00:22:55.24
Amen.

00:22:56.21,00:22:59.65
Does anybody have a can opener?

00:22:59.85,00:23:01.44
Goddamn it.
