Season 13 Episode 7
"Fatbeard"

2
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:34,694
You guys! You guys!
We can finally do it!

3
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:38,481
We can finally leave this crappy town
and live the life we've all dreamed of!

4
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:40,831
- We can?
- What are you talking about, dude?

5
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,126
Haven't you assholes
been watching the news?

6
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,093
Pirating is back, my friends.

7
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:47,215
Swashbuckling adventure
on the high seas.

8
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,716
The stuff we've all dreamed about!
And it's all happening right here.

9
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:52,638
Somalia!

10
00:00:53,038 --> 00:00:55,337
- Somalia? Where's that?
- North Africa.

11
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:59,068
Just picture it, guys!
Clear blue water with skull islands!

12
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,408
Waterfalls and jeweled
treasure underneath!

13
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,855
I've worked it all out on Expedia.
We can take

14
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,881
Southwest Airlines to Miami,
then Dubai Air here to Cairo.

15
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:10,986
Then it's just a 49-hour bus ride
into Mogadishu,

16
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,781
with all the booty
and plunder a pirate could want.

17
00:01:14,872 --> 00:01:17,154
You know, Cartman,
that is an awesome idea.

18
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:19,823
- You should totally go to Somalia.
- Right! And we...

19
00:01:20,742 --> 00:01:23,457
Wait a minute. You never
think my ideas are good, Kyle.

20
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:25,582
No, I'm being totally serious.

21
00:01:25,707 --> 00:01:29,118
That is the best idea you've ever had.
You should run away to Mogadishu.

22
00:01:29,243 --> 00:01:31,966
You should go there right away.
I'll even help pay for your ticket!

23
00:01:32,736 --> 00:01:34,238
Cool! Wait a minute.

24
00:01:34,363 --> 00:01:36,514
The fuck! Why would you do that?

25
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:39,598
Unless, you're trying
to trick me somehow.

26
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,394
No, you're right. Somalia is
an oasis of treasure and waterfalls!

27
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,313
- It's totally the pirate's life!
- Then why don't you wanna go?

28
00:01:47,228 --> 00:01:49,514
'cause, dude, I'm Jewish,
and you know...

29
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:51,244
Jews can't be pirates.

30
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:52,469
That's true.

31
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:55,866
Well, I'm glad you've finally come
to terms with your disability, Kyle.

32
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:58,142
Gentlemen,
I'm off to start planning.

33
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:01,912
Please.

34
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:03,539
Please let him go.

35
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:07,755
<i>Good morning, students.
These are the morning announcements.</i>

36
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,379
<i>Teacher-parent conferences
were rescheduled to next Tuesday.</i>

37
00:02:10,635 --> 00:02:12,107
<i>Please inform your parents.</i>

38
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,967
<i>The gym is being repainted
and is closed until tomorrow afternoon.</i>

39
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:17,352
<i>And now for a special announcement.</i>

40
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:19,520
<i>Avast there, mateys!</i>

41
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,937
<i>Do you have a thirst for adventure
on the high seas of life?</i>

42
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:27,108
<i>Sick and tired of parents and teachers
telling ye what to do all the time?</i>

43
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:30,281
<i>Then join Captain Cartman's
perfect pirate club!</i>

44
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,170
<i>Just imagine it, me hearties!</i>

45
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:34,993
<i>A life without rules,
without homework and chores!</i>

46
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:37,551
<i>You can live the pirate's life
in Somalia, me friends.</i>

47
00:02:37,676 --> 00:02:40,826
<i>Even Kyle said so.
Our first official pirate meetin'</i>

48
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,746
<i>will be 4:00 PM today,
at Kevin Stoley's house.</i>

49
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,262
- At my house? Why my house?
- <i>There will be refreshments served.</i>

50
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:49,627
<i>So make sure your mom
goes to the grocery store!</i>

51
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,752
<i>So come all.</i>

52
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:53,850
<i>The invitation is open to any student
who wants to be a pirate,</i>

53
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:56,645
<i>and who isn't Jewish,
Mexican or ginger.</i>

54
00:02:57,874 --> 00:03:00,628
<i>And for lunch today,
the cafeteria will be serving</i>

55
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:03,453
<i>taco salad or hoagie sandwiches.
Thank you.</i>

56
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:06,738
Ahoy, fellow club members!

57
00:03:06,863 --> 00:03:09,651
Congratulations on leaving
your meaningless lives behind

58
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:11,176
to become pirates.

59
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:15,082
Your life of boredom is at an end,

60
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:18,197
thanks to Captain Cartman.
All hands on deck!

61
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:22,451
Attention!

62
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,950
All right, ye booty lubbers!

63
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:28,754
So you decided to join
Captain Cartman, did ye...

64
00:03:32,396 --> 00:03:35,033
Guys. Who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?

65
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:39,968
There's really not that many of us.
We figured we should let him join.

66
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:44,267
But, g-i-n-g-e-r-s can't be pirates,
'cause they don't have souls.

67
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:47,476
- Please get it out of here.
- Fine! I don't want to be a pirate!

68
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,869
OK, anyways.

69
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:55,150
Now, enough small talk, lads! It's time
for us to start rappin' and plunderin'!

70
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:57,370
We set course tomorrow!

71
00:03:57,495 --> 00:04:00,572
I purchased everyone's tickets online
using me mother's credit card.

72
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:02,808
And your mom is OK with that?

73
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,959
Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do
I care what me mother thinks anymore?

74
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:07,996
Neat-o!

75
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:12,168
All right, lads. Go home and write
your farewell letters to your families.

76
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,960
The land of pirates awaits!

77
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:16,766
- Pirates ho!
- Pirates ho!

78
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:23,085
Kevin, goddammit.

79
00:04:29,498 --> 00:04:31,698
Have a good flight.
Next, please?

80
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:37,033
We be heading to Somalia,
by way of Miami to Cairo.

81
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:40,237
And take care you put us
in an exit row, you landlubber.

82
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:43,083
I see, you five boys

83
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,867
are all booked through
to Cairo by yourselves?

84
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:49,329
That we be, lass. It's all paid for
on me mother's credit card.

85
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,270
Jeez. I don't know
if I can really go through with this.

86
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:55,936
- What?
- It's just leaving everything behind.

87
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:58,205
I can't believe
I'm actually doing it.

88
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,730
- Maybe we should think about this.
- You guys, the fuck!

89
00:05:02,055 --> 00:05:04,200
Are you forgetting
how crappy your lives are?

90
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:05,973
All the homework, the rules?

91
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:09,724
You really want to go back to school,
where people just make fun of you?

92
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:11,564
Who? You mean you?

93
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,105
- Do you really wanna go back to that?
- No, I'm sick of it!

94
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:18,359
Well, all right then, fag!
We can't turn back now.

95
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,023
The path to adventure lies
just beyond this ticket counter,

96
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:24,373
and if you four have really come
all this way just to turn back now,

97
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:27,617
then seriously, you guys...
The fuck?

98
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:31,387
He's right, lads.
To adventure!

99
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,093
This is Somalia?

100
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:20,904
Where's all the waterfalls
and shipwreck lagoons?

101
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:23,223
The fuck!

102
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:25,341
Excuse me.
Where are the pirates?

103
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:29,512
We're looking for the pirates.

104
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,614
Where can we find the...

105
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,767
Get the phrase book out.

106
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:36,487
Ask these people
where the pirates are.

107
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:49,157
He says they're in there!

108
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:52,848
Nice! Come on, mateys!

109
00:06:57,478 --> 00:06:59,918
Yes, bla, bla, bla. Thank you.

110
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:07,929
Avast!

111
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:15,308
These aren't pirates.
They're just a bunch of black people.

112
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,620
I'm Captain Cartman
and this here be my terrible crew.

113
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,002
We be looking
for a ship to pirate with.

114
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:44,521
Yes, very nice.
Apparently these are the pirates.

115
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:53,520
Excellent!
They're taking us to a ship!

116
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:56,974
Once we commandeer a vessel,
the plundering will be easy indeed.

117
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,960
This is your pirate boat?

118
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:05,333
Dude. The fuck?

119
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:08,613
Seriously, guys,
what kind of pirates are you?

120
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,338
I mean, really.
The fuck, dude. The fuck?

121
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:17,036
Guess we'll have
to settle with this meager ship.

122
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:19,583
Two of you sit aft
and two of you sit in the front.

123
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:22,263
I gotta sit middle,
'cause I get motion sickness.

124
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,377
Kevin, Jesus Christ.

125
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:31,080
Hard to starboard, lads!

126
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:33,159
There's sure to be lots
of booties out here!

127
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:43,604
Clyde, the fuck?

128
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:46,972
You said there was gonna be
crystal clear lagoons

129
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:48,847
and treasure and plunder!

130
00:08:50,152 --> 00:08:52,071
Calm down.
Everything's gonna be okay!

131
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:55,396
No, it's not. You made me
run away and be a pirate

132
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:57,660
and there's not even any treasure!

133
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,620
Ike, do something
about Clyde, please!

134
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:03,997
Very nice, Ike.

135
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:05,920
All right, me hearties!

136
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,246
Keep your eyes open
for boats to plunder!

137
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:54,966
Dude! You're doing it all wrong.
Let me handle this.

138
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:57,081
<i>All right, ye scallywags!</i>

139
00:09:57,206 --> 00:10:00,821
<i>Surrender your plunder lest
we start firing shots across your bow!</i>

140
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,528
Yeah, that's good,
but now go "argh!"

141
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:15,571
You checked with Kenny and Token?
He's not staying at their houses?

142
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:18,741
No, everyone's checked. I think
Cartman really ran away to Somalia.

143
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:21,973
Yes! I can't help but take
some credit for this.

144
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:24,622
- I helped convince him to go!
- You think he'll die in Somalia?

145
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:28,688
For sure. It's the most
godforsaken place on the planet!

146
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:30,923
Things are finally gonna
be normal around here!

147
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,167
Oh, God!

148
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:34,556
Oh, God!
What did we do wrong, Gerald?

149
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,307
Take it easy. We'll find him!

150
00:10:36,432 --> 00:10:39,148
- I'll call you back.
- Kyle! He's gone!

151
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:41,501
Your little brother's
run away from home!

152
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:42,894
What? Are you sure?

153
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,601
He left a note saying
he's never coming back!

154
00:10:46,518 --> 00:10:49,274
"Dear mommy and daddy.
I am running away.

155
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,660
I am sorry,

156
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:53,821
but I cannot longer handle
the monotony of middle class life.

157
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,706
Everyone at school
is a fucking idiot,

158
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:58,625
and if one more person talked to me
about that Susan Boyle performance

159
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,811
of <i>Les Misérables</i> I was going to puke
my balls out through my mouth.

160
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:05,891
I love you all, but I have to move on.
I'm going to Somalia to be a...

161
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:07,831
to be a pirate."
Oh, shit!

162
00:11:08,272 --> 00:11:10,164
Gerald, what are we gonna do?

163
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:13,573
He couldn't have gone far.
Let's call the other kids' houses.

164
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,874
God, what have I done?

165
00:11:26,046 --> 00:11:28,686
The fuck are you pirates doing?
Are we gonna plunder them or not?

166
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,413
Let's go.

167
00:11:58,744 --> 00:12:02,704
Quiet, ye sons of biscuit eaters!
This boat is now pirate property!

168
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:05,347
Now get ye to yer lifeboat,
lest ye wanna be shark bait!

169
00:12:07,336 --> 00:12:09,889
Plunder the booty, lads!
This ship is ours!

170
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,188
I said get off my boat.

171
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,914
That's it!
Get in there ye swarmy dogs!

172
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:32,875
Lower 'em down, Ike!

173
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:37,754
Have a good day!

174
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:50,309
- Hard to port, lads.
- Hard to port!

175
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:52,144
What's port?

176
00:12:52,895 --> 00:12:54,917
Just make the boat go
that way, kind of.

177
00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:09,578
That's good!
Now bring her around portside!

178
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:18,394
Now, that's a pirate ship.

179
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,637
A fine day of plunderin' we had, boys.
What about yourselves?

180
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:31,123
Here ye are, lads.
Plenty of booty to go around.

181
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:34,278
A round of grog for me boys.

182
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:36,169
A round of grog for everyone!

183
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:42,527
The fuck is this?
This is water in a Dixie Cup!

184
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:45,229
All right, goddammit.
Really, you guys.

185
00:13:45,354 --> 00:13:47,603
What kind of pirates are you?
Look at yourselves!

186
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:49,159
You're a disgrace to Blackbeard!

187
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:52,128
I don't know where you people
get off calling yourselves pirates...

188
00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:54,414
Little beat-up boats,
water in Dixie Cups.

189
00:13:54,582 --> 00:13:57,845
I mean, look! Look at this guy!
Look at this guy, for Christ's sake!

190
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,603
I mean, how hard is this, people?

191
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,502
I tell ye, lads, if we're gonna be
the most feared people on earth,

192
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:09,805
then there needs to be
some goddamn changes around here!

193
00:14:10,358 --> 00:14:13,429
<i>We drink and we pillage
and we do what we please</i>

194
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:15,675
<i>We get all we want for free</i>

195
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,114
<i>We'll kick your ass
then rape your lass</i>

196
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:19,809
<i>Somalian pirates we</i>

197
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:21,608
<i>So with a yo ho ho</i>

198
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:26,065
Goddammit, people.

199
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:28,169
<i>With a yo ho ho!</i>

200
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:31,743
<i>And with a yee hee hee!</i>

201
00:14:33,854 --> 00:14:35,942
<i>We take to the African sea</i>

202
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:38,650
<i>We'll brave the squalls
and bust your balls</i>

203
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:40,252
<i>Somalian pirates we</i>

204
00:14:40,753 --> 00:14:43,682
<i>Somalian pirates we</i>

205
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,758
<i>We left our homes
and we left our mothers</i>

206
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:48,677
<i>to go on a pillaging spree</i>

207
00:14:49,034 --> 00:14:51,394
<i>We'll cut off your ears
and break your toes</i>

208
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,556
<i>and make you drink our pee</i>

209
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:55,841
<i>And if you sail into our waters,</i>

210
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:57,927
<i>you best hear this decree</i>

211
00:14:58,052 --> 00:15:00,298
<i>We'll take your boat
and set your ass afloat</i>

212
00:15:00,423 --> 00:15:02,456
- <i>Somalian pirates we</i>
- Nice!

213
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:03,873
<i>With a yo ho ho</i>

214
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,141
<i>And a trick a lotty do</i>

215
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:09,072
<i>We'll shoot you
in the face with glee</i>

216
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,080
- <i>We'll cut off...</i>
- Let's stop for a minute.

217
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:13,570
Remember on "trick a lotty do",
that's an lotty do.

218
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,620
Really need you guys
to enunciate the lotty.

219
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:16,871
Nadif?

220
00:15:17,522 --> 00:15:21,292
If I can get you and Abdikarim to sing
the harmony on the second "yo ho".

221
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:22,836
And... Hashmish?

222
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,575
I'm sorry, but you're a little flat.
Sing out, don't close your throat.

223
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,218
So let's go from bar 14.
Pick up after the quarter rest. Ike?

224
00:15:32,252 --> 00:15:34,180
- <i>Somalian pirates we</i>
- Better!

225
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:35,795
<i>With a yo ho ho</i>

226
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,997
<i>And a trick a lotty do</i>

227
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,924
<i>We'll shoot you
in the face with glee</i>

228
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:43,231
<i>Then we'll cut off your cock
and feed it to a crock</i>

229
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,625
Somalian pirates we!

230
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,982
<i>Somalian pirates...</i>

231
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:50,207
<i>we!</i>

232
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:54,826
<i>Somalian pirates we</i>

233
00:15:57,293 --> 00:15:59,205
We found them adrift
in a lifeboat, sir.

234
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,416
They said that pirates
took their ship by force.

235
00:16:02,284 --> 00:16:03,334
Damn pirates!

236
00:16:03,821 --> 00:16:06,740
What's causing them
to suddenly be so much more active?

237
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:07,922
Is the crew okay?

238
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,952
Yes, sir. They're French,
so they surrendered immediately.

239
00:16:11,077 --> 00:16:13,428
Once they boarded your ship,
how did they force you off?

240
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:25,938
Sir, the pirates appear
to have forced

241
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:28,234
the French crew off their boat
with a lightsaber.

242
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:32,483
My God. The pirates are getting
better equipped every day!

243
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:35,341
Gentlemen, I want the President
of the United States on the phone.

244
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:37,963
We can no longer fight
the pirates on the seas.

245
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:40,147
We have to take them out
where they live.

246
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:48,178
What did I tell you, Butters?
This is the good life, huh?

247
00:16:52,593 --> 00:16:53,613
What's going on?

248
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,184
Good. A hostage
will bring a fine ransom!

249
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,851
Well, well, well!

250
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:13,529
<i>This is CNN... N.</i>

251
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:17,642
Breaking news of yet
another pirate crisis in Somalia.

252
00:17:18,096 --> 00:17:21,655
Members of NATO receive word today
that pirates have captured

253
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,105
an American child,

254
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,719
and are demanding 10 million euros
for his safe release.

255
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:30,074
U.S. Navy ships have been deployed
and the pirate standoff

256
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,380
is about to get ugly.

257
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,372
Well, well, well... Kyle.

258
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,591
You came all this way
to try and join my pirate club.

259
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:42,871
No, fatass, I came to get my brother!
We all have to get out of here!

260
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,727
- It isn't safe!
- It isn't safe?

261
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,642
That's not what you said
back in the cafeteria, Kyle.

262
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,816
In the cafeteria, you said
Somalia was awesome.

263
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:51,818
I know. I was lying.

264
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,696
Or are you lying now? So many lies,
you can't even keep them straight!

265
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,534
You couldn't stand that we were living
in paradise while you were back home.

266
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:03,523
This isn't paradise, and you know it.
The people here are starving and dying!

267
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:06,558
The whole world has used Somalia
as a dumping ground for toxic waste.

268
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:08,042
Even the fish are radioactive.

269
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:15,920
Cartman, just give me my brother
and let us get out of here.

270
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:19,513
Your brother is with Butters
taking inventory of our latest plunder.

271
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:23,138
You... just sit tight till we hear
about your ransom money.

272
00:18:24,307 --> 00:18:26,257
One box of Italian passports!

273
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:28,404
One necklace, gold!

274
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:30,579
Three crew member watches.

275
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:33,561
Excuse me. Can I ask you a question?

276
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:36,570
Sure, Guleed.

277
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:38,864
Why did you Americans come here?

278
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,150
'cause our lives sucked back home!

279
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:44,550
- We had all these rules and homework.
- Yeah, homework!

280
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:46,326
And our parents hollered at us.

281
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,084
- So we wanted to be pirates.
- Pirates!

282
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:52,322
But that's what I do not understand.

283
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:55,102
Why would anyone
want to be a pirate?

284
00:18:57,233 --> 00:19:00,583
Every day, I dream
that I can go to school,

285
00:19:00,904 --> 00:19:02,300
learn about the world.

286
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:05,273
But my mother, she's dying of AIDS,

287
00:19:05,398 --> 00:19:07,321
and there is no money for medicine.

288
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,581
My father was killed
trying to find food for us.

289
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,243
Do you know how I feel
every time we try to capture a boat?

290
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:16,596
Scared.

291
00:19:16,876 --> 00:19:19,728
And not just scared,
because I might get killed,

292
00:19:19,853 --> 00:19:23,120
but scared because
if I don't get something out of it,

293
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,745
my family and friends
are going to die.

294
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:29,964
I don't want to be a pirate.
I have don't see how anybody would.

295
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,038
Oh, my God.

296
00:19:37,784 --> 00:19:41,425
Jeez, guess we kinda got
put in our place, huh, Ike?

297
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:44,385
I feel like an asshole.

298
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:46,677
Me too.

299
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:53,564
- Go on! Walk the plank, ye scurvy dog!
- Cartman, knock it off!

300
00:19:54,014 --> 00:19:56,192
That's Captain Cartman,
ye jewswoggle.

301
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:07,078
Listen, we wanna go home.

302
00:20:07,562 --> 00:20:10,159
- What?
- Me and Ike, we've been talking, and...

303
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:13,375
Well, guys, we really had it
pretty good back in America.

304
00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:15,257
I mean, sure,

305
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,268
it's easy to think our lives
are boring and full of rules,

306
00:20:18,393 --> 00:20:20,341
but a lot of people
have it way worse.

307
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:23,541
The pirates' life isn't
a life of fun and adventure.

308
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,615
It's a life of hardship
and suffering.

309
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,582
When you get down to it, we were
pretty lucky to have the lives we did.

310
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:37,242
I hate it here. It wanna go home!

311
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,790
You guys cannot leave
the pirate club now!

312
00:20:40,915 --> 00:20:43,679
How can you not want to stay
in this paradise we've created?

313
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:45,781
In Somalia, people have no laws!

314
00:20:45,906 --> 00:20:47,826
They have no rules,
and they never grow old!

315
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:50,746
They never grow old
because they die before they're 30!

316
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:54,892
Nobody's going anywhere.
I'm the captain of this outfit!

317
00:20:56,143 --> 00:20:57,143
To arms!

318
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,499
Now, is there any question
who's in charge?

319
00:21:03,758 --> 00:21:06,845
I have an entire pirate crew
willing to do anything for me.

320
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:14,651
All right, men. Remember,
do not hit the white ones!

321
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:19,069
Me and my crew
are gonna go on pirating forever!

322
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,660
Clear.

323
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:35,136
The fuck?
