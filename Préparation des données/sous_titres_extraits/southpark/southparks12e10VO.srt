3
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,360
I don't get it, Kenny. Why did you
buy razors and shaving cream?

4
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,430
'Cuz, dude,
I'm gonna shave my balls.

5
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,180
Shave your balls?
Why would you shave your balls?

6
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,970
Because girls like shaved balls.

7
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,370
- Girls like shaved balls?
- Yes, they do.

8
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,160
What girl is gonna see your balls?

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,425
I don't know.

10
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,352
Oh, jesus, there's another one!

11
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,720
Another pan flute band.

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,528
Have you noticed there's bands
like this everywhere you go lately?

13
00:01:08,797 --> 00:01:11,290
I saw like three of those
bands down in Denver yesterday.

14
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,070
All their crappy music
sounds the same.

15
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,334
I'm so sick of hearing
this music everywhere I go!

16
00:01:15,454 --> 00:01:17,279
I think Kenny likes it.

17
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,660
- I gotta get home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.

18
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,037
God!

19
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:32,030
- Shut up already!
- I'm outta here. See you guys.

20
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:40,603
<i>Tonight, the travel
channel takes you to london!</i>

21
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:42,904
<i>London has something for everyone.</i>

22
00:01:43,024 --> 00:01:46,603
<i>Sights. Theater.
And wonderful street performers.</i>

23
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,825
- They're in london, too?
- Hey, time for dinner, guys.

24
00:01:55,547 --> 00:01:58,070
- All right, kids. Dig in.
- Where's dad?

25
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,308
He's upstairs videotaping your
grandfather in the bathtub.

26
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:02,090
Why?

27
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,780
Because ever since your father
got this stupid video camera,

28
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,772
he thinks he has to film
everything the family does.

29
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:11,772
All right, here we are! Marsh family
gathered for another dinner.

30
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,480
Randy, we have plenty
of video of us eating dinner.

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,970
- There's Shelley.
- You excited about dinner, Shelley?

32
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,500
Turn it off, dad!

33
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,570
Oh, look! Stan's eating a tater tot.

34
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,080
Wave to the camera, Stan!

35
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,790
Jesus Christ!

36
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,050
Oh, neat-o! It's one of those
Peruvian pan flute bands!

37
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:38,947
Stan, go out and stand with 'em
so I can get a shot.

38
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,310
I will play this card
to move Kyle back seven spaces.

39
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,470
Screw you, Kyle.

40
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,633
- And all right, your turn, Kenny.
- You guys! You guys, check this out.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,719
I saw another Peruvian flute
band outside my house last night!

42
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,550
So?

43
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,650
So I just sat there and
watched them for a while.

44
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,200
Guess how much money they
made selling their crappy cds?

45
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,811
- How much?
- Over $200 bucks!

46
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,100
- $200?
- Really, are you sure?

47
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,892
I'm starting to realize it's like the
easiest job in the world.

48
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:09,914
You know? I mean we could do that!

49
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,980
- Become a Peruvian flute band?
- Yeah! Why not?

50
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,700
We get instruments and costumes

51
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,800
and then make some crappy
pan flute music cds on my computer.

52
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,430
Oh, my God! We're gonna make
so much money, you guys!

53
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:29,274
But where are we gonna get the money
to buy costumes and instruments?

54
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,220
Craig, dude, how you doing, bro?

55
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,956
- Fine.
- Oh, cool. Awesome!

56
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,810
Remember you were telling us

57
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,910
how your grandma gave you
$100 bucks for your birthday?

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,525
Craig, how would you like to
turn that $100 into $1,000?

59
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,749
Come on in, Craig,
have a seat! Welcome.

60
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,190
What do you want?

61
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,510
Craig, we have chosen you to
join our Peruvian flute band!

62
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,222
Oh, all right, Craig!

63
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,186
Like those guys you
see at all the tourist spots?

64
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:07,010
There's a reason they're everywhere,
Craig. Because they make bank.

65
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,270
We just need your money to buy
instruments and make cds.

66
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,802
And we'll double your money
in one afternoon.

67
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,530
You guys never hang out with me,
you never invite me to do stuff,

68
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,455
but now you want me to be in a band
with you because my gran gave me $100.

69
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,784
Craig, don't be an asshole.

70
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,980
I go get the money.

71
00:04:32,196 --> 00:04:35,350
All right, guys. Just like we
rehearsed it! You ready, Craig?

72
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:36,920
All right, let's jam!

73
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,470
And a one, and a two, and a...

74
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,350
Wow, that's such cultural music.

75
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,208
Very cultural, yes.

76
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,129
<i>Por favor</i>, buy our cds de musica!

77
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:58,141
<i>Gracias!</i>

78
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,079
How cultural!

79
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,433
This is awesome!

80
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:07,393
You see, Craig?

81
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:18,863
You guys can't play here.
We were here first!

82
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,740
<i>No trabajar aqui! Vaya!</i>

83
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,430
<i>No playa la musica en la
promenade! No es bueno!</i>

84
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,264
This is our Peruvian flute
band's turf. You got that?

85
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,800
- Goddammit!
<i>- No! No es bueno!</i>

86
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,768
Come on, guys!

87
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,530
Jesus christ!

88
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,250
<i>No! No es bueno! No trabajar aqui!</i>

89
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,452
Ladies and gentlemen, our nation
and our world is facing an economic

90
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,134
and ecological crisis
of disastrous proportions.

91
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:15,410
I'm talking of course
about Peruvian flute bands.

92
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,135
The red dots indicate where the highest
concentration of Peruvian bands are.

93
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:25,160
All over the world, wherever
there are tourists or shoppers,

94
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,655
there are now on average

95
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:29,892
65 Peruvian flute bands
per square kilometer.

96
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,490
General?

97
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,569
France, Japan, and the northeastern US
are currently the hardest hit.

98
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,850
Make no mistake...

99
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,069
this is a pan flute epidemic.

100
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,034
A pandemic?

101
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,846
Three countries in Asia,
and seven in Europe

102
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:48,970
have already asked for our help in
getting rid of their Peruvian bands.

103
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,581
We will need every resource
available to see this through.

104
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,001
Excuse me, but aid other countries?

105
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,320
Senator?

106
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,940
With all due respect, we need to be
dealing with our own pan flute bands.

107
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,870
Let other countries
fend for themselves.

108
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,928
You heartless bastard.

109
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,932
This country was founded on
beliefs in freedom and integrity.

110
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:13,144
And we will not sit back
and do nothing

111
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:16,160
while less fortunate countries
are ravaged by Peruvian flute bands.

112
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,625
Is that clear?

113
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,504
As director of homeland security,

114
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:25,100
I am taking control of the military

115
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,618
until the crisis is contained.

116
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,545
Go, go!

117
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,378
Serves you right, assholes.

118
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:02,071
Let's go! Let's go!

119
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,781
- One more over here!
- Let's go get 'em out!

120
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,409
Clear out. Move! This is a homeland
security operation, people. Let's go!

121
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:12,080
Hey, back off!

122
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,164
Make sure all pan flute
music cds are contained.

123
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:25,010
There's Sharon and Shelley.
They're watching some television.

124
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,785
Wave to the camera, Shelley!

125
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:30,550
What are you watching, guys?

126
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,764
The news.

127
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,308
We're watching the news.

128
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,370
That's the tv in our living room.
Still showing commercials right now.

129
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,703
What you think about
the television, Shelley?

130
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,122
The news is starting!

131
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,725
<i>The government efforts to stop
the Peruvian flute band crisis</i>

132
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:50,230
<i>are now in their third day.</i>

133
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,162
<i>All over the world, flute bands
have been removed and quarantined,</i>

134
00:08:54,444 --> 00:08:56,038
<i>but more may still be out there.</i>

135
00:08:56,375 --> 00:09:00,870
<i>Homeland security is requesting that
if you see one, do not approach it.</i>

136
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,659
<i>Mark down the band's location</i>

137
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:05,965
<i>and do not under any circumstances
buy their cds.</i>

138
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,144
The flute bands contained

139
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:11,051
are being taken to a quarantine area
in Miami.

140
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,810
- Excuse us.
- Hello?

141
00:09:26,627 --> 00:09:27,778
Excuse me, sir?

142
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,241
Sir, there's been a misunderstanding.
Could I talk to you for a minute?

143
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,090
Sir, sir, could we talk
to you for just a second?

144
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,165
Get back! I'm not buying
any of your damn cds!

145
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:42,250
There's been a big misunderstanding.
We actually respect a...

146
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,950
I said I'm not buying any god
damn cds today! You got that?

147
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,550
I'm sick of it!

148
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,930
<i>Señor! Comprar cd la musica?</i>

149
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,430
Jesus christ! He shot that guy!

150
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,740
You know that money your grandma
gave you for your birthday?

151
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,920
How would you like to invest
in a Peruvian flute band?

152
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,080
You can double your
money in one afternoon.

153
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:21,504
Come on, Craig. Don't be an asshole.

154
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,270
Attention, Peruvian flute bands...

155
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,216
<i>Attenciones, bandas de flauta peru.</i>

156
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,880
We appreciate
your cooperation and patience.

157
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:37,890
<i>Cooporation y paciencia
es apreciado!</i>

158
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,142
Tomorrow, you will be
boarding ships.

159
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:43,354
<i>Manana, sera el ambarque de barcos!</i>

160
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,250
Which will take you
to Guantanamo bay.

161
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,560
<i>Que le llevara a bahia Guantanamo!</i>

162
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,290
Where you will spend
the rest of your lives.

163
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,866
<i>Donde pasar el resto
de sus vidas! Gracias!</i>

164
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,450
Guantanamo bay?

165
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,476
We can't go to Guantanamo bay!

166
00:11:01,805 --> 00:11:02,820
Don't worry.

167
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,876
I'm sure our parents are freaking
out right now trying to find us.

168
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,457
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker,

169
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:12,425
our boys were last seen
hanging out with your son Craig.

170
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:14,560
Do you have any idea
where they could have gone?

171
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,200
No! I'm telling you this
isn't like Craig at all.

172
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:20,182
- I'm really worried!
- You've checked with the police?

173
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,394
Nobody knows anything.
It's like the boys just vanished.

174
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,244
None of the other kids
have seen them since the...

175
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:28,354
Randy, will you put that thing down!

176
00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:31,090
What is wrong with you?
Our son is missing!

177
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,930
I'm worried about him too.

178
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,864
Well, then stop being
an idiot and help!

179
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,105
Maybe the boys all ran away.

180
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:39,035
Were any of your boys
upset about anything?

181
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:42,188
All we know is they were seen hanging
out with Craig and now they're gone.

182
00:11:42,308 --> 00:11:44,790
This is exactly why I've told
Kyle not to hang around that boy!

183
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:46,510
What is that supposed to mean?

184
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,590
To be honest, mrs. Tucker, we think
Craig is a bad influence on our boys.

185
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,143
Now wait just a minute!

186
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:54,357
I'm just saying that your son
has some problems.

187
00:11:54,477 --> 00:11:56,120
Like every kid doesn't
have problems!

188
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,446
Obviously Craig has gotten
them into some kind of trouble!

189
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:00,609
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, this is good!

190
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,770
Sir, good news.
Looks like we did it.

191
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,565
Every major city is reporting zero
Peruvian flute bands. We got 'em all.

192
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,525
All right! We did it! Thank God!

193
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:14,350
Calm down, people.
We still have work to do.

194
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,167
We have to take out the place
these flute bands came from,

195
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:18,840
so they never come again.

196
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,991
We don't know
where they came from, sir.

197
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:23,913
We've been researching,
but we can't figure it out.

198
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,930
Well, think about it, idiot.

199
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,086
Where else would Peruvian
flute bands come from?

200
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:35,091
The country is in the name!

201
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,540
No, sir, we checked the entire map.

202
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,410
There isn't a country
called "Peruvian" anywhere.

203
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,910
Not "Peruvian", retards.
Peru! It's right here!

204
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,434
Peru.

205
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,562
Now I want a plan in place to
take Peru out once and for all.

206
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,490
Is that really necessary, sir?

207
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,290
Seems a little extreme.

208
00:12:55,263 --> 00:12:57,669
Peruvian bands will never
stop annoying us

209
00:12:57,789 --> 00:12:59,538
unless they are stopped
at the source!

210
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:01,210
Sir, you better come quick.

211
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,200
One of the pan flute bands
was caught trying to escape.

212
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,009
You see? Goddammit!

213
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:12,044
"The llama brothers.
Tapas and moodscapes."

214
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,088
This is a mistake, sir.
We aren't really a Peruvian flute band.

215
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,591
Right. You just play
pan flute music at the mall

216
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:21,971
and sell CDs of you with an llama
but you're not a Peruvian flute band.

217
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,240
We're just kids, you know?
We were trying to make some money.

218
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,640
We just want to go home!

219
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,687
Sir, please. I'm supposed to get
laid for the first time on Saturday.

220
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,200
Which tourist location
were they playing at?

221
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,260
An outdoor mall in Colorado.

222
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,800
Look, we're from Colorado.
We grew up in the United States!

223
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,130
- We speak english!
- And we're white!

224
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:43,659
Let me talk to you guys out here.

225
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:47,913
- What do you think?
- I don't know what to make of it, sir.

226
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:50,190
It's like nothing
I've ever seen before.

227
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,721
Clearly they are a Peruvian flute band
and yet they aren't.

228
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:58,005
They play pan flute music like
the others, but they talk and act like

229
00:13:58,394 --> 00:14:00,226
- one of us.
- I agree.

230
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,512
They are obviously
some kind of hybrid.

231
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:05,932
A hybrid? How is that possible?

232
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:08,469
Perhaps a Peruvian flute band mated

233
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:10,588
- with one of our females.
- Who knows?

234
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:13,479
However, they came to be, they're about
the only piece of good luck

235
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:14,939
- we've had.
- Sir?

236
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:17,193
If they are the hybrid
we're talking about,

237
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:21,474
then they could be our way
of taking out Peru once and for all.

238
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:27,840
Do you guys know why nobody else
at school likes hanging out with you?

239
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:30,870
Because you're always doing
stuff like this.

240
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,270
You're always coming up
with some stupid idea to do something

241
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,003
and then it backfires and then
you end up in a foreign country

242
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:37,793
or in outer space or something.

243
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,592
That's why nobody likes
hanging out with you guys.

244
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,845
You're being extremely negative.

245
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,664
All right, here's the deal.

246
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:49,994
Maybe you are on our side and maybe
you aren't, but if you help us,

247
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:51,727
- we'll get you home.
- Help you how?

248
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:54,208
You are able to walk amongst
the Peruvian flute bands.

249
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:57,967
They see you as one of them. We are
going to send you to their capital.

250
00:14:58,742 --> 00:15:00,220
Can we please just go home, sir?

251
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,550
We still don't know
who's side you're on!

252
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,170
You do this and we'll know.

253
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,200
You leave for Peru in the morning.

254
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:09,700
- I am not going to Peru! Not Peru!
- Calm down.

255
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,455
You know I can't go there!

256
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:14,250
One of our friends was raped in Peru.
It was very traumatic.

257
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,670
You don't have a choice.

258
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:22,436
Either you go to Peru, or you get locked
up forever with the other flute bands.

259
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,458
Thompson, can you come over here?

260
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:30,246
The flute band players won't
shut up about something

261
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:34,102
- and I can't understand them.
- <i>Por favor! No podemos ir!</i>

262
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:36,859
<i>Estamos aqui para proteger
a ustedes!</i>

263
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,899
<i>- Si, no podemis ir!
- Que son protectores.</i>

264
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:42,754
They're saying something like
you can't send us away.

265
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,115
- We are the protectors.
- Protectors from what?

266
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,796
<i>La muerte peludo!</i>

267
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:49,311
<i>La muerte peludo!</i>

268
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,346
- What does that mean?
- I think he said,

269
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:55,583
"the furry death."

270
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,773
<i>La muerte peludo!</i>

271
00:15:58,395 --> 00:15:59,945
<i>La muerte peludo!</i>

272
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,757
<i>This is CNN.</i>

273
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:05,935
The last of the Peruvian flute bands

274
00:16:06,055 --> 00:16:09,013
have successfully been eradicated
from every part of the world.

275
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:12,183
Paul Harris is at the shopping
promenade. And Paul,

276
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:15,795
pretty nice not having any Peruvian
flute music there i suspect?

277
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,813
Really welcome silence, Tom.

278
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,300
There hasn't been a Peruvian pan
flute band in sight for days now

279
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,560
and everyone has really
been enjoying the peace.

280
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,366
The world can breathe a collective sigh
of relief now as we thank the...

281
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:34,913
What the...?

282
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:37,107
Oh, my God!

283
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:38,542
Jesus Christ!

284
00:16:42,844 --> 00:16:44,548
There's something else here!

285
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,895
It's not a Peruvian flute band.
It's...

286
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:48,594
Oh, my god. What is that thing?

287
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:50,410
What are you seeing?

288
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,583
It's furry.

289
00:16:51,806 --> 00:16:53,239
It's very furry!

290
00:16:56,967 --> 00:17:00,254
Okay. Obviously something
different has shown up.

291
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,289
Did he say "furry"?

292
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:07,577
Okay, we are experiencing some...

293
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,995
My god! What is that thing?

294
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,521
All right. We're about
800 kilometers from Peru.

295
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:30,630
There will be a truck
to take you inside the border

296
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,254
where you'll be briefed
on mission specifics.

297
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:40,205
Was there ever a moment

298
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:44,083
when you first came up with the genius
plan to become a Peruvian flute band

299
00:17:44,203 --> 00:17:46,563
that any of you said,
"hey, you know,

300
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:48,748
"this plan might backfire?"

301
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,873
That never occurs to you.

302
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,586
Because you guys are jerks
and you never learn from your mistakes.

303
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,915
And that's why everyone at school
thinks you guys are assholes.

304
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,322
That's not true!
Kids at school like us!

305
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:05,580
- Don't they?
- Dude, kids at school totally like us.

306
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,498
Craig's just being a dick because
we're having a tough time right now.

307
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:10,224
I'm being a dick.

308
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:11,363
Yes!

309
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,540
You guys took my birthday money,
got me arrested and sent to Miami

310
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,922
with no way home except
to take down the county of Peru

311
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,488
and I'm being a dick.

312
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,167
- There's no talking to this guy.
- All right, fine. When we get back home

313
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:26,930
we'll get you your money back,
and never talk to you again. How's that?

314
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,920
That would be great. Thank you.

315
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,439
This is wrong.
This just doesn't make any sense.

316
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,220
Why would homeland security
send us into Peru?

317
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,449
Because they were starting
to take over the world?

318
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:39,158
I don't know. I just feel like

319
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:41,990
there's got to be
something else going on here.

320
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:47,424
Please, I don't know where else to turn.
The police haven't been any help.

321
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:50,670
I think our boys might really be
in trouble this time.

322
00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:55,846
Yes, please check
and call me right back. Thank you.

323
00:18:57,342 --> 00:19:00,040
Randy, I swear to god
if you don't put that thing away...

324
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,020
You're going to be glad I have
all this footage of the family some day.

325
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:05,248
I mean it, Randy. That's enough!

326
00:19:05,368 --> 00:19:07,794
You don't have
to videotape every single...

327
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,267
What the hell was that?

328
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:14,700
Oh, my God!

329
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,142
Something's going on outside.
Stay here.

330
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,163
- What's going on, dad?
- Get back to your room!

331
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:33,520
- What's going on?
- They're all over the place!

332
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,872
- What are?
- They're really furry!

333
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,308
What did that?

334
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,395
What is that thing?

335
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,149
Mr. Marsh, you have to move.
It isn't safe to be here.

336
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:03,137
Oh, my God!

337
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,374
Go, go back the other way!

338
00:20:12,147 --> 00:20:13,275
Oh, god!

339
00:20:16,968 --> 00:20:18,037
I'm so...

340
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:19,494
startled.

341
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:31,660
Sir, we've got a bigger problem.

342
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:34,920
And what might that be?

343
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,790
News reports are coming in
from cities all over the world.

344
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,554
Word of massive destruction
and death by what appear to be...

345
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:44,683
Guinea pigs?

346
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,205
Yes, sir.

347
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:49,381
How did you know?

348
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:53,204
You were so close
to figuring it all out, Davis.

349
00:20:53,324 --> 00:20:54,611
Did you know that?

350
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,593
- Sir?
- I really thought, you had me at Miami.

351
00:20:57,976 --> 00:21:01,097
But you just couldn't quite
put the pieces together.

352
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:04,515
You...

353
00:21:04,952 --> 00:21:06,518
knew this was going to happened.

354
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:09,067
This is only the beginning.

355
00:21:09,497 --> 00:21:11,434
And I can't let you interfere.

356
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,221
Sorry, my friend. But I work too hard
to make all this happen.

357
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:28,056
The pan flute bands are
on their way to their deaths,

358
00:21:28,176 --> 00:21:29,820
and the guinea pigs are rising.

359
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,042
And the only person
who could have stopped all this...

360
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:36,377
is on his way
to the middle of nowhere.
