1
00:00:04,281 --> 00:00:05,981
My shift hasn't started
yet. Try that guy.

2
00:00:05,982 --> 00:00:07,080
Who, that guy right there?

3
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:07,864
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:08,619
All right, thank you.

5
00:00:10,256 --> 00:00:11,981
A lot's been going on around
here the last two weeks.

6
00:00:11,982 --> 00:00:15,073
Turk and Carla got married,
that short guy hurt his hand...

7
00:00:15,828 --> 00:00:18,828
And since I totally broke Elliot's heart,
I was still trying to smooth things over.

8
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:21,359
Hey, buddy. What's
with the giant needle?

9
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:28,377
We still had some work to do.

10
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:34,148
Where was I? Oh, yeah. The hospital
also had a new attending psychologist.

11
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:39,245
Dr... Molly... Clock.

12
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:46,071
This is a really windy hospital.

13
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:49,564
Oh, I'm sorry. I was
drying up a patient's urine.

14
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:51,078
Hmm.

15
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,079
I'm kind of a
favorite around here!

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,275
Not only was Dr. Clock easy on the eyes,
but apparently she was an excellent shrink.

17
00:00:57,276 --> 00:01:00,858
Mr. Witcomb is in the middle of a psychotic
break from self-discontinuation of his meds,

18
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:02,854
so we need to get him
on Haloperidol IV stat.

19
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,807
But I also heard she was a little spacy.

20
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:06,541
So where were we?

21
00:01:07,582 --> 00:01:09,589
Um... we weren't talking.

22
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,104
Was it 'cause of something you did, 'cause I am
totally over it. I don't even remember what it was.

23
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:15,708
No, I mean like we've
never talked... ever.

24
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,145
Well how do I know your name, then?

25
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:18,102
You don't.

26
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:19,449
You're freakin' me out, Jimmy!

27
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,337
It's Johnny.

28
00:01:20,338 --> 00:01:22,124
Why would you say
"Johnny"? You hate "Johnny"!

29
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,954
Now I'm gonna commit
it to my memory forever.

30
00:01:26,028 --> 00:01:27,627
Johnny... Johnny... Johnny...

31
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:28,753
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,232
Okay,
Johnny...

33
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:31,151
Dammit!

34
00:01:31,152 --> 00:01:33,432
I'm sorry, I'm just meeting so many
people, and everyone's kind of cliquish

35
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:34,946
and I haven't really
gotten to know anybody.

36
00:01:34,947 --> 00:01:37,172
So let's talk! It's not like
I'm going anywhere, right?

37
00:01:37,173 --> 00:01:39,083
Great! Oh,
thanks. Okay.

38
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:41,759
'Scuse me.

39
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:44,251
Turk's back from his honeymoon!

40
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:48,045
Nice to meet you...!

41
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:51,291
TURK! HEY!

42
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:54,527
Go ahead.

43
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:56,135
JAAAAAAAY DEEEEEEEE!

44
00:01:58,508 --> 00:01:59,471
Whooooa, J.D.! J.D.!

45
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:02,364
Maybe some day he'll love me like that.

46
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,375
He's here! TURK!

47
00:02:07,038 --> 00:02:08,143
JAAAAAAAY DEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

48
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:10,562
TUUUUUUUUUUUURK!

49
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:16,419
TURK?!

50
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,494
J.D.!

51
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:21,056
J.D.?!

52
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,149
TURK!

53
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:25,276
DUDE!

54
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:26,915
Stay right there! I'm so excited!

55
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:31,913
AWWWW, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

56
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:32,896
The roof!

57
00:02:32,897 --> 00:02:34,248
I'LL HOLLA!

58
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:37,650
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, FROM NOW ON,
WE'RE CALLING THIS "ROOF A".

59
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:38,776
GOT IT!

60
00:02:47,477 --> 00:02:48,106
TURK!

61
00:02:55,921 --> 00:03:00,646
Well, well, well... What do we have
here? The newlyweds! Oh, and, hey Carla.

62
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:06,648
Mark my words, the first year of marriage is just
a real treat! Sweetheart, do you remember ours?

63
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:08,767
The silly fighting for control!

64
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:10,258
You broke my jaw!

65
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:12,704
You gotta stop that back-talk
early. Come on, glass jaw.

66
00:03:12,705 --> 00:03:17,973
Duck and move, Gandhi. Here it is, here
it is, watch it - ohhhh, duck and move.

67
00:03:17,974 --> 00:03:23,688
Ignore him, baby. We have a great
relationship. Nothing's gonna change.

68
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:27,004
Over the next few days, Carla
started to change everything.

69
00:03:29,672 --> 00:03:31,755
Hey, dude, get us some more ice cream.

70
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:39,543
First of all, this is a Rice Dream - mm, ricey -
secondly, I can't get out of these new chairs she got.

71
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:40,728
Am I using it right?

72
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:45,873
These bowls Carla bought don't hold a lot of
Rice Dream. I can barely get my spoon in it. Look.

73
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:49,017
Hey, J.D.? Although we do
appreciate the wedding gift...

74
00:03:49,994 --> 00:03:52,650
Turk and I decided we don't want
this Sugar Hill Gang alarm clock.

75
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:53,709
We don't?

76
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:56,933
I got it.

77
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:01,569
Whoa. I got it. I'm okay. I
don't... here it goes. Whoa!

78
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,716
I'm still in the chair!
It's like a bear-trap!

79
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:13,228
As I fondled Katya, my pillow girlfriend, I
thought about how things had changed for all of us.

80
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,756
You see, I had almost forgotten that when I wake
up, it'll be the start of my last week as a resident.

81
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:40,904
Snooze!

82
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,286
Scrubs 4x01

83
00:04:48,342 --> 00:04:54,064
Synchro: foromuser10 pour forom.
com Transcripts sur www. mopnt. com

84
00:05:06,543 --> 00:05:07,566
Don't look at me, it just fell.

85
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:10,655
Please please please please please please
please please please please please please please!

86
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:11,964
Proceed unmolested.

87
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:15,840
I knew he'd buy it, because today feels
like one of those great days in the hospital.

88
00:05:15,841 --> 00:05:17,894
People really seem to be
getting to know each other.

89
00:05:17,895 --> 00:05:20,623
Bob, Bob, Bob... Bob... Bob...

90
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:22,827
Fantastic. Get off my face.

91
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,186
My last week of residency had begun. In
seven days I'd be a full-fledged doctor.

92
00:05:28,187 --> 00:05:32,417
It felt pretty special to me, and I had a hunch
it meant a lot to one other person as well.

93
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:34,399
Yes, milady?

94
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,462
Sooo, ya felling all, like, blalala!

95
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:41,023
That depends, does "blalalala" mean
confused and incredibly annoyed?

96
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:45,497
Come on, man, it's our last week together! The
J.D. and Cox train is pulling into the station.

97
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:48,621
You must have a metaphor you
want to use; hit me with it!

98
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:54,073
I suppose I could riff a list of things that I
care as little about as our last week together.

99
00:05:54,074 --> 00:06:01,198
Lemme see, uhh... Low-carb diets. Michael
Moore. The Republican National Convention.

100
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,593
Kabbalah and all Kabbalah-related products.
Hi-def TV, the Bush daughters, wireless hot spots,

101
00:06:07,594 --> 00:06:11,981
'The O.C.', the U.N., recycling, getting Punk'd,
Danny Gans, the Latin Grammys, the real Grammys.

102
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:17,052
Jeff, that Wiggle who sleeps too darn much! The Yankees
payroll, all the red states, all the blue states,

103
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:20,889
every hybrid car, every talk show host! Everything
on the planet, everything in the solar system,

104
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:26,019
everything everything everything everything
everything everything that exists - past, present

105
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,723
and future, in all discovered
and undiscovered dimensions.

106
00:06:30,798 --> 00:06:33,304
Oh! And Hugh Jackman.

107
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:38,504
Hugh Jackman's Wolverine! How dare he.

108
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:40,747
I missed you guys so much.

109
00:06:40,748 --> 00:06:43,367
Oh, come over tonight!
We're looking at wedding pictures.

110
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:48,510
Ooh! There's this one picture of me right after
I got sick off my... third champagne and Red Bull,

111
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:52,248
and my hair is kind of like sexy-messy,
and the photographer said he could airbrush

112
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:53,416
all of the puke off my dress.

113
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:54,482
Already made doubles.

114
00:06:54,483 --> 00:07:00,062
You rock! So, is
J.D. gonna be there tonight?

115
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:01,571
Can't you come over anyway?

116
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:02,721
Um...

117
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,779
Hey! Do you guys mind if I eat with
you? 'Cause I don't wanna sit alone

118
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,366
and sing to my food like a crazy person.

119
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,334
Oh, my gosh! I do that!

120
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,364
No way!

121
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,262
Mostly pop songs. You know,
unless I'm eating soul food.

122
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,022
Where's your food?

123
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:16,921
Oh, shoot.

124
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:20,370
Look, Elliot, we'll do something
later this week, just the two of us.

125
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:22,432
Okay.

126
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,072
Ahh. Oh, that is not my food.
But I'm not getting up again.

127
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:28,201
Oh, I wouldn't.

128
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:31,377
Chicken salaaaad! Oh, yeeah. Looks good.

129
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:36,053
I gotta go. See ya.

130
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:42,705
It's so strange feeling all alone when like a month
ago I was part of this really tight group, you know?

131
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:45,571
Yeah. I had tons of
friends at my old hospital.

132
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:47,656
I gotta meet some new people.

133
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,539
Do you wanna, uh, get
a cup of coffee tonight?

134
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:54,270
Can't. I'm hitting the internet
hard and going on a friend hunt!

135
00:07:57,287 --> 00:08:01,888
Oh, chicken salaaad! You're tasty,
you're food to be eaten, it's good!

136
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:08,549
When you get back from surgery, Mrs. Grodberg, we'll
play Scrabble again! And this time I'll beat you!

137
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,425
Well, of course you'll beat her, son, she's
having half her brain removed! Heh-heh!

138
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:16,957
J.D. A little problem
this morning with Malik.

139
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:19,120
Our car? Is it bad?

140
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:25,829
Hey, Triple A? Look, I need a
pick-up on the corner of Fourth and-

141
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:33,276
You know what? You'll see it.

142
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:37,054
Ah, Malik. Lots of
memories in that old car.

143
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,337
Of what?

144
00:08:38,338 --> 00:08:39,754
Driving, mostly.

145
00:08:40,577 --> 00:08:41,390
Beep, beep.

146
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:45,635
Look, why don't we pool our money together and
buy one of those nice cute little Mini Coopers?

147
00:08:46,754 --> 00:08:47,642
Baby, a Mini Cooper?

148
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,916
And then the most
amazing thing happened.

149
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:53,948
I'll tell you what, Turk. Why
don't you go pick out our car.

150
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,621
Carla let Turk make a decision!

151
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:02,317
Okay! But, baby, you should know that it's not gonna
be a Mini. 'Cause ain't nothing really mini about me!

152
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:03,427
There isn't.

153
00:09:03,428 --> 00:09:04,911
There isn't! Heh!

154
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:11,836
Mr. Radford, if you keep turning
down physical therapy, you're never

155
00:09:11,837 --> 00:09:13,442
gonna be strong enough
to get out of this bed.

156
00:09:14,294 --> 00:09:15,002
I'm tired.

157
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:17,378
I know you are, but I would
love it if you'd at least try.

158
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:31,467
"And I would do anything for love, but
I won't do that. No, I won't do that. "

159
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:32,478
Haunting.

160
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,392
Drink your juice, Mr. Blass.

161
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:39,108
Mr. Blass has Pick's disease, which is similar
to presentation to multi-infarct dementia.

162
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:40,108
Mmm.

163
00:09:40,109 --> 00:09:42,738
Anyhoo, he likes to sing when he gets up in
the morning, and the weird thing is, Johnny,

164
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,985
he actually captures
the mood of the room.

165
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:47,712
Okay, you gotta take a stand on this
"Johnny" thing before it becomes permanent.

166
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:52,897
You know what, it's "J.D." for "John Dorian," so
John... look, you know what, Johnny's fine, it's cool.

167
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:53,934
What's wrong with you?

168
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:57,212
Anyway, Johnny, I was noticing that you were having
some trouble motivating your patient back in there,

169
00:09:57,213 --> 00:10:01,127
and I actually published a paper on motivation
methodology in post-operative seniors,

170
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:03,235
so, if you want, I could help.

171
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,253
What floor?

172
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:06,232
Oh, my god, we're on an elevator.

173
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:11,281
You know, Molly, I appreciate the offer, but
there's a very special doctor I use around here

174
00:10:11,282 --> 00:10:14,353
when I need help, and he'd be pretty
pissed if I didn't come to him first.

175
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:19,050
Why, Mariska? Why do you insist
on bothering me with these things?

176
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,443
Please, you know you love it. Now, come
on, one more time for nostalgia's sake:

177
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:25,879
You come see my patient, you teach me a
lesson, and then the music plays, right?

178
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:33,876
In my head, it sounds like this...

179
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,247
Dr. Cox, can I borrow you for a minute?

180
00:10:36,248 --> 00:10:42,539
Borrow me? Dearheart, you'd be rescuing me.
Newbie, you're on your own. Get used to it.

181
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:59,066
I'munna prove to you why my first year of
marriage isn't gonna be as hard as yours was.

182
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,493
I think you're setting the bar a little
low on that one, there, sweetcheeks.

183
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,318
Yeah, still, the point
is I'm smarter than you.

184
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:04,302
In relationships?

185
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:05,125
In everything.

186
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:05,731
Right!

187
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,525
See, even though I make all the decisions,
whenever I see Turk is getting upset,

188
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:13,070
I throw him a little decision that means nothing
to me. Like buying a new car as long as

189
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:15,425
it's got four wheels and
air conditioning, I'm hap...

190
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:16,686
...py.

191
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:19,589
Check it, baby! Scooters!

192
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,517
Hehhh.

193
00:11:21,518 --> 00:11:22,527
Fantastic!

194
00:11:28,282 --> 00:11:29,056
He's a drinker!

195
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:34,686
Clever. Look, J.D., I think this is so unfair.
I mean, I never get to see Turk and Carla anymore.

196
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:37,581
It's like we got divorced and you get to keep
the friends just because you live with them.

197
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:42,465
It just feels like you guys are part
of some sort of gang or something.

198
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:46,936
Elliot, you're overreacting.
We're not some kind of gang, okay?

199
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:48,440
Okay.

200
00:11:49,514 --> 00:11:51,903
Wolverines, let's roll!

201
00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:01,728
That joyride around the hospital
made me realize two things.

202
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:07,056
First, it's a bad idea to take a full bladder
out on your hog. Also, I had to draw upon

203
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:09,538
all my medical experience to
get Mr. Radford out of bed.

204
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:11,901
Mr. Radford, they're showing
'Cocoon' in the chapel!

205
00:12:11,902 --> 00:12:14,186
I'm not a big Guttenberg fan.

206
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:17,197
Well, you're the only one, 'cause
people in the hall are going crazy!

207
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:23,822
Akbar. Akbar. Akbar. Oh, Johnny! Hey!

208
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:25,930
Run away with me?

209
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:28,338
I was just looking at
Mr. Radford's chart.

210
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:32,421
Ahh, I know you're new here, but that's my patient's
chart, and no one touches my patient's chart

211
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:33,418
except for him.

212
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,857
Yes! I knew he couldn't stay away.

213
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:38,364
Hi, I'm Molly. And I kinda tagged in here
with the Mr. Radford thing, 'cause I-

214
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:40,626
Molly, Molly, Molly,
you lost me at "hello. "

215
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,109
Wow, no touchy.

216
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:48,069
Fair enough. Uhh, Mr. Radford, do I understand you
have pain issues but you don't want physical therapy?

217
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,016
I just don't have it in me.

218
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:52,985
Here comes the magic. He
always gives me goosebumps.

219
00:12:52,986 --> 00:12:57,721
Okay, then. I sure hope you're comfortable
in that bed, because you're gonna be in one

220
00:12:57,722 --> 00:12:59,749
just like it for the rest
of your natural born life.

221
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,648
What the hell was that?

222
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,943
That... was me talking to a patient who has thrown
in the towel. You can't save everyone, Newbie,

223
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:11,923
so I suggest you start working with people who
want your help. That's what I will be doing.

224
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:15,242
Goosebumps?

225
00:13:15,243 --> 00:13:17,714
They're small.
And you can't see them.

226
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:30,213
Ahh, Mrs. Grodberg,
"jizelbck" is not a word.

227
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:32,320
I'm still beating you!

228
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:36,221
Well, I'm just glad your surgery went okay and you
still have your A game. I don't really care who wins!

229
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,556
Half a brain, dammit!

230
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:39,079
Goodnight, Giselle.

231
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:40,823
Dr. Cox.

232
00:13:42,926 --> 00:13:44,705
I just want you to know I'm not
ready to give up on Mr. Radford.

233
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:48,581
Do you want me to give you my "things I don't
care about" speech again? Because, you know,

234
00:13:48,582 --> 00:13:52,442
I've updated it to include all white
guys who add -izzle to anything.

235
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:54,850
I agrizzle, my nizzle.

236
00:13:54,851 --> 00:14:00,414
Go on home and get in bed, will ya. I'm betting your
friend Mr. Radford's already in his. I'll see ya.

237
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,570
Well, sweetheart, you're here early.

238
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:19,215
Yeah, well, you know I didn't have any
plans last night, so I went to bed at 8

239
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:23,115
and then I woke up at 4. And then I realized that
the sunrise just looks beautiful through the trees,

240
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:27,875
and that my neighbor gets his paper in the
nude... and that he needs to lose like 900 pounds.

241
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:32,952
In the future, the appropriate response is, "Yes,
I am here early": it's called 'small talk',

242
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:35,745
not 'my depressing
life in thirty seconds'.

243
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:42,904
I am not, depressed, sir. In fact,
nothing is gonna get me down today!

244
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:53,858
"All by myself. Don't
wanna be all by my-"

245
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:54,913
Oh, shut up!

246
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:57,618
Did you just tell my patient to shut
up? 'Cause that seems not very doctory.

247
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:02,362
No. I mean, I said it like all those high
school girls do in the mall, like, "Oh, shut up!"

248
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:05,889
I should go.

249
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,477
Kick it, Mr. Blass.

250
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:32,437
Woohoo! Ring around the
Janitor! Pocket full of-

251
00:15:32,438 --> 00:15:33,517
You're funny. Pocket full of what?

252
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:34,609
...Zanitor.

253
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,714
Not a word!

254
00:15:40,944 --> 00:15:41,592
Why the giant X?

255
00:15:41,593 --> 00:15:42,751
Why the stupid face?

256
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:44,072
Touché.

257
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:45,919
You know, I know you
knocked that exit sign down.

258
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:50,907
Well then I'm sure I can expect an appropriate
retaliatory response. Maybe you could shoot me in the neck.

259
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:55,885
Sounds like fun, but no. Our game is over,
buddy. Your residency's coming to a close and...

260
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:58,424
that's it, nothing left to do but...

261
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:03,674
What can I say, it's been... horrifying.

262
00:16:03,675 --> 00:16:04,685
Thank you!

263
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,468
Well, this is kinda cool! Hey, you
know, maybe we could, like, be friends.

264
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:09,725
You like huntin' squirrels?

265
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:11,152
I'd never tried it.

266
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:14,557
Easiest thing in the world - all you
need are some walnuts... and a boxing glove!

267
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,701
And the day just got better from there.

268
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:24,931
Mostly because Mr. Radford had the same
"screw you, Dr. Cox" attitude that I had.

269
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:27,149
Good stuff, Mr. Radford!
I'm proud of you!

270
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,575
I hate you!

271
00:16:28,576 --> 00:16:34,278
Excuse me, doctor. I dropped a nickel in that
therapy whirlpool. You think you could get it for me?

272
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:39,528
Okay, but stand back. These
things can be pretty dangerous!

273
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:42,543
Whoa. Oh, boy. Whooooaaaa! Agghhh!

274
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,372
So, what, are they shooting some sort of
Geeks of Sacred Heart calendar out here?

275
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:02,259
Actually, no, I almost drowned diving for a
nickel; but I'm sure you're more interested

276
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:07,168
in conspiracy theories about gangs
and friend stealing. Peace out.

277
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:19,588
Hey! Why did you kick'a my scooter?
Why? All you Americans are bullies!

278
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:22,583
That is why the whole world hates you!

279
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:26,768
Easy, Massimo. It's okay, she's gonna fix it,
just go inside and I'll meet you in my office.

280
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,278
He's not even Italian.

281
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:35,240
I'm sorry. Look, um...
You wouldn't understand.

282
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:39,870
No, I get it. I mean, you're feeling lonely,
you're feeling rejected. I mean, most people

283
00:17:39,871 --> 00:17:43,055
around here won't talk to me, and
even Johnny won't take my help.

284
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:44,535
Who's Johnny?

285
00:17:44,536 --> 00:17:48,398
You know, he's a resident, he's got like gelled-up
hair, and he and his friends are in a motorcycle gang?

286
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:49,777
I knew it!

287
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:54,357
You know what, Elliot, you act like everyone's boxing you
out, but you wouldn't even get a cup of coffee with me.

288
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:57,832
Peace out, baby.

289
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,212
Why is everybody saying that?

290
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:07,054
Great news, baby. I just picked your
grandparents up from the airport!

291
00:18:09,777 --> 00:18:11,725
Hang on, Nana! Hang on, Grampa!

292
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:16,441
Not only did I get them home,
I lost six pounds! Ha ha!

293
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:17,820
Gimme those stupid keys!

294
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:18,809
Mm-mm.

295
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,739
OH!

296
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,517
That's what I think of your scooters! No
more bugs in my teeth! No more helmet head!

297
00:18:26,518 --> 00:18:31,325
No more making deals with God every time a truck
passes me on the freeway, okay? It's over! That's it!

298
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:35,346
What the hell just happened?

299
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,623
You got married, Turkleton.

300
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:43,587
That, my friends, is Mr.
Radford getting out of bed.

301
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:49,072
And that's Mr. Radford falling back into bed.
But still, enough to rub it in Dr. Cox's face.

302
00:18:50,154 --> 00:18:53,163
That is so great! But I wouldn't do that
unless you want him to rub your face in it.

303
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:56,649
Did you not see what just happened, or do
you not get face rubbing? Because it's more

304
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,693
than just a bizarro way
to memorize people's names.

305
00:18:58,694 --> 00:19:02,876
Johnny, I mean what Dr. Cox did was
classic reverse psychology. And so is this:

306
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:07,538
Behavioral modification can sometimes be
brought about through classic conditioning.

307
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:12,272
Reverse psychology? Nothing? 'Cause that
really kills at the psychiatric conferences.

308
00:19:12,273 --> 00:19:13,561
I must go to one of those.

309
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,421
Look, isn't it possible that Dr. Cox
tricked you as a motivational ploy?

310
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,191
Hmm, no.

311
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:22,364
After he said there was no hope with
Mr. Radford, didn't you both work harder?

312
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:24,619
Nnoo! You're like a crazy person!

313
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:30,021
Look, I'll tell you something else. I mean,
Dr. Cox is a text-book closed-off alpha male.

314
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:33,150
I mean, you can try forever, but you're
never gonna get that hug that you really want.

315
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:36,396
Uh, excuse me, I'm not
a child. I'm a doctor.

316
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:38,304
And I'll get that hug!

317
00:19:40,704 --> 00:19:41,560
Hey! Watch it!

318
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:45,173
Oh! Hot! Ah! Ahh!

319
00:19:45,174 --> 00:19:47,318
I, um... brought you coffee.

320
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,150
Oh, it's burning, it's like fire! Ah!

321
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:56,116
Baby, I know you don't
wanna return the scooters.

322
00:19:58,011 --> 00:20:00,975
Can't this wait till after my scooter
club's fall foliage trip through Maine?

323
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:02,067
No, Turk!

324
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,374
Meeeeaaaan!

325
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:09,067
Look! You're a husband now. When you make decisions,
you're supposed to think about what we need,

326
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:10,554
not what you want!

327
00:20:10,555 --> 00:20:15,385
Well, it doesn't seem like you're doing that!
You gave away my clock! And you sold my chairs.

328
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:17,463
And what the hell is up with
these ridiculously tiny bowls!?

329
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:19,696
They're sake cups, Jethro!

330
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:22,038
I knew that...

331
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:25,002
Everything I do, Turk, I do it for us!

332
00:20:26,223 --> 00:20:28,292
Oh, yeah? Then why does
Rowdy smell like daisies?

333
00:20:29,381 --> 00:20:31,142
'Cause I had him filled with potpourri.

334
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:36,452
You can keep the scooters.

335
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:39,142
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.

336
00:20:40,498 --> 00:20:41,287
Marriage is gonna be tricky.

337
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:42,316
Yeah.

338
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:46,537
Thanks.

339
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:52,221
How are your thighs?

340
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:54,350
They're very hot and pink.

341
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:56,994
Do you want me to rub ointment on them?

342
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:01,999
It's okay.

343
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,128
Awwwwwwww.

344
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,263
Weird.

345
00:21:12,535 --> 00:21:13,754
Ka-pow!

346
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:17,641
Look at that. I knew I smelled that
odd combination of fear and baby powder.

347
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,085
How does he know about my belly rash?

348
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:24,163
Look, Dr. Cox, I know you were using
reverse psychology with Mr. Radford.

349
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:25,757
You do, do you?

350
00:21:25,758 --> 00:21:30,229
Yes. And I figured it out all by myself, without anyone
helping me or explaining it directly in my face or anything.

351
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,425
Well, nubile one, your last
lesson and you didn't even need it.

352
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:43,732
Three years and it's finally
over. I know what you want, I do.

353
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:50,747
Come here.

354
00:21:50,748 --> 00:21:54,363
Oh, my God, it's finally happening!
Don't miss a moment! Take it all in!

355
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,810
Good God, Fantasia. You don't actually
think I'm done teaching you, do you?

356
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:07,682
D'you not understand the only difference between
today and tomorrow is that you wake up tomorrow

357
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:11,493
and start coming in here and killing people, that no
one can say, "It's no big deal, he's just a resident. "

358
00:22:11,494 --> 00:22:15,596
Instead, what they're damn sure gonna be
wondering is who tried to educate your sorry ass.

359
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:19,943
And when that finger of blame starts pointing
in my direction, I had damn sure better be

360
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:23,091
in a coma from the anger stroke I suffered
from the last time you tried to hug me.

361
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:31,116
Oh, and, uh, don't be
late tomorrow... Doctor.

362
00:22:32,692 --> 00:22:35,864
Whether or not you survive in a hospital is
all about how you handle your relationships.

363
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,315
"All by myself / Don't wanna be... "

364
00:22:44,316 --> 00:22:45,904
Whether it's a brand new one...

365
00:22:45,905 --> 00:22:48,505
"... all by myself!"

366
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,582
...or an old one you need
to figure out all over again.

367
00:22:56,452 --> 00:22:57,602
Oh, my God!

368
00:22:59,118 --> 00:23:01,170
I can't believe you did this!

369
00:23:03,063 --> 00:23:07,381
It's even minier than I
imagined! But what about you?

370
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:11,114
Ah, baby, don't worry about it,
I got it covered. Check it out.

371
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:31,713
As for me, it was my relationships
that got me through my residency.

372
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:45,301
Bull's eye!

373
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,693
We're not done with
our thing yet, are we.

374
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,736
No. For you, it's all just beginning.

375
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,431
The weird thing is, he was right.
