1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,804
<i>Even though it can be tough around here,</i>

2
00:00:03,892 --> 00:00:07,263
<i>sometimes God gives you little gifts
to get you through the day.</i>

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,115
<i>- Grab a mop...
- Shush. Watching The Sixth Sense.</i>

4
00:00:18,206 --> 00:00:20,117
There's a mess in the hallway.

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,625
- This kid sees dead people.
- That film is at least five years old.

6
00:00:24,717 --> 00:00:26,461
So what? I haven't seen it.

7
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:31,016
Bruce Willis is a ghost.

8
00:00:31,102 --> 00:00:33,642
He's been dead the entire time.

9
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:36,140
Oh! All the best.

10
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:39,155
No! No!

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,567
You guys, I'm so excited about tonight.

12
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:43,655
We're just going to a nightclub.

13
00:00:43,747 --> 00:00:46,536
No, Carla. An African-American club.

14
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:48,787
Promise me you'll be cool.

15
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:52,086
<i>In Turk's defence,
we had tried this once before.</i>

16
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:56,053
You can't touch me.

17
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:00,894
<i>And once before that.</i>

18
00:01:01,568 --> 00:01:04,274
Yeah, boy!

19
00:01:06,492 --> 00:01:08,819
Man. It's only 10.00.

20
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,118
<i>But, hey, the third time's a charm.</i>

21
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:15,252
All right, you three can go in.

22
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,132
- Word.
- Uh-uh. You're out.

23
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:20,719
- Oh, look, sir...
- Baby, I got this. Listen here, man.

24
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:24,225
He's a little out of his mizzle,
so for just a little bizzle,

25
00:01:24,312 --> 00:01:27,232
if you let him up in this pizzle,
he'll be all chizzle.

26
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:29,610
You out, too.

27
00:01:29,696 --> 00:01:32,189
Sir, this is for idiot number one,

28
00:01:32,283 --> 00:01:34,242
and this is for idiot number two.

29
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:38,118
Come on, you fool.

30
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:44,760
Oh, I knew I'd get in!

31
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:46,923
Just don't lose your head, Bambi.

32
00:01:49,937 --> 00:01:51,218
Oh!

33
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:59,232
Turk! J.D.'s doing the...

34
00:02:06,547 --> 00:02:08,006
Oh, God.

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,887
<i>After two hours
of roboting I was parched.</i>

36
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:16,850
<i>And that's when I saw Kylie.</i>

37
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:23,478
Hi. Can you make me an appletini?

38
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:25,651
I hope so. It's my favourite drink.

39
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:27,785
<i>Oh, my God. That's a sign!</i>

40
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:30,116
<i>If only she had
my goofy sense of humour.</i>

41
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,749
Out of vodka. Let me go
downstairs and get more.

42
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:41,266
I've been working on my fake stair walk.

43
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:43,180
<i>OK, time to move in for the kill.</i>

44
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:46,975
<i>Work the fact you're a doctor
into the conversation. Just be subtle.</i>

45
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,773
I'm a doctor. John Dorian.
Most of my patients live.

46
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:54,369
This is so weird.
I've been looking for a doctor...

47
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:56,664
<i>My God, look at those beautiful eyes.</i>

48
00:02:56,752 --> 00:02:59,161
<i>They're so big I can see myself in them.</i>

49
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:01,416
<i>Wow! How cute am I?</i>

50
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,462
So it's probably nothing big, but I'm
wondering if you could check it out.

51
00:03:05,558 --> 00:03:07,885
You got it.
Come by Sacred Heart tomorrow.

52
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:11,184
I have clinic hours.
After all, I'm a doctor.

53
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:14,732
You're gonna date a patient.

54
00:03:14,823 --> 00:03:18,276
I hope she has something that keeps
her here so you get to know her.

55
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,077
I gotta thank you for taking
a special interest.

56
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,661
He's just excited

57
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,289
because he wishes he dated more
sexy black women when he was single.

58
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:27,795
At least he married one.

59
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:29,215
Todd, I'm not black.

60
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:31,429
Right. And I'm not straight.

61
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:34,721
Do you ever get that special
fluttery feeling in your heart

62
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:37,685
when you feel like a woman's
about to change your life?

63
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:41,397
Hey, J. D! This is my boyfriend James.

64
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,781
Thanks again for seeing him.

65
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:46,955
How's your heart?
The fluttering has stopped.

66
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,415
There. Is she black?

67
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:05,068
Be with you in a second.

68
00:04:05,153 --> 00:04:06,613
Thanks, doc.

69
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:10,199
It's funny. I thought you said
you were the one who needed a doctor.

70
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:11,830
No. I told you it was James.

71
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:13,908
Oh. How could I not have heard that?

72
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:15,829
Remember, I said...

73
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,998
<i>My God, look at those beautiful eyes.</i>

74
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,215
<i>They're so b... You're doing it again!</i>

75
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,178
So I'll see you in there.

76
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:24,341
OK. In there I'll see you.

77
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:28,179
Oh, man! I can't believe it's over.

78
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:30,268
Dude, it's not that serious.

79
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,443
There could be a window, but you have to
get in there and fish for information.

80
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:38,450
You don't want to lose this hottie!
She is a slamming hottie, and you...

81
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,572
Turk.

82
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,957
I got this. Baby,
you know you're his world.

83
00:04:42,046 --> 00:04:45,713
I'm going for it. But, you know,
I gotta go in there hot.

84
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:48,639
Turk, what's that joke
that Mickhead always tells?

85
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:50,931
Dude, a guy walks
into a dentist's office

86
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:52,728
and says, "I think I'm a moth."

87
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:55,519
The dentist then says,
"If you think you're a moth,

88
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:57,852
why'd you come to the dentist's office?"

89
00:04:57,946 --> 00:05:00,403
The guy then says,
"Well, the light was on."

90
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,282
That moth was crazy.

91
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:05,833
Hey, I heard a great joke.

92
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:09,371
A guys walks into a dentist's office
and says, "I think I'm a moth."

93
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:11,874
The dentist says,
"If you think you're a moth,

94
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:15,137
<i>why are you in a dentist's office?"
I forgot the punch line.</i>

95
00:05:15,224 --> 00:05:18,927
<i>You can't bail out now. Stall, stall!</i>

96
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:21,312
So the moth says,

97
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:23,359
"That's a good question.

98
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:25,356
What kind of dentist are you?"

99
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:28,072
And the dentist says,
"I'm a general dentist,

100
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,321
but I do dabble in orthodontry,

101
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:33,703
braces and such," and the moth says,

102
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:36,632
"Orthodontry?
I hear there's great money in that."

103
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:37,916
<i>The light was on!</i>

104
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,512
"To answer your original question,
which was if I think I'm a moth,

105
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,302
why am I in a dentist's office,
the answer is because the light was on."

106
00:05:47,734 --> 00:05:51,437
The light. It was the light, James.
Moths love light.

107
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:55,829
So, other than your funny bone being
broken, what seems to be the problem?

108
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:58,585
Had a fever and stomach-ache
for almost a week.

109
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,995
OK, well, let's get
a little history on you.

110
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:02,834
<i>Time to go fishing for some info.</i>

111
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,800
You ever have shortness of breath,

112
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:08,721
for instance when you're walking Kylie
to the apartment that you share?

113
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,433
<i>- We don't live together.
- Window! Window!</i>

114
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:14,728
Oh, so you're waiting
until you get married.

115
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:16,612
We're not engaged.

116
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:20,365
I don't have shortness of breath,
but my right knee is a little puffy.

117
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:23,373
Maybe that's from dragging
your feet. Am I right?

118
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,452
She knows! OK.

119
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:29,082
<i>Using patient histories to your
advantage is an old doctor trick.</i>

120
00:06:29,176 --> 00:06:32,796
<i>What a doctor says and what they mean
are often two different things.</i>

121
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,890
Dr Robbins treated your husband but
we'll approach this case differently.

122
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,151
It's very comforting to have
the chief of medicine here.

123
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:44,524
I took a special interest in this case.

124
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:47,408
Thank you.

125
00:06:48,248 --> 00:06:52,118
Hey, Elliot.
Your boobies look hot today.

126
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:55,960
Mr Cheng's test results
show that he's in renal failure.

127
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:58,675
We're waiting for the results
of his blood smear.

128
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:02,266
I saw his chart before
I went to the bakery. He's got malaria.

129
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:06,271
And you were going to tell him this
after you had a sticky bun?

130
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,657
He's going to live at least another 12
hours and the bakery closes at 5.00.

131
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:13,781
But we've gotta get moving on this.
What should we do?

132
00:07:13,872 --> 00:07:17,078
Nothing. Mr Cheng
is not long for this world.

133
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,334
Do you believe that guy?

134
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:25,925
I never cease to be amazed by the depth
of his cynicism and callousness.

135
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:28,011
So what do you think we should do?

136
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:31,356
I don't care. I'm going home
to watch the Lakers play the Heat.

137
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:33,769
It's the game of the year,
Shaq versus Kobe.

138
00:07:33,863 --> 00:07:36,534
You are going to stay
and deal with this yourself.

139
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:37,898
Shaq versus Kobe?

140
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:40,072
All the best. Ooh! Let it happen.

141
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:43,037
Three, two, one.

142
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,378
What's this stretch good for?

143
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,591
It loosens up my chest.
You should probably stretch too.

144
00:07:51,683 --> 00:07:55,220
Don't need to. I got a tube of
Bengay on each one of my hamstrings.

145
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:57,058
How are things going with Kylie?

146
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,272
OK. Is there some special way
to get a black girl to like you?

147
00:08:00,364 --> 00:08:06,287
When a black girl asks you if her ass
looks big, you say, "Hell, yeah."

148
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:07,572
- All right.
- OK?

149
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:10,872
- You want to play some ball?
- Hell, yes.

150
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,715
Dr Kelso, I've thought about it,

151
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:16,923
and I am not going to just
wait for Mr Cheng to die.

152
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:18,890
- Excuse me?
- Are you kidding me?

153
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:22,430
Barbie going toe to toe with Big Bob
in a battle of the annoyings?

154
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:24,233
Well, happy birthday to me!

155
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,396
We should do an exchange transfusion.

156
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:30,323
The southpaw with the blonde bangs
and big britches comes out swinging!

157
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:33,664
The man is 72
and in multi-system organ dysfunction.

158
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,325
It's done. It's parasites one,
person zero,

159
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:38,664
If you tell that family
he's got a chance,

160
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:40,966
all you're doing is raising their hopes.

161
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,094
Oh, tremendous body blow!

162
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:45,805
Oh, and for the record,
we're not colleagues.

163
00:08:45,895 --> 00:08:47,770
I don't care what you think.

164
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:52,061
The fight goes
to the stocky middleweight

165
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:54,196
from Monroeville, Pennsylvania.

166
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,488
Perry, Mickhead called in sick.
I need you to work tonight.

167
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,954
That's all and good,
but I'm not available.

168
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:04,125
There is no chance I am missing
this game. No chance, no how.

169
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:06,376
What the...

170
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:10,256
Say, Bob, what the hell
happened in your office?

171
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:13,519
Every year, the med students
get me with a practical joke.

172
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:16,478
They messed with
the speed control on my treadmill.

173
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:27,290
What I can't figure is
how they got into my office.

174
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:29,502
Here's the key to Kelso's office.

175
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,963
And here's Nurse Tisdale's phone number.

176
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:35,470
I don't have any idea how
they might've gotten in here, Bob.

177
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:38,726
If you think I'm missing
the biggest game of the year...

178
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:43,442
I hate to interrupt, but I'm still woozy
from being shot into my wall,

179
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:48,075
so why don't you just go work your shift
and use my VCR to tape the game?

180
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,699
When did you get this?

181
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,914
Right about the time
we couldn't afford that MRI machine.

182
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:57,925
Of course you did.

183
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,097
Hey, Kylie, I wrote down
that moth joke for you.

184
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:02,808
Wow.

185
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,564
<i>Give her a compliment.
Tell her she has a huge ass.</i>

186
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,974
- You...
- What happened to your eye?

187
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:10,987
It's a little embarrassing.
I was playing basket...

188
00:10:11,073 --> 00:10:14,076
Embarrassing for me, actually.
See... Wingman time.

189
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:15,822
We were playing basketball,

190
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:18,667
and he scored eight buckets
in a row on yours truly.

191
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,496
- I alley-ooped him.
- Shut up.

192
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:23,128
You could've used J.D. At Seton Hall.

193
00:10:23,217 --> 00:10:27,052
The soup kitchen where you volunteer
called... You played at Seton Hall?

194
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,516
All four years.

195
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:31,687
- Get out of here!
- Did the soup kitchen have a message?

196
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:34,941
They're out of broth. What was
it like playing college ball?

197
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:38,481
Sweetie, I'm gonna go
to the cafeteria and get you a coffee.

198
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:41,578
Hell, no! Sweetie ain't drinking
no cafeteria coffee.

199
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:45,284
Sweetie, you are drinking
the coffee from the doctors' lounge.

200
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,049
Let's... Seton Hall, huh? Yeah!

201
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:50,292
Thank you.

202
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:53,508
It's the test results.
Let's see what's going on.

203
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:57,136
Your gramstain shows that you have...

204
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,983
You have gonorrhoea.

205
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:05,987
We should probably test Kylie
to see if she's infected.

206
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,745
No, we haven't slept together, yet.
It's not like I'm missing out.

207
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:13,703
I probably got it from my secretary.
Or that trainer from the gym.

208
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,754
Or this fine chick Tamyra
that bartends with Kylie.

209
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,340
Yeah!

210
00:11:18,431 --> 00:11:21,006
We should probably get you fixed up

211
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:24,105
or things might start
falling off of you.

212
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,935
Listen up.

213
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:29,611
I have been cursed to work
the night shift with you chuckleheads,

214
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:32,536
which means I have to tape
the Laker-Heat game,

215
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,291
and seeing as no one
in the history of this germbox

216
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,912
has ever made made it through a shift
without saying, "Oh, my God!

217
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:42,673
<i>Did you see what happened last night
on America's Fattest Fatties?</i>

218
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:44,969
A 900-pound woman
lost a pound and a half

219
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:47,134
and cried for 20 minutes." Be warned.

220
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:50,230
If you utter a word
about the score of the game,

221
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:53,900
it will be your last. Now get out!

222
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:56,741
Go, go, go, go! Chop, chop!

223
00:11:56,826 --> 00:11:58,985
<i>What drives people to seek revenge?</i>

224
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,493
So... you don't want to know
the ending of something.

225
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:07,128
I can relate to that.

226
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:08,677
What is that in your lap?

227
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,049
Leonard. Half-kitten, half-monkey.

228
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:17,938
Unfortunately, with his system failing,

229
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:20,982
Dr Reid and I have agreed
there's nothing more we can do.

230
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,195
<i>What drives people
to go back on their word?</i>

231
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,079
If we do an exchange transfusion,

232
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:28,372
there's a chance
we can save your father.

233
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,131
Oh! Thank you, thank you!

234
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:33,172
Thank you, thank you!

235
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:35,052
You have to keep this between us.

236
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:38,009
You know, doctor-patient
confidentiality, right?

237
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,640
<i>And what do you do
when every fibre of your being</i>

238
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:43,269
<i>wants to say something,
but you know you can't.</i>

239
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:45,934
Hey! What are you guys talking about?

240
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,278
Nothing.

241
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:59,499
Why do all the good ones have
boyfriends with venereal diseases,

242
00:12:59,593 --> 00:13:02,679
but you can't say anything
cos you're the guy's doctor?

243
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,842
I am so sick of men screwing women over,

244
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:08,805
like cheating on them or using your
lavender bath gel to wash their car.

245
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:10,774
You did not just compare cheating

246
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:13,318
and getting gonorrhoea
to me using your soap.

247
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:17,953
I'm just saying men let you down.
J.D., you have to tell her.

248
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:21,956
J.D. Took the Hippocratic oath.
There's no way around it.

249
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:27,625
Is there an "A"?

250
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:30,296
Yes, there is.

251
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,137
Yes!

252
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:35,730
There may be a way around it.

253
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:37,692
Thanks.

254
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:45,536
Ooh! Barbie, you are up there
without a net this time.

255
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,082
I sure do hope Mr Cheng rallies for you

256
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:52,171
because if he doesn't, you're gonna
be hearing Bob Kelso's voice saying,

257
00:13:52,261 --> 00:13:55,963
"Sweetheart, I told you so"
from now until you're two inches shorter

258
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:59,346
and driving around Florida
with your left-hand blinker on.

259
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,231
Now it's time to ruin the game.

260
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:04,604
- Come with me to the window.
- Do you have some elaborate plan?

261
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:08,318
I do. I convinced everybody
that's afraid of me to go outside

262
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:10,072
and spell out the score.

263
00:14:10,164 --> 00:14:12,242
- Really?
- No, you idiot.

264
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:14,827
I'm just gonna tell you
the score of the game,

265
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,296
maybe knock your head against the glass.

266
00:14:17,384 --> 00:14:20,340
I was way out of line telling
you how that movie ended,

267
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:23,006
but, God save me, watching sports

268
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:26,188
is one of the last pure
pleasures I have left in my life,

269
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:28,564
so you tell me what's it gonna take

270
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:31,227
for you to let me go home,
sit in my massage chair,

271
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:33,068
and enjoy the game?

272
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:37,489
I would like to perform
open heart surgery.

273
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,254
- No.
- How about you perform surgery on me

274
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,581
- so that I can breathe underwater?
- No.

275
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:45,428
- I would like a shark that read minds.
- No.

276
00:14:45,513 --> 00:14:48,088
- You and I trade lives for a year.
- No.

277
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:50,806
A meal and an hour
in your massage chair?

278
00:14:50,896 --> 00:14:53,270
- Done.
- Done.

279
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:58,731
Hey, guys, it's off.

280
00:15:02,957 --> 00:15:06,209
Wow! You guys are organised.

281
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:11,293
Hey, did you catch
that Lakers-Heat game?

282
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:13,381
Five seconds left...

283
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,519
I can't believe you make
$300 in tips a night.

284
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:24,821
This is why doctors
should have tip jars.

285
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:27,152
I make three bucks
for serving a martini.

286
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:30,866
You put your lips on the mouth of
a dead guy and bring him back to life.

287
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,251
That's gotta be worth
at least a five spot.

288
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:39,839
I should be getting back to James.

289
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:44,147
There's no rush. A nurse is up there
right now getting some blood from him.

290
00:15:44,232 --> 00:15:48,564
I'm sorry! It's never taken me
12 pokes to find a vein.

291
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,109
Got it!

292
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:56,203
I should've brought my laptop.
I could've gotten so much work done.

293
00:15:56,293 --> 00:15:58,168
You can bartend on-line?

294
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:00,129
I work to pay for grad school.

295
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:02,791
I'm getting my master's
in political science.

296
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:05,426
I love politics! Ask me anything.

297
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:09,053
<i>What are you doing?!
You don't know anything about politics!</i>

298
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:12,648
<i>Unless she asks about Bush
or the bald assistant president.</i>

299
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:14,943
Did you know only 17°% of people

300
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:17,654
under the age of 25 voted last year?

301
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,737
You can vote if you're under 25?

302
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,908
<i>The only thing you can take solace in</i>

303
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,206
<i>is a girl like her would probably
never be interested in you.</i>

304
00:16:25,297 --> 00:16:28,550
I can't believe a cute guy
like you doesn't have a girlfriend.

305
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:30,546
If I was single, I'd snatch you up.

306
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,808
Would you like to play
a game of hangman?

307
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:38,188
<i>As I sat there letting
my interns do all my work,</i>

308
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:40,567
<i>I wondered if there
was a parallel universe</i>

309
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:43,112
<i>where another J.D.
And Kylie could be together</i>

310
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:46,572
<i>because there's no Hippocratic oath
on planet Glornack Seven.</i>

311
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:49,336
- Are you on Glornack Seven?
- Why are you so happy?

312
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:52,921
I just did an exchange transfusion
on my malaria patient in there,

313
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:54,967
and he just woke up from his coma.

314
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:59,350
Well, he woke up to a world of bad
boyfriends, oaths, and gonorrhoea.

315
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,895
He did. You know why?

316
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,481
Because I broke the rules and ignored
what Dr Kelso wanted me to do.

317
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,609
<i>Sometimes you have to break the rules.</i>

318
00:17:06,697 --> 00:17:09,404
<i>Elliot's patient waking up
was a clear sign.</i>

319
00:17:09,493 --> 00:17:12,579
Mr Cheng is crashing.

320
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,621
<i>Signs be damned! I'm telling her.</i>

321
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:18,917
Kylie! Kylie!

322
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:24,641
You can't tell her!
They won't let you be a doctor!

323
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,554
I'd make more money bartending!

324
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:31,560
Turk, if we leave right now, I might
be awake for sex tonight. Get my coat.

325
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:36,991
You owe me.

326
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:41,744
Baby, so I didn't know which one
was yours, so I grabbed all of them.

327
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:45,967
Just give me a second. I need to talk
to Elliot, and then I gotta clock out.

328
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:48,425
And then we have sex?
Then we have sex, OK.

329
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,190
I really thought he had a shot.

330
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,316
Well, the family's downstairs
whenever you're ready to talk to them.

331
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:13,251
Go ahead. Call me
sweetheart and tell me

332
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:15,505
I'm a pathetic excuse for a doctor.

333
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,053
You made a bold decision
and it bit you in the keister.

334
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:21,232
Yeah.

335
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:24,569
I don't like people disagreeing with me.

336
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:28,406
There's not another resident here
who has the guts to do it.

337
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:30,287
I feel so guilty about Mr Cheng.

338
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:33,376
Could you at least just make fun
of my bangs or something?

339
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:35,087
Take it from a colleague,

340
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:38,543
Telling that family what happened
after getting their hopes up

341
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:41,093
is going to be far worse
than any shot I can take

342
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:43,639
at that John Denver
haircut you're sporting.

343
00:18:44,604 --> 00:18:47,773
Did... Did you just
call me a colleague?

344
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:51,396
I did. But I hate my colleagues.

345
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:56,203
What the hell are you doing?

346
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:57,749
I get to have sex.

347
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,494
I hate this place.

348
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:03,088
I get to have sex tonight!

349
00:19:04,803 --> 00:19:08,221
- Hey, Kylie, there you are.
- Hey, J.D.

350
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:10,386
<i>This is your moment! Grab it!</i>

351
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:13,766
<i>Listen, Kylie... Out loud,
you idiot! Out loud!</i>

352
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:17,028
I wanted to thank you
for being such a great doctor.

353
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:21,197
<i>And there it was.
Great doctors don't break oaths.</i>

354
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:27,540
Thanks again for everything.

355
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,469
<i>Someone once said
the bad guys always win.</i>

356
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:35,179
<i>Sometimes the bad guy
is a jerk boyfriend.</i>

357
00:19:40,694 --> 00:19:42,771
<i>It's finally here...</i>

358
00:19:42,864 --> 00:19:45,783
<i>the long-awaited showdown
between Shaq and Kobe.</i>

359
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:48,706
<i>Sometimes the bad guy
is the man you've been battling</i>

360
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,451
<i>for as long as you can remember.</i>

361
00:19:50,543 --> 00:19:54,792
<i>Hey, Perry! 98-97 Lakers. Kobe dunked
over Shaq for the game winner.</i>

362
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,179
<i>Don't ever mess with my treadmill.</i>

363
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:07,855
Is this homemade gravy?

364
00:20:11,618 --> 00:20:15,915
<i>And sometimes the bad guy is a disease
that you didn't stand a chance against.</i>

365
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,336
But you said he could get better.

366
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:21,500
I'm so sorry.

367
00:20:21,593 --> 00:20:24,714
<i>I guess all you can do is come back
to work the next morning</i>

368
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,263
<i>and hope that being a good guy pays off.</i>

369
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,391
What are you doing here?

370
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:32,559
My girlfriend Tamyra from the club,

371
00:20:32,652 --> 00:20:36,355
she's also feeling a little sick,
and you'll never guess what she has.

372
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,242
Gonorrhoea!

373
00:20:38,328 --> 00:20:41,496
I mean... gonorrhoea.

374
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:45,666
Kylie, I wanted to tell you so badly,
but, you know, it's against the rules.

375
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:48,342
You can tell me now.

376
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:51,054
Your boyfriend's a jerk.

377
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,217
He's not my boyfriend.

9999
