1
00:00:01,452 --> 00:00:05,388
<i>To make more cash, sacred heart
had started catering to rich folk,</i>

2
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:07,670
<i>Hence the swanky new suites.</i>

3
00:00:07,895 --> 00:00:09,721
Turn down service, mr. worthington?

4
00:00:09,722 --> 00:00:10,769
Oh, not now.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,976
When's a good time?

6
00:00:11,977 --> 00:00:13,839
Never. He's in a coma.

7
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:17,404
<i> Not only were the new suites
super expensive,</i>

8
00:00:17,405 --> 00:00:20,452
<i>they were absolutely ruing my figure.</i>

9
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:26,002
Turk and carla had just
brought their new baby home.

10
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:27,245
What's up, isabella?

11
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:31,947
For your 16th birthday,
your dad has made you a videotape.

12
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:40,147
Now, i know future me is probably
really strict,

13
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:42,200
so no dating, no make-up,

14
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,653
and no spending spring break
with your friends on mars.

15
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:46,689
Last thing i need to worry about
is my daughter

16
00:00:46,778 --> 00:00:48,772
getting eaten by a giant space slug.

17
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,264
Know what i'm sayin'?

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,628
Anyway,

19
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,755
for your 16th birthday,
my gift to you is to show you

20
00:00:54,756 --> 00:00:57,188
how happy your mom was the day we brought you home.

21
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,334
Baby?

22
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,664
I can't do this.

23
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,549
We have to take her back.

24
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:10,894
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

25
00:01:10,895 --> 00:01:12,311
We'll talk later.

26
00:01:12,312 --> 00:01:14,886
<i>As for me, my pregnant girlfriend
just moved away,</i>

27
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:16,863
<i>but I was still keeping things spicy.</i>

28
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,482
Oh, of course I miss you, baby!

29
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:20,201
Want to see a picture of me missing you?

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,875
Hold on.

31
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:25,414
Oh, thanks.

32
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:28,173
Do you want to see a picture
of my rock-hard abs?

33
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:30,464
Ok, hold on.

34
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,235
No, no, I've always had an innie.

35
00:01:39,413 --> 00:01:41,416
She wants to see a picture of my ass.

36
00:01:41,593 --> 00:01:43,933
- Oh, J.D., I don't want...
- I am your superior!

37
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:48,131
what the--?

38
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:51,325
Oh, hey, elliot, I'll have him back to you
in one second.

39
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,044
Kim, yeah, those pictures are of keith, ok?
Read 'em and weep.

40
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:56,808
Look, J.D. will call you back later.

41
00:01:57,345 --> 00:02:00,797
Keith! why do you keep letting people take pictures of your body?

42
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:03,636
I mean, this is exactly like that night
I caught you in the bathroom at the bus station.

43
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:05,380
Come on, this is nothing like that.

44
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:10,532
What the hell are you doing?

45
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:13,705
Oh, hey, elliot. I'll have him back
to you in one second.

46
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:16,523
Gettin' a little flare off the urinal.

47
00:02:17,715 --> 00:02:19,870
Actually, keith, it's a little like that.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,653
Little bit.

49
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:22,653
one areola shot, real quick.

50
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:41,204
<i>Now that elliot was private practice,
there were tons of perks.</i>

51
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:44,010
<i>For one, dr. kelso still refused
to speak to her.</i>

52
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:45,157
Hey, Dr. kelso.

53
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,352
Oh, if you're a doody face,
don't say anything.

54
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:52,334
Get used to that joke, people.

55
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:55,664
Because I'm going to be doing it all the time.

56
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:58,466
Still, the biggest perk is that at 5:00,
she gets

57
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:01,463
to dump  her patients on someone else
and go home.

58
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:04,690
Mr. sandal has hocum. I'm not using
disopyramide,

59
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,482
so just continue treating with beta blockers.

60
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,423
You're giving orders to me?

61
00:03:09,548 --> 00:03:11,051
OMG, barboo,

62
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,613
you make me want to LOL

63
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:16,816
I just discovered text messaging.

64
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,888
I know i'm a little late to the game,

65
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:25,672
but that doesn't mean that you're any less
of a G.A.B.P.I.T.A.W.M.W. number 2 "D."

66
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:30,694
Giant Annoying Bangsy Pain In The Ass
Who Makes me Want to Die.

67
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:33,708
Well, i'm just a little bit late
for my brow wax

68
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,810
and my facial, so

69
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:37,638
I'm just gonna stick these orders
to your lab coat

70
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,888
so you don't forget them.

71
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:41,300
Enjoy doing my bidding, while a team
of burly old russian

72
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:43,186
women make me beautiful.

73
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:46,317
Fine, I don't want to go home, anyway.

74
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:50,185
He said in a sarcastic tone
we've all come to know as "Coxsian."

75
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:51,853
I mean it.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,205
I don't want to go home. Ever since jordan

77
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:57,076
entered her third trimester,
she has become a needy, bloated behemoth

78
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:59,963
with a temper as big as her tree trunk-size cankles,

79
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:02,678
and besides, even if I did go home,
she'd probably just send me out on a food run

80
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:05,023
To satiate one of her insane cravings.

81
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:10,699
Honey, I brought you some dinner.

82
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:13,341
Come here, little goaty goaty!

83
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:23,403
- I wasn't finished!
- You're finished.

84
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,420
Honey, post partum depression's really serious.

85
00:04:30,421 --> 00:04:32,887
True, but there are different levels.

86
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:35,772
Yes, some women leave their babies
in the woods,

87
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:37,925
but some women just get the weepies.

88
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,844
- And it's just the weepies?
- Just the weepies baby.

89
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:46,131
Hi! Since you're african american,

90
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:49,104
I was wondering if I can borrow
some of your marvin gaye cds?

91
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,117
Sure. Come on in, kid.

92
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:53,429
Here you go.

93
00:04:53,864 --> 00:04:57,622
Thanks! Mazel tov on the baby.

94
00:04:57,837 --> 00:04:59,965
How did he know I had a baby?

95
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:07,631
oh! great!

96
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:11,075
I milked through my last clean t-shirt!

97
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,161
Baby, we should really get some help.

98
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,632
No! I've been a nurse for 15 years!

99
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:19,532
What are they gonna tell us that we don't
already know?

100
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:24,204
- Now, now, who are we?
- We're the turks.

101
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:27,405
- And can the turks can get through this?
- Woman, the turks can handle anything.

102
00:05:27,406 --> 00:05:29,075
- Ok!
- Ok, now give me a hug!

103
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,749
- Ok!
- Wait, you know what? Could you change first?

104
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:34,722
'cause I don't want to get any booby juice
on my new t-shirt.

105
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:43,217
<i>To me, the best thing about elliot
is all her extra cash.</i>

106
00:05:43,306 --> 00:05:45,152
Hey, roomie! I went shopping.

107
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:48,317
Oh, this couch reminded me of my grandpa.

108
00:05:48,318 --> 00:05:51,031
He used to drive around in a car just like it.

109
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:53,979
You know, until he was killed in that 7-car pile-up.

110
00:05:54,316 --> 00:05:56,941
"7- car pile-up" would be a good name
for a rock band.

111
00:05:57,294 --> 00:06:00,793
Yeah, you actually told me that
on the day that he died.

112
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:05,019
Anywho, I was thinking maybe we should put in
some new hardwood floors.

113
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:06,886
Why stop at hardwood?

114
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:11,155
Yay, the new floors are in!

115
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:20,000
Careful. trampoline floors take some gettin' used to.

116
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:23,462
But I love 'em.

117
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:27,265
I like bouncing, but it is dangerous.

118
00:06:27,564 --> 00:06:29,768
I don't care if you don't like green.

119
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,044
Jello is jello.

120
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:35,156
Laverne, if I accidentally
backed my car over barbie,

121
00:06:35,157 --> 00:06:38,432
for sticking me with the world
most annoying patient,

122
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:41,493
What do you think your boy jesus would do?

123
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:42,867
Your wife is on the phone.

124
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:45,099
He is not a merciful god, is he?

125
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:47,013
Just tell her I'm still working,

126
00:06:47,163 --> 00:06:49,002
I have no idea what time I'm going to get off,

127
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:51,013
And just go ahead and eat the entire mattress.

128
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:53,000
I mean, for the love of god!

129
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:57,326
I spend the entire day with patient
and the entire night with her.

130
00:06:57,388 --> 00:06:58,774
I need a hide-out.

131
00:06:59,322 --> 00:07:00,038
You're telling me.

132
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:01,308
I've got this new land lady,

133
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:03,104
oozy old broad,
keeps showing up at my door

134
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:05,246
in an open robe and a bottle of gin.

135
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:06,717
I don't want to go home.

136
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:09,300
Can you tell Dr. kelso that Mr.worthington's family

137
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:11,833
transferred him from the luxury suite
to a hospice, please?

138
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,023
oh! my god, this is beautiful.

139
00:07:18,224 --> 00:07:21,583
Gentlemen, how is Mr. worthington doing?

140
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,220
He, uh, he's in a coma, bob.

141
00:07:24,663 --> 00:07:28,264
Great! the man has the health insurance
of a tahitian prince.

142
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,276
Well, I gotta tell you, this is heaven.

143
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:42,649
This gourmet trail mix is fantastic.

144
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,297
I'm tastin' vanilla, cranberry...a hint of pine.

145
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:49,192
That's potpourri, genius.

146
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:51,568
Is that hickory?

147
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,281
You should see all
the sweet new toys elliot bought.

148
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:56,339
It's awesome.

149
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:59,532
It's like that time in college
when we got to split all of chugski's stuff

150
00:07:59,635 --> 00:08:01,160
when he drank himself to death.

151
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:03,454
I miss you, you crazy polish bastard!

152
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:05,557
Pour some out for one's homies.

153
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,704
So, how are things at the homestead?

154
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:12,587
Ah, no worries.

155
00:08:13,356 --> 00:08:17,035
I can't feed my own baby!

156
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:21,457
See, baby, the great thing
about workg at a hospital

157
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,536
is that we have access
to all types of medical care.

158
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:26,338
Having trouble feeding your baby?

159
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:29,182
Bam, say hello to your lactation specialists.

160
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,621
Try tickling her lip with the nipple

161
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,334
to let her know it's time to eat.

162
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:35,813
Then just use your breast
to lower her bottom lip.

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,202
I can't see the nipple.

164
00:08:37,937 --> 00:08:39,595
Todd, get the hell out of here.

165
00:08:46,517 --> 00:08:47,778
It's freezing in here.

166
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:49,552
Put on a pair of pants,
you'd be fine.

167
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:52,465
Hey, in my house,
it's no pants, no problem.

168
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:54,086
I'm putting in a videotape.

169
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:59,252
Now, what the hell is this?

170
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:00,568
It's a security camera tape.

171
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:02,111
I like to count the times

172
00:09:02,186 --> 00:09:04,281
that colonel doctor goes to the bathroom
during the day,

173
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:06,626
then freak him out
by guessing the exact number.

174
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:08,253
And there's one...

175
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,199
- Hey!
- Look, this--this

176
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,990
clearly isn't working out.

177
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:13,897
Well, I found this room,

178
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:15,211
so you should go.

179
00:09:17,277 --> 00:09:19,732
Now, that's just about enough, shrek.

180
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:23,719
What?

181
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:27,044
I specifically told you
not to give mr. sandal disopyramide.

182
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:28,772
Why would you change my orders?

183
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:30,533
Well, there were 2 treatment options,

184
00:09:30,597 --> 00:09:33,699
and when in doubt, I always go
in the opposite direction of you.

185
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:38,046
- Don't do it again.
- So, do it again?

186
00:09:39,393 --> 00:09:40,550
Look, barbie,

187
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,874
What you're missing here
is that you're private practice now.

188
00:09:43,964 --> 00:09:46,359
That means you're the enemy.
and I know, as a doctor,

189
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,949
disease is supposed to be the enemy,

190
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:51,040
but I'm giving hepatitis and his bantam

191
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,984
infectious buddies a pass,
and I'm coming after you today.

192
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:56,744
The bottom line is you'd rather
clock out of here early

193
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:58,360
than run the extra mile
for your patients, and, barbie,

194
00:09:58,361 --> 00:10:00,661
that makes you a sell-out.

195
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:09,381
Ah, you went 14 times total--
4 false alarms and one emergency.

196
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,458
Uncanny.

197
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:13,819
I'm exhausted.

198
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:15,946
Pick me up a latte.

199
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:20,599
She's still not eating.
None of this stuff is working.

200
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,699
We're the turks, remember?
Now, if you ask me,

201
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,227
isabella is placing calls,
but no one's responding in the areola code.

202
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:29,155
What?

203
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:31,146
Those 2 little turkey timers
you got there

204
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:33,000
are telling me
that that birdie's not done.

205
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:37,059
And this place is too public
for me to arouse them freaky-deeky style-y,

206
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,354
So, i'm gonna have to go
an alternate route.

207
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:45,063
your dead mama had one of the
fattest asses I've ever seen!

208
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:45,752
what?!

209
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,514
Turkey's done.

210
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,493
She's latching.

211
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:54,465
Dr. cox is such a jerk.

212
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:57,667
I'm so sick of hearing him get all righteous
about private practice doctors.

213
00:10:57,668 --> 00:11:01,392
We're the turks! what, We're the turks!
We're the turks, what?! We're the turks!

214
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:03,324
- We're the turks, what?!
- You're the turks!

215
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:06,200
That's right, we're the turks!

216
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:06,881
I mean, seriously,

217
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:09,621
since when does working at a hospital
suddenly make you a better person?

218
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:11,025
It's such a load of crap.

219
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:12,600
I don't know if it's really a load of crap.

220
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:14,140
it's just that,  well, if you--

221
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,998
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
could you say that a little bit louder?

222
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:19,694
I just thought, you know, money,
like a sell-out, so--

223
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:22,161
Wait, do you actually
agree with dr. cox?

224
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:25,420
<i>It doesn't take too much
to send 2 people down a bad road.</i>

225
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:27,718
<i>it could be a few simple words...</i>

226
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,007
I guess I do.

227
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:32,455
<i>or even just a little surprise waiting at home.</i>

228
00:11:33,455 --> 00:11:37,066
We're the turks, what?! we're the turks!
we're the turks, what--

229
00:11:38,926 --> 00:11:41,251
Why are you watching my baby,
and where's my wife?

230
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:43,331
She said she'd be back later.

231
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:52,222
J.D., have you seen carla?

232
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:55,377
- Sorry, brown bear.
Hey, mocha cup.

233
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:57,499
Carla just called

234
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,444
to tell you nothing fit,
so she went to the mall.

235
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:00,630
Watch her.

236
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:04,931
ooh, hey, chuckles! If you're a doody face,
just keep walking.

237
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:08,157
Get funnier every time, people.

238
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,297
- Hey, J.D.
- Hey, elliot,

239
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:12,672
look, I know you're probably mad
about what I said yesterday, and--

240
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:15,599
I'm not mad. Well,
I mean, at first I was a little mad

241
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,488
so I started power walking
down fourth avenue.

242
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:20,620
Right when I got to that place
where it starts to get a little ghetto,

243
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:22,687
I realized, you're just jealous.

244
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,094
I am not jealous.

245
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:26,821
oh, please, J.D., I know you.
Whenever you're jealous,

246
00:12:26,822 --> 00:12:29,405
you run your hands through your hair
and then you smell them.

247
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,264
I do not!

248
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,600
<i>Ok, resist smelling</i>

249
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,941
<i>That coconut goodness
that caresses your tresses!</i>

250
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:37,153
<i>Don't do it!</i>

251
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:38,714
Whatever.

252
00:12:43,665 --> 00:12:45,081
Ahh, pina colada!

253
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,022
I think these would
go great with that shirt.

254
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:51,212
Why don't you go try them on?

255
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:54,231
Why were you just helping that guy?

256
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,000
These pants and the shirt are the only things
I have left that fit me,

257
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:59,143
and everyone keeps
mistaking me for an employee.

258
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:02,127
Anyway, I was helping phil
with his whole new denim look.

259
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:04,538
- Hey, could you also get me--
- Go away, phil.

260
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:06,262
Baby, let's go see the doctor.

261
00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:07,273
No,

262
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:09,279
I'm not gonna have people laugh at me

263
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,796
because I can't care for my own child.

264
00:13:10,797 --> 00:13:14,099
No doctors, not now, not ever.
Understand?

265
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,849
We're the turks!

266
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,086
Put that down.

267
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:25,657
Elliot said that until
you admit you're jealous,

268
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:27,084
You can't use any of her things.

269
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:29,985
Well, elliot's not here, keith.
what are you gonna do about it?

270
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:34,316
Nice singlet.
Does it come in hetero?

271
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,135
Do not turn on that tv.

272
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,266
He wrestled you, didn't he?

273
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:53,508
See, keith got his old high school uniform

274
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:55,749
so that he actually incorporated it
into our love play.

275
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,582
I'm the lesbian coach
and he's the captain of the wrestling team,

276
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,026
and he turns me--

277
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,769
So, have you decided to admit
that you're jealous?

278
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,182
No, never, ok? And thanks a lot,

279
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:08,394
because the one hour that kim and I had
to actually talk,

280
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:10,608
I was stuckin your stupid
boyfriend's scissor-hold.

281
00:14:11,462 --> 00:14:14,586
Oh, don't you just love the way his thighs
feel against your ears?

282
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,192
No, not particularly.

283
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:26,109
- Dr. cox, I need your help.
- Not now, ghandi.

284
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,098
darn it all, I-- I could have sworn
there was a room right here--

285
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:34,311
Do you hear something?

286
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:49,066
Look, carla's going all post partum
depression-y on me,

287
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,990
And she won't let me to take her to see a doctor.

288
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,317
She's never gonna listen to you.

289
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:54,357
You're a guy.

290
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:56,582
You have no idea what she's going through.

291
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,806
The fact is, the only person
she will listen to

292
00:14:58,807 --> 00:15:01,032
is someone who's gone
through it themselves.

293
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:02,865
Fine. who?

294
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,580
I cannot believe I am doing this.

295
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:28,817
- I'm scared.
- Me, too, ghandi.

296
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:35,318
What!?

297
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,322
- You look pretty, dear.
- So pretty.

298
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:43,808
Keikers?

299
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:46,633
Nuts.

300
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:51,473
Hi, J.D.

301
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,493
Relax, I'm at the hospital.
This is just a webcam.

302
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,063
What's the matter? Your aryan boyfriend
had to go to a rally,

303
00:15:58,064 --> 00:15:59,481
so now you have to watch me?

304
00:15:59,482 --> 00:16:01,762
Look, you don't have
to admit that you're jealous.

305
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:03,016
I was thinking,

306
00:16:03,017 --> 00:16:06,082
Kim's not around, and I can't even imagine
how much that sucks,

307
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,467
so, I sent her a webcam just like this one,

308
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,153
and you guys can video chat whenever you want.

309
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:12,101
Anything to make the long distance easier, right?

310
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:15,388
Anyway, I hope you like it.
See you.

311
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,112
I love the interhighway.

312
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,671
I've been expecting you.

313
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:48,422
You know, jumpsuit,

314
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:51,713
As I was scaling the hospital,
I had an epiphany.

315
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:54,654
This back-and-forth between you and I

316
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:56,573
is just gonna get worse and worse.

317
00:16:56,574 --> 00:16:59,390
I mean, the only thing
I could think about was retaliation,

318
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,888
And I'm relatively certain that you've got a
couple of tricks up your sleeve, too.

319
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:06,311
I do have a friend.
He works on wall street.

320
00:17:06,312 --> 00:17:08,482
He and I got a good look
at your personal finances,

321
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:11,047
and he agreed to fly into town
and bash your head in.

322
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:14,689
Right. that would roughly be
what I'm referring to.

323
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:19,108
- Ahh. then, yes.
- There really is only one way to end this.

324
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,890
We each ingest a cyanide capsule.
On 3--

325
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:23,677
One, 2, 3.

326
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:26,449
- No. What are you doing?
- Mine's a skittle.

327
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:28,351
- Mine, too?
- Sure.

328
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:30,369
Get out of here.

329
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:35,098
Look, there really is only one way to end this
so that we both come out alive.

330
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:37,475
We've got to page him.

331
00:17:57,115 --> 00:17:58,124
You.

332
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,908
Get the hell out of here
before I charge you

333
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:03,447
for every cashew you've pilfred
from the mini-bar.

334
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:05,034
And you,

335
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:08,782
Stop eating the potpourri
and get back to work.

336
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:17,743
- So you have post-partum depression.
- No. I have the weepies.

337
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:20,101
- No, baby,you've got post--
- You have no lines in this play.

338
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:23,775
Jordan, I can handle it.

339
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:25,444
Really? What you got there
in your hand?

340
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,167
A job application for the gap.

341
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:30,891
Oh, that's a good career move.

342
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:32,087
Look...

343
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:37,064
All I ever wanted was to be a mother,

344
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:41,115
And now that I am one,
I feel like I'm not cut out for it.

345
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:42,318
And you're ashamed of that?

346
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,648
Well, wouldn't you be?

347
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:46,860
Yeah. I was.

348
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:50,610
What's the worst feeling
you've had since you had the baby?

349
00:18:51,883 --> 00:18:52,829
I don't know.

350
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,273
When jack wouldn't stop crying,

351
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:55,835
I wanted to throw that bastard
out the window.

352
00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:57,293
Really?

353
00:18:57,976 --> 00:19:00,730
I wanted to throw isabella
out the window.

354
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,961
But we just had our apartment repainted,

355
00:19:03,962 --> 00:19:06,002
and all the windows were sealed shut,

356
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:09,201
so I just wanted to drop her off the roof.

357
00:19:09,202 --> 00:19:11,629
- Oh, my god!
- Listen,

358
00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:13,414
you can't get rid this

359
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:16,009
by sheer force of will or positive thinking

360
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,307
or taking advice from a big hollywood movie star
and the dead science fiction writer he worships.

361
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:24,619
You need to get some help.

362
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:29,152
That's what I've been try--

363
00:19:29,153 --> 00:19:31,552
If you talk again,
I'm going to eat you.

364
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Hey, everybody.

365
00:19:39,397 --> 00:19:40,518
You hear her, newbie.

366
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:43,347
Private practice barbie is clocking out.

367
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,093
Now, if we could just get cancer
to go home at 5:00, we'd be all set.

368
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:47,802
Come on. You're just jealous.

369
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:50,654
I know I am.

370
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,053
<i>The first step of solving any problem
is admitting that you have one.</i>

371
00:19:55,243 --> 00:19:59,156
<i>After that, you can start to work
on feeling like your old self again.</i>

372
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:03,088
All right, izzie. this is what
your mom looks like on anti-depressants.

373
00:20:03,857 --> 00:20:06,237
- Oh, we're sharing secrets now?
- Yeah.

374
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,088
Oh, 'cause izzie, look,

375
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:09,388
this is what your daddy looks like

376
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:11,163
the last time he tried to grow out his hair.

377
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:12,684
How sad.

378
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,217
That's cold, baby.

379
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,040
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

380
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:31,772
That is so not why I bought you that.

381
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:35,099
Elliot, relax.
We heard you coming.

382
00:20:35,774 --> 00:20:39,266
Whatever. Kim, your boobies look great up there.

383
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:44,646
- I didn't hear her coming.
- Me neither.

384
00:20:44,987 --> 00:20:46,438
All right, now get back in there, stud.

385
00:20:47,005 --> 00:20:48,242
In a sec.

386
00:20:49,401 --> 00:20:51,033
I really miss you.

387
00:20:53,443 --> 00:20:55,192
Yeah, I miss you too.
