1
00:00:02,282 --> 00:00:03,682
<i>It was a day of discovery.</i>

2
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:05,812
<i>I discovered that I could sex</i>

3
00:00:05,934 --> 00:00:07,694
<i>my pregnant girlfriend into a coma.</i>

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,200
<i>Nice!</i>

5
00:00:10,283 --> 00:00:13,732
<i>Carla discovered that her baby wasn't
the only one who loved breast feeding.</i>

6
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:16,359
Ohhh, are you hungry, sweetie?

7
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:17,840
I could eat.

8
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:24,458
<i>Dr. Kelso discovered change was not always welcome.</i>

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,801
A coffee place in a hospital?

10
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:30,605
What's next, Bob, an ice cream parlor in the morgue?

11
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,200
Admittedly not a horrible idea, seeing as
the freezers are already down there,

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,100
plus it'll be a perfect place for kids

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,533
one of our famous vanilla malteds
definitely takes the sting out of

14
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:42,817
having to identify the freshly charred
remains of your father!

15
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,800
Nobody else seems to mind.

16
00:00:48,446 --> 00:00:49,764
I should'a worn sunblock.

17
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:55,263
Did you get tickets yet?

18
00:00:58,686 --> 00:00:59,445
Ah! Another one!

19
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:13,514
Now I'm at the end of both lines.

20
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,800
<i>Still, the best discovery
was learning that</i>

21
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:18,875
<i>someone I drummed out of
medicine had landed on his feet.</i>

22
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:20,853
Frontsies!
CABBAGE!

23
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,496
Hey, Dr. D.

24
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:26,574
That's what we call "Cabbage-tastic."

25
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:29,191
Oh, I love this job -- I screw up, nobody gets hurt.

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,500
Except Cindy.

27
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:34,912
I scalded her pretty bad with some steamed milk,
you could see the bone.

28
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,473
Eww. How about a second of that dynamite ape impression.

29
00:01:44,762 --> 00:01:47,744
I'm sorry, Cindy, once he's in monkey mode, you can't stop him.

30
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:50,087
But who would want to, right? Cheers.

31
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,904
Hey, Kim! Just checkin' to see if your socks are back on,
since I knocked 'em off last night!

32
00:01:57,026 --> 00:01:58,060
Helloooooo!

33
00:01:58,456 --> 00:01:59,795
What am I doing?

34
00:01:59,947 --> 00:02:01,986
You're the mother of my child. That is so tacky.

35
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:06,307
And so is this: Way to hit that, player!

36
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:09,320
So sorry.

37
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:11,663
Relax, it's just sex. We should be able to talk about it.

38
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:14,798
I'm not telling Isabella she's got a vagina till she turns eighteen.

39
00:02:15,257 --> 00:02:16,900
That's gonna be an awkward birthday party.

40
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:19,730
Do not tell my daughter she has a vagina! I'm serious!

41
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:22,104
It may have already come up.

42
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:25,664
Kim, uh, J.D. tells us that you're looking around town for a new job?

43
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:29,042
Yeah, I just don't think the department head here is ever gonna promote me.

44
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:29,513
Why?

45
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,256
Dr. Lemke! You're gonna love this.

46
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,786
We're a husband and wife piano playing team,
only I have no hands!

47
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:48,286
- With my head!
- How great is that!

48
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:50,477
This is my wife, Sally.

49
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:53,033
She lost her thumbs last month when

50
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:55,711
our pet Komodo dragon, Morty, got out of his cage.

51
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:01,402
On the bright side, you have beautiful nubs.

52
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:07,458
A tip jar. Really? So what am I supposed to do,

53
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,227
just duke you my change because you poured
hot water through beans?

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,718
Well, I'll tell you what, my friend,

55
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:15,864
unless you're also planning on giving me
a complimentary reach-around with my beverage,

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,407
I'm afraid the answer is yeah...no!

57
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,324
Here's a--here's a novel idea:

58
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:22,850
Why don't you go fetch me a very large cup of coffee

59
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:26,053
with so damn many fake sugars in it, that the coffee itself gets cancer.

60
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:29,697
Guys, guys, I got a good one.

61
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:31,292
Is it me, or does--

62
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:34,482
"...someone need to switch to decaf?"

63
00:03:35,668 --> 00:03:38,794
Lay off of Elliot. She doesn't watch as much old TV as we do.

64
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:43,008
You actually stood up for me! But, now I'm forced to ask--

65
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:45,769
"...who are you? And what have you done with Turk?"

66
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:48,617
STOP FINISHING MY AWESOME JOKES!
- Oh, my God!

67
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:10,800
She's so beautiful. Can I hold her?

68
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:14,175
That's up to Turk. He's kinda paranoid about people dropping her.

69
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,198
Yeah, you got decent hands. Go ahead.

70
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:23,038
I get her first because we're best friends.

71
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,479
Elliot. Ted, give it!

72
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,100
Ooh, I'm next.

73
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:31,334
What?

74
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:32,628
You drop everything.

75
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:33,963
When do I--

76
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:36,340
Besides now.

77
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:38,733
Look, come on, it is a human life -- I'll focus.

78
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,876
Give it to me! Right here!

79
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:45,241
Wait! One moresie!

80
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:49,193
So, Carla, how much time do you think you'll take off?

81
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:52,179
Ohhh, look at this little angel.

82
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,667
I may never go back to work.

83
00:04:58,347 --> 00:04:59,330
I heard suckling.

84
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:06,161
So, you're having chest pains, Mr. Turner.

85
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:08,055
Actually, it's Dr. Turner.

86
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:10,797
You look like someone I used to date.

87
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:13,086
I had a brief older guy jones, but now

88
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,917
I'm with someone more
age-appropriate...and I'm like,

89
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:16,390
Eww, what was I thinking?

90
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,189
Mm. We are disgusting.

91
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,046
Yeah, but for some reason I was curious.

92
00:05:21,174 --> 00:05:23,599
Anyhoo, uh, we'll just run the usual tests.

93
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:24,614
Sounds good.

94
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:29,520
Dr. Turner seems like a nice guy. And he's hot

95
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,293
you know, like if...you left Brad Pitt out in the sun forever....

96
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:36,414
Stop it, Elliot! It took you months to get over that old man fetish!

97
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:38,997
Blondie! He is private practice.

98
00:05:39,582 --> 00:05:40,964
Those guys are cocky jackasses

99
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:43,660
who don't give two shakes about
anybody else's opinion but their own.

100
00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:45,635
They're...they're me,

101
00:05:45,882 --> 00:05:47,691
with one addendum: They're whores.

102
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:50,581
And I'm not talking about the good kind of whores like my ex-wife.

103
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:52,415
They're whores for money.

104
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,187
Is that a tip jar?

105
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:55,788
Look...

106
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,026
I'm figurin' if those lumps down at the coffee shop
can have one, I can, too.

107
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:03,553
Listen to me. You may like Turner right now,
but he is a doctor,

108
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:05,121
and doctors make terrible patients --

109
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:06,896
sooner or later, they all try to treat themselves.

110
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:09,818
Perry, a quick word--

111
00:06:09,913 --> 00:06:11,456
Bobbo! No time!

112
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,623
Gotta go tell Mr. Clancy that his tumor is benign.

113
00:06:13,696 --> 00:06:14,775
Is that not exciting?

114
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:16,758
Should be worth a finski -- whatta ya think?

115
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:21,530
Where the hell did you all come from?

116
00:06:21,793 --> 00:06:24,507
Sneak attack. You can put your shoes on again,
guys. Nice work.

117
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:27,570
Dr. Kelso, as spokesman for the support staff of this hospital,

118
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,627
I have a request.

119
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:32,228
I do not want to hear any more about a college scholarship fund.

120
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,837
Stop filling your children's heads with nonsense!

121
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,659
Pull them out of high school and teach them
a trade like plumbing or undertaking!

122
00:06:38,892 --> 00:06:41,714
None of us here even have kids, except for Margo,
and she sold hers.

123
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:43,408
We want a dental plan.

124
00:06:43,742 --> 00:06:44,879
Dental is for old people.

125
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,857
You young bucks have years before you have
to worry about your choppers.

126
00:06:49,263 --> 00:06:51,006
One, two...

127
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,492
Lovely. No.

128
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,573
Rudy? Did you tear an actual tooth outta your head?

129
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:05,558
We were all fakin' it, man! What are you--

130
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,158
Okay, don't worry. You know what?
I got a jar of monkey teeth in my workbench...

131
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:11,259
what's that, molar? We're gonna be all right.

132
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:17,069
Man, we got smoked.

133
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:19,763
That's what we get for playing a bunch of Gs from the 'hood.

134
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:21,723
Those guys are Indian.

135
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:27,058
So "Rajesh" isn't one of those cool black
homely names like "Anforny"?

136
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:29,409
No, "Rajesh" is like "Steve" in India.

137
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,058
Why are we stopping?

138
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:37,384
You always buy me a cotton candy after the game
to celebrate my good sportsmanship.

139
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:39,752
Yeah, well, you know what?
I can't be buying you stuff all the time!

140
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:41,767
Yeah, well, I'm very close to a tantrum.

141
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:43,982
Could you guys look at my shoulder?

142
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,928
I tweaked it pretty good.

143
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,109
Come on, Vijay, first you dunk on me and yell,
"Who's your bitch!"

144
00:07:48,174 --> 00:07:49,710
now you want free medical advice?

145
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:51,517
How did I not know these guys were Indian?

146
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:52,990
I'll give you twenty bucks.

147
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,277
I'm sorry, my friend, but that's just not ethical.

148
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:57,156
Done and done!

149
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:02,475
Uh, heh, who's the new guy?

150
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:07,555
Oh, this is Dr. Kershnar from my practice.
Elliot Reid, I was telling you about. Give her a wave.

151
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:13,062
Look, as a doctor, I know that you're gonna be
tempted to wanna treat yourself,

152
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:15,650
and I just want you to know that's not gonna fly with me.

153
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:16,932
Understood.

154
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:18,069
Great.

155
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:19,843
Now, I believe that surgery on your

156
00:08:19,844 --> 00:08:21,477
abdominal aortic aneurysm's
gonna be too aggressive

157
00:08:21,537 --> 00:08:23,529
I'd like to start you on twenty-five grams of Lopressor.

158
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:25,513
Don't you mean twenty-five milligrams?

159
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,490
There! See? You're already trying to treat yourself!

160
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:29,280
That was a test.

161
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:31,655
But twenty-five grams would kill me.

162
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:34,721
I know. But i-i-it's still a test.

163
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:39,529
Fine. From now on, you're the doctor.

164
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:46,102
All right, relax, you're fine. Just ice it when you get home.

165
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:52,586
Put that away, Turk! That's back-alley money!

166
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:53,459
Relax!

167
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:56,873
Hey. I'll give you twenty bucks if you check out my rash.

168
00:08:57,497 --> 00:09:00,842
'm sorry, cotton candy man, but unlike my friend,

169
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:02,747
here, I have no interest in being sued for...

170
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:04,578
Do I smell blue?

171
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:06,058
just added the dye.

172
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:11,249
Ohhhhh! You crafty, crafty man -- that is fluffing up nicely.

173
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:14,579
Hey, give me some money, I'm jonesing for some c-squared.

174
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:17,482
Oh, you don't want my back-alley money, do you?

175
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:19,041
You heartless bastard.

176
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,498
All right, let's see your disgusting rash.

177
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:27,810
It's probably just eczema.
One blue, please!

178
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:36,999
I'd like to see the blueberry again.

179
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,614
Blueberries taste fresh.

180
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:47,353
Hint of lemon zest...I'm intrigued.

181
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,375
And unfortunately processed flour. No thank you.

182
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:54,247
Let me try your carrot.

183
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:02,374
I've a non-fat latte with room for Schnapps for Janitor?

184
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:04,512
Yep, thank you.

185
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:06,977
Nice braces.

186
00:10:08,522 --> 00:10:12,488
- You're not worried about, uh, spider monkeys?
- Spider monkeys?

187
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:16,841
Spider monkeys see intricate metal work
as a display of dominance.

188
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,226
It's a threat to them -- they'd tear your eyes out.

189
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:21,809
Well, I'm just psyched this place is paying for 'em.

190
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:23,289
You get dental?

191
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:31,009
So, uh, Dr. Turner said that I am a very talented young physician.

192
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:35,898
Jordan said I'm the only man she ever wants to have sex with!

193
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:39,210
Aren't we sharing fantastic lies

194
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:40,881
we choose to believe for personal reasons?

195
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:43,242
He's actually a very deferential patient.

196
00:10:43,306 --> 00:10:45,914
Instead of surgery, I'm treating his AAA with drugs.

197
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,032
Dr. Chatterbox there scheduled him for...surgery.

198
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:52,689
What the hell, Kersh!

199
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:57,679
I don't care if we had extra coffee money left over...

200
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,559
I don't feel right taking that guy's cash.

201
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,295
Dude, stop stressing. See you later.

202
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:07,648
Is anybody planning on emptying that?

203
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:13,441
<i>Sometimes everything you need to know is on the side of a coffee cup.
</i>

204
00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:16,856
<i>Never underestimate those around you...</i>

205
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:19,546
<i>or they may betray you...</i>

206
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,016
Greetings, customer! What can I get you?

207
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:26,930
<i>...they may deceive you...</i>

208
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:29,027
And here we are.

209
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,080
Even though Kershnar's signature is on the chart,

210
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,561
this is the gentleman who ordered the surgery.

211
00:11:35,248 --> 00:11:36,983
No, he didn't. Tell him.

212
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,441
What would you like me to say?

213
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:43,520
I'm just gonna go ahead and tip myself for calling this one!

214
00:11:44,347 --> 00:11:45,442
Thank you,

215
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:47,722
me!

216
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:52,290
<i>in the end, those same people
will make you wish you'd never met them.</i>

217
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:56,697
<i>Maybe that wasn't just a rash on cotton candy man.</i>

218
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:06,723
<i>I didn't tell Kim about how I most likely ruined my career</i>

219
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:08,954
<i> by misdiagnosing the cotton candy man.</i>

220
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:11,731
<i> I don't like to be a burden to the people I care about.</i>

221
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:14,838
Turk. I need you, and I need you now.

222
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:18,999
Isabella, this is the man you'll be competing with
for your father's love.

223
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:21,376
Goochie-goochie-goo. Turk. Now.

224
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:24,375
Babe, he's using his emergency tone.

225
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:26,415
Go ahead. I have to feed her anyway.

226
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:32,383
Ugh, my breasts are so sore.
I wish I could just give you formula.

227
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:35,079
Formula's bad for the baby.

228
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:37,765
Boob milk's healthier!

229
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,716
His rash is probably purpura from
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy,

230
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:44,091
and I missed it, Turk. I'm screwed!

231
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:47,307
Okay, you...you go in there and take care of things.

232
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:52,310
I'll...I'll just stand out here and think about
all the things I'll miss about being a doctor.

233
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:55,215
The light cotton outfits...

234
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:57,790
the free gauze....

235
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:02,798
He's gone.

236
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,934
Somebody shot him.

237
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:10,292
I hope it wasn't the corn-dog guy.

238
00:13:10,348 --> 00:13:11,389
They never got along.

239
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:18,034
Look, Dr. Turner, you're older, you're not in the best health.

240
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:19,628
I really think that this surgery could kill you.

241
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,618
Are they gonna come in and shave me soon?

242
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:24,731
I'm still your primary physician.

243
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:26,953
No, Kershnar's my lead now.

244
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,322
I think surgery is the right choice.

245
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:33,106
Did you give him cue cards?

246
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,939
That way he gets it exactly right.

247
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:43,881
You don't scare me. Eventually, you will all come crawling back.

248
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,054
Now, how about somebody gets me a
banana-nut muffin, and hold the spit, please.

249
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:52,294
As manager, I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.

250
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,743
Manager? You have worked here one day.

251
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:57,322
Corporate loved my ingenuity.

252
00:13:57,846 --> 00:14:00,298
I was saying, the two most addictive substances on earth

253
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:05,334
are caffeine and...nicotine! Behold.

254
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:12,421
Smokachino! For Kyle.

255
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:14,582
Kyle! Smokachino for Kyle!

256
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,575
Enjoy that.

257
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,480
That's as tall as he's gonna get.

258
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:23,374
I feel like I dodged a bullet.

259
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,729
Trust me, Brown Bear, you don't want this
hanging over your head.

260
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:27,803
Find Vijay and give him his twenty bucks back.

261
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:29,859
Yeah, but then I'd have to give the money back to all the others.

262
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:33,228
I kinda did a few diagnoses at the mall yesterday.

263
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:35,448
Are you crazy? You could get sued!

264
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:37,732
Secondly, I can't believe you went to the mall without me...

265
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,698
I specifically told you I needed to buy loafers.

266
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:43,049
And thirdly, how could you go to the mall without me?
That's our thing!

267
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:45,835
Well, I don't see you giving the money back
to cotton candy man!

268
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,699
As a matter of fact, I already did.

269
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:53,367
A twenty! Score!

270
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,444
...Cool shirt...!

271
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:00,684
All right, I earned that money, and I'm not giving it back,

272
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,508
and there's nothing you can do to make me.

273
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,124
Give those people their money back!

274
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:09,863
- I can't believe you told!
- Turk, we're doctors. We live by a moral code.

275
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,870
Aloha! I came to see the little kahuna!

276
00:15:16,823 --> 00:15:20,600
- Giant coffee.
- Saw you coming. Here's your vente drip.

277
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,776
How 'bout a Corinne Bailey Ray CD.

278
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:25,898
With her stripped-down sound and chilled-out vibe,

279
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
this British soul superstar is one of the year's hottest newcomers.

280
00:15:31,074 --> 00:15:32,852
You know what...I'll take one of those.

281
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:35,698
It's a sale.

282
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,595
You know the worst thing about Turner's surgery?

283
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:43,584
I'm gonna be right, but...he's gonna die.
It'll be a hollow victory.

284
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:47,138
If I got to be right and have a private practice doctor

285
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:51,926
die due to his own idiocy,
I would call that a pretty full victory.

286
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:56,190
Banana-nut muffin, please.

287
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:58,334
Sir, I've been told not to serve you.

288
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,034
Hey, just take me.

289
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:07,574
What are they gonna do, put you in jail?

290
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:09,467
You're Bob Kelso!

291
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:11,556
Just grab me and run!

292
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:13,437
Do it!

293
00:16:23,594 --> 00:16:26,401
All right, I'm going on break.
Don't touch the muffin puppet.

294
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:33,783
Let's see if you're qualified to hold your own baby.

295
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:40,478
I caught it! That counts!

296
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,711
I'm gonna go hold the crap outta that baby!

297
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:47,515
J.D., what the hell!

298
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:49,084
I'm a surgeon...that coulda hit my hand!

299
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,013
Why are you being so weird lately?

300
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,845
You won't loan me money for cotton candy,
you're charging strangers for medical advice,

301
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:56,341
and now you're worried about your hand?

302
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:57,476
Who are you?

303
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:59,749
...and what did you do with Turk?

304
00:17:00,091 --> 00:17:02,384
Great work, everybody! Thank you!

305
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,082
I asked them to help me out for emphasis.

306
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:06,522
Seriously, what's going on?

307
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:08,225
You saw what happened yesterday.

308
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:11,664
Ohhh, look at this little angel.

309
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,992
I may never go back to work.

310
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:20,743
How the hell am I supposed to take care
of a whole family by myself?

311
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:26,223
I'm so sorry, Barbie.

312
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:28,448
Why didn't he listen?

313
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:35,317
I thought that you hated him.

314
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:38,685
Ah, when it comes to torturing you,
everybody's on the same page.

315
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:40,757
You know, Reid,

316
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:43,477
you had the cojones to stand up to me,

317
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,643
unlike Kershnar,  whom I've so demoralized

318
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:50,169
he's basically my trained chimp.

319
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:57,642
He's almost human.

320
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:01,103
Anyway, I've got enough yes-men.

321
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:04,063
You've got a spine. Join my practice.

322
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:06,040
You can still work out of this hospital,

323
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:09,303
the only difference is you'd make double the money.

324
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:14,966
Easy, buddy. That smell burning your nostrils isn't
just the baby throw-up on her jacket

325
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:17,065
Oh, uh, I got to hold Isabella.

326
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:19,894
She squirted out of my arms, but Carla caught her.

327
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:22,756
It's the smell of a doctor with integrity.

328
00:18:23,997 --> 00:18:26,333
Also, you'll never have to answer to this guy again.

329
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:39,549
- Wow, I got a family.
-  I know.

330
00:18:39,974 --> 00:18:42,036
In seven months, I'm gonna have a family, too.

331
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:47,003
Did you ever think we'd be here back
when we were freshmen in college?

332
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:49,804
Remember that first week

333
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:52,509
when I found you hooking up with my girlfriend, and you said

334
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:55,999
you guys were only naked underneath the covers
because you'd had a water-balloon fight

335
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,000
and you were cold?

336
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:59,060
J.D., for the last time, nothing happened.

337
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,012
Please, this isn't about that.

338
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:05,741
It's just that I looked all over, I never found any balloons.

339
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:09,332
You'd think there'd be some balloons.

340
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:12,885
I look at Isabella, and I get really scared.

341
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:15,670
And I'm gonna need you to be there to help me through this.

342
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,183
Well that sucks, 'cause I was counting on you

343
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:20,021
to make it look easy so I know I can handle it when my turn comes.

344
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:21,648
Awesome.

345
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:25,611
Turk, you're at the beginning of your career.

346
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,094
You know you're gonna make plenty of money.

347
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:30,836
It's good to hear that from you, thank you.

348
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,090
- You're gonna be just fine.
- I suppose so.

349
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:39,621
- ..Totally fine.
- Yeah.

350
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:42,056
Would you mind telling me
that I'm gonna be fine, Turk?

351
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,814
Am I gonna be fine?
I think I'm gonna be fine!

352
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:46,244
Well, I would, but I don't know how much you like Kim.

353
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,683
I really like her.

354
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:50,980
Then you're gonna be fine.

355
00:19:52,448 --> 00:19:53,179
Thanks.

356
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:59,897
Is there anything else you wanna...tell me, or admit to?

357
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:06,184
I mean, I looked everywhere, there was...no signs of balloons.

358
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:08,739
<i>Opportunities are everywhere...</i>

359
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,239
<i>...Whether it's accepting an old job...</i>

360
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:18,844
You can have your dental.

361
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:22,709
Now clean up this mess.

362
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:30,076
<i>..or taking a new job.</i>

363
00:20:31,702 --> 00:20:33,845
I'd...like to join your practice.

364
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:41,366
<i>As for me, I was just excited
to have the opportunity</i>

365
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,546
to get to know the
mother of my child better.

366
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,698
I got offered a new job.

367
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:47,772
Cool! Is it over at County?

368
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:49,536
'Cause that way I can drop you off every morning.

369
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:52,425
It's in Tacoma, Washington.

370
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,236
That's gonna be a little rough on my scooter.
