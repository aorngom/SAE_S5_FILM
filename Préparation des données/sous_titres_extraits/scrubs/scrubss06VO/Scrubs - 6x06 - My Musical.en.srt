1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,183
<i>After 6 weeks home with her baby,</i>

2
00:00:02,184 --> 00:00:05,012
<i>... Carla was facing the decision
that all new moms have to face.</i>

3
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,291
<i>Whether she should
go back to work.</i>

4
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:10,111
Ok, so.
If we take my salary...

5
00:00:10,112 --> 00:00:13,172
... and subtract the cost
of a full-time nanny...

6
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:16,812
... plus her health insurance,
we will still end up with...

7
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:20,252
... losing US$5 a month?!?!

8
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:23,787
This is completely your decision.
I'm ok one way or the other.

9
00:00:23,788 --> 00:00:26,432
Maybe I'll try staying home
with Izzy for a year.

10
00:00:26,816 --> 00:00:27,789
Yes!!!!

11
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:36,594
<i>As for me, ever since my
pregnant girlfriend left...</i>

12
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:38,798
<i>... I've been a little clingy
with my roommate.</i>

13
00:00:38,983 --> 00:00:40,563
JD, I'm going to get a drink
from the water fountain.

14
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:41,166
Do you wanna come?

15
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:44,432
Please, Elliot.
I'm not that desperate.

16
00:00:44,606 --> 00:00:46,211
<i>Although I am a little parched.</i>

17
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:48,644
<i>Plus I could hold back her hair.</i>

18
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:52,595
Are you okay, ma'am?

19
00:00:53,203 --> 00:00:55,493
<i>How many fingers do you see?</i>

20
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:59,104
<i>Call 911 emergency.</i>

21
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:02,226
<i>Why are you singing?</i>

22
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:05,133
<i>Wait!
Why am I singing?</i>

23
00:01:05,745 --> 00:01:07,888
<i>Is there someone here with you?</i>

24
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:11,608
<i>Someone that we could talk to?</i>

25
00:01:12,495 --> 00:01:19,386
<i>Are you okay?
Are you alright?</i>

26
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,697
The mind is a freaky thing, Elliot.

27
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:26,102
Maybe she does hear singing.

28
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:28,188
I haven't sung since
the 6th grade talent show...

29
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,477
... when I did Pat Benatar's
"Hell Is For Children".

30
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:32,758
Then afterwards Mr. Shaman,
the MC, said...

31
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,695
... "No. Actually hell is for everyone who
just had to hear you sing that song."

32
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,976
My mom was so mad, she slept
with him and ruined his marriage.

33
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:39,337
Let's see how she's doing.

34
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:49,110
<i>Hello, I'm Dr. Kelso.</i>

35
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:50,661
<i>I'm delighted that you came.</i>

36
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:52,269
<i>So the doctors say you fainted...</i>

37
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,933
<i>... and you don't know
what's to blame.</i>

38
00:01:54,054 --> 00:01:55,497
<i>Well, put your mind at ease.</i>

39
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:57,181
<i>There's no ill we hadn't outsmarted.</i>

40
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:59,135
<i>On behalf of all who work here...</i>

41
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:04,372
<i>... welcome to Sacred Heart!!</i>

42
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:08,518
<i>Our facilities are excellent,
you couldn't ask for more.</i>

43
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:11,731
<i>As long as you avoid the
bathrooms on the second floor.</i>

44
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,970
<i>This is Dr. Cox,
I'll be giving him your chart.</i>

45
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:19,616
<i>And that's Dr. Kelso,
the kissass of Sacred Heart.</i>

46
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:22,564
<i>You say you burned
your hand real bad,</i>

47
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:25,350
<i>... we'll fix you up with gauze.</i>

48
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:28,742
<i>Perhaps you need
your fat sucked out...</i>

49
00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:30,994
<i>- ... or one smallish nose.
- Hey !</i>

50
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:37,466
<i>If you caught a STD
from some tasty little tart.</i>

51
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:40,927
<i>We swear we won't judge
you here at Sacred... </i>

52
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:50,230
<i>Here at Sacred...
Here at Sacred Heart !!!</i>

53
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,756
<i>One more thing that I should mention...</i>

54
00:03:07,973 --> 00:03:09,540
<i>... if what I heard is true.</i>

55
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:14,259
<i>And everyone appears
to be singing to you.</i>

56
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,608
<i>Your case is very serious.</i>

57
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,091
<i>And we better start.</i>

58
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:23,146
<i>'Cos if you think we're singing,</i>

59
00:03:23,147 --> 00:03:28,260
<i>- ... you belong at Sacred Heart.
- Doctors! Nurses!</i>

60
00:03:28,261 --> 00:03:30,007
<i>Patients! Dead Guys!</i>

61
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:41,807
<i>Welcome to Sacred Heart !!</i>

62
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:09,959
So Mrs. Miller passed both otological
and neurological exams.

63
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,791
We cannot find anything that
explains why she's hearing music.

64
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:14,404
How about this for an explanation:

65
00:04:14,992 --> 00:04:16,572
... she's cuckoo pants.

66
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:19,424
Run some more tests
and turf her to Psych.

67
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:24,961
<i>Hey, Mrs. Miller.</i>

68
00:04:24,962 --> 00:04:27,517
<i>We just need a stool sample.</i>

69
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:29,518
<i>Why do you need a stool sample...</i>

70
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,735
<i>... if you think I'm just a nut?</i>

71
00:04:32,632 --> 00:04:34,004
<i>- 'Cause the answer is not...
- 'Cause the answer is not...</i>

72
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,285
<i>- ... in your head, my dear.
- ... in your head, my dear.</i>

73
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,068
<i>- It's in your butt.
- It's in your butt.</i>

74
00:04:38,193 --> 00:04:41,989
<i>You see?
Everything comes down to poo.</i>

75
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,774
<i>From the top of your head
to the sole of your shoe.</i>

76
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:48,535
<i>We can figure out
what is wrong with you...</i>

77
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:50,706
<i>... by looking at your poo.</i>

78
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:51,682
<i>Turk.</i>

79
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:54,240
<i>Do you have a hemorrhoid?</i>

80
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:56,893
<i>Or is it rectal cancer?</i>

81
00:04:57,454 --> 00:04:59,798
<i>When you flush your dookie down...</i>

82
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,700
<i>... you flush away the answer.</i>

83
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:07,822
<i>It doesn't really matter
if it's hard of it's loose.</i>

84
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:11,049
<i>We'll figure out what's ailing you.</i>

85
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,226
<i>As long as it's a deuce.
Yes !</i>

86
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,058
<i>-Everything comes down to poo.
-Everything comes down to poo.</i>

87
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:20,056
<i>Cardiovascular, lymphatic, yes
the nervous system too.</i>

88
00:05:20,343 --> 00:05:23,276
<i>All across the nation,
we trust in defecation.</i>

89
00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:25,607
<i>Everything comes down to poo.</i>

90
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:28,985
<i>If you want to know what's wrong...</i>

91
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:31,830
<i>... don't sit and act so cool.</i>

92
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:34,761
<i>Just be a man and eat some bran.</i>

93
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:37,567
<i>And drop the kids off at the pool.</i>

94
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,801
<i>- My stomach hurts.
- Check the poo.</i>

95
00:05:41,343 --> 00:05:43,866
<i>- I sprained my ankle.
- Check the poo.</i>

96
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,812
<i>- I was shot.
- Check the poo.</i>

97
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,418
<i>- A homeless guy just pooed in my eye.
- Check the poo.</i>

98
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:53,099
<i>- Mine or his?
- First him then you.</i>

99
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:56,472
<i>It may sound gross.</i>

100
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:58,882
<i>You may say "shush".</i>

101
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:04,423
<i>But we need to see what
comes out of your tush.</i>

102
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:06,154
<i>Because...</i>

103
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,620
<i>... everything comes down to poo.</i>

104
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:12,659
<i>Whether it is a tumor
or a touch of the flu.</i>

105
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:15,718
<i>Please, won't you pinch
us all a big fat clue.</i>

106
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:18,648
<i>Our number one test
is your number two.</i>

107
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,835
<i>If there's no breeze,
light a match please.</i>

108
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:24,203
<i>Everything comes down to...</i>

109
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:25,829
<i>- Doo doo.
- Doo doo.</i>

110
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,444
<i>- Doo doo.
- Doo doo.</i>

111
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:29,838
<i>Everything comes down to poo!!</i>

112
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:33,754
Guess what, you guys?

113
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:35,917
I put an offer on a little house...

114
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:37,657
... and it just got accepted.

115
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:40,174
- Congratulations.
- That's awesome!!

116
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,264
- My own house.
- C'mon, baby. See ya!!

117
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:45,223
I'm so excited for us.

118
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,945
Does he think that
he's moving in with me?

119
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:50,558
That would be a yes.

120
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:53,077
Excuse me, ex-nurse Turkelton.

121
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:55,612
But if you want to
hang out around here...

122
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:57,866
... you're going to
need a visitor's badge.

123
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:01,959
<i>So, Carla...</i>

124
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,670
<i>... when will you be back?</i>

125
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:08,687
<i>Not for a year.</i>

126
00:07:09,313 --> 00:07:12,110
<i>A year?!?!</i>

127
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:20,817
<i>Not for one long,
long year.</i>

128
00:07:25,763 --> 00:07:27,932
<i>We understand you love that kid.</i>

129
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:30,300
<i>But this ain't no way to treat us.</i>

130
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:32,637
<i>And I hesitate to say you did...</i>

131
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:34,828
<i>... what Judas done to Jesus.</i>

132
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:37,223
<i>When you leave us all,
we'll be upset.</i>

133
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,534
Look out.
That floor is very wet.

134
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:41,470
<i>We're gonna miss you, Carla.</i>

135
00:07:41,605 --> 00:07:43,980
<i>We're gonna miss you 'round here.</i>

136
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:46,148
<i>We're gonna miss you, Carla.</i>

137
00:07:46,316 --> 00:07:49,001
<i>We're saying this
through a lot of tears.</i>

138
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,161
<i>How will everybody
get along without you... </i>

139
00:07:51,162 --> 00:07:53,337
<i>... for a long, long year?</i>

140
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:57,058
<i>Who'll tell me that my
new toupee looks sweet?</i>

141
00:07:57,806 --> 00:08:01,275
<i>Who'll treat my gay son's rash
and be discreet?</i>

142
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,893
<i>Who'll give me better ways
to say "man meat"?</i>

143
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:08,848
- Pincho chiquito.
- Thanks. I'm using that.

144
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,425
<i>We're gonna miss you 'round here.</i>

145
00:08:11,818 --> 00:08:13,888
<i>We're gonna miss you, Carla.</i>

146
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:16,805
<i>We're saying this
through a lot of tears.</i>

147
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:18,786
<i>How will everybody
get along without you...</i>

148
00:08:18,787 --> 00:08:21,153
<i>... for a long, long year?</i>

149
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:25,591
<i>My baby made the choice
to be at home and not at work.</i>

150
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:30,459
<i>So let us all rejoice 'cause
she's the brand new mama Turk.</i>

151
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,511
<i>He's right, of course.</i>

152
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,784
<i>And yet my heart in spite of this...</i>

153
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:36,729
<i>- ... feels torn apart.
- We're gonna miss you, Carla.</i>

154
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:39,542
<i>We're gonna miss you 'round here.</i>

155
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:41,720
<i>I need a tissue, Carla.</i>

156
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,186
<i>We're saying this
through a lot of tears.</i>

157
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:46,455
<i>How we ever gonna
get along without you?</i>

158
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:48,925
<i>How we ever gonna
get along without you?</i>

159
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:51,183
<i>How we ever gonna
get along without you?</i>

160
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:52,927
Lunch!!

161
00:08:53,568 --> 00:09:02,708
<i>It's gonna be a long, long year.</i>

162
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:09,688
<i>Dr. Cox, I'm not crazy.</i>

163
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:12,446
<i>Am I still singing?</i>

164
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,618
<i>Singing like a bird.</i>

165
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:17,719
<i>Dr. Cox, huge news.</i>

166
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,721
<i>I pulled some strings and got the
parking spot right behind yours.</i>

167
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,832
<i>Bumper buddies.</i>

168
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:30,835
<i>Still, you're not nearly as bad as her.</i>

169
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:35,084
<i>Do you know how much you annoy me?</i>

170
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:37,785
The answer is: a lot.

171
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,918
<i>Should I list the reasons why?</i>

172
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,266
<i>Well, I don't see why not.</i>

173
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:46,955
<i> It's your hair, your nose, your chinless
face, you always need a hug. </i>

174
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:49,551
<i>Not to mention all the manly
appletinis that you chug.</i>

175
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:52,053
<i>That you think I am your mentor
just continues to perplex.</i>

176
00:09:52,054 --> 00:09:54,538
<i>And, oh my God, stop telling me
when you have nerdy sex.</i>

177
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:56,487
By the way, last time
Kim was in town...

178
00:09:56,488 --> 00:09:59,210
... we got some appletinis and
poured them on her good parts.

179
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:01,852
<i>See now, Newbie? That's the thing
you do that drives me up a tree.</i>

180
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:04,157
<i>'Cos no matter how I rant
at you, you never let me be.</i>

181
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:06,785
<i>So I'm stuck with all your daydreaming,
your wish to be my son.</i>

182
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:09,312
<i> It makes me suicidal and
I'm not the only one.</i>

183
00:10:09,313 --> 00:10:11,789
<i>No I'm not the only one...</i>

184
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,942
<i>It all started with
a penny in the door.</i>

185
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:26,528
<i>There was a hatred
I had never felt before.</i>

186
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,070
<i>So now I make him pay,</i>

187
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:35,378
<i>...  each and every day.</i>

188
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:45,840
<i> Until that moussed hair
little nuance is no more.</i>

189
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,919
<i>So now that is why I call you
names like Carol, Jane and Sue.</i>

190
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,521
<i>Like Moesha, Kim and Lilly
and Suzanne and Betty Lou.</i>

191
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:55,016
<i> Regardless of the names I pick
my feelings are quite clear.</i>

192
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:57,777
<i>You're a pain in every day
of every month of every year.</i>

193
00:10:57,922 --> 00:11:00,590
<i> Dr. Cox, you gotta help me
'cos I really am distressed.</i>

194
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:03,021
<i>Can't you find another option,
won't you run another test?</i>

195
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:05,592
<i>If you want some kind of favor,
really any kind of favor, </i>

196
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:08,355
<i>... please just get me peace and
quiet from this godforsaken pest.</i>

197
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:11,426
I think what my bumper
buddy is trying to say...

198
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:14,410
<i>Shut your cakehole, Marybeth.</i>

199
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:19,347
<i>Or I swear to God
I'll shut it soon.</i>

200
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:24,301
<i>Congratulations, we'll schedule
your test this afternoon.</i>

201
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,899
I know JD's in a bad place.
But I'm an adult.

202
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,795
I'm making good money.
I just wanna live by myself.

203
00:11:33,796 --> 00:11:35,743
So just tell him.

204
00:11:36,218 --> 00:11:38,311
So it's that easy?
Why don't you just tell Turk...

205
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:39,669
... that you wanna
go back to work?

206
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,505
What the hell am I gonna do?

207
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:45,785
<i>- I could tell a bunch of lies.
- I could buy him his own place.</i>

208
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:49,698
<i>- I could bring the baby here with me.
- Or tell him there's no space.</i>

209
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,439
Those are some lameass ideas.

210
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,014
We're so screwed.

211
00:11:58,243 --> 00:12:00,658
<i>I'm sure you must be scared.</i>

212
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:02,848
<i>Not knowing what
this test will bring.</i>

213
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:04,991
<i>It could prove
that you are crazy.</i>

214
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,361
<i>Do you still hear people sing?</i>

215
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:10,437
<i>It's best to know the truth.</i>

216
00:12:10,656 --> 00:12:12,496
<i>Of that I have no doubt.</i>

217
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:15,583
<i>But you'll have to face the future.</i>

218
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:17,265
<i>When the truth comes out.</i>

219
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:20,483
<i>We are running a test
that's a waste of our time.</i>

220
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:22,651
<i>But at least she'll accept
she's medically fine.</i>

221
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:24,990
<i>She'll admit that she's nuts
or I'll have to say "snore".</i>

222
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:28,090
<i>Just give her the CAT-Scan
and show her the door.</i>

223
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,877
<i>While we process your results,</i>

224
00:12:31,062 --> 00:12:32,775
<i>... we'll take you back to wait.</i>

225
00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:34,499
<i>We've got drugs to calm you down.</i>

226
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,614
<i>So you don't stress about your fate.</i>

227
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:38,426
<i>It's best to know the truth.</i>

228
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,340
<i>Of that we have no doubt.</i>

229
00:12:40,341 --> 00:12:43,955
<i>- But you'll have to face the future.
- Face the future...</i>

230
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:45,311
<i>... when the truth comes out.</i>

231
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:47,235
<i>You're gonna miss it, Carla.</i>

232
00:12:47,236 --> 00:12:49,265
<i>You're gonna miss it 'round here.</i>

233
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:51,004
<i>Gonna hurt him badly.</i>

234
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:54,871
<i>But you can't stay away
for one whole year.</i>

235
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:58,679
<i>- I know that I'm not crazy.
- Everything comes down to poo.</i>

236
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,571
<i>- I think that I'm not crazy.
- When we move I'm gonna have...</i>

237
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,941
<i>...  my own private loo.</i>

238
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:06,896
<i>How am I supposed to tell him
that he's not moving too?</i>

239
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:09,469
<i>- Oh my God.
- He doesn't have a clue.</i>

240
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,226
<i>I'm crazy.</i>

241
00:13:11,227 --> 00:13:14,059
<i>If you like to reconsider,
I'd be glad to do my part.</i>

242
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:22,383
<i>If you want your job is open,
come on back to Sacred Heart.</i>

243
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:25,674
Look at the temporal lobe.

244
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:27,312
That could be why
she's hearing music.

245
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:28,857
The biggest aneurysm I've ever seen.

246
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:30,274
The woman is a time-bomb.

247
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,770
<i>Sometimes you're better off not knowing.</i>

248
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,615
<i>But this isn't one of those times.</i>

249
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:36,594
<i>Your world's become a musical.</i>

250
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:38,338
<i>And your doctors speak in rhymes.</i>

251
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:39,935
<i>It's best to know the truth.</i>

252
00:13:40,137 --> 00:13:41,876
<i>Of that we have no doubt.</i>

253
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:46,158
<i>- But you'll have to face the future...
- How can I tell him?</i>

254
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,700
<i>- How can I tell him?
- How can I tell her?</i>

255
00:13:49,701 --> 00:13:53,027
<i>You'll have to face the future
when the truth comes out.</i>

256
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:57,936
<i>So Dr. Cox, is it serious?</i>

257
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:02,450
Oh...

258
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:13,638
<i>When the truth comes out.</i>

259
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:18,824
Okay, we've to tell them.

260
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,152
They're so close. Maybe they'll
help each other through it.

261
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,512
Come on, Carla. They're guys.

262
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,927
They're not gonna get all touchy-feely.

263
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,375
<i>Let's face the facts
about me and you...</i>

264
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:32,550
<i>... a love unspecified.</i>

265
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:36,365
<i>Though I'm proud to
call you "Chocolate Bear",</i>

266
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:40,110
<i>... the crowd will always
talk and stare.</i>

267
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:43,385
<i>I feel exactly those feelings too.</i>

268
00:14:43,574 --> 00:14:46,318
<i>And that's why
I keep them inside.</i>

269
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:50,051
<i>'Cause this bear can't bear
the world's disdain.</i>

270
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:52,835
<i>And sometimes is easier to hide...</i>

271
00:14:52,836 --> 00:14:55,223
<i>- ... than explain our Guy Love.
- ... than explain our Guy Love.</i>

272
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:57,032
<i>- That's all it is.
- That's all it is.</i>

273
00:14:57,428 --> 00:15:00,498
<i>- Guy Love, he's mine, I'm his.
- Guy Love, he's mine, I'm his.</i>

274
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:03,139
<i>- There's nothing gay about it...
- There's nothing gay about it...</i>

275
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:05,861
<i>- ... in our eyes.
- ... in our eyes.</i>

276
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:10,750
<i>You ask me about this thing we share.</i>

277
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:15,401
<i>And he tenderly replies.</i>

278
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,634
<i>It's guy love...</i>

279
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:21,920
<i>- ... between two guys.
- ... between two guys.</i>

280
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,217
<i>We're closer than the
average man & wife.</i>

281
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:29,395
<i>That's why our matching
bracelets say "Turk & JD"</i>

282
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:33,192
<i>You know I'll stick by you
for the rest of my life.</i>

283
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:37,120
<i>You're the only man
who's ever been inside of me.</i>

284
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,206
I just took out his appendix.

285
00:15:39,747 --> 00:15:43,098
<i>- There's no need to clarify.
- Oh no?</i>

286
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:45,964
<i>Just let it grow more
and more each day.</i>

287
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,065
<i>It's like I married my best friend.</i>

288
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:52,603
<i>But in a totally manly way.</i>

289
00:15:52,604 --> 00:15:53,636
<i>- Let's go.
- Let's go.</i>

290
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:57,197
<i>- It's guy love, don't compromise...
- It's guy love, don't compromise...</i>

291
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,643
<i>- ... the feeling of some other guy.
- ... the feeling of some other guy.</i>

292
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:03,049
<i>- Holding up your heart...
- Holding up your heart...</i>

293
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,985
<i>- ... into the sky.
- ... into the sky.</i>

294
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:10,730
<i>I'll be there to care through all the lows.</i>

295
00:16:10,731 --> 00:16:15,322
<i>I'll be there to share the highs.</i>

296
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:21,966
<i>- It's guy love between two guys.
- It's guy love between two guys.</i>

297
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:25,896
<i>And when I say
"I love you, Turk".</i>

298
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:31,082
<i>It's not what it implies.</i>

299
00:16:32,604 --> 00:16:35,232
<i>- It's guy love...
- It's guy love...</i>

300
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:37,446
<i>- ... between...
- ... between...</i>

301
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,956
<i>- ... two...
- ... two...</i>

302
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:45,030
<i>- ... guys.
- ... guys.</i>

303
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:47,210
No hands.

304
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:56,919
Okay, I'll go first.

305
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,101
JD, I wanna live by myself.

306
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,787
Okay, no problem.

307
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:02,669
Turk, will you relay this?

308
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:05,499
That means you guys
are no longer talking.

309
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,707
JD ?!

310
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,770
Wait a second.
What did she mean she'll go first?

311
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:11,463
Turk, I wanna come back to work.
It's who I am.

312
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:15,891
I always thought family was the most
important thing to Puerto Ricans.

313
00:17:18,952 --> 00:17:22,392
<i>I've had it up to here
so let me make it very clear.</i>

314
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:25,302
<i>Because I swear I'll never
hook you in again.</i>

315
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:27,322
<i>Everytime that you profess... </i>

316
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:29,119
<i>- ... I come from Puerto Rico.
- Yes.</i>

317
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,361
<i>For the last time, Turk,
I'm Dominican.</i>

318
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:37,927
<i>Don't make a big to-do,
I was simply testing you.</i>

319
00:17:38,106 --> 00:17:41,153
<i>Then why'd you tell JD
our baby is "Blaxican"?</i>

320
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:42,934
<i>Baby, you know
I know the truth.</i>

321
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,824
<i>Well, I need a little proof, so...</i>

322
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:47,954
<i>... list all you know about me
or no sex again.</i>

323
00:17:48,132 --> 00:17:48,993
Let's see...

324
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:51,386
<i>- Your name is Carla.
- Oh yes.</i>

325
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:53,389
<i>- You are Latina.
- Impressive.</i>

326
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,609
<i>You are a nurse,
your mother is dead and...</i>

327
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,689
Wait !
I got it.

328
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,405
<i>- Three sisters.
- Turk!!</i>

329
00:17:58,406 --> 00:17:59,600
<i>Two sisters?</i>

330
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:03,549
<i>But I'm sure you have a brother
who is a huge jerkoff.</i>

331
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,928
<i>- Tell me what's my middle name.
- Ok. I'm tired of this game.</i>

332
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:08,516
<i>Let's forget it.
I give up.</i>

333
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:09,827
<i>I guess you win again.</i>

334
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,302
<i>But it's not just me who gets mixed up...</i>

335
00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:15,548
<i>- ...  by all this crazy ethnic stuff.
- Sorry. Even I know.</i>

336
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:17,052
<i>She's Dominican.
Booya!</i>

337
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:20,050
<i>Did I grow up in Illinois
or was it Michigan?</i>

338
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:23,550
<i>How long before we met
was I in Medicine?</i>

339
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:26,984
<i>Was our wedding song
The Beatles or Led Zepellin?</i>

340
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:30,500
<i>Am I freakin' Puerto Rican
or Dominican?</i>

341
00:18:30,883 --> 00:18:33,622
<i>The thing is guys remember facts...</i>

342
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:37,676
<i>... like what Derek Jeter hit
last year which was 303.</i>

343
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:40,437
<i>And that is why
our brains are maxed.</i>

344
00:18:40,826 --> 00:18:44,690
<i>And there's no room for things
like birthdays or ethnicities.</i>

345
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,383
<i>Well, thank you
for that glimpse...</i>

346
00:18:46,384 --> 00:18:48,295
<i>... into the workings of
the inner man.</i>

347
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:49,741
<i>Let's talk about
your job and...</i>

348
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:51,762
<i>- ... not the fact that you're...
- ... Dominican.</i>

349
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:52,763
<i>You're not staying
home from work.</i>

350
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,929
<i>Will that make
you happy, Turk?</i>

351
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,750
<i>I'll support you if you
choose to earn the Benjamins.</i>

352
00:18:58,197 --> 00:18:59,956
<i>Then I'll return to work today.</i>

353
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:01,706
<i>Now you showed
that that's okay.</i>

354
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:04,621
<i>I say "si" which is
"yes" in Dominican.</i>

355
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:06,580
<i>- And Puerto Rican.
- Turk!!!</i>

356
00:19:06,581 --> 00:19:08,308
<i>But you're Dominican.</i>

357
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:10,803
Look, JD.

358
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:13,761
I don't wanna let you down
when your life is so crappy.

359
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,868
- Move in with me.
- No, Elliot. It's okay.

360
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:19,876
I was just feeling
sorry for myself.

361
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:21,745
Plus, it's about time
you lived on your own.

362
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:23,507
You're closer to 40 than 30.

363
00:19:24,242 --> 00:19:25,555
JD, I'm 29.

364
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:27,020
I'm playing with you.
Listen.

365
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:28,859
We're gonna be fine.
You know why?

366
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:33,552
<i>We'll be friends forever.</i>

367
00:19:33,553 --> 00:19:35,521
<i>We're gonna be
friends forever.</i>

368
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:39,181
<i>We will always be true.</i>

369
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:43,459
<i>Friends forever.
We're gonna be friends forever.</i>

370
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:46,878
<i>I'll always be there for you.</i>

371
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:51,553
<i>- We're as close as...
- ... the vena cava and the aorta.</i>

372
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:55,410
<i>- We're best friends just like...
- ... amoxacilin and clavulanic acid.</i>

373
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,342
<i>The tibia and the fibula.
The left and right ventricule.</i>

374
00:19:57,343 --> 00:19:59,371
<i>A hypodermic needle
and a latex tourniquet.</i>

375
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,312
<i>Diverticulitis and
a barium enema.</i>

376
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:05,460
<i>- The vena cava and the aorta.
- Amoxacilin and clavulanic acid.</i>

377
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:07,307
<i>The tibia, the fibula.
The left and right ventricule.</i>

378
00:20:07,308 --> 00:20:09,330
<i>A hypodermic needle
and a latex tourniquet.</i>

379
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:11,403
<i>- The vena cava and the aorta.
- We'll be friends...</i>

380
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:13,449
<i>- Amoxacilin and clavulanic acid.
- ... forever.</i>

381
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,364
<i>The tibia, the fibula.
The left and right ventricule.</i>

382
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:16,942
<i>A hypodermic needle and a...</i>

383
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:21,719
<i>What's going to happen?</i>

384
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:24,696
<i>What does the future hold?</i>

385
00:20:24,697 --> 00:20:27,576
<i>So many things that I put off.</i>

386
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:35,218
<i>Assuming I'd have time.
Assuming I'd grow old.</i>

387
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:38,768
<i>What's going to happen?</i>

388
00:20:39,954 --> 00:20:43,768
<i>And will I be alive tomorrow?</i>

389
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:46,665
<i>What's going to happen...</i>

390
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:52,466
<i>... to me?</i>

391
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,232
<i>You're going to be okay.</i>

392
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:57,899
<i>That's what's going to happen.</i>

393
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:02,131
<i>Everything is okay.</i>

394
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:04,979
<i>We're right here beside you.</i>

395
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,377
<i>We won't let you slip away.</i>

396
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:11,275
<i>Plan for tomorrow.</i>

397
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,251
<i>'Cause we swear to you...</i>

398
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:20,045
<i>... you're going to be okay.</i>

399
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:24,020
<i>I'm going to be okay.</i>

400
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:26,713
<i>That's what's going to happen.</i>

401
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:31,775
<i>- Everything is okay.
- Everything is okay.</i>

402
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:36,154
<i>We will never leave you.
Right here we will stay.</i>

403
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,745
<i>- Plan for tomorrow.
- Plan for tomorrow.</i>

404
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,534
<i>'Cause we swear to you...</i>

405
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:48,534
<i>... you're going to be okay.</i>

406
00:21:50,362 --> 00:21:51,899
We hope.

407
00:22:00,196 --> 00:22:01,758
Did it work?

408
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:03,553
You're gonna have to tell us.

409
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,653
Thank you.

410
00:22:11,284 --> 00:22:12,896
By the way,
who's the best singer?

411
00:22:13,273 --> 00:22:14,810
You know,
in your head.

412
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,336
Don't let the fact that
I went to theater camp...

413
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,501
... affect your decision.

414
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:21,049
<i>In musicals, there's
always a happy ending.</i>

415
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:22,466
<i>But in life, </i>

416
00:22:23,082 --> 00:22:25,107
<i>... sometimes when you
get what you want,</i>

417
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:28,009
<i>... you end up missing
what you left behind.</i>

418
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:32,173
<i>Whether it's your roommate...</i>

419
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:35,463
I'll see you in a little while.

420
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:38,623
<i>... or time spent with your child.</i>

421
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:46,570
<i>Or even the music you
used to hear in your head.</i>
