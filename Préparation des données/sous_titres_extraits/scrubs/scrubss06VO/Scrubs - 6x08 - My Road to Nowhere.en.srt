1
00:00:00,673 --> 00:00:03,305
Not only did I have a long distance
girlfriend who was pregnant,

2
00:00:03,306 --> 00:00:05,070
but I still hadn't found an apartment.

3
00:00:05,663 --> 00:00:08,012
So I was living on my half-acre
...in a tent.

4
00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:11,186
A haunted tent.

5
00:00:17,872 --> 00:00:20,889
- Stop stealing our power!
- You are ruining our neighborhood!

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,568
Oh, really, Donna?! I'm ruining the
neighborhood? At least I'm quiet!

7
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:28,527
Were you guys having sex last night,
or raping a baboon?!

8
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:30,685
I wasn't home last night.

9
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:32,190
My bad.

10
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:35,795
- I'm gonna beat your ass!
- Donnaagh!

11
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:40,631
* Donna beating JD's ass *

12
00:00:41,036 --> 00:00:44,671
Check out Ted-buddy,
don't like to give her a ride, uh?

13
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:47,413
Ooh, you bet-cha!

14
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:48,950
Over here, perv.

15
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:54,082
It's for my retirement, so Inid and
I can see the country in luxury.

16
00:00:55,344 --> 00:01:02,241
- So it's a wheelchair accessable for her, sir?
- Ted, I'm not retiring for at least three years.

17
00:01:02,372 --> 00:01:04,791
If she's still alive, I'll deal with it then.

18
00:01:04,954 --> 00:01:08,027
Now, take the rest of the day off,
and get it washed and waxed.

19
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:13,500
You smell like my mom, meowgr!

20
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:19,961
Allright, Mr. Marioni, mazel tov!

21
00:01:19,962 --> 00:01:23,485
You are the proud owner
of yet another kidney stone.

22
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:27,388
- Did you try laying off the red meat, buddy?
- I'm trying Doc, but it's hard.

23
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:30,853
"I'm in", Kim's having the
first ultrasound tomorrow.

24
00:01:31,288 --> 00:01:34,949
Woow, there is nothing like that
first ultrasound, bring tissue

25
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:39,101
You kid me? I can't just up and leave,
I gotta find an apartment, I live in a teepee.

26
00:01:39,428 --> 00:01:41,716
DOOORIAN!

27
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,112
You have been wrong about
so many things that...

28
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,808
...I'm not even going to say something's
wrong anymore, instead I'm going to say

29
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:52,390
It's Dorian!

30
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:55,197
And the fact that you'll be willing skip seeing
that child's heartbeat

31
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,351
for the first time...it's just plain Dorian!

32
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:02,672
I mean, hell, Jordan is having her second
ultrasound and I couldn't be more giddy

33
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:05,171
I can't wait to find out the sex
of that unborn tax-break.

34
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,268
Jordan doesn't let you know

35
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:09,377
- the sex until the baby is born.
- Dorian, again!

36
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:12,425
That I don't know if it's
the hormones or if the baby

37
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:16,275
is actually eating the the bitch-cells
but Jordan has...softened.

38
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:21,077
In fact last night she...
she ask me to cuddle her.

39
00:02:21,756 --> 00:02:23,150
<i>Is cuddling bad now?!</i>

40
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:29,725
Baby, I need permission to road trip JD
to Tacoma, so he can see his ultrasound.

41
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:30,844
Sure!

42
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:34,750
I think not giving you permission to do this
for your friend would be totally Dorian!

43
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:37,318
<i>How is this spreading so quickly?!</i>

44
00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:38,684
Gandhi?!

45
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:43,660
Did you tell Jordan what I said
about her wanting to cuddle?

46
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,472
She doesn't like people to know
that she actually cares... for me.

47
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:51,045
Relax...she's pregnant, what can she possibly do?

48
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,166
- Aaargh!
- Whooo!

49
00:02:56,716 --> 00:02:57,523
Aaargh!!!

50
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:02,823
Good boy Jack, good boy!

51
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:09,077
- He can possibly made this "muffle", right?
- Dorian! Ooh, Damn it! Now I'm doing it.

52
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,530
Careful, he's going feedled.

53
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,214
[Cox is coughing]

54
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:30,821
<i>The secret to a great road trip is to get
as many people as possible to come along</i>

55
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:33,297
- So, are you guys in?
- Totally!!

56
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,427
Last road trip I went on was with my
sorority sisters and I went to Tijuana.

57
00:03:36,428 --> 00:03:37,736
So, it will be nice to go with people

58
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:40,799
- who actually like me.
- Why are you always so hard on yourself?

59
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,054
- Your sorority sister probably loved you.
- Keith, they tried to sell me.

60
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:48,250
You know Keith? If the buyer hadn't
been an undercover "Federale",

61
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:50,438
Elliott would be a slave somewhere...

62
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,863
...there wouldn't be any unconfortable
sexual tension between us...

63
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:56,320
... and you and I would probably be best-friends.

64
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:58,998
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

65
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:03,705
Keith!!

66
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:09,500
Oh. Uhm, we still can't make it...we made
plans to find a hangout with my grandma.

67
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:12,724
Oh, Keith, that woman is 96 years old,
there will be plenty of weekend for that.

68
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:13,989
- Road trip!!
- This way.

69
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,613
Ok.

70
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:20,366
You know, you are one special lady, Carla.

71
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:25,697
It's not every wife that works a full shift,
and goes home to change baby's diapers

72
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,842
while her husband and his girlfriend

73
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:31,284
spend the weekend mooning
truckers and playing slut-boog.

74
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:34,745
- It's not a big deal.
- Oh, but it is.

75
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:38,448
If you keep letting Gandhi do
wheter he pleases when...

76
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,398
...ever he pleases, while you
take care of the baby,

77
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:46,745
eventually, you're not even gonna have
time to shave your legs or groove your face

78
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:49,893
thus making the most prominent
male figure in your daughter life...

79
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:51,097
You.

80
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:57,791
Adios, Pickle. As soon as I change
out of this clothes, I'm outta here.

81
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:01,917
I'm going, you're staying.

82
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,300
How d'you do that?!

83
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,050
Gandhi, I'm great at this stuff.
Don't ever talk to Jordan again.

84
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:13,419
ROAD TRIP!!

85
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,019
- Where's chocolate bear?
- Getting to know his daughter!

86
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:21,366
<i>I knew that little "ten" baby will eventually ruin everything.</i>

87
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:24,905
- Keith, keep that thing, sweetie.
- Uhm, I can't

88
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:30,149
- Rowdie needs to see the world.
- We need a bigger ride.

89
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:37,743
<i>You guys know where I can find a giant carwash?</i>

90
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:42,020
[People laughing]
Ooh, right!

91
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:45,045
Whoho, I've got friends!

92
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:52,979
- Hey, cutie!
- Hey!

93
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,035
Oh, like there's a chance I meant you.

94
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:57,135
So you're here for your ultrasound, huh?

95
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,098
I can't believe you cannot let him know
the sex, especially when you could...

96
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:06,898
- No, that's too mean, I couldn't do it.
- No, mean is good, er... I like mean.

97
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:10,087
You can learn the sex, not tell Perry,

98
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:13,547
hold it over his head, and play
him like your little bitch-boy.

99
00:06:14,432 --> 00:06:17,005
Perry was so wrong about you!

100
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:20,649
You're not an idiotic skull-pull-tonic
basketball dribbling

101
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,015
Blood Sugar watching idiotic man-boy!

102
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,033
Stop, haha...

103
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:29,083
huh huh, this thing is awesome.

104
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,584
Let's roll these Kimonos

105
00:06:32,762 --> 00:06:33,719
I don't know, but there is

106
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,579
- a stripper pole in the back.
- Carla's got some serious moves.

107
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,463
She can even do an inverted spread leg pole spin

108
00:06:41,982 --> 00:06:43,239
You know that's what they're called,

109
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,076
it's not like I...took a pole
dancing class or anything.

110
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,400
Nice cover.

111
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:52,674
Don't touch the Kimonos those are for Dr. Kelso various masseuses

112
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:55,802
- Ted, who's driving?
- Ooops, my bad.

113
00:06:57,522 --> 00:06:59,325
Maybe I should drive, so we don't all die.

114
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,808
No fants, Ted.

115
00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:02,426
None taken.

116
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,857
I wish that none of us had to drive.

117
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:12,755
We are cruising at a comfortable speed, Dr.
Dorian, and should arrive up to the schedule.

118
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,464
- Could you possibly do me a small favor?
- Of course, Jolly 2-3000.

119
00:07:17,842 --> 00:07:18,256
Could you

120
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:21,195
- rub that spot, off my dashboard?
- You've got it, pal.

121
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,320
- Oh, yeah! Just point back.
- All right.

122
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:25,796
That's the stuff, you bitch!

123
00:07:28,403 --> 00:07:31,839
It can get lonely on the road,
even for computers.

124
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,699
- But this is gonna be great, right?
- I miss my baby...we have to go back.

125
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:45,081
Now, if we slide the wand over here,
we'll se if it's a boy or a girl.

126
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:51,068
- Waiit. Change of plans, Per. Beat it!
- No no, no. You committed

127
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:53,174
to find enough the sex
of the child, this time.

128
00:07:53,175 --> 00:07:56,985
Oh yeah, I am gonna find out the sex
of the child, but you're not, unless

129
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:59,868
you were gonna retain Jack for
the parent-child dancer side-o.

130
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:05,011
Jordan...the boy already
lipsinks into your tampons,

131
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:08,307
must we put a final nail
in this tiny gay coffin?

132
00:08:08,517 --> 00:08:12,684
- Moma wants you at her feet.
- Tell her she can't do this.

133
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:16,499
I would, but once she looks at me my inside get all cold.

134
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,488
You're a coward! You're a coward!

135
00:08:22,347 --> 00:08:26,937
Wo-ow...did you re-cage your mouth
for some unexpected reason?

136
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,624
*  "Guy Love"  ringtone
from "My Musical" episode  *

137
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:34,028
- Here, I--here, here...
- I can't do...

138
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:40,650
Beardface! Can you get your foot
go 90ish...yeah. That a boy!

139
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:48,032
Yeah!

140
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:52,074
That was awesome!
...But uncool!

141
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:55,798
He's not answering.

142
00:08:56,478 --> 00:08:57,480
Something's wrong with the baby.

143
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:00,211
- I'm telling Elliot to turn over home.
- No no no no no. Calm, my darling.

144
00:09:00,212 --> 00:09:04,185
Everything's fine with the baby,
fine with...hey, what's that?

145
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:04,760
Waah!

146
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:10,213
- Now i'll let ya out when ya calm down!
- Open this door, JD!

147
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:13,559
And then I realized my dad had
hugged me at my graduation,

148
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:17,314
not with his arms, you know,
but with his brain.

149
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:24,183
- Keith! Come and give me company, I'm lonely.
- Yeah, you know who else is lonely?

150
00:09:24,184 --> 00:09:26,811
- My grandma!
- No, she's not, Keith.

151
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:30,523
She's a lesbian and nursing
homefold old ladies. You do the math.

152
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:33,239
We can solve both our problems, if we can get

153
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,700
- My grand mother together with your mom.
- Excuse me?!

154
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:40,390
My mother sleeps with men, i've seen it!

155
00:09:40,835 --> 00:09:45,260
- Hey calm down, mama's boy!
- Bring it on, Tall on 60!

156
00:09:45,403 --> 00:09:47,491
- Kick his ass, Ted!
-That's enough!

157
00:09:47,492 --> 00:09:50,107
You guys can't get along, so
sit down and don't talk!

158
00:09:51,118 --> 00:09:52,151
Ain't meant to do that.

159
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:56,999
- What are you doing here?
- I'll tell you what i wasn't doing here.

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,209
I was not taking a nap on company
time in Dr.Kelso's mobile home.

161
00:10:00,485 --> 00:10:03,918
Not this guy...Yaaawn! Back to work.

162
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:14,844
- I don't think he knew we were moving.
- Elliot, stop!

163
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,303
So can i stop squeezing our bratz,
or is it another stupid boy?

164
00:10:26,846 --> 00:10:27,594
Oh-oh.

165
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,768
Excuse me for a second.

166
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:35,452
Oh-oh?! Don't say "oh-oh"...

167
00:10:36,163 --> 00:10:38,350
- ...on a road trip right now?
- There's a little bit between road trip and

168
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:40,229
- I'm sorry, on a road trip right now...
- telling 'bout your...

169
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,563
Follow him. He said "oh-oh".

170
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:50,393
- Ok. I'll get you up.
- Wow haw-wow how.

171
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,310
- He's fine. Let's get going.
- Look at us.

172
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,565
I hurt my ankle, Ted may have a
broken arm, ant the janitor is blind.

173
00:10:59,254 --> 00:11:02,966
Hey, wait...no...coming back...hello.

174
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:07,763
- Who's making pancakes?
- See? he's great, and so's Ted.

175
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:13,397
Waaaah Aaaagh! Ooh...i think it popped back in the joint

176
00:11:13,491 --> 00:11:19,697
You guys, Turk told me how amazing
it was when he saw Izzy's ultrasound.

177
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,328
Can I say something?

178
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:31,063
I don't know this young man.
I wish I did. I admire his spirit,

179
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:35,593
and if he says we must continue
onward, then I say, I am in!

180
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:42,385
<i>There are lot of times in life when
you just have to take control.</i>

181
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:45,794
Hey, give me those keys...I'm driving.

182
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:50,564
Next stop...Kim tell.

183
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,069
<i>Of course, sometimes control
is taken away from you.</i>

184
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:57,088
You have to operate on my baby

185
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:00,282
- while it's still in the womb?
- Well, there's a urinary tract obstruction

186
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:03,509
which ould be blocking the amniotic
fluid. We need to place a shunt.

187
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:05,695
I gotta talk to Jordan.

188
00:12:07,463 --> 00:12:10,521
*  "Guy Love" ringtone *

189
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,632
- Mickhead! Giveme my phone.
- It's mine.

190
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,373
Oh, really? Does yours have a
picture of Carla in the background?

191
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:20,293
Ha! Trick question! Mine's
got Tyra Banks, see?!

192
00:12:23,246 --> 00:12:26,811
- Shello?
- Baby? I got Turk.

193
00:12:28,308 --> 00:12:31,095
And sometimes, just not as a
control as you think you are.

194
00:12:31,736 --> 00:12:35,321
Aah...that tunnel looks kinda small.

195
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,814
Chill out, Ted.

196
00:12:38,853 --> 00:12:41,494
<i>Why would they build a tunnel
that a RV wouldn't fit?</i>

197
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:49,365
<i>Admittedly, the tunnel was more narrow than
I thought, but the damage wasn't too bad.</i>

198
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:53,605
<i>Keith just had to stop accidentally making</i>

199
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,217
<i>the "please-hunk-your-horn"
signs to passing truckers.</i>

200
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,176
- What, for God's steak?!
- I was stretching!

201
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:04,688
Four aces, I win!

202
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:10,788
I only got a six of clubs...i win.
- Ok, babe, bye.

203
00:13:12,812 --> 00:13:14,511
There's a problem with Jordan's ultrasound.

204
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,731
This is our best chance to
restore normal function

205
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:21,869
- and then minimize the damage to the lungs.
- Fine, but I wanna be in there.

206
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:23,954
You know we can't allow
family members in the OR.

207
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:30,094
- You gotta be in there for me.
- Don't you see I got a baby

208
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:31,494
- grabbed to my chest?
- Fine.

209
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:37,807
- Now can you?
- First off, I'm not a neonatal surgeon.

210
00:13:37,928 --> 00:13:41,309
Second, you ruined my road trip, and
you just gave my baby to Rochelle.

211
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:44,989
The only nurse to get kicked out of a nursery
for using a baby as a ventriloquist dummy

212
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:49,645
- I don't buy things paint.
- That's because you haven't found someone

213
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:50,894
who's doing it right!

214
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:54,062
Give me that!

215
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,371
What's the matter with you?

216
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,828
Gandhi! You'd damn sure want
somebody in there, if it was your kid.

217
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:09,163
Come on, just do it!

218
00:14:09,505 --> 00:14:11,038
Knock it off, Rochelle.

219
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:14,485
Hey guys, there's the hospital.

220
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,881
Keith, wake up sweetie, we're here.

221
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:19,569
Yes!

222
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:23,887
I haven't seen a truck!

223
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:27,878
Well, how are you going to get home?

224
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:30,912
I don't know, I'll rent a car or something.
Go to care Dr. Cox.

225
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:34,133
Tell him Gladis is
thinking of him.

226
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:35,591
He knows it's me.

227
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:37,430
Good luck.

228
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:44,552
Farewell, stranger. I shall toast
you with my hearties ?white?.

229
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:47,139
Maybe he should lie down.

230
00:14:56,878 --> 00:15:00,979
Turkleton, if I let you assist
on that surgery,

231
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,416
I would be breaking
every hospital protocol.

232
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:08,196
And you know damn well that
I would never be that inappropriate.

233
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:09,802
Oh, thanks Sugar Boobs.

234
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:13,475
Lucky for you, I
am a man in need.

235
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:17,387
Enid asked me to get her tickets
to see Al Green, for birthday.

236
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,851
I forgot, now they're sold out.

237
00:15:20,114 --> 00:15:21,326
Can you call him for me?

238
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,370
Sir? Do you think I know Al
Green just because I'm black?

239
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,938
Plan B. Also lucky for you.

240
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:35,635
Inid has gone blind from glaucoma.

241
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:39,029
- Now... - Oh...
- Here's what I need.

242
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:42,060
<i>In life, it's never easy to
know what's waiting for you,</i>

243
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:43,713
<i>on the other side of that door.</i>

244
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,632
Surprise!

245
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,231
Oh my God, J.D.!

246
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:55,715
Come with me for a second,
it's a game.

247
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:07,157
- Everything is gonna be OK.
- I know.

248
00:16:07,252 --> 00:16:11,181
Jordan? I love you.

249
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:15,676
<i>Sometimes you find the moment
that knocks you on your ass.</i>

250
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:17,502
How's our baby doing, eh?

251
00:16:18,654 --> 00:16:20,504
J.D., I had a miscarriage.

252
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:26,505
<i>Other times, it just takes
your breath away.</i>

253
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,212
Wow!

254
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:35,689
Hey! So everything went great.

255
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:37,719
Yeah, Jordan and the baby are fine.

256
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:40,734
Fair enough.

257
00:16:41,472 --> 00:16:42,783
That? That's it?

258
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:43,848
Yep.

259
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,046
Ok, I don't know about you but
when I get great news,

260
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:48,527
I like to show some form of emotion.

261
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,099
Like when I graduate at Med School.

262
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:53,834
I went all Billie Ocean dance
and all over like "Hmmm".

263
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,376
And then, when Izzy was born,
tried the wedge armswing.

264
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:05,508
Look, you know as
well as I do,

265
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,487
that no kids who had surgery
before it's even born,

266
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:13,214
is just gonna pop out into the world
without any... without any problems.

267
00:17:14,662 --> 00:17:16,560
In 3 months it's gonna
have grown that shunt...

268
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:18,511
and we're gonna have to go through
this all thing all over again,

269
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,109
so you're gonna have to
excuse me if I'm...

270
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,976
not celebrating.

271
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:25,072
The baby's gonna be fine.

272
00:17:25,262 --> 00:17:27,199
And just how can you
be so sure of that?

273
00:17:27,475 --> 00:17:30,743
Because that little thing
grabbed my finger so tight,

274
00:17:30,744 --> 00:17:32,303
and wouldn't let go.

275
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:35,928
Perry. She's strong.

276
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,153
She?

277
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:43,748
Yeah, daddy.

278
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:46,954
I should have told
you earlier.

279
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:48,765
I, just, I didn't wanna do
that on the phone, and...

280
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:50,874
You OK?

281
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:53,997
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

282
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:57,992
It's kinda weird,
there was this... thing.

283
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,001
That I never met.

284
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:03,033
And now it's gone,
I kinda miss it.

285
00:18:03,761 --> 00:18:04,611
I know.

286
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:07,731
When I was hurrying,

287
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,620
looking for to do all those parent
things you hear about, you know

288
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:16,205
like... changing diapers,
first steps, play and catch.

289
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:19,890
Turk was getting even, teach me
how to throw like a guy, so...

290
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:23,124
?Last time it was a girl, who I saw
that can throw like yourself.?

291
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,304
Can I ask you something?

292
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,754
Were we just staying together
'cause we were having a kid?

293
00:18:31,148 --> 00:18:34,060
No. No, come on.

294
00:18:34,824 --> 00:18:38,072
Come back for me and see in a couple of month
we're gonna pick right where we left off.

295
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:41,349
I mean, I guess it'll be a
little more casual.

296
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:45,479
We probably shouldn't talk there was,
we're wearing full body condoms.

297
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:50,676
What if I wasn't coming back because
they offered me a permanent position here?

298
00:18:52,955 --> 00:18:53,734
Do they?

299
00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:55,756
Yeah.

300
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:05,158
<i>We said the almighty talk
might lead to everything,</i>

301
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,169
<i>how we felt about
each other,</i>

302
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,809
<i>what that we
wanted since this relationship,</i>

303
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,118
<i>whether she would ever see
herself come back to Sacred Heart,</i>

304
00:19:12,272 --> 00:19:15,337
<i>wait a pizza place to deliver to
avenge at 3 in the morning.</i>

305
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:17,563
<i>They would.</i>

306
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:19,184
<i>And, at the end of it all,</i>

307
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,987
<i>we both realized that without
a baby in the picture,</i>

308
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:23,846
<i>the best thing to do
was to say goodbye.</i>

309
00:19:24,492 --> 00:19:27,430
<i>Stay friends and hope that
our paths cross again.</i>

310
00:19:27,431 --> 00:19:28,890
<i>Someday.</i>

311
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:34,633
So then I took a 900$
cab ride home,

312
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:36,709
and voila', here I am.

313
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,605
Oh, J.D., that sucks.
I'm so sorry.

314
00:19:39,606 --> 00:19:40,938
Bummer!

315
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,922
Now why am I back in here again?

316
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:46,299
Cause I couldn't wait to rub a
little jelly on your treaty trail.

317
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:50,011
No, I have to see if your
kidney stones has dissolved yet.

318
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:55,116
- J.D.!
- Ahah!

319
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:56,471
I always do that.

320
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:56,687
So do I.

321
00:19:56,716 --> 00:19:58,819
<i>There really are two
kinds of surprises:</i>

322
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,438
<i>the good ones, that
makes everything OK,</i>

323
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:04,514
It's a girl.

324
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:07,785
We're having a baby girl!

325
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:11,533
<i>And the bad ones,
that makes you mad.</i>

326
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:14,553
That's Poppa's
Pleasure Palace.

327
00:20:14,653 --> 00:20:15,853
