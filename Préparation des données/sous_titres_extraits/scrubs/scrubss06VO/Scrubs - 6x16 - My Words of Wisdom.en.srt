1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,132
<i>Today was Laverne's funeral.</i>

2
00:00:04,511 --> 00:00:08,051
<i>But Dr. Cox was having more trouble
adjusting to his new baby's name.</i>

3
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:10,481
What's wrong with Jennifer Dylan?

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,243
You named our daughter...

5
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:14,051
...JD!

6
00:00:14,924 --> 00:00:17,749
It's a beautiful morning!

7
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:19,253
JD!!!

8
00:00:20,423 --> 00:00:22,078
Sorry, I was thinking about something else.

9
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,732
Why would you do such a thing?

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,564
I was hoping that you would have hated
the name so much that you wouldn't

11
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:31,451
be able to hide your spite for your daughter,
and she would love me more than you.

12
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:32,916
I gotta go.

13
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:35,654
Don't forget! Mum is coming home tomorrow,

14
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:38,878
so the fridge needs to be restocked
with rice cakes and vodka.

15
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:42,152
Jordan, while you were on bedrest
for the last two months

16
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:45,268
I served as
mother-father-butler-breadwinner and

17
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:49,204
thanks to our son's pinching for
eating nickles and your irrational fear

18
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:53,256
that they'd never get past
through his system...poopoo-sifter.

19
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:55,984
I was hoping that
upon your return you would start

20
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:58,724
to assume some domestic responsabilities?

21
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:00,304
Pass!

22
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:08,893
* Amazing Grace *

23
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:12,007
how sweet

24
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:15,053
the sound

25
00:01:15,364 --> 00:01:17,521
that says...

26
00:01:17,552 --> 00:01:21,045
<i>The music was so perfect that
for a moment it made us all happy. </i>

27
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:22,243
<i>Well, most of us.</i>

28
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:24,730
I told you why they sang that good, Roy,

29
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:26,902
because they shove for practice.

30
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:29,682
<i>Everyone reacts differently at funerals.</i>

31
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,280
<i>Some people wear
their emotions on their sleeves.</i>

32
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:36,707
<i>Others are more stuck.</i>

33
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:41,921
<i>And there's always that one guy
who's completely inappropriate.</i>

34
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:45,395
- I did her autopsy.
- I'm her uncle.

35
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:48,677
Your niece had beautiful guts.

36
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:51,540
Nice save, chief.

37
00:01:52,702 --> 00:01:54,419
<i>As for me, I couldn't help but imagine</i>

38
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:56,257
<i>what my own funeral would be like.</i>

39
00:01:56,258 --> 00:01:57,235
* ...ing grace *

40
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:58,730
* Michael wants *

41
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:00,378
* to party all the time! *

42
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:03,448
* Party all the time*

43
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:05,940
Yeah! And as you know JD

44
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:09,677
only had two requests.
And that is that the choir

45
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:13,611
sing the song that would remind us
of how much he loved the party

46
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:17,530
and that he can get
one last hug from each of you.

47
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:24,138
You are the only one I've never faked it with.

48
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,758
It's true.

49
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:30,677
Hell, I... I love you noobie.

50
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,788
I should have done this long time ago.

51
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:36,797
I knew you loved me.

52
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:39,912
I just had to fake my own death
to prove it. He loves me everyone.

53
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:41,264
Can I get an Amen?

54
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,059
- Amen!
- God is good!

55
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:45,961
Worth it.

56
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:50,644
And then we'd have my real funeral.

57
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:54,000
- Are you an idiot?
- No, sir. I'm a dreamer.

64
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,115
Brothers and sisters, as we leave here today

65
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:14,363
let's not mourne on Laverne's passing, Amen?

66
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:15,525
Amen!

67
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:18,229
Let us celebrate her life.
Isn't that what she wants us to do?

68
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:19,855
Mmh mmh.

69
00:03:20,386 --> 00:03:22,908
That's where she got that!

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,232
Let us live like she lived.

71
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:27,617
And don't be afraid to open your heart

72
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:30,062
to those that are dear to you, Amen?

73
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:31,763
Amen.

74
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:34,444
And always make sure that you put yourself

75
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,285
in other people shoes before you
judge them, is that all right?

76
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:38,553
Yeah, that's right.

77
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:41,120
And no matter how busy life gets

78
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:44,500
I want you to take 20 minutes
everyday for yourself

79
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,189
so  you can reflect on who you are

80
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:49,953
- as one of God's children, Amen?
- Amen.

81
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:52,870
I love you and there's absolutely
nothing you can do about it.

82
00:03:53,052 --> 00:03:53,948
Thank you for coming.

83
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:59,687
Amazing Grace....

84
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:02,573
<i>It was weird because even though
we were all caught up in that moment</i>

85
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:05,778
<i>once we got to work we fell
right back in our routines.</i>

86
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:07,730
Turk, she's back.

87
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:10,768
Oh, my God. Tammy Two Toes.

88
00:04:11,186 --> 00:04:13,997
So that's it? One second
we're mourning Laverne

89
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:16,077
and the next you're
making up ridiculous nicknames?

90
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:18,750
Babe, how am I supposed to call her?
Her name is Tammy

91
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:21,089
- and she's got two toes!
- I hate this.

92
00:04:21,682 --> 00:04:24,187
Everybody is moving on
as if Laverne was never even here.

93
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:25,753
Babe?

94
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,472
It's like her feet are giving me the P sign.

95
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:30,843
<i>What Carla didn't know was that some people</i>

96
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:33,211
<i>were already taking
Laverne's life lessons to heart.</i>

97
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:34,730
Perry, can I ask you a favour?

98
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:36,993
Actually, Bob, out of respect for Laverne, no!

99
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:40,221
You see, according to
the Right Reverend Jimmy T. Given,

100
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,467
that's the name I gave the minister in my mind,

101
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,674
every day, Bob, every day I am to take

102
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:47,770
20 minutes for myself.

103
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:51,989
Right about now I'm going
to be entering my imaginary

104
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,221
soundproof glass bubble.

105
00:04:54,932 --> 00:04:56,822
Don't worry, I don't have to be BO--

106
00:04:56,823 --> 00:05:00,409
* Cox moves his mouth
without really speaking *

107
00:05:00,613 --> 00:05:04,077
I was just going to ask you
to keep your yapper shot

108
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:06,993
while I read the papers, so everybody wins.

109
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:08,869
- Dr. Cox.
- You might wanna knock,

110
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,950
he's in an imaginary glass bubble.

111
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,057
- What?
- I need help with a patient.

112
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:16,938
20 minutes.

113
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:20,538
Hey, how long does it take
for an old woman to bleed to death?

114
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:27,321
<i>I still had the post funeral blues</i>

115
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:30,845
<i>so I pulled up my secret weapon to bribe
Turk into hanging out with me.</i>

116
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:32,819
I'm gonna get that sour ball today, right?

117
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,280
If I give up right away you won't respect me.

118
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:37,604
Hello, Mr. Francis,

119
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:40,004
when did your son start having stomach pains?

120
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:43,422
Oh, I'm sorry. You're deaf, it's ok.

121
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:45,670
It's all right, will you help me
to communicate with your dad?

122
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:50,303
Oh, you are deaf too, what are the odds?

123
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,467
I'm a doctor, I should probably know that.

124
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:55,323
Yeah, I'll just write the questions down.
Give me a pen.

125
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:57,207
I don't have a pen, my pockets are empty.

126
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:58,726
Except for the sour ball.

127
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:01,748
Turk, there never was a sour ball.

128
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:05,227
I knew that, I... just  didn't
wanna believe it.

129
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,736
My lip reading really is horrible,
because they couldn't be talking

130
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:12,131
about sour balls while there
is a sick child in the room.

131
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:16,088
Dr. Cox.

132
00:06:16,194 --> 00:06:19,300
- Do you know sign language?
- I know just one sign.

133
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:25,832
It means leave me alone
for 20 minutes or die painfully.

134
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,136
- Dr.Cox...
- Oohh...

135
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,519
We can't play such S to you but Mr.
Carneen is crashing..

136
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,738
For the love of God!

137
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:34,727
Dr. Kelso, do you know signs language?

138
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:40,735
Is that a really commonly used sign?

139
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,717
I'm calling it personal, there's gotta
be someone in this hospital

140
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,274
who does signs language.

141
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,524
- Doctors..
- Get outta here!

142
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:50,867
- Yeah, get outta here.
- You don't know sign--

143
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:03,292
Elliott... I know I'm
supposed to be sad, a few,

144
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:07,446
but  what I could think about was
how lucky I am to have you in my life.

145
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:08,282
You know?

146
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:12,717
I'm sorry, I'm just not really
in the mood for relationshiply talk.

147
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:14,889
Yeah, sure.

148
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:18,459
And don't you dare move that tie!

149
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,629
Let me guess.

150
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,302
You wanna do some crazy sexual roleplaying.

151
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:25,834
No... I just... never get the
chance to see you in a suit,

152
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:26,563
that's all.

153
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:28,309
- Do you?
- Fine.

154
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,753
I'm a chiller trashy popstar who rarely
wears underwear,

155
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:33,717
and you're one of my backup dancers who's
not quite sure about his sexuality, yet.

156
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:36,694
No, I don't wanna do
Britney and K-Fed anymore.

157
00:07:37,271 --> 00:07:39,337
Since the divorce is too sad.

158
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:44,813
Ok... you're... one of XXX
top defense attorneys,

159
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:47,209
and I've just hired you
because I killed my husband

160
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,406
in an argument over my
addiction to painkillers.

161
00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:51,527
Got it.

162
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:57,649
His medical records are in Michigan,
with his mom.

163
00:07:58,006 --> 00:07:59,464
He's only with me for a week.

164
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,884
Ok, tell him we wanna run some tests
and we'll be back once we get the results.

165
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,076
How do you know sign language?

166
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:11,996
Well, when I was in high school
I was a volounteer janitor,

167
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:13,370
with the whole booking zoo.

168
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:17,069
Then one night I was out plucking
peackocks feathers to sell for pens,

169
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,636
when I noticed Gary the gorilla
making the sign for food.

170
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,336
I gave him my danish, he gave
the sign for "thank you".

171
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:24,038
Was the only two sings that Gary

172
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:26,874
Except for boobs. He
liked them big and hairy.

173
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:28,146
- Join the club, player.

174
00:08:28,672 --> 00:08:30,079
- Get away.
- Ok.

175
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:33,631
So, eventually Gary, I'm sorry to say,
died of a lung cancer,

176
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:36,743
for that I blame myself because I used
to share my smokes with him.

177
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,311
But he also picked my interest in signing,

178
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:41,745
and in his memory I took my
first signing class.

179
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:44,375
Is any of that true?

180
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:46,259
Someone have to read it back to me.

181
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:50,463
Oh, what's up your caboodle?

182
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:51,848
Caboodle?

183
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,408
Oh, it's a new word I'm trying out
to replace "ass".

184
00:08:54,443 --> 00:08:57,179
I have loose morals, and
I'm living in sin, so..

185
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,901
still hoping that not being a potty mouth
will to get me into heaven.

186
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:02,742
Well, I was just thinking it would
be nice if people at least

187
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:05,196
acted like they missed Laverne, you know?

188
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:08,131
Elliot. Look...

189
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:11,278
I know this weekend is our one
year anniversary, but

190
00:09:11,313 --> 00:09:14,613
my college buddy Donnie is in Vegas
and he wants me to fly out.

191
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:18,323
- Cool, yeah.
- Alright.

192
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,218
Were you for real?

193
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,284
That's a trick, right?!

194
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:25,908
I mean, when he comes back from Vegas
you're gonna tear him a new one.

195
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:27,288
No.

196
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:31,216
With Keith, I've decided I'm gonna be
the best girlfriend ever.

197
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,659
If that means skipping some silly
anniversary, that's fine!

198
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:37,357
If that means, having some crazy sex
and then running off

199
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:39,599
with that cuddling to go meet
the fellows for a beer, great!

200
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:40,920
I might cry.

201
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:44,613
Man, if you were just 40 years older...

202
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:49,304
Hey, check this out.

203
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:52,861
Not only's our deaf kid a mild
case of gastroenterites,

204
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:54,722
this fax means medical history.

205
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:56,448
His condition is congenital,

206
00:09:56,569 --> 00:09:58,674
they tried to hear in gain
but no results, I think

207
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:01,022
he's a perfect candidate for
coclear implant!

208
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:03,886
- I think we could make this kid hear!
- Dude, that's amazing.

209
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:05,403
Can you teach me how to sign

210
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:07,294
"I think we can fix your son's hearing?"

211
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:08,631
Or I can just tell him.

212
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:10,439
I think it's best if he hears from a doctor.

213
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:12,262
No, you just want the glory.

214
00:10:12,497 --> 00:10:14,624
Are you really that emotionally needy?

215
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,625
- Have we not met?
- Ah, you're right.

216
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:17,630
I'm sorry... wasn't thinking.

217
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:21,474
Look...why don't we we go in there
and split the glory three ways, ok?

218
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,084
Let's go. The three doctors!

219
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:26,206
<i>Nothing is ever easy around here.</i>

220
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:28,424
<i>Whether it's something
as simple as trying to find</i>

221
00:10:28,454 --> 00:10:29,912
<i>20 minutes for yourself.</i>

222
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:34,279
Doctor Cox, can we go somewhere
and talk about Laverne for a while?

223
00:10:35,183 --> 00:10:37,173
That sounds like exactly...

224
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:39,079
what I wanna do.

225
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:41,975
<i>Or something as big as finding out</i>

226
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:44,079
<i>your relationship isn't going
as well as you thought.</i>

227
00:10:44,137 --> 00:10:45,808
Hey Keith, pass me a fake sugar.

228
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:48,482
Elliot, this relationship
isn't working for me.

229
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,135
Oh, that sucks caboodle.

230
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:56,472
<i>Still none of that matters when you've
got to change someone's life forever.</i>

231
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:10,188
- What d'he say?
- He said no thank you.

232
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,742
<i>No father would deny a son
the chance to hear,</i>

233
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,727
<i>so we knew it had to be
a misunderstanding.</i>

234
00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:21,918
<i>We told the Janitor
to clear things up.</i>

235
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:23,695
You know, if we learned sign language

236
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:26,414
we could talk in the movies
without Carla yelling at us .

237
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:28,736
But it's so dark, how can
we see we were signing?

238
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:31,106
We'd get special glow-in-the-dark
signing gloves.

239
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,888
Yeah, but then the popcorn butter
will get all over the gloves.

240
00:11:33,913 --> 00:11:36,525
Why do you keep poking holes
in this? We'd cut off the fingertips!

241
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:37,771
Okay, I'm in.

242
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:42,486
Well, I told him everything you said,

243
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:45,706
his kid's the perfect age for the
procedure, his insurance will cover it,

244
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:46,890
and he's still not interested.

245
00:11:48,704 --> 00:11:50,633
Elliot, I don't have
a friend in Vegas, okay?

246
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:54,521
Thet was a test to see if you
even care about our anniversary.

247
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,591
Obviously you don't!

248
00:11:55,804 --> 00:11:57,900
Why are you trying
to mess up a good thing?

249
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,367
Oh, so now my feelings don't count?

250
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:01,385
Look, I...

251
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:06,882
Sir, can I help you here?

252
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,477
Oh, you already are, sweetheart.

253
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:10,974
I forgot to bring my papers
down here but this...

254
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:13,420
gabfest is just delicious.

255
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:16,404
So, go on! You were talking
about your relationship,

256
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:19,821
only it was like: he's the chick
and you're the dude!

257
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,443
- What do you think about the sex?
- Ah, here we go nag, nag, nag.

258
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,523
Ah! You nagger!

259
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:28,075
- What d'you just call him, you punk ass?
- A nagger.

260
00:12:28,651 --> 00:12:29,593
Okay, we're cool!

261
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,892
Elliot, you're always
talking to everyone else

262
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:35,961
about marriage and having babies,

263
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:37,924
but you've never seriously
talked about it with me!

264
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:42,281
I love you, okay? You know
you've never said that to me before?

265
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:44,224
And that's fine, I can wait.

266
00:12:45,226 --> 00:12:48,006
But if we're not moving
toward something...I need to know!

267
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:51,339
So are you gonna say anything?

268
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:57,338
- I really don't know what I'd say.
- And then forget it.

269
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,677
Bitches, uh? What are you gonna do?

270
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:08,469
Okay. What's the problem?

271
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:10,908
Laverne was our friend and people

272
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:14,149
are walking around like she never
existed. It's not right, you know?

273
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:15,857
Yeah. Tough crap.

274
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,186
Excuse me?

275
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:20,709
You can't tell other people
how to feel, you just can't.

276
00:13:21,172 --> 00:13:22,888
Some wanna cry, that's fine.

277
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:26,061
Others may choose to laugh and,
guess what, that's okay too!

278
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:29,555
But you don't know what's going on
inside people's heads, take, ehm...

279
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:32,267
take pee-pants here.

280
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:35,781
Now, how do you know he's not
thinking about Laverne, right now?

281
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:37,787
I am thinking about her.

282
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:40,876
I haven't seen my cellphone
since her autopsy.

283
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,191
- You don't think if I call it...
- You're done.

284
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,426
So, to sum up...

285
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:48,060
Tough crap.

286
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,685
Hope that helps.

287
00:13:51,545 --> 00:13:52,240
People...

288
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,000
Before I disappear for 20 minutes,

289
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,137
I wanna make sure all my patients are alive. They simply still here

290
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:00,428
will see if I sound of
like " You got it , Per!"

291
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:01,855
* Crowd answers Dr. Cox *

292
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:06,803
Ted, we know denying surgery
is technically child abuse,

293
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,794
we were just wondering
if you have some legal recourse.

294
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:12,034
Just give me one... second.

295
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,644
Are you looking for a legal precedent?

296
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:17,733
No, I'm looking for word "recourse".

297
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,450
- Dr. Cox!
- What?!

298
00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:24,645
- What now? What somebody needs now?
- Our deaf patient's father

299
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:27,235
won't sign a consent form so he
can have a coclear implant.

300
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:31,669
Hmm... who could you possibily go
if the father won't sign?

301
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,457
Here's a hint. It begins with
an "m", and ends with an "r".

302
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:37,997
Marg Hengelberger!

303
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:41,386
The mother! Get the mother
to sign it! The mother will sign it!

304
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:43,584
- The mother! I told you! You were--
- The mother! Come on, man...

305
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:45,959
Well, it's not Marg, we do not end well.

306
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,870
Hell, there's no theory
like a Hengelberger scorns.

307
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:53,151
Scorn... After "r"...

308
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,011
So Keith's being on your
case not getting serious?

309
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:02,889
Totally. Plus he wants me to be all like
"open and honest" about how I feel.

310
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:05,677
I mean, do you girls talk like that
in a new relationship?

311
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:08,015
I tell Turk I love him all the time.

312
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,682
I wish I told Laverne more.

313
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:11,978
Downer!

314
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:14,325
I haven't seen you in a while.

315
00:15:14,438 --> 00:15:16,006
Oh, she just had a baby.

316
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,574
Well, then how can you be drinking?
Aren't you breastfeeding?

317
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:22,363
I haven't decided. Were you breastfed?

318
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,081
Huh, of course I was.

319
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:26,626
That is so interesting!

320
00:15:26,748 --> 00:15:31,180
Cause you're a sluggy buttinsky who
ended up becoming a waitress for her living.

321
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,570
Maybe breastfeeding isn't the answer.

322
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,626
This is the greatest night ever!

323
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:41,168
You know what? I mean, if I really
had deep feelings for Keith,

324
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:42,530
i would have told him by now.

325
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:46,509
- Maybe it is time to move on.
- Oh, that's a bunch of crap.

326
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:50,509
- Excuse me?!
- You're a chicken.

327
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,349
In the last six years I've seen you
get really close to one guy,

328
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,631
and that was JD, and he crushed you.

329
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,372
Ever since then, you've been
so scared of getting hurt

330
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:01,933
I've seen you sabotage every
relationship you've been in.

331
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,836
Honestly, you must be crazy about Keith
to let him have survived this long,

332
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:08,390
but don't worry, you'll be
alone again, soon enough.

333
00:16:09,658 --> 00:16:12,446
You know, Carla, sometimes you
can be a real caboodle-hole.

334
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:21,562
Oh, now Bob, what the hell,

335
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,999
have you just being sitting on your
prony keester all day reading the paper?

336
00:16:25,196 --> 00:16:29,243
Heavens, no... I also went downstairs
to get a cup of coffee.

337
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:34,717
Well, it must be nice not having everyone wanna piss ya.

338
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:37,760
If one more person interrupts my me-time,

339
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:39,722
I'm gonna go ahead and
get a tattoo of my hand

340
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:41,346
giving a middle finger,
on the back of my head.

341
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:45,891
Well, why not? It's not as all we can
make you look anymore like a psychopath.

342
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:48,840
Well, whatever it takes to
get them to leave me alone.

343
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:51,111
You love it.

344
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:52,839
How was that?

345
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:55,440
Being everybody's "go-to" guy!

346
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,037
Perry,

347
00:16:57,121 --> 00:17:01,619
people do not do things over and over
unless they get some kind of joy out of it.

348
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,437
I've been watching you for 20 years, champ.

349
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,376
Your joy comes from being needed.

350
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:08,615
That's who you are.

351
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:16,173
He wants to know what's going on.

352
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:20,941
Tell him we're prepairing his son for surgery,
we got the mother's consent.

353
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:24,912
And tell him, if you know
the sign, that is: Booya.

354
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:26,899
Booya!

355
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,077
- Nazi salut.
- Oh, my bad.

356
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:38,463
- Keith.
- What Elliot?

357
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,680
How can I say this... uhm...

358
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:46,298
Look, I once had a dog named Precious, he was
a great dane, and I loved him so much.

359
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:49,584
I mean, even after he dissemballed
that old lady Morgan's cat

360
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:52,470
Seriously, he like slit her right
down the middle and drop an ear

361
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:56,272
and than that, God, it's just flew out
of her like shiny red fireworks.

362
00:17:57,361 --> 00:18:02,444
Precious was such a sweet dog and then...
One day, after the blue, he bit me.

363
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:05,158
And I knew that my dad would
have him put down, so

364
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:07,809
I said that I was bitten
by Mrs. Morgan's bulldog

365
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:12,013
which, ironically enough, she had gotten
to replace the murdered cat, anyway...

366
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:16,484
They came and took the bulldog away
and... I never said a word.

367
00:18:18,323 --> 00:18:21,858
To this day, I wish I'd spoken up
before it was too late.

368
00:18:22,795 --> 00:18:24,476
Do you know what I'm saying?

369
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:26,291
Not even a little.

370
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:33,438
I love you, Keith. I really do.

371
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:36,484
Gotta go, see ya!

372
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,910
Elliot, come here.

373
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:04,249
And here he goes off.
Surgery fists in: Blown up!

374
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:09,580
You know what's weird? He doesn't seem
like a bad dad, he really loves that kid.

375
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:12,790
It must be hard with a divorce,
barely gets to see his son.

376
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:13,841
Would kill me.

377
00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:17,013
Maybe being deaf was the biggest
connection he and his son had.

378
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:20,128
You know, when I was a kid, I made
my dad teach me the sign language

379
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:23,892
so I could communicate with my deaf sister.
I ended up closer with her more than anyone.

380
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,699
Maybe Mr. Francis is afraid of losing that.

381
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:28,841
Is any of that true?

382
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:32,184
Mostly.
My dad died before I was born.

383
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:35,452
- Wait a while! I met your dad!
- You met a man.

384
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:38,605
Guys, we should go in there and talk to him.

385
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:45,159
<i>And like that Carla knew the nurse Roberts
was still on all our heads.</i>

386
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:50,835
<i>Because even if Dr. Cox never took that 20
minutes from himself like the minister said,</i>

387
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:53,700
<i>he still realized who he was
as one of God's children.</i>

388
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,226
Dr. Cox, we're having trouble
placing the central line.

389
00:19:58,105 --> 00:20:00,628
You know what? We'll... handle it.

390
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,908
It's ok, you can go. I won't tell anyone.

391
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:10,382
<i>Elliot had finally opened her heart,</i>

392
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:13,144
<i>even though it made her feel
more vulnerable than ever.</i>

393
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,540
Hey, just so I know, have you seen Keith?

394
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,521
We were supposed to meet here to ride home
togheter, but I can't aim to find him.

395
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:20,235
- Hey, there! Ready to go?
- Yeah!

396
00:20:31,502 --> 00:20:33,972
<i>As for us, even though it took a while,</i>

397
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:37,184
<i>we did finally put ourselves
in someone else's shoes.</i>

398
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:40,585
So you can sign him that we...we know
that it supposed to be hard for him?

399
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:42,296
It suppose to be hard for you.

400
00:20:44,455 --> 00:20:48,143
He knows... will be fine...
He just wants the best for his son.

401
00:20:49,703 --> 00:20:52,397
Thank you for the interpreting...
Hey, no problem! That was for me.

402
00:20:52,493 --> 00:20:53,792
Very impressive.

403
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:56,162
Stop talking, idiot!

404
00:20:56,316 --> 00:20:57,480
