1
00:00:03,074 --> 00:00:04,243
<i>There we were!</i>

2
00:00:04,543 --> 00:00:07,779
<i>Elliot's friend Melody and I,
witnessing this moment;</i>

3
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:11,805
Yes!
Oh my God, yes!

4
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:15,927
Aewsome! Awesome! Uh, okay, uh...

5
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,626
- This is so romantic...
- I don't...

6
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:24,236
Ok, it's a little tight,
just... push a little harder.

7
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:28,034
Uh, brought a little skin there, no problem.

8
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,706
Here come the freaks.

9
00:00:32,263 --> 00:00:36,303
Just put that motherfucking ring on that
motherfrickin' finger! Frick, frick, frick!

10
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:39,176
Honey, it... it needs to be resized.

11
00:00:39,574 --> 00:00:42,898
Ok, Keith, sweetie,
you know how I'm crazy, right?

12
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,002
- Definitively.
- Oh, thanks goodness!

13
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:48,852
Because, I'm so sorry but I just gonna
have to take back my "yes", you see?

14
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:52,657
You have to understand, I have dreamt about
this moment since I was a very little girl

15
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:56,041
and, the ring fit perfectly,
but I swelled up and I said:

16
00:00:56,594 --> 00:01:01,211
"Yes! Oh my God, yes!",
with exactly that inflection.

17
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,041
I'll fix it.

18
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:06,668
Just tell me when you want
me to ask you again.

19
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:09,823
You mean that you'd let me
plan on my own proposal?

20
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,345
Sure.

21
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:13,861
Yes! Sweet!

22
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:17,539
Ok, we've only got two days people.
Melody: you're on decorations.

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,151
Jordan: you come out with my look.

24
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,111
If I think at your appointment, would you
have your armpits botoxed so they don't sweat?

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,549
Because, otherwise, I'm very limited.

26
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:28,708
I'm open to it. Carla: you're
encharged to the guest list.

27
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:31,365
Just make sure that
all of my friends are there.

28
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:33,634
Uh, and nail me that bitch of radiology.

29
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,256
She teased me for six years about
how she's gonna beat me down the aisle.

30
00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:40,430
- Oh, she can suck it, her and her fat neck.
- Invite fat neck, got it.

31
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:44,743
If you'll point out fat neck to me I'll keep
asking why she's still single until she cries.

32
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:46,654
Done.

33
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:50,584
Check it. Not a drop of sweat, it's like
a hundred degrees, in there.

34
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:53,863
We haven't really been introduced.

35
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:55,907
Jordan.
But first smell it.

36
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,285
Hey, sport.

37
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,400
Sorry to hear about your
placing second into Dr. Reid thong.

38
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,295
Sir?

39
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:06,614
Well, you don't have to hide it, son.

40
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:10,450
Given your history, you must be taking
her engagement pretty hard.

41
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:14,465
Sadly, it's only in the movies where
the pretty girl ends up with the ugle.

42
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:17,743
Huh! Can you believe him?

43
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,019
Oh, you and Elliot did go to a lot.

44
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,363
You two have been on and off again
more than Ross and Rachel from Friends.

45
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:26,203
Pffff-lease, I'm nothing like Ross.

46
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:29,606
No, of course not.
You're Rachel, she's Ross.

47
00:02:33,016 --> 00:02:36,877
You guys are crazy. Nobody else in this
ospital thinks that I'm upset about Elliot.

48
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,040
Tough break, man!

49
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:42,503
'tis better to have loved and lost
than to never loved at all, five!

50
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:44,741
I know about lost, brother.

51
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:50,662
It's like she took your heart and just...

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,831
Doug, aren't you supposed to save those?

53
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:54,492
Don't tell anyone.

54
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,980
Okay. I'm gonna head over here to vomit.

61
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,767
Baby? Would you do me a favour at night
that requires no effort on your part?

62
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:19,195
Sure, what is it?

63
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:20,683
Would you have sex with me?

64
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,723
Come on! We haven't had
a lacing since Izzy was born.

65
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,010
Turk, I'm just not there yet.

66
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,801
I mean, if you weren't emotionally ready
would you wanna have sex.

67
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:33,085
Baby, I don't even understand the question.

68
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:34,134
Go away.

69
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:36,517
Oh, man!

70
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:39,940
Mrs Shelton is the sweetest old lady
but I can't figure out what's wrong with her.

71
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:43,787
She's got a muse of random symptoms:
myalgia, alopecia, rash...

72
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:48,638
That is so weird. My patient,
Mr. Billbray, has the same exact symptoms.

73
00:03:48,697 --> 00:03:50,419
Actually, he's my patient.

74
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,568
Jamie? You're a baby intern.

75
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:55,513
Yesterday you asked me how to turn on your
stethoscope. Now go stand over there.

76
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,498
Sorry, but this patients have something
in common, someplace they've been, or eaten.

77
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:01,847
Let's go check it out.

78
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,243
Can you immagine being married to Elliot?

79
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:13,860
Darling, do you think we're pidging
the hole into thechilden?

80
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:19,561
Who cares? It's not like they're ours.

81
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:23,421
I'd have to find some tiny
charts and mops, but it's doable.

82
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:24,929
I'll tell you what you doable:

83
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:28,551
Dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dogn, doooong!

84
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:29,307
Very clever.

85
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:31,670
God is watching. How many times
have you got laid this year?

86
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:33,340
Bagel.

87
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,855
Who'd have thought "God is
watching" would work. Hmm.

88
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:43,587
Keith and I are definitively having some post
engagement nookie tomorrow night after the proposal,

89
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:45,192
Did you get me those purple ACIDs?

90
00:04:45,272 --> 00:04:47,510
Yes, Keith is gonna look so hot.

91
00:04:47,703 --> 00:04:49,347
Cool ya. Ok, I'm gonna go meet Carla.

92
00:04:51,714 --> 00:04:53,945
Well, it's official.

93
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:57,620
I'm the only single sorority sister left.

94
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:01,246
I guess it's true what they say.
The first one to be in a threesome,

95
00:05:01,294 --> 00:05:02,402
the last one to get married.

96
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:03,959
Damn.

97
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,264
I'm sorry, she just said that
she was in a threesome.

98
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:10,522
- Damn!
- Damn!

99
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:11,361
Damn!

100
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:12,535
<i>Damn!</i>

101
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:16,445
I just don't wanna end up like
my aunt Sheyla and get married and have a kid when I'm 50.

102
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:19,248
I mean, you find a tooth in that house,
you don't know whose mouth it fell out of.

103
00:05:19,412 --> 00:05:19,994
Ooh.

104
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:24,833
Sometimes, I wonder, you know, if I'm ever
actually gonna find someone.

105
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,927
- You know?
- Yeah.

106
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:31,484
Ok, now is it 2 girls and a guy,
or a devil's threesome?

107
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:33,763
- All girl.
- Uuh.

108
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:36,490
- Damn! Sorry.
- I've got to take off.

109
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,454
Hey, I'm reviewing this new hotel
downtown tonight for work,

110
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:42,252
do you wanna join? It's all commed.

111
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:45,895
- I think I'll pass.
- Well, could have been fun.

112
00:05:46,692 --> 00:05:48,830
<i>{\an8}* Crowd is mad at JD*</i>

113
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,108
- That guy is so moron!
- Ok!

114
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:51,094
Guys! Guys! Guys!

115
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,006
I'm sure he has an explanation, go sit down.

116
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:59,286
I'm not gonna get anywhere with her, she's
got this weird posy, she'll mack with anyone.

117
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,997
But the second you try and take it
further, she throws all the brakes on.

118
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,052
It always ends the same way.

119
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:09,789
<i>Great Aunt Judy's arm fat.
Great Aunt Judy's arm fat.</i>

120
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:14,121
I'm tired of the cold showers.

121
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:17,989
That was yesterday, when she was
just a confident young hotel reviewer.

122
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:22,706
Today she's a sad, vulnerable,
last single-woman standing.

123
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:25,180
Now you're gonna create a wonderful
memory, then secretly call me

124
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:26,710
from the bathroom right after or not?

125
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:31,002
Turk, you know I'd like to be the one
making "The secret bathroom call" for once.

126
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:32,816
But I'm not that desperate.

127
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:38,528
You ordered some "Dorian"?

128
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:40,599
- Huh?
- Oh, that's my last name.

129
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:43,350
Aah, it's a good one!

130
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:45,517
- I thought about it all the way up.
- Come on in.

131
00:06:46,423 --> 00:06:47,836
<i>Oh, it's on.</i>

132
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:52,120
Mrs. Sheldon, may I just say I hope

133
00:06:52,152 --> 00:06:54,078
to look as good as you when I'm 80.

134
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:55,554
I'm 68.

135
00:06:56,236 --> 00:06:58,499
Did they not have some screen
where you grow up?

136
00:06:58,563 --> 00:07:03,530
So, to rap this up, uh, you two live
in different nursing homes,

137
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:05,552
and you have nothing in common.

138
00:07:05,648 --> 00:07:08,858
Is there anything that you can tell us,
that will help us figure out

139
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,788
what's wrong with you?

140
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:12,307
Last week I got a new pair of shoes.

141
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:16,464
That's very helpful, thank you. Now
we just go run some more tests then.

142
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:21,702
Hey, so I convinced the bar-tender to give us

143
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:23,709
all the booze of your party for half price.

144
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:26,790
Little hitch, you're gonna have to
show some boob.

145
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:29,133
Apparently mine did not
get us all the way there.

146
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:30,938
He has a soft touch, though.

147
00:07:31,773 --> 00:07:32,574
Lovely.

148
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:35,318
Oh, and Per, you were wrong.

149
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,292
Someone is dumb enough to love me.

150
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:41,697
Where is your head right now?

151
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:49,569
Perry! No, it goes "Cracker, apple,
cheese".

152
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,157
Not "Cracker, cheese, apple".

153
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:54,639
I know that we're going to be married
today, Perry, but you should know this.

154
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:03,417
You're gonna fry for this, buddy.

155
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:08,207
Worth it.

156
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:10,333
<i>Ok, you made it to the room.</i>

157
00:08:10,638 --> 00:08:14,105
<i>Time for the "John Dorian
3-step seduction plan".</i>

158
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,402
<i>Step 1, make her realize you share
things in common.</i>

159
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,875
Ooh, they have tampons
in the toiletery basket.

160
00:08:20,923 --> 00:08:23,155
- I love that.
- Me too.

161
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:24,695
<i>Step 1, check.</i>

162
00:08:24,855 --> 00:08:27,776
<i>Step 2, connect with her on
a personal level.</i>

163
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:30,376
So, Melody, where's home for you?

164
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:34,331
Originally Akon, Ohio. But home is
where your hat is,

165
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:36,706
that's something my dad used
to always say.

166
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,526
Oh, grace, he would also say that
America is a planet.

167
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:46,166
Ah, he was in a... a boating accident
and suffered some brain damage.

168
00:08:46,638 --> 00:08:51,694
- Brain damage is, uhm... is rarely good.
- Tore our family apart.

169
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:56,059
<i>Step Two: Check. Now just remind her
she's all alone.</i>

170
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,364
Elliot getting married. Crazy, right?

171
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:02,221
I can't believe no one's ever got
down on one knee for you.

172
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:05,142
I know! Cute as a button? Huh!?

173
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,834
- Yeah, you are.
- Hey,

174
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:11,103
I have to check out the linens.
Would you care to test them out with me?

175
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:15,773
<i>And there it is. I could only imagine
what wonderful place</i>

176
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,891
<i>was waiting beneath those covers.</i>

177
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:26,364
Greetings, strange traveller.
Wilst thou make with me tonight?

178
00:09:27,286 --> 00:09:30,749
Allright! Not really sure
how it'd go about doing that,

179
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,766
I mean, where would I put my...

180
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:38,552
C'mon dong! This is a desperate mermaid!

181
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:40,381
You got to hit that!

182
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:44,497
Show me where to go Turk and
I'd be happy to, where is the frontdoor?

183
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:48,212
- Yeah! That's a gill.
- Yeah, it is.

184
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:52,673
- Bring those horns down here!
- Oh, they're coming baby.

185
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:54,262
- You can handle them?
- Oh, I can handle them!

186
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,995
- Oh yeah, you can.
- Hey! Go Turk!

187
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:59,075
- That's my mermaid!
- My baaaaad!

188
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:05,591
Incoming! Uhuh, UH! AH! uhuh.

189
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,089
I would characterize
these mattress as springy.

190
00:10:09,185 --> 00:10:10,469
Springy.

191
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,413
The test results of Mr.Billbray
and Mrs.Sheldon coming yet?

192
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,553
Still waiting.

193
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:17,497
Uh! What d'you think of my manicure?
I got it for the ring.

194
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:18,412
Perfect!

195
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:22,248
What's on today's agenda, lovey?

196
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,947
Well, snookums, I'm first going
to check out the market,

197
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:31,105
then play a few holes of golf, and then pretend
to care about under-privileged people.

198
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:33,368
You know, the usual.

199
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:38,680
Well, I'm off. Though, keep an eye on Lupita.

200
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:41,167
I think some of the silver's gone missing.

201
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:45,010
I'll talk to her.

202
00:10:46,631 --> 00:10:48,958
- Bye Snoggy!
- Okay, have a good day!

203
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:55,745
- You've been a naughty girl, Lupita.
- Si' Señor!

204
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,236
You're looking fine as hell today girl!

205
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:02,669
Get your bum bumped!

206
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,948
He's goaling down!

207
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:09,008
I was all horny about fantasizing about
having sex with my own wife!

208
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:10,910
Damn right!

209
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:15,548
Oooh, poor Turkleberry,
he thinks he's got it hard!

210
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:19,375
The damn internet is down! Where am I
supposed to go for a sexual gratification?

211
00:11:19,486 --> 00:11:20,465
My invalid wife?

212
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,867
Great! Everything came back
negative of Mrs.Sheldon

213
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:26,836
and Mr.Billbray.

214
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:28,489
There must be something that we're missing.

215
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:31,779
But, with you two that would
be impossible. Might I?

216
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:32,918
Take a look at the chart?

217
00:11:33,384 --> 00:11:36,433
Well, it's not PMR, pend hypopig,
and we've already ruled malignancy.

218
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:41,070
Oh yeah! That's it, toffee!

219
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,758
Really, you two think it's that easy?

220
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:48,724
Intern! Test both their patients
for this and don't you

221
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:51,886
dare tell the hearty girls
what it is. Not yet.

222
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:52,752
Go.

223
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,337
- Uh! Room service is great!
- Yeah.

224
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,752
Uh, can I have the tiny ketchup bottle?

225
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:02,550
I'm planning this elaborate prank on Turk,

226
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:04,908
when he wakes up and
thinks he's 20 feet tall.

227
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,403
- Sure.
- Thanks.

228
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:11,664
Allright. Can you think of
anything else we should try?

229
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,701
I think we should try this.

230
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:16,549
<i>Turk was right. He's such a good friend!</i>

231
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:20,754
<i>I should get him a gift. I'llfish for what
he wants later on a secret bathroom call.</i>

232
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:25,079
<i>Wait! Why am I thinking about Turk?
Okay. Start moving your hand...</i>

233
00:12:25,432 --> 00:12:29,379
<i>Next stop... Boobtown, population... two!</i>

234
00:12:29,443 --> 00:12:31,497
Whoa! You can't go to Boobtown!

235
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,595
That, my friend, is a gated community.

236
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:40,307
Oh! You're fully dressed under there!

237
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:42,610
Me too!

238
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:45,338
I gotta go check out the bar,
you wanna come?

239
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:46,941
Sure, I'll be right down.

240
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,308
<i>When you are in a dryspell
sometimes you have to get wet.</i>

241
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:53,146
Great Aunt Judyyyyyyyyy!

242
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:55,599
<i>It doesn't matter if you are married...</i>

243
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,677
<i>If you are all talk but no action...</i>

244
00:12:59,254 --> 00:13:01,948
<i>Or you have a bad internet connection.</i>

245
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,988
<i>All you can do is take solace
in the fact that no one is getting any.</i>

246
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:11,410
The test results are back, and our friends
Mr. Billbury and Mrs. Shelton both

247
00:13:11,554 --> 00:13:14,103
will be having a round
of penicillin for their what?

248
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:18,966
That's right! Their STD. Here,
have a look if you want, pelase.

249
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:24,541
It turns out that our hard candy toated
super cheery grandparents both have...

250
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:26,465
Syphilis!

251
00:13:27,235 --> 00:13:28,004
Bang!

252
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:30,698
<i>Ok, maybe some people were getting some.</i>

253
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,478
<i>But we weren't.</i>

254
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:38,201
Sorry, guys! Thought I fixed that.

255
00:13:42,915 --> 00:13:46,661
- I can't believe they have syphilis.
- Yes, Barbie...

256
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:51,279
Look, when people get old there are certain
things they are no longer able to do, like...

257
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,463
...drive a car over 20 miles an hour
or smell like the living, but...

258
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:58,729
the one thing they damn sure can do
is have sex until they croak.

259
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:02,705
The fact that matters is that thanks to
a variety of male enhancement drugs...

260
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:07,394
sexually transmitted diseases have increased
amongst the elderly by 300 per cent.

261
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,398
Argh, old people sex is disgusting.

262
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:11,466
Really?

263
00:14:12,154 --> 00:14:15,603
Because from time to time I like
to throw back to few blue bombers

264
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,245
and head out on the town.

265
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:19,486
Ok, we're leaving now.

266
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:20,917
You won't go nowhere!

267
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,942
No one will.

268
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:26,696
I will have you all know

269
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:32,030
that just this morning I hoisted Enid
on to the safety rail in our kitchen

270
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:34,822
and we went at it like drunk monkeys.

271
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:40,191
That's right. Now just soak
in that image for a while.

272
00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:46,046
Everybody in the room ok
with pretending that...

273
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:47,195
never happened?

274
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:48,838
- Yes, yes.
- Oh, me. I am!

275
00:14:51,638 --> 00:14:55,169
Great! I'll go tell them
that they have an STD.

276
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,305
I hate you.

277
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,619
I know.

278
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:18,407
Different wife, same story.

279
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:23,134
Hey, fellas!

280
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,922
Here there's a steel magnolia in
room 309 that needs a little pruding.

281
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,594
Todd, she's 68 and have syphilis.

282
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:31,764
Hey, the Todd accepts all applicants.

283
00:15:31,846 --> 00:15:33,371
Regardless of age and disability.

284
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:35,479
Well, I'm giving up on Melody.

285
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:37,250
Dude, no!

286
00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:38,693
Man, me, I'm married.

287
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:40,804
So I may never ever ever have sex again.

288
00:15:40,828 --> 00:15:42,259
You, there's still a chance for you.

289
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:45,256
Damn, if you're gonna do it
for yourself, at least do it for me!

290
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:46,206
And me!

291
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:47,574
For all of us?!

292
00:15:49,604 --> 00:15:51,164
What? You guysare surprised I don't get any?

293
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:54,120
All right, men... I'm going in!

294
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:55,539
<i>Turk was right.</i>

295
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:56,865
<i>I can make this happen.</i>

296
00:15:56,988 --> 00:15:58,947
<i>Because whether Melody
wanted to admit it or not,</i>

297
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:00,825
<i>there was a definite
connection between us!</i>

298
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:03,015
So, thanks for hanging with me last night.

299
00:16:04,118 --> 00:16:05,443
That's not me, Melody!

300
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:08,446
Oh, my bad! You two could be twins.

301
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:09,982
We look nothing alike!

302
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:11,308
What are you, egyptian?

303
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,516
I don't wanna hear it.

304
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:15,953
God, what a day!

305
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:18,674
I cannot believe we didn't figure our patients had STD!

306
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:20,813
You know what should
do blow some esteem?

307
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:23,347
- Go shoe-shopping.
- Yeah, but you know what?

308
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,948
First we should have tender,
emotional sex and then cuddle

309
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:29,317
- and then the shoe-shopping.
- Hmm.

310
00:16:29,411 --> 00:16:31,734
I'm so glad that we are married!

311
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:33,352
Oh, sweetie!

312
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,619
Life would be so much simpler.

313
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:44,325
Great! You are both here.

314
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,448
We need to talk.

315
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:49,300
We were just trading stories
about our grandkids.

316
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,623
They grow up so darn fast!

317
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:53,947
They do! They sure do!

318
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,439
Did you wanna tell us something, sweetheart?

319
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:01,391
I couldn't do it.

320
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:03,835
So, you are gonna need to tell them
to sleep on a love glove,

321
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:05,393
and forgettin to get all freaky and doink.

322
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:07,839
Oh, but don't use those words or they
won't know what you are talking about.

323
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:09,821
Now, if you'll excuse me...

324
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:11,859
I've got a proposal to get ready for.

325
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:17,736
<i>It took everything I had in my arsenal
to get Melody to mack with me again.</i>

326
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:20,536
Hey, do you wanna mack with me again?

327
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:21,685
Sure!

328
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:23,629
<i>This time would be different.</i>

329
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:25,717
<i>The key is not going straight for her chest</i>

330
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,239
<i>...but to start in a more
innocent area, like her hips.</i>

331
00:17:29,971 --> 00:17:32,235
<i>And he sneaks the landing!</i>

332
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:34,616
<i>You see, ultimately
it's all about persistance.</i>

333
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:36,173
<i>Stay decors and...</i>

334
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,167
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uuuuh!

335
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,228
You know the rules and-and
you continue to break them.

336
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:43,437
I think I'm gonna give you
a lifetime macking ban.

337
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:44,469
- No!
- Yes!

338
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,537
Give me another chance.

339
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:47,885
- Can you control yourself?
- Of course I can.

340
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:49,827
God is watching.

341
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,874
I can't.

342
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,452
Who is this " God " everyone fears?

343
00:17:56,282 --> 00:17:57,886
Take these for me? Thank you.

344
00:17:58,352 --> 00:18:00,601
Hey, JD, I was wondering
if I could borrow your scooter,

345
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:01,811
so I could run a few errance--

346
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,500
He looks nothing like me!

347
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:06,254
He doesn't even have any
laughter in his eyes, like, at all!

348
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,954
Uhm, Mrs. Sheldon,

349
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:13,622
Mr. Billbury,

350
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:16,133
Relax, I already told'em both.

351
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,746
And Mrs. Sheldon and Mr. Billbury
have been doing a little talking.

352
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:24,047
Turns out after bridge, every sunday
night, Mrs. Sheldon has been shtooping

353
00:18:24,223 --> 00:18:25,009
Did I say that right?

354
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:26,440
Yes, you did, sweetheart.

355
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:30,929
Okay, shtooping Howard
Steinberg, who is apparently

356
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:34,730
a lot more than tango partners
with Estelle Stevens, who

357
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:36,537
apart from having a fake hip,

358
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:39,352
is a well known hussy in
Mr. Billbury's nursing home.

359
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:43,469
Uh, and Mr. Billbury likes to have a get at
all force and sing "Who let the dogs out?"

360
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:46,087
I'm getting uncomfortable.

361
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:47,260
Oh, you can go.

362
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:53,904
I have to say, I'm very
impressed with your...

363
00:18:54,406 --> 00:18:55,356
vitality.

364
00:18:55,948 --> 00:18:58,846
Honey, let me tell you a secret about sex:

365
00:18:59,162 --> 00:19:01,063
it gives you vitality!

366
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:02,967
Right, Perce?

367
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:04,363
What?

368
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,392
Honestly... I can't imagine how
empty life would be without it.

369
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,820
Can you?

370
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:20,063
Ok, everyone.

371
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,157
Keith's spontanoeus proposal to Elliot
will be happening in exactly one minute.

372
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,800
Elliot has requested
no cellphone photography.

373
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:28,184
Those pictures give her a pan-face.

374
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:30,254
* people agree *

375
00:19:30,932 --> 00:19:35,823
Ok, when she gets here, let's be quiet, and
give her our full and complete attention.

376
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,016
I tell you what's already a full attention.

377
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:43,347
Per-Per? Can I have the beer, please?

378
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:45,998
Can't do, dear.

379
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:48,954
Let me help you down.

380
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:50,781
Good work.

381
00:19:51,016 --> 00:19:53,491
Hey. Let me ask you a question:

382
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:56,162
You don't really seem like the...

383
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,449
notch-on-your bed-pose-type guy,

384
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,054
why are you trying so hard to do me?

385
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:03,408
You know what? I don't even really know.

386
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:05,460
<i>Actually, I did.</i>

387
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:07,595
<i>I just didn't want to admit it.</i>

388
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,176
Uh-uh!

389
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:20,241
Oh-oh my God!

390
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:23,196
What is all this?

391
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:26,540
You know what?

392
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:29,370
I'm really happy to have you in my life.

393
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:31,998
Me too.

394
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:45,263
Elliot Reid--

395
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:46,823
No last name, I changed my mind.

396
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:49,908
Elliot,

397
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,171
will you marry me?

398
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,622
Yes.

399
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,988
Oh my God, yes.

400
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:06,943
Awesome!

401
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,759
<i> As I looked at all the
relationships around me,</i>

402
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,351
<i>some that have gone on forever...</i>

403
00:21:48,783 --> 00:21:50,390
<i>some that were re-ignited...</i>

404
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:57,464
<i>and some that had jus begun,</i>

405
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,174
<i>I realized something:</i>

406
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:06,092
<i>It should have been me.</i>

407
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:08,544
