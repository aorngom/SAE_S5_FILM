1
00:00:00,831 --> 00:00:04,799
You're a fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty!

2
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:05,966
What's your son doing?

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,758
Apparently he's doing the "fatty dance."

4
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:09,935
Inappropriate?

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,127
Well, maybe. But I'm raising my son to be a straight-shooter.

6
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:15,695
That's his mom, right over there.

7
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:17,576
Ohh, thanks for including me.

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,712
Dr. Cox and Jordan weren't the only ones

9
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:20,951
with kid troubles.

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,151
My brand new girlfriend was pregnant,

11
00:00:23,247 --> 00:00:24,936
and we were trying to decide what to do.

12
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:26,582
Should we keep it or get rid of it ?

13
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:27,448
I dunno.

14
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,785
If we keep it, it'll just end up in the dumpster.

15
00:00:30,953 --> 00:00:32,255
Okay! Enough pizza talk

16
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:35,496
I mean, we're clearly stalling, here.
So, uh, let's go...Um....

17
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,267
Do you like kids ?

18
00:00:37,774 --> 00:00:38,614
Of course I do !

19
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:40,500
What about you? Any nieces or nephews?

20
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:41,995
Yeah, I have a nephew.

21
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:43,332
Although he's forty-five.

22
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:44,939
But occasionally I do have to change his diaper.

23
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:46,092
He was kicked by a horse.

24
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:49,725
Yeah. Now, how do you feel about adoption?

25
00:00:51,276 --> 00:00:52,796
So beautiful!

26
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,461
I hope you keep some ice in this locket,

27
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,668
'cause you're making me hot all over!

28
00:00:58,597 --> 00:01:01,109
Actually, it's the only picture I have of my biological father.

29
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,244
D'you wanna see it?

30
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:04,220
What?

31
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:06,173
Oh! Sure!

32
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,029
Uh, I'll take a look at it first thing tomorrow morning, huh?

33
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:12,064
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of adoption.

34
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:13,577
You think if it's a girl, you'd doink her?

35
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:15,227
I know I will.

36
00:01:16,265 --> 00:01:19,554
Yep. All right, well, look, we don't need
to make this decision tonight, right ?

37
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:21,178
I mean, plenty of time.

38
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:22,794
I'm totally fine with stalling.

39
00:01:23,441 --> 00:01:24,608
'Cause if I hear the word "baby" one more time,

40
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:26,538
I'm gonna lose it!

41
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:28,682
Dude! Carla's in labor!

42
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,700
Meet me at the apartment!

43
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,391
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

44
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:34,327
Is he coming? Is he coming!?

45
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:36,726
Turk, she's barely in labor.

46
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:37,743
Oh, he's not talking about the baby.

47
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:41,062
He's here! And now we can have our baby!

48
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:43,492
Okay, Brown Bear,
commence Operation Brown Cub!

49
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:44,788
- Suitcase!
- Check.

50
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:46,196
Stylish big daddy hat!

51
00:01:46,277 --> 00:01:46,628
Check.

52
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:48,267
Big-time collegiate drum-line!

53
00:01:49,308 --> 00:01:49,917
Check!

54
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:53,909
I want the whole world to know

55
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,597
my baby's having a baby!

56
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:07,117
Maybe we should just take your car!

57
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:35,225
'Kay, ladies, we're here; calm down.

58
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:37,414
What the hell took you so long?

59
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,152
Oh, my God, did you stop for food?

60
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:43,543
We had to, honey. J.D. promised the band that we'd feed them.

61
00:02:44,926 --> 00:02:47,272
Yeah, let me get twenty-three cheeseburgers,

62
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,031
twenty-three milkshakes

63
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,520
Miguel, if you don't stop drumming, you're not getting fries.

64
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,670
Twenty-three fri... You know what, twenty-two fries.

65
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:00,046
Twenty-two fries...you didn't think I'd do it, did you.

66
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:03,071
Miguel has such raw talent,

67
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:04,966
but his attitude keeps getting in the way.

68
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:09,694
Yay, congratulations, whoopee, all right, see ya.

69
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:15,925
We are so happy for you!

70
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:23,968
He's so sweet!

71
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,820
You put one of those inside me! What are we gonna do?

72
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:31,619
Turk, you brought my suitcase, right?

73
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,868
Of course I have your suitcase, honey.

74
00:03:44,795 --> 00:03:45,748
What are you doing?

75
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:48,486
Sometimes when you need a miracle,

76
00:03:48,556 --> 00:03:50,341
you have to pray extra-extra hard.

77
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:51,883
You wanna help me out?

78
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:53,995
Fo' shizzle.

79
00:04:18,764 --> 00:04:19,436
Nothing! Okay.

80
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:22,548
Baby! Changed my mind.

81
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,539
Don't have your suitcase.

82
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,387
Turk! What the hell?

83
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,868
It's okay. It's okay, Carla, because I...
packed you an extra overnight bag,

84
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:33,603
you're all checked in, and I got you
an orderly to take you to your room.

85
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,322
Yeah, I'm only four months pregnant, ace.

86
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:39,203
Oh, yeah, I think you're looking for me.

87
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:41,053
Move it along before I eat you!

88
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:42,268
Chop chop.

89
00:04:45,436 --> 00:04:46,845
Ah. Sorry, Jack, the machine's broken.

90
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:49,443
Looks like you're gonna have to guzzle
your juice down without any ice.

91
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,173
Pretend, um.... You know, pretend it's gin.

92
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:54,060
What's gin?

93
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:58,054
Gin is an alcoholic beverage which,

94
00:04:58,134 --> 00:05:01,263
if your mommy's strong genes are any indication,

95
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,900
ou'll eventually learn to love

96
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:07,446
as it slowly destroys
a giant portion of your adult life

97
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,679
First the fat lady, now this?

98
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:14,137
He's three, Perry!
Do you have to be so blunt with him?

99
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:16,793
I'm not gonna B.S. my own kid.
What's the big deal?

100
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:18,935
Hiya, sport!

101
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:21,146
Your skin is wrinkly.

102
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:24,122
Yeah? Well that shirt you're wearing is gay!

103
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,821
Hey, baby. I know things haven't
exactly gone smoothly so far,

104
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:33,545
but I promise you I'm about to make it up to you.

105
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,818
I spent all weekend talking to my cousin

106
00:05:35,906 --> 00:05:38,305
who just so happens to be the world's biggest blerd.

107
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:40,466
It's a black nerd.

108
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,497
Anyway, he taught me everything
about streaming video,

109
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,339
and now, thanks to me, your sisters in Chicago

110
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,419
will be able to witness the birth of our child

111
00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:50,368
live via webcam!

112
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:52,818
Turk! That's so sweet!

113
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:54,341
You know, I do what I do.

114
00:05:55,027 --> 00:05:56,652
All we gotta do is wait for the cameraman to get here.

115
00:05:56,948 --> 00:05:57,812
Camera man? Nuh-uh!

116
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,838
No man's gonna me filming my pooter

117
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:02,443
unless he's completely asexual!

118
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:03,948
Hello!

119
00:06:04,356 --> 00:06:06,075
Oh! Hey, Ted! Cool.

120
00:06:06,763 --> 00:06:07,795
All right. I'ma go tell your sisters

121
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:09,828
that this bad boy is about to pop off.

122
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:14,939
All right, Carla. Let's check how dilated you are.

123
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:17,756
Looking real good, Carla.

124
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:22,061
Okay, we're live in three, two, one....

125
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,890
Okay. Looks like you're at about three centimeters.

126
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:29,827
Greatest show ever!

127
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:34,477
And...record.

128
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:38,567
Cool! Swamp thing!

129
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:41,566
What's that, daddy?

130
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,767
Oh, that's the vagina of a 35-year-old Latina woman.

131
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:50,088
Baby?

132
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,510
What the!?!?

133
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:07,741
J.D., we have to talk about all of our pregnancy options,

134
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,054
even if they make us uncomfortable.

135
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,503
There's one way of dealing with this that no one's mention yet....

136
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,680
The A-word.

137
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:14,294
I know....

138
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:16,158
- Appletinis
-Abortions.

139
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:17,637
What?

140
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,126
I thought that we could discuss

141
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:21,542
abortion over appletinis.

142
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:25,846
Did somebody just say "abortion"?

143
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:29,456
Laverne, with all due respect,

144
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:31,990
this is none of your business. Or Jesus's.

145
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,535
I believe He would beg to differ.

146
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:41,112
She's right, J.D. Every life is precious.

147
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:44,166
But what if having this baby is a huge mistake for us?

148
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:47,608
Okay,

149
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,399
I'm gonna make this real simple: No abortions, okay?

150
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,143
But what if...

151
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:53,887
No abortions!

152
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:55,310
Lemme finish!

153
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:57,877
What if the parents were like abusive drug addicts

154
00:07:57,974 --> 00:07:59,136
who would neglect their kids?

155
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:00,736
Oh, well, in that case it'd be okay.

156
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:01,927
Really?

157
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:05,607
NO ABORTIONS! How are you not getting this!?

158
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,647
This sucks.

159
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:10,693
I mean, the hardest decision I've had to make in the last year

160
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:11,663
was what hairstyle to get.

161
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,429
And even then, all I did was open up an US Magazine,

162
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,503
close my eyes and pick a random celebrity.

163
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:16,929
Kirsten Dunst?

164
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:18,266
Owen Wilson.

165
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,337
You know what's making this so hard?

166
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:22,231
This relationship is so new,

167
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:25,648
we can't tell if we have a chance of making this work long-term.

168
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,624
You know what might give us an inkling?

169
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:30,309
We haven't technically had sex yet.

170
00:08:30,797 --> 00:08:33,847
That might help us find out if we're on the same page...

171
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:36,197
you know...in the boudoir.

172
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,535
Are you hitting on me?

173
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:39,333
I'm sorry, I'm being an idiot, aren't I.

174
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,800
Nope. Clothes off. We're doing it.

175
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,015
...Yeah!

176
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:50,095
All right, we are definitely sexually compatible.

177
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,061
I'm putting that down in the pro "let's have a baby" category.

178
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:54,694
That's--that's exactly what we should do,

179
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,559
we should make a list of pros and cons.

180
00:08:57,031 --> 00:08:58,704
What did you two just do?

181
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,654
Because I sure don't see any wedding rings!

182
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:04,727
Laverne?

183
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:06,272
Is this your Jesus?

184
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,414
Turk, I got your shift covered so you could hang here.

185
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:15,359
Oh, and Carla, there's something I wanted to tell you...

186
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:18,663
Great vagina!

187
00:09:19,006 --> 00:09:19,982
So helpful!

188
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:21,710
Don't take it out on The Todd!

189
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:23,238
He was just giving me a compliment!

190
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:24,493
Thank you, Todd.

191
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,134
Hey, happy to say it.

192
00:09:27,607 --> 00:09:28,791
So what's next, Turk?

193
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,585
Because so far, I'm half deaf from a drum-line,

194
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:32,993
I have no suitcase,

195
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,631
and the entire hospital has seen Miss Priscilla!

196
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:40,106
I named her after my high school art teacher.

197
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:42,329
Oh, my God! So did I!

198
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:44,649
Mr. Hebbler.

199
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,730
"It's nice to meet you!"

200
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:51,009
Okay, let me just read the last of the cons:

201
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,666
We're not married,

202
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:53,104
we're both totally focused on our careers,

203
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:54,642
babies are known to be sticky,

204
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,472
and the average cost of raising a child
is four-hundred-thousand dollars.

205
00:09:58,073 --> 00:09:59,503
Okay. Here are the final pros:

206
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,473
Kids are great...

207
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:01,770
we both make good money,

208
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:03,336
your boobs'll get huge

209
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:05,481
I can finally buy Beanie Babies

210
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:06,698
without feeling weird,

211
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:08,321
and kids are great!

212
00:10:08,627 --> 00:10:09,312
Which we already said.

213
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:11,120
Tax deductions!

214
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,944
All right, so then what's the final tally?

215
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:19,577
Nice. Let's see, that's twenty cons and nineteen pros.

216
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:21,209
I guess we gotta abort.

217
00:10:21,306 --> 00:10:21,834
Yep.

218
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,399
Wait, I'm sorry.

219
00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:26,360
That's an eyelash, I made a wish.

220
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:28,153
It's a tie...abortion's off.

221
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:29,728
Okay, so now what?

222
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:32,890
Every couple has its share of problems.

223
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,783
My son just asked me

224
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:37,598
if my vagina had ever been on television.

225
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:39,933
-And did you tell him not since the late 'eighties

226
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,534
when you were trying to make it as "an actress"?

227
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:43,637
Whether it's someone digging in...

228
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:47,077
Will you just cut the crap and stop
treating your son like he's your drinking buddy?

229
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:50,273
Look, I'm not going to change who I am, all right?
End o' story. Jacky.

230
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:54,944
...or someone stealing your thunder.

231
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:57,600
Okay, candles are all lit...

232
00:10:57,729 --> 00:10:58,921
lavender scented, your favorite.

233
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:00,218
And here's a picture of your mom

234
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:01,473
to watch over you.

235
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,834
And then I've got this kit in case you want to bronze

236
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,896
the umbilical cord and use it for a keychain.

237
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:07,018
I practiced at home on some calamari.

238
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:09,152
Elliot, you're amazing.

239
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:11,217
We...hey, is there anything I can do to help?

240
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:12,866
Elliot's got everything covered.

241
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:19,532
Still, nothing's worse than facing the biggest decision of your life

242
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:20,924
and not getting anywhere.

243
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:22,508
Don't you wish it was this easy.

244
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,602
Head's yes, tail's no.

245
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,301
You don't see that every day.

246
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:55,362
You know what? We're getting nowhere.

247
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:57,274
Let's split up for an hour and do some soul-searching.

248
00:11:58,381 --> 00:11:59,018
Where're you going?

249
00:12:00,363 --> 00:12:01,581
Oh, I was just gonna walk around.

250
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:03,843
Why? Where do you go when you soul-search?

251
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:09,941
All right, Justin.

252
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:11,919
What should my specialty be,

253
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:14,695
oncology or radiology?

254
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:20,774
I go someplace wonderful.

255
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:24,345
Anyway, I was thinking we need
new table linens for the dining room.

256
00:12:24,456 --> 00:12:27,760
Well, not so much table linens as placemats.

257
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:29,305
What do think's prettier,

258
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:30,601
burgundy or mauve?

259
00:12:30,753 --> 00:12:32,121
What the hell's with her?

260
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:34,005
She's mad. But she can't give me the silent treatment

261
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:35,785
because she
knows I'd actually love that,

262
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:38,904
so she's giving me the
talk-until-I-want-to-commit-suicide treatment.

263
00:12:39,544 --> 00:12:40,473
Sucks to be you.

264
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:42,834
You have no idea.

265
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:44,362
...What else do I need for that?

266
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,338
Oh, I need new pillow shams.

267
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,041
And I--I like cotton,

268
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:50,233
but I think we should get a cotton blend  because

269
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:51,649
that's easier to clean,

270
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,554
and I hate ironing.

271
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:55,576
Maybe we need a new housekeeper.

272
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,207
Maybe the housekeeper should come every single day now.

273
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:00,808
Look, Elliot, I'm really trying to be involved

274
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,960
in the birth of my child,

275
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,312
but you just keep boxing me out.

276
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:05,362
That is not true. Now, outta my way,

277
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:06,624
I've gotta order the birth announcements,

278
00:13:06,707 --> 00:13:07,641
put in the carseat,

279
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,320
and find a yard to bury the placenta.

280
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,905
Oh, my God, I'm a monster!

281
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,569
Turk, I am so sorry.

282
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,801
I just love babies so much.

283
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:17,087
It's true.

284
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:18,680
Sometimes she makes me wear a diaper.

285
00:13:18,793 --> 00:13:20,138
Keith! Private!

286
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,688
So what is Elliot's plan?

287
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:26,305
Ah, it's really simple:

288
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:28,009
See, when Carla says "I'm thirsty,"

289
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:30,585
Elliot'll say, "Oh no, I forgot the ice chips."

290
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:32,209
That's when I walk in,

291
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,434
ice in hand,

292
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,137
and I say, "Christopher Turk,

293
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,176
at your cervix!"

294
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:39,057
Ahh! Should I have a baby, too?

295
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:41,736
You know, I'm a little preoccupied right now.

296
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:43,424
Why don't you ask your unicorn?

297
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:45,281
Ah, this is way over Justin's head.

298
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:47,097
He's never been in love.

299
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:49,265
Not real love, anyway.

300
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:52,474
What's up with the ice?

301
00:13:53,953 --> 00:13:54,770
I don't know what to do.

302
00:13:54,898 --> 00:13:57,073
I mean, having a baby can completely ruin your life,

303
00:13:57,263 --> 00:13:59,370
you know? Not to mention, as a urologist,

304
00:13:59,497 --> 00:14:01,625
I have seen what childbirth can do to you down there.

305
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,568
I mean, I examined this
one woman last month and it was like

306
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:07,768
"Hello...hello...hello...hello..."

307
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:09,873
Not a good time, Kim!

308
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:13,530
Oh, God, I'm thirsty!

309
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:15,122
Really?

310
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:18,832
Unfortunately...I forgot the ice chips.

311
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:22,081
ICE CHIPS!

312
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,992
Dude, help! I'm totally stuck!

313
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,264
Why don't you just yank it out?

314
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,128
I would not do that.

315
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:30,959
That's how it happened!

316
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:33,993
Ice chips! Ice chips! Ice ice! Chips chips!

317
00:14:34,935 --> 00:14:36,039
Hey, guys.

318
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:39,583
Carla, let me just see how far you can reach here.

319
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,887
Okay, perfect.

320
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:43,062
Turk would like you to call him

321
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:44,743
because he's stuck in an ice machine.

322
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:46,327
What?!?!

323
00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:48,597
See, that's why I took the precaution. Heh.

324
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:53,847
Kim, would you be a sweetie and give Turk a call for me?

325
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:55,101
Yes, ma'am.

326
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:57,136
Hey, baby, look, I...

327
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,054
Yeah, he..he's right here.

328
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:02,348
She won't talk to me.

329
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,579
Hi.

330
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,923
Yes, I know he missed your wedding, too.

331
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:08,483
All right, hold on.

332
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,020
That was from her, not me.

333
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:12,386
Go.

334
00:15:14,587 --> 00:15:16,498
Relax, I'll have him out in one second.

335
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:18,162
All right, hold still

336
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,426
nobody likes a jagged stump.

337
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:20,259
NOOO!

338
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:23,540
He's being unreasonable.

339
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:25,029
Okay.

340
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:30,848
That was from me.

341
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:39,419
you decided what you wanna do?

342
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,555
You know what, neither one of us should have to go first.

343
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:45,226
How about, on the count of three,
we both say what we think we should do.

344
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:46,075
Okay.

345
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:46,761
One,

346
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:47,466
two,

347
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:48,155
three.

348
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,266
- I got nothing.
- Appletinis.

349
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,092
So, you guys gonna keep it?

350
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:57,276
- Um, maybe...we--well, if we do--we can--then we...maybe not.
- Um, we don't--prob--well, there's a lot to con--because--we'll probably

351
00:15:57,565 --> 00:15:58,395
- ...maybe not.
- ...maybe not.

352
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,612
You know, I had an abortion.

353
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:03,675
All right, Jacky, as promised,

354
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:05,388
let's go find ourselves a li'l stethoscope

355
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,404
so you can hear what your butt sounds like.

356
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:10,418
Daddy, what's an abortion?

357
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:12,268
Enjoy.

358
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,010
My mommy had an abortion. My mommy had an abortion....

359
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:21,499
How you doin'?

360
00:16:24,058 --> 00:16:25,865
Okay, Janitor, Carla's starting to push, tell Turk.

361
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:26,864
Got it.

362
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:28,394
Your baby has a tail.

363
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:31,415
I told her to stay away from the microwave.

364
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:34,887
Ahhh! Elliot, I can't do it!

365
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:37,246
I want you to imagine that your uterus

366
00:16:37,358 --> 00:16:38,646
is like a tube of toothpaste,

367
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,421
and you're just trying to squeeze out all that minty fresh gel.

368
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:42,919
But instead of minty fresh gel inside,

369
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:44,991
there's a little black baby.

370
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:48,511
We have a prolapsed umbilical cord.

371
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:49,541
She needs a C-section right now.

372
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,958
Put Turk on the phone, dammit!

373
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,237
Baby! Listen.

374
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:56,772
I'm not angry that you got stuck,

375
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:58,462
I know you were just trying to be nice,

376
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:02,421
because you're a good-hearted, wonderful,
thoughtful man. But listen to me:

377
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:04,663
They're giving me a C-section,

378
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:08,320
and I'm really scared. And I need you
to be here right now!

379
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:11,165
Something about a C-section.

380
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:12,486
Smile!

381
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:23,741
Almost there.

382
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:25,030
Almost there.

383
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:28,094
Baby! I'm here!

384
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:29,982
Turk! I'm scared!

385
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:32,533
Sorry, Dr. Turk. No ice machines.

386
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:34,151
Noo!

387
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:38,414
I was nineteen

388
00:17:38,597 --> 00:17:40,551
and working on Nantucket as a waitress,

389
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:43,709
and dating this amazing guy named Andy..

390
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:45,527
with curly blond hair

391
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:46,709
and dimples

392
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:48,415
and eyes that were either

393
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:52,103
sky blue...powder blue. I could never figure out which...

394
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:55,558
Anyway, his best friend, Curt, knocked me up.

395
00:17:57,846 --> 00:17:58,830
Don't look at me like that.

396
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:00,847
That was the first guy I had ever slept with.

397
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:02,645
Oh, we're not judging you.

398
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:04,534
whore!

399
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,094
I think about it from time to time,

400
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,311
but it would have been the biggest mistake

401
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,543
to have that baby.

402
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:11,013
We've talked, we've made lists,

403
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:14,655
and we've been as logical as we can here,
and we've still got nothin'.

404
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,255
It's not a logical decision.

405
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:18,060
If it's right, you'll feel it in your heart.

406
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,652
Yeah, but what if we don't feel anything?

407
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:23,720
Maybe that's your answer.

408
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,084
Carla's having a C-section.

409
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,931
Jordan, you...you okay?

410
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:39,292
My mommy had an abortion.

411
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:41,683
She sure did, sweetie.

412
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:45,446
How are my boys?

413
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,245
What's going on?

414
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:52,162
They're about to start

415
00:18:53,394 --> 00:18:54,130
Turkleton!

416
00:18:54,852 --> 00:18:57,644
If you are trying to get the same five million dollar

417
00:18:57,828 --> 00:18:59,999
settlement that damn hook-handed security guard got,

418
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,000
you're outta luck, stud.

419
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,258
Because I put a little release button right here on top.

420
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,947
Well, what are you waiting for, son? Get in there.

421
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:19,162
How you doin', beautiful?

422
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:21,394
Turk, you're here...!

423
00:19:22,988 --> 00:19:24,155
I'm so hot....

424
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:26,465
Oh, don't sweat it.

425
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:28,739
I got ya.

426
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,236
Guys.

427
00:19:37,185 --> 00:19:38,331
I have an announcement.

428
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:40,762
Miguel, please!

429
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,860
The baby's out,

430
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:44,266
but the cord was wrapped around its neck,

431
00:19:44,547 --> 00:19:46,298
so...we had to take it to the NICU.

432
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:48,715
They say you never realize your capacity to love

433
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:50,426
until you have a child.

434
00:19:51,138 --> 00:19:52,530
It can change who you are...

435
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,722
Where do babies come from?

436
00:19:57,346 --> 00:19:58,723
"Where do babies come from?

437
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,041
When a mommy

438
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:09,489
and a daddy love each other very, very much,

439
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:12,167
sometimes they close their eyes...

440
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,799
and they make a wish.

441
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:21,690
...they can fill you with joy...

442
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:23,567
Ladies and gentlemen,

443
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,322
I would like to introduce you

444
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,569
to Isabella Turk.

445
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,304
I'm a daddy. I'm a daddy!

446
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,463
...it can even give your heart

447
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:51,519
the answer you thought you'd never find.

448
00:20:58,249 --> 00:20:59,290
Let's do this.
