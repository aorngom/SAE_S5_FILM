1
00:00:01,825 --> 00:00:03,089
Well, I don't get it, sir.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,452
Why do our doctors have to put a picture
of themselves in their patients' rooms?

3
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:10,693
'Cause, Ted, not only does it make
our doctors more accountable,

4
00:00:10,694 --> 00:00:13,473
but a recent AMA study showed
that it helps our patients

5
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:15,379
feel much closer bond with their phisician.

6
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:18,795
Plus, who would mark this
young bucketer bedside.

7
00:00:19,548 --> 00:00:22,591
That picture's so old that
beaches are still segregated.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,028
Look, they got us way in the back,

9
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:27,655
doesn't that bother you?

10
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,545
Good God I'm stunning.

11
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:32,070
Besides, have you seen
everyone else's picture?

12
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:35,111
Turk!

13
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:37,700
Baby, ain't nobody lookin' at you.

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,985
Where was that taken?

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,075
Sears. Do you want a copy?

16
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:48,068
<i>Dr. Cox and I were both taking care of Private Dancer.</i>

17
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:52,535
See, I went with a younger picture,
'cause Ilike the father/son motif.

18
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:54,563
That is taken seconds after I won

19
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:57,894
the watermelon seed spitting
contest at my theatre camp.

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,089
Probably my happiest day as a tennager.

21
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:05,480
That is both very sad and,
not the least, bit shocking.

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,322
So, Brian, since we found  they're getting
you discharged, we  came to say goodbye.

23
00:01:08,522 --> 00:01:09,537
What's next for you, man?

24
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:11,181
I'm goin' back in the army.

25
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:14,234
I know it's gonna take a lot
of phisical therapy, but...

26
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,007
that's where I belong, you know.

27
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:18,320
All the best, dear soldier-boy.

28
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:20,810
<i>Brian cared abot one goodbye more than others.</i>

29
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,829
Hey, uhm, would-would you sign this?

30
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:26,853
I promise you I'll...put that up in barracks.

31
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,985
So d'you want me to start it with
I can still walk normally

32
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:32,632
and then sag away into an anecdote  about
how you play my tush like a bunghole

33
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,511
until i cry down in pleasure-pain?

34
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:35,348
Sorry?

35
00:01:35,818 --> 00:01:38,707
Your army buddies are gonna see it,
I assumed...you wanted it filthy.

36
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:40,972
No...filthy is cool.

37
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:45,839
ccc

38
00:01:45,992 --> 00:01:48,258
Private Dancer, more like

39
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:51,516
Man, he sure has a positive outlook on life!

40
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,896
Right?

41
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,070
Carla, you're a rascal,

42
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:57,264
I can't help it notice young love-making jokes

43
00:01:57,311 --> 00:02:01,892
What the...what the devil was that
you were saying about your coffee?

44
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:04,117
I said: "It's so good it's like crack!"

45
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:09,058
I'm telling you guys, it really is.

46
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:14,091
You would hear crickets chirping,
but they were too uncomfortable

47
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,005
about just how unfunny that actually was.

48
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:18,737
So what, I'm not funny?

49
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:20,367
Oh, I think you're very funny,

50
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:23,578
when you're being sarcastic or
you're up on your high horse.

51
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:26,751
You know, as long as you stay
right in your wheel house.

52
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:28,688
And it's no different for any of us.

53
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:32,382
Barbie is funniest when she's
an anal retentive train wreck,

54
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:34,739
your husband sells it with a cocky attitude.

55
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:38,171
Yeah, ya know, I do what I do
when I do what I do.

56
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:41,645
The janitor is amusing
because quite frankly he's insane.

57
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,444
I made shoes for my rabbit.

58
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:47,420
And Alice here, well, she can turn a phrase.

59
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,508
I assume that because
I just called you Alice,

60
00:02:52,077 --> 00:02:55,858
that you're now fantasizing about me
being the maid in the Brady bunch...

61
00:02:56,991 --> 00:02:57,747
<i>Am I right?</i>

62
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:00,132
<i>He was.</i>

63
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:03,019
Now sadly, some people just aren't funny, but...

64
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:05,703
they have got funny names. For example:

65
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:11,057
Dr. Beardface, Dr. Mickhead, Colonel
Doctor and Snoop Dogg Intern.

66
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:11,651
Hey, hey.

67
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,393
My bad, Snoop Dog Resident.

68
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:17,744
The Todd is a sexual deviant, Laverne
believes in God, which is hilarious to me,

69
00:03:17,745 --> 00:03:20,610
and Ted is the hospital sad sack.

70
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:22,138
- I am?
- Yes.

71
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,346
Awwwwww.

72
00:03:23,545 --> 00:03:26,884
And me, well, I'm funny because I commit.

73
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:33,988
C-O-M-M-I-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T...T

74
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:37,612
I also do, uh, funny rants.

75
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:40,627
To tell you the truth, there is only
one guy in this entire dump

76
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,704
who is funny no matter what he says.

77
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:45,373
Holy hell, are my new boxers made of wool?

78
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,668
Because my weasel's getting heat stroke!

79
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,444
The point is:

80
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:55,338
please, don't tell any more jokes.

81
00:03:57,684 --> 00:04:01,538
- I'm not a sad sack, am I?
- Ted, your pen exploded.

82
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:03,197
Awwww.

83
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:04,938
Awwwwwwwwwww.

84
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,956
- Bitches, leave!
- It's go-time.

85
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,568
No no no no no...we're playing "Guess
the movie quote". That was from Robocop.

86
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:14,664
It's my turn.

87
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,655
- "I could've got more out ..."
- "Schindler's List".

88
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:22,956
I took my college girlfriend Stacy Blue
to see that on our first date.

89
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:26,026
I cried, she didn't.
Always thought that was weird.

90
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:28,535
- I remember Stacy...
- Of course you do, Turk,

91
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:32,788
- you banged her while I was in Theology.
- For the hundredth time, nothing happened!

92
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,624
We had a water-balloon fight,
got wet and took our clothes off.

93
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,282
- You walked in and thought the worst.
- There were no water balloons.

94
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:40,996
I looked, no balloons. You know
what, I'm tired of this story.

95
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:43,667
I have Stacy's number on
my phone, I'm gonna call her

96
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:45,812
- and we'll throw it up once and for all.
- Call her!

97
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:47,737
Hi, Mrs. Blue?

98
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:50,258
Hi, it's, uhm,  Dr. John Dorian,

99
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,878
I dated your beautiful daughter,
Stacy, when we were in college.

100
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:57,011
She's dead?

101
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:02,269
- She fell asleep in the pool?
- Oh, my God!

102
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:06,308
Incidentally did she ever mention
banging a black guy...

103
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:10,195
when she was in college?
Had a high top fade like Kid'n'Play.

104
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:15,209
Kid, Kid, Kid'n'Play, you know, they were
a rap group. Your dead daughter loved them.

105
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,856
- Hello?!
- Real smooth!

106
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:23,189
You know what, Turk, I wouldn't mess
with me on watermelon day.

107
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:27,790
- Ooohhhhh!
- Aahh! I've just changed my shirt!

108
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,236
My chicken!

109
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,044
<b>Scrubs - Season 06 Episode 12
My Fishbowl</b>

110
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,979
JD, come on, let's go!

111
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:51,345
- Where did you get that fish?
- Mr. Roth, who owns the pet store...

112
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:52,971
he's so excited to be in remission,

113
00:05:52,972 --> 00:05:55,844
he got all the doctors who helped
him out a pet as a thank you.

114
00:05:56,142 --> 00:05:58,828
- Who else worked on that case?
- Snoop Dog Resident.

115
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:02,208
My Hoos are gonna love this.

116
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,239
Hey, why are you checking
Private Dancer's blood sugar?

117
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,617
- He's being discharged.
- Not yet, he isn't.

118
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:13,495
<i> They had just found him unconscious.</i>

119
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:14,734
Could you hold this?

120
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:19,212
- Oh, damn!
-What?

121
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:22,098
I don't know if it's old age
that's slowing me down,

122
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:24,676
or maybe all that blood I lost
last night fighting that hobo,

123
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:26,320
but I just blew that.  I should have said,

124
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:30,357
"You think my job is so unimportant that
I can stand around all day holding a fish?"

125
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:35,352
I can have you all moppy tonight, when we're
out clubbing and on throwing me off my game.

126
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:37,137
Fine. I'll wait here

127
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,240
- and do this thing right.
- Ok.

128
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:48,595
Well, it was quite scaring,
but he's stable and breathing now.

129
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:51,816
- What happened?
- I'm hoping one of you will figure it out.

130
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,548
He is low on meds carton.

131
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,337
Maybe some of the meds have
just made his prescriptions up.

132
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:59,153
He'll regain consciousness soon.

133
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:01,275
- I'm gonna wait it up.
- I wil too.

134
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:04,777
- Keith is out of town, I can stay.
- And so can we.

135
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:06,984
No, we can't!

136
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,759
Baby, remember? We're supposed
to renew our relations tonight

137
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,304
- ...for the first time since Izzie was born.
- Well, I guess the only thing

138
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:15,952
you gonna renew tonight
is your driver's licence. Hello?

139
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:19,989
- Wow!
- I'm funny, damn it!

140
00:07:20,402 --> 00:07:25,857
Maybe you not being able to have sex tonight
is Karmic payback for having sex with Stacy.

141
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,590
- JD, drop it!
- What happened that night?

142
00:07:29,444 --> 00:07:31,003
This is how I remember it:

143
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:34,721
<i> I was coming down from class
and outside my room I heard</i>

144
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,421
"Oh, my God, it's true
what they say about black guys!"

145
00:07:38,882 --> 00:07:42,684
<i> Then I open the door and
I see you and Stacy. So I said:</i>

146
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:45,967
"Get off my girl before
I kick your ass so deep,

147
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:48,219
you won't be crappin' my kids for a week!"

148
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:49,342
<i>Then you said:</i>

149
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:52,788
"Chill out, doooog, you know you my boyyy!

150
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:56,093
This ain't be what it looks like, aaaaight?"

151
00:07:56,816 --> 00:08:00,881
- But it wasn't aight, was it Turk?
- This is what really happened.

152
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,494
<i>Stacy and I were waiting for you
to come back from class, and she said:</i>

153
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,076
"Hey, we should have a water-balloon fight!"

154
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:11,936
<i>We got all wet from the water balloons
and Stacy was like:</i>

155
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:16,969
"Bbrr, I'm cold! Let's take off our clothes,
get under the covers and warm up!"

156
00:08:18,763 --> 00:08:22,181
<i>Then you came back from your class
and you heard Stacy saying:</i>

157
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:26,000
"Oh, my God, it's true what
they say about black guys!"

158
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,785
<i>Then you came in and said...</i>

159
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:29,545
"Uh, hey guys..."

160
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:34,158
Calm down JD, this isn't
what it looks like.

161
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:35,776
<i>Then I said:</i>

162
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:37,366
All right?

163
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,682
- Nothing happened. So drop it.
- No balloons!

164
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:44,152
And we didn't even have a basketball!

165
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:45,714
What the hell!

166
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:49,291
Who changed my picture?!

167
00:08:49,532 --> 00:08:52,230
But it better not be like
this in all the other rooms...

168
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:55,495
Hey jerk, you think I
got nothing better than...

169
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:58,320
Sorry. Wrong jerk.

170
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,402
Dorian. Take it forever and there...
I should just... I' m gonna smash it!

171
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:05,787
He knows that I'm gonna smash it.

172
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:07,746
He wants me to smash it.

173
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,431
He wants to prove that I can't "not
smash" it. It's a head game.

174
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,002
You're never gonna win a head
game with me, Dorian. Never. Never!

175
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:22,466
No, Turk, I know that face.
Don't you dare make a foofy.

176
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:25,078
Baby, I had a big whole
lunch. Now I got to...

177
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:27,577
- ... down town, push down.
- No!

178
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,493
- Can I just have a little one?
- No.

179
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:36,620
Oh, my God! You think
farts are funny too?

180
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,814
- We can't let them know!
- Shhh. No, no. Not that, that.

181
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,602
I changed his picture.

182
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,086
He says I can't make jokes,

183
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:45,066
- but that's funny, right?
- Not really.

184
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:47,990
I mean, those pictures are
there to reassure the patients.

185
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:52,163
I can't believe this! My picture's
been changed in every single room.

186
00:09:52,164 --> 00:09:55,006
I mean, what the hell! If I wanted
my patients to be more depressed,

187
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:57,587
I'd just have them read
noobie's latest blog entry!

188
00:09:57,588 --> 00:10:00,468
"Why being really lonely is
sometimes super awesome?"

189
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:01,977
Mm!

190
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,264
- Why would anyone do this to me?
- It's a mystery's what it is.

191
00:10:06,477 --> 00:10:10,892
I'm never surprised by what people
will do. Or, for that matter...

192
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,731
- ... who they will do.
- I'm outta here!

193
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:16,400
Bathroom break.

194
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,389
Turk, don't go.

195
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:24,378
Oh, you're right there, listening
to my every move, aren't you?

196
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:28,409
A small child vomited downstairs.
It smells like pickles and milk.

197
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:32,597
Sort of like one of Enid's burps. Consider
it a chance for you to prove yourself.

198
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:39,188
Yes sir. In fact it-Wait up!
Let's work together.

199
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:41,760
<i>I'll tell you about my favorite
stain. Let's turn this corner!</i>

200
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,430
Oh, you're good.

201
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:51,547
Guys, I think I figured
out what happened to Brian.

202
00:10:51,548 --> 00:10:55,168
This letter from the army says his injuries
are too severe to let him back into service.

203
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,284
The army is his life.

204
00:10:57,653 --> 00:11:00,336
He didn't take too
many pills by accident.

205
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:03,017
- He's tried to commit suicide.
- We can't discharge him.

206
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:04,388
We gotta get him one of the shrinks.

207
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:08,344
The only way we can make him stay
here is if he admits that he did it.

208
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:10,246
Yeah, well, I didn't do it.

209
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:16,548
It's like you said earlier. I
must have mixed up my prescriptions.

210
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,669
and taken too many of one.

211
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,650
- How long have you been awake?
- Long enough to know that you need to fart.

212
00:11:22,191 --> 00:11:24,476
and Carla is not funny,

213
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:28,863
- and JD's imitation of a black guy is really racist.
- He be trippin'?

214
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:33,562
Brian, this is just a sad back. You can't
let it take you to such a bad place.

215
00:11:33,563 --> 00:11:35,847
Aah!. Not a bad place.

216
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:38,093
But if I were, it'd be
understandable, right?

217
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:41,043
Cause, what the hell do I have to live for?

218
00:11:41,142 --> 00:11:44,830
I mean, the only thing waiting
for me in my crappy apartment is

219
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:47,700
this whole disability chat to remind me

220
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:51,164
that the only place that I ever felt like
I really belonged doesn't want me anymore.

221
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,947
But no worry. I'm sure there's
a huge demand out there

222
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,296
for a high school grad
who can't sign his name

223
00:11:57,465 --> 00:12:00,244
and gets confused by stuff that
won't phase a five year old.

224
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:06,150
There is no happy future for me, so please,
do not tell me it's all gonna turn around.

225
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:09,314
Nobody's leavin'this room until
you admit to us what you did.

226
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,770
Why should I admit anything to
you since you guys aren't, uhm...

227
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:14,457
...that truthful one to  each other

228
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:18,184
<i>Sometimes to get the truth out of
someone, you have to come clean yourself.</i>

229
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:20,935
Dr. Cox, I'm the one
who switched your picture.

230
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,288
Carla!

231
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:24,635
- I slept with Stacy.
- I knew it!

232
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:27,086
<i>Of course some admissions
you don't see coming.</i>

233
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:29,546
I once tried to kill myself.

234
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:39,616
<i>After Elliot told us that
she attempted suicide,</i>

235
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:42,423
<i>I had to ask the question
that was on everybody's mind.</i>

236
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:44,078
Was that because I broke up with you?

237
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:47,600
- No, JD.
- Oh, good, good, good, good!

238
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:50,312
I'm not even sure why I did it.

239
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:53,735
These things just catch up with you,
you know, you get lonely, not happy

240
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:57,056
- with what's happening in your life...
- An amazing guy breaks up with you...

241
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:59,746
JD, this is not about you! I was sixteen!

242
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:01,200
So how'd you tried it?

243
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,971
- Brian!
- Please, you 're dying to know!

244
00:13:03,972 --> 00:13:06,086
-Do I?! I'm not--
- Carla, it's fine!

245
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:08,661
I was on the poetry back then,

246
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:12,594
you know, Sylvia Plath and Virginia
Woolf...I know, shocker, huh?!

247
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:14,046
All they both kill themselves.

248
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:15,775
Plath stuck her head in the oven

249
00:13:15,776 --> 00:13:19,401
but that was not an option for me,
because everytime my head gets hot

250
00:13:19,402 --> 00:13:23,675
I need to pee and I was not about to be
found lying in a puddle of my own urine.

251
00:13:23,797 --> 00:13:26,118
Not again, not after the prom fiasco.

252
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:28,645
If you're still not sure why
you tried to off yourself,

253
00:13:28,646 --> 00:13:30,814
I'm starting to get a pretty
clear picture over here.

254
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:36,953
So, I decided to do like Virginia Woolf, I
walked into a lake and tried to drown myself.

255
00:13:36,954 --> 00:13:38,271
Cut a parley on a saturday,

256
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:41,207
- put on my bikini..
- Wow, why would you wear a bikini?

257
00:13:41,538 --> 00:13:44,617
Oh, my one-piece was in the back of Coach Punjadi's car.

258
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:50,469
That story informs this one, but I'm not going to tell it...anyhow,

259
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,503
...I swam up to the middle of the lake,
and I couldn't bring to myself to go under

260
00:13:54,504 --> 00:13:57,433
so I just started, you know,
floating around...

261
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,713
...waiting to get tired, and then,
BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM,

262
00:14:01,191 --> 00:14:04,835
I got hit in the head by four whores
as our school's ralling team passed by.

263
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:09,187
and then they just... picked me out of the lake and took me home.

264
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:14,432
Oh no, Turk, I know that look, don't you
dare to while Elliot is baring her soul.

265
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:18,420
Oh baby, the pressure is building,
no one on Earth is this uncomfortable.

266
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:22,273
Oh, no! I have to pee!

267
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:26,342
Come on, fight it man, think about
something else, take your mind of it.

268
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:33,693
Here we go, uh! It passed...and that's
a big bowl of swishy liquid. Damn it!

269
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:39,121
Look, Elliot, I appreciate
what you trying to do

270
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:42,342
but none of you guys has any idea what is
like to feel this hopeless in your life.

271
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:45,744
- You know other than JD.
* People agree with Brian *

272
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:50,207
- Wait, wait! What's happening?
- Go, Brian, I know exactly how you're feeling,

273
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,028
you should have seen me when I was
dealing with post partum depression,

274
00:14:53,244 --> 00:14:54,568
I just wanted out!

275
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:58,799
I'm so glad that I didn't do anything
because I got on antidepressives

276
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,091
- and now I don't feel that way.
- That's right!

277
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:04,807
And my baby being happy is worth
all the vaginal dryness in the world.

278
00:15:04,808 --> 00:15:09,085
<i>And none of us would ever
look at Carla the same way again.</i>

279
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:12,001
How long can he stay in there?

280
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,582
I don't need anithing since
I stole that hobo's pecan pie.

281
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,468
<i>Come on, buddy! Get it together!</i>

282
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:20,505
<i>How you doing? The name is Roger Dorsey.</i>

283
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,033
That's not real, I'm starting to lose it.

284
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:25,541
<i>How do you know I'm not real?</i>

285
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:28,039
Well, for one thing,
you're just using my voice,

286
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,697
only slightly higher, like this:
"How you doing buddy?"

287
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,453
<i>Oh yeah? If I wasn't real,
could I hit this note?</i>

288
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:38,557
* Fish hits an high note *

289
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:40,367
That was lovely!

290
00:15:43,557 --> 00:15:46,987
We all have those bleed moments when
we swear we'll never bounce back...

291
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:52,804
Like when I was seventeen, my mom walked
in my room with I look that I'd never seen

292
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:59,181
she said "It's over Turk, Micheal
Jordan's career is over."

293
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:03,651
- Is anyone a bigger idiot than you?
- Is he the black golfer?

294
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:06,410
My point is we don't know
what the future holds.

295
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:09,333
Yeah, well, I know what my future holds,
if I hold this fart in any longer!

296
00:16:09,414 --> 00:16:10,757
<i>I wonder what would happen.</i>

297
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:13,300
- Fine. Let me move out the way!
- And everybody clear back!

298
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:29,451
If only I had a satellite
I could have ridden you.

299
00:16:31,545 --> 00:16:33,179
Never seen 'em alive, were they good?

300
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:37,885
If you are wondering why I'm wearing these...

301
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:42,346
...It's partly because at the Kelso
family Christmas we all pick one name

302
00:16:42,347 --> 00:16:45,669
out of the hat to buy a gift for,
and I was lucky enough

303
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,777
to be chosen by my son Harrison's
new life partner RayRay.

304
00:16:50,005 --> 00:16:52,456
The other reason is that my work shoes

305
00:16:52,457 --> 00:16:55,564
are coated in the taddler vomit
I told you to clean up earlier.

306
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,619
Now, are you going to get on it
or am I dogging your pay?

307
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:03,406
You do what you have to do sir, Roger
Dorsey and are seeing this thing till finish.

308
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:07,932
Roger Dorsey was my squad leader
Vietnam, he died in my arms.

309
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,904
<i>Tell Bob I love him.</i>

310
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:16,505
Guys, it's been really great to sharing,
really, but, I... I gotta get dressed.

311
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:20,252
You win. I see your point.
Here is the name of a really good...

312
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:23,296
- ...therapist.
- Look, I know,

313
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:24,896
uhm, you think I owe it to myself?

314
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:27,666
Please! Who cares about you?

315
00:17:28,483 --> 00:17:31,309
Never mind the fact that
we've been busting our asses

316
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,976
trying to take care of you
every day for the last three weeks.

317
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:36,859
I mean, for God's sake, if I've known back then

318
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,446
that you were just gonna go ahead and give
up, I would have saved myself a huge hassle,

319
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:43,357
smothered you with a pillow
and spent all my extra time catching up

320
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:44,690
on Noobie's pathetic blog.

321
00:17:45,338 --> 00:17:48,850
<i> Oh, my God, he referenced me
in a tough love speech. Stop smiling!</i>

322
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,700
So, no, Brian, no! You don't owe
anything to yourself, but...

323
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,573
you damn sure owe to each one of us.

324
00:17:57,537 --> 00:17:58,429
All right, then.

325
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:02,504
I'll call him.

326
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:09,302
Brrrr! Ahhhh! Damn crap!
Auch, auh, auh, auh!

327
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:16,935
You think that's funny? Making me
kill that helpless little animal?

328
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:19,348
If you didn't wanna hold it for me
you could have put it on the counter.

329
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:24,626
Me? No! You, you were...
I tried... I hadn't...

330
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,902
Rayray? I started to...

331
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,306
<i>It's so cold!</i>

332
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:34,090
Roger? Rog? Stay with me buddy!

333
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,578
This isn't now. Go get me some water.

334
00:18:39,997 --> 00:18:43,959
<i> Now, when Brian had turned the corner
allowed us had to get back to our own present issues.</i>

335
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:47,870
I can't believe you are pissed about
Stacy. If I could go back in time

336
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:50,993
- and I'd sleep with her... I would!
- Well, unfortunately she's dead, Turk!

337
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:52,843
Congratulations! You win again.

338
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,937
I don't care what you say, I'm as funny
as anybody else in this place.

339
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,993
Uhaahhh!

340
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:07,162
That was actually pretty good!

341
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,805
Hey Brian, wait up.

342
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:14,223
You accidentally left that shrink's phone number in...

343
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:17,181
- your room's trash can.
- Uhm, whoops, okay.

344
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:19,199
You gonna stop finding all my notes.

345
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:21,650
You know what really helped me
when I went through this?

346
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:25,650
Elliot, you didn't go through this!

347
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:30,261
You went for a leisurely afternoon drown
and you got hit in the face with a paddle.

348
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,952
I spent my entire childhood
as an awkward lonely outcast.

349
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,853
With a floody mum who liked to talk
about how fat I was.

350
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:41,594
I had zero self-esteem.
I struggled with that for years. I still do.

351
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:44,683
But the only difference
between the two of us,

352
00:19:44,776 --> 00:19:47,668
is that I was smart enough to know that
it's never too late to come back from.

353
00:19:49,706 --> 00:19:53,865
- I can't be what I used to be.
- I don't even know that guy.

354
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:57,752
I know this guy, and I like him.

355
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:00,475
Ok, let me ask you something.

356
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:06,587
I keep working on my rehab,
and I get my act together.

357
00:20:07,564 --> 00:20:10,277
You think someone like you
could go for someone like me?

358
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:13,179
Yeah!

359
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:30,347
If you are ever single, I' m looking you up.

360
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:32,595
I hope you do.
