1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,345
It's always nice when someone from
Carla's family comes to town....

2
00:00:04,346 --> 00:00:06,466
Mostly because she cleans our apartment.

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,592
Why is there a pancake
in the silverware drawer?

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:11,803
You mean, why is there silverware
in the pancake drawer? Wuhuh!!

5
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,058
Hey, those nuts are for my
brother, please don't eat 'em all!

6
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:19,728
Baby, why you makin' such a big deal
about your brother coming, anyway?

7
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,353
He's my baby brother! I
practically raised him!

8
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:24,232
Now, I want you to try and
get along with him this time?

9
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,122
If you do, I promise to
fulfill that fantasy of yours

10
00:00:27,123 --> 00:00:29,697
but not with the weird outfit, and none of those crazy toys.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,240
So we'd just have normal sex....

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,282
If I'm not sleepy!

13
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:32,950
Deal.

14
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,537
What's up with you and her brother, anyway?
Did something happen at her mother's funeral?

15
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:44,586
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Just so you know, this is a rental and
I got the mileage right up here, so no joy-rides, comprende?

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,340
Turk! This is my brother, Marco!

17
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,468
Sorry for your loss....

18
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,055
I mean, who wears a vest
to a funeral, anyway, man?

19
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,725
The amazing thing wasn't that
Carla's brother hated Turk...

20
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,768
Marco!!!

21
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,019
Carla!!!

22
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,816
...it was that he was able to keep it up
without even speaking the same language.

23
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,484
Okay.

24
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,652
Esta J.D.

25
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,904
Y te conoce Turk.

26
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,906
What's happening?

27
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:15,659
Jackass.

28
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,163
Dude, you were wearin' a vest! Vesto!

29
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,625
Still, I had my own problems.

30
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,264
Even though she had a boyfriend,
I was still crazy about Elliot.

31
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:29,174
And, God bless her, she
wasn't making it any easier.

32
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:30,382
Hey.

33
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:30,507
What are you doing?

34
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,594
All the beds are taken. Scoot.

35
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:34,928
Bunk with The Todd!

36
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,723
J.D., you know that
he is a sleep humper.

37
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:42,019
Sometimes when I'm banging this mattress,
I'm thinking about banging that one!

38
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:50,823
Hello? ... Sean!? Where are you? ...

39
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:55,867
The west coast of New Zealand? I'm in
the on-call room! ... Hey, J.D.'s here!

40
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:56,575
J.D., say hi!

41
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,453
Uh!?

42
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,787
Oh! You wanted to keep talking?

43
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,917
How are you supposed to get over someone
when you have to be around them all the time?

44
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,254
This night could not get any worse.

45
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,760
Todd! You're having a dream! Wake up!

46
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,054
Dude, I am awake.


48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,777
I'm having second thoughts
about our giant nanny.

49
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:15,613
She's lovely and all, but every time the fridge is
empty, she looks at our son like he's a plate of ribs.

50
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:19,449
Well, you shoulda let me hire the really skinny model.
At least if she ate Jack, she'd throw him up right after.

51
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,828
I got board meetings all day, but
I'll see you for dinner tonight.

52
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,453
Bye, wife

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,664
Rreowr.

54
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,749
Doug! Doug!

55
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,834
I don't wanna be a doctor!

56
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,503
Awww.

57
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,590
Fine. I'm gonna go ahead
and tell you how it ends:

58
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,697
Dr. Phil says, "And how...is
that working out...for you?"

59
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:43,808
And the big fat lady cries, "Wah."

60
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:51,815
All right, I'm sure you're wondering why I accepted the position
of residency director considering my disdain for, well...all of you.

61
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:54,300
Is it the extra four dollars
a week in my paycheck?

62
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,781
Or is it the fact that I finally have a chance to
make a difference in this God-forsaken hell-hole.

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,616
It's all about the
four dollars, trust me.

64
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:07,874
And seeing as my money is contingent on
you lemmings actually doing your jobs,

65
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:10,990
I would say that now is a pretty good
time for you to scurry on back to work

66
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:15,501
so that I can continue to afford the
antidepressants that keep me so damn jolly.

67
00:04:17,234 --> 00:04:17,759
GO!!!

68
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,094
Say, Angela....

69
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,056
Oh, I think he means me, Angela.

70
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,641
I wonder what I did now.

71
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:30,362
Lookit, this new gig is a great opportunity
for me, and I--I want it to go well.

72
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:33,800
And, for some reason, all these other
bobble-heads seem to look up to you,

73
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:38,275
so it would make my life one hell of a
lot easier if you got in line behind me.

74
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,238
No problem.

75
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,410
I guess people can surprise you.

76
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:46,828
We'd still die.

77
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,455
We'd still what?

78
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,847
If the elevator cable snapped,

79
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:52,300
even if we timed it out perfectly
and jumped up right before impact,

80
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:53,342
we'd still be crushed to death.

81
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:55,169
I wish I'd taken the stairs.

82
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:55,963
Me too.

83
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,633
Sorry, sometimes I just have this
inner monologue running through my head.

84
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,010
Inner monologue? Weirdo!

85
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,097
That's my floor.

86
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,724
Lucky bastard.

87
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:15,983
Look, Mr. Shiny Head over there
is pretending not to watch us.

88
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,861
You say something and I'll laugh
so he thinks we're mocking him.

89
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,529
Marco, I'm not going to do that.

90
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,453
That's enough.

91
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:32,332
What'd I miss?

92
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,001
It's come to my attention...

93
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,502
Something's come to his attention.

94
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,829
...that some family members of our
critically ill patients have been complaining

95
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,289
because of the relatively small amount of
time you all spend with their loved ones.

96
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,346
'Course, in Dr. Murphy's case
that's probably a good thing.

97
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:50,726
Sir, if I could just take this chance to
explain my disturbingly high mortality rate?

98
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,853
Why don't I do that for
you? You're a bad doctor.

99
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:56,605
Now, complaints are just a
stone's throw away from lawsuits,

100
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,962
so from this point on, I don't care
how bleak a patient's prognosis is --

101
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:04,518
you are going to give each and every
one of them the same amount of your time.

102
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:11,038
Unfortunately, our new residency
director felt a little differently.

103
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,476
Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead.

104
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:19,000
And, oh my goodness, if we don't have
somebody here that we might be able to help.

105
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:23,000
Miss Bartow is thirty-six, she is
septic, and she is in respiratory failure.

106
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:27,579
Dr. Weiss, I want you to draw three sets
of surveillance cultures. Mr. Murphy--

107
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,264
Dr. Murphy?

108
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,311
...Just go ahead and get a steady BG.

109
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:37,250
We are going to try to wean
her off of the vent today,

110
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:40,356
so I want all of you people to
give her most of your attention.

111
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,446
I say we listen to Dr. Cox,
and do exactly what he says.

112
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,282
That's unbelievable.

113
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,536
But, Dr. Cox, earlier today Dr.
Kelso was telling us that he wants--

114
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:54,000
Ugssshhhhh. I don't ever want to hear
anything that's come out of that man's mouth;

115
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:58,100
unless, of course, it's "Oh, my God! I'm
dying. Now I'm moving towards the light.

116
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:59,899
But wait a minute,
there's been a mistake!

117
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,500
This is Hell! Hello, Hitler. Hello,
Mussolini. Captain Kangaroo? That's weird!"

118
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:11,265
Don't you see, Barbie, I would rather listen to
you go on and on about the joys of dolphin sex.

119
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,476
Dolphin trainer sex. My
boyfriend is a dolphin trainer.

120
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:19,606
Here that's a shame, because the whole dolphin
thing used to make you so interesting. Too bad.

121
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:20,732
We are moving on!

122
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,484
You heard him, people! We're moving on!

123
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,319
Oh, God help me.

124
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,737
...God help him!

125
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,410
My God, is there a
sexier woman in the world?

126
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,246
Mm. I gotta go --
my chin hair is back.

127
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:37,457
Ohhhh, I wish she'd cut
it off and give it to me.

128
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,584
Oh, GOD!

129
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:42,713
I don't mind it at the movies, sitting
alone. But eating alone is sad and pathetic.

130
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,131
Are you stalking me?

131
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:47,593
Nooo. My sister just had a baby,
so I'm doing the whole aunt thing.

132
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:50,387
Plus, it's a really great excuse
to run away from a relationship.

133
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:54,224
My boyfriend just dumped me, so of
course now I love him more than ever.

134
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:56,435
So, is there any chance of
you guys getting back together?

135
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,563
Well, he's engaged, and he's getting
married in two weeks...but, yeah, I think so.

136
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,274
Unrequited love sucks, you know.

137
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,152
Yeah, it does. You know
what we need to do? Uhh...?

138
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:05,819
Danni.

139
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:06,320
J.D.

140
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:06,778
Hi!

141
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,500
Hi. Danni, we need to move on, okay?

142
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:10,710
No more thinking about our exes; no
more waiting for the phone to ring;

143
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:14,150
no more stealing her purse just so you can return
it later in the hopes that she'll be so grateful,

144
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:17,478
she'll use the money recovered to buy you
a drink and maybe have sex with you after.

145
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,499
Did that work?

146
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,793
I stole the wrong purse. ...And, yes!

147
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,799
Ahh, Mr. Blinky.

148
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,092
Te quela.(?)

149
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:29,676
Sí.

150
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,846
Oh, hey Turk, why don't you
play the next game with Marco?

151
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,139
Baby, I--I
hate PacMan.

152
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,976
Really? Because you have
bed-sheets that indicate otherwise.

153
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,144
Fine, ask him.

154
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,563
Marco, can Turk play
the next game with you?

155
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:45,526
I don't want to be friends with
your stupid, melon-headed boyfriend.

156
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,278
Baby, I don't understand why
he just doesn't learn English.

157
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,534
I bet he's whining about how I don't speak English
even though he's never bothered to learn Spanish.

158
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:58,622
He's trying to learn. He's already
got 'yes', 'no', and 'cheese'.

159
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,175
Hey! Somebody say
something about cheese?

160
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:03,920
'Cause if you gonna make a
cheese run, holla at me, dawg!

161
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:08,821
Baby, when we left the Dominican Republic,
Marco never wanted to learn English.

162
00:09:08,822 --> 00:09:10,611
He even went to boarding
school in Puerto Rico.

163
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:15,800
Imagine what it's like to constantly feel like an
outsider just because you're proud of your heritage.

164
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,433
But did you or did you not
say something about cheese?

165
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:20,769
God, darn you!

166
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,500
Miss Bartow's systemic
vascular resistance is falling,

167
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,652
so the next couple hours
are gonna be crucial, okay?

168
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:32,750
Perry, the fact that these residents are spending
most of their time buzzing around that one patient

169
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:35,942
makes me think that you told them
to disobey a direct order from me.

170
00:09:35,945 --> 00:09:40,910
Bob Kelso, that's just not true. Here, I told
them to disregard all direct orders from you.

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,363
I know you all think of me
as some heartless monster;

172
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:52,302
still, if your grandmother were here, wouldn't you want her
doctor to spend as much time with her as he does with anyone else?

173
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:56,847
Grandma Dorian or Nana Hobbs? Because
Nana Hobbs can be an eensy bit racist.

174
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:57,806
Grandma Dorian.

175
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:58,473
She's dead.

176
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:04,097
The point is, sometimes what's best for this
hospital is what's best for the patients!

177
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:07,608
I know it, you know it, and
guess what, Dr. Cox knows it, too.

178
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,696
Although damned if he doesn't disagree
with me just because I said it.

179
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,196
Sir, I don't think that's true.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,700
Perry! It's hotter than hell in here!

181
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:15,200
Freezing!

182
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,617
Great coffee, though!

183
00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:17,250
Rat piss!

184
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,578
Dr. Murphy is an incompetent suck-up.

185
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,290
No, Bob. In fact, he's one of the finest young
doctors I've ever had the good fortune of working with.

186
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,416
Your witness.

187
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,961
What are you doing?

188
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,297
I'm calling my dad!!!

189
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,428
Hey!

190
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,846
Oh! Hey, how are you?

191
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,432
Good. So, I did it
-- I talked to my ex.

192
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,016
And...?

193
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,881
And I said, "Congratulations
on the wedding,

194
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:45,396
and I hope you two stay happy,
and, by the way, size does matter."

195
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,250
See! That's what happens when you
finally have the courage to cut the cord!

196
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:50,500
Before you know it, you'll be
ready for someone new to come along.

197
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,700
Hey, you wanna go grab a cup of coffee?

198
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:55,030
Ooh, I can't. I got something
really important to do.

199
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,371
Thanks, J.D. I am so tense.
Someone stole my purse!

200
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:04,540
It'll turn up....

201
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,919
Once the dynamic of a relationship
is established, it rarely changes.

202
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:12,965
Cheese?

203
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:15,801
Man, I am so sick of you.

204
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:21,139
I'm sorry, but
I...can't...understand...you!

205
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:25,477
Yeah? Well, that talking slower and louder
thing is not as helpful as you might think.

206
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:27,771
Geez! Can you believe this guy?

207
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,691
Don't get me started.

208
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:37,114
Of course, if the dynamic does change,
it's never as simple as you'd hope.

209
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:42,250
Hey, Newbie, listen, I got dinner plans
with Jordan, and seeing as you're on-call,

210
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:45,250
whatta you say you pull up a chair,
here, in front of Miss Bartow?

211
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,410
...Especially when it involves someone
who's used to you following their lead.

212
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:53,881
Look, Dr. Cox, I'll take care of her, and I'll have my interns
help, but you gotta know I have other patients, too, so....

213
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,250
Maybe you didn't understand
me, there, Violet.

214
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:01,750
I don't want you leaving her side, even if someone
thinks they saw Justin Timberlake downstairs.

215
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:04,185
Now, dammit all, are you
falling in line with me or not?

216
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:06,435
I don't think so.

217
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:08,979
Okay, then.

218
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:25,078
It was a strange feeling not doing what Dr.
Cox wanted me to do. Still, I knew I was right.

219
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:31,668
Oh, God, if Jordan knew I was the reason Dr. Cox canceled dinner
tonight, she'd give me the stink-eye and then twist my nurples off.

220
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,796
Calm down, tiger. She doesn't know.

221
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:37,716
She knows! She knows!

222
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:43,350
Don't worry, guys. I'd
never let her hurt you.

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,768
I'm going to grab my stuff and we'll go.

224
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,770
Baby! There you are. He speaks English!

225
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,188
Who?

226
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:54,525
Your brother; he speaks English.
Yo, tell her you speak English!

227
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:54,690
What?

228
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,945
Don't "que" my-- "Que,"
my ass! "Que," my ass!

229
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,989
You were there, and you saw the
whole thing. Now you tell her.

230
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

231
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:07,037
Turk, I would know if my
own brother speaks English!

232
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,164
Let's go, Marco.

233
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,500
J.D.! You know all those pictures
of us from when we were going out?

234
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:18,883
Do you still have those?

235
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,385
Filed alphabetically
in my "Elliot Cabinet".

236
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,387
I don't know.... I might.... Why?

237
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:27,516
Well, you know the picture of us at the beach, where I
actually look good and you think that you look like Bjork?

238
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:28,183
Yeah.

239
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:32,770
Well, I was hoping you wouldn't mind if I cut you out
of it, and used it in a collage that I'm making for Sean?

240
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,523
No problem!

241
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:35,816
Thanks!

242
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,655
Whoa.

243
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,740
How's the whole moving on thing going?

244
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,411
It's going great,
Danni! In opposite world!

245
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,171
Well, I just wanted to say goodbye.

246
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:54,919
I was gonna stick around for a few more days, but I don't
really feel like that there's a reason to. ...Is there?

247
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:56,545
Probably not.

248
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:00,591
I'm gonna miss you.

249
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:03,468
I'm gonna miss you, too.

250
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,304
Dude, we just met
-- I was kidding.

251
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,099
Oh! That was good! No! No,
I was doing the same thing!

252
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,309
Adios.

253
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,186
Drive safe.

254
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:18,500
Hey, Barbie. How's about
you sashay on over here,

255
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:23,823
push those rock & roll bangs out of your face, and
keep those peepers on Miss Bartow's hemodynamics!

256
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:29,953
Oh, first I've gotta discharge Mr. Hale, then get a _____ on Mrs. Peterson,
and then, to be perfectly frank, perform a thong extrication on Ms. Reid.

257
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,748
Hey, your last name is Reid!

258
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,102
Doug. I have underwear in my butt.

259
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,921
After that, though, I'll
totally swing back by here.

260
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,148
You're losing them!

261
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:48,925
Oh, don't get me wrong, you had me worried there was
gonna be a bunch of young Dr. Coxes roaming the halls,

262
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:53,094
calling me "Bobbo", shaving my genitals
when I pass out at the Christmas party....

263
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,229
Tradition is tradition, Bob.

264
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,750
Yeah.... Then I remembered that
you've been here over ten years,

265
00:14:58,751 --> 00:15:01,338
and there's not a single
disciple of yours to be found.

266
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,801
And you know why?

267
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:05,948
You told 'em this exact same
story and bored 'em to death?

268
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:14,203
No. It's because eventually they all start questioning the
gospel according to Cox, 

268
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,918
and you can't handle that. Can you?

269
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:26,385
Hey, jackass.

270
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:30,180
Hello, Marc. I'm guessing
Carla's not around.

271
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:33,559
She's in the bathroom,
cepillar sus dientes.

272
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,750
Hey, baby. Gimme some
of that minty breath.

273
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:40,050
Noooooo, not in front of my brother --
that stuff always makes him uncomfortable.

274
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:49,992
Oh, really? I just wanted to apologize for the way I've
been acting by loving you up and down, and all around!

275
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:50,534
Turk!

276
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:54,580
Baby, he can't understand you! Now let's go
put some more of your footprints on the ceiling!

277
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,664
That's it, you son of a bitch!!!

278
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:56,331
I told ya!

279
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:06,341
So black people can get black
eyes, too, huh? Who knew?

280
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,803
I haven't had one this bad since
your Nana Hobbs threw that rock at me.

281
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,638
She thought you were robbing the house.

282
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:15,267
J.D.! Did you hear, Miss
Bartow's completely stabilized!

283
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,478
I don't wanna see you
around here anymore, okay?

284
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,981
All right, come on you
guys, you all got work to do!

285
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:24,735
Newbie, maybe I wasn't clear enough
with you on Miss Bartow over there.

286
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,500
Here it comes. I'm incompetent.
I'm a girl. I'm a little girl.

287
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:29,991
I'm a little girl with
pigtails that rides a tricycle.

288
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:33,547
No. Well...yes, but I am honestly trying to tell you

288
00:16:33,632 --> 00:16:37,247
that I don't think I was being clear with you before.

289
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:40,167
In fact, I think I was
being a pretty lousy teacher.

290
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:45,100
Look, I think putting one in the
"win" column every now and then

291
00:16:45,101 --> 00:16:46,136
is what gives us the juice 

291
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:50,136
to keep plugging along
in games that we know deep down we're not gonna win.

292
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,348
And that's why I locked in
so intensely to that patient.

293
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:59,770
Because opportunities, they...God,
they come along so rarely in this place.

294
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:08,111
And when they do, you just can't let them slip
through your fingers. You cannot. You know?

295
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,575
I think I do.

296
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,500
I wasn't sure what I was hoping for. ...

297
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,225
That somehow Danni had
decided not to leave...

298
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,500
that she'd snapped her
leg in the parking lot....

299
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,417
DANNI!?

300
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,043
Yo.

301
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,839
...All I knew was I'd
missed an opportunity.

302
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:34,596
So when I was a senior in high school, you heard me
talking to my friends in English about going on the pill?

303
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:38,308
No, I just learned
English a few years ago.

304
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:43,647
Well, good, because I wasn't on the pill, and
I'm not now. I've never had sex. I hope it's fun.

305
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,235
Why didn't you tell me?

306
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,820
I don't know.

307
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,739
Mom died, and now
you're getting married.

308
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:59,830
You and I have always had a special connection.
I guess I just didn't want to lose that.

309
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,749
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

310
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,501
Sorry, sweetie.

311
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,714
Sorry...s-sweetie.

312
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:13,969
And Turk, you don't mind if every now and then
Marco and I speak Spanish to each other, right?

313
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:22,811
Baby, fo'shizzle-dizzle. Do your thizzle,
'cause I'm up out this pizzle. Chach!

314
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,272
See, we got our own secret
language, too. Eh-ha!

315
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,192
What did he say?

316
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,651
I have no idea.

317
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,987
Jackass!

318
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,700
No one knew her last name, no
one even remembered seeing her.

319
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,270
I started to wonder if Danni was even
real. I guess that's the thing about life.

320
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:44,200
You don't
really--

321
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,011
Hey, J.D.

322
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,800
Excuse me!

323
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,213
You don't really get many second chances.

324
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:53,800
Oh! Danni! Hi! I'm sorry, sometimes I have
this inner monologue running through my head.

325
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:54,843
Oh.

326
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,386
Weirdo!

327
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,932
I'm having dinner with my sister tonight,
but I swear I'm leaving after that.

328
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,018
Don't. Stay here with me,
we'll get that cup of coffee.

329
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,395
I'm not gonna stick around
for one cup of coffee.

330
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,356
Okay, two cups...and some pie.

331
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:10,901
Finally, I found a girl
with no complications.

332
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:13,320
Oh, I see you've met my sister!

333
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,492
Oh, come on.
