1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,298
Hey, Chocolate Bear.

2
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:03,934
I didn't have time to shower this morning.
Did you wax your dome?

3
00:00:03,975 --> 00:00:05,582
I sure did!
Why?

4
00:00:11,987 --> 00:00:13,820
- Thanks, pal!
- Uh-huh...

5
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:15,098
Hold up!

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,378
Chapped!

7
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,782
Easy, Moose, that stuff is forty bucks a tin.

8
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:24,716
"With the long hours at a hospital, you don't
have time to worry about your appearance."

9
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:29,701
"It may sound sexist, but with the female
doctors, it's slightly more noticeable."

10
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:32,831
Hey, Janice.
Is it windy out?

11
00:00:32,873 --> 00:00:35,591
No. Why do you always ask me that!?

12
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:38,887
Because I'm--I'm captain of
m-m-my kite-flying team?

13
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:41,317
The M-m-mighty Kites?

14
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:45,787
"Agh! Okay, just say something innocuous."

15
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:47,373
Good morning, gentlemen.

16
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:49,989
"The truth is most of them
don't even bother trying."

17
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,254
- "Except of course..."
- Hey, girlfriends!

18
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:56,436
How do you have the time to look
so good every morning?

19
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:13,613
Oh, this? Heh.
Yeah, it doesn't take long.

20
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:18,227
"I guess everyone has their
morning routines."

21
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:23,686
Hi, cutie! Since you have so many balls and...

22
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:26,549
too many toys can be
over-stimulating for an infant,

23
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,844
Brantley here was wondering if he
could borrow one to play with!

24
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:33,835
Oh, that's funny, because Jack here was
just wondering why the crazy lady...

25
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:37,479
who just spent the last hour chain smoking
and talking on her cell phone while...

26
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:42,429
her kid ate sand would come over to two complete
strangers and give them parenting advice!

27
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:45,560
He also thanked me for not naming him "Brantley"!

28
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:47,269
Y-yeah.

29
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:52,027
I love our family.

30
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:57,549
'Married With Children'?
Awesome!

31
00:01:57,573 --> 00:01:59,792
- Has Kelly been on yet?
- Here she comes.

32
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:01,353
"Hi, Daddy!"

33
00:02:02,316 --> 00:02:04,289
Anyway, where's Danni?
We're gonna be late for our movie.

34
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:09,349
Stop. Lemme just go
grab a sweater.

35
00:02:09,432 --> 00:02:11,463
I love you...

36
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:14,468
Wow, she's using the "L" word now.

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,030
Yeeeaaah, but we're not
really that serious.

38
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:18,860
This isn't the movies?

39
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,321
I just wanted you to see this.

40
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,721
Because if I move here permanently, this
would be the type of place we could afford.

41
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:37,635
Out of body experience?

42
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,815
Yeah.

43
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:40,943
She wants to move in together.
I have to break up with her!

44
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,103
Dude, relax.
Enjoy the show.

45
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,014
Have a Bugle.

46
00:02:46,198 --> 00:02:47,948
Ooh, your ghost hands is cold!

47
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:49,921
J.D.!?

48
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:53,916
I wanted to put them on my fingers
and pretend I had witch nails.

49
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,036
- What?!
- Nothing.

50
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:21,062
I just can't believe how comfortable I've gotten
talking to you over these last few months.

51
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:24,226
I mean, look, I'd still be with
my old shrink if I hadn't...

52
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:27,481
cut across the park the day of the
renaissance faire and realized...

53
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:30,578
that the man I tell my innermost
secrets to likes to...

54
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:35,016
likes to put on a big, giant beard and make
pretend that he is a blacksmith.

55
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,425
A-a-a-anyway, something weird's
been going on with me lately.

56
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:43,331
I have been sleeping more, I've
been drinking alone... less...

57
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,501
I've even started complimenting people.

58
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,410
Oh, come on!
Get your pump on!

59
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,080
God help me, Sluggo, if you get any more buff,
I'll be absolutely sure that you're gay!

60
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:54,821
Oh, I'm gonna get more buff!

61
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:00,818
Dr. Cox never compliments
me about anything!

62
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:02,337
Well, he should.

63
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:05,059
Your new look has completely
changed my perspective.

64
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:09,330
For instance, this is not a broom
with fraying edges...

65
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:12,575
this is now a broom that reminds
me of blonde doctor's bangs.

66
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,873
Tough and spunky!

67
00:04:14,883 --> 00:04:18,177
Oh, my God! That is exactly the
look that I was going for!

68
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,574
- Really!?
- Yeah!

69
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,322
Shoobity-doo! Hey!

70
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:26,285
How 'bout I give you a ride
to your next destination?

71
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,319
To the morgue!

72
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:34,018
- Watch it!
- Hey!

73
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:37,520
So, did you break up with her?

74
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,423
I was going to last night...

75
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:42,391
but then I looked in her eyes,
and I realized how rare...

76
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:45,607
it is to meet someone who's actually
willing to have sex with me.

77
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:48,033
How did you have sex with the woman
you're about to break up with?

78
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:51,436
Okay, you know how the, uh, couch in
the living room has those high arms?

79
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:52,807
Babe, you gotta understand,

80
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:56,377
a guy will sleep with any woman he finds
attractive, no matter how he feels about her.

81
00:04:56,397 --> 00:05:00,618
If Tyra Banks drove her car over my mom
and then offered to have sex with me?

82
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:04,090
I'd have to dial 9-1-1 in the nude because
my pants would already be off!

83
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:06,920
That's sweet! While your mother
lays there dying!

84
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:09,228
- Tell her.
- His mom doesn't die.

85
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:11,704
Tyra uses her connections in the
supermodel world to get...

86
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:15,718
government scientists to put Turk's mom's
brain into Heidi Klum's body.

87
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:18,707
She falls in love with me,
we all move in together.

88
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,706
It'd be awkward at first,
but I'd make it work...

89
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:23,905
'Cause I love my mom.

90
00:05:23,984 --> 00:05:26,104
Mm, and I would love her, too.

91
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:28,245
New low.

92
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,605
Oh, Mrs. Gorski,
I know shingles are never fun.

93
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,338
Unless you're talking about the games we made
up the summer my parents got a new roof.

94
00:05:37,358 --> 00:05:40,987
It was kind of like Hide & Seek, only
we'd throw shingles at each other?

95
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:43,640
Ahh, summer time... Still...

96
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,389
a positive attitude can go a long way in helping
you feel better, so let's see a big ol' smile!

97
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:51,876
Excuse me.
Can I borrow Dr. Reid?

98
00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:53,859
You may keep her.

99
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,908
Here at Sacred Heart, I like to think that
our patients choose our hospital...

100
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:03,110
not only because I leak vicious rumors about
competing hospitals to the press,

101
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,966
but also because when they see
one of our doctors they think,

102
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:09,343
"Now that's a professional!"

103
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:12,479
Um, I don't think I look
unprofessional.

104
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:16,813
I've let this whole new look thing
slide the last few months,

105
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:19,216
but now that your colleagues
are beginning to complain

106
00:06:19,226 --> 00:06:22,559
I'm going to give you the same advice
I give my son every morning.

107
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:26,356
Lose the makeup!
Get a haircut!

108
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,276
And stop using my razor to
shave your fun zone!

109
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:37,216
- I hate missing practice.
- Me too.

110
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:40,312
Mighty Kiiiiites!

111
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:42,009
Morning, class.

112
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:45,266
As residency director, it is my
pleasure to have both surgical...

113
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:48,167
and medical personnel here with us today.

114
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:51,684
In fact, in this room we have enough
brain power to light up a city!

115
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:55,548
Not a real city, mind you, but...
definitely a tiny ant city...

116
00:06:55,549 --> 00:07:00,088
whose government has recently passed a
series of stringent energy conservation laws!

117
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:02,287
Stringent what?

118
00:07:02,977 --> 00:07:05,256
"Stringent updoc".

119
00:07:05,354 --> 00:07:06,913
It's happening.

120
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:08,895
Yes, Nervous Guy?

121
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:10,621
What's "updoc"?

122
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:14,428
Okay, people, biphasic defibrillators.

123
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:17,703
How many of you had a chance
to practice on the mannequin?

124
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:20,245
Oh, yeah.

125
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:22,190
With the defibrillator...?

126
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,970
And I assume none of you have
even looked at the literature.

127
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:32,877
I didn't do anything. No yelling,
no breaking stuff, nothing.

128
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:34,548
And right then...

129
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:36,699
I figured out what's different.

130
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:40,605
I figured out what that feeling was that I was
having in the park the other day with my family.

131
00:07:40,713 --> 00:07:42,419
I'm...

132
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:44,372
happy.

133
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,788
Now does that not just make you sick?

134
00:07:49,422 --> 00:07:51,514
Dude, with Danni you just gotta
keep your eyes on the prize.

135
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:54,985
Focus in on how great it is
to be single! Chasing tail!

136
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:56,475
Hell, I miss it every day.

137
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:58,664
Oh, you don't care if you ever
have sex again, do you?

138
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:01,041
Baby, listen, I'm just trying
to keep my man psyched,

139
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:03,645
'cause since I've known J.D.,
he's never broken up with anyone.

140
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:05,568
He's right. I don't like hurting people.

141
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:07,511
But with Danni, I'm gonna
do the honorable thing...

142
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:11,220
I'm gonna have someone in a fireman's
outfit tell her I burned to death.

143
00:08:11,318 --> 00:08:15,875
Bambi, you owe her closure. Hell, you owe
it to every woman you've ever dated.

144
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:19,011
Listen, Danni....

145
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,221
Lisa....

146
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:25,215
Drunk girl who was friends with the girl
I really wanted to hook up with...

147
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:27,563
It's not all of you.

148
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:29,249
It's me.

149
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,445
Scott Gerber?!

150
00:08:32,474 --> 00:08:35,364
At soccer camp, I told you I wanted
to be more than friends.

151
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:37,465
I thought you meant teammates!

152
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:39,793
Well, I didn't!

153
00:08:40,325 --> 00:08:42,397
He used to...
borrow my jersey and...

154
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:45,080
wear it as jammies...

155
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,175
Hey, Danni, it's me.
What are you up to?

156
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:53,569
- I'm keeping busy.
- "Oh, that's great."

157
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:55,824
Uh, listen, something's been on my mind...

158
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:56,775
"Me too."

159
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,873
I just feel like my life is so scattered lately and
you're the only good thing I have going right now.

160
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:02,963
- Awesome.
- How's he doing?

161
00:09:02,998 --> 00:09:04,959
The boy's got no biscuits.

162
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:07,108
I am trying to break someone's
heart here, okay!?

163
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:09,984
I'm feeling really bummed.
Do you have a second to talk?

164
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:14,411
Actually, I'm kinda swamped right now,
uh, let me get back to you, okay?

165
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:17,029
Elliot, what's wrong?

166
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,341
- Eh, forget it, you're busy.
- Come on!

167
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,395
I always have time for you!

168
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:26,082
Have the other doctors been making
fun of the way I look?

169
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:28,008
- What? No! No way!
- Huh? I've never heard anything...

170
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:29,288
- ...like that! Why?
- Why would you say that?

171
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:30,967
Hell, yeah.

172
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,136
Only the girl ones, and you know,
they're all "Mrreeeoww!!"

173
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:38,212
- Cat fight?
- Sorry, Todd!

174
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:41,734
Let's try and be a little more careful
when we use that noise, okay?

175
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:43,225
God!

176
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,985
Honestly, I haven't been this
happy since Christmas...

177
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:50,581
when I was seven years old and my father
showed me how to make a snow angel.

178
00:09:51,197 --> 00:09:53,898
Actually, he was passed out
drunk in the yard but...

179
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:58,336
I did take his arms and his legs and
move them back and forth... and...

180
00:09:58,454 --> 00:10:02,023
th-the paramedics said it was one of the finest
snow angels that they'd ever seen, so...

181
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:05,863
maybe the fact that I am the kinder, gentler...

182
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:09,056
Cox is every last bit of okay.
Maybe it's a...

183
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,276
a natural progression.

184
00:10:11,323 --> 00:10:14,857
It's not like there's any real ramifications...

185
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,252
Right?

186
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:22,207
What the hell, there, Pee-Pants?
Are you... the only one here?

187
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,772
I drew the short straw, so
I have to press record on...

188
00:10:24,783 --> 00:10:26,798
all the tape players when
you start the lecture.

189
00:10:27,056 --> 00:10:29,076
Of course you do, but you
don't actually expect me--

190
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:38,786
Where is everybody?

191
00:10:38,857 --> 00:10:41,804
They all had really important things to do?

192
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:44,997
Hello, citizens!

193
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:46,841
Welcome to Sacred Heart!

194
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:50,035
Home of the world's most giant doctor!

195
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:53,534
Be not afraid!
I'm just like you!

196
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:55,577
Except I'm giant!

197
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,312
My tush is chafing.

198
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,799
All right! My turn to get on top!

199
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:04,477
Turk, we tried playing Giant Black Guy.
Remember what happened?

200
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:06,015
- People ran.
- Damn!

201
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,140
Besides, I gotta go deal with
this whole Danni thing.

202
00:11:08,163 --> 00:11:10,183
You want me to just talk
to her for you? I'll do it.

203
00:11:10,282 --> 00:11:12,128
Nah, that's weak. I mean, if someone
doesn't care about you enough...

204
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,879
to break up with you themselves, it's
like they didn't ever care about you at all.

205
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:16,195
Hey, guys.

206
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:18,625
Ohh! J.D., Danni's
breaking up with you.

207
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,232
Mm, darn. See ya!

208
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,075
What?

209
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,798
Guys, how many times do I have to tell you?
Stop wearing my coat!

210
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,487
Sorry about that, Chet!

211
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:39,397
Which one of these is Chet's?
We gotta put this coat back.

212
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:41,287
Oh... I think it's this one.

213
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:44,340
Dude, look at the size of this Odor-Eater!
We could surf on it!

214
00:11:44,351 --> 00:11:47,099
I still don't understand why Danni's breaking
up with me, man. I gotta go talk to her.

215
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,796
Okay, first of all, words cannot describe
the smell that is currently on my cheek.

216
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:55,000
You get out clean, and now you wanna go
back in just 'cause she rejected you?

217
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:56,914
Who else is that crazy?

218
00:11:58,242 --> 00:12:00,825
Not one resident showed up.

219
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,126
Not one. Would you like to know why?

220
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:06,414
Because they're not scared
of me anymore.

221
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,891
And I blame you... yes.

222
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,099
You have turned me into this soft,

223
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:15,725
emotionally open, pathetic freak at home,
and now it's starting to bleed over into work.

224
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:22,818
- "...Happy birthday to you!"
- "And many more!"

225
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,330
Oh, my... oh, my God!

226
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:27,073
Happy birthday!

227
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:29,985
Oh, dammit, people, I've been
here twenty-three years.

228
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:32,539
For the last time,
I'm allergic to coconut!

229
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:36,438
Elliot... Have you been in the
supply closet, crying?

230
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:38,845
Carla... I don't do that anymore!

231
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:44,282
Oh, my God! I look like Alice Cooper!

232
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:47,453
You know, I shouldn't have to feel
bad for wanting to look good.

233
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:51,045
You don't, what with your
bohemian scarves and...

234
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:54,567
- pirate earrings.
- Thank you for noticing.

235
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,902
But still, it's different for nurses,
we're not judged for being feminine.

236
00:12:57,984 --> 00:12:59,628
But when you're a doctor,

237
00:12:59,675 --> 00:13:02,366
if you put in too much effort the men
will never take you seriously...

238
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:04,899
and the women will think you're
trying to show them up.

239
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,739
It's a dumb stereotype. You just have
to decide if it's worth the hassle.

240
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:18,637
Laverne!

241
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,574
Good cake, though.

242
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:23,804
Hellooo?

243
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:27,976
Little piece of advice:

244
00:13:27,998 --> 00:13:30,491
Your honker's cute in person.
Peep-hole? Not your friend.

245
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:34,659
Ha! I'm sorry, did I interrupt you
from trying to eat your baby?

246
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:37,024
Danni's not here.

247
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:38,926
Look, do you know how hard
it was for me to come here?

248
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,172
- Gotcha!
- Oooog! Oh, God...

249
00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:45,427
Not getting up until you
come to your senses.

250
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:47,411
Get your coffee on, dawg.

251
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,904
Say what you want, those big round
cheeks are warm in the morning...

252
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:54,896
What?

253
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,995
I just wanna know why
she broke up with me.

254
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:59,893
Well, why don't you just...
hey! Ask her yourself!

255
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:04,975
Not cool.

256
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:08,595
Now, there you go, sweetheart!

257
00:14:08,618 --> 00:14:11,699
Now you look more like a doctor
and less like a lap-dance!

258
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:14,702
Thank you, sir.

259
00:14:17,954 --> 00:14:19,805
Floor's wet.

260
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:22,750
You know, I liked the way
blonde-haired doctor looked.

261
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:26,529
She brightened my day.
But you don't care, do ya?

262
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,084
'Cause you're unconscious.

263
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:32,029
So I...

264
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:35,522
I'm pretty much thinking it's
time to get the fear back.

265
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,581
And I'm sorry, but I think
life is just too short to spend...

266
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:42,481
your time working someplace where people
don't crap their pants at the mere sight of ya.

267
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:46,522
Okay, listen up, people,
because this part is crucial.

268
00:14:46,523 --> 00:14:49,622
In order to use the biphasic
defibrillator, we have to--

269
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:53,088
Sorry I'm late.

270
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:57,884
Hey, Elliot.
Is it greasy outside?

271
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:03,800
Oh, that is so stupid.
Elliot, you look... smart.

272
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:07,293
- Hello?
- Of course I'm smart -- I'm a doctor!

273
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,926
"What's up, doc?"
I just got it!

274
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:12,162
Maybe that's why Danni wants to break
up with me, she thinks I'm too smart!

275
00:15:12,186 --> 00:15:13,549
You're dating a guy named Danny?

276
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,203
Is he hot?

277
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:18,035
Listen...
I know it's a cliché,

278
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:21,128
but Sander say that it is indeed
the calm before the storm...

279
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,228
that lets you know that danger's coming.

280
00:15:30,482 --> 00:15:32,541
First off, let me just say...

281
00:15:32,586 --> 00:15:33,896
thank you

282
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:37,777
For the last couple of months
I have been adrift in a sea of...

283
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:39,536
puppy dogs, lollipops,

284
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,066
and, let's face it, mediocre metaphors.

285
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,484
Luckily, you people were kind enough to...

286
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:47,820
piss all over learning a procedure that could...

287
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:51,637
determine whether some poor
sucker lives or dies, and...

288
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,883
that reminded me of something that I...

289
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:57,055
wanted to remind YOU of.

290
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:58,767
Because, you see, I...

291
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,063
am accountable.

292
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:05,585
I am accountable for the continuous,
crashing, undeniable...

293
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:10,398
amateurism that you people drag into
this hospital day in and day out.

294
00:16:11,316 --> 00:16:14,584
And believe you me when I tell you
that the next time one of you...

295
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:18,670
perpetual disappointments doesn't
even have the common decency...

296
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:22,465
to try and do better at something
you supposedly DO?

297
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,830
I will go ahead and toss your sorry
ass outta here in about...

298
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:30,956
ten seconds and then I will forget
you forever in the next five.

299
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:36,278
Okaaay!
Nervous Guy!

300
00:16:36,323 --> 00:16:38,765
Bring that nervous butt up
here, lose the shirt.

301
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:41,160
We're gonna show these good
people how this thing works.

302
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:47,004
Nice tan, there, champ.

303
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:48,556
- Thanks?
- Clear!

304
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:56,269
"After Dr. Cox exploded at us, so many
thoughts were racing through my head."

305
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:58,810
"We have been slacking off lately."

306
00:16:58,898 --> 00:17:01,484
"How did Doug get such incredible abs?"

307
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:03,588
"And what the hell is the deal with Danni?"

308
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:05,664
- Hey!
- Hey.

309
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,457
After you dressed up Rowdy, did you trim
the clumpy areas around his butt?

310
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:14,721
- Yeah...?
- Oh...

311
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:18,218
Thanks. He was due for
a good grooming.

312
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:21,039
Look...

313
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,106
- Just tell me why.
- Your cell phone wasn't turned off.

314
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:26,748
- What?
- When you called me.

315
00:17:27,498 --> 00:17:31,215
Actually I'm swamped, Danni.
Sorry, I gotta go.

316
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,774
Elliot, what's wrong?

317
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:38,569
Oh... Forget it, you're busy.

318
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:41,513
"Come on! I always have time for you!"

319
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,353
That stupid phone! You know, that's the same
way Turk found out I collect scarves!

320
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,868
- Ooooh!
- J.D.--

321
00:17:48,924 --> 00:17:52,416
You're still not over Elliot.
And until you are,

322
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:55,752
no one's ever gonna have a
chance to get close to you.

323
00:17:55,786 --> 00:17:57,196
Right?

324
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:01,718
That silence?

325
00:18:01,763 --> 00:18:03,778
That's you breaking up with me.

326
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,631
Hey! I finally broke up with someone!

327
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:30,697
- How you doing, Elliot?
- Great!

328
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,201
I figure I spend three quarters of my life in
a place filled with misery and sickness.

329
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:37,335
If I need to feel good about myself,
then the hell with everybody!

330
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,308
And for what it's worth, I think you look
beautiful, I wouldn't change a thing.

331
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:44,912
Ohh.... Oh! I did, uh, tone down
the eye makeup a little bit.

332
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:47,207
Oh, thank God! You looked so slutty.

333
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:55,088
There!
All done.

334
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,719
I look hot!

335
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:01,928
"Everybody has their own way
of getting through the day."

336
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:10,558
"For some, it's as simple as
standing up for a friend..."

337
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:13,267
"and getting away with it."

338
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:18,428
"For others, it's talking
things out with someone."

339
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,301
I--I know what you're thinking,
believe me, I...I do.

340
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:26,723
Why in the world would a civilized, up-town
man of the millennium such as myself...

341
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:30,149
even go ahead and give a good
rat's ass about whether a bunch of...

342
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,841
snot-nosed baby docs were afraid of him.

343
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:36,146
Right?
Well...

344
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:40,028
unfortunately the only way I
know how to teach is through...

345
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,532
fear.

346
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,253
And I tell YOU this because...

347
00:19:44,275 --> 00:19:47,197
I know that this particular shortcoming...

348
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,454
will invariably affect your life.

349
00:19:53,555 --> 00:19:54,887
And again,

350
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,182
sorry about the gay sailor's outfit.

351
00:19:57,215 --> 00:19:59,409
Your mother LOVES it.

352
00:19:59,454 --> 00:20:02,488
She couldn't be more pleasant when
you have it on. Take it off...

353
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:05,421
nut bag, have it on...
pleasant, approachable....

354
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:14,162
"As for me, if I'm not over Elliot, I might
as well wait it out for the long haul."

355
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,509
"After all, it doesn't mean I'm gonna
ignore opportunity if it falls in my lap."

356
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:20,330
- Hey! Sheila!
- Leave me alone.

357
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:22,703
- Okay...!
- J.D.

358
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:25,624
Let's get going. Sean's calling me
at home in like ten minutes.

359
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,512
"Oh, this is gonna suck."
