1
00:00:01,885 --> 00:00:04,177
I'm running a little late
this morning, but that's okay

2
00:00:04,177 --> 00:00:06,999
because I've been working with
Dr. Casey the last few weeks.

3
00:00:06,914 --> 00:00:09,944
You see, he has
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

4
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:12,009
and he likes to start
each day the same way...

5
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:13,978
Bink. Bink. Bink ...

6
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:16,761
...by touching everything
in his first patient's room.

7
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:20,201
Bink, bink bink, bink, bink bink...

8
00:00:22,637 --> 00:00:25,560
Bink, bink, bink, bink, bink,
bink, bink, bink, bink, bink...

9
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:26,695
Good morning, doctors.

10
00:00:26,783 --> 00:00:28,776
He touches everything.

11
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:29,538
Bink.

12
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:33,271
Oh. Okay. I suppose that's how they
say good morning in Cuckoo Town.

13
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,348
Pretty much. Bink.

14
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:38,098
Now. Your patients on this wing have
all been complaining about odd noises.

15
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:39,564
Oh, if it's a "bink" I can explain.

16
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:41,180
It isn't "bink"! Stop saying "bink"!

17
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:43,367
"I come from the land down under!

18
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:45,956
Where women glow and men plunder!"

19
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:47,215
That wasn't me.

20
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:48,897
Just figure it out, dammit!

21
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:50,332
Do you plunder?

22
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:52,175
I have been known to plunder.

23
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,737
What's that noise he's talking about?

24
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,613
That, my friends, is a roof toilet.

25
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,343
I'm sorry, you said that
like it's a normal thing.

26
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:02,950
with this guy, he's uh....

27
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:06,853
Hey! You're the guy that's
been using up all my soap!

28
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:08,072
Yeah, I've got OCD

29
00:01:08,226 --> 00:01:10,082
Really!? My grandpa had that.

30
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,499
Every morning he'd take a gym sock,

31
00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:14,267
fill it up with nickels,
and just beat us!

32
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:18,091
That's OCD, right?

33
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,156
The bad kind.

34
00:01:19,157 --> 00:01:20,905
Who would use this thing?

35
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:22,696
You kiddin'?

36
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:26,818
Oh, man! Just picture yourself, you're
standing out here, in the open air,

37
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,089
then you sit down

38
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:30,640
and you take stock of your life.

39
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:34,391
I've had some major
epiphanies on this old girl.

40
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,330
See, you can't do any soul-searching down
there on those germ-infested crappers.

41
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:40,818
Damn him. He's right.

42
00:01:41,346 --> 00:01:42,351
Listen, pal.

43
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,144
I don't want you telling
anybody about my epiphany toilet.

44
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:47,468
Who'm I gonna tell?

45
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:52,017
Ehp! Don't even think about it!

46
00:01:56,353 --> 00:01:59,487
And get this: He calls
it his "epiphany toilet"!

47
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:01,612
Yeah, you couldn't pay
me to poop on the roof.

48
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:02,737
No one's offering.

49
00:02:02,738 --> 00:02:04,009
You're like Dr. Casey.

50
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:08,321
I think he said using that
toilet would be like his Everest.

51
00:02:08,322 --> 00:02:12,134
Using that toilet would be my Everest

52
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:20,444
Yep, that's what he said.

53
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:23,635
Ask him.

54
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:23,887
Why?

55
00:02:23,888 --> 00:02:24,688
J.D.!

56
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:27,170
Turk wants to ask you something,

57
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,787
and it would mean a lot to
the both of us if you said yes.

58
00:02:31,823 --> 00:02:35,252
Oh, my God!  Would  I have a
threesome with Turk and Carla?

59
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:39,272
Well, it's certainly flattering, and
I don't think they'd tell anyone....

60
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:41,159
Will you be my best man?

61
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,185
Oh.

62
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:46,147
I mean, YEAH! Of course!

63
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:47,544
Hell yeah, you will!

64
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:48,700
Thank you so much!

65
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,610
You're my buddy! Yeah!

66
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:53,391
So is this, like, the best
moment you guys have ever had?

67
00:02:58,783 --> 00:03:00,718
A decoder ring! Heh.

68
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:05,239
TURK!

69
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,824
What?

70
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:08,230
It finally happened!

71
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,006
A double-prizer?

72
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:16,772
That was awesome.

73
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,434
You guys realize you're doctors, right?

74
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:22,809
Double secret decoder
ring-wearing doctors.

75
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,927
ACTIVATE!

76
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:27,008
Form of an ice menorah!

00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,048

79
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:45,398
The reason I'm gurney surfing ...

80
00:03:45,398 --> 00:03:47,804
-
- aside from the fact that it's totally bitchin

81
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:50,193
is that Kelso shut down this whole wing.

82
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:51,252
Dude, I gotta go.

83
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:52,816
Oh, no!

84
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:56,200
Oh!

85
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:02,227
You see, a census said that hospital
admissions dropped in February.

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,398
The census...was wrong.

87
00:04:05,677 --> 00:04:08,872
Dr. Kelso! Where are we gonna fit
these people? They're all sick!

88
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:11,677
It's not my job to take
care of sick people.

89
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:13,882
"Bob Kelso
-- Healer"

90
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:16,762
Closing that wing saves us about
sixty thousand dollars a month.

91
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:18,109
You got that on you?

92
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:25,871
It's weird how much Dr. Casey has
influenced me in such a short time.

93
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:26,590
Bink!

94
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:28,609
Hey! Bink you!

95
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:31,865
And it wasn't just me. Dr.
Casey has affected everyone.

96
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:32,785
What's he doing?

97
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:34,907
He's writing Dr.
Casey a thank-you card.

98
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,330
I could use a little help here.

99
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:43,626
Todd, surgeon is spelled "-g-e-o-n"?
And, uh...there are two Ds in "Todd".

100
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:44,193
Yeah....

101
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:51,307
I'm sorry, does

102
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:52,927
mean stare at me like jackasses

103
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:55,191
or does it mean get the hell over here?

104
00:04:57,834 --> 00:05:01,887
All right, then. Mr. Tanaka here is
fatiguing and he needs to be intubated.

105
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:03,099
Any questions?

106
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,033
Yeah, Turk has asked me to be
his best man. You got any advice?

107
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:08,679
Nuh-no. No. I don't.
Not at this moment.

108
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,145
You know what sucks?

109
00:05:11,014 --> 00:05:12,981
Everyone keeps talking about
how Dr. Casey has helped them,

110
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:14,465
and he doesn't even know I exist!

111
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:15,955
So introduce yourself.

112
00:05:15,956 --> 00:05:17,420
I haven't seen him all day.

113
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:21,609
He's probably off trying to help figure out
some procedure that's gonna help save humanity!

114
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:26,972
Why can't I sit on you!? Why?

115
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:29,503
Probably.

116
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,360
Newbie! It turns out I, uh, I
do have some best man advice.

117
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:36,978
Go easy on the mascara in
case you cry during your toast.

118
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:39,311
And if you're gonna chase after the
bouquet with all of the other girls,

119
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:44,050
make sure you kick off your pumps so you don't
snap one of those chicken ankles of yours.

120
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,570
Thanks. Thanks for coming back.

121
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,825
Barbie. Are you sure
you went into his lungs?

122
00:05:49,826 --> 00:05:51,918
'Cause it looks like you're
blowing up his stomach.

123
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:55,680
Aw, dammit, his O2 sat's dropping.
Get out of the way, honey; come on.

124
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:58,538
Even if you've done a
procedure five thousand times,

125
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:01,802
there's no guarantee you won't
screw up number five thousand, one.

126
00:06:01,803 --> 00:06:04,546
A few more seconds, we would have
been coding this guy. Take that.

127
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:10,417
Barbie, as hard as it is to remember,
but  air  goes in  the lungs.

128
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:12,706
Can I practice my toast on you?

129
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:13,275
No.

130
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:15,884
I'm opening with a
quote from 'Spartacus'.

131
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,444
Actually it...goes a little lower.

132
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:24,831
I don't know why Carla wants me to
wear a cummerbund, let alone a red one.

133
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:29,368
Well, come on. As your best man, trust me,
it's not about the style, it's about the fit.

134
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:32,756
When you're out there on the dance floor,
you don't want any restrictions, okay?

135
00:06:32,757 --> 00:06:34,395
Let's test these babies
out one more time.

136
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:37,231
Okay, ready? Five, six, seven, eight.

137
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:43,172
And one, two, three, four, five six,
seven, eight. And drop it, right, it's hot.

138
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:43,926
It is hot!

139
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:45,052
Put one hand on the floor!

140
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:46,282
I can't reach!

141
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:47,751
You better feel the burn!

142
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:48,827
I can feel it burning!

143
00:06:48,828 --> 00:06:51,333
Where I grew up, they didn't
allow two men to marry.

144
00:06:52,566 --> 00:06:53,858
Well, we grew up in ...

145
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:55,282
Well, shoot, I grew up in the 'hood ...

146
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:57,820
...There you gotta do things like
test suits out... ...That's right.

147
00:06:57,821 --> 00:06:59,142
I'ma go change.

148
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:04,265
Uh.... I'm the best man. Do you have
any advice for me to give my friend?

149
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:08,274
Just remind him over and over that the
wedding is all about what the woman wants.

150
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:09,702
Yeah, I'll make sure and do that.

151
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:14,093
Now, as the best man, don't you think my tux
should stand out from the other groomsmen?

152
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:15,558
What did you have in mind?

153
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:18,341
The ring, please?

154
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:20,516
You got the ring?

155
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:22,462
It's got to be one of these!

156
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:27,663
Oh, I've got ideas.

157
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,820
He's crashing. He needs to be intubated!

158
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,387
Dr. Cox!

159
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:37,507
Oh, that's just dandy. I got a
billion patients and no rooms,

160
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:41,524
and I got Newbie pestering me for advice on how
to be the best woman at Turtlehead's wedding,

161
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:47,212
and I got a resident who can't do a simple procedure
even though she learned it the first week she was here.

162
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:49,969
I'm sorry, Dr. Cox. I
don't know what to do.

163
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,669
I'll tell you what to do:
Get the hell out of here.

164
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,358
I swear to God, Carla, if one
more annoying thing comes my way,

165
00:07:56,359 --> 00:08:01,383
please just go ahead and extract some of that extra air
out of Barbie's head and inject it right into my veins!

166
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:04,969
Hey, ace! I want you to find
my gardener, Hector, a room.

167
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:10,032
He has a mild case of cellulitis, and I
need him in tip-top shape by the weekend.

168
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:13,631
I'm having my annual lawn-bowling tournament,
and if anyone but Hector cuts my grass,

169
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:15,529
my game goes to heck in a hand-basket.

170
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,641
Dammit all, Bob, you know we don't
have an extra bed in this dump!

171
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:20,808
Perry, what has two thumbs
and still doesn't give a crap?

172
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:23,006
Bob Kelso! I thought we'd met.

173
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:28,935
Hector. Uh-heh. Cómo esta.

174
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:37,143
Oh, man, this is amazing. I'm your best friend, now
I'm your best man. What am I gonna be best at next?

175
00:08:37,144 --> 00:08:38,431
How about best at not talking?

176
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:42,342
One one thousand, two one
thousand.... And now I'm best at that!

177
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:43,227
Hey!

178
00:08:43,665 --> 00:08:44,629
Me or him?

179
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,197
You.

180
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:45,793
Cool.

181
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,341
What now?

182
00:08:47,558 --> 00:08:49,220
Did you tell anybody
about my epiphany toilet?

183
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:50,309
No, why?

184
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:53,983
Where're you coming from?

185
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:58,244
No

186
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:06,489
If I find out you told anybody, I'm gonna
beat you with poppy's old nickel sock.

187
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:08,422
First of all, why would I tell anyone?

188
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,950
And secondly, no one has
epiphanies on the john!

189
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:21,586
Of course! It's so simple!

190
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:31,082
Oh, Carla, good. Would you tell Hector here
that he can stay just as long as he likes?

191
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:32,926
Aye-aye, captain.

192
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,062
Dice medigo...

193
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:36,188
When two people collide,
a lot of things can happen.

194
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:36,846
...Okay?

195
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:39,078
What the hell is going on in here!?

196
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,370
Oh, hey, Bob. Great news:
we found Hector a room!

197
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:48,760
For some it can be
disaster. For others, it's salvation.

198
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,464
I need help.

199
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,661
Excuse me.

200
00:09:57,575 --> 00:09:59,971
Uh, buddy, can you not point that at me?

201
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:00,626
Sure.

202
00:10:00,627 --> 00:10:03,445
Hi. I'm Kevin.

203
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,589
I know!!! ...Um... I know.

204
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:16,687
Still, the weirdest thing is when two people
collide without ever being in the same room.

205
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:19,978
Hey, Turk, it's your brother. Good
news! My business trip got canceled,

206
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:26,137
so I can be your best man after all!
I'm looking forward to it. Call me.

207
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:33,752
Sure I was hurt when I found out I
was Turk's second choice for best man.

208
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:34,913
But I'm not gonna be petty....

209
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:39,335
I mean, when the tux guy called to confirm
Turk's measurements, I gave them to him.

210
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:44,015
Dude! I look like I'm
going to Ferrakhan day-camp!

211
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:45,760
Just paint your legs
black, you'll be fine.

212
00:10:45,832 --> 00:10:48,851
Look at this lame-ass
bow-tie and cummerbund, man!

213
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:52,883
I'm really thinking about talking to
Carla about this. Whatta you think?

214
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:57,099
Just remind him over and over that the
wedding is all about what the woman wants.

215
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:59,908
You know what? You should
totally say something.

216
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,937
You know, unless you want to set a precedent where
she's walking all over you for the rest of your life;

217
00:11:03,938 --> 00:11:06,472
but it's your call, you
might love that, I don't know.

218
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:14,168
I wanted those red cummerbunds
because that's the theme!

219
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:16,167
Red is a theme?

220
00:11:16,168 --> 00:11:19,466
Love is the theme!
We're in love, you idiot!

221
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:22,543
Just tell me why would you make
such a big deal about something

222
00:11:22,544 --> 00:11:24,933
we both know you don't even care about?

223
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,696
I don't know....

224
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:34,620
Well, I better get to work before
all the good patients are taken.

225
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,597
So tell me, is it harder
being a surgeon or a doctor?

226
00:11:43,598 --> 00:11:47,316
Oh, definitely a surgeon. 'Cause when
you tell people that a loved one died,

227
00:11:47,317 --> 00:11:50,641
you have to do that thing where you pull your
surgical mask down and you shake your head.

228
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:55,081
If you do it too fast, it says,
you know, I knew he was gonna die.

229
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:59,341
And if you take too long and pause
with it, it gives 'em false hope.

230
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:02,133
So you have to do it perfectly.

231
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:03,769
"Ahh, damn."

232
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:09,291
If one of my loved ones ever
dies...I hope it's because of you.

233
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:11,248
Hey, me too.

234
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,477
Are we, uh, flirting?

235
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:15,809
A little bit.

236
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:17,678
Awesome!

237
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,304
Have you seen the roof toilet?

238
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,505
No. But I'm a nervous pooer.

239
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:23,203
Okay, now we're definitely not flirting.

240
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:26,533
Oh, it's just that I'm a little more comfortable
with the setup that I have at home, you know.

241
00:12:26,534 --> 00:12:27,856
Like...extra locks.

242
00:12:28,837 --> 00:12:30,296
Yeah, I've only gone
outside my house twice.

243
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:33,215
Once on an airplane, and
once at the White House.

244
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:35,397
How are the bathrooms
at the White House?

245
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:36,787
I have no idea, but
the fountains are nice.

246
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:40,303
And security? Quick as bunnies.

247
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:43,337
Listen, Dr. Casey, um, I know that
you've helped out a lot of people,

248
00:12:43,338 --> 00:12:45,794
and I've got this,
uh, intubating problem.

249
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:47,302
I'll be right back.

250
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:48,800
Where are you going?

251
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:53,000
To climb a mountain.

252
00:12:55,748 --> 00:12:57,366
This is completely unacceptable!

253
00:12:57,367 --> 00:12:58,903
Well, you said find him a room!

254
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,290
Not my office, dammit!

255
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,248
He's your gardener, for God's sake!

256
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,123
I could have both of you suspended...

257
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,684
You made your own bed, now your
underpaid gardener's gotta sleep in it!

258
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:20,272
Fine! Get out of here! I'll
get some paperwork done!

259
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:29,270
Oh, man. Tell me you're not
waiting to use my roof toilet!

260
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:33,716
Well, I would use Dr. Kelso's like I
normally do, but I don't wanna wake up Hector.

261
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:36,719
Okay, look, attention roof-poopers!

262
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:42,416
Setting aside for a moment the fact that I'm gonna
make sure that you all live to regret this day,

263
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:44,941
let's keep the magic rolling

264
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:48,690
let's not tell anyone else that
there's a toilet on the roof.

265
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:50,316
There is not a toilet on the roof!

266
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:51,731
But you just said there was.

267
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:55,306
No! Yes, I did, but I was
using a metaphor...uhh...

268
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:58,029
that means..."God is watching us."

269
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,919
You've heard this, "There's
a toilet on the roof."

270
00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:04,676
Right? People?

271
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,687
That's right, ain't nothing up there.

272
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:10,129
Cool.

273
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,649
You know what, it's time to
stop feeling sorry for yourself.

274
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,932
You're still best man.

275
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:19,048
It's not like Turk's gonna
take that away from you.

276
00:14:19,932 --> 00:14:20,661
J.D., can I talk to you?

277
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:21,633
AGH!

278
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:23,475
Have you seen Carla around?

279
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,463
Phew! False alarm.

280
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,817
'Cause I need to, uh,
talk to you in private?

281
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:29,138
Sort of man to man?

282
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:30,254
AGH!

283
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:33,126
I can't right now, Turk.
I am completely swamped.

284
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:35,429
You're drawing lightning
bolts on your Nikes.

285
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,324
So I can get to my patients faster.

286
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:38,508
How 'bout later?

287
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:39,823
Later's no good, dude.

288
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:41,322
I gotta stop by the tux shop,

289
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:44,829
then I gotta finish telling my whole
family that you picked me as your best man!

290
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,245
This  is  hard.

291
00:14:50,246 --> 00:14:51,594
I'm sorry it took me so long

292
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,967
I had to go home. That damn
roof toilet's got my number.

293
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:56,136
Can't lick it, huh?

294
00:14:56,137 --> 00:14:58,930
Oh, God, no! I can't even sit on it.

295
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:02,890
Look, um, that problem I
was talking about before....

296
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:05,619
I can't seem to intubate
patients anymore.

297
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,536
I mean, I used to do that
better than anyone here.

298
00:15:07,537 --> 00:15:11,019
Now the only thing that sets me apart from
the other doctors is that my beeper plays

299
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:16,927
"That's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh, I like
it! Mm-hm, mm-hmm!" I don't know what to do.

300
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,537
It's just a piece of porcelain!

301
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:21,605
I mean, there's no reason we both
shouldn't be able to sit on it!

302
00:15:21,606 --> 00:15:25,242
Yeah, um, about my
career-ending problem....

303
00:15:25,243 --> 00:15:26,502
We must conquer the roof toilet.

304
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:28,080
ENOUGH ABOUT THE ROOF TOILET!

305
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:30,473
Listen, all I've heard about from
everyone is how amazing you are,

306
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:32,389
and I'm not leaving here
until you help me out!

307
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,414
Dammit! I have to go.

308
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:36,795
Elliot.

309
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:38,852
I'll help you.

310
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:40,712
Thanks.

311
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:48,135
"Furthermore, if Sacred Heart Elementary
for Girls does not change its name posthaste"

312
00:15:48,136 --> 00:15:49,954
I thought that
was a nice touch --

313
00:15:49,955 --> 00:15:54,714
"legal action will be taken,
posthaste." Wait, that's wrong.

314
00:15:54,715 --> 00:15:55,607
Shocker.

315
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:58,808
I can't even think straight
with this incessant whispering.

316
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:01,145
It's like a Spanish
golf tournament in here!

317
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:04,982
I'm sorry, Dr. Kelso, but I'm
trying to get their lunch orders!

318
00:16:04,983 --> 00:16:05,924
Oh, that reminds me.

319
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:11,617
Hector, Enid made you a prosciutto
and mozzarella sandwich, but I...uh...

320
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:16,285
well, there was a
misunderstanding and now it's gone.

321
00:16:17,872 --> 00:16:21,322
Espero no se la causando ningún problema a Dr.
Kelso. (I hope I'm not causing Dr. Kelso any trouble.)

322
00:16:21,323 --> 00:16:23,382
Oh, screw him, he ate your sandwich.

323
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:27,930
I forget. Is "{? Spanish}"
"kill him" or "screw him"?

324
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:29,100
"Screw him."

325
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:30,644
Awwww.

326
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:42,201
That's it! I just have
to go and talk to him!

327
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:46,320
...Kevin Casey.

328
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:48,000
Dr. Casey! Have you seen Turk?

329
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:52,543
Oh, yeah, nice guy...good
surgeon...great dancer.

330
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,108
You should see us gettin' down
when we try pants on together.

331
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:58,159
Yeah-heh. I have to go.

332
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,727
Cool. I'll see you tomorrow.

333
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,522
Uh, actually, no.
I got a call --

334
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:02,664
I have to go back to my hospital.

335
00:17:02,665 --> 00:17:04,138
Why? Why do you have to do that?

336
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:05,375
Well, look at it this way:

337
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:09,713
Uh, I may be leaving here,
but I will always be there.

338
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:11,054
I know.

339
00:17:11,055 --> 00:17:12,590
I am so messing with you.

340
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:14,021
Ha, I know.... Okay.

341
00:17:14,022 --> 00:17:16,980
Well, sir, it was
amazing to work with you.

342
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:17,674
Thank you.

343
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:19,395
And that's three seconds!

344
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:20,033
Okay, sorry.

345
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:20,875
Okay.

346
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:26,952
Watching Kevin go, I wondered how gay I
looked giving that two-handed handshake.

347
00:17:26,953 --> 00:17:30,568
And also how weird it was that
someone could just walk into your life,

348
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:34,729
have such a big impact, and then vanish
just like that, never to be seen again.

349
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,589
But mostly I thought about
how, in some small way,

350
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,970
Kevin had helped every
single person he met here.

351
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:51,969
Kevin? Has anybody seen Kevin?

352
00:17:58,838 --> 00:18:00,022
Where the hell is Turk?

353
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:06,992
What's wrong?

354
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:12,020
Kevin left. Didn't even say goodbye.

355
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:14,143
Elliot, he didn't say
goodbye to a lot of people.

356
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:18,625
Trust me, Dr. Cox, Carla,
Doug, Snoop Dogg Intern...

357
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:20,570
Where my hos at?

358
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:21,732
I haven't seen them.

359
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:25,724
Look, I don't wanna sound pathetic,
but, he didn't even help me.

360
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:27,528
He didn't help a lot of people, Elliot.

361
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:31,611
It was just me, and Turk, and Carla,
and Dr. Cox, and Doug, and Dr. Mickhead--

362
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,496
Mickhead? No, Mickhead's in rehab.

363
00:18:33,497 --> 00:18:35,509
Was in rehab, Elliot.

364
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,221
Was. He'll never huff paint again.

365
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:42,394
But look, if you need help,
I'm always here for you.

366
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:47,279
All right, see, with intubating....

367
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,671
I can't seem to
intubate patien--

368
00:18:48,672 --> 00:18:49,576
There's Turk. I gotta go.

369
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,244
Elliot?

370
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,425
Aunt Lillian?

371
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,223
Aunt Lillian?

372
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,777
What is it, there, Barbie?

373
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,120
I need help.

374
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:08,197
I know you do, sweetie, but here
I'm plum out of hair scrunchies.

375
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:11,445
Now scram, princess, we're
waiting for somebody. Go on.

376
00:19:11,446 --> 00:19:16,433
Hector's wife just set my drapes
on fire with her damn prayer candle!

377
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:17,137
He's here!

378
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:19,621
I want them both out of my office!

379
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:22,276
Sir, there's a ton of
empty beds right here.

380
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:24,680
All you have to do is flick the switch.

381
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:26,379
You know how to do that, don't you, Bob?

382
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,290
You just bend over...and flick.

383
00:19:44,653 --> 00:19:46,114
Yeah, I thought so.

384
00:20:00,212 --> 00:20:02,203
"Follow me"

385
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,170
Who took this?

386
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:53,904
"Polaroid with self-timer"

387
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:56,018
"Your turn"

388
00:21:03,918 --> 00:21:07,248
With Marbury, I really believe New
York has a shot at the title, man.

389
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:08,559
Yeah, me too.

390
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,015
Which sport are we talking about?

391
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:11,411
I wanna say tennis....

392
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:16,617
Look, Turk, I heard the message that
your brother left on the machine.

393
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:22,328
I want you to know, if there's anything I
can do to make your whole wedding go smoother,

394
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:27,597
just tell me. Even if it's
stepping down from being best man.

395
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:31,919
The only reason I asked my brother to be best man
was because I knew he couldn't come to the wedding.

396
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,114
But now his plans have
changed and he's all excited.

397
00:21:36,622 --> 00:21:39,721
Dude, it has to be you, you know that.

398
00:21:40,806 --> 00:21:44,288
It's always uncomfortable when two
guys wanna say something each other.

399
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:46,539
Look, you've been my best
friend for ten years, man;

400
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,694
I've loved you since college, and
you know I'd do anything for you.

401
00:21:48,694 --> 00:21:50,449
Dude, look, man, you're my friend and I frickin' love
you; and no one's looked out for me like you have.

402
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:50,935
Cool.

403
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:51,813
Solid.

404
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,887
You know, if it makes it easier,
I guess we could be co-best men.

405
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,613
You have no idea how much
stress that would relieve.

406
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:05,917
...Even though...God said
it's supposed to be one....

407
00:22:09,822 --> 00:22:12,546
You ever think there's more
to Dr. Kelso than we know?

408
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:18,663
Sure, is he in fact a latex-encased robot with real
human hair and a circuit board where his heart should be?

409
00:22:18,664 --> 00:22:20,696
I can't...I can't rule that out.

410
00:22:20,697 --> 00:22:26,113
You know, Hector told me he's worked
for Dr. Kelso for twenty years.

411
00:22:26,114 --> 00:22:29,411
That's half his life. I
mean, I know he looks 50,

412
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:32,014
but that's what being in the
sun all day does to your skin.

413
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:32,717
Right, right.

414
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,799
The point is, it doesn't
seem like he hates Dr. Kelso.

415
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,489
Say...Say, Bobbo...

416
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:43,872
Is it possible that you're occasionally a decent
human being in your life outside of this place?

417
00:22:43,873 --> 00:22:47,855
Well, champ, seeing as you don't
exist in my life outside this place,

418
00:22:47,856 --> 00:22:50,014
I doubt it's any of your damn business.

419
00:22:57,996 --> 00:23:00,668
So far no epiphanies.

420
00:23:01,142 --> 00:23:04,237
Except that outdoor toilet
seats are like frickin' icicles!

421
00:23:04,238 --> 00:23:06,947
Eh, at least no one saw me go....

422
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:27,213
Go! Let's go, let's go!

423
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:32,335
Uh, hi. We don't have
a helicopter pad--

424
00:23:32,336 --> 00:23:35,354
We're out of time! He's losing
oxygen, he needs to be intubated now!

425
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:36,641
Okay, just let me get someone.

426
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:38,703
NOW! You! Let's go! Do it!

427
00:23:42,218 --> 00:23:43,015
Come on!

428
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,312
I'm in.

429
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:56,878
You see, this is why I wanted
you to use the bathroom up here.

430
00:23:57,998 --> 00:24:02,758
If there's something you know you can do,
whether it's intubating a patient or...

431
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:07,326
copping a squat on the roof, and your
mind keeps throwing up roadblocks,

432
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:10,925
just know you can
drive right through 'em.

433
00:24:12,713 --> 00:24:15,378
And if that doesn't
help, maybe this will....

434
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:36,993
I can't believe it's gone.

435
00:24:36,994 --> 00:24:39,259
I think it's human nature
to search for answers.

436
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,758
Dude. Why is your tux gonna
cost four thousand dollars?

437
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:45,364
No reason.

438
00:24:45,365 --> 00:24:49,209
Sometimes the answer you get
is the one you least expect.

439
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:54,571
All right, pipe down! Now,
who's up for Dairy Queen?

440
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:56,667
Dairy Queen!

441
00:24:56,668 --> 00:24:58,455
But more often than not,

442
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:01,168
the answers we've been looking
for have been inside us all along.

443
00:25:06,602 --> 00:25:07,862
Well done, there, Barbie.

444
00:25:07,863 --> 00:25:10,514
You're now exactly where
you were three years ago.

445
00:25:14,363 --> 00:25:16,990
I guess the important thing
is to never stop searching.

446
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,083
Occupied!

447
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:28,052
I'll help you. Nah. Okay.
