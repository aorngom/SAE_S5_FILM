1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,117
Hey, how you doing?

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,794
I know we put on
a hell of a show, but, dude,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,711
put some shades on or somethin'.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,597
Don't make a big deal out of this.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,636
When was the last time
you got laid?

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,518
<i>OK, just subtly take</i>
<i>the spotlight off yourself.</i>

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,512
Once on a red-eye flight,
Turk groped a transsexual.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,070
Baby, it was dark, and he<i>l</i>she
had a body that was rockin'.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,434
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,715
We're talking about you now, studly.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,234
OK, so I'm in a bit of a dry spell.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,311
I have no idea
what to do with myself.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,550
Why not give Rowdy a bath?
He smells ripe.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,552
Please. I'm a young, single
player with a heart of gold.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,631
I should be able
to stir something up.

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,716
How do you get so dirty?

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,279
Rowdy.

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,032
<i>I'm not the only one in a rut.</i>

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,429
- My life is a mess.
- At least you're pretty.

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,239
- Pretty don't pay the rent.
- It does for my sister.

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,117
Your sister's a prostitute?

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,590
She's a model. Come on, we talked
about thinking before we speak.

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,874
I was just frazzled.

24
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,838
I stopped taking my dad's money,
I can't pay the bills,

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,673
I'm getting kicked out,
and thanks to this hospital,

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,910
I haven't had time
to look for a new place.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,798
<i>Sometimes the hospital</i>
<i>seems like a hungry monster</i>

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,677
<i>that feeds on our personal lives.</i>

29
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,037
<i>It affects all of us.</i>

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,918
- Morning, Dr Cox.
- Denise. I know it's morning.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,072
If it was last night I'd still
be with my pregnant ex-wife

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,914
trying to get her to calm down
because, believe it or not,

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,639
I managed to forget
to bring home the curly fries.

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,235
Do you see where I'm going here?
Yes, no, maybe so?

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,231
Talk to her.

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,840
The man's got troubles.

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,593
You're one of the cutest doctors
I've ever met.

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,750
Give me a kiss.

39
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,309
Well, put it in your pocket
and save it for later.

40
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,518
<i>The monster kills everything</i>
<i>that's beautiful. Everything.</i>

41
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,476
<i>Except Lisa, the gift-shop girl.</i>

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,790
Boys, remember now,
when we get upstairs

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,189
it's the trauma ward,
not the drama ward,

44
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,350
so smiles, everyone, smiles.

45
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,035
<i>Whatever. Dry spell,</i>
<i>prepare to be moistened.</i>

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,111
Hey, Lisa, how you doing?

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,952
JD, I can't give you free gum.

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,838
I was thinking,
you're probably one of those girls

49
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,992
that's so pretty that no one
has the courage to ask you out.

50
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,877
No, I get asked out
all the time.

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,430
<i>OK, momentary setback.</i>
<i>Regroup. Regroup!</i>

52
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,193
Hey, go out with me.

53
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,872
It's the right thing to do.

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,751
Sure. Why not?

55
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,510
Very funny,
you dumb choir punks.

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,431
Santa's a drunk.

57
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,670
Where were we?

58
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,637
So what did you have in mind?

59
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,870
I could think
of a couple of things.

60
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,876
- How does he get so dirty?
- Who the hell cares?

61
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,557
- I'll see you tonight.
- OK. Bye.

62
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,871
- Nice to meet you, Turk.
- A pleasure meeting you, Lisa.

63
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,712
Yeah, Gift-Shop Girl.

64
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,519
- <i>Player</i>
- <i>Hold me down</i>

65
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,795
- Know what I'm saying?
- Hey, look at me.

66
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,189
Turn Gift-Shop Girl
into Gift-Shop Woman.

67
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,317
I swear on all the gifts in her shop,
I will make you proud.

68
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,870
That's my dog. That's my dog!

69
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,910
Come to Papa.

70
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,275
The coil didn't complete
its revolution.

71
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,716
My candy's just hanging there
instead of dropping.

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,234
OK, whatever.
Look, if you're hungry, man,

73
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,914
- I can loan you a buck.
- A buck?

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,357
What a kind offer
from the charitable Dr Money Bags.

75
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,396
You can either be a jerk as usual,

76
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,471
or you can accept
this gracious offer

77
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,233
and get some caramel
draped in nougat.

78
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,470
Your choice, jumpsuit.

79
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,509
Jordan, I have to tell you,
despite how crazy hormonal you are,

80
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,673
there is something about a pregnant
woman that's almost spiritual.

81
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,478
- Really?
- Honestly, you...

82
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,471
You have never looked
so beautiful.

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,233
- It's the giant boobs.
- Have you seen them lately?

84
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,912
Yes. Relax.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,639
I've seen bigger.

86
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,393
No, not you. Although, kudos.

87
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,879
Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,394
- You know what I hate?
- So many things.

89
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,109
That's true. I stay at your house
every night and then in the morning

90
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,998
I've gotta drive back
to my apartment to get ready

91
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,548
and then back here
to go to board meetings.

92
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,952
Then just leave your boobs
and some other stuff at my place.

93
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,429
- Really?
- Yeah, if it saves you the hassle.

94
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,832
- Bring it on.
- Well, great. See you tonight.

95
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,797
It appears
Mrs Watson has developed

96
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,519
a post-op infection
at her thyroidectomy site.

97
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,595
Newbie, when a patient
has an infection,

98
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,558
I make it a general policy
not to actually push on it.

99
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,835
Start Ancef,
one gram Q eight hours and...

100
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,912
Oh, my God, did I just ask
my ex-wife to move in with me?

101
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,119
What? You don't own that.

102
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,998
Turk, come help me wrap presents.

103
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,469
Baby, do you realize
how long it's been

104
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,358
since we've had an afternoon off,
just the two of us?

105
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,919
Yeah.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,070
I should give you
a sensual massage,

107
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,188
rub your feet a little,
and maybe, if you're interested,

108
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,555
sex you up and whatnot.

109
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,796
- Come here.
- I'll get the TV.

110
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,155
No, you know what? Leave it on.

111
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,435
I know how much you like
<i>The Jeffersons.</i>

112
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,988
Baby, you're a gift from God.

113
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,150
Here come Daddy!

114
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,752
I'm gonna rock your world!

115
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,435
Turk, the show's starting.

116
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,751
Ha! I put those flyers up
and nobody wants me to live with them.

117
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,274
Come on, I'm sure
you'll find a roommate

118
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,555
who's a "clean,
non-smoking vegetarian

119
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,518
that rinses the shower
thoroughly after each usage."

120
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,238
If you don't, it gets mildewy.

121
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,914
You should move in
with my friend, Anal McLooney.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,389
I had to move out
of my apartment this morning.

123
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,072
My stuff is outside in a truck.

124
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,515
Why not crash with us
until you find a place?

125
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,910
I'm so tired of everyone always
thinking I need to be rescued.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,592
- OK, JD?
- Fine.

127
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,114
Can anyone tell me
the bacterial aetiology

128
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,077
of toxic shock syndrome?

129
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,559
I beg your pardon.

130
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,677
So many doctors standing around,
I assumed it was rounds.

131
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,355
You were looking at the wall,
so that means it's an art exhibit.

132
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,194
When does the gay gentleman come round
with the tray of champagne?

133
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,236
Sir, my father cut me off...

134
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,312
Dr Reid, this is not
bring-your-problems-to-work day.

135
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,675
This is just work day.

136
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,193
But, sir, only one person
took a phone number so far.

137
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,352
Someone's getting a late-night,
drunk call from the Todd.

138
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,237
- Lucky girl.
- Yeah.

139
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,556
All right, Mrs Carlson,
the surgeon

140
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,108
that's coming to do
your lymph node dissection

141
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,919
is a handsome young man,
so don't forget about me.

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,514
- I'm serious, you naughty girl.
- Sure, Jordan.

143
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,795
You could take over
the master bathroom.

144
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,553
But do me a favour
and leave my sleeping pills out

145
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,599
in case when I get home
I wanna take 300 of 'em? OK, bye.

146
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,275
I can't stop obsessing about this date.
What do you think I should do?

147
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,954
You should go ahead
and thank your lucky stars

148
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,271
you finally found a gal
who's into same-sex relationships.

149
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,078
- You know, Perry...
- Perry?

150
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,515
I'm trying it out.
I find with the ladies,

151
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,637
if you're clear with your
intentions right off the bat,

152
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,517
they just fall into place.

153
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,999
- AQ?
- What?

154
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,799
It's a new expression.
It means "any questions?"

155
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,917
Don't think I'm impressed
because you managed to score

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,753
a sympathy date with whatever
homely looking chick

157
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,831
is managing
the gift shop nowadays.

158
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,512
JD, you ready to go?

159
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,319
Oh, yeah, the word
you're looking for is "wow,"

160
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,676
and the words I'm looking for
are "in your face."

161
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,591
Yeah, I'm ready. Let's get going.

162
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,592
PO. Peace out.

163
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,671
Jordan, if you're feeling like crap,

164
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,356
then I'll come straight home...
Of course, with the food.

165
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,637
No, I don't necessarily know
if there is anything bigger

166
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,678
than a Super Size,
but I'll ask the guy...

167
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,910
- <i>Get two Super Sizes.</i>
- Oh, my God.

168
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,634
Oh, hell, yeah.

169
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,553
- Did I fall asleep?
- Yes.

170
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,313
Was that before or after
I rocked your world?

171
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,994
He's a good man. He's a good man.
He's a good man.

172
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,719
You know I get nervous
when you start chanting.

173
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,995
Turk, what happened
to all my stuff?

174
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,959
The massage, the bath, the feet?
I let you watch <i>The Jeffersons.</i>

175
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,996
Baby, I was just
exhausted from work.

176
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,152
When you were an intern,
you were exhausted from work,

177
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,231
but you always made
time for romance.

178
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,915
That's cos I was still trying
to get into your delicates.

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,989
Oh, my God.

180
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,032
Dr Reid?
What are you doing in here?

181
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,039
Hi, Dr Kelso. I was just...
I was on call.

182
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,111
Well, I have
the call sheet right here

183
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,998
and your name
doesn't seem to be on it.

184
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,672
But what do I know?

185
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,797
I'm just a kindly old man
who doesn't know the difference

186
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,472
between a doctor on call

187
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,838
and one who maybe
just needs a warm bed for the night.

188
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,751
I've just been
so swamped with work

189
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,274
I couldn't even make time
to find a new place.

190
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,114
I understand.
Life is hard and all that.

191
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,715
But if you want
a bed in my hospital,

192
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,952
you better have a damn rent check
or a massive coronary

193
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,996
in the next five seconds.

194
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,550
And believe me, missy,
either one's fine with me.

195
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,996
- Thank you, sir.
- No problem.

196
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,196
I had a really
good time tonight.

197
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,114
I was nervous when you spent
five minutes talking through a napkin.

198
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,351
That wasn't me. That was Nappy,
the ice-breaking puppet.

199
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,635
That little guy earned
his money tonight.

200
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,678
- So you think you're in, huh?
- Come on, I am so in.

201
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,638
- You can't be sure.
- I feel pretty good about it.

202
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,234
- You want me.
- I don't.

203
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,788
Yeah, I'm a doctor.
All the symptoms are there.

204
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,472
You do.

205
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,471
Just kiss me.

206
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,998
Whoa. You know,
I thought I had to sneeze,

207
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,036
but it was a false alarm.

208
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,350
- Let's do this.
- OK.

209
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,595
You know what it is?
It's like a tickling.

210
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,353
I got this, like, weird...
It's a flutter.

211
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,795
Nappy? Stop fooling around and...

212
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,872
Give me a kiss.

213
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,997
<i>I guess you never know</i>
<i>how the monster's gonna attack.</i>

214
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,470
<i>Sometimes it makes you so tired</i>
<i>of taking care of people at work,</i>

215
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,711
<i>you can't bear the thought</i>
<i>of taking care of someone at home.</i>

216
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,032
All right, we need to talk about this.

217
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,792
<i>Sometimes it pulls you away</i>
<i>at the absolute worst time.</i>

218
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,757
Babe, I'm sorry.

219
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,357
<i>Sometimes it even takes</i>
<i>the roof over your head.</i>

220
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,749
<i>And sometimes</i>
<i>the monster takes something</i>

221
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,991
<i>you never thought</i>
<i>you could lose.</i>

222
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,396
<i>Like your mojo.</i>

223
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,711
Is that a roll of quarters
or are you just having a good time?

224
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,430
Actually, it's a roll of quarters.
It's laundry day.

225
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,431
See ya.

226
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,109
<i>So, Little JD</i>
<i>isn't rising to the occasion.</i>

227
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,873
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>
<i>Nobody knows about this but me.</i>

228
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,633
- Newbie, what's up?
- Everything's up.

229
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,438
Rise and shine, sport.

230
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,351
<i>What, did someone</i>
<i>send out a flyer?</i>

231
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,032
Hey, JD. How's your penis?

232
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,509
<i>Calm down.</i>
<i>He says that to everyone.</i>

233
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,556
Hey, Goldman. How's your penis?

234
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,030
<i>You're freaking out.</i>
<i>Just keep your head down and move.</i>

235
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,474
I get it.
I haven't paid you back,

236
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,790
- so you won't even look at me.
- No.

237
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,316
It's been one day,
you greedy little bastard.

238
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,391
<i>See what you did?</i>

239
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,472
<i>Dr Reid,</i>
<i>your truck is double-parked.</i>

240
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,876
<i>Luckily, I had a friend</i>
<i>I could talk to about anything.</i>

241
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,509
Turk, do you ever have any trouble
getting your manhood going?

242
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,592
- Hells, no.
- Yeah! Me, neither, dog.

243
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,471
<i>Apparently I'm the only one</i>
<i>here with women problems.</i>

244
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,519
Listen, Perry, shockingly, I'm not
looking to make the permanent move

245
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,273
to your bachelor cave
over at Swingers Towers.

246
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,715
You made a kind gesture
and I made the mistake

247
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,236
of thinking you could follow
through with it. Do you get it?

248
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,992
You don't get it, do you?

249
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,389
We've been together
for a year and a half.

250
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,916
The romance can't be gone yet.
Does this make any sense to you?

251
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,639
Cos it doesn't to me.
One minute we're clicking,

252
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,837
and the next you're running
for your life. What's going on?

253
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,434
<i>I know we seem insensitive,</i>
<i>but in the crunch,</i>

254
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,114
<i>most guys are smart enough</i>
<i>to say the right thing.</i>

255
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,033
Baby, you have got to chill.

256
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,829
I'm sorry.
Crazy person says what?

257
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,717
- What?
- Thatta girl.

258
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,634
<i>Sometimes the worst thing</i>
<i>a guy can say is nothing at all.</i>

259
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,632
You know what? Forget it.

260
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,592
Dr Reid.

261
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,956
I have no reading material
for my daily, post-lunch...

262
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,395
well, let's just call it
"reading session."

263
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,710
I need your research proposal

264
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,030
or a <i>Vanity Fair,</i>
if you have one.

265
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,680
If I could just get
a little more time on that...

266
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,389
I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm fresh
out of special treatment today.

267
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,315
I used it all trying not to stare
at that albino doctor down in radiology.

268
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,639
Don't let him get to you. Just keep
saying positive things to yourself.

269
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,029
It's too much.
I'm just one person.

270
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,951
Thatta girl.

271
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,031
Sometimes I get
so jealous of Turk.

272
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,429
We're residents now
and we're so swamped,

273
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,351
and he just
never seems to show it.

274
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,716
I guess you pick up the slack
when he doesn't have the energy.

275
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,234
Yeah, you would think so.

276
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,879
- Aren't you gonna get that?
- Nah, it's just Todd.

277
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,157
He's called four times to ask
if I want to move into his pants.

278
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,599
<i>You never expect a cliché</i>
<i>to be an actual conversation starter.</i>

279
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,399
- Women, huh?
- Tell me about it.

280
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,596
It's like they're from another planet.

281
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,274
OK, I'm going to engage
you two in a conversation.

282
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,032
You will speak of it to no one.

283
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,439
- Agreed?
- OK.

284
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,671
It has gotten to the point
where I'm going back in my head

285
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,591
over all my old relationships.

286
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,477
I'm not going to sit here

287
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,313
and count up all the women
I've ever slept with.

288
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,389
- Twelve.
- Nine.

289
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,278
Eighteen. But none of them
really understood me.

290
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,397
I consider myself a romantic guy
who's stressed out.

291
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,358
I thought the person
who'd understand would be Carla.

292
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,113
The weird thing
is that I'm trying this time.

293
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,509
I just wonder
if I'm what she really wants.

294
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,593
I wonder if I'll ever be able
to make it work out with anyone.

295
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,955
My peep's on the fritz.

296
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,156
Dude!

297
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,071
- Poor Newbie.
- No.

298
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,391
I'm talking about you guys.
You guys are like my peeps,

299
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,550
you're my dogs,
and you're on the fritz,

300
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,393
so that's where I get "peeps",
"fritz" came from.

301
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,074
God love you, Newbie.

302
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,436
Thank you for giving me
some perspective.

303
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,071
There's your stupid dollar.

304
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,755
And by the way, your new nickname
is Pee Pee La Fritz.

305
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,751
Enjoy.

306
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,236
- Hey.
- Is this where you're sleeping tonight?

307
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,155
Yeah. So? It's cosy.
Hospital adjacent.

308
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,356
Elliot, come on, this is crazy.

309
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,557
You're living out of a van,
like a hobo or...

310
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,030
- Jewel.
- Her poetry changed my life.

311
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,998
I know you wanna show you can
stand on your own two feet,

312
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,913
but you don't have
to prove anything to me.

313
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,036
Come on, come stay
with me and Turk.

314
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,478
What'd you page me
to the roof for?

315
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,473
Well, I was thinking
that you work so hard,

316
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,677
and that if I want
surprise and romance

317
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,912
that maybe it's my turn
to be the one who brings it.

318
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,551
So I brought us
a couple of salads.

319
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,837
- That's great.
- A box of 36 hot wings.

320
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,956
Now, that's what I'm talking 'bout.

321
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,758
And some blue-cheese dressing.

322
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,435
I love this woman!

323
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,317
<i>I guess, in the end,</i>

324
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,356
<i>the monster's always</i>
<i>gonna be there.</i>

325
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,435
<i>The trick is to not let it beat you.</i>

326
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,396
Curly fries?

327
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,392
<i>And sometimes that means</i>
<i>letting a friend help you out.</i>

328
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,029
- Thanks again, JD.
- Don't sweat it.

329
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,510
- Well, have a good night.
- You too.

330
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,830
<i>As for me, I just have</i>
<i>to hope that my problem</i>

331
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,070
