00:00:00,957 --> 00:00:02,894
<i>Since the geriatric wing was being remodeled,</i>

2
00:00:02,904 --> 00:00:05,430
<i>Turk were herding old people
to their new rooms.</i>

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,722
That's a closet, mr. Jenkins.

4
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:11,995
Come on, mr. Benedetti, you're only a few thousand tiny steps away.

5
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:16,134
JD, we need to find a way to
move these gomers faster.

6
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:22,298
All aboard! The love train.

7
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:39,010
That was a fun fantasy, I wish it didn't have to end.

8
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:42,108
Hey...

9
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:45,366
That's a nice jacket, Ted.

10
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:48,777
- What is it, wool?
- It's a poly-nylon blend

11
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:50,065
do you really like it?

12
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:53,270
No. Bathroom's just put of paper towels.

13
00:00:56,332 --> 00:01:00,000
I know it's confusing, but these
are your new rooms, ok?

14
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:03,454
Please, try to stay put. Great.

15
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:05,039
Bye-bye.

16
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:10,141
<i>Since Elliot revealed that Dr.Kelso was 65,</i>

17
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:12,382
<i>the board was forcing him
to retire in a few weeks.</i>

18
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:14,707
This is even worse than when they decided

19
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:17,008
female staffers couldn't
wear open-toed shoes!  

20
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:20,165
Ob-obviously, this is much worse...

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,761
but that sucked too.

22
00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:25,498
I feel like I've given my life to this
place and got nothing in return.

23
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:28,848
I mean, is there an MRI machine
in my basement? Maybe.

24
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,814
I guess I just wanted to end my
career on my own terms, you know?

25
00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:35,242
- Oh...
- We gotta help him save his job.

26
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,748
- You guys are gonna help, right?
- Of course.

27
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:39,377
First we gotta handle something.

28
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:43,525
<i>Dr. Cox had a patient that he couldn't
be able to diagnoaveva unse in two years.</i>

29
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:45,394
<i>And he went back again.</i>

30
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:49,598
Look, Alex, I'm afraid I still don't
know what's causing all of this,

31
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,781
so I'm gonna go ahead and treat your
heart palpitations with betablockers.

32
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:57,056
Turk and I couldn't resist play the
little game called "poke the bear".

33
00:01:57,522 --> 00:02:00,707
Turk, yesterday I had this patient
I just could not diagnose.

34
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:03,386
Wow, you must have felt like a real jackass.

35
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:06,571
I did feel like a jackass, but then I was
able to figure out what was wrong with him,

36
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:09,061
because I'm not a jackass, I'm a good doctor.

37
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:12,340
<i>Ok, now just stay calm, so he
doesn't know what you're up to.</i>

38
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:15,280
<i>Oh, no, Turk's breaking!</i>

39
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:17,940
<i>Quick, distract the bear with a casual greeting!</i>

40
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,560
Oh, hey Dr. Cox, how are things?

41
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:25,239
My God, that was amazing. I never
felt so alive in my whole life.

42
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,681
My heart stopped for a second.

43
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:28,553
- We made it. I love you, man.
- I love you too.

44
00:02:28,623 --> 00:02:31,248
You smell like an athlete.

45
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:34,725
- I need one of those.
- A hug?

46
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:36,738
No, a black friend.

47
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:39,030
I think it would make me much cooler.

48
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:41,194
I should be offended, but he's right.

49
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:42,915
Why are you so gloomy?

50
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:45,838
I thought you'd be super-psyed that
Kelso's being forced out of his job.

51
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:49,298
Dr. Kelso's being forced out?
I did not know that.

52
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:51,789
Will you excuse me for a moment?

53
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:58,498
I'm free! I'm free! I'm beautiful and I'm free!

54
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,152
I'm free! Give me some sugar!

55
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,802
It's finally over! I'm free!

56
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:10,248
Holy cow! Buddy, are you all right?

57
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:13,147
Ted?

58
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,290
Are you not talking 'cause your
mouth is filling up with blood?

59
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:21,495
You're gonna pass out, aren't you?
Oh, boy there he goes.

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,954
Yipes!

66
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,689
<i>At certain times in our lives,
we all get introspective.</i>

67
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:47,197
Taking it all in, too?

68
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:48,964
Why don't you have a seat, son?

69
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,046
Actually, sir, uhm, my shift is
bout to start, so I should...

70
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,817
Son, I don't care if the cure for cancer was laughter

71
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,498
and you had Nipsey Russell
in your backpack. Parking!

72
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:01,370
I'm gonna get all nostalgic, crap.

73
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:04,209
What's that strange red puddle
loosing towards us?

74
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:05,808
Oh, that's just Ted's blood.

75
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:08,204
Apparently he bit of a chunk of his tongue.

76
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,919
Anyway, when I started here, I was only 26.

77
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:17,874
Aaaaand done!

78
00:04:18,397 --> 00:04:20,784
- 23 stitches.
- Here's some painkillers.

79
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:25,232
I want to take one of those
every four hours, ok?

80
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:27,531
No trying to talk.

81
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,526
I keep thinking about Kelso.

82
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:31,661
He reminds me
of my grandpa.

83
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:34,701
He's pervy, demeaning,
and a tinsy bit racist,

84
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:38,003
but you crave his love anyway,
because he smells like peppermint.

85
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:41,065
I've always respected Kelso.
He's got a though job.

86
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:44,297
And I bet deep down, everybody here
want us to help him keep it.

87
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,744
Ted, no talking.

88
00:04:48,217 --> 00:04:49,681
We do know a board member.

89
00:04:54,412 --> 00:04:56,570
Why would anyone
wanna save Kelso's job ?

90
00:04:57,008 --> 00:05:00,753
- For starters... - You know what?
I don't honestly care one way or the other.

91
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,565
- About Kelso?
- Or about anything.

92
00:05:03,623 --> 00:05:06,948
But then again, you two are
young enough and attractive enough

93
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:09,970
that I'm not angry when people assume
we're friends, so what the hell?

94
00:05:10,314 --> 00:05:11,510
Here's what you do.

95
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:13,639
Board members hate confrontation.

96
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:15,337
There's a board meeting tonight.

97
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:18,866
Just show up at the hospital, with all the
movers and shakers in support of Kelso,

98
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:19,992
They'll cave.

99
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:21,608
All right.

100
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,166
Ok. I'll support Kelso.
But in return,

101
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,599
I want you to put me in a full body
cast and take me to the airport.

102
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:30,043
- I'll explain later.
- Why would we do that?

103
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,009
Because I'm the bigger's mover/shaker
in this dump. Come on.

104
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:35,818
You handle this.
And be nice.

105
00:05:36,757 --> 00:05:40,438
All right. Are you familiar
with the term "delusions of grandeur"?

106
00:05:40,863 --> 00:05:42,463
I believe I coined that term.

107
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:45,092
look, I'm a simple, unassuming janitor

108
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,823
who can control people's
actions with his mind.

109
00:05:48,523 --> 00:05:49,357
Observe.

110
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:51,591
Explode!

111
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:57,157
If that would have worked, it would
have freaked you out. You'd loved it!

112
00:05:57,787 --> 00:05:58,469
Fall.

113
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:02,858
Hello?

114
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:08,616
I think this might be the thousandth time
I've peed in a cup for you, doc.

115
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,077
Well, then, to us.

116
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,983
- Hard to celebrate?
- Yeah.

117
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:15,633
I got it.

118
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,677
Jeez Louise, can you believe
how many files I have on this guy?

119
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:24,847
The only way I've been able to
bind them together was with this bi-bond.

120
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:27,213
- Do you hang on that for a second, will you?
- Sure.

121
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:30,083
I don't think he realized
we were making fun of him earlier.

122
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:31,652
Say, what's up
your arm?

123
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,536
Oh, boy.

124
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:43,957
I'm sorry, dude,
that was awesome.

125
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:46,545
Dr Cox we're sorry.

126
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:49,377
Dont' worry tough. Turk and I are
gonna help you diagnose this patient.

127
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,682
That's terrific,
because I'm so darn lost,

128
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,744
I just keep procrastinating.
I check my emails,

129
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:58,077
I pick up a copy of "House weekly"
to see which of my favorite celebs

130
00:06:58,107 --> 00:06:59,636
is bringing back the fedora.

131
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:01,214
It's Johnny Depp,
by the way.

132
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,938
- He doesn't think we could help.
- I look good in a fedora.

133
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,547
Turk, focus. We're being insulted.

134
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:08,609
I'm tired of your not focusing when
someone insults us. It ends up all on me.

135
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:11,141
Hey, if you really wanna be useful

136
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,375
make like an orderly and take
that urine sample down to the lab.

137
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:15,758
Follow me.

138
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:20,292
Money, right?

139
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,201
How does it have anything
to do with what Dr. Cox said?

140
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:24,953
What did Dr. Cox say?

141
00:07:26,558 --> 00:07:28,445
Good afternoon, Mr. Mandelbaum.

142
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,656
Uhm, shouldn't we stop him?

143
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:35,617
Nah, the security guard
will keep him out of traffic.

144
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,113
You know,

145
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:43,014
when I was an intern,
they made us work 60 hours shifts.

146
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:47,946
Yeah, quite a few colleagues got
drummed out because they couldn't cope.

147
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:53,213
The rest of us were so sleep-deprived
we could barely manage to stay sane.

148
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:58,920
I'll never forget the day we caught
Seth Finkel gently cradling a cadaver head

149
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:02,090
which he swore belonged
to his ex-girlfriend, Millie.

150
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:07,773
A year later Seth actually did kill Millie.

151
00:08:08,675 --> 00:08:11,675
Ironically, Millie donated
her body to science

152
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:16,389
and that spring, we caught another
intern cradling her dead head.

153
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,690
Life's little cycles.

154
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:24,546
Oh, boy, that was almost...40 years ago.

155
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:26,362
Sir!

156
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:28,870
Honk!

157
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:30,581
Honk, honk!

158
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:32,280
Honk honk honk!

159
00:08:32,842 --> 00:08:34,729
You tell her, Mandelbaum!

160
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:38,796
Hey, slick.

161
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,444
Will you come to the board
meeting tonight to help Dr. Kelso?

162
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,214
Now why on Earth would I do that?

163
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:46,448
For some reason she thinks if you call
a man "slick" he'll do anything for you.

164
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:48,335
It also works on lesbians, so.

165
00:08:48,452 --> 00:08:49,530
Come on!

166
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:52,636
You know that deep down inside, you're
okay with Kelso running this place.

167
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:56,198
Deep down I hate Bob Kelso
and wish he would die painfully.

168
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:58,248
Here's the research you wanted.

169
00:08:58,424 --> 00:08:59,537
Thanks, slick.

170
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:02,479
Look, Kelso's a pain in the ass.
You know what I say:

171
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,807
Bring on the next pain in the ass.
Hermione!

172
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:09,346
- Have you seen Mr. McRae's urine test?
- I'm on, slick.

173
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:11,912
You don't remember where
you left that cup of pee, do ya?

174
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:14,209
No clue. We have to find
it or he's gonna kill us.

175
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,248
Us? Try you, he's not killing me!

176
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,815
Why is it gettin' harder to...walk?

177
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,619
Uh-oh.

178
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:24,457
Dude!

179
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:28,875
That was lucky!

180
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:32,273
So, have you killed anyone yet?

181
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:33,480
What? No.

182
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,472
Well, you will.

183
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:37,511
Super!

184
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:39,797
It's a rite of passage for doctors.

185
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:45,129
If you're lucky, it'll be a
patient who's on his way out anyway.

186
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:49,547
My first kill was a 19-year-old girl.

187
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:53,695
She came in with severe abdominal pain.

188
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,839
I thought it was appendicitis.

189
00:09:57,105 --> 00:09:58,089
Turned out,

190
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:00,293
she was preagnant and didn't know it.

191
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:04,254
It was ectopic and she
was bleeding internally.

192
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:08,063
I should have checked for that.

193
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,961
But by the time I discovered
my mistake it was too late.

194
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:16,788
Sometimes I look at this whole hospital

195
00:10:16,798 --> 00:10:20,133
I actually see the faces
of all the patients I've lost.

196
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:24,614
- Boogaboogabooga!
-Aaaah!

197
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:28,492
Priceless.

198
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,676
But I do see them sometimes.

199
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:36,461
We don't need Dr. Cox.

200
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:38,834
You know, we'll round up everyone else,
and not just the doctors,

201
00:10:38,858 --> 00:10:40,973
we'll get all the
non-medical personal too.

202
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,482
Good idea! Ted!

203
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,819
Who would you say is the
leader of the support staff?

204
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:52,092
Well well...

205
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,982
Look who has come crawling back,

206
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:56,736
through the desert of shame,
to the oasis of hope.

207
00:10:57,226 --> 00:10:59,075
Begging for just one sip,

208
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:01,677
of cool Janitor forgiveness. Well...

209
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:03,431
the answer's no.

210
00:11:03,556 --> 00:11:05,385
- Please, Janitor!
- All right, I'm in.

211
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:08,377
Dog gone it, I cannot resist
that adorable mug of yours.

212
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:11,219
I'd have to throw a cup of acid on it,
to keep it from having power over me.

213
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:15,904
Ok, so we just have to
round up everyone else.

214
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:17,257
That should be easy.

215
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:20,834
That was impossible.

216
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:23,277
Where did I leave that stupid pee?

217
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:26,496
- Dude, retrace your steps.
- Ok, I remember we were walking this way,

218
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:29,655
and you had to stop Mrs. Butler from
wandering out of her room again.

219
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,750
Oh, no! Mrs. Butler...
Back in here.

220
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:34,826
- Then I got paged to surgery.
- Right!

221
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:37,622
And I came with you to cheer
you on, and I hold your fedora.

222
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:39,979
<i>And then we went out
to the ramp to celebrate.</i>

223
00:11:41,924 --> 00:11:45,042
- There it is.
- Why would it turn purple?

224
00:11:46,512 --> 00:11:47,335
You know,

225
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:51,145
those 2 reminds me of a couple
of dogs I had when I was a boy.

226
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:53,148
JoJo and Spike.

227
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,648
One day JoJo got his head stuck
in the mailbox,

228
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,147
and Spike went over to try to
help him and got his head

229
00:11:59,157 --> 00:12:01,577
wedged in there too and they both suffocated.

230
00:12:02,415 --> 00:12:04,478
They were extremely dumb animals.

231
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:06,131
But close.

232
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,560
Sir, my shift started 2 hours ago,
I should really go.

233
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:16,463
You know, there are some things I sure
as hell will not miss about this place,

234
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:20,543
like how more often than not,
medical skills didn't  matter.

235
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:22,671
It all comes down to dumb luck.

236
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:26,213
- Ok, I'm googling "purple pee".
- Google that bitch!

237
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:27,951
That's it!

238
00:12:28,268 --> 00:12:29,340
We left it in the sun!

239
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,742
If urine exposed to U.V.
light turns purple,

240
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:35,297
it's a sign of a rare genetic disorder
called "Acute Intermittent Porphyria".

241
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:38,588
Sintoms includes bloating,
high blood pressure,

242
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:41,117
seizures... Cox's patient
has all of those.

243
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:44,499
We figured it out.
Ah ah! 1, 2, 3!

244
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,636
- In his faaaaaaaaace!
- In his faaaaaaaaace!

245
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:51,835
...or how you can often have
more questions than answers.

246
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:56,316
I just don't understand why no one
will help us save Kelso's job...

247
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:59,012
That's easy. Word get out that
he wants Kelso gone.

248
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:01,485
And no one wants to cross him
'cause he's a scary guy.

249
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:05,013
Now, I'm not scared of him,
but that's because... I'm magic.

250
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:09,158
- Is he dancing?
- No, no.

251
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:13,787
Or how every day in this place
is made up of little battles.

252
00:13:14,063 --> 00:13:18,688
Or how around here once the ball starts
rolling there's not much you can do to...

253
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:21,651
Sorry, Sir, did you have another?

254
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:27,104
Or how around here, once the ball starts rolling
there's not much you can do to stop it.

255
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,850
He's outta here.

256
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:36,974
Or how patients don't appreciate
their doctors anymore.

257
00:13:37,324 --> 00:13:40,917
Or how medical skills doesn't matter,
it's all just a dumb luck.

258
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:42,691
Oh, you already said that one, sir.

259
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:48,357
Sounds my blood sugar is low, and unless you have
a candy bar in that gay little napsack of yours, shut it!

260
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,970
Or how if you get to the cafeteria past 5,

261
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:54,210
they're always out of pies.

262
00:13:54,297 --> 00:13:55,146
Dammit!

263
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:59,168
What do you buy, like one
pie for the whole hospital?

264
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:03,680
You ask him, if I do that he'll say something
mean over to hurt my feelings.

265
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:06,245
We want you to reconsider helping Kelso.

266
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:08,398
Could I get a "Hell, no!"
from any random doctor?

267
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:10,180
- Hell, no!
- Thank you, whomever.

268
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:13,440
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to go
far, far away from annoying people.

269
00:14:13,445 --> 00:14:18,239
Especially whiny childless blondes
with stainded-coffee teeth.

270
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:21,338
Oh, look at that,
he got you anyway.

271
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:26,272
What the hell is this?

272
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:35,096
What's the occasion? Did Barbie finally
wax her tiny annoying mustache?

273
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,758
Stop saying mean things about me!
I'm not even talking to you!

274
00:14:39,152 --> 00:14:43,116
We diagnosed your patient, buddy.
He's got acute intermittent porphyria.

275
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:45,411
- What?
- If it makes you feel any better,

276
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:47,774
it did almost take us 3 hours.

277
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:49,559
Oh, for the love of God.

278
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:54,731
1985 was going to be my year.

279
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,831
Economics was in folk swing,

280
00:14:57,052 --> 00:14:59,067
Enid's implants
hadn't exploded yet.

281
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:03,218
And best of all, they made me chief
of medicine, so I was the king, right?

282
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:04,494
Wrongo.

283
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:07,972
I realized fast that in order
to keep this whole place going,

284
00:15:07,998 --> 00:15:10,883
I had to make one unpopular
decision after another.

285
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:13,245
Regardless of who hated me for it.

286
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,697
And that was a lonely realization, son.

287
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,219
And here it comes
my biggest fan.

288
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:26,915
Bob, there is finally a diagnosis on Mr.
McCray. He has acute intermittent porphyria.

289
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:29,767
Now his insurance company
wants him discharged immediately,

290
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:31,914
I'd like to fudge the
paperwork a little bit,

291
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,265
keep him around longer and teach
him how to manage his desease.

292
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,816
- No.
- I realize that your heart is made up

293
00:15:37,856 --> 00:15:40,208
mostly of muffin bits, the souls of little babies,

294
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:43,116
and the dental grip you swallow every
time you suck your teeth to get out

295
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:46,087
the muffin bits and baby
souls stuck in there, but

296
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:48,610
What do you care? You're not
being in around anymore!

297
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,098
Dammit, I'm still chief! Now,

298
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,511
if you wanna fusìdge the paperwork,

299
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:55,400
I want a promise from you

300
00:15:55,448 --> 00:15:58,267
that you will publish a paper
on the case. Will you?

301
00:15:58,927 --> 00:15:59,715
Deal.

302
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:02,407
He'll never publish a paper on that case.

303
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:05,654
He knows just ho to play me.

304
00:16:06,304 --> 00:16:10,049
Sure, he likes to pretend that
I win more than he does, but

305
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:13,230
he walks away victorious more often than not.

306
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:17,347
There's got to be a way to
get Dr. Cox to change his mind.

307
00:16:17,615 --> 00:16:19,251
Perry does not sway so easily.

308
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:22,155
Unlike your husband, who'll probably
cave if you'd show him your cans.

309
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:23,861
Don't even have to show him both.

310
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,108
Left one's cooler.

311
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:28,868
- Looks like a sea lion's face.
- It does. Turk drew it for me.

312
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:31,172
Come on, Jordan, think.
There's got to be a way.

313
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:33,087
Oh, my God. Enough.

314
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:35,801
You know, there might be something
I could do to change his mind.

315
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,987
So here's the truth:

316
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:45,986
I was only able to diagnose your patient
when I left his urine outside in the sun,

317
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:47,140
where it turned purple.

318
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:50,948
Then I googled "purple pee", and
the internet gave me the answer.

319
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:52,942
The universe makes sense again.

320
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,806
But, please don't think this is going to
make me change my mind about Kelso.

321
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:00,819
What if I was to sweeten the deal
with a sketch of Carla's boob?

322
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,216
That's an otter!

323
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,623
Even though I knew it was coming, eventually,

324
00:17:08,758 --> 00:17:12,765
it still shocked me when the board said
I had to leave Sacred Heart.

325
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,933
But you know that, don't don't you?

326
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,970
You've been sitting here
listening to me yap all day.

327
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,572
By the way, what's your name, son?

328
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,074
Boone, Sir.

329
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,143
My God, what a ridiculous name.

330
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,947
Boone. Boone.
My name is Boone.

331
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,318
Well, I guess you should go, Boone.

332
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:34,920
Really?

333
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,056
Thank you, Sir.

334
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,029
So... So you think my next 20 years
here will be a nightmare?

335
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:45,864
No.

336
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,834
I think you'll love it.

337
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,043
I have news, Mr. McRae.

338
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,980
You have acute intermittent porphiria.
Now, while that is manageble,

339
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,982
I'm afraid...

340
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,951
There is no cure.

341
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,187
<i>And then we got a respond that
we didn't  expect.</i>

342
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:11,824
Oh, man. I couldn't be happier.

343
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,292
Excuse me?

344
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:17,262
Just knowing what it is, makes it
so much easier to deal with, you know?

345
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,399
<i>And then I saw something click in Dr. Cox.</i>

346
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,802
<i>What Mr. Mc Rae was saying
is that the enemy you know</i>

347
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,570
<i>is always better then the one you don't.</i>

348
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,708
The board meeting is about to start.
It's just the three of you?

349
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,643
I'll probably say a few words as well.

350
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,480
Mostly about the potential of
mind control in modern medicine.

351
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,166
Oh, this should go well.

352
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,684
Wait! There's more people coming!

353
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:39,751
When?

354
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,154
Right now. Love Train!

355
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,134
- Well, you could have made a bigger entrance.
- Let's get this over, before I puke.

356
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,578
Well, Bob, your employees
really stood by you.

357
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,614
- They pointed out to the board that...
- Hey.

358
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:14,553
Well, you run a tight ship,and
actually we'd like you to stay on.

359
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,024
Girls, thank you for saving my job.

360
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:24,997
The one thing I wanted was to end things
on my own terms, and since you're letting me,

361
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,067
you can shove it up your ass, Rodney.

362
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,671
I'm out of here.

363
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:37,276

364
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,514
I'm taking this with me, dammit.

365
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,657
Thanks for everything, Ted.
Sincerely.

366
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,092
You're welcome, sir.

367
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,368
I'm wondering if he even cared
about this place at all.

368
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,304
Yeah.

369
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,072
He did.
