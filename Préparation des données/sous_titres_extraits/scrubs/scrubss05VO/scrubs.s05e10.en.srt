00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,367
- Julie's awesome.
- Doesn't it bother you

166
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,807
- she never laughs?
- What do you mean?

167
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,038
When something's funny,
she never laughs.

168
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:10,707
She just says, "That's so funny."
It's kind of annoying.

169
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,877
[Turk] J.D., this is an intervention.

170
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:18,412
First off, I just want to say,
everyone here loves you.

171
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:22,518
This is a safe space.
But you're such a commit-a-phobe!

172
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,086
Every time you date a girl
with potential,

173
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,327
you wind up ruining it
over some trivial reason.

174
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,768
Think about the great girls
you let slip through your fingers.

175
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,965
Kylie, Jaime, Gift Shop Girl,

176
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:40,502
Minnie McSkinny, Mole Butt,
Tina Two-kids, Rumplefugly...

177
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,872
I'm forgetting someone.

178
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:46,315
<i>[Carla] Oh, my God, Turk.</i>
<i>If you forget Elliot she's gonna cry.</i>

179
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,354
Turk, aren't you forgetting
the greatest girl of them all?

180
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,290
Heidi Horse-Face.

181
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,259
Me, Turk! She's talking about me, OK?

182
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,195
Relax, Elliot. You're Mole Butt.

183
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,129
Really?

184
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,657
Sorry, Turk.

185
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,504
J.D., there's somebody else here
who wants to say something.

186
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,133
Don't mess this up, man. Be smooth.

187
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,140
- Lando's right.
- Billy Dee!

188
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,171
[Mouthing] Lando.

189
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:20,383
Joanna, now I'm not much

190
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,478
for this sensitive crap.

191
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,523
But darn it all, you've found someone

192
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,149
who's willing to
let you annoy them instead of me.

193
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,286
Don't screw up, or you're
gonna end up where you always do,

194
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,060
lying on that couch wishing you
hadn't driven another one away.

195
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,762
If Jordan were conscious,
she'd... she'd agree.

196
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,240
Now who put that fake arrow
through her head?

197
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,208
Huh? Which one of ya?

198
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,910
It was me. I did it.

199
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,144
I gotta get cooking. People are
going to be here for this barbecue.

200
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,246
- Your friends really liked me?
- They're crazy about you.

201
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,086
They're worried I'm gonna mess up.

202
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,922
Nah. You're not gonna be a jerk
and do something like that, are you?

203
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:08,956
The only jerk around here is the spicy
marinade on this Jamaican chicken, mon.

204
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,593
That's so funny.

205
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,231
It is, Julie. It is.
Why do you always do that?

206
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,330
Do what?

207
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,969
You never laugh when something's funny.
You say, "That's so funny."

208
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,807
Does that bother you?

209
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,179
Don't mean to bother anybody.
I'm showing Nurse Martinez around.

210
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:33,089
That's our chief of medicine, that's
a patient and that is you in 20 years.

211
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,861
OK. Let's go look at dead people.

212
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,230
That nurse makes me feel so damn old.

213
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,269
Oh, calm down, Nurse Espinosa.

214
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,965
I have it on good authority
that she's a dude.

215
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,940
I made that stuff up.

216
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:54,742
Then it's time for her to meet
Bob Kelso, licensed hetero.

217
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,719
Sweetie, you're not old.
You don't have crow's feet.

218
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:04,313
Your bra size hasn't gone
from a 34B to a 40 long.

219
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,153
And you don't have arthritis.

220
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,756
Neither do I, but that's how it gets ya.

221
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,162
<i>[Carla] Then Mrs. Wilk said</i>
<i>something that really surprised me.</i>

222
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,360
It's not like you're trying
to get pregnant and you can't.

223
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,104
Actually, I am.

224
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,230
Oh.

225
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:29,376
<i>[Carla] None of us were the least bit</i>
<i>surprised that J.D. Made this happen.</i>

226
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,349
Why is Julie behind that bush crying?

227
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,784
Who knows? Could be anything.

228
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,154
You know what's interesting?
She's not saying, "That's so sad."

229
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,196
She's actually crying.

230
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,754
- You're an idiot.
- Yes, I am.

231
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,597
<i>[Carla] I tried, but I just couldn't</i>
<i>get babies off my mind.</i>

232
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,473
Excuse me, fellas. Gotta take a whiz.

233
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,513
Wait a minute. Why am I rushing?

234
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,012
All right.

235
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,554
You're disgusting.

236
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,355
She's right. I am disgusting.

237
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,432
I'm disgustingly incapable
of carrying on a relationship

238
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,160
with someone I actually like.

239
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,759
I apologized to her,
so I think we're cool for now,

240
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,772
but it won't last. Every time
she says, "That's so funny,"

241
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,172
it's like nails on a chalkboard to me.

242
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,405
- You're too picky with women.
- You used to be the same way.

243
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,344
You got over it and you're married.

244
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,177
'Cause I was never as bad as you.

245
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,774
Oh, really?
Remember "Whitney the Snapper?"

246
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:40,910
[Sighs]

247
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,583
Hey. I just wanted
to say thanks for dinner tonight.

248
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,594
And for dessert you're gonna
get a little Whitney...

249
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,027
...à la mode.

250
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,493
Get out.

251
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,327
Too much.

252
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:01,200
You've been off the pill two months.
Why are you getting a fertility test?

253
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,208
<i>[Carla] Because I'm old</i>
<i>and the crock pot is on the fritz.</i>

254
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,608
- No reason.
- Carla Espinosa?

255
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,772
- Yes.
- Dr. Matthews will see you now.

256
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,748
- Great.
- Oh.

257
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,842
OK, he is super cute.

258
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,286
So do not look into his eyes.
You could get lost.

259
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,483
I'll be fine.

260
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,386
Ask him if he remembers me
from my pelvic exam!

261
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,260
[EIliot] Ask him!

262
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,402
I made popcorn. Ah!

263
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,707
You OK, sweetness?

264
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,743
- I'll go make some more.
- All right.

265
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:42,007
- Why are we watching a movie?
- It's called immersion therapy.

266
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,275
What we're about to watch
will make her say

267
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,218
"that's so funny" so many times that
eventually it's not gonna bother you.

268
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,517
How can you guarantee
she's gonna laugh?

269
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,615
I can't. But Uncle Buck can.

270
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,658
That's so funny.

271
00:14:56,462 --> 00:15:00,523
That's so funny. Look how big
that pancake is! That's so funny.

272
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,762
[Whispering] Make her stop!

273
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,168
That's so funny!

274
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,172
[Groaning]

275
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,271
<i>[Carla] This guy's not that hot.</i>

276
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,368
You've only been trying
for two months,

277
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,913
so I don't think you need
a fertility test yet.

278
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,915
Unless, of course, you're over 35.

279
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:21,350
<i>[Carla] Well, buddy,</i>
<i>I'm 36 and OK with it.</i>

280
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,387
So how old are you?

281
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,323
<i>[Carla] Ravish me.</i>

282
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,258
I'm 29.

283
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,091
I've been seeing a lot of 29-year-olds.

284
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,165
- Oh, my God, really?
- Yeah. Like her.

285
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,234
Call me J.J.

286
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,831
- Immersion therapy didn't work.
- Dude, relax.

287
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:47,675
I was a psych minor in college. The
next time she says, "That's so funny,"

288
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,147
I want you to pretend she's says,
"That's so money."

289
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,047
Ooh, I like that.

290
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:57,578
Yeah. It's called
word replacement... ism.

291
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,726
This is the dumbest conversation.

292
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,728
You should hear this one.

293
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,099
I remember my first exam
with Dr. Matthews.

294
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:12,934
He said, "You're healthy down there."
And then I said, "Right back at you."

295
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,168
And then there was this weird
little awkward pause, so I said,

296
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:22,111
"I like to keep a clean shop." And then
he asked to see my insurance card.

297
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,649
So, how did your fertility test go?

298
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,776
Everything is A-OK.

299
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,979
[Both] Oh, that's bull!

300
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,148
- Excuse me, sir?
- I was talking to these ladies.

301
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,886
I was talking to you ladies.
Newbie, listen to me.

302
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,588
You never stop being annoyed
by the little things.

303
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:42,362
Take Gandhi here. Your wife
is the bossiest woman I've ever met.

304
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,403
Are you trying to tell me that
you're not bothered by that?

305
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,996
Sometimes I watch <i>Roots</i>
to remind myself how good I have it.

306
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,234
Me too.

307
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,039
Everyone is annoying.
I mean, take Jordan.

308
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,808
She is just now returning
from what I can only assume

309
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,714
is her eleventh
gynecological visit this month.

310
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:02,811
I'm saving my breast exam
for when you go away next month.

311
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:06,153
Upsetting, but we persevere.
Bottom line:

312
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,319
There is no such thing
as a perfect person. You. Tell her.

313
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:15,363
All right. If you found someone who
makes you happy by just sitting around

314
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:19,393
and holding hands, then eventually
all that other stuff won't matter.

315
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,836
Mmm.

316
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,238
- Dude, not me.
- I know.

317
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:27,176
Nurse Espinosa, I know
you didn't take that fertility test.

318
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,612
People think I am
some clueless old geezer,

319
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,242
but nothing that happens
in these hallways gets by me.

320
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,411
It wasn't me. I didn't do it!

321
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,216
If I take that fertility test

322
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,225
and I find out that I missed my window
to have a kid I'll never forgive myself.

323
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,193
If you're worried about your legacy,

324
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,527
as the father of a son who not only
wrote a musical based on my life

325
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,761
but is shacked up
with the actor playing me, honestly,

326
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:53,531
it's not all it's cracked up to be.
But I know you.

327
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:57,871
You'll find out eventually, so why
don't you just turn around and tell him?

328
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,372
Oh.

329
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,973
Dr. Matthews.

330
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,252
- I'm 36.
- Oh.

331
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:14,224
Well, let's get you that fertility test.
Follow me.

332
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,590
OK.

333
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,288
<i>[Carla] Here goes nothing.</i>

334
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,265
[J.D. Laughing] One-A-Day Vitamins?

335
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,826
I tell you how they could double
their profits. Two-a-Day Vitamins.

336
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,565
That's so funny.

337
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:32,234
I'm sorry I said, "That's so funny."
I know that drives you crazy.

338
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,007
You know what?

339
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,317
I really couldn't care less.

340
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,621
So, what do we do now?

341
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,453
I don't know.
We've already got the half acre, right?

342
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:50,222
I imagine we'll eventually be able
to build a house on it. Backyard.

343
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,560
Room for a Slip 'N Slide for our kids,
Gilligan and the Skipper.

344
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,692
I know. I'm sorry. I gotta do it.
I lost a bet to Turk.

345
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,794
And I don't want to rush things,
but I feel good about this.

346
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:04,309
I don't know. I feel like...
you and I could go the distance.

347
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:08,938
Um, actually, I meant what do you want
to order from take-out for dinner.

348
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,379
Oh.

349
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,350
- Tapas.
- I love tapas.

350
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,942
- Sharing.
- Sharing is fun.

351
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,183
- I love it. Just share.
- Share.

352
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,785
So you really don't think
about that kind of stuff?

353
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:26,695
J.D., I'm only 23. I don't even know
if I want any of that stuff.

354
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,700
And certainly not
for the next five or ten years.

355
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:30,735
You know what?

356
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:35,068
We just started dating, so this
conversation goes down a bad road.

357
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,665
Why don't we say we're never
gonna talk about it.

358
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:38,869
- OK.
- OK.

359
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:42,505
- [Laughing] OK. Phew.
- OK.

360
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,548
[# Cary Brothers: <i>Ride]</i>

361
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,411
So you really feel that way?

362
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,946
And here I am again.

363
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:54,583
I can't believe I broke up with her.
Why do I keep doing this?

364
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,628
J.D., this was totally different.

365
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,561
You didn't break up
because she said, "That's so funny"

366
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,861
or she sang Christmas carols
in the summer.

367
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,835
It was August.
The weather was far from frightful.

368
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:08,771
You broke up with her for a real reason.
Right, Carla?

369
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,865
Definitely.

370
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,309
<i>[Carla] Oh, my God,</i>
<i>what did I just agree to?</i>

371
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,880
<i>All I can think about</i>
<i>is getting my test results.</i>

372
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,974
<i>I have to get out of my head.</i>
<i>Just say something positive.</i>

373
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,384
She's a keeper, J.D.
You'll never do better.

374
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:25,787
<i>[J.D.] I guess it's human nature</i>
<i>to worry about the future.</i>

375
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,792
<i>Especially when we think</i>
<i>our dreams might not come true.</i>

376
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,690
Thanks. Thanks, Dr. Matthews.
That's great news.

377
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,658
Turk!

378
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,760
- Yeah, baby.
- Get over here.

379
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,102
[Laughing] Yeah!

380
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,639
[Gong crashes]

381
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,840
Yeah, buddy!

382
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,881
<i>[J.D.] As for my future,</i>

383
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:58,013
<i>I had finally gotten to the place where</i>
<i>I was looking for the right person.</i>

384
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,615
<i>And I knew she was out there.</i>

385
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,855
<i>Even if I couldn't quite see her yet.</i>
