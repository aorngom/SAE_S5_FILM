1
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:07,802
<i>[J.D.] Now that Elliot and Keith were</i>
<i>serious, she started buying him gifts.</i>

2
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,136
[Laughs]

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,871
It's a mouth harp! Oh, awesome!

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,904
<i>[J.D.] Keith was shockingly good</i>
<i>at pretending to like crappy presents.</i>

5
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:17,609
<i>But you know what he was best at?</i>

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,152
Keith, we need more popcorn, yeah.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,484
<i>[J.D.] Being girl bait.</i>

8
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,590
<i>Here's how it goes down.</i>

9
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:29,993
<i>Keith comes back, Elliot marks her</i>
<i>territory so the girls know he's taken,</i>

10
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:33,362
<i>and I pick off one of the smaller ones</i>
<i>that comes by for a look-see.</i>

11
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,333
I'm a doctor.

12
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,029
I'm a landowner.

13
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,128
Burt Reynolds is my father.

14
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,172
I love sports.

15
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,269
Keith, more popcorn.

16
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,079
[Spring boings]

17
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,412
See, that's how it works.

18
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,510
You have the cutest hair.

19
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,021
These old rags?

20
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,958
OK, OK. So you're both... fertile,

21
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:07,796
yet you're still unable to conceive,
so... How often do you make love?

22
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,961
- Twice today.
- Actually, it was three times.

23
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,665
You were asleep for the last one.

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,708
- Wow. That really happened?
- Mm-hm.

25
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,573
It was weird that you
were in one of my sex dreams.

26
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,614
He is not allowed to dream about me.
It gets too freaky.

27
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,478
Cirque du Soleil freaky.

28
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,018
One time, she was skinless.

29
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,920
OK. Stress is often
a factor in conception.

30
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:34,153
So tell me, do you think
stress might be an issue?

31
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,530
I swear,
if you don't knock me up tonight,

32
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:42,967
there's no more sex until you steal
me a baby. So do it right this time.

33
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,236
There's a little stress.

34
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,071
OK, the antibiotics
have brought your fever down.

35
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,939
Is there anything else I can do?

36
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:56,175
Yeah, I'm auditioning for
my church's senior citizen production

37
00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:00,618
of <i>Streetcar Named Desire.</i>
Would you mind running lines with me?

38
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,621
I'd be happy to.

39
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:08,252
"If I didn't know you was my
wife's sister, I'd get ideas about you."

40
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:14,198
I can't believe you think
I'd do this with you. Are you insane?

41
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,235
Seriously, I'm a doctor.

42
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,701
What page are you on?

43
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,328
Oh...

44
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,167
Why didn't you just read lines
with the old guy?

45
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,404
My job is to make sick people better,

46
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:29,881
not to help Bernie score a slice
of Episcopalian tail on opening night.

47
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,816
Sometimes, you got
to go the extra mile with patients.

48
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,377
That's what makes me
such a special doctor.

49
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:39,186
That and your amazing ability
to switch back and forth seamlessly

50
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,124
between male and female genitalia.

51
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,128
Ooh...

52
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,963
Newbie, snap out of it.
We don't have time for your daydreaming.

53
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,400
I believe medicine
is about more than treating the disease.

54
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,030
You've got to be there for people.
Take Mrs. Cohen.

55
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,267
When she broke her hip, I treated that.

56
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,241
She also left her car double-parked,

57
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,212
so being an "extra mile" kind of guy,
I went and took care of it.

58
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,683
Sorry. It's been a little while
since I drove stick.

59
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:16,318
Wonder how she got out of that truck?
That's how she broke her hip.

60
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,064
# <i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

61
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,500
# <i>No, I know</i>
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

62
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,708
# <i>I'm no Superman</i> #

63
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,847
All I'm saying is it's important
to go the extra mile with patients.

64
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,973
It's like I was telling this girl.

65
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,608
- Why tell her?
- I didn't.

66
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,846
I wanted to show you
who I'm going out with.

67
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,220
Look, Newbie, there's a reason that I
can't go the extra mile with patients.

68
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,454
- It's something personal.
- You can confide in me.

69
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,463
I'm a good doctor. Kelly Ripa!

70
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,501
<i>[J.D.] It didn't bother me</i>
<i>Dr. Cox had "Kelly Ripa'd" me,</i>

71
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,029
<i>because I knew it would never catch on,</i>
<i>no matter how much he wanted it to.</i>

72
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,473
<i>This, however, did upset me.</i>

73
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:07,445
Uh, Carol, we got the
bone marrow biopsy back and, uh...

74
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,778
...I'm afraid you have leukemia.

75
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,545
What?

76
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,511
Yes. But the good news
is it's very treatable.

77
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,489
We have to get started right away.

78
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:24,196
In four and a half years,
I've watched your pal, Stephanie,

79
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,458
go through a multitude
of irritating fads:

80
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,330
UGG boots, campaign
for better grammar among staff

81
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,563
and the double European air-kiss.

82
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,606
Seeing as you are sorority sisters,

83
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:38,372
I was hoping you'd be able to tell me
when this "extra mile" crap will end.

84
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,605
Oh, it's never gonna end.
He's relentless.

85
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,876
Why do you think I was out Sunday
buying comics for my patient?

86
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:49,944
They're giving away free Tastykakes
at the comic book store? Ha-ha!

87
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,253
That worked better
when you were a fat load.

88
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,758
- I know.
- Damn it!

89
00:04:55,995 --> 00:05:00,056
All right, Jake, here it is,
the latest <i>Vengeance.</i>

90
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,294
I had to travel to five stores
to find that.

91
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,302
This is last month's.

92
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,338
I'll track down the new one for you,

93
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,374
but right now, I got to make
sure I have a job next year, OK?

94
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:13,208
<i>[J.D.] Since there were only three</i>
<i>attending spots for ten residents,</i>

95
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,409
<i>Dr. Kelso could basically treat them</i>
<i>like his own personal valets.</i>

96
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:45,173
All-day sucker, my ass. Try 20 minutes.

97
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,541
Sir, quick question.

98
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,706
[Gulping] Make it very quick.
I'm about to vomit.

99
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:53,218
Why was I told to drop everything
and look after some new patient?

100
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,551
Mr. Sommer is the cousin
of one of the trustees.

101
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,182
Not important enough
to warrant face time with me,

102
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,557
but connected enough that
if one of these ding-dongs kills him,

103
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,392
- it'll be my ass.
- Carla, can you cover my patients?

104
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,229
- She's watching someone for me.
- I'll find somebody.

105
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,303
Because I'm just a nurse,
I can't look after everybody?

106
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,770
- Precisely.
- J.D., why don't you tell me

107
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,276
what's wrong with Mrs. Jones?
Without looking at a chart.

108
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,643
<i>[J.D.] Carla knew, without charts,</i>
<i>doctors didn't know much about patients.</i>

109
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:26,648
Mr. Barry, I misplaced your chart.
I forgot, what's wrong with you again?

110
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:32,348
Oh, that's right. You have
a kitty cat stuck in your mouth.

111
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:36,361
Or should I say you have
a person stuck around you, little guy?

112
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,260
Cootchie-cootchie.

113
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,492
It's not like nurses know everything.

114
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,967
<i>[J.D.] Uh-oh. Carla's gearing up</i>
<i>to explode. Save yourself.</i>

115
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,561
<i>Attempt the casual side-switch.</i>

116
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,130
<i>And you're there. Now angry at Kelso.</i>

117
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,642
- Bob, how dare you?
- Exactly.

118
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,804
You're worried
about what I can handle?

119
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,576
Vascular Surgery wants
an update every two hours,

120
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,618
I'm weaning Mrs. Jones' dopamine
from ten mikes to five,

121
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,880
Meyerson's abdominal wound is dehiscing

122
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,515
and Mr. Wilder is turfed to Psych.
He thinks he's Flo from <i>Alice.</i>

123
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,525
Kiss my grits!

124
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,289
Exactly, Flo! Exactly!

125
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,328
I hope you learned something today.

126
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,493
Get a load of
Mr. Extra Mile Guy's leukemia patient,

127
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,540
sitting in there all by herself.

128
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:26,544
He's probably out getting a cake shaped
like a cancerous white blood cell.

129
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,672
All right, team, let's stay close.
Come on.

130
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:34,311
Carol! Look who I found.

131
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,288
Larry? Dad? How?

132
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,722
Well, right after
I got your test results back,

133
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:43,592
I got on the horn with your dad and we
started a phone tree to find everyone.

134
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:47,188
There were some tears,
mostly mine, but we got it done.

135
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,734
You are the most amazing doctor.

136
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,770
Hear that, Perry?

137
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:57,299
I'm the most amazing doctor
because I went the extra 5,280 feet.

138
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,470
What's that? That's right, it's a mile.

139
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,844
And how does that makes me feel? Keith!

140
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,280
[Mouth harp boings]

141
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,011
Thank you.

142
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:13,449
Attention, surgical residents
still hoping to have a job next year.

143
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,154
The annual blood drive is upon us

144
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,131
and I will be needing
a volunteer to greet our donors

145
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,667
as the hospital's new mascot,

146
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:26,398
the friendly hypodermic needle,
Mr. Prick.

147
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,506
We'll probably change the name.

148
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:36,980
I'm so sick of this. If the jobs were
given to whoever is the best surgeon,

149
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,313
I would get all three
of those damn spots.

150
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,910
It's the same on medical.
The only reason I got

151
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,889
that oncology rotation
is I let Dr. Morgan take me

152
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,425
- to his brother's wedding.
- Ricky Morgan?

153
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,524
- He works in the cafeteria.
- What?!

154
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,463
- What.
- Listen, kissing ass

155
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,469
is just the way it's done around here,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

156
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,997
We have to all band together and
agree not to be exploited by Dr. Kelso.

157
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:06,636
From now on, we will only be judged by
our skill and abilities. Who's with me?

158
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,407
That's right! That's right!

159
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,211
From here on out,
no more getting him coffee,

160
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,013
no more washing his car,

161
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:18,113
no more taking his son
to the local steam baths to meet men.

162
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,488
Well, hey, you guys got him coffee.

163
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,892
"Together" on three. One, two, three.

164
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,862
- Together!
- Let's go!

165
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,124
What are you doing?

166
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,759
Chief of medicine said
to pay special attention,

167
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,702
and I take a couple of seconds
to get to know my patients.

168
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,263
So, first question,
are you allergic to any...?

169
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,002
[Janitor] Psst!

170
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,237
- What?
- I need some advice.

171
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,511
- Which do you prefer?
- What's the occasion?

172
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,051
Me wiping up gunk.

173
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,247
I was cleaning Kelso's tie rack
and I assumed I could have it.

174
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,291
The Armani is very affective on urine,

175
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,521
- whereas the Yves Saint Laurent is...
- No, no.

176
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,687
What? Where'd he go?

177
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,196
<i>[J.D.] Carol's family welcomed me</i>
<i>as one of their own.</i>

178
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,031
<i>No more than her brother, Larry.</i>

179
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,038
- Eagle!
- I told you not to call me Lawrence.

180
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,802
And I told you I never get dizzy.

181
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:14,203
OK. Let me tell you guys
why we are here.

182
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,181
Carol is starting a journey, OK?

183
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:21,185
Obviously, the chemo is gonna be
tough, but we're all here for you.

184
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,416
Anything you go through,
we go through together.

185
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,193
So you've all banded together.

186
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:34,221
I honestly never thought I'd see the day
when we would pick the three surgeons

187
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,260
who would care for people of this
great hospital based solely on merit.

188
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,397
I hope you're proud of yourselves.

189
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:46,344
This is a preliminary ranking
of your technical skills.

190
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,540
So whenever you get a chance...

191
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,709
<i>[J.D.] Life in a hospital</i>
<i>is constantly humbling.</i>

192
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,481
<i>Whether it's making you realize</i>
<i>you're not as skilled as you thought...</i>

193
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,820
Fourth?! I'm fourth?

194
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,862
<i>... or as on the ball as you thought.</i>

195
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,091
- How's Mr. Sommer doing?
- Actually, sir...

196
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,726
He's perfectly fine, sir.
He's in tiptop shape.

197
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,496
Good.

198
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,334
Ow! What, are you wearing, a cup?

199
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,967
People try to hit me there
more than you'd think.

200
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,578
[Tapping]

201
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,913
<i>[J.D.] The key is to be ready for it.</i>

202
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,644
I was not ready for this.

203
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,583
Since Carol is gonna lose her hair,

204
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:31,783
we decided we'd all shave our heads now.
He even agreed to do the cutting.

205
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,824
You're up next, big guy.

206
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,155
I mean, come on.
You're all in this together, right?

207
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,595
[Whirring]

208
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,602
I can't believe
you all shaved your heads.

209
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,936
How great. Even Nana.

210
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,136
And you don't look creepy
or alien-like at all.

211
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,577
Are you ready to run the extra mile?

212
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,411
<i>[J.D.] You can't let him know</i>
<i>you don't want to do this.</i>

213
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,485
<i>Meet his gaze. Meet it twice as hard!</i>

214
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,180
Dr. Dorian, we need you.

215
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,484
Mr. Bentley's condition
is getting worse.

216
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,582
<i>[J.D.] God bless his herpes.</i>

217
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,355
I'm gonna go take care of that man.
When I come back...

218
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,659
<i>[J.D.] Pause for effect.</i>
<i>Pause for effect.</i>

219
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,599
...we're gonna shave this thing.
- Yeah!

220
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,432
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

221
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,466
How the hell could I be fourth?!

222
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,304
I know Bonnie's good
and Figsack has mad hands,

223
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,937
but somehow, I keep forgetting
that Todd is a skilled surgeon.

224
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,573
How come you didn't page me
about that consult?

225
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,618
I did. You're wearing
your garage door opener on your hip.

226
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,548
Ladies and gentlemen, number two.

227
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,756
Kelso's gonna kill me.
I can't find Mr. Sommer.

228
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,593
Did you look
between Mr. Spring and Mr. Fall?

229
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,428
- Too easy.
- Hey, you know...?

230
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,660
- More armor?
- No.

231
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:55,435
Actually, I am sneaking trays out
of the cafeteria. I'm building a shed.

232
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,602
This is partially your fault,
so you're gonna help me.

233
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:02,977
You know, whenever I lose something
in the morgue, I just retrace my steps.

234
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,016
Right now,
I'm looking for something,

235
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,211
and I know I came
to the vending machine,

236
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,449
then I dropped a quarter,
which rolled over here,

237
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,218
and, yep, there you are.

238
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,920
As soon as you take your eyes off 'em,
you lose 'em.

239
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,294
They're like children.
Big dead children.

240
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:27,094
I treated that girl at the free clinic.
She was born without nipples.

241
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,108
I knew there had to be something wrong!
She's too perfect.

242
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:34,704
I was kidding, J.D. I have never
seen her in my life. Kelly Ripa!

243
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,717
- I told you it would catch on.
- I don't think it's funny.

244
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,979
How's that leukemia patient doing?

245
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,216
I'm hiding.
I really don't want to be bald.

246
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,259
I have a suspicion
it won't work for me.

247
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,294
It might accentuate my spoon-chest.

248
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,329
- Yeah.
- Plus, the girl I'm dating

249
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,456
is totally into my hair.

250
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,501
She's got to be interested
in more than just your hair.

251
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,733
If it weren't for your hair, I don't
think I'd be remotely interested in you.

252
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,502
I'm sure there's
something else she's into.

253
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,942
No, there's nothing else.

254
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,980
There is. Even if she won't admit it.

255
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,744
You know what, I'm stuck.
I have to shave this down.

256
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:15,947
You don't have to go the extra mile.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

257
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,854
What happened to the days
when you used to listen to me?

258
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,484
That was a long time ago.
You should listen to me.

259
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,687
Not in this lifetime.

260
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,629
Listen, Newbie,

261
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,430
you're not a completely, terribly,
horrible, incompetent doctor.

262
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,596
While I would never let
any blood relatives be your patient,

263
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,368
if it was someone that I knew,
an acquaintance,

264
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,933
I might be OK with you treating them.

265
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,740
Thank you.

266
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,271
The only thing you owe Carol
is to treat her the best you can.

267
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,353
Hey, where you been?

268
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:53,084
Oh, Larry, man.
I don't think I can shave my head.

269
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,591
What about Carol?

270
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,187
She'll be OK. She has all you guys.

271
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,204
- You look over there.
- Mm-hm.

272
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,336
Excuse me, nurse.

273
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,412
Hi! How 'bout a poke?

274
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,043
I have a husband, OK?
And he's big and he's black and...

275
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:24,419
Baby, baby, it's me! But I do love
that you go to that big and black stuff.

276
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,220
I can't wait to bear
the fruit of your loins.

277
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,658
Baby, wait!

278
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,494
This is the only way I can suck up
to Kelso without the surgeons knowing.

279
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,726
There you are.

280
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,667
- You're not Mr. Sommer.
- No, I'm not.

281
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,398
No harm done.

282
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,471
What's up... with y'all?

283
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,779
[Turk] Ahh!

284
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,989
Hey, Dr. Turk. What happened to you?

285
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,787
I found the latest issue

286
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,623
at a comic book store
a mile and a half away. Here you go.

287
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:09,032
Actually, I ran there in a
foam needle suit, but you don't care.

288
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,068
Thanks, Dr. Turk.

289
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:17,168
Christopher,
I heard you were sweating the rankings.

290
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,871
No. I'm married
and trying to have a baby.

291
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,847
Not having a job
would be a big boost for me.

292
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:28,080
You're a good surgeon. Plus,
your bedside manner is really important.

293
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,714
There's no one on that list who
spends more time with their patients.

294
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,951
Are you saying I have a job?

295
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:39,798
If you are trying to "Kelly Ripa" me
right now, I will freak out.

296
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,993
I got a job!

297
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,876
Well, the good news is,
his head isn't in the storage room.

298
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,311
I once found a head. It's a funny story.
I put it in my locker.

299
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,680
I didn't have time to get
to Lost and Found, forgot all about it.

300
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,584
Come back to work on Monday,
open my locker, whoa! Head!

301
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:04,315
Plus rats! I panicked.
I didn't know what to do.

302
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,950
I grabbed the thing
and ran up to the roof, punt it,

303
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,687
and I shank it wide-left.

304
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,527
It's heading straight down, right
for Kelso sitting in his convertible.

305
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,623
I'm done.
I'm out of a job, right? Wrong.

306
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,828
At that second, a hawk flies in,

307
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,871
grabs the thing and flies off with it.

308
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,669
I know what you're thinking. We're
in a city. What's a hawk doing there?

309
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,803
I can't believe you get a locker
and I don't.

310
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,440
Dr. Reid, I need
to meet you in Radiology

311
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,107
to go over some test results.

312
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,618
Yeah, it's over, Ricky.

313
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,923
I know you're stealing trays. Stop it.

314
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,891
Buzz off.

315
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,723
Carla, the orderly
lost my chart for Mr. Tyler in 406.

316
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,387
Would we have his dosages?

317
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:49,423
You put him on penicillin, but he was
allergic, so you put him on vancomycin.

318
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:50,661
Thank you.

319
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,735
Wish you put some of that crazy-nurse
memory to use on our missing dude.

320
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,440
Well, he was an older guy

321
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:03,880
and he was on an IV,
so he couldn't have gotten very far.

322
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:09,012
He was jittery and he had this
weird circle tan line on his arm.

323
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,780
It was the nicotine patch.
He was trying to quit smoking.

324
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,420
Should I not be out here?

325
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,896
There he is, Mr. Spot on His Lungs.

326
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,234
Don't worry, we'll pop that lung out,

327
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,537
get it to the dry cleaners
and have it back to you after five.

328
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,102
We like to have fun.

329
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,139
I made up that whole hawk story.

330
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:41,117
Yeah. I know you're not as weird
as you want people to think you are.

331
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,744
[Clangs]

332
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,814
[# Tammany Hall NYC: <i>Someone</i>]

333
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,268
Whoa! Nana! How you doing?

334
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,601
Looking hot in the tracksuit.
Gym's on the second floor.

335
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,141
<i>[J.D.] Date time.</i>

336
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,802
Dude. There you are. Two things.

337
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,347
First, aliens are here
wearing tracksuits.

338
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,906
- Oh, no, that's Nana.
- Second... I got a job.

339
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,646
- Nice.
- If you hadn't pushed me

340
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,780
to do that extra mile stuff,
that wouldn't have happened,

341
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,619
so thank you.

342
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:23,183
You got a hottie waiting for you
at the bar. You go get her!

343
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,424
- Where were we?
- Do I smell banana conditioner?

344
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,560
That's one of my conditioners, yes.

345
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:37,966
<i>[J.D.] As great as this was, I couldn't</i>
<i>stop thinking about what Turk said...</i>

346
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,773
<i>This girl really digs hair.</i>

347
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,805
<i>It's hard getting what happens</i>
<i>at the hospital out of your head.</i>

348
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,015
Ah!

349
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,480
How was your first stress-free day?

350
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,888
Horrible. You?

351
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,926
Worse.

352
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,154
Let's make a baby.

353
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,958
If it doesn't work this time,
I'll kill myself.

354
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,425
Not helping with the stress.

355
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,433
<i>[J.D.] I knew if I didn't</i>
<i>leave that bar and go back,</i>

356
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,273
<i>I'd never be able</i>
<i>to enjoy any of the simple things,</i>

357
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,109
<i>even a woman eating my former bangs.</i>

358
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,148
Voilà.

359
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,410
[Cheering]

360
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,246
<i>See, that's the thing</i>
<i>about being an extra mile guy.</i>

361
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,586
<i>You never know</i>
<i>who it's gonna rub off on.</i>

362
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:29,889
"Sister Blanche, I've got
a little birthday remembrance for you."

363
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,398
[High pitched Southern accent]
"Oh, have you, Stanley?

364
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,626
I wasn't expecting any."

365
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,670
- "I hope you like it."
- Aw...

366
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,639
- You're hating this, aren't you?
- No, that's not it at all.

367
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,871
I don't believe for a second
that you really want me to leave.

368
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,310
You gotta feel it, Lyle.
Get involved.

369
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,872
What do you people say?
Let's take it from the top?

370
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,819
"Sister Blanche, I've got
a little birthday remembrance for you."

371
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,652
Again. Do it with some force.
