1
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:05,726
Can I trade clipboards with you?

2
00:00:05,912 --> 00:00:08,745
OK, fine. But mine's better.

3
00:00:09,874 --> 00:00:13,787
- You wanna trade?
- I guess. OK.

4
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:18,648
- Elliot, have you seen my clipboard?
- No.

5
00:00:18,883 --> 00:00:23,752
This'll be fun.
JD, I would like you to meet JD.

6
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:27,411
- How's it going, man?
- Make him leave.

7
00:00:27,642 --> 00:00:30,395
Are you bummed
that we have the same name?

8
00:00:30,603 --> 00:00:34,642
I'll tell you what. You're older
than I am, so you were JD first.

9
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,049
So, how about
you'll be JD Number One,

10
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:39,623
and I'll just be JD Number Two?

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,936
How about that?

12
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:44,230
Hey, Number Two.

13
00:00:44,408 --> 00:00:47,400
Hey, Number One.
I got one more patient.

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,295
You wanna have lunch
and bring my clipboard?

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,576
- Hey, Number Two.
- Number One!

16
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:55,104
All right. Cool.

17
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:57,369
- Hey, Number Two.
- Number One!

18
00:00:57,546 --> 00:01:00,697
<i>The best part about working here</i>
<i>is the patients.</i>

19
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:03,803
<i>When they see how much you care,</i>
<i>they're grateful.</i>

20
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:06,206
About time, idiot.

21
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:09,506
Mr Simon, good morning.
How are you feeling?

22
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:12,034
I was just asking Nurse Fajita

23
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:15,106
if you get extra points
for stupid questions.

24
00:01:15,314 --> 00:01:18,511
- I was trying to assess...
- Bambi, don't bother.

25
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:23,285
Sir, if there's anything we can
do to make your stay more comfortable...

26
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:26,007
You can kiss my man-sized ass.

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,397
Will you hold me after?

28
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:35,456
Maybe we shouldn't bother.

29
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:52,264
Hey, Number Two!

30
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:54,426
- Hey, Number One.
- Hey, Number Two.

31
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:58,392
Bambi, Mr Simon
made one of the night nurses cry?

32
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,446
- Which one?
- Frank.

33
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,601
Frank was a Navy SEAL.

34
00:02:02,778 --> 00:02:04,769
- Hey, Number Two!
- Hey, Number One.

35
00:02:04,947 --> 00:02:07,142
You are brave.
You're an attending here.

36
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:09,885
You're dating a student,
and holding hands.

37
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:13,353
Normally I wouldn't do this,
but there are mitigating factors.

38
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:16,857
- Like what?
- For starters, you are very hot.

39
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:22,143
I have kind of a special
evening planned for us.

40
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:24,497
I'm not gonna
give away everything,

41
00:02:24,675 --> 00:02:28,111
but I will say it involves wine,
an amazing dinner

42
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:31,543
and a safety word
we've agreed upon in advance.

43
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:38,611
You are gonna make a great mom!

44
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:41,768
I told you what to do
if the stitches start to itch.

45
00:02:41,984 --> 00:02:44,544
- Don't scratch.
- Unless they're really itchy.

46
00:02:44,737 --> 00:02:48,047
And then you go to town.
You go nuts. You do your thing.

47
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:53,231
Dr Reid! One of the nurses found
your stethoscope in the bathroom.

48
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:55,129
Thank you so much, sir.

49
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:58,486
This isn't it.
I had them leave yours where it was.

50
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,464
Let's try to be a little
more responsible, shall we?

51
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:07,510
- I went to college with that guy.
- Lucky you.

52
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,320
Used to play his guitar
every Saturday night

53
00:03:10,513 --> 00:03:13,505
at this coffeehouse off campus.

54
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:18,400
- Remember the guy's name?
- Robby something, I think.

55
00:03:18,688 --> 00:03:23,284
Dr Kelso's name is Bob, short for Robert
and Robby is a nickname for Robert!

56
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:25,205
Like, oh, my God!

57
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:29,195
Give him 30 milligrams of MS Contin.
Why do I have to come with you?

58
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:31,643
Because you're kinda like a doctor.

59
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:34,056
He's just another patient.

60
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:39,114
- Simon says, ''Hello!''
- What the hell do you want?

61
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:43,092
Just gonna have Carla give you
a stronger pain medication.

62
00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:46,295
- Beat it, junior.
- Toodles.

63
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:50,731
You're all mine.

64
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:53,965
Me no likey mean guys.

65
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:56,695
Have you seen my stethoscope?

66
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,962
No. Maybe you left it
in one of the girls' bathrooms.

67
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:03,949
What?

68
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:06,019
Is that my stethoscope?

69
00:04:06,193 --> 00:04:08,024
This is mine.

70
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:10,834
It's getting hot, Red Bird.
Pull me out.

71
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:13,473
Kristen, slow down.

72
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:16,416
You've no idea how many times
you'll say that tonight.

73
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:19,215
- You're making it hard.
- You'll say that too.

74
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:23,693
Kristen, something has come up,
and I won't be able to make it tonight.

75
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:25,952
- What?
- I know. I'm sorry.

76
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,928
But it's important.
It's very important.

77
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:32,011
Thank you for giving me a ride
to pick up my dresser.

78
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:35,211
- You know I love doing favours.
- You hate doing favours.

79
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:40,141
I like doing 'em for you. Even though
I am in the best shape of my life,

80
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:42,233
and I am, by the way.

81
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:48,346
You could pretty much bounce
a quarter off my butt if you,

82
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:50,969
if you wanted to.

83
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:54,033
I don't have any change.

84
00:04:55,368 --> 00:04:59,919
Anyway, I'll probably need your help
getting your dresser up on the roof.

85
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:02,800
I'm sure you guys can handle it.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,150
I beg your pardon?

87
00:05:05,336 --> 00:05:08,169
This is a sweet ride.
You got seatbelts back here?

88
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:09,370
No.

89
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:24,010
You know that dresser
I got for Carla yesterday?

90
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:30,146
It's not for her place. It's for mine.
Is she moving in? No one asked me.

91
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:36,576
What the hell is this crap?

92
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:39,943
It's Dr Kelso!
Mr Sloane dropped the tape off.

93
00:05:40,162 --> 00:05:42,312
Why do you care so much?

94
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:46,457
It would be so interesting
if there was this whole romantic,

95
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:49,179
creative, vulnerable side to him.

96
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:53,779
I think it's a fascinating study
of human behaviour.

97
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,889
I think you're a fascinating study
of human behaviour.

98
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,255
The music's not that bad.

99
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:10,935
''My Tuscaloosa heart''?

100
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:14,747
You have to admit,
if that was him, it'd be pretty weird.

101
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:17,105
You're pretty weird.

102
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:21,196
- Stop doing that!
- You stop doing that!

103
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:27,756
<i>Mr Simon's room.</i>

104
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:29,879
You don't have to hide from him.

105
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:33,482
I'm not. I have a new exercise programme
called ''short bursts''.

106
00:06:33,716 --> 00:06:35,866
- Is it working?
- Do you have to ask?

107
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:38,168
- Yeah.
- Where'd Mr Simon go?

108
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:41,338
I'm guessing not Heaven.
He died.

109
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:43,832
- Number Two!
- Number One. What happened?

110
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:47,977
He had terminal cancer. He went
into respiratory arrest and passed away.

111
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,549
- Number Two!
- Number One.

112
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,127
- Did you give him naloxone?
- We tried intubating him and CPR.

113
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:56,075
Hey, Number Two!

114
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:58,673
- He went so fast.
- Say, ''Hey, Number One''.

115
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:02,461
- Hey, Number One.
- Hey, Number Two.

116
00:07:02,703 --> 00:07:06,093
<i>It's Kristen.</i>
<i>I missed you tonight.</i>

117
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:09,290
<i>I went ahead with the date on my own.</i>

118
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:12,494
<i>But it would've been</i>
<i>almost as fun if you were here.</i>

119
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:15,022
<i>I wish you were here. See ya.</i>

120
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:17,935
You are a stupid man.

121
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:21,795
Honey, I'm home.

122
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:25,522
You should lock your door.
There's horrible people out there.

123
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:28,885
There's horrible people right in here.

124
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:33,018
Maybe you forgot how this works.
When I say that ''Hi, honey'' thing,

125
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:36,666
you take your pants off.
Them's the rules of the booty call.

126
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:39,623
Jordan, believe me,
I enjoy our meaningless

127
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:43,214
post-divorce sex as much
as the next guy you marry will,

128
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:46,444
but your timing
could not be worse.

129
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:50,976
Maybe you don't remember
the terms of our settlement.

130
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:53,368
When Jordan needs sex,

131
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:55,662
Jordan gets sex.

132
00:07:57,383 --> 00:08:00,659
Listen, sweet cheeks,
I am seeing someone who...

133
00:08:00,886 --> 00:08:05,198
Let me guess! Dark hair, domineering,
doesn't take any of your crap?

134
00:08:05,474 --> 00:08:08,546
A lesser person would
mock your inability to move on.

135
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:12,079
I'm gonna consider it an homage.

136
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:14,624
There is something so

137
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:17,536
soft about you.

138
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:25,430
I'm seeing someone right now,
who, by the way, is great,

139
00:08:25,703 --> 00:08:30,299
and yet there's this other woman
who I cannot get out of my head.

140
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,256
She's totally unavailable,
which may be why

141
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:35,656
I can't get her out of my head.

142
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:38,671
And maybe,
and this is a whole new theory,

143
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:41,955
I keep thinking of this other woman,
the unavailable one,

144
00:08:42,178 --> 00:08:45,250
because I am so afraid that
the first thing might work.

145
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:49,591
And God forbid I ever do something
that might make me happy.

146
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:52,764
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

147
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,097
If I have to stay here
and listen to this crap,

148
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:58,308
I'll need a stronger drink.

149
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:02,581
- I hate you.
- I hate you too.

150
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:04,814
Fair enough.

151
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:09,303
I'm sure that was Dr Kelso singing.

152
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:14,207
It wasn't. Elliot, please. I don't
wanna have this conversation again.

153
00:09:14,502 --> 00:09:16,777
- I think it was him.
- It wasn't.

154
00:09:16,963 --> 00:09:18,954
- But what if it was?
- Good Lord.

155
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:21,565
Having a late-night tea party, are we?

156
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,557
I guess my invitation
must've been lost in the mail.

157
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:28,152
As long as I'm here,
I'm partial to Lemon Zinger.

158
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:31,781
Dr Turk is here cos his patient
is going into surgery tomorrow,

159
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,487
but I was hoping
we could do an ERCP first.

160
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:40,002
You're breakin' my Tuscaloosa heart.
Just turf him.

161
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:42,958
''Tuscaloosa heart''.

162
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:46,591
This is what I like to call
my ''Told You So'' dance.

163
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:00,423
- You guys awake?
- Holy son-of-a-cracker!

164
00:10:00,673 --> 00:10:04,188
Not now.
Maybe in the morning before work.

165
00:10:04,468 --> 00:10:07,619
Just thought I'd talk to you guys.

166
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:11,044
JD, when you were a kid,

167
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:15,624
did you used to walk into your parents'
room in the middle of the night?

168
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,966
Mommy, are you and Daddy
playing wheelbarrow?

169
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:24,265
Son, go back to bed.
I'm fixing Mommy's back.

170
00:10:24,488 --> 00:10:27,525
- Yes, once.
- Turk, you're not being sensitive.

171
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:31,337
I'll be sensitive at breakfast, baby.
Turk out.

172
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:35,538
- What's up, Bambi?
- I can't stop thinking about Mr Simon.

173
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,749
I neglected him
cos he was a jerk and I'm just

174
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:42,874
- worried that's what killed him.
- Could have been the neglect.

175
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:45,646
Could've been the terminal cancer.

176
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:47,879
You're a conscientious doctor.

177
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:52,172
You'd never do anything
to hurt a patient. You know that.

178
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:54,344
You're right.

179
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:58,090
Thank you, Carla.

180
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,352
- Peace out, Turk.
- Night.

181
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:05,366
<i>We all know what</i>
<i>goes on in the bedroom...</i>

182
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:07,562
- Baby, since we're up...
- No.

183
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,523
<i>...but it's also the place</i>
<i>to reflect on what's new in your life.</i>

184
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:16,586
Tell me about this girl you like.

185
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,589
<i>But most importantly,</i>
<i>it's where you can lie back,</i>

186
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:23,150
<i>let everything go</i>
<i>and finally just sleep.</i>

187
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,512
<i>Or not.</i>

188
00:11:31,305 --> 00:11:34,138
<i>So you got a good</i>
<i>nine minutes of sleep last night.</i>

189
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,662
<i>Remember it's a new day. Yesterday's</i>
<i>gone and it's never coming back.</i>

190
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:42,169
- Bambi, about yesterday...
- It's back?

191
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,949
They want you to present Mr Simon
at an M and M conference.

192
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:49,232
<i>Morbidity and Mortality conferences</i>
<i>are fun meetings</i>

193
00:11:49,448 --> 00:11:53,077
<i>when they think you might be</i>
<i>responsible for a patient's death.</i>

194
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:55,636
Bambi, don't be nervous.

195
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,505
Is it hot in here?
It's like, it's hot!

196
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:03,398
No, I'm fine.

197
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:08,559
<i>There's no reason to start</i>
<i>obsessing. You did nothing wrong.</i>

198
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:11,960
Morning, killer.

199
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:15,505
Have a good one, killer.

200
00:12:17,226 --> 00:12:19,057
- Hey, Number Two!
- Number One.

201
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:21,867
- Hey, Number Two!
- Stop doing that.

202
00:12:22,064 --> 00:12:24,658
- Look, Number One...
- Number Two.

203
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:29,535
We have the same name, but I can't
spend my day playing this game.

204
00:12:29,822 --> 00:12:31,813
I'm sorry.

205
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:37,152
Hey, Number Two?

206
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:40,947
- Hey, you.
- You got a minute?

207
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:45,038
You know what would make surgery
quicker? If we didn't have to be clean.

208
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:49,369
Listen, I gotta say something
to you here.

209
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:52,194
You are so great. You know?

210
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:55,617
You're se<i>xy</i>, you're smart,
God knows you're dangerous.

211
00:12:55,848 --> 00:12:58,078
- You think I'm a spy?
- No.

212
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:00,258
Look, I just want you to know

213
00:13:00,436 --> 00:13:03,587
that I haven't been
in this relationship 100% ,

214
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:08,649
and it's because of how great you are
and how much that scares me.

215
00:13:08,945 --> 00:13:12,221
But, from now on, if you want,

216
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:15,360
sister, you're gonna be
getting the whole shebang.

217
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:17,567
Cos I'm all in, baby.

218
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:21,655
Bring it. Ka-bow-bow.

219
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:24,392
Yeah, you come here
with the ka-bow-bow.

220
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:27,179
<i>My Bunny is a Baby Blue</i>

221
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,975
<i>Bunny, How Things Change,</i>
<i>B-U-N-N-Y Spells Love to Me?</i>

222
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:34,687
Ten songs about Bunny,
not one song about his wife.

223
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:38,319
It's impossible to write
a love song about anyone named Enid.

224
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:43,506
Don't you get it? This tape
shows exactly why Kelso is Kelso.

225
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:47,886
He used to be this beautiful,
wonderful, sweet, caring man.

226
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,620
He found the love of his life,
and she slips through his hands?

227
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:54,092
That is so sad.

228
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:59,834
Have you guys ever stopped to think
that maybe Bunny is just a real bunny?

229
00:14:00,162 --> 00:14:02,630
That's just stupid.

230
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:05,865
Yeah, I know.

231
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:09,722
<i>I'm OK.</i>

232
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:12,834
<i>I'm OK. I'm a ''K''.</i>

233
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,644
<i>I'm a '''K''?</i>
<i>What the hell does that mean?</i>

234
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:20,521
Dr Dorian, we have examined
Aaron Simon's file.

235
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:25,086
Before we begin,
do you have any last words?

236
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:30,841
I'm a ''K''.

237
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:33,818
That was terrible.
Can I have a do-over?

238
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:38,892
Initially there were concerns that
Mr Simon may have been overmedicated.

239
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,072
We have concluded
that his pain control

240
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:45,439
was both adequate
and well within normal limits.

241
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,702
Thank you for stopping by.

242
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:50,869
Sir, I am not sure
how this thing usually works,

243
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:54,239
but I was kinda hoping
we could take a closer look at me.

244
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:57,743
I've been sort of
doubting my performance,

245
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,928
and it would be really helpful
if we could just all

246
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,655
talk about it as a group.

247
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:11,139
<i>Dr Kelso isn't looking</i>
<i>to do me any favours.</i>

248
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,873
<i>If I did something wrong,</i>
<i>he'd call me on it.</i>

249
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:18,381
<i>Then how come I still can't sleep?</i>

250
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:23,010
- My God.
- I know. I didn't do it.

251
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:24,956
Joy.

252
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:29,320
I told you when he saw us together he'd
fold his arms and do the teeth thing.

253
00:15:29,585 --> 00:15:32,145
He did the same
the first time I saw him naked.

254
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:34,135
No way, same here.

255
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:37,574
This is beyond horrible.

256
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:39,793
Relax. I came by for a board meeting

257
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:42,531
and to meet the new lady
in your life and warn her.

258
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:44,759
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

259
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:46,652
Kristen,

260
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:49,484
this is my emotional baggage.

261
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:51,998
Baggage, Kristen.

262
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:54,022
Be nice.

263
00:15:54,193 --> 00:15:57,708
I wanted to thank you for helping
with that dresser last night.

264
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:01,656
- Sure, no problem.
- He's a great guy.

265
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:08,029
- That's why you blew me off?
- I should leave.

266
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:12,728
Moving furniture with that nurse
you have a crush on? That's your 100% ?

267
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:16,280
No! The 100% came well after that.

268
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:19,658
Her boyfriend was there the entire time.

269
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:24,401
And bailing on you is far and away
the best thing that could have happened,

270
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:28,436
because it made me realise
that I was sabotaging myself again.

271
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:31,564
If you don't believe me, ask Jordan.

272
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:37,051
Would you please tell her what I said to
you right before you left this morning?

273
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:39,352
Left where?

274
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:47,360
You're unbelievable.

275
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:51,581
That's too bad. I liked her.

276
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,746
I did too.

277
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:56,912
Dear God.

278
00:16:57,882 --> 00:17:00,635
Why don't we just say something to him?

279
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:02,515
- Like what?
- I don't know.

280
00:17:02,678 --> 00:17:05,636
''I heard your songs
and they're extraordinary''?

281
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:07,361
Elliot, don't.

282
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:09,507
- I won't.
- Pinkie swear.

283
00:17:10,937 --> 00:17:14,088
I heard your songs
and they're extraordinary!

284
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:15,828
Excuse me?

285
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:18,099
You swore!

286
00:17:18,277 --> 00:17:20,871
You know what? Just forget it.

287
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:22,869
We won't bother you any more.

288
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:28,685
Sir, whatever happened to Bunny?
We gotta know.

289
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:32,106
Actually, the music came before Bunny.

290
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:36,884
I learned to play the guitar growing up
as a young rapscallion in Mississippi.

291
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:40,049
But things didn't take off
until I moved to Memphis.

292
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:43,216
Then I met the Colonel,
and the hits just kept coming.

293
00:17:43,427 --> 00:17:48,217
But it went to my head. I gained a lot
of weight, started wearing jumpsuits

294
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:51,952
and ate tranquillisers
like they were trail mix.

295
00:17:52,186 --> 00:17:55,735
Then, in 1977, I died on the toilet.

296
00:17:55,982 --> 00:17:57,859
Or did I?

297
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:01,779
- You never played the guitar?
- That crap is for hippies!

298
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:05,465
Now, for God's sake, get back to work.

299
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,498
Thank you very much.

300
00:18:08,703 --> 00:18:11,900
<i>I always turn</i>
<i>to the person I trust the most.</i>

301
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:16,480
<i>Cos I know when he says I didn't</i>
<i>do anything wrong, I'll believe it.</i>

302
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:19,425
Looks like you screwed
the pooch there.

303
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,064
- I didn't overmedicate him.
- You didn't.

304
00:18:22,258 --> 00:18:24,249
I always check your orders.

305
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:28,579
But if you're wondering whether
or not you treated Mr Simon differently

306
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:30,998
because he's a complete jerk, well,

307
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:33,902
I think you know the answer
to that one.

308
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:38,218
- Depends what you mean by ''different''.
- I have to warn you, I just got dumped

309
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:43,237
in front of my ex-wife,
not ten minutes ago.

310
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:49,559
It's always easy to treat
the nice ones nice, isn't it?

311
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:52,660
But your drug addicts,
your child abusers,

312
00:18:52,872 --> 00:18:55,340
your garden-variety jerks...

313
00:18:57,877 --> 00:19:01,631
You know, it's barely misting out.

314
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:04,076
It's my hair. If it even gets damp,

315
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:07,648
it frizzes out and becomes
wildly unmanageable.

316
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:12,438
- Mine too.
- It was a joke, ya girl.

317
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:17,241
Newbie, the only way
to judge your growth as a doctor,

318
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:19,512
hell, as a human being,

319
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,729
is by making sure you don't repeat
the same mistakes over and over.

320
00:19:28,282 --> 00:19:32,673
That was really great, but next time,
would you not look me in the eye?

321
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:35,468
It gets in the way
of what I come here to do.

322
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:38,737
Then stop turnin' around.

323
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,076
- That's classy.
- Wait a minute.

324
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:45,964
You don't have to go,
you know, if you don't want to.

325
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:50,298
- Are you really that lonely?
- Kinda, yeah.

326
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:55,601
All right. I'll toss you
a quickie, but no talking.

327
00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:00,603
- I'll talk if I want to.
- Be quiet.

328
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:04,007
<i>The worst thing about being a doctor</i>
<i>is you fall short a lot.</i>

329
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:07,113
<i>The best part is that,</i>
<i>if you wait for a few seconds,</i>

330
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:09,152

335
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:24,263

<i>And once you've accepted</i>
<i>all sides of yourself,</i>

346
