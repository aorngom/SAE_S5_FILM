1
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:05,831
<i>Here's the deal:</i>
<i>Turk and Elliot wrote a paper</i>

2
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:07,765
<i>on peripheral vascular disease.</i>

3
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:10,882
<i>They're upset because they</i>
<i>have to present it at a conference.</i>

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,131
Do you know how many interns
would die to do that?

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,896
Not me, I don't care. I know my paper
was a trillion times better.

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:22,375
It's so political. Surprise! They went
with the black guy and the girl.

7
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,717
- Bambi.
- What?

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,413
What right do they have to be mopey?

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,761
<i>That's when Elliot said</i>
<i>something that explained everything.</i>

10
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,945
Our parents are coming.

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,046
Oh, I am so sorry.

12
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,237
<i>I could tell my friends were upset.</i>

13
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,006
- <i>Still, there was a bright side.</i>
- It's all right.

14
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,117
<i>I knew I could make it worse.</i>

15
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,964
- Missed a spot!
- You could help!

16
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,960
- You can't even hear the TV!
- I like the pictures.

17
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,400
<i>If I believed in karma,</i>

18
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,460
<i>I'd be more cautious</i>
<i>about giving these guys a hard time.</i>

19
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,395
Hey, Dad.
No, no, nothing.

20
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,986
Turk and Elliot are freaking out
because their parents are coming.

21
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,657
<i>But karma doesn't scare me.</i>

22
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,846
No. It hasn't been that long
since you and I saw each other.

23
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,216
- Dad?
- Hey, Mr Dorian.

24
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,995
Hey, boys, what's shakin'?

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,981
- Who needs a beer?
- Who doesn't?

26
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,723
You see, JD,
this is what goes around.

27
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,897
But this?
This is what comes around.

28
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,031
- Get out of here.
- Only two left.

29
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,399
- That's all right. JD'll go out.
- Oh, get some chips.

30
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,308
Wowser, Rowdy's a boy dog.

31
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,943
<i>My mom and dad</i>
<i>got divorced when I was seven.</i>

32
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:46,136
<i>That's not unusual, but though</i>
<i>everybody's relationship</i>

33
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,474
<i>with their father is different, mine has</i>
<i>always seemed very different.</i>

34
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:54,011
God, I'd like to take a run at her.
Look at that rack.

35
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,356
- Dad, please.
- I'm sorry, Johnny. I'm just a man.

36
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,373
- You know what they say about men.
- They love boobies.

37
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,296
That's is correct, Christopher.

38
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,764
OK, you know, I think
I'm gonna hit the sack

39
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,914
before I get
even more uncomfortable.

40
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,996
Your mother had a beautiful bosom.

41
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,286
- There it is.
- Would you stay?

42
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,614
We've got a lot of catching up
to do. Please.

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,756
OK.

44
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,547
You guys have a policy on farting?

45
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:19,950
No, let 'er rip.

46
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,245
Fire in the hole.

47
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,788
Oh, my God, Dad.

48
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,450
Count it!

49
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,558
That was a nice moment.

50
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,510
<i>I guess everyone's parents</i>
<i>drive them crazy.</i>

51
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,654
So this is my hospital.

52
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,096
It's stunning.

53
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,433
Honey, is there a rule against
looking pretty here?

54
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,939
Nothing official.

55
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,913
I just think you would look
so much more handsome in blue scrubs.

56
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,160
Thank you, Mommy,

57
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,936
but I like my green scrubs better.

58
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,523
<i>Parents have a way of making</i>
<i>their children regress.</i>

59
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,356
I don't want to wear blue scrubs!

60
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,468
Come on. Boy, you better
watch your manners.

61
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,356
Come on, now.

62
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,353
You can't have one, sweetheart.
Perms are for trailer trash.

63
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,679
What in the hell is this,
parents' weekend?

64
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,018
Sort of.
Elliot and Turk wrote this paper,

65
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,505
then my dad decided
''I wanna come too,'' so...

66
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,166
Look, Reba, if I ask you a question

67
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,166
that doesn't specifically deal
with a medical issue,

68
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,488
you can bet your powdered bottom
I don't want you to answer.

69
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,379
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

70
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,102
It's like working with a monkey.

71
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,088
- What?
- Nothing.

72
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,568
Why didn't you introduce me
to your mother?

73
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,311
Because she just came by to say ''hey''
before she checked into her hotel.

74
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,673
She's coming back
later to look around.

75
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,490
OK. I was worried you thought
she might not like me.

76
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,680
She's not gonna like you.
Baby, look.

77
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,209
My mother's never called any girl
I've been with by her name.

78
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,719
She called my college
girlfriend The Big Easy.

79
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,294
Well, was she fat and slutty?

80
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,163
She had beautiful skin.

81
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,282
Don't smile, woman. She did.

82
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,250
Just beautiful.

83
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,769
So, what do you guys think?

84
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,836
I think it's time to get back
to the suite and get in a bath.

85
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,558
This place makes me feel dirty.

86
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,543
Dr Kelso? Dr Kelso,
these are my parents.

87
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,359
Ah, well!

88
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,106
It's a pleasure to meet the trees
from which our little acorns fall.

89
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,179
- Bob Kelso.
- Simon Reid.

90
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,545
I'm chief of medicine
at St Augustine's.

91
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,367
It's a private hospital in Greenwich.

92
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,203
I know what you're thinking.
You didn't ask.

93
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,550
Nobody ever does.

94
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,431
So, how long
are you guys staying?

95
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,801
Can I help you, sir?

96
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,872
- Sir?
- You can help me

97
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,394
by minding your own damn business.

98
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,616
Excuse me?

99
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,830
Oh, aggressive, huh?

100
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,202
Do you really want to
get it on with me, pipsqueak?

101
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,700
Because if you do, I guarantee

102
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,845
it'll be the last stupid thing
you ever do on God's green earth.

103
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,540
Nice meeting you.

104
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,959
<i>What the hell was that all about?</i>

105
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,695
Dad. Don't wander off like that.

106
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,161
This is your basic
arthrocentesis there.

107
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,241
Your resident should've
shown you how to do this.

108
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,802
<i>He can't be that mad.</i>

109
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,464
<i>Even though residents</i>
<i>are supposed to teach you,</i>

110
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,811
<i>they only show up</i>
<i>when they want something.</i>

111
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,591
I have to give the students
a lecture on heart murmurs.

112
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,464
- Could you do it?
- Actually...

113
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:36,946
Thanks, man.

114
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:42,881
That sucks. I totally wanted to spend
some time with my dad tomorrow.

115
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,965
Then take him.

116
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,127
- What do you mean?
- I don't know?

117
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,024
Secure some kind of vehicle,
car, balloon, tricycle,

118
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:53,581
and transport your father from where
he is to where you're going.

119
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,484
I don't think you get my dad.

120
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,207
He's not interested in my work.
He's more of like a buddy.

121
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,278
OK. That was my mistake.

122
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,956
Here, I engaged you and gave you
the impression that I actually care,

123
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,190
which is just so wrong! God!

124
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,560
The thing is,
I don't need a buddy.

125
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,383
What I need is a father.

126
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,416
You definitely need something.

127
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,733
Maybe a backbone.
Or perhaps some testicles.

128
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,397
At the very least, a pillow that
you could carry around the hospital

129
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:26,022
and just cry your sad eyes out
into whenever trauma...

130
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,691
I have testicles.

131
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,560
He's a kidder.

132
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,503
All right, this is it.

133
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,521
Brace yourself and let me handle
this nice and smooth.

134
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,198
All right?
Hey, Mom, guess what.

135
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,833
Hi, Mrs Turk,
I'm gonna cut to the chase.

136
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,064
I'm Carla. I apologise if your
son hasn't told you about me.

137
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,113
I don't know how you've
put up with him as long as you did.

138
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,554
Still, you should know
he loves me very much,

139
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,338
I feel the same
and we're really good together.

140
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,688
- Are you two sharing a bed?
- No!

141
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,307
Yes, ma'am, we are.

142
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:01,577
But if you're a good judge of character,
you can tell I'm not messing around.

143
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,989
- Carla. It's a nice name.
- Thank you.

144
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,447
- Yes, it is, Mother.
- Oh, please. Not telling me about her.

145
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,476
Dear, do me a favour.
Don't give him any for a month or so.

146
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,070
- Done.
- It can't go down like that.

147
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,417
It just can't go down like that.

148
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,651
After you, sir.

149
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,008
Well, I'll be.

150
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,743
I haven't seen a ward
like this since Vietnam.

151
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,174
So where in Connecticut
was your National Guard unit stationed?

152
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,316
- Amusing.
- I thought so.

153
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,563
I think they're totally
getting along, don't you?

154
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,979
I'm about to open
a fat can of whup-ass on you.

155
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,482
Bring it on, bitch.

156
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:44,684
All right, sports fans,
we have a guest today at rounds,

157
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,194
so let's try and be sharp.

158
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,340
Why don't we begin with,

159
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,661
I don't know, Dr Reid.

160
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:55,395
What is the nutritional cause
of high output cardiac failure?

161
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,758
Wet beriberi
from thiamine deficiency.

162
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,734
Yes, it is. Next question.

163
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,770
Why don't we try...

164
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,960
...Dr Reid.

165
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,182
I already went, sir.

166
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:13,118
- Oh, are you done for the day?
- No.

167
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:17,281
What's the mechanism of Cheyne-Stokes
respiration in systolic dysfunction?

168
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,131
<i>What? Nobody knows that.</i>

169
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,599
Prolongation of circulation time
from lung to brain

170
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,307
causing diminished sensitivity
of the respiratory centre

171
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,495
to arterial partial pressure
of carbon dioxide?

172
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,584
Yes.

173
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,005
My dad winked at me!

174
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,777
If that's not saying,
''I love you, I'm proud of you,''

175
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,536
- I'm not sure what is.
- I know!

176
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,885
There are no gratuitous winks
in the Reid household.

177
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,383
<i>And that's when I decided</i>
<i>to take a chance.</i>

178
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:52,085
I'd love to come to your heart murmur
lecture. I'm a big fan of those things.

179
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,878
That means a lot, Dad.

180
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,945
<i>Absolutely. Please.</i>

181
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,394
Oh, dear Lord,
please make it stop.

182
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,454
- It's stunning.
- Thank you.

183
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,900
- And I understand that you...
- I make these.

184
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,522
Like two wolves gabbing about
which sheep to eat.

185
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:12,591
Unfortunately for them, I'm a man.

186
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,517
- Turk.
- Coming.

187
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,678
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

188
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,601
Hi, Mrs Turk.

189
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,998
John Dorian, get over here.

190
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,070
After all these years,
are you still afraid of me?

191
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:31,427
On Thanksgiving, I said your turkey was
dry, and you picked me up and shook me.

192
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,766
- Then don't say that.
- Silly Bambi.

193
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,267
You guys, leave him alone.

194
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,844
I've had enough of you two
conspiring and whatnot. It ends now!

195
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,991
It is so cute when he
thinks he's in charge.

196
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,199
- I know. It kills me.
- <i>And that's when it happened.</i>

197
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,933
You should see him when I pretend
to let him...make a decision!

198
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:56,229
<i>That's when Carla realised</i>
<i>she was exactly like Turk's mom.</i>

199
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,218
Great job at rounds today, Dr Reid.

200
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,308
- Thank you, sir.
- Your dad must've been very impressed.

201
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,957
Yeah, I think so.

202
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,384
I could tell that
he respected you, sir.

203
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,799
Well, that's very nice,
but lucky for me,

204
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,060
my self-esteem isn't tied up
in that kind of poppycock.

205
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,320
I didn't become a doctor
to impress my daddy or anyone else.

206
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,209
I did it for me.

207
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,409
I've seen lots of doctors
get into this for the wrong reason.

208
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,093
- You know what happens to them?
- No.

209
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,933
They quit and get
their real estate licence.

210
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,248
You look upset, sweetheart.

211
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,859
You shouldn't be.

212
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,479
I think you'd look super
in a gold blazer.

213
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,636
Thank you?

214
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,709
This is almost too easy.

215
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,144
Well, work is great, Johnny.

216
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,954
I like to believe
that I'm selling dreams.

217
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:56,543
- But, Dad, you sell office supplies.
- Yeah, I prefer to call them dreams.

218
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,020
I'm gonna steal another Jell-O.

219
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,235
<i>I always thought parents</i>
<i>were like tornadoes.</i>

220
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:07,289
<i>They blow into town</i>
<i>and devastate everything in their path.</i>

221
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,931
- Hi.
- There's no food on your tray.

222
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,156
Oh.

223
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,253
<i>But it's different for me.</i>

224
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,212
How you doing, Elliot?

225
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,849
Great talk. Anyway, Johnny,

226
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,777
I was talking to my buddy, Jake,
this afternoon.

227
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,730
- You remember Jake?
- No.

228
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,532
Jake's my buddy,
and he's leaving the country

229
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,928
for who knows how long.
So I thought I might

230
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,749
get out of here tomorrow
and go catch up with him.

231
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,345
I'd miss your thing,

232
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,879
but I wouldn't know
what I was hearing anyway.

233
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,953
- Right?
- Right.

234
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,030
<i>I think what surprised me the most</i>

235
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,480
<i>is that I was actually surprised.</i>

236
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,418
You still talking to yourself?

237
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,495
I thought you'd outgrow that by now.

238
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,398
<i>I probably should've</i>
<i>woken him up to say goodbye</i>

239
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,950
<i>considering he'd be gone</i>
<i>before I got home.</i>

240
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,937
<i>I told myself I wanted to let</i>
<i>the old guy get some sleep,</i>

241
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,020
<i>but even I didn't believe that.</i>

242
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,799
You keep eating that,

243
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,503
there'll be nothing left
for a man to put a ring on.

244
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,607
Mom...

245
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,658
...I started therapy.

246
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,544
Do you know that Amy Swanson's
marrying Drew Gertson?

247
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,700
Drew is such a nice boy.

248
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,431
Drew used to hold people down
and spit in their mouths.

249
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,137
He doesn't do that anymore.

250
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,170
Mom, when I was a little girl,
did I want to be a doctor?

251
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,052
Maybe I used a toy stethoscope
on one of my dolls?

252
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,567
Oh, honey,
you'd have to ask the nanny.

253
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,997
Have you ever reached
a point in your life

254
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,739
when you really wished
you knew how you got there?

255
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,082
Are you trying to tell me
you're a lesbian?

256
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,906
Yes, I am.

257
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,733
Yep.

258
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,490
That's exactly...
exactly what I'm saying, Mom.

259
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,249
Yo, JD. You want to grab
a bite to eat with us tonight

260
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,403
after we do our presentation?

261
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,053
Yeah, I'm not that busy.

262
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,510
If you're not busy, you have time
to do this discharge summary.

263
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,499
- I meant that later I'm not that busy.
- Fantastic.

264
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:14,256
I told my mom you like that Cuban
restaurant. She loves Cuban food...

265
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,299
I hate that restaurant.

266
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,376
You said you loved it and wanted
to be buried in a vat of <i>plátanos</i>

267
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,066
so you could eat your way out.

268
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,130
See? That's our problem.
You don't get me.

269
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,746
No argument there.

270
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,940
Hey, hey, hey!
You missed a spot, right there.

271
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,817
Well, lucky for me, Dad,

272
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,859
I spend my life going in a circle around
this place cleaning up after the sick.

273
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,498
Tomorrow I'll probably
be here at the same time.

274
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:44,529
You know that I hate sass, so
drop right down and give me 20.

275
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:47,422
- That could be faecal matter.
- Make it 30.

276
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,689
Fine.

277
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,384
<i>What is it with parents?</i>

278
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,099
<i>Why is it so easy for them</i>
<i>to make us feel bad?</i>

279
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,125
- ...three...
- Sound off like you've got a pair!

280
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,168
Dad, I don't gotta put up with...

281
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,773
You've got to at least try
and pace yourself.

282
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,605
Otherwise, sure as shooting,
you're gonna burn out.

283
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,998
Come.

284
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,009
I heard the sad sigh,
I see your shoulders are slumped,

285
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,501
and I'm aware that
you have some problem

286
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,166
you want to talk to me about.

287
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,544
You probably think it'll be
cathartic to get it off your chest,

288
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,686
but believe me, it won't be.

289
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,533
What you've got to do,
for me, is the healthy thing.

290
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:27,970
Keep all of your feelings bottled up
inside where they so belong.

291
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,803
My dad flaked on me again.

292
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,954
I'm sorry. You're not
on drugs, are you?

293
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,484
What? No.

294
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,617
Are you in jail? Have you been beaten?
Are you malnourished?

295
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,146
I skipped lunch,
but I've been snacking.

296
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,376
You are, in fact, a perfectly
healthy 26-year-old doctor

297
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,789
who keeps crying about
how horrible his father was.

298
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,971
Well, he did some considerable
emotional damage, so...

299
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,652
Every one of our parents does
considerable emotional damage,

300
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,725
and from what I've heard,

301
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,093
it just might be the best part
of being a parent.

302
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,591
If some guy ever does put
a ring on your finger,

303
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:06,611
and you're lucky enough to pop out a
youngster, I'm sure you'll understand.

304
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:10,255
But for now, trust me when
I tell you that I wouldn't care

305
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,644
if today was the first time
you ever even met your daddy.

306
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,864
Because in reality,

307
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,802
well, he could've done
a much, much worse job.

308
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,516
OK.

309
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,774
All right, look, at the presentation,

310
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,721
could I do the ending?
I really love the end of our paper.

311
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,201
Do you think that I'm
cut out to be a doctor?

312
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,460
OK, fine.
You can do the ending.

313
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,202
I just want to say,
''Thanks, folks. We've been great.''

314
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,831
I'm serious. Do you think this
is what I really want to do?

315
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,977
Elliot, I don't know.

316
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,107
You can tell me. I can take it.

317
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,588
No, I'm saying ''I don't know''
because I really don't know.

318
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:52,020
What the hell is going on here?

319
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,154
Why have all women gone crazy?

320
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,075
I'm not crazy. Am I?

321
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,285
No. Shh.

322
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,009
It's OK, Elliot.
You're normal. You're normal.

323
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:07,133
- Turk?
- He's not here.

324
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,775
Turk.

325
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,400
I do like that Cuban restaurant.

326
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,112
I think the important thing
is that we got through this together.

327
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:19,388
I'm freaked out because your mom
and I have lots in common.

328
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,038
- So?
- I don't know.

329
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,541
I got this crazy idea
that you only fell for me

330
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,567
because I'm just like your mom.

331
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,132
Baby...

332
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,115
That's exactly why I fell for you.

333
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,000
OK. I'll probably have
a friend pick up my stuff.

334
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,673
Wait. Sit down.

335
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,944
What's wrong with wanting someone

336
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:45,756
because they're smart, independent
and always looking out for you?

337
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,611
OK?

338
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,311
Yeah. But if we ever get married, we'll
have to talk about this in therapy.

339
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,632
Relax. I don't do this with my mama.

340
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,897
I hope not.

341
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,682
- Oh, yeah, Mama.
- Oh, that's just wrong.

342
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,857
Oh, Mama.

343
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,152
<i>Part of me</i>
<i>thought Cox was wrong.</i>

344
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,393
<i>I had every reason</i>
<i>to be angry with my father.</i>

345
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,885
So, how's it going down there?

346
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,956
If it's OK with you,
we just won't talk right now.

347
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,804
Got a needle. Need to focus.

348
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,196
<i>Then I stopped</i>
<i>thinking of my dad as a father</i>

349
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,687
<i>and started thinking of him as a man.</i>

350
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:31,920
<i>And I realised some things that</i>
<i>deep down I probably always knew.</i>

351
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:36,011
<i>Like, maybe he wasn't crashing on my</i>
<i>couch to spend more quality time with me</i>

352
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,858
<i>but because he couldn't</i>
<i>afford a hotel room.</i>

353
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,051
<i>And maybe he wasn't going</i>
<i>to see his buddy Jake to catch up,</i>

354
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,865
<i>but because Jake was someone</i>
<i>he might be able to sell something to,</i>

355
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,337
<i>and he really needs a sale.</i>

356
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,324
<i>Maybe the truth is he's</i>
<i>just a middle-aged, lonely guy</i>

357
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,884
<i>struggling to get by,</i>
<i>and it sure would be nice</i>

358
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,383
<i>if someone gave him</i>
<i>a break once in a while.</i>

359
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,804
Hey, Dad.

360
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,022
Hey, there he is.

361
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,355
I thought you had to work all day.

362
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,735
I did, but I got someone
to cover for me.

363
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,637
I wanted to make sure
I caught you and let you know

364
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,509
how cool it was to see you.

365
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,062
- Really?
- Yeah.

366
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,249
Wow, I...

367
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,817
Well, listen, I'm, you know,

368
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,164
I have to travel a lot lately, so...

369
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,059
...l'm sure I'll be back
in this region again soon.

370
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:28,100
So I could swing back out
and see you.

371
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,792
- That'd be great.
- Great.

372
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,375
- Great.
- Great. I'd be happy to see you.

373
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,888
Yeah, we could do that.

374
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,705
You've been taking advantage
of the farting policy.

375
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,980
Hey. Pull my finger.

376
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:44,154
- I'm not gonna pull your finger.
- See what happens.

377
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,995
I pooed a little.

378
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,939
Dr Kelso.

379
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,999
Well, if it isn't Daddy's little girl.

380
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,164
I wanted to tell you
what happened to me.

381
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,492
I'm going to keep eating my soup,

382
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,590
but you rest assured
I'm holding my breath on the inside.

383
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,274
First, I came out to my mother.

384
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,510
Well, then,

385
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:07,522
it appears the boys in radiology
owe me quite a bit of money.

386
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,364
But this afternoon...

387
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:12,243
<i>...a patient puked on me.</i>

388
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:15,004
<i>And I smiled.</i>

389
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,993
Do you know why I was smiling?

390
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,954
Because I really like what I do.

391
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,711
You were right. I got into this
for the wrong reasons.

392
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,869
But now that I'm here, I can't
imagine being anywhere else.

393
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,641
I still don't like your father.

394
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,870
Oh, me neither, sir.

395
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:33,196
Oh. They were all out.

396
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,892
Placement of the stent in haemodynamic
results of PTA are inadequate.

397
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,971
Or primary stent placement
at the initial time of PTA...

398
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,573
<i>Maybe the mistake we make</i>
<i>is thinking our parents will change.</i>

399
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,564
<i>And maybe they did a betterjob</i>
<i>than we give them credit for.</i>

400
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:52,241
<i>Maybe there,</i>
<i>amid all the crap they dumped on us,</i>

401
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,000
<i>are some things worth keeping.</i>

402
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,712
<i>Like a passion for something</i>
<i>you never knew you had.</i>

403
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,816
...recent trial of 283 patients...

404
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,187
<i>Or the ability to surround</i>
<i>yourself with people who love you.</i>

405
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,323
...subsequent stent placement
only increases... In conclusion,

406
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,970
the difference between the strategies

407
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:13,285
is not significant at either
short-term or long-term follow-up.

408
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,219
Thank you very much, folks,
we've been great.

409
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,534
And ''Z'' is for the Zs
that you'll be getting

410
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,882
cos you now know
heart murmurs from A to Z.

411
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,624
Thank you.

412
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:44,331
- What are you doing here?
- I just figured I'd come, check it out.

413
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,966
You know, see how you're doing.

414
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,119
And for the record,
that was atrocious.

415
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,769
I mean, downright abysmal.

416
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,748
I know, but did you
see A through K?

417
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,750
I did a cool thing with A through K.

418
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,799
I showed up at Y,
as in ''Why, dear God? Why?''

419
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,344
You know, this has got to be

420
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,025
the most piss-poor,
sorry excuse for a hospital

421
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,338
that I have ever set foot in.

422
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:10,509
Well, Dad, in that case, feel free
not to stop by every day you're in town.

423
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,726
Goodbye, Son.

424
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,219
I'll see you tomorrow.

425
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,834
Yeah.

426
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,656
Parents, huh?

427
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,336
Tell me about it.

428
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,800
Yeah. What's that,
a shot at my dad?

429
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,825
That's stepping
over the line, pal.

430
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,226
I missed this.

431
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,016
Yeah.

432
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
