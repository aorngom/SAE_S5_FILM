00:00:01,814 --> 00:00:05,363
<i>During your first year,</i>
<i>things begin to feel different.</i>

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,602
<i>You've arrived. You know?</i>
<i>You just start to feel...</i>

3
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:10,174
I'm open.

4
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:13,329
- <i>...cooler.</i>
- My God!

5
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:17,280
- Turk, that was amazing!
- Woman, shush.

6
00:00:17,538 --> 00:00:21,133
It's a lot cooler
if we don't make a big deal out of it.

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,320
Hang on, Ma. It's him.

8
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:36,391
- <i>Whatever.</i>
- JD!

9
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:39,025
<i>The point is,</i>
<i>we've found our stride.</i>

10
00:00:39,226 --> 00:00:41,137
<i>We know all the ins and outs.</i>

11
00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:44,998
Shall we? And...

12
00:00:53,532 --> 00:00:56,126
My God!
Which one of you two did that?

13
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:57,806
- My bad.
- That was me.

14
00:00:57,954 --> 00:01:00,832
- Both of you?
- Player!

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,589
Could we have an agreement?
No enclosed spaces.

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,560
- Morning, doctors.
- Morning, sir.

17
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,394
Mrs Winston,
it's back to the home for you.

18
00:01:15,846 --> 00:01:18,235
- Elliot, that is disgusting.
- Seriously.

19
00:01:19,642 --> 00:01:22,759
Sweetheart, consider a change in diet.

20
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:27,984
Fine. I hate you guys.
I hate you, I hate you.

21
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:31,787
<i>Let's face it. We've earned</i>
<i>the right to be a little cocky.</i>

22
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:35,677
- Jerome!
- What up, dawg?

23
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:37,822
My man!

24
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:39,825
Who the hell's Jerome?

25
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:43,113
<i>And I gotta tell you,</i>
<i>nobody can take this feeling away.</i>

26
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,163
<i>Nobody.</i>

27
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:48,683
Thank goodness,
it's the Mod Squad.

28
00:01:50,756 --> 00:01:53,668
<i>After months of doing</i>
<i>everyone else's scut work,</i>

29
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:57,035
<i>we're finally not the lowest</i>
<i>people on the totem pole.</i>

30
00:01:57,263 --> 00:01:59,936
Look at you three, all excited.

31
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:05,715
<i>Today we get</i>
<i>our very own med students.</i>

32
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:11,455
Welcome to Hell.

33
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:15,501
Gimme some hungry chicken.

34
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:18,982
Not hungry enough.
Give me some more.

35
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,230
There you go.

36
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:42,334
Look how scared they are.

37
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:45,553
It's like we're cheetahs
and they're a pack of gazelles.

38
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:57,225
I'm Dr Bob Kelso,
and I'm your Chief of Medicine.

39
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,768
I want to encourage you all
to think of me as your safety net.

40
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:05,745
Because I promise you,
we're a family here.

41
00:03:05,998 --> 00:03:08,353
Let's go get 'em, doctors.

42
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:11,814
They're buying it.

43
00:03:11,963 --> 00:03:15,353
''The Devil's greatest trick was
convincing the world he didn't exist.''

44
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:16,546
<i>Baby</i>

45
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:18,155
<i>Girl</i>

46
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:21,339
- You two are dorks.
- I gotta go.

47
00:03:21,555 --> 00:03:24,513
I gotta go meet up with
my med student up in Surgery.

48
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:26,044
Know who you're getting?

49
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:29,177
Nope, but it's probably someone black.

50
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:31,865
- <i>Sugar darlin'</i>
- <i>Girl</i>

51
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:35,418
So, I want someone
I can be friends with, you know?

52
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:39,646
I hope I get a jerk. I took
so much crap as a med student

53
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:43,422
that I've been waiting for the day
I get to make someone suffer.

54
00:03:44,537 --> 00:03:46,095
Listen, nurse.

55
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:48,158
I'm looking for a Dr Elliot Reid.

56
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:50,163
I'm Elliot Reid.

57
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:53,883
Guy's name,
guy's job, guy's clothes...

58
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,325
Anything else you wanna tell me?

59
00:03:56,507 --> 00:03:59,544
Goody! You're a jerk.

60
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:06,336
Just remember to breathe,
and you'll get through the day.

61
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:09,638
Josh?
Hi, I'm Dr Dorian.

62
00:04:10,855 --> 00:04:12,846
I know what this looks like, but...

63
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:15,219
I do that all the time.

64
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:18,074
Do you ever part
your hair on the wrong side

65
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,351
to see what you look like
to other people?

66
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:22,768
No.

67
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:25,376
It totally messes everyone up.

68
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:28,395
Do you have any questions?

69
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:30,697
What's the babe
situation like here?

70
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,911
Easy, tiger.

71
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:40,255
Have you seen a med student here?

72
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:42,735
Yeah. Me.

73
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:46,000
Cool. Nice to meet you, ma'am.

74
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:49,613
Actually, the only people
that call me ''ma'am'' are nobody.

75
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:52,446
No. I use ''ma'am'' all the time. Watch.

76
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:55,241
What up, ma'am?

77
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:58,990
- See? It's my thing.
- Yeah, right.

78
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:00,908
Come on. I'm here to learn.

79
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:03,028
Listen up, kid.
Lesson number one:

80
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,269
All surgical interns?
They're dogs.

81
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:07,248
- Not a problem.
- Hey, baby.

82
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:12,280
This overbearing machismo is usually
just compensation for a lap-pinkie.

83
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,858
That's cold!

84
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:18,453
What just happened?

85
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:21,907
Don't worry about it.
It's all good in the 'hood.

86
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:27,587
I'll tell you what I expect.
You parted your hair on the other side?

87
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:31,880
You're gonna do H & Ps,
write admission orders...

88
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:33,582
What are you doing?

89
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:36,118
I can't walk and write at the same time.

90
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:39,227
- It makes me nauseous.
- <i>A famous doctor once said,</i>

91
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:43,231
<i>''Show me a med student that only</i>
<i>triples my work and I'll kiss his feet. ''</i>

92
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:47,960
Philip, I need you to shave his groin
so I can place a femoral triple-lumen.

93
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:51,953
I'm not so much with
the ''shavin' a guy's curlies''.

94
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:55,198
If you get just one
bad evaluation from me,

95
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:58,251
it'll torch your class rank,
so do what I tell you.

96
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:00,418
And if I ask you to shave a groin,

97
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:03,626
thank your lucky stars
that I said ''shave''.

98
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:10,156
I'll tell you what.

99
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:13,141
I'll lather you up,
and you think about baseball.

100
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,954
Natural redhead.

101
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,580
I'll need you to change the dressing
on the fem bypass in 402,

102
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,652
and DC the staples
on the gastroplasty in post-op.

103
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:27,424
I have no idea what you just said.

104
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:31,423
I'm kidding.

105
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:34,818
Looks like you won
the med student raffle there, pal.

106
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,473
- Introduce me.
- Excuse me?

107
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,707
You give me her name
and tell her my name,

108
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:45,437
or you go her name,
my name, my name, her name.

109
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:48,354
No. You like Carla.

110
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:51,352
Do you actually listen
to yourself when you speak,

111
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:53,593
or do you find you drift in and out?

112
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:57,848
Fine. Then I'm gonna go ahead

113
00:06:58,064 --> 00:07:01,579
and continue to focus
all my energies on Carla.

114
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:03,455
Listening, watching...

115
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,743
...waiting.

116
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,050
Dr Cox, Kristen.
Kristen, Dr Cox.

117
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:17,140
Josh, I asked you
to get this guy's history an hour ago.

118
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,611
It should've taken five minutes.

119
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:24,072
We were just talking.
This guy, he is the bomb!

120
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,376
OK. Bye-bye. Moving on.

121
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,189
Help someone else. I'm sorry about that.

122
00:07:29,387 --> 00:07:31,378
Relax, Bambi. Be nice to Thumper.

123
00:07:31,555 --> 00:07:33,910
He wrote ''The guy sweats
when he exercises.''

124
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,852
- I do.
- I'll call Ripley's!

125
00:07:36,018 --> 00:07:38,373
Relax. It's just one mistake.

126
00:07:40,064 --> 00:07:41,417
Relax, Bambi.

127
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:43,556
It's just one mistake.

128
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:48,250
- Good night, Thumper.
- Cool! Great first day, Dr Dorian.

129
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:51,170
Yeah, it was.

130
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:55,751
- Relax. It's just one mistake.
- Yes! They're each one mistake.

131
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:58,750
Put 'em all together,
it makes four million.

132
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:02,587
Did you just snap at me?
Because I think he just snapped at me.

133
00:08:02,837 --> 00:08:04,828
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you are.

134
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,962
Carla, I gotta go home.

135
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:09,647
You have to co-sign all these orders,

136
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:13,883
fill out a vascular consult on bed three
and get a tox screen for Mrs O'Brien.

137
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,611
- But Josh did all this.
- Honey, I don't think so.

138
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:40,151
Mrs O'Brien, I'm afraid
I'm gonna need a urine sample.

139
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,537
I hope you're taking
very good care of my hospital.

140
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:46,745
You're darn tootin'.

141
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:52,208
Jackass. Dr Reid, say hello
to Whitaker Chambers.

142
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,381
- What up?
- ''What up''?

143
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:57,584
Whitaker Chambers is the CEO

144
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,361
of the corporation
that owns this hospital,

145
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:04,440
so I suggest you stop
acting like LL Cool Reid

146
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,363
and start acting like Dr Reid.

147
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:09,001
You dig?

148
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:12,065
- Why would he want to meet me?
- Hey, Dad.

149
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:15,079
Hey, son!

150
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:17,161
Poopies.

151
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:23,278
- It was really nice to meet you.
- Same here, doctor.

152
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:27,080
I'm sorry. Dr Cox,

153
00:09:27,254 --> 00:09:30,212
I was gonna take Kristen
out for a beer after work.

154
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:32,858
Would you like to join us?

155
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:37,504
No. I can't do it.

156
00:09:37,723 --> 00:09:39,714
No!

157
00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:42,565
- Is he OK?
- Not really.

158
00:09:45,022 --> 00:09:47,172
Dr Dorian?

159
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:54,085
Your roommate let me in.

160
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:56,393
Cool dead dog. Can I pet him?

161
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:57,724
<i>Is he kidding?</i>

162
00:09:57,868 --> 00:10:01,304
I came by because I know
I didn't do so great yesterday...

163
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,894
What is it that tipped you off?

164
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,712
Was it your inability to
perform even the simplest task?

165
00:10:07,962 --> 00:10:10,556
I'll bet it was that
I got home 20 minutes ago

166
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:14,351
because I spent the entire night
cleaning up after you.

167
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:18,984
I'm sorry.
I was just really scared.

168
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:22,337
You know what, Josh?
You should be scared.

169
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,199
Because I gotta be honest with you.

170
00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:28,194
I don't think you got what it takes.

171
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,788
Do you?

172
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:36,396
I didn't think so.

173
00:10:40,077 --> 00:10:44,150
I'm still not gonna feel bad
about what I said to Josh.

174
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,552
You don't scare me, woman.

175
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:52,640
I'm so sorry. I'll apologise at rounds.

176
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,229
Nurse Roberts, have you seen Josh?

177
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:58,179
The tall skinny one? He quit.

178
00:10:58,387 --> 00:11:00,537
Nice job, Bambi.

179
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:03,920
I didn't mean for that to happen.
I didn't.

180
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:06,577
You don't have to apologise to me.

181
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:09,205
You will have to answer to Jesus.

182
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:21,271
<i>After what happened,</i>
<i>I did what any good person would do.</i>

183
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:24,611
<i>I went looking for confirmation</i>
<i>that it wasn't my fault.</i>

184
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:27,044
Here's what happened.

185
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,278
He was screwing up constantly.

186
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,098
I didn't force him to quit.

187
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:34,643
I don't think it's my fault he quit.

188
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,832
Most of the bad things
that happen here are your fault.

189
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:40,885
- I was talking to her.
- I won't say what you wanna hear.

190
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:44,373
Nurse Roberts says he's the most
incompetent doctor she's worked with.

191
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,876
Laverne, what'd you say about JD
when he first started working here?

192
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:51,016
He was the most incompetent
doctor I ever worked with.

193
00:11:51,232 --> 00:11:53,507
- It's not my fault he failed.
- You failed.

194
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,843
You're supposed to be his teacher.

195
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:02,073
See, to me that sounds like
it's your fault. I don't know.

196
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:04,237
Shocker. Yeah.

197
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:07,370
Where you going? Stay and play!

198
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:19,006
So you're having trouble
asking out Kristen.

199
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,330
- No problem.
- Whoa, Curly.

200
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:23,901
I got no problem. Wanna have a drink?

201
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:25,816
- No.
- See? I'm fine.

202
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:29,285
You know how men are always
talking about themselves?

203
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,795
Women like to talk
about themselves more.

204
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:34,336
Thank you.
You've touched me deeply.

205
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:36,834
You can be cynical,
but I'm telling you,

206
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:41,067
get Kristen to talk about herself,
it's on. It's on and poppin'.

207
00:12:41,324 --> 00:12:44,680
- If that doesn't work, do what I do.
- Which is what?

208
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,357
- Show her the booty!
- No. You put that away.

209
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:53,298
Think of the children.

210
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:55,770
Doctor!

211
00:12:55,963 --> 00:13:00,559
Philip, I was wondering if you could
write out this discharge summary.

212
00:13:00,843 --> 00:13:02,515
Where's the fun?

213
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:04,316
- Excuse me?
- From now on,

214
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:06,747
when you're wondering whether
I'll do something,

215
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,163
ask yourself, ''Where's the fun?''

216
00:13:09,352 --> 00:13:11,661
lt'll be a timesaver for both of us.

217
00:13:11,854 --> 00:13:15,369
I'm betting that
if you were really honest with yourself,

218
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:20,204
you'd realise how unsatisfying it is
to ride on your father's coattails.

219
00:13:21,197 --> 00:13:23,347
No, I'm OK with it.

220
00:13:28,704 --> 00:13:31,696
Josh, this is completely crazy.

221
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:34,115
You told me I shouldn't be a doctor.

222
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:36,807
Kidding... Josh.

223
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:41,395
You know what? Forget all of that.
You have to hang in there.

224
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:44,474
Now, I promise you,
I am gonna help you.

225
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,749
Here we go.

226
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,973
You're doing it.

227
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:53,176
Yeah, you are!
You're doing it!

228
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:58,226
- So, what do you say?
- I know what you're trying to do.

229
00:13:58,484 --> 00:14:01,123
My whole life,
people have felt sorry for me.

230
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,676
- Why would anyone feel sorry for you?
- I'm clumsy,

231
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:07,580
I'm always throwing up,
I don't even have an ass!

232
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:11,494
Those are the same things I was
dealing with when I started here.

233
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:14,864
Except for the ass part.
I actually have a great ass.

234
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:17,359
It's firm like mutton.

235
00:14:17,545 --> 00:14:19,581
I'm not buying it, Dr Dorian.

236
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:22,664
But thanks for trying.

237
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:27,737
- So, where you from?
- Chicago. You?

238
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,605
- Pittsburgh. Family? Brothers, sisters?
- One older brother. You?

239
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:36,447
We're gonna keep the focus on you.
Are your parents still together?

240
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:38,164
Yep.

241
00:14:38,316 --> 00:14:41,274
Do you have any idea how hard
you're making this on me?

242
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:44,318
No, but I wonder if someone
slipped something into my soda.

243
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,363
He has that effect on everyone
the first few weeks.

244
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:52,148
I gotta go. We'll pick this up later.

245
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:54,726
Pick what up?

246
00:14:57,877 --> 00:14:59,390
What up, dawg?

247
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:01,934
Not a strong move
with the tighty-whities.

248
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,672
If you won't help,
go wait for your trust fund to mature.

249
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:17,090
- Dr Reid, can I see you a minute?
- Dr Kelso, I am so, so sorry.

250
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:20,586
I just got so frustrated,
plus I'm PMSing.

251
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:24,126
Well, the pill plays havoc
with my cycle. I'm like...

252
00:15:24,362 --> 00:15:25,636
Dr Reid?

253
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,816
You talk too much. It's a problem.

254
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,299
Why are you doing
your med student's work?

255
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:33,485
- Well, his father...
- I hate his father.

256
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:36,662
But I'm the one who has
to suck up to him, not you.

257
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:40,583
For God's sake, woman,
show some <i>cojones!</i>

258
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,656
<i>It's hard trying to figure out</i>
<i>how to reach somebody.</i>

259
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:52,481
<i>The thing is to think</i>
<i>of someone I look up to,</i>

260
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:54,877
<i>and remember</i>
<i>how they got through to me.</i>

261
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:57,448
The only way you could
be less productive

262
00:15:57,645 --> 00:16:00,239
is if you were the wall
on which you're leaning.

263
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:03,078
But then you'd be providing some jackass

264
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:06,951
with a wall on which to lean
and reflect on what a jackass he is.

265
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:10,871
I know. Here it's a conundrum.
But don't you worry about it.

266
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:14,189
I'll tackle that one right upstairs.
In the meantime,

267
00:16:14,412 --> 00:16:16,528
you could pretend
to be doing some work.

268
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:19,459
And, even though
you don't have your basket,

269
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,977
it's just a terrific time
for you to skip away, Shirley.

270
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:24,964
Skip away.

271
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:28,123
Skip away. Go ahead.

272
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:35,653
- Hello, Philip.
- Lemon head.

273
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:38,845
Yeah, I get it, cos of the hair.

274
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,851
I was hard on you from the start,

275
00:16:41,022 --> 00:16:44,378
but, on the other hand, as you know,
you're an incredible tool.

276
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:48,158
So I'll lay off if you drop
the attitude, and we'll start fresh.

277
00:16:48,404 --> 00:16:50,918
- What do you say?
- I don't wanna.

278
00:16:51,115 --> 00:16:54,824
But, if you've got a problem with that,
go see my father.

279
00:16:55,077 --> 00:16:57,193
I think I'll do that.

280
00:16:57,371 --> 00:17:00,169
Wait, Dr Reid.

281
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:05,402
I had some time to think about it and,
what the hell? Let's start fresh.

282
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:08,273
Philly...

283
00:17:08,466 --> 00:17:10,457
I don't wanna.

284
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:13,831
Sorry we got interrupted before.

285
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:17,369
- It's OK.
- Where were we?

286
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,910
I told you my parents were
still married, you yelled at me.

287
00:17:21,145 --> 00:17:23,705
Right. Of course I did.
That's me all over.

288
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:28,210
- Why are you washing your hands?
- I don't honestly know.

289
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:31,364
I guess I don't have
anything of interest to say.

290
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:34,006
I got something to say.

291
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,351
Dr Cox, you are an attending,
so you should know

292
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:41,730
it's inappropriate for you to be
sniffing around this woman all day!

293
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:45,548
And you! You are a med student
who should be learning from me,

294
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:48,673
but every time I turn around,
you're talking to him.

295
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:52,999
So I'm telling you, I forbid you
to get involved with that guy.

296
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:55,377
Sorry, doctor.

297
00:17:55,638 --> 00:18:01,156
You do realise that you just effectively
signed your own death warrant.

298
00:18:01,477 --> 00:18:05,072
Dude, do you, like,
know any women at all?

299
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:10,854
Hi.

300
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:15,306
I know we're not supposed to be
seeing each other, but...

301
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:22,267
Why did you page me?

302
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:24,970
I don't know why I still
have this thing on.

303
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:28,443
Put your gloves on, Josh.
I need you to get an ABG.

304
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:31,026
- I can't.
- Newbie, wait.

305
00:18:31,215 --> 00:18:32,694
''Newbie''?

306
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:35,914
You're the only one who knows
if you wanna be a doctor.

307
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:38,526
But right now I got my hands full. OK?

308
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:43,114
What do you say you put some gloves on,
Shirley, and get the hell in here?

309
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:50,917
Now, locate the radial pulse.

310
00:18:52,987 --> 00:18:55,785
Josh, look at me. You can do this.

311
00:19:03,581 --> 00:19:05,572
It looks good.

312
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:09,398
No way.

313
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:13,136
What do you want, a cookie?
Put your scrubs on and get back here.

314
00:19:13,382 --> 00:19:15,373
Go, go, go!

315
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:19,908
Go ahead.

316
00:19:20,097 --> 00:19:22,088
That's it.

317
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:26,335
- Could you redo that?
- Yeah.

318
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:29,304
Could I get some more wine?

319
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:33,714
Puh-lease, keep drinking.

320
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:38,104
I'm throwing myself at you, and
you're still trying to get me drunk.

321
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:42,996
Well, baby, you gotta
play all 48 minutes.

322
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:46,965
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

323
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,645
This is fun.

324
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:52,103
I love the part right before
we start hating each other.

325
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:54,932
- Really?
- You wanna know something?

326
00:19:55,132 --> 00:19:56,929
What?

327
00:19:57,093 --> 00:20:00,802
I feel like I'm using you
to get past another person.

328
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:03,171
That's not as se<i>xy</i> as you think it is.

329
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:05,305
It's this nurse.

330
00:20:05,476 --> 00:20:09,674
This unavailable nurse?
I swear...

331
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:13,090
Look, Kristen, I think you're great,

332
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:15,785
but this whole thing's
just not fair to you.

333
00:20:15,987 --> 00:20:18,945
If it's OK with you,

334
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:23,707
I think I'll go ahead
and decide what's fair to me.

335
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:38,707
That works for everybody.

336
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,432
Perry?

337
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:44,030
Actually, I prefer ''Dr Cox''.

338
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:47,742
You like strong women, don't you?

339
00:20:47,935 --> 00:20:51,610
Are you kidding me? They're
the only ones I let ruin my life.

340
00:20:56,944 --> 00:21:00,983
- This is way too easy.
- Bring it on!

341
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,832
Stop talking.

342
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,211
Dr Reid, I wrote out your admission
orders and got the blood cultures.

343
00:21:09,498 --> 00:21:12,137
Good. Now, beat it. I'm eating.

344
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:18,721
- Elliot, you ball-buster!
- I know! Isn't it great?

345
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:21,727
<i>A lot of us freak out</i>
<i>when med students come.</i>

346
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:25,398
<i>It feels like being forced</i>
<i>to accept new people into your family.</i>

347
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,676
<i>It changes everything.</i>

348
00:21:28,392 --> 00:21:33,386
<i>Me, I was more struck by how</i>
<i>these newbies made me look at myself.</i>

349
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:35,680
<i>Who I used to be,...</i>

350
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:39,536
<i>...who I am now,...</i>

351
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:42,376
<i>...and who I might</i>
<i>some day become.</i>

352
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:45,235
<i>But hopefully, not too soon.</i>

353
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:47,718
- <i>Player</i>
- <i>Hold me down</i>

354
00:21:47,912 --> 00:21:50,107
- Such dorks.
- My God!

355
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:51,847
''My God!''

356
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
