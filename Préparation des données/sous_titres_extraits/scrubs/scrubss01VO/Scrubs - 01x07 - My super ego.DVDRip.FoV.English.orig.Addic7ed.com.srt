1
00:00:05,903 --> 00:00:08,781
Let's start off with a toughie.
Who can tell me...?

2
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:11,742
<i>The last few weeks,</i>
<i>an amazing thing has happened.</i>

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,909
<i>I've been nailing rounds. I'm starting</i>
<i>to separate myself from the pack.</i>

4
00:00:16,163 --> 00:00:18,916
Sir, the answer is Beck's triad.

5
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:22,158
<i>It keeps me on top of my game.</i>

6
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:24,930
Looks like a break in the ulna,
right there.

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,166
<i>It's good to be the king.</i>

8
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:32,051
You know, it's OK to be impressed by me.
Most girls are.

9
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:35,304
<i>The problem with reaching the top</i>
<i>is, sooner or later,</i>

10
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:37,790
<i>someone starts nipping at your heels.</i>

11
00:00:37,976 --> 00:00:40,012
<i>For me, that guy was Nick Murdoch.</i>

12
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:48,431
Well, the gurney adds drama.

13
00:01:06,838 --> 00:01:09,432
<i>So that's the guy</i>
<i>who wants to take me down.</i>

14
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,589
Of course, you'll have a scar, Peter.

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,198
You're not getting surgery but chicks
dig scars so I'm gonna give you one.

16
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,786
Doctor, Peter's drug rash
is getting a lot worse.

17
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,136
No problem, give him Prednisone...

18
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:27,147
<i>Good bedside manner,</i>
<i>good rapport with the nurses,</i>

19
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,919
<i>sees me staring at him...</i>

20
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,068
<i>Act busy.</i>

21
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,629
That's the stud right there.
That's where you'd...

22
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:37,425
...hang a painting.

23
00:01:37,578 --> 00:01:41,412
He was born John Dorian
but he was simply known as JD:

24
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:44,657
doctor, friend, lover.

25
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:48,073
- Hey, man, how are ya?
- Hey, how are you?

26
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:50,291
OK... There that is.

27
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:52,581
Gosh, can you believe we're doctors?

28
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,547
The other night at a restaurant
this guy starts choking.

29
00:01:56,805 --> 00:02:00,036
They asked if anyone was a doctor.
I didn't even move.

30
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:04,465
I still feel like I'm seven years old
playing MASH with my older brother.

31
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,119
I don't want
to be Hot Lips again.

32
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:09,307
Shut up and kiss Frank.

33
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:14,212
I don't talk to my brother much.

34
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:16,681
<i>What you doing?</i>
<i>Don't connect with him.</i>

35
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:19,176
- Well, I'll see you.
- OK.

36
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:21,405
What happened to that guy?

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,299
Eventually I remembered I was a doctor.

38
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:27,377
He'd been dead for 20 minutes.
Very embarrassing.

39
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:29,497
Food was good, though.

40
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:32,265
<i>Don't laugh. Don't laugh!</i>

41
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,539
<i>Damn!</i>

42
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:40,092
Any time you wanna get more gauze,
it'd be a real treat for all of us.

43
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:44,869
- It's hard being you, isn't it?
- It is.

44
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:48,061
- What's with the smile?
- This whole big bad wolf thing,

45
00:02:48,273 --> 00:02:50,264
it's such an act.

46
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:53,676
Neato!
Now whaddya want? A tip?

47
00:02:53,862 --> 00:02:56,535
Get out. Go, go!

48
00:02:57,032 --> 00:02:58,829
I'm not sure I agree.

49
00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:10,374
- You good T-dog?
- Come on, man.

50
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:12,934
I could do this with my eyes closed.

51
00:03:13,674 --> 00:03:16,825
- I won't, though.
- Open the peritoneum.

52
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:20,727
Nice, clean cut. Good.

53
00:03:20,973 --> 00:03:24,124
Good. Whoa, what's that smell?

54
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:26,148
I don't know.

55
00:03:26,311 --> 00:03:28,267
- Did you nick the colon?
- No.

56
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:31,077
I mean, I don't know.
I... I don't think so. Did I?

57
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:33,027
Cut the music.

58
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:35,991
You know, I kinda
had a date last night.

59
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:37,595
- Really?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,334
A guy on the bus fell asleep on me
and drooled on my shoulder.

61
00:03:41,577 --> 00:03:44,045
- You slut.
- Yeah.

62
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:48,239
- How about Nick?
- I'd let him drool on me.

63
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,697
That's gross. Why did I say that?
I shouldn't talk to people.

64
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,037
I wouldn't know what to do
even if I was interested.

65
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:57,771
Well, you could start by looking at him.

66
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,120
Did he look back?
Why doesn't he like me?

67
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:04,103
I can't believe I already blew it.

68
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:08,259
<i>It felt weird trying to push Nick on</i>
<i>her. This morning I wanted to kill him.</i>

69
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,273
<i>He's so nice,</i>
<i>he probably would've helped me.</i>

70
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:15,872
Come on, JD, you're not closing the
windpipe. Put more pressure down here.

71
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:19,702
Come on! I know you can do it!
Come on! Come on!

72
00:04:20,657 --> 00:04:23,808
If it isn't the brain trust.

73
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:27,312
Someone tell me
what this patient's rash is.

74
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:30,133
You have until I finish
my squeezy juice.

75
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:32,052
<i>My God, I'm drawing a...</i>

76
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,247
<i>I can't remember what you draw</i>
<i>when your mind draws a...</i>

77
00:04:35,464 --> 00:04:36,499
<i>...something.</i>

78
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:40,068
- It's Erythema Migrans.
- Why don't you answer it?

79
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:44,341
Everyone looks up to you. It's
important you don't get stumped.

80
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:46,714
Besides, it's important to you, too.

81
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:49,770
<i>Please, like he knows me.</i>

82
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:51,809
It's Erythema Migrans, sir.

83
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:55,264
Right you are, Dr Dorian.

84
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:57,273
Nice.

85
00:04:58,153 --> 00:05:00,064
OK, there you go.

86
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:02,958
Now you've got it. Oh, good.

87
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:06,070
I don't know
where that smell came from.

88
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:09,244
- Er, sir?
- What? Do you see something?

89
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:13,608
Sir, I farted.
That smell is from the fart I made.

90
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:17,916
- Dude...
- Get the hell out of my OR.

91
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:20,243
Yes, sir. Good.

92
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,946
<i>Time to put myself</i>
<i>right back on top of Nick.</i>

93
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,579
<i>That came out wrong.</i>

94
00:05:26,723 --> 00:05:30,033
Excuse me, Dr Cox?
I know that you need to pick an intern

95
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:32,783
to co-write that case report
on post-partum...

96
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,210
Yeah, sure. Congratulations. Now, go.

97
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,151
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

98
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:39,467
Hey, buddy. How are ya?

99
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:44,647
Dr Cox, I was wondering if I could
co-write that case report with you.

100
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,705
Newbie à Newbie. Too bad it can't be
a fight to the death.

101
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:53,785
I didn't know you wanted to do it.
You do it.

102
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:56,112
Nice guys aren't even that nice.

103
00:05:56,295 --> 00:06:01,574
Now let me see, just exactly
who to choose? Who to choose?

104
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:16,979
Nice. Very nice, indeed.
OK, over.

105
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:23,144
Interesting.

106
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:26,419
Attaboy.

107
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:30,935
I'm gonna go with...
Guy Smiley, here.

108
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,733
- Huge moment for me.
- I know.

109
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:40,116
I wish my dad was alive.

110
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:42,800
<i>It doesn't mean anything.</i>

111
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:45,002
You flipped a coin in your head?

112
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:50,046
No. It's just that, right now, he's
better at internal medicine than you.

113
00:06:54,353 --> 00:06:56,787
OK, insult me, like you always do.

114
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,893
Too easy.
When you least expect it.

115
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,572
Dr Wen threatened
to sew my butt cheeks together.

116
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:10,252
- Yet you continue to eat chilli.
- Dude, I'm taking the cheese off.

117
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,421
Even though nothing happened today,
it still kinda freaked me out.

118
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,462
One hiccup and that's the difference
between life and death?

119
00:07:20,712 --> 00:07:23,943
It's a lot to have
on your shoulders, you know?

120
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:29,490
What are you guys talking about?

121
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,033
Cheese.

122
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:34,969
Turk is so lucky
I met him first.

123
00:07:35,227 --> 00:07:37,422
How's my man doing?

124
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:39,799
Baby, most guys are here.

125
00:07:39,982 --> 00:07:43,213
But me, I'm, like,
all up in here.

126
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:46,401
Dr Turk, you can
make the incision now.

127
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:51,618
Sir, my hand's tightening up.

128
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:55,820
- I must be low on potassium.
- All right, I'll take over.

129
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:05,189
Dr Murdoch, Peter's rash has gone but
he's vomited six times in the last hour.

130
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:09,253
No problem, give him Zofran and
a 20cc per kilo bolus of normal saline.

131
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:13,220
<i>Everyone's finally coming around</i>
<i>to my way of thinking about Nick.</i>

132
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:16,306
You're right, he definitely
has a cute little butt.

133
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:19,316
It's almost like
it's been sculpted.

134
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:22,877
Who cares? Everybody's got
a cute butt. I have a cute butt.

135
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:25,668
You should bring it in some day.

136
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:30,377
- How's Turk doing?
- He's fine, why?

137
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:34,692
He totally froze during surgery
yesterday. Didn't he tell you?

138
00:08:37,873 --> 00:08:42,424
I feel like we haven't talked in ages.
How are you?

139
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:44,030
- Fine.
- Yeah?

140
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:47,208
Don't I look OK?
You know?

141
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:55,307
You know? I'm fine.
As a matter of fact...

142
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:59,508
<i>I am doin' OK, I am doin' OK</i>

143
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:03,955
Good afternoon, doctors.

144
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:07,459
I've gathered you all here
because, well...

145
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:12,165
Attendance at my noon conferences
has been very disappointing.

146
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:16,840
I've begun to wonder if maybe
you have something more important to do.

147
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:22,604
Maybe you feel the need to sneak off
and have a little nappy-nap?

148
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:26,262
I love nappy-naps.

149
00:09:26,463 --> 00:09:31,776
Or maybe you've forgotten that
my conferences are mandatory.

150
00:09:32,094 --> 00:09:34,403
My hospital, my rules!

151
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:37,713
I've never missed one.
Batting 1,000 over here.

152
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:43,397
I'm more proud of you than
I've ever been of an intern.

153
00:09:43,647 --> 00:09:46,844
<i>How do you like me now, Nick?</i>

154
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:51,106
So you see, sir, the poor attendance
is my fault. And my fault only.

155
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:54,321
Well, then,
you have just won the privilege

156
00:09:54,533 --> 00:10:00,051
of writing my next ten lectures
by this afternoon.

157
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,778
Paging Dr Martyr...

158
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,713
- What the hell was that guy...
- Way to go, man.

159
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:10,037
Nick, that was amazing.

160
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:14,807
<i>...thinking?</i>

161
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,880
<i>It's good to be the king.</i>

162
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:28,225
<i>Things change when</i>
<i>you're not the star any more.</i>

163
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,954
What can I say? The lectures
this kid wrote were fantastic.

164
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:39,278
<i>The hospital starts to seem</i>
<i>like a whole different place.</i>

165
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:46,710
Hey, man. Want some company?

166
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,918
No, I just wanna be alone.

167
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:56,307
- Well?
- Not yet. But soon.

168
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,148
Very soon.

169
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:06,059
Why would Turk talk to Elliot about this
and not me?

170
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:08,341
They're not friends,
know what I mean?

171
00:11:08,523 --> 00:11:11,754
After 25 minutes, the only way
I could know what you mean more

172
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:15,455
is if you wrote ''My boyfriend doesn't
open up to me'' on a mallet

173
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:18,052
and smashed me
over the head with it.

174
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:20,915
Why can't you just for once
dig down in your heart,

175
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:24,998
access some emotions
and empathise with me?

176
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,601
- I'm sorry, what were we doing?
- That's why no one likes you.

177
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:31,713
You like me a little bit.

178
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:36,112
And so do you, sweet cakes.

179
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:39,839
Want a little sugar from Daddy?

180
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:47,059
Well, looky here.
I thought this was my special place.

181
00:11:47,354 --> 00:11:50,426
I'd ask you not to tell
the others about this spot,

182
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,844
but none of them are talking to you.

183
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:55,335
It's been a rough day, sir.

184
00:11:56,196 --> 00:12:00,553
You see, Dr Dorian, your problem is,
you're a pansy.

185
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:06,059
If you were in my way,
I'd throw you off this ledge right now.

186
00:12:06,373 --> 00:12:09,524
We're out here alone.

187
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:12,743
No one would ever know.

188
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:24,099
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna... I have to...

189
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,582
...things.

190
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:32,657
Interns are fun.

191
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:37,396
I'm single.

192
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:40,722
That was more subtle in my head.

193
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:45,340
Relax, I already left a message
on your machine asking you out.

194
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:47,851
- Really?
- No.

195
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,669
- But I will before you go home.
- Works for me.

196
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:56,231
Dr Murdoch, Peter's developed
a high-grade fever and a cough.

197
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:58,861
No problem. Give him
Ceftazidime one gram IV.

198
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:02,885
- How do you stay positive?
- I don't let the bad stuff in.

199
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:05,971
Try not to get too overwhelmed.

200
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:08,378
Call me tonight
when you get my message.

201
00:13:13,232 --> 00:13:15,348
His butt?

202
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:20,994
So listen, I've scheduled
an appendectomy for you later.

203
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,708
Make sure you're good on potassium.

204
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:27,060
I got so much potassium,
it's coming out of my assium,

205
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:29,084
you know what I mean?

206
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:33,911
What I did was I took
the word potassium and...

207
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:36,721
I dropped
the first three letters,

208
00:13:36,922 --> 00:13:38,355
made a doody joke.

209
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:41,067
Funny stuff.

210
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:45,753
- Looks like he bought it.
- Excuse me?

211
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:49,283
So you had stage fright. No big deal.
Happened to me once.

212
00:13:49,518 --> 00:13:50,917
Really?

213
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:55,373
I'd be more than glad to tell you what a
lot of doctors do to relieve the stress.

214
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:57,924
Take a little trip to Palm-dale.

215
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,509
- What?
- OK.

216
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:01,928
Give yourself the old low five.

217
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:05,584
- I'm not getting it.
- Physician...

218
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:08,181
...love thyself.

219
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,565
You talking about
Downtown Lester Brown?

220
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:14,899
Lowers the heart rate, releases
endorphins. Basic physiology.

221
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:19,559
OK, you almost had me.

222
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:21,951
- You're not serious?
- Yes, I am.

223
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:24,006
- No, you're not.
- Yes.

224
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:25,610
No.

225
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:30,699
Nobody hurts Carla
and gets away with it.

226
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:32,291
Who's Carla?

227
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:35,155
I was talking to myself.
Don't eavesdrop.

228
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:38,586
If this kid doesn't leave
I'm gonna kill him.

229
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:42,950
Now, if you leave,
I'll know you were eavesdropping

230
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:45,032
and I'll go and kill you anyway.

231
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,879
Stay. Good girl.

232
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:52,642
Tick, tock, Clarice.

233
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:58,512
<i>Kelso's talk helped me</i>
<i>figure out what I had to do.</i>

234
00:14:58,712 --> 00:15:01,943
Good timing. Give me a hand
with this Foley cath, will you?

235
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:05,530
<i>Whether or not Nick knew how jealous</i>
<i>and competitive I'd been,</i>

236
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:08,321
<i>I felt I needed to step up,</i>
<i>lay it out there,</i>

237
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:10,743
<i>and apologise like a man.</i>

238
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:12,924
Are we cool?

239
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:14,454
Yeah.

240
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:18,881
<i>Besides, even if I was the star</i>
<i>for a little while, he's the man now.</i>

241
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:21,140
This belongs to you.

242
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:24,276
Thanks a lot, man.
Can you grab me some tape?

243
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:28,276
<i>Once you line up behind a strong leader,</i>
<i>everyone picks up their game.</i>

244
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,763
We need the results
of this urine sample.

245
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:33,547
<i>We began to function</i>
<i>like a well-oiled machine.</i>

246
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:16,559
Nick, I got the results back
from the...

247
00:16:17,874 --> 00:16:18,863
Nick?

248
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:22,437
His blood cultures
don't look good at all.

249
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:24,662
No problem.

250
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:41,873
Listen, I was thinking about
what happened earlier and...

251
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:44,788
Anyway... Here.

252
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:49,910
You dug down in your heart
and came up with a muffin.

253
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:53,391
That's store-bought.
Blueberries the size of your fist.

254
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:57,089
I shouldn't have dragged you
into it. You don't know Turk.

255
00:16:57,331 --> 00:17:01,609
Actually, I met him today.
We had a terrific chat.

256
00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:08,005
Give the man a hand,
that's just terrific work.

257
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:10,249
You know darn well that felt good.

258
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:12,782
Feeling better about yourself,
aren't you?

259
00:17:12,971 --> 00:17:14,370
Real nice guy.

260
00:17:14,514 --> 00:17:18,712
It's hard letting yourself be vulnerable
with someone, you know?

261
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:21,491
Just eat the damn muffin.

262
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:29,492
Even though I'm on call tonight,
I'm not gonna let the bad stuff in.

263
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:32,127
Not gonna let myself get overwhelmed.
What?

264
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:35,999
Friday, when you had people over,
you locked yourself in your room

265
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:39,794
- because we brought the wrong chips.
- Look at me.

266
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,156
That was the old Elliot.

267
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:46,691
Help me find Dr Murdoch. Peter's parents
are here, he's not answering his page.

268
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:51,242
Sure. You know, Elliot's not gonna
let herself be overwhelmed any more.

269
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:04,447
She's been drinking.

270
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,541
- You look great!
- You're not messing with me?

271
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:17,900
No, but I'd like to.

272
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,398
Turk bought me this dress out of
the blue. I guess he knew I'd love it.

273
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:27,311
Look, Carla,
back when I was an intern,

274
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:29,935
I remember the pressure
being so insane,

275
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:32,851
that the only way I could get by
was to race home

276
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:38,569
and although my wife was asleep,
I'd wake her, look her in the eyes,

277
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,324
and then passive-aggressively
torture her

278
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:46,034
until she packed a bag
and went to her mom's for the week.

279
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:48,067
Does that...help?

280
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:50,349
Like a big hug with words.

281
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:53,803
Just cos a guy
has problems expressing himself,

282
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:56,625
that doesn't mean
he doesn't need...

283
00:18:57,326 --> 00:18:58,998
...you.

284
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:02,691
Women so don't get me.

285
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:06,388
It's not even funny.
It's mind-boggling, quite frankly.

286
00:19:06,627 --> 00:19:08,583
The whole thing is stunning.

287
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:10,904
The point is that
it's the scrubs, right.

288
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:14,240
Because in jeans, my butt
is a force to be reckoned with.

289
00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:18,427
- We were looking for you.
- Nick, touch my butt, please.

290
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:23,162
Are you all right?

291
00:19:23,894 --> 00:19:26,454
That kid is eventually gonna die.

292
00:19:26,647 --> 00:19:29,559
Whether it's today or tomorrow.

293
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:32,653
Or a month from now.

294
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:35,056
There's nothing I can do. Nothing works.

295
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:38,197
His parents wanna talk to me.
What am I supposed to say?

296
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:42,242
Peter lived a good long seven years?
Seven years, man.

297
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:49,007
It's not fair.
I hate this place, this job.

298
00:19:49,294 --> 00:19:52,047
- Nick, it's not your fault.
- I can't do it any more.

299
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:55,248
I'm done. I'm done.

300
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:59,745
<i>The scariest thing was I thought</i>
<i>he was stronger than all of us.</i>

301
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:02,129
<i>Maybe it's not about being the best.</i>

302
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:06,061
<i>Maybe it's about finding little things</i>
<i>that get you through the day.</i>

303
00:20:06,311 --> 00:20:09,030
<i>Whether it's the support</i>
<i>of someone close to you,</i>

304
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,937
<i>or letting yourself feel overwhelmed,</i>

305
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:19,636
<i>if only for a moment.</i>

306
00:20:22,703 --> 00:20:26,412
<i>Or being selfless every once in a while.</i>

307
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:33,964
<i>I don't know.</i>

308
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:37,601
<i>I guess in the end,</i>
<i>it's about surviving,</i>

309
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:39,242
<i>any way you can.</i>

310
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:45,304
See you tomorrow.

311
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:52,358
You're stupid.

312
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:56,639
- That's it?
- Give it time. It'll eat at you.

313
00:21:02,117 --> 00:21:05,268
- Am I stupid?
- Yeah, a little bit.

314
00:21:06,121 --> 00:21:08,077
Damn him!

315
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
