1
00:00:05,342 --> 00:00:08,618
<i>Oh, my God, I can't</i>
<i>believe I'm about to do this.</i>

2
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:10,165
What's wrong?

3
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:13,695
- I lost my mop.
- Really?

4
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:17,521
No. But that's the only thing
that could make me unhappy, right?

5
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:20,524
You people think of me
as nothing but The Janitor.

6
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:23,805
- That's not true.
- What's my name?

7
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:28,802
I know that the nurses
call you Sir Plunge-a-lot.

8
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:31,024
- I know.
- Come on.

9
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:35,114
- I'm sure you don't know my name so...
- John Michael Dorian.

10
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:39,445
- How did you know my middle name?
- Because I care.

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,385
<i>Today seems like a good day to</i>
<i>hide out in one of my patient's rooms.</i>

12
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,860
You, my friend,
are an incompetent fool!

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,359
<i>Unless, of course,</i>
<i>my patient is missing.</i>

14
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:50,224
Where's my brother?

15
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:55,586
Say, ''I don't know,'' I'll show you what
I learned in my crotch-punching class.

16
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:59,681
I think it's great that
you're going back to school.

17
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:03,851
Why would he wander off?
Oh, maybe he went to a real hospital.

18
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:06,179
He found out
he had leukaemia yesterday.

19
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:09,911
That's life-changing news. You
can't be surprised if he's depressed.

20
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:12,265
Hey, doc!

21
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:15,242
This guy's got something
on his shoulder. Take a look.

22
00:01:15,454 --> 00:01:18,207
Ben, put the small children down.

23
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:20,087
Is anybody missing one of these?

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,161
OK!

25
00:01:22,336 --> 00:01:24,611
You heard the doctor.
Sit this one out.

26
00:01:24,797 --> 00:01:26,674
- Please...
- My hands are free to...

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,593
No, no, Ben! Seriously, Ben!
Ben! No, come on, Ben!

28
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:32,680
Stop, Ben. Put me down. Ben!

29
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:36,244
Faster!

30
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:40,285
Eagle!

31
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,032
You had enough?

32
00:01:47,486 --> 00:01:49,636
- Sad.
- You want a turn?

33
00:01:49,822 --> 00:01:53,735
- Come on.
- Don't you dare! Don't you dare! No!

34
00:01:53,992 --> 00:01:57,462
- No! Ben, put me down! No!
- Get a shot of the mean lady.

35
00:01:57,705 --> 00:02:00,299
Hey, shorty.
You short person,

36
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:04,697
you take that picture, you'll be glad
you're in a hospital. Help!

37
00:02:19,476 --> 00:02:21,910
You've got
a Christmas card right there.

38
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:25,699
You're funny. I don't understand why
you refuse to put on a gown.

39
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:28,501
Because I don't
like people to see my bum.

40
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:31,413
- So wear underwear.
- You know how I feel about underwear.

41
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:33,968
Every girl who came to our
house in the mid-'80s

42
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:36,718
- knows how you feel.
- Sweatpants years.

43
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,789
I don't like that much freedom down
there. Makes me tingle in my giblets.

44
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,349
If you don't
start taking this seriously...

45
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:47,376
<i>I'm a good intern, but when</i>
<i>you're dealing with disease and family,</i>

46
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:50,302
<i>an intern just doesn't cut it.</i>
<i>What you need...</i>

47
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:52,706
<i>...is a hero.</i>

48
00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:55,755
Shut up. Shut up.
And definitely shut up.

49
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:57,324
But, I didn't say any...

50
00:02:57,473 --> 00:03:00,704
I know, but I enjoy saying it to you.
OK, here's the deal.

51
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:03,767
If we're gonna beat this thing,
and we damn sure are,

52
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:05,810
we'll do it one way
and one way only:

53
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:09,735
- We're gonna be a team, team, team.
- I hear you, Dr Cox.

54
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:12,863
I am so not speaking to you,
Rhonda, thank you.

55
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:14,949
I'm sorry, I'm very excited. Go!

56
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:17,629
What do you say, children?
Are we a team?

57
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:20,181
I'm in.

58
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:22,327
Go Team Cancer.

59
00:03:22,498 --> 00:03:24,295
<i>Wow, he did it.</i>

60
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,336
I've got to go take care
of some other patients.

61
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:34,404
I don't believe it. I didn't
get tomorrow's Whipple procedure.

62
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:36,387
- I know.
- This is ridiculous.

63
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:37,542
Calm down.

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,356
What's a brother got to do to get a
Whipple? What's a brother got to do?

65
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:45,794
Listen. You've got to stop
turning your medical training

66
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:50,060
into some ego-driven contest.
No one else is doing that.

67
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:52,672
Oh, I got the Whipple.

68
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:54,692
Suck it, Turk.

69
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:57,297
- I will end her.
- No, no.

70
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:59,209
- Dude, let her go.
- Let go of me.

71
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:01,677
It'll be so hot.

72
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,388
Can you tell me the treatment regimen
for organophosphate toxicity, Dr Reid?

73
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,780
I would give
intramuscular epinephrine,

74
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:13,113
then IV calcium gluconate,
and emergency haemodialysis.

75
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,696
If I wanted you
to give me three wrong answers in a row

76
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:20,158
I would have just asked
for ''the usual.''

77
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:22,186
Dr Murphy, care to jump in?

78
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:24,704
I think it's...

79
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:27,453
- Do you have a speech impediment?
- Excuse me?

80
00:04:27,646 --> 00:04:30,558
You insist on starting
every answer with ''um.''

81
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:33,083
So you've either got a speech impediment

82
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:36,952
or you're a stammering know-nothing
who doesn't belong in medicine.

83
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:39,624
Well spoken.

84
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:41,978
Now, get out!
All of you! Get out!

85
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:43,958
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

86
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:48,573
Jumpin' Jupiter,
I do enjoy the tough love.

87
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:51,864
They probably like it too,
whether they admit it or not.

88
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:53,964
Well...

89
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:58,966
''Oh, the old guy's so tough on me,
but I love him.'' Right?

90
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:02,014
Right? They hate you, Bob.

91
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:05,498
They hate you from your hooves
to the top of your pitchfork.

92
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:10,083
They hate you,
dear God, they hate you good.

93
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:11,789
What're you laughing at?

94
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,774
That ''hooves'' and ''pitchfork'' part.

95
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:19,020
- Why?
- No reason.

96
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:25,186
Now, do you think you can make
Ben behave like a patient or not?

97
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:27,490
No problem.

98
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:31,858
- I got him to put his gown on.
- He sure did.

99
00:05:32,086 --> 00:05:35,203
And now my butt itches on
account of this scratchy chair.

100
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:36,696
What're we watching?

101
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,118
<i>Wings.</i> And shut up,
I like the cab driver. He slays me.

102
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:43,901
Antonio. Played by
the actor Tony Shalhoub,

103
00:05:44,098 --> 00:05:47,056
also particularly fantastic
in a film called <i>Big Night.</i>

104
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:50,737
Congratulations. Your DiMaggio-like
streak for saying nothing

105
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:55,416
even remotely interesting
is still alive and well.

106
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:57,729
<i>I didn't care about the abuse.</i>

107
00:05:57,903 --> 00:06:01,612
<i>The most amazing thing was to</i>
<i>watch how Dr Cox dealt with his friend.</i>

108
00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:03,776
<i>How he made him feel safe.</i>

109
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:07,227
- Do I have to get a special doctor?
- An oncologist.

110
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:10,730
Do we have to talk about this? You
must have something else on your mind.

111
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:15,270
Nope. Just pretty much
that leukaemia thing.

112
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:19,619
Ben, leukaemia is a petty, ugly illness

113
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:22,192
and we'll not dignify it
by speaking of it

114
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:25,458
unless absolutely necessary.
Is that clear to you?

115
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:27,160
Gotcha.

116
00:06:30,227 --> 00:06:32,866
You are such a stud.

117
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:35,975
That was interesting.

118
00:06:36,191 --> 00:06:38,102
So, Doctor Wen.

119
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:41,474
You asked Bonnie to assist you
with this Whipple procedure?

120
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:45,133
- Yes, I did.
- Thanks again, sir.

121
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:52,158
I guess we should just let it go.

122
00:06:52,332 --> 00:06:57,247
I mean, neither one of us wants to
do anything to make it worse, right?

123
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,785
You guys ever notice
how you're both Asian?

124
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:07,893
Your mother's maiden name is Turner.

125
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:12,967
So you used your key to get
into my personnel file. Big deal.

126
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,068
Your first kiss was with Sarah Briggs

127
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:18,946
at the embarrassing age of 16.

128
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:20,709
She wore a green turtleneck.

129
00:07:20,861 --> 00:07:25,252
You wonder sometimes if she still
thinks about you. I'm guessing no.

130
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:29,650
- How could you possibly know that?
- I'm your father.

131
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:40,566
Good morning, Dr Dorian.

132
00:07:40,714 --> 00:07:45,344
You probably don't notice it yourself,
but this hospital is a freak show.

133
00:07:45,636 --> 00:07:47,069
This is my band.

134
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:51,180
We're all working from different
departments in the hospital.

135
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:53,310
- <i>Legal</i>
- <i>Accounting</i>

136
00:07:53,477 --> 00:07:56,116
- <i>Shipping and Receiving</i>
- <i>Online Property Management</i>

137
00:07:56,313 --> 00:07:58,588
<i>Including Pest Control</i>
<i>Night Time Security</i>

138
00:07:58,774 --> 00:08:01,004
<i>And Non-Arboreal</i>
<i>Gardening Services</i>

139
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,208
That's... That's just great.

140
00:08:05,364 --> 00:08:09,243
We mostly do a cappella versions
of cartoon theme songs.

141
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:30,639
Dr Reid, I hope
I wasn't too harsh on you

142
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:33,362
- at rounds this morning.
- Oh, it's OK, sir.

143
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,754
I don't hate myself much
more than usual.

144
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:40,691
Well, turnabout's fair play, and all
that, so here's an evaluation form.

145
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:44,419
I figured I'd try to get a read
on how all you interns think I'm doing.

146
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:46,530
Don't sign your name.

147
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:50,212
It's completely anonymous,
and Dr Reid, I'm no she-doc.

148
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:52,521
I can take it.

149
00:08:55,706 --> 00:08:58,300
- You're going to crush him, right?
- Oh, yes.

150
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,934
- How do you spell ''inadequate''?
- Give me that.

151
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:03,164
I'll fill it out for you.

152
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:06,172
So, Mr Sullivan,
your blast percentage

153
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:09,500
is quite a bit higher than we
all expected. Around 80 percent.

154
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,998
That's bad, right? You want the number
to be low, huh? Like in golf?

155
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:18,020
Yes, exactly.
Like in golf. Do you play?

156
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,909
Oh, who the hell cares
if he plays golf?

157
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:22,380
I was bonding.

158
00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:24,162
You're doing a good job too.

159
00:09:24,318 --> 00:09:25,671
Oh, thanks.

160
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:27,218
Who is this clown?

161
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:29,957
Paul here is the best
oncologist in the room,

162
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:32,717
so why don't we all
just clam up and listen.

163
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,505
- We need to start chemo.
- When?

164
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:38,260
This afternoon.

165
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,218
I'm afraid this afternoon
doesn't work for me.

166
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,614
Ironically, I have
a golf game to get to.

167
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:47,709
Benji, don't sweat it.
Come on, give me a break.

168
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:49,199
You gonna be there?

169
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:52,141
I've got a thousand patients
to look after, so no,

170
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:54,940
I'll probably miss this
first one, but I will leave

171
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,496
my lovely and talented
assistant, Kimmy, OK?

172
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:02,155
Yeah, sure, you know, OK.

173
00:10:02,356 --> 00:10:05,268
- Oh, am I Kimmy?
- No, I'm Kimmy.

174
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:07,714
Oh! Good.

175
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,895
Carla torched Dr Kelso for me.

176
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:19,628
No matter what I wrote, I always
brought it back to sexual inadequacy.

177
00:10:20,582 --> 00:10:22,732
- So good.
- Hello, ladies.

178
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:24,590
- Hey, Doug.
- Hey, Doug.

179
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:26,869
What did you write
on Kelso's evaluation?

180
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:29,481
- What evaluation?
- You didn't get yours yet?

181
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:31,427
Nobody got one.

182
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:38,104
<i>Around here, bad behaviour</i>
<i>comes back to haunt you.</i>

183
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:40,378
Dr Wen, I want
to take this opportunity

184
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:45,077
to once again apologise to you
and the entire Asian community.

185
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:48,155
I'll pass it on
at the next big meeting.

186
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,634
You know, Christopher,

187
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:54,056
surgeons don't have to be
shallow, rank-obsessed clichés.

188
00:10:54,324 --> 00:10:56,633
So who's the best surgical intern?

189
00:10:56,827 --> 00:11:01,696
Is it Bonnie? Is it me?
Come on, I just, I gotta know.

190
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:06,948
The periampullary carcinoma patient
had a failed stenting of the bile duct.

191
00:11:07,254 --> 00:11:10,883
I wanna prep him for a pylorus
sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy.

192
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,646
Thanks.

193
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:16,589
Wassup, T-Man!
Show the Todd some love.

194
00:11:21,143 --> 00:11:23,338
Ben seemed
pretty down after you left,

195
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,750
so I could cover
and you could hang out.

196
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:27,930
You're a lamb,
but you don't have to.

197
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:30,383
- I don't mind. It's...
- Newbie, stop.

198
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:34,403
<i>It's funny how people</i>
<i>handle bad news in different ways.</i>

199
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:39,909
<i>Some people have</i>
<i>a visceral reaction.</i>

200
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:45,618
Time to get my soapy-soap on.

201
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,506
<i>Some people go into denial.</i>

202
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,183
No way.

203
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:51,090
<i>And others...</i>

204
00:11:51,256 --> 00:11:54,692
What chance do you give a guy
with Ben's blast percentage? Huh?

205
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:57,122
Twenty percent?
Thirty...maybe?

206
00:11:57,304 --> 00:11:59,738
You see, I can't handle that.
I cannot.

207
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:03,814
So, no thank you there, Johnny.

208
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:08,991
<i>Others just walk away.</i>

209
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:14,738
<i>Chemotherapy looks harmless,</i>

210
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:17,499
<i>but it's poison pumped</i>
<i>directly into your veins.</i>

211
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,134
Every time I got
sick when I was a little kid,

212
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:23,319
- Mom would get me a Tonka truck.
- Yeah, so?

213
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:25,575
So where's my Tonka truck?

214
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:32,120
- Score.
- The earth-mover. Can I see?

215
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,332
Ah, see it with your eyes, man,
not with your hands. See?

216
00:12:36,593 --> 00:12:38,982
I can't believe Perry
bailed on you. Typical.

217
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,898
He's always out the door
if things get too real.

218
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:45,026
<i>This is the true story.</i>

219
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:47,141
True story!

220
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:50,429
<i>Of four people,</i>
<i>forced to hang out in a hospital.</i>

221
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:53,561
<i>To find out what happens</i>
<i>when people stop being polite...</i>

222
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:56,337
<i>And start being real.</i>

223
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:03,446
- He didn't bail.
- If he did, he's a total wuss.

224
00:13:12,254 --> 00:13:15,052
You said you were giving
evaluations to all the interns.

225
00:13:15,257 --> 00:13:17,054
Well, not all at once, sweetheart.

226
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:20,368
With your way there'd be no
accountability. No back and forth.

227
00:13:20,596 --> 00:13:23,872
You wouldn't have to
explain to me why, let's see...

228
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:25,930
...''I'm most likely frustrated

229
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:29,491
because I haven't gotten any
since the Bay of Pigs.''

230
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,608
Oh, sir, I'm so sorry.

231
00:13:32,816 --> 00:13:34,613
Are we cool?

232
00:13:34,777 --> 00:13:37,655
What could have
possessed you to write such filth?

233
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:39,774
I need to tell you something...

234
00:13:39,948 --> 00:13:43,577
No, that's OK, Carla,
I'm gonna take care of that patient.

235
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:48,143
Dr Kelso, I did it because I didn't
think that you'd know it was me

236
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,490
and I thought that it would be funny.

237
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:52,579
Let's take a walk.

238
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:57,827
I'd like to tell you a few things
that I think are funny.

239
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:05,531
Oh, come on, how could
this guy be the best?

240
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:08,280
You want to know
the difference between you?

241
00:14:08,477 --> 00:14:11,753
When you're working I can
always see your wheels turning.

242
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,653
You're thinking about what to do next,
what could go wrong.

243
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:16,086
You're not in the moment.

244
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:21,229
And as much as it pains me
to say this, the Todd is.

245
00:14:21,532 --> 00:14:24,649
<i>Please. Just because I'm thorough</i>

246
00:14:24,868 --> 00:14:26,984
<i>and want to keep two</i>
<i>Kelly clamps on</i>

247
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:29,835
<i>in case the appendiceal artery</i>
<i>is inadvertently incised</i>

248
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,273
<i>so I can gain immediate haemostatic</i>
<i>control doesn't mean I think too much.</i>

249
00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:37,498
<i>Shiny scalpel</i>

250
00:14:37,673 --> 00:14:41,143
<i>Dum de de dum, de de dum</i>
<i>De de dum, gonna slice him up</i>

251
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:45,646
- You're afraid of escalators.
- That's not uncommon.

252
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:47,839
You like feel of cashmere
on your skin.

253
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:51,009
- How are you doing this?
- That's right, you run away!

254
00:14:51,228 --> 00:14:53,742
Run away from the truth!

255
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:56,737
Look, Dr Cox, I've been
doing a lot of thinking,

256
00:14:56,942 --> 00:15:01,458
and I think the only reason you're
not down at that hospital right now

257
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:03,730
is that you're afraid.

258
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:07,900
I think you're right. I do.

259
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:12,280
That's partly because you've
really gotten to know me this year,

260
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:16,295
but mostly it's because, well...

261
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:18,820
...I told you that
I was afraid earlier.

262
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:21,759
Don't tell me you've come here
to reiterate things

263
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:25,084
I've already said, because
I know the things that I've said.

264
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:29,183
In fact, I'm the one who said them.

265
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:32,266
You've got to get back
in the game, Coxie.

266
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:35,515
''Coxie'' was a mistake.
Pretend I didn't say Coxie.

267
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:37,084
Get out.

268
00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:40,827
Look, I... It boggles my mind
that you would just bail on a patient.

269
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,345
A patient is a stranger in a bed

270
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,169
that you can distance yourself
from when you need to.

271
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:50,076
Ben is my friend.

272
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,287
I'm gonna try to visit him
over the next couple of weeks,

273
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:57,856
but if I can't,
then that'll be very sad for me,

274
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:02,679
but really,
it'll just mean that I'm human.

275
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:06,038
Oh, and newbie,

276
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:10,220
please don't think that you've
come here because Ben needs me.

277
00:16:10,474 --> 00:16:12,271
You're here because
you're scared

278
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:15,585
that you might have to rely
on yourself for the first time.

279
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:17,405
And that...

280
00:16:17,564 --> 00:16:22,433
That is just the
saddest thing of all.

281
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:32,728
<i>I think one of the most universal</i>
<i>human experiences is feeling alone.</i>

282
00:16:32,996 --> 00:16:35,669
<i>You'd never know,</i>
<i>but there's tons of people</i>

283
00:16:35,874 --> 00:16:38,832
<i>feeling the exact same way.</i>

284
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:42,559
<i>Maybe because you're</i>
<i>feeling completely abandoned.</i>

285
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:47,428
<i>Maybe you realised that you aren't</i>
<i>as self-sufficient as you thought.</i>

286
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,951
<i>Maybe you know you should've</i>
<i>handled something differently.</i>

287
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:53,854
<i>Or maybe you aren't</i>
<i>as good as you thought you were.</i>

288
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:56,778
<i>Either way, when you hit</i>
<i>that low point, you have a choice.</i>

289
00:16:56,979 --> 00:17:01,450
<i>You can either wallow</i>
<i>in self-pity or you can suck it up.</i>

290
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:05,176
<i>It's your call.</i>

291
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:10,387
You know what, Dr Wen? I don't care
if I'm not the best right now,

292
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:12,972
because I'm all about the upside,
and one day,

293
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:16,154
I'm going to own this place.
That's right. All of this here,

294
00:17:16,373 --> 00:17:17,852
all of this right here

295
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,672
is gonna be
the Chris Turk Wing.

296
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:31,897
Dr Kelso, I wrote that evaluation.
It was me. Elliot didn't write a word.

297
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:35,301
But I would've written every word
if I'd had the courage...

298
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:38,589
...and the other-side-of-the-tracks
upbringing Carla did.

299
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:41,610
- You want to know what I think of you?
- You tell him.

300
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:47,677
You're mean.

301
00:17:47,821 --> 00:17:52,576
<i>As for me, I decided</i>
<i>that if Dr Cox couldn't do it,</i>

302
00:17:52,868 --> 00:17:55,462
<i>well then, I would have</i>
<i>to be the one there for Ben.</i>

303
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:29,777
- Oh, thank God.
- Goodbye, newbie.

304
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:34,743
So, you know, what's up?

305
00:18:35,035 --> 00:18:38,027
You know, this and that.
Hey, I met someone.

306
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:39,885
- Really?
- Yeah.

307
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,396
But she took a stool sample
so I think she works here.

308
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:47,461
Redhead? Tall?

309
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:51,185
- Not on the staff, no.
- No?

310
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:53,258
What a strange young lady.

311
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:55,147
Are we just gonna sit around here

312
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:58,502
and make jokes the rest of the day?
Is that the drill?

313
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:03,880
Listen, if it makes you uncomfortable,
then you can just bolt again.

314
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:07,181
I think it's only fair you hear
my end of the story there.

315
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:09,551
All right, fine.

316
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:19,171
Aw, man, I love you,

317
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:22,363
but you're a complete wuss.

318
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,620
I guess I got a little scared.

319
00:19:25,836 --> 00:19:28,225
Well, let me know
if there's anything I can do

320
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:30,617
to help you through this rough patch.

321
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,757
Give me a break. I'm not
good at this stuff. You know that.

322
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:36,927
- It's OK.
- I don't like the big conversations.

323
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:38,857
It's cool.

324
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:47,122
I've been thinking
about death a lot lately.

325
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:50,274
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

326
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:53,444
You think it's like New York,
you know...

327
00:19:53,655 --> 00:19:56,806
<i>To most people it might</i>
<i>have seemed like nothing had changed.</i>

328
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,821
Well, Dr Murphy?

329
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:08,204
- <i>But it had a little.</i>
- Go on.

330
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,980
Could it be lupus?

331
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:14,760
Good job, sport.

332
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:32,577
<i>As for Ben, he actually responded</i>
<i>to the chemo and went into remission.</i>

333
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:35,659
<i>Hopefully he won't be back,</i>
<i>but who knows?</i>

334
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:38,617
<i>Still, that's not</i>
<i>what this story's about.</i>

335
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:41,624
<i>It's about the day I realised</i>
<i>that admitting we're not heroic</i>

336
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:44,297
<i>is when we're</i>
<i>the most heroic of all.</i>

337
00:20:58,345 --> 00:21:00,939
<i>I guess he'll always...</i>

338
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,530
<i>...be a hero to me.</i>

339
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:27,283
''Always be a hero to me.''

340
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:29,251
What a girl!

341
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:31,010
What else we got?

342
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:34,946
Theatre camp.

343
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:37,009
Bingo.

344
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
