1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,900
it's not gonna be a problem.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,700
i didn't let kimmie get to me
in high school.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,000
- i won't let her get to me here.
- i'm just saying, she used you.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,100
i always knew
she was the same old...

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,000
rhymes with ba-zitch.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,800
okay, lil' hilda.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,700
i was naive
to trust kimmie keegan.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,800
- but what can i do about it now? nothing. 
- you can make sure

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,700
that she's not putting
a steak knife in your back.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,900
but it's not a competition,
and you know what?

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,400
we're both gonna be so busy,

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,500
we probably will never
run into each other.

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,200
it's, like, time
to make a decision already.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,800
i mean, it's not my fault
i wear clothes so well, right?

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,700
- what can i do?
- kimmie?

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,400
oh, this is nika and fiorina.
they're just getting me ready.

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
and you are at my desk
because?

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,700
i'm just getting ready for lunch
with talia from french "vogue."

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,800
we're discussing a benefit
to save the llamas.

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,800
- we'll be done soon.
- daniel.

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,200
- daniel. 
- good morning, betty. good morning, kimmie.

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,000
i ran into beau flynn
at marquee.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,500
- he has a film at sundance.
- uh, your plumber called.

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,800
- he wants to do a party, and i said "mode" would 
cosponsor. - there is a clog. he wants 
to shut off your water.

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,800
okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
first things first. betty.

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
thank you, daniel.

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,100
- i have a lot to go over with you. 
- like what?

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
thplumber.

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,900
maybe just that for now.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
okay. then how about food?
i'm gonna need breakfast

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,700
if we're planning
a major sundance blowout.

32
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,000
- huge news, kimmie.
- i'm feeling ya, brah.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,700
- come on. let's go make it happen. 
- oh, is there any chance

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,700
- i could get a little brekkie, too? 
i famished. - yeah, sure. betty, do you mind

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,100
getting a little something
for kimmie, too? thanks.

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,800
yeah, i'd be happy to.

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,900
there it is. breakfast.

38
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,900
thanks. i'll let you know
if i need anything else.

39
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,400
actually, you know,
if you do need something else,

40
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,800
you should probably...
do it yourself.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,900
i was happy to get you breakfast
because daniel asked me to,

42
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,400
but i work for daniel.

43
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,400
whatever. just remember,
i'm an editor now.

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,800
see? kimberly keegan,
associate editor.

45
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,000
taste that.

46
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,000
mode a meade publication
kimberly keegan associate editor
100 meade plaza south, new york ny 10016

47
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,300
well, we have, like, a thousand
associate editors, you know.

48
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,900
what's your title?
what your card say?

49
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,700
i don't have a card.

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,100
oh, right.

51
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,800
that's because
you're an assistant. darn.

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,500
editor...
assistant to editor.

53
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,600
editor... assistant.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,700
in just two weeks,

55
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,900
i've gotten higher
than you have in two years.

56
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,500
you know, i just wonder
if you're gonna be

57
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,600
an assistant
for the rest of your life.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,500
oh, and you can keep the card.
i have plenty.

59
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,600
the magazine industry
is getting hit hard.

60
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,200
i know i'm-i'm
just an accountant,

61
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
but budgets are
a lot like fashion-

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,000
- you'd rather not see red. 
- very funny. uh, perhaps you can wrap this up.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,800
- i have a meeting with tom ford.
- yeah, this was great, mort. thanks.

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,100
you two, stop.

65
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,700
i may not be an owner
of this company,

66
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,000
but my last name
is on this building,

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,700
- and i am telling you to wake up. 
- mom, we got it covered.

68
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,600
i don't think you do.
now alexis may have had

69
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,400
the occasional
murderous impulse,

70
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,000
but she also had
a keen mind for numbers,

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,100
which you two do not.

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,200
you need to bring in
someone to run this business.

73
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,000
dear claire,
setting us straight

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,900
like a poor man's sally field.

75
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,700
neither i nor daniel
cobbled our power together

76
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,200
with the intention
of giving it away.

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,000
i'm not talking about
giving anything away.

78
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,600
i'm talking about a c.f.o.,
a managing director,

79
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,800
someone who reports
directly to you.

80
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,300
mort, enlighten my friends.

81
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,100
please give them an honest
assessment of our finances.

82
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,200
if we keep going
the way we're going,

83
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,100
before you know it,
you two will go

84
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,200
from being the owners of meade

85
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,600
to the owners of nothing.

86
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,200
you look like you could use
a little help there.

87
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,900
- oh. hi, jesse.
- let me get a couple of those.

88
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,300
oh, no, no, no, no.
don't worry about me. i'm fine.

89
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,000
seriously, hand 'em over.

90
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,100
my parents taught me
to be polite.

91
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,700
- well, thank you.
- sure.

92
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,300
so, uh,
what's the guitar for?

93
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,500
got a gig?
am i using that word correctly?

94
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,600
yeah. it's an open mike night
at some coffee shop.

95
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,700
i'll probably get booed.

96
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,700
- no, no.
- nah, maybe not.

97
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,800
you know, last week, some dude
read ten pages of his journal

98
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,500
and then ended with a harmonica solo, 
and they liked him, so...

99
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,800
you'll be fine.

100
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,900
so how goes the, uh, fast-paced
life of a magazine editor?

101
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,300
oh, i'm not an editor.

102
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,400
i mean, i want to be,

103
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,800
- but for now i'm just an assistant. 
- oh.

104
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,500
- i don't even have business cards yet. 
- i hear that.

105
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,400
- it's like, what does it take to
get noticed in this town? 
- right?

106
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,200
- yeah. 
- i mean, i feel like
everybody else is getting chances

107
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,400
- while i sit around and grab people breakfast.
- you know, super b., you strike me as a dreamer.

108
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
well, yeah.
i mean, i guess i am.

109
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,200
oh, me, too. that's why
i tell myself every day,

110
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,600
"don't give in to the doubt."

111
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,500
and if you want something,
you gotta go for it.

112
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,300
- * go for it, betty *
- um, what are you doing?

113
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,000
i'm serenading you with advice.
isn't it obvious?

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,700
* go for it, betty,
no need to get sweaty *

115
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,100
* just go for it, betty *

116
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,600
* i know that you're ready *

117
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,700
* yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah *

118
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,600
tell me more.

119
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,600
so i was leaving

120
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,400
and the manager's like,
"are you kimmie from 'mode'?"

121
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,600
and i was like, "yeah,"
'cause i am, and he says,

122
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,900
"come back tomorrow. it's gonna
be bumpin'." i say, "why?"

123
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,200
he goes, "are you down
with young jeezy?"

124
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,600
- i was like, "am i down with young jeezy?" 
- hey, kimmie.

125
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,900
- hey, sexy. 
- busy, busy. let's talk later, okay?

126
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,200
- so then i ran into jade fmpton from "elle"... 
- did she just give us

127
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
the "busy, busy.
let's talk later" blowoff?

128
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,100
- we invented that blowoff. 
- yes, we did, to remind the 
little people around here

129
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,900
that we e king and queen
of this particular prom.

130
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,000
and now kimmie's
turning it on us.

131
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,400
i don't like it when the masses
get ideas, marc.

132
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,800

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
that will increase brain power
or reduce stress,

166
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,600
something they can keep in their
desk and pop in their mouth

167
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,200
to get an edge in today's
hyper-competitive world.

168
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,300
<i>the sizzling hot fruit.</i>

169
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,000
this is the first time
i get to vote. the first time.

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,900
<i>papi, last year
you voted five times</i>

171
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,600
on "dancing with the stars."

172
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,100
only because
that kristi yamaguchi

173
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,800
is an asian ball of fire,
but this is for the president.

174
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,400
i've dreamt about it
for a long time.

175
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,100
well, you're not the only one
who's excited

176
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,000
about the election.
got big plans.

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,500
- what?
- to promote my shop.

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,800
yeah, the polls are
right around the corner,

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
and justin is
gonna hand out flyers,

180
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
- dressed in a red,
white and blue suit. 
- no.

181
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,200
i think
it's gonna be a really big day

182
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,500
for hilda's beautilities.

183
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,300
- and for democracy.
- i got a job!

184
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,600
<i>ay, betty, i left mexico</i>

185
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
so my family wouldn't have
to sell fruit on the street.

186
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,800
no, i get to choose this
winter's sizzling hot fruit.

187
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,900
it's a quarter page in "mode"
with a picture,

188
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,300
and i'm in charge.

189
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,900
i'm in charge.

190
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,900
mmm. i like the carambola.

191
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,800
unh. so five minutes ago.

192
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,900
you're right.
it was everywhere last winter.

193
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,100
<i>- what about the durian? 
- ay, no. this thing stinks. 
pass me the dragon's eye.</i>

194
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,000
don't bother.

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,500
the name is much more
interesting than the flavor.

196
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,100
- believe me.
- mmm. kiwi.

197
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,800
- ki-won't.
- you're right. that's boring.

198
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,900
i need to find something
dazzling, unpredictable.

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,300
it might be my only chance.

200
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,600
hang on. i got it.
the tico berry.

201
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,100
what? 
dad, i've never even heard of that.

202
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,700
it-it-it's brizilian,
very rare.

203
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,200
i learned about it
from this, um, busboy once.

204
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
interesting guy.

205
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,700
here it is.

206
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,900
<i>ay, papi,
that is one ugly berry.</i>

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,400
well, don't judge it
by the outside.

208
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,800
- find out what's inside.
- "succulent, flavorful,

209
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,000
rumored to have
special healing powers."

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
- hey. hmm?
- let me look this u

211
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,600
succulent and flavful-
reminds me of me.

212
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,300
mom, inappropriate.

213
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,000
well, there's not much here,

214
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
except something
on someone's blog.

215
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,200
hmm.

216
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,600
oh, my god.

217
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,000
what?

218
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,900
oh, my god.

219
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,400
what?!

220
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,100
all right, people,
listen up.

221
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,000
we have a very important
announcement.

222
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,900
daniel, she's your girl,
so go ahead.

223
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,300
betty has scored a giant coup
for the sizzling hot issue.

224
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,900
her choice for sizzling hot
fruit, the... tico berry.

225
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
ahem. is the beloved fruit
of supermodel adriana lima.

226
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,500
"growing up
as a young girl in brazil,

227
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,000
"adriana would spend the summers
on her grandfather's farm,

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,500
"where he grew tico berries.

229
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,000
"she ate them every day.

230
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
she creds them
for making her beautiful."

231
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
amanda, they don't have any
in the cafeteria.

232
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,400
it's not for me.
it's for my friend.

233
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,900
so la lima
has agreed to a cover

234
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,200
and a feature story for us.

235
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,200
this is big. adriana has
never done a "mode" cover,

236
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,300
so we're gonna cut
the sizzling hot budget,

237
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,600
go all-in on the shoot.

238
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,400
betty, it's yours.
run with it.

239
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,100
what-what do you mean?

240
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,400
you made it happen. we want you
to be the project manager.

241
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,800
really?

242
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,100
well,
that's initiative, people.

243
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,600
sometimes it comes
in unlikely brown packages.

244
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,700
thank you.

245
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,600
oh, sorry, kimmie.

246
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,800
we're gonna have to cut
the hot club. maybe next time.

247
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,600
wow. i'm so happy for you.
congratulations.

248
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,200
thanks. thank you.

249
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,400
game on, betty.

marc, the car is not here.
make it get here.

254
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,500
well, do something now.

255
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,800
aren't you
wilhelmina slater?

256
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,200
oh, dear lord.

257
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,600
i'm sorry to bug you.

258
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,700
i know you must hate this,
but i am such an admirer.

259
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,000
well, you're probably either gay
or a gossip.

260
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,200
neither, i'm afraid.
connor owens.

261
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,800
connor owens from crittenden?

262
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,700
formerly. just took
my stock options and ran.

263
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,300
you did
a nice job over there.

264
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,100
oh, a good book
always sells itself.

265
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,100
the trick is
marketing the brand.

266
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,300
- well, that's not happening for our company. 
- really? that's criminal.

267
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,600
any publisher in town would love
to have your titles.

268
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
uh, nice meeting you,
connor.

269
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,200
connor, would you have
any interest in coming to meade?

270
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,300
i don't think
that's gonna happen.

271
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
danny meade and i
don't quite get along.

272
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,600
really? how so?

273
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,900
oh, let's just say there's
a little bit of history there.

274
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,500
you take care, ms. slater.
it was great to meet you.

275
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
daniel, hey.

276
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,300
i was just wondering
if there's anything i can do

277
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,000
- to help out on the adriana lima shoot.
- uh, yeah. talk to betty.

278
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,700
suzuki,
always great to see you.

279
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,300
well, danny, we love a scoop
at "fashion buzz,"

280
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,600
and landing adriana lima for
the cover of your march issue

281
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,700
- is two scoops with whipped cream
and sprinkles. 
- well, the truth is,

282
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,500
it's my incredibly capable
assistant who made it happen.

283
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,500
- you should talk to her. 
- mm. little person does good. great angle.

284
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,700
where is this plucky lady
with a dream?

285
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,500
uh, betty? b-betty.

286
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,900
yes?

287
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,900
makeup.

288
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,700
okay, i can't stand
to see makeup done badly.

289
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,600
i was on tv once,
and i know how to do it.

290
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,000
- please let me help you.
- um, no, thank you. i'm fine.

291
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,800
no, you're not.

292
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,400
i mean, what you're doing is
seriously awful.

293
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,300
- well, maybe you and i have dif
- look, if you're gonna represent the magazine,

294
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,400
you have to look good.

295
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,400
okay, if it's impoant
to "mode," it's important to me.

296
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,400
- keep your eyes still.
- why? um, eyelashes?

297
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,800
trust me. people watching
at home go straight to the eyes.

298
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,500
i hate to say this,
but congratulations.

299
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
you know, you've done
a really good job

300
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,200
- with this whole adriana thing.
- wow. thank you.

301
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,300
so do you want to practice
what you're gonna say?

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,600
well,
i am a little nervous.

303
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,900
this unique cover

304
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,600
gives "mode"
a special opportunity

305
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,200
to show a new side of adriana.

306
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,300
one of her favorite sayings is,
"tico is life,"

307
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,900
so this incredible photographer
we've hired

308
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,400
is going to use
the tico berry

309
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,500
as a gateway to adriana's
childhood memories,

310
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,200
as in a surrealist painting.

311
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,400
i know that i'll be
the first in line

312
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,000
- when it cos out on the newsstands. 
- awesome.

313
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,600
i forgot
to tell my family

314
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,500
that i'm gonna be on tv.
i'll be back.

315
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
okay. we'll just finish
when you get back.

316
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,200
how do you guys lift
these lights?

317
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,000
- i mean, they look so heavy.
- i work out a lot.

318
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,100
yeah, i can tell.

319
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,900
so do you think this is gonna
be bright enough for tv?

320
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,600
yeah, we're good. any more,
and it might be too hot.

321
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,100
well, i don't think it's bad
if things get too hot, do you?

322
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
well...

323
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,200
<i>papi, the polls open
at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.</i>

324
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,600
you gotta be dressed.

325
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,900
can't have my clients see you
in your crazy old man pajamas.

326
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,400
you worry about yourself.
you're crabby in the morning.

327
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,400
i'm cute. justin!

328
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,000
what?

329
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,100
- ???
- i'm not wearing this.

330
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,300
sweetheart, that is so good.
who could rest that?

331
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,000
- anyone with taste?
- oh, come on.

332
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,700
you look great.

333
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,200
hello?

334
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,800
what?

335
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,100
aunt betty's
gonna be on television!

336
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,700
stylish people of "mode," could
we have a little quiet, please?

337
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:59,000
we go live in five, four...

338
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,800
this is suzuki st. pierre
with breaking news.

339
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,900
"mode" has scored adriana lima
for their sizzling hot issue,

340
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,800
and it's all the doing of
this young lady-betty suarez.

341
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,900
speak, betty.

342
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,000
um, well, suzuki,

343
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,700
i was researching our sizzling
hot fruit, the tico berry,

344
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,000
when i discovered

345
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,600
that adriana's grandfather
grows them on his farm.

346
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,400
farms.
we know what those are.

347
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,000
those are the things

348
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,800
fashion people knock down so
we can build our weekend houses.

349
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,700
tell us more, betty.

350
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,700
what other newsworthy crumbs
can you drop on the ground

351
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,000
for gossip-hungry
"fashion buzz" viewers, hmm?

352
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
- wow.
- she's doing so great.

353
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,500
- i bet you she gets her own show after this. 
- quiet. i want to hear what she says.

354
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,600
steamy brazil, was it?

355
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
well, suzuki, um...

356
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:51,000
this unique cover is
a great chance for "mode,"

357
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,600
um, to show...

358
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:02,600
um, show, a-a different side
of adriana.

359
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,800
not so, uh, old.

360
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,500
i mean, uh, not the same old-

361
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,500
- not the same old thing. 
- now, uh, does the tico berry go good with vodka?

362
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,000
would it make
a good tico-tini?

363
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
uh, her...

364
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,100
uh, her berries-
adriana's berries...

365
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,400
um, well, adriana's berries
have never been, um,

366
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,900
been seen before.

367
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:34,100
ooh. uh, sorry. sorry. um...

368
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,900
- holy crap.
- there goes her show.

369
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,600
what-you know what?

370
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,200
um, i'm sorry.
just o-one second.

371
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,300
suzuki, hi.

372
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,400
hi.

373
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,900
 as our girl adriana says,
"tico is life."

374
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,200
and when you see this cover,
you'll know why.

375
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,200
i know i'm gonna be
first in line at the newsstand

376
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,900
- the day it comes out. 
- well, you'll be right behind me, 'cause i can't wait.

377
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,200
you heard it first.
adriana lima in "mode,"

378
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,600
from kimmie keegan,
associate editor.

379
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,100
great work, kimmie keegan.
wonderful job.

380
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,100
betty, so, uh, everying you've done so far
to make this cover happen 
has been fantastic.

381
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,300
you're working very hard. you're
putting the pieces together.

382
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,500
ugh! just rip it off, daniel.

383
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,300
the tv spot was a disaster.

384
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,100
kimmie will work on the cover
with you to add a little polish.

385
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,300
any questions?

386
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,800
no questions.

387
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,300
i'm so thrilled about this.

388
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,100
- i'm really excited for us to be
working gether, betty. 
- moving on.

389
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,900
anyone's name who is not
on the masthead may leave.

390
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,000
you are unbelievable.

391
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,400
you sabotaged me.

392
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,500
uh, it's not my fault

393
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,600
you don't have the face
or pores for television.

394
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,700
no, you just couldn't stand
that i was in charge,

395
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,700
- so you had to weasel your way in there.
- i happen to like being in the spotlight,

396
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,300
and unfortunately, there's just
not room for the two of us.

397
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,300
<i>yeah, well, we have to work
as a team, so it'll have to be.</i>

398
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,000
- that's one way to look at it.
- and what's the other?

399
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,400
the shoot is in two days.

400
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,200
my bet is, is that
by the time it happens,

401
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,100
one of us will be gone,
and it's not gonna be me.

402
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,300
you know daniel, i was thinking
about what your mother said.

403
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,900
about hiring a c.f.o.?

404
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,900
well, i only know him
by reputation, but, uh,

405
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,200
- i heard that connor owens is an exceptional
- no.

406
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,300
well, he has the best business
mind this side of iger.

407
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,600
absolutely not

408
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,500
daniel, i-i thought
we had reached a place

409
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,700
where we could work together
on things.

410
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,500
isn't there a chance

411
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,900
you could put whatever silly
issues you have with him aside

412
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,900
and do what's best for meade?

413
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,700
daniel,
i'm so sorry to bother you,

414
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,100
but i really don't think
that i can work with kimmie.

415
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,200
why not?

416
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,800
well, i don't trust her,

417
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,100
and she brings out
this side of me

418
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,400
where i want
to scratch her eyes out.

419
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,100
betty...

420
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,600
do you think
i like working with wilhelmina?

421
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,800
well, no.

422
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,900
there isn't a day
that goes by

423
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
that i'm not fighting with her
about something.

424
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,100
like it or not,
she's my partner.

425
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,800
- we have this magazine to put out. - but
kimmie's trying to take my project from me.

426
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,100
- so don't let her.
- no, but she doesn't play fair.

427
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,300
that's her problem. you gotta
worry about yourself.

428
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,500
this is what you wished for,
right?

429
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,800
as you move up,
things aren't gonna get easier.

430
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,700
my advice to you-
be a professional.

431
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,200
take the high road.

432
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,300
and christina aguilera
walks in with her child,

433
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,900
and she's breast-feeding.

434
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,300
how did it happen?

435
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,000
we used to be the ones spreading
rumors, mocking coworkers,

436
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,500
ruining self-esteem,

437
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
because god made us pretty,
god made us mean.

438
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,100
sometimes he gives
with both hands.

439
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,400
but look around.
it is kimmie's world.

440
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,400
okay, but before we go nuclear
on her, we need more.

441
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,800
i agree. and you know me,
i hate going nuclear.

442
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,300
- you love going nuclear. - i do love going
nuclear, and destroying someone is fun.

443
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,500
oh, look. it's sad betty.

444
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,900
betty,
we need to talk to you.

445
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,700
there's a problem, something
that affects all of us,

446
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,400
<i>like global warning.</i>

447
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
it's kimmie,

448
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,800
and the inconvenient truth
is that she's evil,

449
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,700
- and she has to go.
- what do you mean, go?

450
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,100
- we need to kill her.
- get her fired.

451
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,100
- whatever.
- and we need your help.

452
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,200
she's working with you
on the shoot, right?

453
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
i don't know, guys.
getting someone fired...

454
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,800
- betty, she threatened your family. 
- what? when?

455
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,000
okay, she didn't do that,

456
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
but she did weasel her way
into your big moment, right?

457
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,300
yes.

458
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,100
it's not exactly
taking the high road.

459
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,400
betty, yes or no?

460
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,300
no.

461
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,700
people, behold.

462
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,600
this is a loulou de la falaise
reproduction

463
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,300
<i>of marie antoinette's
famous framboise necklace.</i>

464
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,900
poor girloved her berries.

465
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,100
betty, do you think
this might be a good idea

466
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,000
for the adriana lima shoot?

467
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,000
- maybe. yeah.
- it's just a suggestion.

468
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,300
it could be
the perfect complement

469
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,000
<i>- to that beautiful oscar
de la renta gown. 
- bom dia.</i>

470
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,700
<i>bom dia. adriana</i>

471
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,700
<i>- mwah. adriana. mwah. tudo bem?
- tudo bem.</i>

472
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,500
- hi. 
- i haven't seen you since milan. how you feeling?

473
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,800
i've been great except for
my broken finger.

474
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,900
you should see thether girl.
joking. joking.

475
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,600
but i'm really happy to be here

476
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,300
to do this photo shoot
with my beloved tico berries.

477
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,600
oh, we are just thrilled
to have you.

478
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,200
kimmie has been telling me all
her ideas for this photo shoot.

479
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,600
the theme of memory is genius.

480
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,400
uh, kimmie's ideas?

481
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,600
i don't know about genius,
but it could work.

482
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,000
and guess who we got
to shoot it?

483
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,700
phillipe loire. we saw him
at t club last night.

484
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,800
- cliff was supposed to shoot that cover. 
- that skank needs to be stopped.

485
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,100
- kimmie, what is going on? 
- oh, i saw in the schedule 
that you gave out

486
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,500
that adriana was landing
lastight,

487
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,300
so i met her at the airport
and introduced myself.

488
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,200
we hit it off,

489
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,400
so we went out for some dinner
and some drinks.

490
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,100
and then you told her
that my ideas were your ideas?

491
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,500
well, maybe you
should have done more

492
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,300
- than just send a fruit basket to her room. 
- adriana, hi.

493
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,400
- hi. 
- i'm betty suarez. nice to meet you.

494
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,200
- i work here. actually
- sorry, but we, um, we have to go.

495
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,700
sorry, guys. but, um, a. lim.,
it's spa time.

496
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,900
i'm sorry to interrupt.
i'll see everybody tomorrow.

497
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,200
and remember, tico is life.

498
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,400
don't worry about her.
she's just someone's assistant.

499
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,200
screw the high road.

500
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,500
i'm in.

501
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,300
let's kill kimmie.

502
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,700
it's a pleasure to be here.

503
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,300
daniel knows me from harvard,

504
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,000
but unlike
some people in this room,

505
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,400
i didn't grow up rich.

506
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,600
nobody ever gave me anything.

507
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,700
i grew up in a council flat
in sydney.

508
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,000
if that's where i end up,
fine by me.

509
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,700
is there a point
to this delightful mini bio?

510
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,900
- oh, daniel. 
- i never take a job for the money.

511
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
- ah. 
- when i ran accounts for beard & phelps

512
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,900
and a client
didn'tike our campaign,

513
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,700
i didn't take no
from some v.p. of marketing

514
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,700
who couldn't find his nuts
with a gps.

515
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,100
i went over the idiot's head
until i was standing in a room

516
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,700
with the person who had
the power to say yes,

517
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,000
and then
that person said yes.

518
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,100
because if i learned one thing
talking to my old man

519
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,400
on a prison phone
through a glass partition,

520
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,000
it's never take on
something you can't defend.

521
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,300
and i can defend this company.

522
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,200
but i won't lie to you.
there's work to do.

523
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,200
you need a new business plan.
here's what i'd do.

524
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,200
read it through.
it speaks for itself.

525
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,900
thanks for your time.

526
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,900
thank you.

527
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,600
daniel?

528
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,300
it's an odorless,
colorless gas.

529
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,100
when she wakes up, she's got
heroin stuffed in her pockets.

530
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,500
police come in, whisk her away,
problem solved.

531
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,600
- i don't know how i feel about sending 
her to prison. - yeah, i'm gonna have 
to go with betty on this one.

532
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,200
- too far, mandy. too far.
- i say she deserves

533
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,100
- whatever horrible punishment she gets. marc,
- your boyfriend's getting cheese on my couch.

534
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,600
cliff, napkin.

535
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,600
honey, i know you're upset
and anger-eating

536
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,400
because you lost
the adriana shoot,

537
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,700
but trust me,
kimmie will be dealt with.

538
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,500
it just has to be appropriate.

539
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,100
- do they still make guillotines? 
- not constructive.

540
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,300
- wait. that's it.
- marc, you're scaring me.

541
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,000
the marie antoinette necklace

542
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,100
- that wilhelmina wants to use in the shoot.
- yeah, but that was just a suggestion.

543
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,100
that was no suggestion. that was
vintage slater scheming.

544
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,600
that necklace
is up for auction,

545
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,200
and if a "mode" cover
spikes the price,

546
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,300
 wilhelmina gets a cut.

547
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,000
and if that necklace isn't
around adriana lima's neck...

548
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
then someone
will lose their head.

549
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
<i>ay, louisa,
you look beautiful.</i>

550
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,300
- and yohave your "i voted" sticker,
so you get 10% off. 
- all right.

551
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,200
- justin's outside. he'll
cash you out. 
- all right.

552
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,700
okay, thank you.
okay, who's next?

553
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,400
hi. come on in. come on in.
sit down.

554
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,700
okay, i'm thinking, like, um,
a sexy michelle obama

555
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,600
or maybe a stylish cindy mccain.

556
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,600
<i>oh, excuse me. mija?</i>

557
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,500
oh. ruminate on that. i'll
be right back. okay, good.

558
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,500
- sweetie, are you gonna take a break soon? 
- i got business out the wazoo.

559
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,700
<i>- but you haven't had a chance to vote yet.
- yeah, papi, i'll do it if i have time.</i>

560
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,100
<i>mija, do you realize how
important your vote is?</i>

561
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,800
<i>mija, you are an american.</i>

562
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,100
<i>ay, spare me
the civics lesson, okay?</i>

563
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
you know what's american?

564
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,100
making money.

565
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,400
i am not about to slow down

566
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,700
the best day of business
this salon has ever had

567
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,700
to vote on something
that i don't care about.

568
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,900
it's got nothing to do with me.
now i gotta go. i got business.

569
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,600
hi. sorry about that.
you know what i was thinking?

570
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,800
senator clinton.
it's a style that never quits.

571
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,200
all right, just make
sure everyone's okay over there,

572
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,400
- and then i'll
- o.m.g., kimmie. it looks amazing.

573
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,100
- you did such an awesome job. 
- thanks.

574
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,700
i love how those things

575
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,600
- look like they're free-floating in
the air. - oh, yeah. it's suri-realism.

576
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,800
- it's this thing tom cruise's
daughter invented. 
- oh.

577
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,400
oh, but what is that thing

578
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,200
on adriana's stand-in's neck?
ew. marc, check that out.

579
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,700
ugh. it is awful!

580
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,100
it's a giant piece of fruit.

581
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,700
what, did it fall off
of carmen miranda's hat?

582
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,900
- oh, or is the theme berries?
- oh.

583
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,400
tico berries, strawberries.

584
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
- what about blueberry?
- or a halle berry?

585
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,000
this was betty's idea,
wasn't it?

586
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,400
it was totally betty's idea, 'cause it
sucks. 

587
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,400
do you really think it's that bad?

588
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,100
- the worst.
- beyond.

589
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,100
i don't know.

590
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
yeah, it blows.

591
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,700
could someone please lose
that necklace a-sap?

592
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,600
get it off her neck.
it's hurting my eyes.

593
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,200
okay, come on.
we don't have all day.

594
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,300
- we set her up, betty.
- you knock her down.

595
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,400
since you haven't
said anything,

596
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,200
i assume it's a no go
on hiring connor?

597
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,100
fine. i'll give him a call,

598
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,200
tell him we didn't think
he was the right fit.

599
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
i'll talk.

600
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,300
hi, daniel meade
for connor owens.

601
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,200
connor, daniel meade here.

602
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,700
i'm sitting
with wilhelmina slater.

603
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,100
so how'd you like to come run
the business side of meade?

604
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,300
you'll have the offer in writing
tomorrow morning.

605
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,900
yeah.

606
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,900
you were right.
we need him.

607
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,600
well, thank you, daniel,

608
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,800
for putting your ego aside

609
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,900
and respecting me on this.

610
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,800
this is albacore, okay?
i don't eat albacore.

611
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,200
- now go back to nobu and get
me what i ordered. 
- hey, kimmie.

612
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,600
i was just wondering if you
needed me to do anything,

613
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,400
- you know, help out?
- no, i'm good.

614
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,600
gosh, i'm so nervous

615
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,900
you know, wilhelmina's
gonna be here any second.

616
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,200
- so? big deal.
- well, not for you,

617
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,400
because you're so good
at standing up for yourself,

618
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,700
but i'm not.

619
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,000
i mean, wilhelmina always has
such strong opinions,

620
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,100
- and i always back down.
- well, i'm sure she likes that.

621
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,200
no. no, she hates it.

622
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,000
she only respects people
who stand up to her.

623
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,400
really?

624
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,000
yeah. i mean,
she's gonna walk in here,

625
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,200
ask to change ten things,

626
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,500
but what she really wants
is for someone to say no.

627
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,200
i always say yes.
i just wish i wasn't so weak.

628
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,500
the only way to impress
wilhelmina is to be strong.

629
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,300
oh, well.

630
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,900
* if anybody wanted to know
* know

631
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,700
*how to party
and get on the floor *

632
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,100
- you made it happen, betty.
- ye, i did.

633
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
i'm proud of you.

634
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,400
you found a way
to make it work with kimmie.

635
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,700
oh, uh... yep, i did.

636
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,200
this business is tough.

637
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,400
it really makes you wonder,
what kind of person am i?

638
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,500
what am i willing to do
to get ahead?

639
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,800
it's not easy.

640
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,000
so how's everything going?

641
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,200
excuse me.

642
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,000
- kimmie, i have to talk to you right away. 
- bad time. adriana's due any minute.

643
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,300
- no. look, i may have steered you
in the wrong direction. 
- hey, betty.

644
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,600
- what are you doing? stop this.
- guys, i can't do it, okay?

645
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,400
- this isn't how i want to get ahead. 
- oh!

646
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,000
- we have to distract her. does
anyone have a 6-foot hoagie? 
- no. ooh.

647
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,800
all right, so i set you up.

648
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,500
wilhelmina hates it
when people disagree with her,

649
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,200
so whatever she says,
just do it.

650
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,700
what? just back down
and look weak? no, thanks.

651
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,100
unlike you, betty,
i intend to go places.

652
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,500
no, but that's
what she wants.

653
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,100
- she wants you to be weak. she wants
everybody to be weak. - you're so transparent.

654
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,900
no, i am being honest.
look, she really, really wants

655
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,400
that necklace in the shoot,
so just put it back.

656
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,400
- necklace! 
- unbelievable. now you're trying to set me up

657
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,400
to put that ugly necklace
back on the model.

658
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,100
no, i was setting you up before.
i am not now. i swear.

659
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,600
look, betty, i know
how to judge character,

660
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,400
and right now you're oozing
petty, bitter, jealous ooze.

661
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,900
- it's all over you. i see right through
your stupid little plan. - kimmie.

662
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,200
so, uh, where is the necklace?

663
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,000
it's not going to be in the shoot.

664
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,100
- but i want it in the shoot. 
- yeah, but it's hideous, so we're not using it.

665
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,000
now don't worry, babe.
i got it covered.

666
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,900
just sit back, relax,
have a doughnut.

667
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:46,300
- do you have some kind of death wish? 
- my only wish right now is that you 
scooty scoot scoot.

668
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,900
go on. find someplace shady.

669
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,300
get the damn necklace
and put it in the damn picture.

670
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,900
- here. 
- it's not going to be in the picture.

671
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,000
- that's my decision, and that's final. 
- well, you're fired.

672
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,300
- no, i'm not fired.
- oh, yes, you are fired.

673
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,600
but-but...

674
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,400
wait a minute.
they tricked me.

675
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,400
that's not fair. i have worked
too hard to get here.

676
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,800
this is my jumping off point.
what about my blog, my vlog,

677
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,100
- my perfume, my fashion line?
- security, come get her, please.

678
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
nuh-uh. this is not
how it's going down.

679
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,300
no kimmie, no shoot.
how about that?

680
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,600
- excuse me? 
- have fun doing a tico
berry shoot with no tico berries.

681
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
no. no, kimmie! don't.

682
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,000
please don't.
that's all we have!

683
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,300
- this way, miss. 
- what are you doing? get off of me.

684
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,300
- come on, now. 
- screw all of you!
you haven't seen the last of me!

685
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,500
what?

686
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,400
adriana lima's arriving.

687
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,500
i'm here and ready to go.

688
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,800
where are my tico berries?

689
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,700
betty?

690
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,600
oh. too late for a haircut?

691
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,600
no. no, no, no. not at all.
come on in. have a seat.

692
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,000
i saw one of your flyers
over at voting,

693
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,500
- and i thought i'd, uh, pop on in. 
- oh, great. how do you like it?

694
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,300
oh, just-just clean it up
a little bit.

695
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,200
i have this work thing later,

696
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,900
- and i want to look, you
know, sharp. - no problem.

697
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,200
i had no idea
this little salon

698
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,300
was right here
in the neighborhood.

699
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,400
- i love it. it's great for the community. - yeah,
we don't get a lot of foot traffic, you know.

700
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,300
it's not like this is a business district. you
have a hard time getting a business license?

701
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,800
nah. i didn't get one.
what's the big deal, right?

702
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,200
well, they could hit you
with a pretty big fine,

703
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,600
- shut you down. - yeah, but
who's gonnsay anything?

704
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,000
maybe no one, but, uh,

705
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,500
it's always better to be safe
with these things. trust me.

706
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,000
i'm a councilman
in this district.

707
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,200
so you're here to bust me?

708
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,000
uh, no. actually,
i just really needed a haircut.

709
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,100
- well, now you're not getting one. - i'm
just telling you the law. it's my job.

710
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,800
- get out. - but you only
finished half my hair.

711
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,400
all right, look.

712
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
why don't you take my card?

713
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,400
and i promise, i'll do
anything i can to help you.

714
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,100
but i strongly suggest
you shut down temporarily

715
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,600
- until you get that license.
- "archie rodriguez"?

716
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,500
 that's me.

717
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,600
well, archie rodriguez,
i have six weeks of bookings,

718
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,500
and now you're telling me
that i can't run my own salon?

719
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
what can i say?

720
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,400
next time
you could vote me out.

721
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,100
betty, do something.
are there any more berries?

722
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,300
- they weren't very easy to find. 
- well, adriana's not doing the shoot 
without those berries.

723
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,200
if this falls apart,
it's a major fiasco.

724
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,600
- the press will kill us. 
- hello? i'm waiting for my beautiful berries.

725
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,100
uh, they'll be here
in a minute, adriana.

726
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,300
we can't bluff for too long.

727
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,500
you know what they say
about models,

728
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,700
- but this one is a smart one. 
- done. anybody have the sunday 
"times" crossword?

729
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,900
we have a lot riding on this.

730
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,200
are you sure you don't want me
to take over?

731
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,300
no. uh, no. um...

732
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,200
i just remembered something.

733
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,300
adriana, hi.

734
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,300
hi.

735
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
i'm betty suarez.
i work at "mode."

736
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,700
- nice to meet you.
- uh, adriana,

737
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,900
did you get that fruit basket
we put in your room?

738
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,000
yes, i did.

739
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
it was wonderful.
thank you so much.

740
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,700
oh, good. uh...

741
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,700
see, 'cause i know i put
some tico berries in there,

742
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,100
and it would be great
if you didn't eat all of them,

743
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,000
because, you see, we don't have
any tico berries for the shoot.

744
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,300
i don't understand.

745
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,700
this whole shoot
was inspired by the berries.

746
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,900
i know, i know,
and we had them.

747
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,600
it's just, there was
an incident, and now we don't.

748
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,200
and it's not like it's exactly
easy to come by them.

749
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,400
i mean, this isn't
todos os santos bay.

750
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,100
- how do you know that? 
- well, it's where your grandfather's 
farm is, right?

751
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,200
- yes.
- i did the research.

752
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,000
kimmie told me
she did all the work.

753
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,800
yeah.

754
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,500
okay. i get it.

755
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,800
she's that type of girl.

756
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,700
well, it's not exactly like
my way's any better.

757
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,100
we don't have the berries.

758
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,400
so...
did you eat all of them?

759
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,300
i gotta say, you really
pulled it off, betty.

760
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,300
congratulations.

761
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,400
thank you, daniel.

762
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,000
and i owe you an apology
about kimmie.

763
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,700
she was a bad seed.
i didn't see it.

764
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,500
oh, well. you were right.

765
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,100
the thing that's important
is how i do my job.

766
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,300
oh, uh, speaking
of the business,

767
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,200
i got you something i thought
you might be able to use.

768
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,000
- what?
- hello, daniel.

769
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,000
connor.

770
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,600
- this is my assistant betty sua
- betty suarez. hi.

771
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,200
you're connor owens.

772
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,900
oh, my god. you're, like,
famous in the publishing world.

773
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,600
and you've got a good handshake.
firm, strong big hands-

774
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,300
- really big, like tennis racquets
with fingers. - ahem. betty.

775
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,200
- sorry.
- it's nice to meet you.

776
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,700
- so did that offer come in? - yes, it did,
and i'd like to talk about it with you.

777
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,800
betty, would you excuse us
for a second?

778
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,900
we did it.

779
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,300
so now it's real.

780
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
that was smooth.

781
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,800
and wilhelmina has no idea.

782
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,200
looks like somebody
had a good day.

783
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,600
yes. today was a good day.

784
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,000
- what you holding on to
so tight? - oh, nothing.

785
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,700
just something my boss gave me
for doing a photo shoot.

786
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,500
oh. so you got your chance.

787
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:32,100
uh, yeah, mainly because you
told me to go for it.

788
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,100
oh, well, i was just telling you
what i tell myself.

789
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,600
 well, it worked,
so thank you.

790
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,600
sure.
so let me see what you got.

791
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,900
business cards.

792
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,900

but i'll get there.

793
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,600
and you can keep that one.
