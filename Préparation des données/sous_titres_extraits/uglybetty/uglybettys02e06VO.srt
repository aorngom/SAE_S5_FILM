1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
<I>Previously On "Ugly Betty"...</I>

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,900
I Just Got Fired Because
<I>You</I> Went Crying To Your Boss.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,800
You're Late.
Take Off Your Clothes.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,600
Ha Ha. Easy, Sailor.
Buy A Girl A Drink First

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,700
If You Had Told Me
That I Would End Up

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,400
At Your Apartment,
I Would Not Have Believed You.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,300
The Bradford Meade-
Wilhelmina Slater Weddin

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,900
Is Back On.

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,400
I Lost Atlantic Attire.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,800
He Was Protectinme.
Don't Defend Him.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,300
I Know You're Leaving
In Five Months,

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,000
And I Know That I'm
Gonna Get My Heart Broken,

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But Maybe It's Worth It,

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,600
As Long As We Keep
Our Relationship Secret.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,700
Hey.

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,500
I'm Not Going Anywhere!

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,500
Hurry, <I>Mija,</I> Into The Kitchen.
Betty, Come On.

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,400
What Are We Doing?
This Was Hilda's First Week
At The Beauty Salon...

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,900
Oh.
So We're Surprising Her.

20
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,200
Uh, But I Was Gonna Go
To The Movies.

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,700
You're Going To
The Movies Alone?

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,300
Betty, You Can't Keep Moping
Over This Henry Thing.

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,200
You Need To Be
With Your Family...

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,100
And Food.
No. You Know What, Dad?

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,500
You Can't Keep Tempting Me
With Food.

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,700
It's Not
Gonna Work Anymore.

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,800
(Singsongy Voice)
I Made Carne Asada.

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:09,500
Just One Bite.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,500
(Whispers) Hurry.

30
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,900
(Betty, Ignacio And Justin)
Surprise!

31
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,300
There She Is,
Queeof The...

32
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,600
Hairstylist... To The Stars.

33
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,000
I Should've
Worked On This.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, Stop.
It's Just A Job.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,300
No Biggie, Okay?

36
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,300
No Biggie? Hilda,
You're Following Your Dream.

37
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,000
We Are So Proud
Of You, <I>Mija.</I>
Oh.

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,100
Forget Dreams. Tell Me About
The Bumble And Bumble Salon.

39
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,900
I Heard One Time
Beyonc?Went In There To Get

40
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,100
Her Weave Tightened, But Fergie
Wanted The Appointment,

41
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,000
So She
Totally Bitch-Slapped Her.
Hey.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,800
What? There's
No Other Word For It.
I Think What Justin

43
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,100
Is That We're All Very Excited
About Your New Job.
We Are.

44
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,900
Oh, Come On, You Guys.

45
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,600
You Know, I Don't Like To Be
The Center Of Attention.

46
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Okay, I Love You.

47
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,500
Congratulations.
My Movie Starts At 7:00.
You're Going To A Movie?

48
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Uh-Huh.
Alone.

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,700
Why Don't We All Go?

50
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,300
"Project Runway's"
A Rerun Tonight.

51
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,300
Yeah, I Can Pack Up
The Carne Asada.

52
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, Yeah, Betty.
Get Your Big Purse.
No!

53
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,600
Uh, No.

54
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,000
Dad Made
This Beautiful Dinner.

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,100
We Should Stay.
Forget About The Movie.

56
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,000
Um, I'm Gonna
Go Hang My Coat.

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,500
Okay.

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,000
(Whispering) Henry.

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,600
(Henry Whispering) Betty.
Henry.

60
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,700
Bey.

61
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,600
Oh, Uh, I Can't Go.

62
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,000
I Know.
Your Family's Really Loud.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,600
I'm Sorry. They Just...
They Don't Want Me To Be Alone.

64
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,000
(Normal Voice) Monday Daniel
Didn't Want You To Be Alone,

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,100
And On Tuesday, Christina
Didn't Want You To Be Alone.

66
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,100
Shh.
(Normal Voice) I Know.

67
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,400
They're Just--They're Trying
To Help Me Get Over You.

68
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,100
We See Less Of Each Other Now
Than We Did

69
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,700
Before We Were Going Out.
(Ignacio Laughs)

70
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,100
Wouldn't It Just Be Easier
To Tell Them The Truth?
No. No, We Can't.??

71
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,300
We're Doing Something
Really Stupid, Henry.

72
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,900
You're Leaving For Tucson
In Five Months,

73
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,200
And I Don't Need Them
Telling Me

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,100
??

75
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,200
ok...

76
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,300
you are right???

77
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,000
i miss you??

78
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,300
I'm Here Now.

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
(Hilda) Betty!

80
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Hide!
Aah. Oh!

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,300
(Clattering)
Oh.

82
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,900
Come Inside.

83
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,800
<I>Papi</I> Unscrewed
The Good Wine.

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,000
(Whispers) I'm Sorry.

85
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,700
I Gotta Go. I'm Sorry.

86
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,400
(Christina) Ugh!

87
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,200
Just Got The Designer Swimwear
For The Preview Issue,

88
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,400
And, Once Again,
Summer Is Not Going To Be Kind

89
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,300
To The Big Girls.

90
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,400
Hello?

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,700
This Aects Both Of Us,
You Know. Look At That.

92
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,800
Come On.
Christina, I Gotta
Ask You Something.

93
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,600
You Know How Sometimes You Say
You're Not Gonna Have A Drink,

94
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,700
But Secretly, You've Got
This Great Bottle Of Alcohol,

95
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,200
Like--
Like A 20-Year-Old Bourbon.

96
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,700
No, No, No, No, Better.
A Single Malt Whiskey.
Yeah.

97
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,500
No--Or Just Like Maybe
An Iced Cold Bottle Ofeer--

98
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,600
Oh, Okay, It Doesn't Matter.
You've Got This Booze,

99
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,000
And You Can't
Tell Anyone About It

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,200
Because They Know
It's Bad For You.

101
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,600
But All You Can Think About
Is Going Home And Drinking

102
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,800
And Drinking--
What Is This,
A Bloody Intervention?

103
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,300
Because I Can Give Up
Whenever I Want.
No, No. This Has Nothing??

104
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,300
??

105
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,100
Okay, Let's Start Over. Uh, Say
You Have A Dozen Doughnuts And--

106
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,000
Christina, I Have
Your Budget Approvals.

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,400
Oh, Betty.
Henry.

108
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,700
I Have To Go.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,100
Oh, My God.
<I>He's</I> Your Doughnuts.

110
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,100
Yes.

111
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,200
And He's Delicious,
And I Can't Tell Anyone.

112
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,100
But, Betty, He's Got
Charlie And The Baby,

113
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,200
And He's Leaving,
And It's Crazy.
Shh.

114
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,300
But It's Ao Very Hot.

115
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,500
Oh, But You Could Get
Your Heart Broken.

116
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,700
Yeah, But Who Cares?
It's Also Hot, Hot.

117
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,100
I Know,
But It--It's Wrong.
Or Is It Right?

118
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,500
Either Way, We Have
To Keep It A Secret.
Secret Romance,

119
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,800
But That Means We Never
Get To See Each Other.

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
We Haven't Even...

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,700
Ooh, Ooh, Cold, Cold.
I Know.

122
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,500
Okay, So You Wanna
Keep It Secret?

123
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,100
Use Me
As Your Cover Tonight, Okay?

124
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,300
But You've Gotta Take
That Doughnut,

125
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,000
And You've Got To Bite It
And Dunk It In Your Coffee

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,700
And Get It Hot, Warm And Wet,
And Then... (Grunts)

127
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,600
Bite Into It Again
And--Oh, God, I Need A Drink.

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,000
I Ne A Doughnut.

129
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,500
(Bradford) This Is Unbelievable,
Daniel.

130
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,800
I Told You, Atlantic Attire
Said I Had To Let Go Of Alexis

131
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,500
Or They Would Pull
Their Advertising.

132
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,200
What Was I Supposed To Do,
Fire Her?

133
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,600
Take Her Name Off
The Masthead For Three Months.

134
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,400
Then You Offer This Guy
Six Issues

135
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,700
At Half Our Normal Rate--
Basic Business.

136
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,500
I Guess I Didn't Think--
You Didn't Think.

137
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,000
You Just Told Him To Take
His Business Elsewhere.
Okay, Guys. It Happened.

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,600
Why Don't We Try

139
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,800
And Get Some Big Players
In For The Next Issue?

140
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,600
When I Was At Hudson,

141
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,300
I Had Some Great Contacts
At Ralph Lauren.

142
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Yeah, I Mean, I Know Some People
In Ralph Lauren, Too.

143
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,000
You've Done Enough.
Alexis Will Take Care Of It.

144
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,100
Oh!
(Betty) Whoa.

145
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,800
Hei hei Hello.

146
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,600
Gio, Hi.
What Are You Doing Here?

147
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,800
Phase One Of Giovanni Rossi's
5-Year Plan.

148
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,600
I Rented Out
The Little Sandwich Kiosk

149
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,100
Down In The Lobby.
Oh, That's Great.

150
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,900
And Because You Got Me Canned
From My Old Job,

151
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,700
Which Lit A Re
Under Me... Three Coupons.

152
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,400
Ah, A Free Cookie.

153
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,200
But You Know What?
You Did Geme Canned,

154
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,200
So Let's Make It Two.
You're Welcome.

155
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,500
"Coming Soon--
Gio'sandwiches." Hmm.

156
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,400
What's With The Face?

157
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, No, It...
It's Just A Littlery.

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,500
Maybe You Could Try
Something Catchy.

159
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,400
Oh, Like That Doughnut Shop
Downstairs.

160
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,900
"A <I>Hole</I> Lotta Fun."
That Just Makes Me Smile.

161
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,500
Oh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.

162
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,100
That's Also The Name Of
A Strip Club In Bayside.

163
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,700
Ew, And Now
I Know You Better.

164
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,700
So You Make Sandwiches.

165
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,100
How About Calling It, Uh...
"On A Roll"?

166
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,700
Oh, No, Wait--
"Hero Worship"!

167
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,100
And You Could Have
A Little Cartoon Sandwich

168
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,500
Who Flexes His Muscles.

169
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,700
I Already Have 500 Flyers
That Say "Gio's Sandwiches"

170
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,100
And... A Pickle
With A Smiley Face.

171
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,300
Well, Th's Good, Too.

172
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,400
Oh, Uh, Excuse Me,
But Think About It.

173
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,600
Okay.

174
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,400
Daniel, So How Was
Your Meeting With Your Father?

175
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,000
The Usual. Alexis Is
Gonna Save The Magazine.

176
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,900
Daniel Is A Dumb-Ass Trying Not
To Trip Over His Own Shoes.

177
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,800
(Bradford Laughs) Daniel...
(Alexis Laughs)

178
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,600
Well, You N't Keep Letting
What Your Father Says About--

179
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,200
It's Okay, Betty.
I Actually Have A Plan.

180
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,100
You Do?

181
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,100
Try Not To Be
So Skeptical.

182
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,900
I Actually Need
You To Call Ad Sales.

183
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,400
Get All Of Their Leads.

184
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,500
Alexis Isn't The Only One
Who Can Save This Place.

185
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
I'm Gonna Go Find Us
An Advertiser.

186
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,400
Damn It.

187
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,300
Hey, Party In The Village
Last Night.

188
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,000
You Will Not Believe
Whose Boob Popped Out.

189
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,500
Oh, Need To Know. Not Now.
We're At Code Fuchsia.

190
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,000
(Gasps) You Got
Someone Pregnant?

191
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
Oh, That's Code Never.

192
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,400
Wilhelmina's Daughter
Nico Called.

193
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,100
She's Not Coming
To The Wedding.

194
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,900
(Gasps)
Oh, My God.

195
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,200
Dot Worry.
I Am Your Friend,

196
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,300
And I Will Be Here For You
Noatter What.

197
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,700
(Wilhelmina) Someone's
Getting Fired Today.
(Amanda Gasps)

198
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh, Is Daniel Calling Me?
I Think I Have To Go. Bye.

199
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,900
Wilhelmina Slater, Everyone.

200
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,900
How Was Your Dress Fitting?
Disastrous.

201
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,000
I Haven't Eaten In 10 Days
And I Overshot My Target Weight.

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
My Custom Vera Wang Makes Me
Look Like A White Silk Shar-Pei.

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And That Diva Wang Said

204
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,100
There Wasn't Enough Time
To Alter The Boning.

205
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,800
Oh, What Does Wang Know
About Boning, Anyway?

206
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,900
(Gasps) Oh.

207
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,600
Stop. Meatbread.
Stop It.

208
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,100
Stop It.

209
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,900
I Have To Gain 6 Pounds
By Saturday To Fill It Out.

210
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,900
Oh.
(Sighs) Look At Her.

211
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,700
She Makes It Seem
So Easy.

212
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,300
Hang On.

213
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,400
(Sniffs) I Smell Fear.
What Did You Do Wrong?

214
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Oh, Willie, Wrong Is Really
A Matter Of Perception.

215
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,100
You See, Sometimes In Life,
We Have To--Aah!

216
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,300
Nico Got Bit
By Her Pet Monkey,

217
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,400
And She's Fine,
But She's Quarantined

218
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,300
And She Can't Make It
Tohe Wedding.

219
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,200
Terrific. Now I Have To Redo
The Seating Charts Again.

220
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,300
Um, Isn't She Also
Your Maid Of Honor?

221
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,800
Oh, Marc.

222
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,900
I Have Flower Problems
And Catering Problems,

223
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,600
And Bradford Wants Something
Called A "Shania Twain"

224
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,500
To Perform At Our Reception.

225
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,200
I Have Way Bigger Issues.

226
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,300
Find Out What Betty
Is Having For Lunch

227
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,200
And... Order Me Two.

228
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,400
Oh, Hello, Accountant.

229
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, Hello,
Daniel's Assistant.

230
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,100
I Just Need Your Signature
Right Here On That--Oops.

231
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,300
Oh.

232
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,400
I Opped It.

233
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,200
So, Look, Um...
I Was Feeling Really Bad

234
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,800
About E Fact That
I Haven't Made Time For You,

235
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,200
And I Was Thinking Maybe Tonight
We Could Have A Real Date?

236
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,100
What Do You Have In Mind?

237
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,600
Well, We Never Got To See
"Wicked" Last Year

238
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,000
Like We Wanted.
"Wicked"? Wicked Awesome.

239
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,800
And Then, Maybe Afterward,
The Date Could Continue?

240
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,000
(Objects Clatter)
Ow.

241
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,300
Yeah, Yeah.
That Could Be Good.

242
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,700
I Mean, Whatever.

243
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,200
(Daniel) Bet?
(Bell Dings)

244
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,600
Oh.

245
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,700
There Is
Nothing Going On.

246
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,100
He Was Just Signing
Some Papers Under The Desk.

247
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,300
We Always Do It That Way.
I'm Protecting Your Privacy.

248
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,700
Are You Forgetting
How Crushed You Were

249
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,000
When He Left You
The First Time?

250
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,800
Daniel,
I Am Not Dating Henry.

251
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,900
Because If You Were, I'd Have To
Seriously Think About

252
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,000
Getting Rid Of Him.
Murder?

253
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,300
What? No. God,
I Hate That It's So Easy

254
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,900
To Go There With My Family.
No, I Mean Fire Him.

255
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,600
I'm Not Gonna Let Him
Break Your Heart Twice, Betty.
You'd Actually Do That?

256
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,000
Come On, Betty.
You Butt Into My Life

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
All E Time
Because You Care About Me.

258
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,400
Like It Or Not,
I Care About You, Too.

259
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,200
Well, U Have Nothing
To Worry About.

260
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,600
Will You Please Hide
Your Mutt?

261
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,500
If Wilhelmina Sees It,

262
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,600
She's Gonna Melt Cheese
On It And Eat It.

263
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,700
Hey, You.

264
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Oh... (Clears Throat)

265
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,100
(Halston Barks)
Halsn, That's Prada!

266
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,800
Hey, Bud.

267
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,200
"Bud"? Hey, That's
Your Friend, Amanda, Right?

268
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,500
Oh, No, No, No, No, No.
Amanda's Much Prettier.

269
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,000
What Are You Doing Here?
(Baby Talk Voice) I Just Miss
My Wittle Marc-Y Marc.

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,500
Ew, I Thought We Talked
About That Voice.

271
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,200
You Were Gonna Retire It
And Move It To Florida.
(Normal Voice)

272
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,300
??

273
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,200
Oh, Am I Gonna Seeou
Tonight For Dinner?
Yeah, Sure. My Place?

274
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
(Groans) We Always Eat
At Your Place

275
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,400
When We're Not
Eating At My Place.

276
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,500
You Know,
I Hear New York Has

277
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,800
These Little Things
Called Restaurants.
Oh, But Restaurants Have??

278
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,900
(Clears Throat)
And... Lights. Blah.
Okay, Starting To Get??

279
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,300
What?
Do You Not Want To Be Seen
With Me Or Sometng?

280
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,700
What? No. That's Crazy.

281
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,200
(Laughs) But I Forgive
Your Foolishss.

282
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,000
Great.

283
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,900
I'll Make A Reservation
At Craft For 8:00.

284
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,900
Tee-Riff. Craft It Is.

285
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,000
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

286
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,300

<I>Very</I> Homophobic.

287
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,200

288
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,000
No. (Sighs)
So "Wicked's" Sold Out?

289
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,900
Well, There's Gotta
Be Something.

290
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,000
No, Don't Wanna See
"Mama Mia."

291
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,200
Well, Becae "Wicked" Means
Something Really Special

292
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,700
To The Boy I'm Dating,
And Abba Means Nothing.

293
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,700
Oh, Come On, Haven't You Ever
Had An Office Romance?

294
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,400
You Know,
You're Selling Tickets,

295
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,500
And--And The Guy
In The Cubicle Next To You

296
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,100
Is Selling Tickets,
And Then Your Eyes Meet And--

297
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,600
Office Romance?

298
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,900
Ma
You're Always Just There.

299
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,100
Uh, Okay, So You Heard
"Office Romance,"

300
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,000
And Now You're Thinking,
I Have To Get Rid Of Henry.

301
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,300
But You Don't, Because...

302
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm Not Dating Henry.

303
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,900
I'm... Dating...

304
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,900
Uh... That Guy!

305
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,609
Oh, I Just Love It
When He Does That.

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,300
This Is Disaster.

311
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,300
I Knew The Maid Of Honor Thing
Would Hit You Eventually,

312
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,300
But I Have An Idea--
We'll Video Conference Nico,

313
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,200
That Way She Can--
This Is Not About Nico.
Look.

314
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Chocolates. Disastrous.
Why Again?

315
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,700
These Are The Favors
For The Reception.

316
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,200
There's Supposed To Be Onehite
And One Dark In Each Box.

317
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,300
Ebony And Ivory.
My Wedding Theme?

318
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,100
Oh.

319
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,300
That Idiot Wedding Planner
Has Gone And Segregated Them.
This Is Unacceptable.

320
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,000
What Do We Want?
Integrated Chocolates.

321
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
When Do We Want Them?
Now.

322
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
(Sighs) If I Want
Anything Done Right,

323
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,400
I Have To Plan It Myself.

324
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Get Me The Seating Chart.

325
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,700
Willie, You Can't Do This
All Yourself.

326
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,100
Hey, Why Don't I Stay
With You Tonight

327
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,400
And Help You Get
Through All This?

328
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,600
However Long It Takes.

329
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,400
You Don't Have
Any Of Your <I>Gay</I> Plans?

330
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,900
Mnh-Mnh.

331
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,100
What Could I Do, Cliff?
She's Ordering Me To Stay Late.

332
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,800
I Know. She Totally Is
With A Capital ""

333
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,300
I'm So Sorry.

334
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,100
Hey, Betty.

335
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,700
You Know, There's Something

355
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,600

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,100
Okay.

Her Cigarette Out On My Arm.

00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,200
But Don't Worry.

00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh, And, Uh, Daniel.

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So Did Amanda Give You
Those Tickets To "Wicked"?
Oh, Yeah.

375
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,200
I Gave Them To Your Boyfriend.
He Seemed Pretty Excited.

376
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,600
So I'm Just Curis,

377
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,800
Being Your Boyiend And All,
Am I A Gentle Lover?
Ew. Shut Up.

378
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,600
I Had To Tell My Boss
I Was Going Out With Someone,

379
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,200
And You Were
The First Guy I Saw.

380
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,500
Flattered.
Why Are You Lying To Him?

381
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,400
Because, Well, I--

382
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,700
I'm Dating Someone That I Don't
Want Daniel To Know About.

383
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,100
Ooh, You're Cheating On Me
After I Was So Gentle?

384
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,400
Stop It. Can I Just
Have My Tickets, Please?
First Tell Me??

385
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,800
No.
Tell Me Who You're Dating.

386
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,200
Why Don't You Just
Get Your Own Life?

387
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,700
Please?

388
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,100
Okay, Henry From Accounting.

389
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, Yeah.

(Sighs) Okay...
He Got A Girl Pregnant,

392
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,300
And I Don't Want Daniel
To Know That I'm Dating Him,

393
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:21,900
Because If He Does,

394
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,500
He's Just Gonna Tell Me
That I'm Being Stupid.

395
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,700
Wow.
You Are Being Stupid.

396
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,400
You're A Very Rude
Fake Boyfriend.

397
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,200
Now Can I Have
My Tickets, Please?

398
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,000
Uh, No.
Uh, The Other One, Too.

399
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I Need To Be Prepared In Case
Daniel Asks Me About The Show.

400
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,600
What? Are You Kidding?
Hey, He Gave Them
To Both Of Us, Oy?

401
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,000
You Do What U Want
With Yours,

402
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,200
And I'm Gonna Do
What I Want With Mine.

403
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,400
Well, I'm Not Gonna
Go With <I>You.</I>

404
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,900
Thank You For Ruining
My Special Night.

00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,800
Oh, And I Have News

406
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,000

(Scoffs) It's...

408
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,400

411
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,500
Why Are You Talking
About That Guy's Pickle?

412
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,600
Never Mind.

413
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Oh, Amanda.

414
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,800

Look, Daniel Says You Have
Access To Theater Tickets.

418
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,600
Please, I--I'll Do
Anything You Want.

419
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,000
Why Are You
Smiling Like That?

420
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,500
I Was Just Picturing You
Walking Halston For A Month.

421
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,300
Okay.

422
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,900
??

423
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,400
I'd Say Your Chances
For Making This Cover

424
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,599

(Chuckles)

425
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,000
Excuse Me.
I'll Be Right Back.
Okay.

426
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,600
Dude, Things Are
Getting <I>Hot</I> Downstairs.

427
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,200
I've Been Shooting
Swimsuit Previews,

428
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,800
Once Again, The Summer's
Gonna Be Kind To The Big Girls.

429
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,000
(Laughs) Hello?
This Affects Both Of Us.

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,300
I Just Hope There's
Still A Magazine

431
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,800
When The Time Comes
To Print A Swimsuit Issue.
What Are You Talking About?

432
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,600
I Lost
A Bunch Of Advertisers,

433
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,200
And I Thought I Had A Shot
At Landing Prada,

434
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,900
But I Just--I Blew It.

435
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,900
Let Me See Who
You're Going After.

436
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,100
Michael Sheeter, Armani.
Larry Champion, Cartier...

437
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,900
We Have A Winner.

438
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,600
Four Words--
San-Dra Win-Throp.

439
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,700
When You Say "Four Words,"
You Mean "Syllables"?

440
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,700
She Owns
Some Jewelry Company.

441
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,400
I Did A Shoot
For Her Last Year.

442
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,800
Over 50 And Foxy...
(Growls)

443
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,900
Are You Saying
I Have To Hit On Her

444
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,000
To Try To Get Her
To Buy Ad Space?

445
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,200
If You Wanna Land
Your Advertiser,

446
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,400
<I>Land</I> Your Advertiser.

447
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,400
<I>Ay.</I>

448
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,700
Justin, You Scared
The Crap Out Of Me.

449
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,500
So How Was Work?

450
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,300
Oh, You Know, Cut Some Hair,
Did A Little Coloring.

451
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,600
(Chuckles) And Now Mommy Wants
To Put Her Feet Up

452
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,200
And Watch Some "Extra."

453
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,800
I Read On The Internet
That Madonna Came In Today.

454
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh, Yeah, Sure.
She Was There.

455
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,500
I Got Kabbalah This,
Kabbalah That.

456
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,400
Liar! Madonna's
Recording In London

457
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,600
Till The End
Of The Month.

458
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,100
Whoa. Okay, So She Wasn't
Really There.

459
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,400
What Is Going On
With You?

460
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,600
No, What's Going On
With You?

461
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,700
My Friend Duncan's Father
Says, "Hi."

462
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,600
Or Should I Say,
"Hi-Ems"?

463
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,700
Oh, Crap.

464
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,900
What Happened
To Bumble And Bumble?

465
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,000
Okay, Look.

466
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,300
Maybe I Offered
Some Constructive <I>Suggestions</I>

467
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,900
To One
Of The Stylists There.

468
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,800
You Got Fired?

469
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,000
Well, It's Not Like
He Had To Take Them!

470
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,600
So You've Been Pretending To Go?
Why Would You Lie To Us?

471
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,000
Because  Meant So Much
To You And <I>Papi.</I>

472
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,300
I Was Following
My Dreams.

473
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,100
You Guys Put Up
Freaking Balloon.

474
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,000
But, Mom, Hi-Beems.
Seriously?

475
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,500
Yeah, I Was Looking
For A Salon Job For A Month.

476
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,500
You Know How Many
Offers I Got? One.

477
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,400
And I Got Fired From That
On The First Day.

478
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,500
So After A While,
You Gotta Be Practical.

479
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,900
And We Needed The Money
More Than I Needed To...

480
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,400
Follow My Dreams.

481
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Can You Believe This?

482
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,200

Not Your Type?
It's Like He Ate Your Type.

636
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,300
Okay, But What You Don't Know
Is That He's Really Sweet.

637
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,700
He Wrote Me A Poem And Left It
On My Bathroom Mirror.

638
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,500
He Met Tyrese At
A Photo Shoot

639
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,200
And Got Him To Call Me
On My Cell Phone.

640
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,100
And Sometimes, He Does
This Thing Where He Pretends

641
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,900
Like His Belly Button Is
A Mouth, And He Puts On

642
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,900
A Little Puppet Show For Me,
And He Calls Him Mr. Gutley.

643

646
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,900
(Normal Voice) Oh,
I Don't Know Anymore.

647
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,400
I Never Liked
A Guy Like Cliff. Oh!

648
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,200
What Do I Do? Let Him Go Just
Because He Doesn't Use Product?

649
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,900
Cliff Or Mr. Guty?

650
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,200
Oh, That Stupid Belly Button
Makes Me Laugh!

651
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,700
I Don't Wanna End Up Sad
And Alone Like Wilhelmina.
Oh.

652
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,900

653
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,200
Not To Come
To Her Wedding.

654

655
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,200

665
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,300
I Guess E... Reason
Why I Was Putting Off

666
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,400
Finding Another
Maid Of Honor

667
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,700
Was Because I Hoped That
Nico Would Change Her Mind.

668
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,500
But Apparently
She Hates Me.

669
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,700
She Doesn't Hate You.

670
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,600
Oh, Marc, Monkey Bite?

671
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,300
But You're Wrong
About Me Being Alone.

672
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,500
I Have Hundreds Of Backstabbing,
Two-Faced, Superficial Friends

673
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,800
That Are Pouring In
From All Over The Globe

674
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,300
To Be Part
Of This Wedding.

675
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,100
Any Of Them Would Be Thrilled
To Be My Maid Of Honor.

676
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,200
Wilhelmina Slater
R Victoria Beckham, Please.

677
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,100
Yes, I'll Hold.

678
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,900
Oh, Marc,
I Forgot To Ask.

679
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,200
Who Are You Bringing
To The Wedding?

680
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,900
I Get A Plus One?

681
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,700
Well, We Wouldn't Want You
To End Up Sad And Alone.

682
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,000
Vicki, Love, It's Willie.

683
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,800
How Is My Best Friend
In The Whole Wide World?

684
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,700

685
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,600
??

686
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,500
I Really Screwed Up.

687
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,100
(Sandra) Daniel,
What Are You Up To?

688
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,800

692
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,400
Oh, Daniel.
We Are Being So Bad.

693
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,300
Come On. She's Green.
She's A Witch.

694
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,700
Girl Power. Rah, Rah, Rah.
I Think We Get It.

695
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,100
I Just Simply
Can't Be Seduced

696
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,300
In A Room Full
Of Nylon And Fleece.
All Right. Well,

697
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,500
That Is Betty's Coat.
I...

698
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,800
Mm. You Really Should
Give That Girl A Raise.

699
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,000
Uh, Sandra...

700
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,000
I Can't.

701
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,400
Well, Then Don't
Give Her A Raise.

702
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,100
Everyone Gets So Touchy
About Money.

703
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,200
No, No, No, No. I... Sandra,
You're Beautiful. I Just...

704
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,000
I Can't Seduce You To Get
You To Buy Ads In Our Magazine.

705
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,700
I'm Not Letting You
Seduce Me For My Ads.

706
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,400
I'm Letting You Seduce Me
Ause You Got A Great Ass.

707
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,600
Really?
Mm-Hmm.

708
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,300
Well, I Have Added Squats
To My Workout Lately.

709
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,700
All Right, Putting The Sex Aside
For A Minute,
Oh.

710
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,500
What Do I Have To Do
To Get Your Advertising?

711
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,000
Well, Why Should I
Move Over From "Glamour"?

712
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,800
Well, Winthrop Jewelry's Revenue
Has Dropped 15%

713
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,000
In The Last Quarter Alone,
Righ

714
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,300
"Mode" Can Help You
Get To The Future Clientele--

715
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,300
The 18 To 49s
That You've Been Missing.

716
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,300
Yes, I Have Been Missing
Those 18 To 49 Year Olds.

717
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,000
In The Last Year Alone,
"Mode" Has Increed

718
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,100
In That Demographic 12%.

719
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,400
Other Magazines Have Dropped.

720
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,800
"Mod Has Always Stayed
In Mode.

721
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,000
Bet You're Proud
Of That One, Huh?
A Little.

722
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,100
Well, You Actually Made
Some Good Points.

723
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,300
I'll Tell You What, Sugar,

724
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,800
I'll Have My Ad Rep
Call You In The Morning.

725
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,600
Maybe We Should, Uh,
Go Out And Celebrate, Huh?

726
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,900
You're A Smart Guy, Daniel,
And That Tush Is Darling,

727
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,300
But Frankly, Smart Guys
Are A Turn-Off.

728
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,400
(Gulps)
Should I Be Insulted?

729
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,700
That Door's Gotta Be
Around Here Somewhere.
(Gasps)

730
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,800
Oh, My God. We Can't Be Here.
They've Got Theater Cops.

731
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,200
Well, Come On.
Come On.

732
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,100
(Woman)
Well, Are You Comi?

733
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,900
What If They Find Us
In Here?

734
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,500
You Know What?
Who Cares?

735
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,800
This Is The First Time
We've Been Alone All Night.

736
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
What Was That?
I Don't Care.

737
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,800
Whoa.

738
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,000
What The...

739
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,400
Oh, My God.
It's Moving.

740
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,100
(Woman) What The...

741
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,200
Holy Crap.

742
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,100
Smile, Betty.
We're On Broadway.

743
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,900
Ay, Okay, We're Going.

744
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,400
I Can't Believe They Banned Us
From "Wicked" For Life.

745
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,300
I Can't Believe
Daniel Saw Us.

746
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,400
He Knows About Us.
We're Screwed.

747
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,400
Betty, Betty, Calm Down.
We'll Figure Ts All Out.

748
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,600
Let's Just Get
Out Of Here, Okay?

749
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Uh, Wait--Wait, Um,
I Forgot My Purse And My Coat.

750
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Uh, Can You Just Grab
A Cab And I'll Meet You?

751
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,700
Yeah, Yeah. Okay.

752
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,300
Okay.

753
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,500
Betty.

754
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,300
Daniel.

755
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,200
You Lied To Me.

756
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,300
Okay, Uh,
I'm Dating Henry.

757
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,000
And Now You Can Call Me Crazy,
And You Can Fire Him,

758
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And You Can Totally
Manipulate My Life,

759
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,400
But I Can't Keep
Pretending Anymore.

760
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,700
You're Gonna Get
Your Heart Broken.

761
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,800
It's My Heart.
What Does That Mean?

762
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,900
You'reot Gonna Be Devastated
When He Leaves You?

763
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,000
What, You're Above That?

764
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,200
You Know, The One Thing
I Always Thought You H

765
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,400
Was Good Judgment,
But Right Now, Thi-

766
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,500
I Don't Understand
Why You're Being So Stupid.

767
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,200
Stupid.

768
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,800
Thank You.

769
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,100
Betty, I Got A Cab.
What's Wrong?

770
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,300
Henry, I'm Sorry,

771
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,200
But I Don't Think
I Can Do This...

772
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,000
Uh...

773
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,000
Not Tonight.

774
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,000
You And Henry?

775
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,500
Pregna Henry?

776
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,900
Have You Two Even...

777
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,800
No.
Tonight Was Supposed To Be...

778
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,300
You Know What? It Doesn't
Even Matter Anymore.

779
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,400
Wow, Betty.

780
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,400
I Know, And Please Just
Don't Tell Me How Stupid I Am.

781
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,500
I Can't Ar To Hear
That From You, Too.

782
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Oh, No, No, No, No, No.
You're Stupid.
Hilda.

783

784
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,200
And You're Here Talking To Me.

785
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,600
You Know, If Someone Told Me
I Could Have

786
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,200
One More Minute With Santos,

787
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,400
Do You Think
I Would Turn That Down

788
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,500
Because It Wld Hurt
When It Was Over?

789
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,700
I Guess Not.
Mnh-Mnh.

790
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,500
But W-What If--
What Are You
Still Doing Here?

Oh, But, Um,

799
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,000
Maybe We Shouldn't
Tell Dad.

800
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,500
Oh, Yeah, No.
I'm Romantic, Not Crazy.

801
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,100
Okay.

I Had To Tell Him.

00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,300
About The Job,
About The Iform.

807
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,200
I Didn't Have A Choice.
It's The Only Job I Could Get.

808
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,800
(Both) Surprise!

809
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,500

816
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,000
I Couldn't Last
At A Salon For A Day.

817
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,200
Think I Could
Run My Own Business?

818
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,100
