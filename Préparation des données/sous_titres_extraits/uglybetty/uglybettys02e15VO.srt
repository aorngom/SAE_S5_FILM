1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,862
 Previously on "ugly betty"... 

2
00:00:01,862 --> 00:00:04,269
charlie, I didn't even know you were in town.

3
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:05,238
Do you remember how you felt watching me

4
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:06,315
hit on all those women?

5
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:09,206
That's how I feel every time I see gio around you.

6
00:00:09,206 --> 00:00:10,613
I hate that you feel that way.

7
00:00:10,613 --> 00:00:11,941
I just won't see him anymore.

8
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:13,300
Betty!

9
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:15,113
Want a ride?

10
00:00:15,113 --> 00:00:17,050
I'm here to warn you about renee.

11
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,641
I don't believe anything you have to say.

12
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:20,425
Why are you trying to break up me and daniel?

13
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:21,816
Renee, we both know what happens to you

14
00:00:21,816 --> 00:00:23,675
when things get too serious with men.

15
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:25,363
(Renee) this is nothing like stony brook.

16
00:00:25,363 --> 00:00:26,863
I had a breakdown.

17
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,113
I take these.

18
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:29,612
(Wilhelmina) good job, marc.

19
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,925
Those pills are all that stand

20
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:33,050
between my sister and the nuthouse.

21
00:00:33,488 --> 00:00:36,800
 No candles... ever.

22
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:40,253
it's 2:00 in the morning.

23
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:43,300
That gives us five hours till your next meeting.

24
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,988
(Daniel) how can you sound so chipper?

25
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:47,613
We've been up till 2:00 A.M.
For the last five nights.

26
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:48,675
I can barely think.

27
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:50,487
Well, I have to be chipper enough for the both of us.

28
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:52,425
And besides, past midnight,

29
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:54,175
"mode" pays to send me home in a town car,

30
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:54,999
which is pretty cool.

31
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:56,409
Do you know they have free btles of water?

32
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:57,987
Yes, and a minibar.

33
00:00:57,987 --> 00:01:01,425
Don't touch that. Daniel,I need you sharp at 7:00 A.M.

34
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:02,175
oh, hold on.

35
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:02,831
I have another call.

36
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:04,050
Go ahead.

37
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,112
Betty!

39
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,237
Daniel isn't home yet,and I'm worried.

40
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,628
Hi, renee.

41
00:01:11,628 --> 00:01:13,987
Uh, yeah, his meeting went really late,

42
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:15,691
but I have him on the other line right now.

43
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:17,237
Oh, thank god.

44
00:01:17,237 --> 00:01:18,128
Put me through.

45
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:20,753
I just have to go over his schedule for tomorrow first.

46
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:21,769
Betty, please.

47
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:23,300
I really need to talk to him.

48
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,425
Okay. All right.

49
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:30,238
daniel, uh, you have renee on the line.

50
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:30,863
Hey, baby.

51
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:32,300
Hi, sexy.

52
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,863
I'm just lying on the bed...

53
00:01:33,863 --> 00:01:35,550
all alone.

54
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,753
Are you wearing those new panties I got you?

55
00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:38,999
Not anymore.

56
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,738
No--oh. Oh.

57
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,112
women don't really do this,do they?

58
00:01:49,112 --> 00:01:50,894
Yes, they do,

59
00:01:50,894 --> 00:01:52,925
and they're usually wearing bikinis and covered in mud.

60
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,550
Really?

61
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,519
Hi, I'm calling from hilda's beautilities

62
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,925
with a glamour opportunity or...

63
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:02,300
a glamour-tunity!

64
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,050
Hello? Hello?

65
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,565
how manyalls is that?

66
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:09,238
15. I guess people in queens just don't care about beauty.

67
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:12,112
I need 30 sandwiches before the editorial meeting,

68
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:13,999
or people will forget to eat again,

69
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,691
and daniel doesn't want anyone passing out like last year.

70
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:17,800
Excuse me.

71
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,050
Thank you, gio.You're the best.

72
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,268
No, you are.

73
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:24,238
No, you arE.You are.

74
00:02:24,238 --> 00:02:25,175
Okay, okay, okay.

75
00:02:25,175 --> 00:02:27,378
I-I'm hanging up now. Bye.

76
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,253
I barely got any sleep last night. I'm a wreck.

77
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:32,988
Daniel's been keeping you late every night this weeK.

78
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:35,987
Yeah, but I spent half the night dealing with his girlfriend.

79
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:37,999
So wait, she just calls you in the middle of the night?

80
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:40,925
No, no, first she calls,then she texts.

81
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,566
It's been going on for, like, a week.

82
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:44,503
It's definitely getting in the way of my work.

83
00:02:44,503 --> 00:02:47,175
Let's not let your hair get in the way, too, huh?

84
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:50,690
I can have this hot mess fixed in two minutes.

85
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:54,625
So what's going on with you and gio?

86
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,363
I heard you guys on the phone.

87
00:02:56,363 --> 00:02:57,862
It's nothing.

88
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:01,863
So... okay, gio and I are friends again. So what?

89
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:04,394
 So... wasn't henry jealous of you guys?

90
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:11,113
(Sighs) yeah, he is,but henry doesn't know that I am talking to gio again.

91
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:13,550
Ooh, drama.

92
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,300
Tell mama hilda everything.

93
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,800
"Mama hilda"?

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,999
I'm trying it out.

95
00:03:18,503 --> 00:03:20,800
Look, gio is a great guy,

96
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,488
and I wanna be his friend,and I don't wanna upset henry.

97
00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:26,175
I mean, he has been so swe since charlie showed up.

98
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:28,675
Yeah, but are you sure hiding things from him--

99
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,613
that's the best thing for your relationship?

100
00:03:30,613 --> 00:03:33,815
Yes.And besides, charlie is leaving for tucson...

101
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:35,315
 today! 

102
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,612
And I want my last four weeks with henry to be stress-free.

103
00:03:38,612 --> 00:03:40,878
Oh, I gotta go.Don't wait up!

104
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:41,675
All right.

105
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,191
Just got a call--

106
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,862
your first appointment.

107
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:47,487
Let me see. Let meee.

108
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:49,425
Is this a joke?

109
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:50,800
This says "gina gambarro."

110
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,862
So I thought you guys made up.

111
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:54,191
We did... till we didn'T.

112
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:57,612
I might have called her a skank to a few people.

113
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,175
Well, she is!

114
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:00,613
Well, apparently she forgives you,

115
00:04:00,613 --> 00:04:02,644
because she wants a manicure.

116
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,863
Mom, don't we need the business...

117
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,316
even skanky business?

118
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,362
Oh, daniel.

119
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:18,988
Good morning. Coffee,your notes for your advertising meeting,

120
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:20,566
rachel zoe got pushed to 11:00,

121
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:22,378
and if you rush back after lunch,

122
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:23,675
I'm hang curtains put in your office

123
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:26,941
so you can nap between 2:00 and 2:45, right before christian siriano.

124
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:28,363
You scheduled a nap for me?

125
00:04:28,363 --> 00:04:29,816
I need you at your best.

126
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:30,675
Oh, I love you.

127
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:31,925
I know. (Sniffs)

128
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:32,999
mmm. You sme good.

129
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:35,425
Oh, it's viktor & rolf,gift from renee.

130
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:37,550
You know, she's always doing little things for me.

131
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:37,863
Yeah.

132
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:40,128
Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

133
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:43,753
Renee keeps calling me  to schedule fun things for you two to do together.

134
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:44,237
See? That's what I mean.

135
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:45,425
She's thoughtful.

136
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:49,363
Yes, but have you taken a look at how packed your schedule is this week?

137
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:50,159
D you make that?

138
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,362
Mm. I have a system.

139
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:55,800
Thing is, she gets mad  every time I tell her

140
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,425
that you obviously don't have time for a cooking class or dinner at lupa.

141
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,941
I know it's a busy week, betty, but I really like this girl.

142
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,300
Can you try and work things out?

143
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:10,612
Okay. Yeah. Sure.

144
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:11,925
Thank you.

145
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:20,363
hi, renee.

146
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:23,300
I'm just concerned,dr. Remus.

147
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,925
Renee's behavior this past week has been so erratic.

148
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:31,613
Is it possible her medication's not working anymore,

149
00:05:31,613 --> 00:05:33,613
or perhaps she stopped taking her pills?

150
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:35,362
Well, it's possible,but it would take some--

151
00:05:35,362 --> 00:05:39,175
well, what symptoms might I look for to know if she's backsliding?

152
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:42,925
Well, your sister has struggled for years with issues of paranoia...

153
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,925
what do you mean he's in a meeting?

154
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:46,300
Well, who's he meeting with?

155
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,191
Is he trying to avoid me?

156
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:48,675
No. Why would you even say that?

157
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:53,200
Probably coinciding with a rise in irrational,jealous behavior...

158
00:05:53,238 --> 00:05:56,191
I know you can't tell me if there's somebody else.

159
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:57,316
You didn't say anything.

160
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:57,988
There is someone, isn't there?

161
00:05:57,988 --> 00:06:00,394
Renee, you didn't even give me a chance to speak.

162
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:04,112
As well, I'd expect you might encounter severe mood swings...

163
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:06,237
no, his afternoon cannot be booked up,

164
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:10,362
because I scheduled his and her massages for us today at bliss.

165
00:06:10,362 --> 00:06:11,550
The weekend would be better.

166
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,999
Bliss!

167
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:16,347
Usually followed by some kind of emotional crash.

168
00:06:16,347 --> 00:06:18,362
Are you... crying?

169
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:19,675
(Crying) no. No.

170
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:27,050
I hesitate to even bring this up,but is there a time we should consider...

171
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,363
committing my poor sister?

172
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,753
We have a lot of work to do.

173
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:34,675
Oh, that's what that means.

174
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:37,754
It's funny how you take away the tiny movements that create wrinkles and suddenly...

175
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:38,425
(singsongy) poker face.

176
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:39,999
Oh, let's get serious, marc.

177
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,659
Right now we only have one problem--

178
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:44,862
dr. Facial hair in there says he won't commit renee

179
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,999
until she is a danger to herself or others.

180
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,737
(Normal voice) danger? We don't want to hurt anyone, do we?

181
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:52,999
Of course not, but the sooner this is over with, the better.

182
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:53,691
Well...

183
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,800
and your future's at stake, too, marc.

184
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,441
Renee knows about bradford's baby

185
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:00,999
and could expose our less-than-legal method of procuring a donor.

186
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:02,706
Well, I switched the pills about a week ago,

187
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:04,707
so the crazy train should be arriving

188
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:06,987
at gare du renee  about, well, now.

189
00:07:06,987 --> 00:07:10,362
Okay, well, if it doesn't,I'm gonna have to give her a little push.

190
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:14,629
Schedule a lunch today with my sister at la brulee...

191
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:15,800
consider it lunched.

192
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,362
Then go back to my place and keep an eye on christina.

193
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:19,050
Ugh. But she scares me.

194
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,582
She's so cranky all the time.

195
00:07:20,582 --> 00:07:21,878
Well, then pamper her.

196
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:23,441
Let's not forget...

197
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:25,909
that walking womb is carrying my heir.

198
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:27,175
Oh, don't pout.

199
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:28,925
You haven't the lips for it.

200
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:34,737
I mean,I know I promised daniel

201
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:36,315
I would try and get along with her,

202
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:38,362
but it's gotten worse today.

203
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:40,050
Renee is driving me nuts.

204
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,425
Hey, just 'cause you promised you'd be nice

205
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:44,675
doesn't mean you let renee walk all over you.

206
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:47,379
Next time she crosses the line, say something.

207
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,550
Oh, uh, well,

208
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,050
it looks like we're all set here with the sandwiches.

209
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,894
Thank you, gio. Bye.

210
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:57,987
Hi.

211
00:07:57,987 --> 00:07:59,753
Uh, hey. Was that gio?

212
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:01,987
What? Oh, yeah.

213
00:08:01,987 --> 00:08:03,999
He was dropping off sandwiches or something.

214
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:06,550
Hey, listen, why don't we celebrate tonight?

215
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,316
You and I should find a place to have dinner at.

216
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:11,500
Betty, I have to tell you something.

217
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,050
It's about charlie.

218
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:18,362
Can I pretend for one second that it's gonna be good news?

219
00:08:18,362 --> 00:08:20,253
She had a panic attack at the airport,

220
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:23,628
and her doctor's afraid it might bring on early labor.

221
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,503
He doesn't want her to travel.

222
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,300
She's staying here?

223
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:29,675
Until the baby's born.

224
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:33,737
Look, I am gonna make this work, I promise.

225
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:36,238
I get it. It's fine.

226
00:08:36,238 --> 00:08:39,999
Besides, new york city is a great place to be born--

227
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:43,425
it's very international,it's got great public transportation.

228
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:44,254
You know what?

229
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:46,300
Um, it's getting really busy around here.

230
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,925
I re--I gotta go.

231
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,488
Betty, I'M...

232
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,441
sorry.

233
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,941
and before you know it,

234
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:06,487
bang--he asked me to be mrs. Dr. Goldfarb.

235
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:08,425
Well, that is quite a story.

236
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:10,925
And the best part about elopin' on a cruise

237
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,363
is we were already in cancN.

238
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:15,643
We honeymooned in his time-share.

239
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:18,363
Mm, that is so great.

240
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:19,988
And also, you shouldn't feel bad.

241
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:21,925
Everyone gains weight on a cruise.

242
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:26,237
You're probably not used to seein' designer clothes.

243
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:28,128
Roomier is a look ya pay for.

244
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:31,925
So, gina, what brings you back to the neighborhood?

245
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:34,738
Just wanted to say hello to all my old friends...

246
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:37,925
And I wanted to know how you're doing, of course.

247
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,237
Oh, things are great.

248
00:09:39,237 --> 00:09:42,503
Got my cosmetology license,I'm running my own business.

249
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:44,800
You are lucky that I could fit you in today.

250
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,363
And I have to say,this place is adorable.

251
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:51,675
It kind of reminds me of my closet up in mount kisco.

252
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:54,815
Yeah, well, we did what we could with the space.

253
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:56,999
It hasn't exactly been the easiest year.

254
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:59,300
Oh, that's right.

255
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,362
I was so sorry to hear about santos, hilda,

256
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:08,050
but if I've learned anything,it's that a higher power has a plan for all of us.

257
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,472
Maybe you're just meant to be alone, and that's okay.

258
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:12,925
Oh, sorry.

259
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:15,925
That's a, um, that's a sensitive part of the nail.

260
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:16,675
All right.

261
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:17,999
I think we are done here.

262
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:19,925
You are so good at this.

263
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:22,800
I think I should come back later and have you do my feet.

264
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,363
Oh, and I could bring larry.

265
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:25,487
It'll be fun.

266
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:28,941
Ciao.

267
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,409
 It's never enough  um, what do you think you're doing?

268
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:41,503
Oh, I'm concerned about daniel's posture,

269
00:10:41,503 --> 00:10:43,940
so I found this great alexander technique teacher,

270
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,999
but he can only see him this afternoon, so...

271
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:50,315
oh, um, see,daniel's schedule is my job,

272
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:53,565
so please don't touch his calendar.

273
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:57,550
Well, he's my boyfriend,so if I want daniel to do something,

274
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,425
you can't stop me, missy.

275
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,300
Well, he's not available this afternoon.

276
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,175
Sorry.

277
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:05,488
 Yes, he is.

278
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:07,238
No, he really isn'T.

279
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:07,628
Let go.

280
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:08,347
You let go.

281
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:10,237
give me back my schedule.

282
00:11:15,438 --> 00:11:16,925
what's goin' on?

283
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:22,488
Daniel, I tried.It's not wking.

284
00:11:22,488 --> 00:11:23,925
I know you really like this girl,

285
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:25,675
but when it comes to is office,

286
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,999
it's her or me.

287
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,128
What the hell was that?

288
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:32,940
Isn't it obvious? Your assistant

289
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,300
is totally in love with you.

292
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,999
I can't believe it's never occurred to you before--

293
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:00,612
the way she follows you around, hanging on your every word.

294
00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:01,999
Well, renee, she's my assistant.

295
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:03,862
That's sort of her job, right?

296
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:06,237
It's so sweet how modest you are.

297
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:08,238
What do you mean?

298
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,550
You exude mystique...

299
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,050
power...

300
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,113
sexuality.

301
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:16,987
Frankly,

302
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:19,613
I'm surprised most women don't just tear your clothes off.

303
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,550
Well, it's happened.

304
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,237
And how many of them have been your assistants?

305
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,987
But that doesn't mean that betty is actually--

306
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:28,987
(gasps) doesn't it?

307
00:12:28,987 --> 00:12:32,425
She spends all day around a man most women would only dream of having...

308
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:36,800
going over your schedule,determining where you go...

309
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,816
which women you can talk to.

310
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,769
No, she does do that--

311
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,675
look, I'm just saying be careful.

312
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:46,175
You know, I've seen this sort of thing happen before,

313
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:49,425
and it can become a problem.

314
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:52,800
Maybe you should ask yourself,

315
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,597
is there something you might have said to lead her on?

316
00:12:56,312 --> 00:12:58,237
 (Daniel) you scheduled a nap for me?

317
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,269
 Oh, I love you.

318
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:00,613
 I know. (Sniffs)

319
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,363
 mmm, you smell great.

320
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:04,175
Oh, god.

321
00:13:04,987 --> 00:13:07,625
I am telling you, there is something weird about renee,

322
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:10,250
and it is not just  that she's been getting in the way of my work.

323
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,863
I thought the same thing last week,

324
00:13:11,863 --> 00:13:15,237
and then things went strangely quiet around here.

325
00:13:15,237 --> 00:13:17,237
I think wilhelmina figured out I was snoopin'.

326
00:13:17,237 --> 00:13:20,238
She threw out the baby monitor I was using to listen in.

327
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,999
(singsongy) christina!

328
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:24,800
Time for a decadent foot rub.

329
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,925
(Whispers) and marc has been creepily nice ever since.

330
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:28,487
oh, go away, you wanker!

331
00:13:28,487 --> 00:13:30,487
Well, how long does wilhelmina expect you

332
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:32,816
to be on this leave of absence from "mode," anyway?

333
00:13:32,816 --> 00:13:34,269
I'm stuck in here until she's sure

334
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,862
the baby's safely on the way.

335
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:37,238
I heard on "the view" that relaxation

336
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:41,206
is good for all those baby-makin' hormones.

337
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:42,253
(Whispers) wait a minute.

338
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:47,175
m-morning sickness! Oh, oh, oh!

339
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:49,550
okay, I'll check on you later!

340
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,925
All right.

341
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:53,816
Okay, if you want me to start snooping, I will,

342
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:54,863
but you have got to get onto daniel.

343
00:13:54,863 --> 00:13:56,504
See what you can find out, okay?

344
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:57,628
Okay.

345
00:14:02,613 --> 00:14:05,425
it is just like you to choose this place afteeverything

346
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:06,629
I went through here.

347
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:08,331
Whatever are you talking about?

348
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:12,503
Oh, my.

349
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:15,550
This was gregory's favorite place, wasn't it?

350
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,675
I just realized that.

351
00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:17,925
W utterly tasteless of me.

352
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:18,893
I'll be leaving now.

353
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:20,940
No, renee. No, please sit.

354
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,363
I want to apologize for how I've acted.

355
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,112
I only had your best interests at heart.

356
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,238
You see, in the past,

357
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:35,659
daniel has cheated on his girlfriends a lot,

358
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:40,112
kind of indiscriminately, but he really seems to have changed for you.

359
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,894
You're just saying all of this because you want to start a fight with me.

360
00:14:42,894 --> 00:14:44,050
Haven't we fought enough, renee?

361
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,972
You're my sister.

362
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:45,863
I care about you.

363
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:48,738
Then why do you want me to think that daniel cheats?

364
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:50,612
 Used to cheat.

365
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:56,113
So there's really no reason for you to be worried or jealous.

366
00:14:56,113 --> 00:14:56,987
Well, I'm not worried.

367
00:14:56,987 --> 00:15:01,253
And come to think of it,what betteplace than this to toast your joyous future

368
00:15:01,253 --> 00:15:06,815
and say good-bye to all those awful memories of gregory larson.

369
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:08,363
Happy birthday.

370
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,425
 gregory... jealous... larson.

371
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:12,503
There must be a mistake.

372
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:14,190
I-I think you have the wrong table.

373
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,300
No candles. No candles.

374
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:25,300
you are a dear.

375
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,800
(Betty) daniel?

376
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:38,425
I thought it wasa little too bright in herefor your nap.

377
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:39,999
Oh, you don't have to do that.

378
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:41,737
I'm actually, uh, fine.

379
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:43,363
Oh, don't be silly.

380
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:46,988
It'll be so much better with the lights off.

381
00:15:50,562 --> 00:15:52,175
what are you doing?

382
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:54,362
Just trying to help you relax.

383
00:15:54,362 --> 00:15:58,675
I need you at your bestthis afternoon.

384
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,347
How about a massage?

385
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,487
just--just let bettytake care of everything.

386
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,237
you smell so good, daniel,

387
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:15,238
like--like muscles and power.

388
00:16:16,703 --> 00:16:17,925
I want you.

389
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,175
No!

390
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,987
I mean, maybe.

391
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,987
Um, what i think daniel is trying to sayis that he would really like

392
00:16:30,987 --> 00:16:34,238
to see some new,different layout ideas...

393
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:36,722
like, um, in an hour?

394
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:41,878
but good job. Thanks.

395
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:46,237
Did I really just fall asleepin the middle of a meeting?

396
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:48,175
Yes, but it's fine.

397
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,737
I think they thought it wassome sort of power move.

398
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:53,315
You're probably just exhausted.

399
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:54,362
You just need some rest.

400
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:57,112
No, no, no! Uh, you don't have to close the shades.

401
00:16:57,112 --> 00:16:58,940
Totally awake. I'm--I'm fine.

402
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,363
Um, okay.

403
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:06,706
Daniel,now that we're alone...

404
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:11,487
there's something that I've beenmeaning to talk to you about.

405
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:13,925
It's a little personal.

406
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:18,487
Um..how personal?

407
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:23,050
It's about...relationships?

408
00:17:24,187 --> 00:17:26,487
Just need a second, okay?

409
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:34,237
Well, I think we're safe.

410
00:17:34,237 --> 00:17:37,050
The way renee reactedto those candles,shouldn't take long.

411
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,362
Best to keep dr. Remuson speed dial.

412
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:43,253
So sad gucci doesn't makea straitjacket. 

413
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:45,863
I get no joyfrom this, marc.

414
00:17:45,956 --> 00:17:47,987
Well, that's not true.

415
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:50,863
I get a little joy,but it's tempered with sadness.

416
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:54,238
Well, you're not the onewho's guilty of mur--

417
00:17:54,782 --> 00:18:00,472
(gasps) marc,you really have to be carefulabout mentioning reneeand the "m" word.

418
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:02,706
but since the coast is clear,can I just say it once?

419
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,831
(Filtered voice) fine.

420
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:05,800
 Murder.

421
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,347
Oh, don't forget to changethe locks on my armoire,just in case.

422
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,206
Did I hear right thatyou fell asleep in a meeting?

423
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:17,894
Yeah, but, uh, it was kind ofa power move, you know?

424
00:18:17,894 --> 00:18:20,300
Okay, you know how importantthis christian siriano meetingis, right?

425
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,691
We're competing with "vogue,""bazaar" and "elle"

426
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:24,300
to get his designsin the september issue.

427
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,863
He's saidhe's only doing one. 

428
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:26,300
Seriously?

429
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,503
so he's kind of a diva.

430
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,113
I need you at your best,daniel.

431
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:31,722
And look at you.

432
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:33,347
You're all linty.

433
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,050
Here. I noticedyou were linty, too.

434
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,581
Oh, betty,you don't have to--

435
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:37,925
oh, don't worry about it.

436
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:38,862
You know I don't mind.

437
00:18:39,363 --> 00:18:45,050
So, uh, daniel,that thing I wantedto ask you about earlier--

438
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,925
it's about renee.

439
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,690
I mean, I don't know muchabout her, daniel,

440
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,690
other than she's crazy about you.

441
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,612
What time is that, uh,siriano meeting?

442
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:54,440
Oh, don't worry about it.

443
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,050
You've got plenty of time.

444
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:58,237
But seriously, daniel,

445
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,675
I mean,how much do youreally know about her?

446
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:03,112
You guys have beenmoving so fast.

447
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:04,113
Okay.

448
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,800
I'm lint-free. Thanks.

449
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,160
Are you okay?Great.

450
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,238
Uh, you know, you never reallytalk about henry anymore.

451
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:12,113
How's--how's he doing?

452
00:19:12,113 --> 00:19:16,190
Fine, I guess. Uh, I don'tget to see him that often,

453
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,487
what with all the work this week.

454
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:20,187
It's almost like you'remy boyfriend now. (Laughs)

455
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:24,628
oh, hi, christian.

456
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:25,565
Hi, christian.

457
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:28,050
Amanda, um, what would you doif someone had a crush on you,

458
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,050
and it started to affectyour ability to do work?

459
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,300
Oh, my god. I knew it.

460
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,737
Someone has a crush on me.

461
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:36,550
Is it nick pepper?

462
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,144
Because he's beenacting really weirdever since we made outthat one time.

463
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,488
No, not someonewith a crush on you.

464
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:43,300
Som-someonewith a crush on me.

465
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,112
Oh. I get it.

466
00:19:46,112 --> 00:19:47,175
Yeah.

467
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:49,863
And I am mostly over you,but I do have a rulethat if I date someone,

468
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:52,175
I get to think about themin the shower sometimes.

469
00:19:52,175 --> 00:19:54,175
I'm talking about betty.

470
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:57,237
Wait, you think bettyhas a crush on you?

471
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:00,691
(Gasps) although she ison the rocks with that hot accountantof hers.

472
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:03,612
I heard they werefighting this morning.

473
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:04,753
Wait, they're fighting? Why?

474
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:05,425
Yawn. More baby mama drama.

475
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:08,050
I guess the girlhe got all preg-nasty

476
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,503
is waitin' aroundto pop it out,

477
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:11,050
so now triple chinsis into you.

478
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,363
What am I gonna do?

479
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:14,238
Daniel,I will tell you this--

480
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:16,550
when you're lettingsomeone down,

481
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,300
it helps to besensitive to their feelings.

482
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,315
You weren't alwaysthat way with me.

483
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,941
Oh, amanda,I'm sorry. I-I--

484
00:20:24,941 --> 00:20:28,268
anyway. I just always thoughtshe'd end up with that guy gio.

485
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,863
He's so patheticallyinto her,

486
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:32,362
always up heredelivering her sandwiches.

487
00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:34,675
And give betty enough food,it's just a matter of time

488
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:36,175
before she falls in love.

489
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:37,999
Thanks, amanda.

490
00:20:38,722 --> 00:20:39,987
What was thatabout gio and betty?

491
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:42,800
Nothing. He's justtotally in love with her.

492
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,999
Oops.

493
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,441
You could do better.

494
00:20:56,362 --> 00:20:58,425
Wait, this is allabout gina gambarro?

495
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:02,362
Oh, you should've seen herwith her designer earrinand her gucci belt.

496
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,925
There wasn't an inch of her thatwasn't covered in brand names.

497
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:07,613
Okay, hilda, pleasedon't tell justin I said this,

498
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:09,738
but none of this stuffactually means anything.

499
00:21:09,738 --> 00:21:12,566
 Ay, look, all I knowis that as I'm sitting there

500
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:14,440
and she's telling meabout her great life,

501
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,675
I'm looking aroundat our little houseand my stupid salonand I'm thinking,

502
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:19,612
what do I haveto show for myself?

503
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,999
So gina marriedsome guy for money.

504
00:21:23,394 --> 00:21:24,363
So what?

505
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:29,237
 You have a wonderful son,a family that loves you.

506
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:30,707
You should notbe jealous of her.

507
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:31,999
She should be jealous of you. 

508
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,238
That's what I said.

509
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:34,999
That's why I'm here--

510
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:36,300
to make her jealous.

511
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,925
Hilda, this is not healthy.

512
00:21:37,925 --> 00:21:39,816
(Sighs) you know, you're oneto talk about jealousy,

513
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:42,441
what with charlie and henryand henry and gio.

514
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:43,363
Oh, come on.

515
00:21:43,363 --> 00:21:45,550
That is totally different.

516
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,378
Oh, that's right.

517
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:49,300
You still won't tell henrythat you're friends with giobecause that's healthy.

518
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:53,347
you know what?

519
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:54,784
I have a lot of work to do.

520
00:21:54,784 --> 00:21:55,488
Bye.

521
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,254
(lowers voice) christina, pleasetell me you found something.

522
00:21:59,254 --> 00:22:01,316

524
00:22:02,737 --> 00:22:04,425

525
00:22:04,425 --> 00:22:05,753
Wait, wait. Slow down. What?

526
00:22:05,753 --> 00:22:07,300
Wilhelmina and marchave gone out,

527
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,641
and I need helpto go through all these files.

528
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:10,519
There's just too many of them.

529
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:11,784
Why? What's in there?

530
00:22:11,784 --> 00:22:15,629
Evidence. You see, wilhelminawas talking about renee,

531
00:22:15,629 --> 00:22:18,238
and then she mentionedthe "m" word.

532
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:19,988
(Gasps) the "m" word?

533
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:21,925
Wait, there are a lot of wordsthat start with "M."

534
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,457
 Murder!

535
00:22:31,187 --> 00:22:32,472
hey, henry.

536
00:22:33,188 --> 00:22:34,237
What can I do for you?

537
00:22:36,112 --> 00:22:37,488
You can stay away from betty.

538
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:40,596
Excuse me?

539
00:22:40,596 --> 00:22:42,800
I only havefour weeks left with her.

540
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,129
I don't need to be hearingthat you're always around

541
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:47,113
with some crush.

542
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:49,613
"Crush"?

543
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:51,503
I don't know whereyou're getting that from.

544
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,487
Just stay away from her,got it?

545
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:56,363
Oh, I see.

546
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:58,675
You wanna fit.

547
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,394
All right. Well,

548
00:23:00,394 --> 00:23:01,862
let's get it over with.

549
00:23:01,862 --> 00:23:03,503
What? Wait.That's not what I meant.

550
00:23:03,503 --> 00:23:04,629
It wasn't?No.

551
00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:06,237
'Cause in my neighborhood,

552
00:23:06,237 --> 00:23:08,000
when a guy says what you just said,

553
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,237
it means he wants a fight.

554
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,847
I'll even let youhave the first punch.

555
00:23:11,847 --> 00:23:12,999
I'm not gonna hit you.

556
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:13,987
It'll make you feel better.

557
00:23:13,987 --> 00:23:14,566
Go ahead.

558
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:16,237
Take a swing, like this.

559
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,612
Son of a bitch!

560
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:22,488
I'm sorry. Oh, god.

561
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:23,550
Man, you can hit.

562
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,628
I thought you were gonna hit me.

563
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:27,610
Well, I wasn'T. I was just trying to scare you off.

564
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,753
I didn't think you were gonna actually hit me.

565
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:31,144
Yeah, neither did I.

566
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:35,800
Here.Put that on there.

567
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,113
Sit--sit down.

568
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,988
So what's up, henry?

569
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,925
Are you really mad at me, or...

570
00:23:41,925 --> 00:23:43,878
is this about something else?

571
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,863
I'm stuck.

572
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:51,316
I try to be a good boyfriend,

573
00:23:51,316 --> 00:23:53,438
and I end up not being the dad I want to be,

574
00:23:53,488 --> 00:23:56,988
and I try to be a good father,and I end up hurting betty.

575
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,862
I'm just... scared I'm gonna lose her.

576
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:10,113
You know,the one thing I don't get is,

577
00:24:10,113 --> 00:24:12,815
if you have four weeks left with her,

578
00:24:12,815 --> 00:24:16,253
then what the hell are you doing wasting your time here with me?

579
00:24:19,313 --> 00:24:22,050
Henry did what to you?

580
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,863
henry punched gio.

581
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:26,331
Really? Good for him.

582
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,238
well,what did you do to deserve it?

583
00:24:28,238 --> 00:24:29,862
Well, I'm just saying.

584
00:24:29,862 --> 00:24:31,488
But look, gio,I'm really busy.

585
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,800
I can't talk right now.Can I call you back?

586
00:24:35,238 --> 00:24:37,613
ugh. This is exactly why I didn't want to tell henry about gio.

587
00:24:37,613 --> 00:24:39,953
I knew something like this would happen.

588
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:40,800
This'll take your mind off it.

589
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,175
Come and see the dirt that wilhelmina's got on all these people--

590
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:47,050
madonna, trent lott,george clooney!

591
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,925
Oh, renee's got to be in here somewhere.

592
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:49,999
Ryan seacrest?

593
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:51,237
I don't know why she's sittin' on that.

594
00:24:51,237 --> 00:24:52,987
Someone should take him down.

595
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,050
What's this? "Rhonda slater."

596
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,613
You think maybe they're related?

597
00:24:58,613 --> 00:25:00,753
Rhonda--that is renee's real name.

598
00:25:01,078 --> 00:25:02,222
Oh, my gosh.Here, here, here.

599
00:25:02,222 --> 00:25:04,238
There's a lot of stuff here.

600
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:10,315
Hey, look at this."Stony brook professor dies in fire."

601
00:25:10,315 --> 00:25:13,175
Renee was talking to wilhelmina about stony brook.

602
00:25:13,175 --> 00:25:17,300
"Professor greg larson died in a house fire on saturday.Arson is suspected."

603
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,660
His name is larson,and he died of arson.

604
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,175
Unfortunate.It's a picture of renee with professor larson.

605
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:28,378
Ooh. They were lovers.This is gettin' good.

606
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,362
nina, I didn't realizeyou'd be coming along, too.

607
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:35,378
Well, darling,the show has me keeping an eye on christian.

608
00:25:35,378 --> 00:25:36,128
Where is he, by the way?

609
00:25:36,128 --> 00:25:37,363
Fashionably late?

610
00:25:37,363 --> 00:25:38,956
Oh, he loves to make an entrance.

611
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:41,863
Winning this contest has really gone to his head.

612
00:25:48,175 --> 00:25:49,987
The house of siriano has arrived.

613
00:25:49,987 --> 00:25:51,878
Worship me, bitches.

614
00:25:51,878 --> 00:25:53,863
Hi, mr. Siriano.Daniel meade.

615
00:25:53,863 --> 00:25:57,925
On behalf of "mode,"I'd like to sayhow fierce it isto have you here.

616
00:25:57,925 --> 00:26:01,112
Oh, okay, but no one uses that word around me. It's ov.

617
00:26:01,112 --> 00:26:03,737
Allow me to apologize for my brother. He didn't know.

618
00:26:03,737 --> 00:26:04,988
Hello, ferosha.

619
00:26:04,988 --> 00:26:08,237
You're certainly a hot tranny mess,minus the mess, of course.

620
00:26:08,237 --> 00:26:10,566
Oh, thanks, I think.

621
00:26:10,566 --> 00:26:13,612
Oh, but this placeis a bit boring. Models...

622
00:26:13,612 --> 00:26:14,285
work it.

623
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,300
You know what couldgive it some drama?

624
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,175
What the hell's going on here, daniel?

625
00:26:27,175 --> 00:26:28,738
Uh, nothing's going on.

626
00:26:28,738 --> 00:26:31,629
We're just kind of in the mile of a meeting here, sweetie.

627
00:26:31,629 --> 00:26:33,113
Yeah, I see this.

628
00:26:33,613 --> 00:26:35,237
Are these your whores?What?

629
00:26:35,237 --> 00:26:36,519
Is this your slut?No.

630
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,284
And after everything we've been through,

631
00:26:38,284 --> 00:26:41,050
I will not lose you without a fight.

632
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,362
Actually, that works.

633
00:26:43,613 --> 00:26:46,112
So renee had an affair with her professor.

634
00:26:46,112 --> 00:26:47,878
Here, look. What's this?

635
00:26:48,284 --> 00:26:49,487
Looks like commitment papers.

636
00:26:49,487 --> 00:26:51,362
For a gay wedding.Renee's a lesbian.

637
00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:55,050
christina.For a mental institution.

638
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:55,613
Look.

639
00:26:55,613 --> 00:27:01,863
"renee slater...involuntarily hospitalized...six years."

640
00:27:02,672 --> 00:27:04,737
I have never been so...

641
00:27:04,737 --> 00:27:05,941
what the hell is the matter with you?

642
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,941
I had to do something to get your attention, daniel.

643
00:27:07,941 --> 00:27:08,999
You have been avoiding me.

644
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:11,863
I have called and called,but that betty won't let me through.

645
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,488
I have been in meetings.

646
00:27:13,488 --> 00:27:16,363
Yeah, with beautiful women.You're surrounded by them.

647
00:27:16,363 --> 00:27:18,346
I know your history, daniel.

648
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,550
how many times do I have to tell you,there are no other women?

649
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:28,425
there better not be,or I swear to god,I will kill you!

650
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,925
Sometimes there's no other word--fierce.

651
00:27:42,688 --> 00:27:44,300
look, you tried to warn me.

652
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,890
I'm just afraid renee might hurt someone.

653
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,862
Oh, daniel,I'm so relieved you called.

654
00:27:49,862 --> 00:27:52,425
It must have been such a hard decision for you to make.

655
00:27:52,425 --> 00:27:53,737
call dr. Remus.

656
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:57,315
I think daniel will help the doctor over his commitment issues.

657
00:28:01,988 --> 00:28:04,909
??????????????

658
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:07,613
Didn't you say the other day that she flipped out when you tried to light a candle?

659
00:28:07,613 --> 00:28:08,753
I did.

660
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,487
One sister's a pyro,the other one's a psycho--

661
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:11,999
real winnersin this family, eh?

662
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:13,112
All right. Okay, okay, okay.

663
00:28:13,112 --> 00:28:16,862
So renee has an affair with professor larson,

664
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:22,863
he dies in a fire,and then she is hospitalized for being a jealous pyromaniac.

665
00:28:22,863 --> 00:28:25,394
Renee murdered her boyfriend.

666
00:28:25,394 --> 00:28:27,753
Daniel.

667
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:29,925
Hello, "mode" magazine.

668
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:31,581
Amanda, it's betty.I need to talk to daniel.

669
00:28:31,581 --> 00:28:34,300
Okay, betty.What is this regarding?

670
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,722
Amanda, quit screwing around.It's betty suarez.

671
00:28:37,722 --> 00:28:39,113
Oh, that is so weird.

672
00:28:39,113 --> 00:28:42,628
We have a girl who works herewith, like,the exact same name.

673
00:28:42,628 --> 00:28:43,737
You sound much prettier, though.

674
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:45,987
Look, daniel isn't answering his cell phone.

675
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:48,113
I know he's supposed to be in that meeting with christian siriano,

676
00:28:48,113 --> 00:28:49,565
but I really need to talk to him.

677
00:28:49,565 --> 00:28:51,222
I think that meeting may have ended.

678
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:52,238
What?

679
00:28:52,238 --> 00:28:52,999
Daniel already went home.

680
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:55,550
Oh, no. I scheduled him to go home and take a nap.

681
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,238
He probably turned his cell phone off.

682
00:28:56,238 --> 00:29:00,050
And he's probably exhausted from that huge fight he had

683
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,862
with his girlfriend in the middle of the meeting.

684
00:29:01,862 --> 00:29:02,769
What fight?

685
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:04,987
Well, everyone's talking about it.

686
00:29:04,987 --> 00:29:07,862
And you know what? I am all for some boyfriend stalking.

687
00:29:07,862 --> 00:29:08,440
I mean, who isn't?

688
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,425
But that woman was...crazy 

689
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:16,175
oh, no. I think renee went off the deep end.

690
00:29:16,175 --> 00:29:17,816
I have to go find daniel.

691
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:28,612
sorry I took so long,and, gina, I have to apologize for that outfit this morning.

692
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:30,640
I usually dress down for work.

693
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,300
I don't want to intimidate the clientele.

694
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,284
It's a little flashy for me.

695
00:29:35,284 --> 00:29:38,656
Is it? I have so many clothes like this,

696
00:29:38,706 --> 00:29:40,503
I guess I just don't notice.

697
00:29:40,503 --> 00:29:42,675
Shouldn't we get started?

698
00:29:42,675 --> 00:29:45,050
You can put my pradas anywhere.

699
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:48,953
this shoe doesn't look right.

700
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:51,000
Oh, you know those luxury brands.

701
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,237
Everything's handmade, so it's unique, like a snowflake.

702
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:58,188
This isn't a snowflake. It's a snow-fake.

703
00:29:58,238 --> 00:30:01,988
Excuse me?This is prada.

704
00:30:01,988 --> 00:30:05,050
 This is nada.

705
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,579
You are pathetic,with your fake-ass hair

706
00:30:07,629 --> 00:30:09,425
and your fake-ass clothes.

707
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:10,863
I bet you're not even married.

708
00:30:10,863 --> 00:30:12,332
Oh, I am so married.

709
00:30:12,332 --> 00:30:14,566
He's out parking the 5 seriesright now.

710
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:15,487
Then he isn't a doctor.

711
00:30:15,487 --> 00:30:17,175
Oh, he's a doctor all right.

712
00:30:17,175 --> 00:30:19,737
Look.That says "chiropractor."

713
00:30:19,737 --> 00:30:21,862
That's not even a real doctor.

714
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:22,363
Sorry I took so long.

715
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,754
It's, uh, hard to finda space around here.

716
00:30:24,754 --> 00:30:29,800
Honey, i want to leave.But I just found a space.

717
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,191
Yeah, why rush off?

718
00:30:31,191 --> 00:30:33,379
You and dr. Chiropractorjust got here.

719
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,925
Please?

720
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,362
I'll do whatever makes you happy.

721
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:50,987
if you get your kicks makin' my wife feel lousy,then I'm sorry.

722
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:53,238
Your life must be pretty sad.

723
00:30:56,987 --> 00:31:00,875
renee is,among other things, a borderline personality.

724
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:04,862
Without medication,she'll fixate on a personand become extremely jealous

725
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:06,750
if she thinks she's losing her hold on them.

726
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,625
That can manifest itself with violence,

727
00:31:09,675 --> 00:31:11,878
specifically,the setting of fires.

728
00:31:11,878 --> 00:31:13,722
And you're saying she killed this guy

729
00:31:13,722 --> 00:31:14,862
she was seeing--larson.

730
00:31:14,862 --> 00:31:16,863
Well, it's a bitmore complicated than that.

731
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:18,800
With my father's intervention,we were able to get renee

732
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,175
the help she neededand keep the good slater nameout of the paper.

733
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:24,297
I'm sorry.It's just, I can't believerenee would want to kill me.

734
00:31:24,347 --> 00:31:26,441
Well, technically you're right.

735
00:31:26,441 --> 00:31:29,675
Renee focuses her angeron a "gatekeeper"--

736
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:32,300
someone she thinksis keeping her from her lover.

737
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,999
Yes, yes, distinctions.

738
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:36,890
What's important is we get renee back into the asylum where she belongs.

739
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,691
Wait.

740
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:40,050
What--what did you mean,"trying to keep herfrom her lover"?

741
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:44,113
Well, in larson's case,renee was convinced his secretary wasin love with him,

742
00:31:44,113 --> 00:31:46,987
so renee started a fire,hoping to trap her.

743
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:50,363
That larson got caught in itwas just bad luck.

744
00:31:50,363 --> 00:31:52,999
As long as she's not worried about another woman,

745
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:54,363
you're fine.

746
00:31:54,688 --> 00:31:56,175
Oh, my god.

747
00:32:00,938 --> 00:32:01,687
hello?

748
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:03,800
Daniel!

749
00:32:05,437 --> 00:32:09,250
Daniel, it's betty.The door is open.

750
00:32:15,062 --> 00:32:17,112
Daniel?

751
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:24,316
I wanted to have a specl evening with daniel,

752
00:32:24,316 --> 00:32:27,862
but once again,here you are, betty,

753
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:33,909
getting in between us...just like you've been doingall along.

754
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:38,612
Daniel's mine, betty...

755
00:32:38,612 --> 00:32:40,925
and I'm not gonna let you have him.

756
00:32:41,703 --> 00:32:44,675
Renee, th-this is all a-a terrible misunderstanding.

757
00:32:44,675 --> 00:32:48,391
I see how you look at him,how you talk to him.

758
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:50,113
No. No, no. No,

759
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:53,109
I-I talk to him like this,"hi, daniel. It's betty."

760
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:54,957
See? That's normal.

761
00:32:54,957 --> 00:32:59,313
Then why are you doing everythingto keep him away from me?

762
00:32:59,363 --> 00:33:01,113
You answer his phone.

763
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:03,063
Betty,you control his appointments.

764
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:07,566
I'm his assistant.That is what assistants do.

765
00:33:11,438 --> 00:33:13,862
He sleeps  with his assistants!

766
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,750
renee,I have a boyfriend--

767
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,999
henry--who I love very, very much.

768
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,175
Then why are you spendingall of your days

769
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:28,254
and all of your nights at work with my boyfriend?

770
00:33:28,254 --> 00:33:31,237
Uh, maybe because it's, uh,it's a really busy time,

771
00:33:31,237 --> 00:33:34,875
or, uh, maybe there are some things that I don't wanna talkto henry about.

772
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:36,862
So you're lying to him?You're a liar.

773
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:41,188
 No. No.Henry is leaving for tucson,

774
00:33:41,238 --> 00:33:43,691
so I don't really want him to know about gio.

775
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:45,629
Gio? Who's gio?He's this other guy.

776
00:33:45,629 --> 00:33:46,999
Henry's a little jealous of him.

777
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:48,300
He punched him.It's complicated.

778
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,988
So you have two guys.Isn't that enough?

779
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,109
hello?Daniel, it's betty!

780
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:00,254
I'm in your apartment.

781
00:34:00,254 --> 00:34:02,441
Renee's crazy.She's trying to kill me!

782
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:04,175
Help me! Hurry!

783
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:07,113
 betty.Betty, are you still there?

784
00:34:07,113 --> 00:34:08,688
Are you all right?

785
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:10,675
she's got bettyat my apartment.

786
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:13,375
I hope you know, I prayed this day would never come,daniel.

787
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:16,175
I don't care what you have to do,you get us there faster.

788
00:34:18,063 --> 00:34:19,656
I really hopeit doesn't come to this,

789
00:34:19,706 --> 00:34:21,391
but I know some very good people

790
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:24,378
who would love  to be your assistant...

791
00:34:25,312 --> 00:34:27,394
you know,if we're too late.

792
00:34:29,972 --> 00:34:33,113
I swear to you,I don't want daniel.

793
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:38,188
And you only think I do,because of some weird little jealousy thing you've got goin' on.

794
00:34:38,238 --> 00:34:40,113
Why shouldn't I be jealous?

795
00:34:40,113 --> 00:34:41,641
He's my boyfriend, betty.

796
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:44,534
Yes.Yes, I understand that.

797
00:34:44,534 --> 00:34:46,800
See--see,my boyfriend--henry--

798
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,112
he got--gothis ex-girlfriend pregnant,

799
00:34:49,112 --> 00:34:51,612
so I spend a lot of time being really jealous of charlie.

800
00:34:51,612 --> 00:34:53,425
Charlie? There's another guy?

801
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,566
No, no, no. That's a girl.

802
00:34:54,566 --> 00:34:58,175
Stop it!Stop telling me these things.

803
00:35:08,703 --> 00:35:10,863
okay. All right.

804
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,691
Renee,you don't want to make this worse than it already is.

805
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:25,566
renee,the apartment is on fire.

806
00:35:25,847 --> 00:35:27,707
We need to get out of here.

807
00:35:27,707 --> 00:35:30,050
You are not going anywhere.

808
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:33,207
You will never take daniel away from me, ever again.

809
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:36,987
I didn't take daniel from you.

810
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:39,675
You made this all up in your head.

811
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:43,800
You are so afraid to lose him that you can't see what's real.

812
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,175
I am just his assistant.

813
00:35:46,175 --> 00:35:50,253
Daniel loves you.What?

814
00:35:50,253 --> 00:35:55,050
He loves you.You think daniel loves me?

815
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,300
Yes. He loves you.

816
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,144
I-I can--I can see it in his eyes

817
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:02,050
and the--and the way he talks about you.

818
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:06,441
Renee, it's what's real.Daniel loves you.

819
00:36:09,562 --> 00:36:12,425
I don't know what's wrong with me, betty.

820
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:15,488
Nothing makes sense anymore.

821
00:36:20,187 --> 00:36:21,362
come on.

822
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:33,628
it's bolted from the inside.

823
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,113
Oh, be a man, daniel.

824
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:51,300
you don't pay me enough.

825
00:36:54,563 --> 00:36:56,331
at least everyone made it out.

826
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:00,375
here you go.

827
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:04,456
I don't know what happened.I'm so sorry, daniel.

828
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:06,628
I really thought I was getting better.

829
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:12,925
I never meant to--I'm sorry, too.

830
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:23,863
willie, I know this must be hard--don't say anything.

831
00:37:23,863 --> 00:37:25,500
We chose our side.

832
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,190
It's over.

833
00:37:27,797 --> 00:37:29,300
There, there.

834
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,800
We're gonna get you the help you need.

835
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,222
she looked so lost afterwards,

836
00:37:58,222 --> 00:38:00,112
and then they just took her away.

837
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,562
That is so sad.

838
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:04,363
Do you think daniel's gonna be okay?

839
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:06,175
Forget daniel.Are you okay, mija?

840
00:38:06,175 --> 00:38:09,675
Yes, papi, I'm fine.I keep telling you.

841
00:38:09,675 --> 00:38:12,488
You wait till your daughtergets caught in a fire with a crazy lady,

842
00:38:12,488 --> 00:38:13,987
see if you take it this well.

843
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:18,550
Dad, she wasn't crazy.I mean, yes,she is mentally ill,

844
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:23,331
but I don't know,I sorta kinda understood her.

845
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:26,863
Just as long as you are absolutely sure you're okay.

846
00:38:26,863 --> 00:38:32,988
Dad... I am fine.I'm fine.

847
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,738
Now I have to go to work.what?

848
00:38:36,738 --> 00:38:37,878
Daniel didn't give youthe day off?

849
00:38:37,878 --> 00:38:42,175
Well, he tried,but I refused.

850
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:44,128
I really think he's gonna need a friend today.

851
00:38:47,863 --> 00:38:50,784
Betty, wait. Here. It's the stuff I took from "mode."

852
00:38:50,784 --> 00:38:53,925
Oh. Did it work?Not really.

853
00:38:53,925 --> 00:38:56,253
I mean, I told gina off,and I made her feel bad,

854
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:58,488
and that was cool, but...

855
00:38:58,488 --> 00:39:02,409
you know, she found somebody,and it seemed like they were really in love.

856
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:08,129
I wish I had that.Hilda, you will.

857
00:39:08,129 --> 00:39:15,050
And for what it's worth,gina might be in love,but she's still trash.

858
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:19,238
Betty... you always know what to say to make me feel better.

859
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:32,519
are you okay?I don't know.As long as you're okay.

860
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:34,425
Daniel...

861
00:39:35,594 --> 00:39:37,800
you know,you're gonna be fine.

862
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:43,675
You are handsome,and you're successful and kind.

863
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:47,269
You'll find someone worthy of you.

864
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:50,925
I just...I really loved her.

865
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,999
You know, amanda says I need to be more sensitive,

866
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:01,800
and she's right, so I'm not gonna talk about this in front of you.

867
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,253
I'm sorry.

868
00:40:04,562 --> 00:40:07,628
Sensitive?What do you mean?

869
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,375
Well, you know.Um, no, I don't know.

870
00:40:13,425 --> 00:40:15,425
You mean,'causeenry's leaving?

871
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:17,675
Come on, betty.

872
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,800
I know you have a crush on me.

873
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,862
What?

874
00:40:21,862 --> 00:40:23,050
