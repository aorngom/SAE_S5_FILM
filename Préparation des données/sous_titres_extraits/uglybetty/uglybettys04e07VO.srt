<i>What is going on?</i>

17
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,250
To answer that question,

18
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,700
I'm going to put "mode"
coeditor-in-chief daniel meade in...

19
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,200
the haute seat

20
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,780
Oh,daniel.

21
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,240
It's time to dish.

22
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,980
Has willie come undone?

23
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,130
Or do you feel her pain

24
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,960
After having gone through
your own recent tragedy?

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,750
"tragedy" is not in
my vocabulary,suzuki.

26
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,820
To be honest with you,

27
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,630
I feel that molly's with
me Every step of the way...

28
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,240
Supporting me,guiding my decisions.

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,720
Did she pick last month's cover?

30
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,640
Because it was heaven-sent.

31
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,670
that's really funny.

32
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,980
Seriously,just,you know,

33
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,090
I'd really like to take a second

34
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,440
To talk about something
I am really pumped about.

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,290
It's this-- this amazing organization
called The community of the phoenix.

36
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,380
Okay. Not doing an infomercial here.

37
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,400
The community teaches us to break down

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,440
the barriers Between life and death.

39
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,630
We never have to say good-bye.

40
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,890
Or do we?

41
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,370
This has been "the
haute seat" with--

42
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,090
see,with the wings of the
phoenix on our backs...

43
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,910
we can accomplish anything,suzuki.

44
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,810
Both of us! Stand up. Stand up.

45
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,840
- Come on,stand up.
- I don't want to.

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,880
<i>- Say it. Anything. Anything.
- What is he do-- whoa!</i>

47
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,090
<i>Come on,say it! Anything! Come on,buddy!</i>

48
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,660
<i>You're stretching my turtleneck!</i>

49
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,960
- Hey,natalie,is daniel around?
- Nope.

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,270
Okay. Well,I just want to talk to him

51
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,020
About the interview he did this morning!

52
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,000
He's super busy today, But I'll
be sure to let him know,okay? Bye.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,740
Okay,thanks.

54
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,820
Clogs,willie?

55
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,650
You were wearing clogs.

56
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,990
- They're very comfortable.
- Stopt! Stop it.

57
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,540
Ami am sorry about connor,

58
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,600
But have you lost your
mind? Listen to you.

59
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,360
You're talking about comfortable shoes.

60
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,900
Has the world gone mad?!

61
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,120
Everything is not about fashion,marc.

62
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,450
I will let that slide Because
we both know I deserv it.

63
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,280
Willie,our futures are tied together.

64
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,820
<i>Think of us.</i>

65
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,170
You're n ger gonna get another job

66
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,920
wearing Syntheti gardening footwear!

67
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,070
Marc,do you think I haven't tried?

68
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,990
I've already prostrated myself
before the mummified remains

69
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,690
Of claire meade and
begged for my job back.

70
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,750
- And?
- She said no.

71
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,440
At least,I think she said no.

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,020
When she opened her mouth,a
cloud of dust came out.

73
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,540
So if you'll excuse me,I
need to find another way

74
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,100
To save my daughter's ass.

75
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,190
- hey,mandy.
- No time.

76
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,250
Have to get to the big editor's powwow.

77
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,910
Matt asked me to take notes
so he doesn't miss anything.

78
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,470
Again? Where has he been all week?

79
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,960
Um,location scouting in the bahamas.

80
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,020
But now he's back,

81
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,540
but he had to go to
the doctor this morning.

82
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,240
He strained something during tennis.

83
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,040
Hope it wasn't a groin muscle.

84
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,280
Put some ice on it,woman.

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,780
Marc,he respects me.

86
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,910
He asked me to stay late

87
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,140
Every day last week to
go over fashion layouts.

88
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,300
Mandy,that's not respect. It's
called "I'm out of my league.

89
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,240
<i>I don't know What the hell I'm
doing. Please do my job for me.</i>

90
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,900
" you say
po-tah-to.

91
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,360
Anyway,I've decided to ask matt out.

92
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,770
Really? What about betty?

93
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,070
I thought you weren't
going the full hartley

94
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,450
Because the furry one
still had feelings for him.

95
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,640
Well,I wasn't.

96
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,000
But then I talked to betty about it,

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,340
and she said E's totally over
him,so I got the green light.

98
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,300
And in case that conversation
happened in my head,

99
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,420
Betty's not gonna know about it

100
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,350
'cause I'm gonna date him in secret.

101
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,390
- Hi,furry.
- Hi,marc.

102
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,280
Daniel.

103
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,980
So I saw the suzuki interview

104
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,880
And I really don't thinkit was .

105
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,560
The beard's working for you.

106
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,910
Oh,thank you,betty.

107
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,640
But maybe we can tell them you
were on allergy medication--

108
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,980
You kn find a way to spin it.

109
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,360
Spin it? Why would we need to spin it?

110
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,850
You were great. I was so proud of you,

111
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,070
Spreading the word about the community.

112
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,070
You were awesome.

113
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,240
I don't think "awesome" is the
word Most people are gonna use--

114
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,530
isn't it time to get
the meeting started?

115
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,270
Mm,absolutely. Let's rock and roll.

116
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,450
And you-- you can
sit right next to me.

117
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,380
Daniel,he's staying?

118
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,290
Yeah,of course. And he
brought some friends.

119
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,050
okay,people,We're shooting
this issue in the bahamas,

120
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,550
So let's not hold anything back,okay?

121
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,960
Let's keep our minds focused

122
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,970
And our pitches free of
any negatronic energy.

123
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,610
Betty,please,kick it
off for us,would you?

124
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,630
Sure.

125
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,010
Okay,a
fun fact--

126
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:09,840
The bahamas used to be
a notorious pirate haven.

127
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,060
In fact,they were home To two of
the only known female pirates--

128
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,300
Anne bonny and mary read.

129
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,740
So since this is the "fearless"
issue,I was thinking we could...

130
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,650
Shoot the models dressed like
pirates,Plundering booty...

131
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,050
But also showing booty.

132
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,090
Uh,betty,Didn't pirates kill people?

133
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,750
Well,yeah. They also had scurvy,

134
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,870
But I didn't think we'd focus on that.

135
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,340
You know,more so the bandanas
and the hoop earrings.

136
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,640
I am getting a lot of
negative energy off this idea,

137
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,750
And we wouldn't want it to
toxify this whole meeting.

138
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,600
So what else have you got,hmm?

139
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,670
Come on,betty.

140
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,840
I think you'd find it altogether...

141
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,080
Daniel.

142
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,190
Daniel.

143
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,040
I assumed it was just me he
was cutting out of his life.

144
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,980
It all started when he hired

145
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,900
That girl natalie to be his assistant.

146
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,030
Then came the community meetings,

147
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,290
The counseling sessions,the phasing.

148
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,530
And now they're telling him What he
can and cannot put in his own magazine.

149
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,790
Well,there's a name for people
Who take over your life that way,

150
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,940
Who make all your decisions for you,

151
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,070
Who cut you off from all the
people who care about you.

152
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,890
It's called a cult.

153
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,450
I need to talk to him.

154
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,300
I don't care that I'm not in
the right phase or whatever!

155
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,370
I'm gonna find out what's going on.

156
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,730
mrs.Meade.

157
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,940
Big fat package for you.

158
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,230
Thank you,amanda.

159
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,660
south***

160
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,160
Oh,poor baby!

161
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,000
Let me help you. Does it hurt?

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,660
Oh,it's nothing. I just went
for it,diving after a serve.

163
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,260
Were you super sweaty and pantg?

164
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,560
Not really. Actually,it
was video game tennis.

165
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,990
You know,where you stand
in front of the screen

166
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,040
And wave the thing around?

167
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,940
It's actually a really good
workout. You should try it sometime.

168
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,220
I'm game. Tomorrow night,my place.

169
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,480
What?

170
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,500
Oh,I just figured since
you're recuperating,

171
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,560
Maybe I could make you dinner.

172
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,560
Are you asking me a date?

173
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,420
Who said anything about a date?

174
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,370
We are just two single,attracti
people having dinner,

175
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,820
Who may or may not have to
get up early in the moing.

176
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,440
A friendly dinner sounds nice.

177
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,690
I'll see you tomorrow.

178
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,730
daniel.

179
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,830
Betty?

180
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,280
What the hell are you doing here?

181
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,590
I didn't have a choice.

182
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,350
I've been trying to talk to you all day,

183
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,140
But natalie and bennett won't
let me anywhere near you.

184
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,430
okay,look. Maybe they're a
little... overprotective of me.

185
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,370
It's only because they're
looking out for me.

186
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,620
Looking out for you,

187
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,120
As in,running your editorial meetings

188
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,580
And cutting you off from your family

189
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,680
And everybody who cares about you?

190
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,890
bennett was right.
You'll never understand.

191
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,590
I'm trying to understand,daniel.

192
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,440
Ou think I'd be staking
out the men's room,

193
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,420
Listening to strange
guys go to the throom

194
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,230
If I didn't want to understand?

195
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,750
The copier repair guy was
in here for 20 minutes!

196
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,060
Betty,please.

197
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,140
Daniel,we're friends.

198
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,880
Why can't you just tell me
what you're going through?

199
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,870
Look... I'm sorry.

200
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,520
It's just something
you have to experience.

201
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,400
You're right.

202
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,670
I haven't experienced it,so...

203
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,000
It's not fair for me to judge something

204
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,880
That seems to be helping you.

205
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,540
What if I did an article on it?

206
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,580
- An article?
- Why not?

207
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,850
I could do a profile on
bennett and the community--

208
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,680
Get an insider's perspective.

209
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,040
Then I could understand why
this is so important to you.

210
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,390
Everybody could.

211
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,920
It would be great
exposure for the community.

212
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,310
I spoke to daniel.

213
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,880
- And?
- He called bennett.

214
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,430
He's giving
meotal access--

215
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,700
A "mode" exclusive inside
the community of the phoenix.

216
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,240
We're in.

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,720
Hi. I'm betty suarez.

221
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,370
I'm here to see bennett wallis.

222
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,260
Miss suarez...

223
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,840
We've been expecting you.

224
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,970
Thank you.

225
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,510
Thank you for agreeing to do the story.

226
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,970
Miss suarez,You are being given
an extraordinary opportunity.

227
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:57,150
No outsider has ever seen
What you are aboo to see.

228
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:02,980
And once you do,I can't be
responsible for what may happen.

229
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,660
I'm just messing with you. I'm sorry.

230
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,740
People think we're into
all kinds of crazy stuff.

231
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,180
Come on up. Let me show
you around. Come on.

232
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,890
Can I get you some phoenix water?

233
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,620
No,thanks.

234
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,090
I've already made your
travel arrangements.

235
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,750
Coach,I'm afraid.

236
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,620
But I'm sure you'll understand
given the circumstances.

237
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,520
You're sending me to venezuela?

238
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,290
I know people there
that'll keep you safe.

239
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,640
What the hell am I
supposed to do in venezuela?

240
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,310
I don't know,nico.

241
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:40,670
Work on your tan,Hone
your socialist manifesto,

242
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,030
Stay out ofsprison.

243
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,650
But we had a plan.
Pay off castelar--

244
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,990
Pay him off with what?

245
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,600
Connor is dead. There is no money.

246
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,300
But I can't leave you.

247
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,330
Even if I go,they'll
still come after you.

248
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,160
I'll be fine,sweetheart.

249
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,000
Please,mother.

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,300
Maybe I can talk to
him,work something out.

251
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,380
I am not gonna set up a
payment plan with a blackmailer.

252
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,860
So unless you have another idea,

253
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,490
I suggest you go home and start packing.

254
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,150
Your flight leaves first
thing in the morning.

255
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,690
We appreciate the opportunity
to set the record straight.

256
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,210
Most people hear about the community,

257
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,260
And they think we're some kind of cult.

258
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,240
Well,isn't that understandable?

259
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,150
I mean,a lot of what you
say is really... Very...

260
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,400
Kooky?

261
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,160
Is it kooky to help
people get off drugs,

262
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,400
Get off ste streets,turn
their lives around?

263
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,140
What'I going on over here?

264
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,260
Just more of our good work.

265
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,590
Great. I'd love to see it.
I want to see all of it.

266
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,200
And I wish you could,

267
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,000
But that room is for
level 7 members only.

268
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,040
No one else can enter.
I'm sure you understand.

269
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,410
Well,I'm trying to understand.
That's why I'm here.

270
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,230
I-I'm trying to help everyone
Understand more about the community.

271
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,090
Really?

272
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,640
I thought it was because you're
afraid you're losing daniel,

273
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,650
That we're taking your
friend away from you.

274
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:16,010
Nope. I assure you,I
am here for the article.

275
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,320
Please. I understand.

276
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,680
It's painful to lose
someone you're close to,

277
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,420
- Like your mother?
- Excuse me?

278
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,890
Your mother. You lost her,didn't you?

279
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,770
How do you know about my mother?

280
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,770
It must have been devastating for you.

281
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,060
Of course it was devastating.

282
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,420
How do you know about my mother?

283
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,310
I can tell you miss her so much.

284
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,290
You think about
her every day--

285
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,110
W--uh,no,not
every day.

286
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,430
Okay,I think that's enough.

287
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,140
Maybe you're at work
or riding the subway.

288
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,610
Suddenly,you realize
you can't even remember

289
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,460
The last time you thought about her.

290
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,950
Every day,she's becoming more
and more difficult to see,

291
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,450
And you hate yourself
for letting that happen,

292
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,770
Don't you?

293
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,960
Just letting her slip away.

294
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,550
We don't let that happen here.

295
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,300
.Ah. I'll be right there.

296
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,530
I'mrterr sly sor,miss suarez,

297
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,010
we're gonna have to reschedule.

298
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,350
Colin here will show you the way out.

299
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,660
I've enjoyed this immensely.

300
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,790
No.

301
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,090
Derisive laughter.

302
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,930
I'm intrigued.

303
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,930

304
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,050
Gimme that!

305
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,270
<i>Shame.</i>

306
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,650
laundry day.

307
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,860
Prada help me.

308
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,080
Oh,my god.

309
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,670
oh,I don't want to know this!

310
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,450
Look,I've tried everything.

311
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,580
She says there's no money.

312
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,240
You believe that? She's just
trying to get my price down.

313
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,200
She's a ugh bitch,you know that.

314
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,100
I think she means it.

315
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,370
You want this to work out,don't you?

316
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,660
Of course I do...

317
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,990
Detectivstcastelar.

318
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,760
betty?

319
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,680
Well,what did you find out?

320
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,060
Not much.

321
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,470
Bennett was answering my questions

322
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,460
- And telling me abt their programs.
- That's good.

323
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,590
Well,that's what I thought,

324
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,790
Until he started talking about me...

325
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,540
And that I had lost my mother.

326
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,810
Well,that's what con men do,betty.

327
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,640
- They prey on the vulnerable.
- You think he's a con man?

328
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,030
Come with me.

329
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,600
I need your help.

330
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,120
You said you knew daniel's password.

331
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,670
And I do,but I don't know

332
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,290
if I'm comfortable Hacking
into his bank account.

333
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,670
Betty,this man bennett wants something,

334
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,040
And I guarantee you,it's
not daniel's soul.

335
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,300
Okay.

336
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,840
We're in.

337
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,360
What'd you find?

338
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,420
Nothing. You guys have a lot of money.

339
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,920
Would you just see if there
are any large transfers?

340
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,280
Okay.

341
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,670
I'm not an accountant,But
this all looks really normal.

342
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,620
What's going on?

343
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,350
Nothing.

344
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,570
What are you doing in my office?

345
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,120
Okay,and swing!

346
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,320
- Shoot!
- No,no. Don't worry. You're doing great.

347
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,310
Okay,we need to get you in a
little better position here.

348
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,820
Let's move your hips
more towards the tv.

349
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,530
- Higher.
- Uh,what?

350
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,730
Or you could go lower.

351
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,450
Either way works for me.

352
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,730
I think this is fine.

353
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,470
And swing!

354
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,060
Okay,keep your eye on the ball.

355
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,060
Oh,oh,by the way,thanks
for covering for me

356
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,370
In the meeting this morning.

357
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,040
Oh,no problem.

358
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,890
Although,it got kind of crazy.

359
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,460
Daniel invited all of his
flight of the phoenix friends.

360
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,880
Really? To the meeting?

361
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,750
Yeah. It was all about
phasing this and phasing that.

362
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,150
It was a little too "star trek" for me.

363
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,940
Oh,come on!

364
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,200
Okay,that was on the
line. This thing's a liar.

365
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,550
Wait,phasing. Who was
talking about phasing?

366
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,660
Daniel. Ohand bennett,he's
the head guy,the big bird.

367
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,940
Bennett? Bennett wallis?

368
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,620
Yeah. Do you know him?

369
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,440
I mean,this is really--
this is unbelievable.

370
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,710
You're actually breaking into
my office,gog through my files.

371
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,240
What choice did you give me?

372
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,930
You're cuttie me out of your life.

373
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,260
You cut me out of yours.

374
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,960
Sleeping with hartley behind my back?

375
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,210
Cal is trying to save this company,

376
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,180
Not hand it over to
a bunch of crackpots.

377
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,850
These crackpots have helped me

378
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,080
Through the most difficult time life.

379
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,500
Daniel...

380
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,910
If they're helping you,then we're happy.

381
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,300
But don't forget that
we're here for you.

382
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,210
We just don't want you to shut us out.

383
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,760
- hello.
- Bennett,it's natalie.

384
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,720
I'm worried about daniel.

385
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,140
Molly and I were barely getting started,

386
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,510
And she was taken away from me.

387
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,380
And at level 5,I
caught a glimpse of her.

388
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,220
Now tonight I am going to level 7.

389
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,390
And when I do,bennett
says I can be with her

390
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,880
whenever I want for as long as I want.

391
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,020
I know you think we don't
underdand What you're going through,

392
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,300
and you're probably right.

393
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,180
But listen to yourself.

394
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,160
You're gonna be with molly?

395
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,850
That doesn't make any sense.

396
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,950
No,you're right. This is
something we need to talk through.

397
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,690
I'm gonna go get a drink of water.

398
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,700
We can discusss. this

399
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,370
what are we gonna do?

400
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,140
I don't know.

401
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,940
- yes?
- Oh,uh,hi,uh,mrs. Meade,it's matt hartley.

402
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,030
I need to speak with daniel About this
man he's been talking to,bennett wallis.

403
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,870
- What about him?
- Hi,betty.

404
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,540
Um,remember,Uh,the time iold
you that I moved to canada?

405
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,900
Yeah,you wanted to be a mountie.
What's that got to d with bennett?

406
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,750
Well,when I wp up there, I got
hooked up With this self-help group,

407
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,030
The brotherhood of the northern lights.

408
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,970
It was run by bennett wallis.

409
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,160
What exactly did this brotherhood do?

410
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,900
Some pretty crazy stuff.

411
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,320
But their big thing is
that they promise people

412
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,200
That they could talk
toirheir dead loved ones.

413
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,590
They'd give tememsps s
ecial tha a at they said

414
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,320
helpe "b ring down the veil
betwe this world andndex n nt."

415
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,670
They-- they
drugged you?

416
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,850
Uh,no,not me.

417
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,040
I only made it to level 2.

418
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,920
But by the time you make it to l 7el 7,

419
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,240
They have you on some
pretty strong stuff.

420
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,900
It gottty scary.

421
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,760
Someone died.

422
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,660
Oh,my god.

423
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,650
Where's daniel?

424
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,120
Daniel,we need to talk.

425
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,410
- Daniel.
- Daniel!

426
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,740
you're sure he's in there?

427
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,670
Yeah,he's one of their
celebrity members. Around him.

428
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,130
Celebrity members?

429
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,050
Bennett was always looking for
high-profile people That he could rope in.

430
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,080
I mean,that's why he wanted me. He
was basically trying to get to my dad.

431
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,280
They're getting everything
they want from daniel.

432
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,970
People are probably joining the
community in droves Because of him.

433
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,710
What?

434
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,500
Not that I don't
appreciate the help,amanda,

435
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,370
But what are you doing here?

436
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,360
Um,I was in that cult
for,like,five minutes last week,

437
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,550
So I know how they operate.

438
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,040
And when the shirt hits the flan,
You're gonna want me on your team,suarez.

439
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,810
Can we focus,please?

440
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,940
How are we going to
get daniel out of there?

441
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,050
Well,I'm sorry. I don't know
if I'm gonna be much help.

442
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,820
Bennett and I left on pretty bad terms.

443
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,620
I was banished for life.

444
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,430
Do you know what would happen If
I even showed my face in there?

445
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,380
What?

446
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,480
Get your hands off me! All right?

447
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,690
Do you know iho I am?

448
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:10,890
Oh,okay. All right,watch
the thumb. Watch the thumb.

449
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,690
willie! Willie!

450
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,910
I have to tell you something.

451
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,120
What is it,marc?

452
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,270
Nico and castelar...

453
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,340
for god sakes,spit it out.

454
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,250
Are you wearing my shoes?

455
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,140
Mother,what's going on?

456
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,620
Marc just brought me some
rather troubling information.

457
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,940
- I saw you.
- What?

458
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,760
On the street,canoodling with castelar.

459
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,710
Tell me this is not true,nico.

460
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,650
It's true.

461
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,250
You were going to send me away

462
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,630
To live with cousins
I've never even met.

463
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,450
And I had to come up
with some other way,

464
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,170
So,yes,I went to castelar.

465
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:09,320
I tried to bargain with
him,get him to take less.

466
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,460
What I saw looked awfully
cozy for a negotiation.

467
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:20,860
he said he would take
less,But only if...

468
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,120
I was willing to...

469
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,460
Offer him something to sweeten the deal.

470
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,900
I tried to go through with it,mother,

471
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,910
Because I didn't want to leave you.

472
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,110
But I couldn't.

473
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,670
I'm so sorry.

474
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,240
You don't actually believe
this load of horse apples.

475
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,910
Willie?

476
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,920
- Get out. - Willie,you
can't possibly--

477
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,630
Get out of my house,marc.

478
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,220
let's go! I said watch the thumb!

479
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,020
This place is a labyrinth.

480
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,540
Are you sure this is the right way?

481
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,580
I think it's just right up here,level 7.

482
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,340
Sme smell of crazy's getting stronger.

483
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,220
right this way. come
on. Come on. Come on.

484
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,160
No.

485
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,150
here we are.

486
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,390
Are you here for the session?

487
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,390
Absolutely.

488
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,000
And we're really pumped to be here.

489
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,470
That's good,though most
people aren't "really pumped"

490
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,560
To be in grief counseling.

491
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,510
What she means by "pumped"
is Pumped full of emotion

492
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,210
that she has no idea
how to deal with,As am I.

493
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,930
That seems like a good place to start.

494
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,230
Why don't you tell us about your loss?

495
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,870
- Amanda,we should be going.
- My mother died.

496
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,080
Amanda.

497
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,350
I never even knew her.

498
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,070
She put me up for adoption.

499
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,820
Just when I figured out
who she was,she was gone.

500
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,200
How did it happen?

501
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,230
- A terrible accident.
- She murdered her.

502
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,430
Not everyone who starts this journey

503
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,620
Is strong enough to finish it.

504
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,120
You two have proven that you are.

505
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,200
- Do you want to be with robbie?
- Yeah.

506
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,210
Are you ready to be with molly?

507
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,800
I am.

508
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,000
It's a lot stronger than before,huh?

509
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,830
You said you were ready.

510
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,900
I hope I haven't
misplaced my faith in you.

511
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,350
Daniel!

512
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:59,370
- No,you have the wrong address.
- Ooh,sorry.

513
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,530
I-it's okay. Continue.

514
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,630
I always knew that I
was born to fashion.

515
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,230
I mean,this...

516
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:21,320
Is not just some off-the-rack
sperm and egg collision.

517
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,490
You know,it's-- it's
destined. It's genetical.

518
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,630
So when I found out that
fey sommers was my mother--

519
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,700
This fashion
icon--

520
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,850
my life finally made sense.

521
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,220
But then it was all taken away.

522
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,970
I'm so very sorry.

523
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,330
I think fey would be
very proud of your...

524
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,310
Fashion sense.

525
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,220
I'm not mad that you murdered her.

526
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,550
I'm just mad that you murdered her

527
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,460
Before I had a chance
to get to know her.

528
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,470
Guys,we gotta go.

529
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,160
You're sure he wasn't there.

530
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,410
I checked every other room on the floor.

531
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,450
we have to think. Where
would they have taken him?

532
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,080
hey,matt. Where are you?

533
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,290
Um,I'm in jail-- trespassing
and disturbing the peace.

534
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,850
- Wait,jail?
- Here.

535
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,000
Matt,he wasn't in there.

536
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,520
wait,what? What do you mean,he
wasn't there? Where else could he be?

537
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,620
I don't know. I'm not the cult
expert-- you are. You tell me.

538
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,140
Okay,okay. Uh,uh...

539
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,680
Well,the whole point of level 7 is that

540
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,040
you make this Total connection with
the person that you're trying to reach,

541
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,350
So you surround yourself
with their things,

542
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,560
Uh,touch their
clothes,smell their perfume.

543
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,800
He never packed up molly's apartment.

544
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,300
molly's apartment! He's
at molly's apartment.

545
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,540
You guys are just gonna
leave matt in jail?

546
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,600
We don't have time. We
gotta get to daniel. Come on.

547
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,450
On my team,you never leave a man behind.

548
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,910
Whatever. Uh,brooklyn,please.

549
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,260
Could either of you
spare some bail money?

550
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,300
I'm so sorry,sweetheart.

551
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,410
I never should've
tried to send you away.

552
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,000
But what are we going to do now?

553
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,230
You said we were out of options.

554
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,930
maybe not.

555
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,850
36...

556
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,090
24... 36.

557
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,290
My measurements.

558
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,510
It's a family heirloom.

559
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,640
I think it's worth more than
enough to satisfy castelar.

560
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,550
You've had this all along?

561
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,630
Why didn't you say anything before?

562
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,260
It's the one thing I
vowed I'd never sell.

563
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,340
And there's only one thing more
important to me In this world.

564
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,240
I have a few loose ends to tie
up At the office tomorrow morning,

565
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,000
But I'll be back by 10:00,

566
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,160
And then we'll take the necklace
And head straight to the airport.

567
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,480
We'll stick together
and get through this.

568
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,490
No matter what.

569
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,380
Can you feel her,daniel?

570
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,150
Can you feel molly's presence?

571
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,810
No,um... I'm not sure.

572
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:30,090
Focus. Feel their
energy. Draw them to you.

573
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,510
I'm trying. I just,uh,I
really-- I don't think it's...

574
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,700
<i>daniel.</i>

575
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,270
Molly?

576
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,090
You're here.

577
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,640
<i>Yes,daniel,I'm here.</i>

578
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,200
I can't believe this
is you. This is amazing!

579
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,060
- Daniel! - I-I-I
can't allow you in here.

580
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,240
They're in a very delicate state.

581
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,660
You'll be in a delicate
state if you don't step aside.

582
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,580
<i>I am on to you. I know who you are.</i>

583
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,730
And if you've done
anything to harm my son,

584
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:10,740
I will sue your ass
right out of this world.

585
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,090
Yeah!

586
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,350
- Now,l-- - don't
even think about it!

587
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,840
Molly,I missed you so much.

588
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,040
<i>I know.I've missed you,too.</i>

589
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,680
But we can be together now.

590
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,990
I mean,we can be together forever.

591
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,780
- That's all I ever wanted.
- Me,too.

592
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,210
Oh,I can't believe you're here!

593
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,700
Daniel...

594
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,610
<i>Remember when I told you I
never wanted you to forget me?</i>

595
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,190
And I never,ever will.

596
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,010
<i>But you have to.</i>

597
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,050
<i>Just a little bit.</i>

598
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,340
What are you talking about?

599
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,420
<i>This isn't real,daniel.I'm gone.</i>

600
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,460
<i>And you can't live your
life pretending that I'm not.</i>

601
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,100
you have to let her go.

602
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,180
Daniel,you have to let her go.

603
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,140
Wait,who's "her"?

604
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,480
Molly,I-I did this for you,

605
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,040
To--to be
with you.

606
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,460
Daniel...

607
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,840
<i>Let molly</i>

608
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,340
Why are you calling yourself "molly"?

609
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,950
Stop! Okay?

610
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,060
- Let her go.
- I can't.

611
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,160
I never got to say good-bye.

612
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,800
<i>Then say it now.</i>

613
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,760
<i>I'm right here.</i>

614
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,510
<i>Say good-bye to me.</i>

615
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,160
Good-bye,m. Lly.

616
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,810
daniel.

617
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,320
betty?

618
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,310
Mom?

619
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,530
Darling,are you all right?

620
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,420
Are you okay?

621
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,710
Daniel,stay with us.
Son,are you all right?

622
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,840
Can you hear me,daniel?

623
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,980
Daniel,are you sure you're okay?

624
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,580
I'm fine.

625
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,200
I still think we should
go to the hospital.

626
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,990
natalie,wait.

627
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,160
Look,you don't have to go with him.

628
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,780
Just because you're giving
up,don't expect me to.

629
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,940
- Listen to me.
- We were supposed to do this together.

630
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,390
- I know.
- I can't see robbie unless you are with me.

631
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,560
Bennett
said--

632
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,280
Bennett has been using you to get to me.

633
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,950
Oh,so... So it's all about you?

634
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,630
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Robbie was there!

635
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,330
It's not real.

636
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,150
Bennett's been drugging us.

637
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,220
I saw your face...

638
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,990
How happy you were.

639
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,880
Tell me that wasn't real.

640
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,700
Natalie,please.

641
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,500
You have to say good-bye to robbie.

642
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,550
You can get on with your life.

643
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,310
I thought it was you that was
gonna help me get there,but...

644
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,180
I guess it has to be someone else.

645
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,840
Here,let me help you.

646
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,260
Thank you.

647
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,000
- Open... - Uh,you t have
to feed me. It's-- okay.

648
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,250
I feel like a dork.

649
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,010
Why? 'cause I'm feeding
you like a baby? Big bite.

650
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,900
Um,no. Because I got rown in
jail,and you had to bail me out.

651
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,020
Whatever. You totally saved the day.

652
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,010
We never would've found
daniel without you.

653
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,470
You're kind of my hero. Incoming...

654
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,110
But we never got
to finish our date--

655
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,890
Dinner. Friendly dinner.

656
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,920
Can I make it up to you?

657
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,070
I think I can squeeze you in.

658
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,920
amanda?

659
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,780
I just wanted to say how glad I am

660
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,510
We were able to clear
some things up last night.

661
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,360
me,too.

662
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,230
I took "you've reached the office
of the murderer" Off your voice mail.

663
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,970
Well,I appreciate that.

664
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,330
He was a beautiful baby.

665
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,840
- Excuse me?
- Your son--

666
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,150
the one you put up for adoption.

667
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

668
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,690
You think a personal
and confidential letter

669
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,330
From the south dakota department
of child services Crosses my desk,

670
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,580
<i>And I'm not gonna steam it open?</i>

671
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,490
Call him.

672
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,920
This is claire meade.

673
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,430
I'd like to book a flight From new
york to rapid city,south dakota.

674
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,480
I prayed I wouldn't find you here.

675
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,800
- I was just getting everything ready for our trip.
- Oh,please don't.

676
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,840
Do me that one final courtesy.

677
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,750
All right.

678
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,790
There never was a murder,was there?

679
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,670
No blackmailing detective.

680
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,470
Just like there wasn't any plan
for us to run away together.

681
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,160
Yes,there was a plan.

682
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,640
You just showed up an hour early.

683
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,920
So who's your partner in crime,nico?

684
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,640
Wait,let me-- let me
guess. Uh,castelar? Oh,no.

685
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,150
Castelar is really your "dead"
boyfriend jonathan,isn't he?

686
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,040
Why,nico?

687
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,840
What did I do to deserve this?

688
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,760
<i>What did you do?</i>

689
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,220
Where do I even start?

690
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,660
How about sending me away

691
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,120
Because you were too
busy with your career

692
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,110
To even give a damn about me?

693
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,980
How many times did I even
see you,growing up,mother?

694
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,650
How many holidays did we spend together?

695
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,190
Are you surprised? Really?

696
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,800
I mean,I thought-- I
thought you'd be proud of me.

697
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:47,300
'cause after all you did to screw me up,

698
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,610
I'm still my mother's daughter.

699
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,020
get out.

700
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,850
I never want to see you... Again.

701
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,260
You'll get what you want,mom.

702
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,560
You always do.

703
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,950
Donate or a keeper?

704
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,620
That was actually molly's "Sunday
morning new york times" Coffee

705
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,380
and,uh,croissant t-shirt.

706
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,670
So it's a keeper.

707
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,920
No,you can pitch it out. It's fine.

708
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,510
You know,daniel,just 'cause
you're saying good-bye

709
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,730
Doesn't mean you have
to get rid of everything.

710
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,870
Well,yeah,I can't hang
on to everything either.

711
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,840
It's just a crappy old t-shirt.

712
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,340
Well,it doesn't matter if it's valuable.

713
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,190
It's about what it means to you.

714
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,960
Like my necklace.

715
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,150
The pearls aren't real,It
doesn't go with everything I wear,

716
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:04,740
But my mom gave it to
me,so it was a keeper.

717
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,890
All right,I'll put it in the keep pile.

718
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,450
Uh,I-- you know,I meant to ask you
Something about the other night.

719
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:22,760
Remember when I was kind
of off in level-7 land

720
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,250
And I thought I was
kissing molly good-bye

721
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:30,280
And I kind of woke up and
you were Standing right there,

722
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,240
sort of in front of me?

723
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,240
Uh,did... Did we...

724
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,260

725
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:43,360
Sort of. I mean,you kissed
me around the eyebrow.

726
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,410
I'm a lot shorter than molly.

727
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,960
Oh,okay.

728
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,910

729
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,390
Ugh,what about these?

730
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,260
Oh,get rid of them,please.

731
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,800

732
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,960

733
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,900
