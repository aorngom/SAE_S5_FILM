they keep us locked in a
room,making us paint rocks

it's been three weeks. hmm.

88
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,710

me out of here sometime.

89
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,620

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,590

100
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,550

<i>and by god,that little eyelid fluttered.</i>

120
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,340
<i>that's our girl.</i>

121
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,580
she is not your girl!

122
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,880
that is my family,do you hear me?

123
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,370

124
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,740
oh,no,she can't,

125
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,570
but everybody else in montauk can.

126
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,840
- yoga,where have you been?
- i went for a walk on the beach.

127
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,020
then i copped us some blueberries

128
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,610
from the farmers market.

129
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,200

130
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,860

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,220
- sure do beat that crack house in the bronx.

132
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,550
mitsy sacks will be back
from barcelona in the fall,

133
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,830
and i don't think she'll take too kindly

134
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,470
- to having escaped convicts hiding out in her home.
-  just as long as we still hanging

135
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,540
for candy bergen's
end-of-the-summer barbecue

136
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,440
'cause everybody was talking about that

137
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,720
- at the clambake last night.
- we are fugitives. you're going to get us caught.

138
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,850
you the one everybody recognize.

139
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,690
folks just see me up in here,

140
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,990
they think i'm the maid or gayle king.

141
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,480
oh,shoot. i almost forgot.

142
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,770

143
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,790
i don't want any more damn shells!

144
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,450
i want to see my children.

145
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,710
i want my husband back,

146
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,170
but that damn bitch won't
let him out her sight.

147
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,650
she's moved into my house,

148
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,340

149
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,570

00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,180
you front page still,baby.

151
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,360
what if i wear a disguise?

152
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,230
mitsy throws a big
halloween party every year.

153
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,080
she has a closet full
of costumes upstairs.

154
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,700
you got a date on that party?

155
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,150
'cause i already got
uma's hayride that week.

156
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,540
oh,my god. mmm.

157
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,810
guessed who just showered
a mere 7 inches away

158
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,630
from mr. emilio estevez
at the gym this morning.

159
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,620
i am telling you-steam,a
little soap in your eyes...

160
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,880
st. elmo's still on fire.

161
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,760
mmm. what is that on
the corner of your mouth?

162
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,240
lip liner.

163
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,680
don't you lie to me,missy.

164
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,220
you've taken a lover,

165
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,760
and that lover has a creamy center.

166
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,920
just leave me alone.

167
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,490
mandy... you're binging...

168
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,790
and gaining weight by the minute.

169
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,720
stop staring at me!

170
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,990
i didn't stop when emilio
asked,and i won't stop now.

171
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,900
listen to me. i know you're stressed

172
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,570
about this whole birth
certificate thing. shh!

173
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,810
but you're starting to look
like two fat girls hugging.

174
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,460
just bite the bullet and
confront your parents.

175
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,000
what if it's true?

176
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,470
what if fey sommers is really my mother?

177
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,060
but at least you'll know the truth

178
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,850
and let the healing begin,

179
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,850
and by "healing," i
mean a 3-day f flush.

180
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,830
i haven'gained that much.

181
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,300
you can't even notice.
"mode" magazine,please hold.

182
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,180
morning,mark,betty.

183
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,250
i'm calling them. i'm calling them!

184
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,440
ew.

185
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,120
- good morning. - oh,betty,i'm so glad
you're here. big toe-please scratch.

186
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,400
okay.

187
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,040
oh,yeah,that's it.
oh,i'll never forget this.

188
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,130
this is not what i want
to be remembered for.

189
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,040
so when are they coming to
unhook you from this thing?

190
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,840
- actually,i don't think i'll be getting out
of here today. - what? but the doctor said-

191
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,890
you want to listen the doctor

192
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,690
or the guy who smashed into
a tree going 80 miles an hour?

193
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,590
- i am still in a lot of pain here,betty.
- well,i can see that.

194
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,790
you've taken the pain pill
every time they've offered it.

195
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,840
you know,daniel,you may
just want to pass on the pill

196
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,590
- and see how you're feeling. - yeah,that
whole feeling part-not really interested.

197
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,540
all right,i get it. so how's alexis?

198
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,630
there's no change.

199
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,690
mm. i was in with her all morning.

200
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,280
you know,i've been doing
a lot of internet research,

201
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,300
- and they say you really should talk to coma victims.
-  betty,i'm doing everything i can.

202
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,560
i know. i'm sorry.

203
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,680
????

204
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,580
you know wilhelmina-

205
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,020
jumping in with both
claws,running with it.

206
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,070
oh,that reminds me. here are my notes

207
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,010
on the features and the tahiti shoot.

208
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,600
make sure wilhelmina incorporates them.

209
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,960
????

210
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,520
after all,everything i do here

211
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,540
is in service of daniel's vision.

212
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,240
well,thank you very much,wilhelmina.

213
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,870
i will tell him you said that.

214
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,890
all right,sheila. the
victoria's secret shoot-

215
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,670
we have two double-page
spreads in november. go.

216
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,910
okay. the concept is "what is sexy?"

217
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,800
adriana and alessandra are booked,

218
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,330
and we've put a pin in
st. barths or coney island,

219
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,420
depending on the budget.

220
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,690
and who's shooting? peter?

221
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,100
i slept with peter. trust
me,he doesn't know what sexy is.

222
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,720
i was thinking warren.

223
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,060
he made kate moss look
like a man. get owen.

224
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,230
done. by the way...

225
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,500
i'm wearing the "very sexy"
push-up bra they sent over.

226
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,440
i've never felt hotter.

227
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,770
save the ass kissing
for the clients,sheila.

228
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,630
all right,features.

229
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,580
i'm moving the london
designers to the front.

230
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,750
tell health and fitness they
get six pages instead of eight,

231
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,090
and i'm still not happy
with european getaways.

232
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,780
congratulations,phillip. you've
managed to make paris boring.

233
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,550
get me a new draft
by the end of the day.

234
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,940
all right,people,gear up

235
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,740
for the natural disasters shoot today,

236
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,590
so sparkle and dazzle.

237
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,580
mm.

238
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,610
it's beautiful,isn't it?

239
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,700
mm. our best october yet.you've outdone

240
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,630
mm. and for what?

241
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,740
this magazine will never be mine.

242
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,660
claire owns "mode," and
she'll never give it up.

243
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,250
who cares? in a few weeks,

244
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,750
you'll be marrying old man liver spots

245
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,950
and all the rest of meade publications

246
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,780
will be yours. mm. if she
doesn't screw that up for me,too.

247
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,690
she's out there somewhere.

248
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,580
i just have to make sure

249
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,610
she does not make any
contact with bradford

250
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,990
before i get that ring on my finger. mm.

251
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,140
where are you,you gin-soaked hag?

252
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,320
come out,come out,wherever you are.

253
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,870
okay,the victoria's
secret stuff's good to go.

254
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,970
ooh. ooh. the leopard print baby doll.

255
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,050
<i>hello,mrs. matt damon.</i>

256
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,990
are you doing that "mrs.
matt damon" thing again?

257
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,910
i'd like to give him a "bourne ultimatum."
listen,do you have the test shots

258
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,410
for the natural disasters
makeover shoot today?

259
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,440
i want to show 'em to daniel.

260
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,810
right here. oh,amazing. tse
women have lost everything.

261
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,090
wilhelmina thinks a
mani-pedi and a new weave

262
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,440
is gonna change their lives. oh,and
who said fashion doesn't care?

263
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,980
still on for lunch? that was lunch. i
have to go. gotta meet my dad's lawyer.

264
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,310
gotta do some grocery shopping.

265
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,080
gotta get a sandwich to
the hospital for daniel

266
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,780
because they're serving
fish,and he hates it.

267
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,210
then i gotta be back here for the photo shoot
at 3:00. betty,you can't keep going at this pace.

268
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,970
i'm fine. no,you're not,look at you.

269
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,750
you're rushing around after
everybody else. what about you?

270
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,780
have you even called henry? it's
been three weeks. oh,christina,please.

271
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,080
look,i don't have time
to think about henry,

272
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,490
not with santos and daniel and alexis

273
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,560
and-and my dad still stuck in mexico.

274
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,220
i don't have time to worry
about little boyfriend problems,

275
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,710
which isn't even a problem
because he's not here.

276
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,320
he's in tucson with
his pregnant girlfriend.

277
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,560
end of story. but m-maybe
the baby's not his.

278
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,620
and maybe it is,

279
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,880
and the best thing that i
can do to take care of myself

280
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,680
is to not think about him at
all. betty,i just don't want you-

281
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,560
christina,enough! i cannot let
myself be distracted by henry.

282
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,290
i need to look straight ahead. (thu

283
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,920
oh,betty.

284
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,770

290
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,100
this is it
- the house of lies.

291
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,640
mother!

293
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,150
amanda?

294
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:37,060
wh-what are you doing out here
in the middle of the afternoon?

295
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,700
and overweight?

296
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,820
who's overweight? amanda!

297
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,320
hi,kitten. you didn't call.

298
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,730
what are you doing here?

299
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,120
i waed to talk to you both now,

300
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,090
while i've got my nerve.

301
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,220
i don't think you two have
been very honest with me.

302
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,570
what are you talking about?
we tell you everything.

303
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,490
actually,i think there's
one very big secret

304
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,710
you haven't told me about.

305
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,930
what secrets? we don't have
any secrets in this house. no.

306
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,620
yoo-hoo! did someone forget about us?

307
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,790
we were getting lonely.

308
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,550
uh,this is our
daughter a-a-amanda

309
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,920
and her friend marc,

310
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,410
and this is,um,bob and elaine klein.

311
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,040
they're our new,uh,internet friends.

312
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,010
it's a very funny story.
see,they came over to play tennis.

313
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,540
and wouldn't you know
it,the sprinklers went off?

314
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,110
that's right. that's right. it was...

315
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,430
they're just waiting
for their clothes to dry.

316
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,030
you know what?

317
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,560
we're,uh,we're gonna go wait.

318
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,910
for our clothes to dry.

319
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,930
now what's all this
crazy talk about secrets?

320
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,860
you know what? i
- i can't do this. never mind.

321
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,850
- amanda.
- i can't.

322
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,310
- you have to.
- i can't!

323
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,500
amanda found a birth certificate

324
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,340
that said that fey sommers
was her real mother.

325
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,440
ugh. this is taking forever.

326
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,300
i just have so much to do
today. you don't understand.

327
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,820
daniel cannot eat hospital fish.

328
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,340
okay,ms. suarez.

329
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,410
uh,it doesn't appear
to be a concussion...

330
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,200
see?

331
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,790
but i am a tad concerned

332
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,450
about your heart rate
and blood pressure.

333
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,390
really? he said a "tad."
a tad isn't serious,right?

334
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,230
could be nothing,could
be stress related.

335
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,990
now are you under lot of
pressure right now? yes.

336
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,140
<i>no. no.</i>

337
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,080
well,you might want to think
about slowing down a bit.

338
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,190
now leave that patch on
until the swelling's gone,

339
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:34,140
and i'll be back in a minute with a
prescription. okay. thank you very much,doctor.

340
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,840
well,i hope you take
his warning seriously

341
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,380
and maybe start to slow down just a little bit
- oh,no! it's 12:00! i'm late for my dad's lawyer.

342
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,940
will you stay for the prescription?

343
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,980
please,please,please,please,please.

344
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,080
and tell them i'll be there
on time for the photo shoot.

345
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,350
excuse me!

346
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,320
we're so sorry we never told you,honey.

347
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,510
fey never wanted you to know.

348
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,440
i can't believe this.

349
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,170
i'm adopted.

350
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,590
how?

351
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,560
well,when your father
worked for fey,you know,

352
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,770
handling her accounts,she
found out she was pregnant.

353
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,420
she wouldn't even tell
us who the father was.

354
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,100
honey,all fey ever wanted was a career.

355
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,940
she knew she could never
give you the love you needed.

356
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,820
and since we couldn't have kids on our
own... your father has lethargic sperm.

357
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,870
is that really an important
part of the story,rosemary?

358
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,060
so you've been lying
to me all these years?

359
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,240
i'm not here. just
looking for some more wine.

360
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,010
amanda,adopted or not,

361
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,930
- weoved you from the moment we held you in our arms.
-  you're still our little girl.

362
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,130
no,i'm not! i'm fey's and
some guy we don't even know.

363
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,160
i don't think i'll ever be able
to trust you two ever again!

364
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,970
it was really nice seeing you again.

365
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,760
your home is beautiful.

366
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,650
hey.

367
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,830
hey! you leave my sister alone.

368
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,240
you want a photo of a meade in trouble?

369
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,440
here i am,you son of a bitch!

370
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,610
mr. meade,this is i.c.u.

371
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,780
any change at all today?

372
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,460
her vitals are the same.

373
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,150
mr. meade,are you sure you
don't want to go in and see her?

374
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,300
it just seems like you want to.

375
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,810
you come this far every day,

376
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,840
and you look at her through the window.

377
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,930
i can't. no,i think,um,i
need my medication.

378
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,680
it's been four hours.

379
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,920
you know,you go through life
thinking you're one person,

380
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,290
and then boom,just like
that,the slate is wiped clean.

381
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,460
i mean,who am i?

382
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,640
- you are fey sommers' daughter.
- yeah,but what does that even mean?

383
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,070
she's just a woman who
walked by my desk for years,

384
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,510
and she never even looked
at me,and now she's gone.

385
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,200
maybe if we can find out
who your real father is...

386
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,870
how? he could be anybody.

387
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,800
true. your mother was
a hoochie in a bob.

388
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,050
mm.

389
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,480
if bradford is my father,

390
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,760
that makes daniel my brother...

391
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,250
who i slept with... a lot,

392
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,600
and that's the kind of
dirty that don't wash clean.

393
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,010
<i>okay,first of all,he'd
be your half brother.</i>

394
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,440
already a little better,right?

395
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,220
and second,i gotta say,kinda hot.

396
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,290
it's incest.

397
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,570
okay,before you get all
"flowers in the attic" on me,

398
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,600
let's first find out if
bradford really is your dad.

399
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,840
and how are we gonna do that?

400
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,270
invite him to father's day brunch

401
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,270
and see if he shows up?

402
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:20,100
no,sarcasma. three words-d.n.a.

403
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,550
dad,i'm so sorry.

404
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,690
i was only ten minutes
late to the lawyer's office,

405
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,790
but he still wouldn't see me.
so i made another appointment.

406
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,760
<i>mija,relax. i'm fine here.</i>

407
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,870
although it wouldn't
kill your cheap aunt

408
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,390
to turn on the air conditioning every
now and then! well,are you eating enough?

409
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,510
are you taking your medication? oh!

410
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,020
oh,i'm sorry. no peripheral vision.

411
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,160
stop worrying about me.

412
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,550
it just kills me that i'm so far away.

413
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,660
i know.

414
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,170
but you'll be home
soon,so just have faith.

415
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,320
<i>te quiero.</i>

416
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,140
<i>te quiero.</i>

417
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,010
<i>s? i mean,hello></i>

418
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,990
is this betty suarez? yeah.

419
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,870
this is lisa lapera,justin's
camp counselor.

420
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,710
i just wanted to let you
know,your nephew just took off.

421
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,110
what do you mean,he just took off?

422
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,850
apparently,the indian dream
catchers we were making

423
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,450
were "amateurish" and
"culturally insensitive."

424
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,660
he threw a hissy fit and
said he was going home,

425
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,770
and i'm not sure,but i think
he stole a bottle of glitter.

426
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,180
and we need that back
or a check for $1.99.

427
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,970
justin wouldn't...

428
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,500
hello?

429
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,360
ugh.

430
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,180
this is not happening.

431
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,140
<i>no!</i>

432
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,980
damn,the hooker had her baby kidnapped,

433
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,870
now she has tetanus?
that's a pretty bad monday.

434
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,430
okay,december 15th is
the latest we can go

435
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,510
with the new wedding date.

436
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,920
otherwise people try to combine

437
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,910
your wedding gift with
your christmas gift,

438
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,220
and that is not gonna happen.

439
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,580
you sure you wanna wait till december?

440
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,370
i mean,didn't this teach us anything?

441
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,870
gotta live for today.
what are you trying to say?

442
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,320
let's elope.

443
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,710
elope? yeah.

444
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,110
oh. no,seriously,you,me,we'll
grab justin.

445
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,190
we'll go down to city hall this weekend.

446
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,690
besides,my dad would die if
he doesn't get to give me away.

447
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,170
i guess it would be pretty rough...

448
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,500
to miss you walking down the
aisle in your wedding dress.

449
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,680
you think it's all right
that i'm wearing white,right?

450
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,940
why don't you show me the dress?

451
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,850
no way! that is bad luck!

452
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,470
i just got shot. how much
worse can my luck get?

453
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,280
come on,mama.

454
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,160
oh... dad-ford!

455
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,230
i mean,bradford.

456
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,020
i mean,mr. meade!

457
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,890
i sufferrom severe cotton mouth.

458
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,900
would you mind licking this for me?

459
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,400
i beg your pardon?

460
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,910
lick this for me.

461
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,820
amanda,you don't have
to lick these. see?

462
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,760
thank you,betty. you're welcome.

463
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,520
hey,what's different about you?

464
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,960
did you ge your hair cut?

465
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,030
i'm wearing an eye patch.

466
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,780
you didn't always have that?

467
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,550
those are pink gerber daisies.

468
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,740
hey,look at that! they're for you.

469
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,140
i think they came a few weeks ago.

470
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,890
well,why didn't you give them
to me? you know what,betty?

471
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,090
i have had a lot on my
mind these last few weeks.

472
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,980
amanda! it might be hard to believe,

473
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,660
but pretty girls have problems,too.

474
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,790
thinking of you

475
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,820
all right, ladies of natural disasters,

476
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,330
and do say "ladies" and not "victims,"

477
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,480
because there isn't a victim among you.

478
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,880
you've all survived horrible tragedies

479
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,100
and now "mode" is going
to make you beautiful.

480
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,180
sheila,talk to me.

481
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,760
okay,just like on
the storyboards--

482
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,090
we're gonna show them
at their absolute worst--

483
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,550
ravaged by hurricanes, floods,fires...

484
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,550
sad,sad,sad.

485
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,970
and then we do the "afters."
happy,sexy,blown out. i love it.

486
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,010
we change their lives and,uh,
showcase the fall collections.

487
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,440
mm-hmm. just make sure the
skinny ones are up front.

488
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,920
(sheila) "famine," makeup. now.

489
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,580
bless your heart.

490
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,490
what disaster are you, honey? mudslide?

491
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,060
what?

492
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,470
no,i'm not a victim. i'm fine.

493
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,790
i just need some food. my
blood sugar's a little low.

494
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,280
uh-huh. looking good,"flood."

495
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,840
excuse me, are there any more bagels?

496
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,190
i don't see any more bagels. uh,no!

497
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,640
you can have mine.

498
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,900
no,no,no,no,no.

499
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,320
i'm not gonna take a bagel from
"famine." you need to eat,too.

500
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,860
give me sofi of th

501
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,930
it's just that there is nobody here

502
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,820
who cares about filling the inside.

503
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,340
they only care about fixing the outside!

504
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,030
what's stumpy up to now?

505
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,310
you know what? this concealer here,

506
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,730
this isn't gonna change the fact
that she doesn't have a house!

507
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,490
and--and this,
this eyeliner,

508
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,180
this isn't gonna bring back
the people that you loved!

509
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,750
these women have lost everything!

510
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:40,110
and there is not enough styling gel

511
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,280
in here to change that!

512
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,070
you know what? she's right.

513
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,370
we don't have enough styling gel.

514
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,330
oh,excuse me,mr. meade!

515
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,580
hi,i have some mail here for you.

516
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:10,900
ow!

517
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,100
oh,my god,a paper cut!
here,let me swab you.

518
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,360
no,thank you.

519
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,670
- ????
- ????

520
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,520
hit me again.

521
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,760
you sure? it's your third one.

522
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:27,250
i know my limit. this
time chili cheese fries.

523
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,430
betty?

524
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,940
daniel?

525
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,580
why aren't you in the hospital?

526
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,090
well,i had a few... dozen
calls about the photo shoot.

527
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,290
i thought you might need a friend.

528
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,260
fry?

529
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,410
i was thinking with the leopard,

530
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,170
we could add
this belt-- n!

531
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,840
i don't have the energy
to say "no" anymore.

532
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,940
what about this boa?

533
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,190
n!

534
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,120
what about this
brooch? we can--

535
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,880
why don't you just
stick the pin in my eye?

536
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,740
what is the matter with you people?

537
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,860
we might as well be
publishing "field & stream"

538
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,270
because apparently no one in this room

539
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,970
knows a thing about fashion!

540
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,520
(justin whispers) loose the belt.

541
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,480
is it just me,

542
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,570
or does anyone else see
the little fashion elf?

543
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,500
i'm sorry. i just think it's too busy.

544
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,950
like coco chanel always says,

545
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,670
"when accessorizing"...

546
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,060
"always take off..."
"always take off..."

547
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,550
"the last thing you put on."
"the last thing you put on."

548
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,490
you've got the gift.

549
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,550
phone call!

550
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,140
i'm in the middle of a
run-through. take a message.

551
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,960
it's "schmaire schmeade."

552
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,200
(lowers voice) claire
meade? (lowers voice) yes.

553
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,290
(normal voice) everyone out!

554
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,960
(normal voice) go,go. get.
get out of here. go. go. go.

555
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,450
get out! ace the call.

556
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,780
what? how? i don't know. figure it out.

557
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,660
triangulate the signal.

558
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,850
hello,is this no one's most wanted?

559
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,700
oh,bite me,wilhelmina.

560
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,210
i wanna talk to you about bradford.

561
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,250
you mean my fianc?

562
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,530
you're not in love with him.

563
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,750
oh,claire, you're so wrong.

564
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,470
i'm madly in love with
him. as a matter of fact,

565
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,630
i'm staring at our wedding
invitations as we speak.

566
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,410
do you love him more than "mode"?

567
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,130
i know the magazine is what
you've wanted all along.

568
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,350
and i'm the only person
who can give it to you.

569
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,490
keep talking.

570
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,640
leave bradford,and i will
sign "mode" over to you.

571
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,640
"wilhelmina slater--
editor-in-chief."

572
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,510
are you salivating yet?

573
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,570
no.

574
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,630
meet me at the bow bridge in
central park tonight at 8:00.

575
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,930
i'll be dressed as a nun.

576
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,400
or a cat. i haven't decided yet.

577
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,850
have the documents ready,

578
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,640
and i will sign "mode" over to you.

579
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,250
8:00.

580
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,060
i couldn't do it.

581
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,180
i couldn't triangulate the signal.

582
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,070
i don't even know what triangulate
means! don't worry,marc.

583
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:17,390
i think all our problems
will be taken care of.

584
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,420
how'd you find me?

585
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,370
it's no secret

586
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,360
you turn to potatoes in times of need.

587
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,550
it helps.

588
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,020
look,daniel, i'm really sorry

589
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,900
if i screwed up the photo shoot.

590
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,910
i just--i think this
whole thing with henry--

591
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
it finally got to me.

592
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,820
and i shouldn't have let it.

593
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,790
after everything that's
happened to my family

594
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,830
and to you...

595
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,490
he's just a guy,right?

596
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,990
he's a guy you loved.

597
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,600
you know what? i have an idea.

598
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,870
go back the office.

599
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,050
there are some things you're
gonna need to get for tonight.

600
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,400
what's tonight?

601
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,440
we're going to a funeral.

602
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,860
sir?

603
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,260
i don't mean to disturb you.

604
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,290
may i speak to you privately?

605
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,800
it's about wilhelmina. what about her?

606
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,950
as you know,i'm privy to
many of her conversations,

607
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,460
both professional... and personal.

608
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,010
she has issues with you.

609
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,750
issues?

610
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,630
ear hair.

611
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,040
i didn't realize i had any.

612
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,450
perhaps others have tried to tell you,

613
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,340
<i>but you couldn't hear
through all the ear hair.</i>

614
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,130
she would never, in a million years,

615
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:45,890
bring this up.

616
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,490
so i thought,as someone
rooting for the relationship,

617
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,400
i might spare you
both the embarrassment.

618
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,040
may i clip you,sir?

619
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,550
never send a girl to do a woman's job.

620
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,710
mm.

621
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,770
ah.

622
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,220
don't you think this
is a little weird...

623
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,010
and illegal?

624
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,150
yeah, it's both those things.

625
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,470
it's also symbolic. henry's gone.

626
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,560
if you're gonna move on,

627
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,940
you have to put him to rest, right?

628
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,830
okay, i just hit something soft!

629
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,450
ah! oh,i'm sorry.

630
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,550
are you okay?  all
right, what are you gonna bury first?

631
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,670
um,well...

632
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,580
i could start with these.

633
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,840
this is from our first meal together.

634
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,450
sushi.

635
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,440
it was good... getting to know him.

636
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,510
the raw eel? not so much.

637
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,300
low sodium.

638
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,110
he was always looking out for me.

639
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,190
man,you brought a lot of stuff.

640
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,730
uh,we may need a bigger hole.

641
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,350
yo,how you doing in there?

642
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,720
okay,you ready?

643
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,440
damn.

644
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,270
you like it? i was
gonna take it in a bit,

645
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,740
maybe cut the top a little bit lower.

646
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,730
no,no,no,don't do anything.
don't touch it. it's beautiful.

647
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,330
just like you.

648
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,700
okay,so now you've seen the dress.

649
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,310
<i>papi... i want something from you.</i>

650
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,720
oh,come on,baby,you know
what the doctor said.

651
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,350
i need at least a month.

652
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,670
(laughs) no,not that.

653
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,390
i wanna hear your vows.

654
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,060
now?

655
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,300
i knew it.

656
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,350
i knew you didn't write them!

657
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,120
you had two months!

658
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,720
you are so not seeing
the honeymoon lingerieow.

659
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,660
give me my jeans.

660
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,540
reach into the back pocket. go ahead.

661
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,970
you feel stupid?

662
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,450
a little bit.

663
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,100
mm-hmm.

664
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,000
say your prayers,bitch.

665
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,220
bradford!

666
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,800
i knew i could count on you
working late on thursdays.

667
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:41,320
we don't have much time.
wilhelmina is in the park.

668
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,980
is she?

669
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:48,000
you ain't wilhelmina slater. no,i'm
not even sure what i'm doing here

670
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,950
or why i'm wearing this outfit.

671
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,820
please don't hurt me. (pants)

672
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:56,190
did you really think
i'd fall for your offer?

673
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,140
i knew you'd never take "mode"
away from your own children.

674
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,370
but that's all right.

675
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,350
i may not have "mode,"

676
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,440
but very soon i will
have everything else,

677
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,140
including your husband.

678
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,860
oh...

679
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,120
listen to me go on and on.

680
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,960
i'm so rude. sit down. you're the guest.

681
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,330
let me,uh, fix you a drink.

682
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,590
though you'll probably
have to down it quickly,

683
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,460
because the police will be
here in,um... three minutes.

684
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,290
i only need one.

685
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,760
and this is the crown he
gave me at the middle ages.

686
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,150
(snores) are you sleeping?

687
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,100
no.

688
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,040
(clears throat) that
was a silent prayer.

689
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,440
i was just...

690
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:51,990
so moved by the paper clips he gave you.

691
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,730
this is good-bye for him and you.

692
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,920
any final words?

693
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,610
okay,well...

694
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,480
here...

695
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,890
near the place where
it all came to an end,

696
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,710
lies the remnants of a relationship

697
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,780
that almost, but never quite was.

698
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,730
"it started good, really good.

699
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,230
"and then it got bad...

700
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,130
"mainly 'cause of me.

701
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,800
"i took her for granted,

702
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,450
"never realizing she
was everything i needed.

703
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:40,010
"she was always there...

704
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,890
right in front of me."

705
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,250
i hoped for so much.

706
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,230
i had a fantasy.

707
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,180
we were together.

708
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,410
we were building a life.

709
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,260
"it took me ten years...

710
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,270
"but i'm glad i finally
came to my senses...

711
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,260
before the most special
thing in my life..."

712
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,300
was gone...

713
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,330
for good.

714
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,840
* comfort is my solitude i embrace *

715
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,810
i loved you,henry.

716
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,890
"i love you,hilda."

717
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,510
* i will rise from my sorrow

718
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,530
* i wilmyrise froorrow *

719
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,000
* i will rise from my sorrow

720
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,340
how do you feel?

721
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,910
i don't know. uh,better,i guess.

722
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,460
maybe now i can start fresh.

723
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,900
what's that? are you in pain?

724
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,510
no,i
just--i...

725
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,690
i need a fresh start,too.

726
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,980
you okay?

727
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,810
not really.

728
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,410
there's something i didn't tell you.

729
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,740
the reason we were in the accident...

730
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,580
why my sister is in the coma...

731
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,960
i was high.

732
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,290
she was rushing me
to the rehab hospital.

733
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,520
it was my fault.

734
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,440
you know,i don't know if i'm ever...

735
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:17,290
gonna be able to get over the guilt.

736
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,590
but i can get over these.

737
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,180
good-bye,henry.

738
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,940
oh,it was horrible!
the next thing i know,

739
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,640
sister mary gang member
threw me to the ground

740
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,310
and took my wallet. marc,i
am in serious trouble.

741
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,180
you? i don't think i'll
ever be able to watch

742
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,510
"the sound of music" again!

743
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
claire's not going away easily.

744
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,840
and apparently she's got friends.

745
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,240
i need protection.

746
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:24,500
hi.

747
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,990
it's me...

748
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,600
daniel.

749
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,150
sorry i didn't come by... sooner.

750
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,520
i just didn't think i could
handle seeing you like this.

751
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,670
you were always the rock, right?

752
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,780
the strong one.

753
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,990
oh,my god!

754
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,450
i'm so sorry,alexis.

755
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,780
this should be me.

756
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:07,010
(strained voice) oh,i'm thirsty.

757
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,230
nurse! nurse!

758
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,270
alexis,can you hear me?

759
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,560
yeah,daniel, i can hear you.

760
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,400
alexis,i...

761
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,100
i can't believe this.

762
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,780
why do you keep calling me alexis?

763
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,930
what?

764
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,200
it's me.

765
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,970
alex.

766
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:36,900
hi.

767
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,390
hi.

768
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,900
so i heard there was
a little fashion elf

769
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,760
spreading the word of coco
chanel around "mode" today.

770
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,870
i'm sorry,aunt betty. i had to get away.

771
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,320
that's okay.

772
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,790
but as far as
tomorrow goes--

773
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,070
i know,back to camp.

774
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,140
actually,i think you were
meant for greater things

775
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:58,180
than macaroni necklaces,justin,
so i talked to daniel,

776
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,380
and it looks like we're gonna
need an intern around the office

777
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,440
for the next couple of
weeks before school starts.

778
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,550
oh,my god! oh,my god!

779
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,460

thank you. thank you.

782
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,630

784
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,910

was gonna stand up there

785
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,680
in front of everybody and just wing it?

786
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,340
