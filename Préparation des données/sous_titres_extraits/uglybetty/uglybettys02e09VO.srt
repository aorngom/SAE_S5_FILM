00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
????

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,190
Betty???

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,670
And You Betrayed Me. You're Fired.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,240
????

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,090
Please Don't Hurt Me. I'm Not Fighting You!

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:14,870
Daniel! Alexis!

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,000
Betty,Can You Please Stay With My Dad?

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,890
Betty,I Need You To Do Something For Me.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,680
Take Care Of Daniel.

10
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,120
Mr. Meade? (Monitor Emitting Continuous Tone)

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,760
(Woman) Excuse Me. We Need To Get Through. (Man) Watch Your Back.

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,980
(Woman) Excuse Us. There's No Pulse.

13
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,090
Aah!

00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,690
Mr. Meade,

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,500
Y-You're Dead...

17
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,490
And In My Refrigerator.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,260
<I>A Box Of Baking Soda</I>  <I>Wouldn't Hurt In Here.</I>

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,890
Okay.

20
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,800
Okay. You Deserve This.

21
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,350
You Eat Empanadas At 2:00 A.M.,

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,890
You See A Ghost.

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,840
Counting One,

24
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,790
Two...

25
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,670
Three.

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,910
Ghost Gone.

27
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,080
This Calls For Another Empanada.

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,040
<I>I'm Not A Ghost,</I>  <I>Betty.</I>

29
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,110
<I>I'm A Subconscious</I>  <I>Manifestation Of Your Guilt.</I>

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,960
My Guilt Wears Island Casual?

31
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,490
<I>I Didn't Pick It.</I>  <I>You Did.</I> I Guess You Were Always A Little Too Formal.

32
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,580
Anyway,Why Are You Here? I'm Not Guilty Of Anything.

33
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,350
<I>Really? You Promised Me</I>  <I>On My Deathbed</I>

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,750
<I>That You Would</I>  <I>Take Care Of Daniel.</I>

35
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,390
<I>Then You Didn't Take</I>  <I>Your Job Back.</I>

36
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,920
<I>Deathbed--It Doesn't Get</I>  <I>Any Bigger Than That.</I>

37
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,600
Okay,Maybe I Am A Little Guilty.

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,750
But I Can't Go Back To "Mode."

39
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,290
It Changes Me Too Much.

40
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,890
And I'm Still Daniel's Friend.

41
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,460
I'm Still Gonna Be There For Him.

42
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,330
<I>I Hope So.</I>

43
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,870
Look,I Promise,Okay?

44
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,440
So Can You Disappear So I Can Go Back To D?

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,310
<I>By Bed,You Mean</I>  <I>Finish These Empanadas?</I>

46
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,000
Damn You,

47
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,610
Subconscious Manifestation Of My Guilt.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<I> Te Amo!</I>

49
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,300
Okay,I Got The Christmas Ornaments And The Garland.

50
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,520
The Lights Are Still Up In My Room From When

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,990
I Turned My Closet Into A Nightclub. Sweetie,We're Not Decorating The Tree Today.

52
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,530
We Do It This Day Every Year. Don't Worry,Justin.

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,450
We're Still Trimming The Tree Today. Well,I Thought With Mr. Meade's Funeral,

54
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,620
You Wouldn't Want To. No,We Have To. It's Mom's Tradition.

55
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,680
Yeah. Grandpa,Help Me Set Up The Nativity Scene. Forget It.

56
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,840
Mary,What Happened To Your Hair?

57
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,930
So You Think Maybe, Once Things Calm Down,

58
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,450
You're Gonna Go Back To Working At "Mode"? No,I Can't.

59
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,180
Look,I've Been Thinking About Mom A Lot Lately,

60
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,740
With The Funeral And The Holidays Coming.

61
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,120
I Just Don't Think She Would Be Happy

62
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,020
With The Person I Was Becoming At "Mode."

63
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,010
Okay,But I Think She'd Be Happier If You Quit

64
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,370
After You Got Your Christmas Bonus!

65
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,470
Isn't This Plot Kind Of Big For Just Dad?

66
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,720
It's Not Just Dad. It's For All Of Us.

67
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,090
You Know, The Family Plot.

68
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,950
Wait,What? Since When Do We Have A Family Plot?

69
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,510
Since Forever. Oh,Wait.

70
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,660
I Think You Were At Boarding School

71
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,980
When Dad Bought It. Did You Not Think I Was Coming Back?

72
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,180
I Mean,No One Thought To Tell Me,

73
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,420
"Oh,Daniel,We Took Care Of Your Final Resting Place"?

74
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,580
I Guess We Forgot. It Was Morbid. (Scoffs)

75
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,170
Look At Daniel. He Just Looks So Upset.

76
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,670
Yeah. Are We Getting Paid For Today?

77
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,110
Christina, We're At A Funeral. Yeah,All Right.

78
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,900
It's Just That The Memo Made It Sound Like It Was Mandatory.

79
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,260
And Where's Henry? How Did He Get Out Of This?

80
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,490
Well,He's At The Office. The Issue Ships Tonight,

81
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,550
And All The Accounts Have To Close By The End Of The Day.

82
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,720
What,So You're Telling Me He's Getting Time And A Half?

83
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,060
Hey,Sheila. Great.

84
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,270
Sheila,Who Do You Think's Gonna Take Over Meade Publications

85
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,440
Now That Bradford's Gone?

86
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,980
Mean,I Am Fey Sommers' Daughter.

87
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,510
You Think It Could Be Me? Probably.

88
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,460
I'm Sure Your Two Years As A Receptionist

89
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,150
Qualifies You To Run The Whole Company. I Know,Right?

90
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,590
(Police Siren Wails) Oh,Men In Uniform.

91
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,410
Marc's Gonna Be So Pissed He Missed This.

92
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,580
Must You Manhandle Me? I'm In Mourning Here.

93
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,400
This Is My Husband's Funeral.

94
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,440
Allow Me Some Dignity.

95
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,690
Hi,Mom.

96
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,630
Hi. How Are You?

97
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,210
As We Lay My Father To Rest,

98
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,790
In This Apparently Secret Family Plot,

99
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,470
I Am Reminded

100
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,340
That He Leaves Behind

101
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,570
Some Big Shoes To Fill.

102
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,340
Alexis And I Will Make Sure His Legacy Lives On.

103
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,620
Now If... (Clears Throat)

104
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,640
Anyone Else Would Like To Say Something...

105
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,940
(Low Voice) No. No,No,No. Ple-Please.

106
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,000
It's Nearly Over.

107
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,420
Hi,I'm Betty Suarez,

108
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,760
Um,And I-I Just Want To Say Something

109
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,330
On Behalf Of All The Employees

110
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,570
Who Worked For Mr. Meade.

111
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,260
He Didn't Spend A Lot Of Time Talking To Us,

112
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,760
And There Was A Time

113
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,100
Where He Thought My Name Was Betsy--

114
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,090
But I Do Know That He Loved His Family,

115
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,960
And He Wasn't Just The Head Of A Company.

116
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,630
He Was A Father And A Husband.

117
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,150
(Wilhelmina) He Was Almost...

118
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,580
<I>My</I> Husband.

119
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,660
What Is She Doing Here? Who Is She Wearing?

120
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,150
I Can't Believe She Came.

121
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,110
What The Hell Are You Doing Here,

122
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,480
Looking For Free Publicity? (Scoffs) I Don't Know What You're Talking About,Daniel.

123
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,240
I'm An Emotional Wreck. I Just Came To Add A Few Words.

124
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,140
After All,No One Loved Or Knew Bradford The Way I Did.

125
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,880
Oh. Hello,Claire.

126
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,070
Decided Not To Wear Black,I See.

127
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,500
Motion To Terminate Wilhelmina Slater

128
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,160
As Creative Director, "Mode Magazine,

129
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,930
Effective Immediately.

130
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,380
All Those In Favor?

131
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,460
Aye. Aye.

132
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,910
The Motion Carries.

133
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,670
Rest In Peace,Bitch.

134
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,620
Do They Actually Think I'd Go Without A Fight?

135
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,260
Fools. If I've Saiit Once, I've Said It A Thousand Times.

136
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,390
No One Pushes Wilhelmina Slater Into An Open Grave.

137
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,110
Whoa,Hold On. You Got A Spider In Your Hair. Oh,Aah.

138
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:34,880
I Got It.

139
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,120
Perfect Fit. So Let Me Get This Straight.

140
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,520
Wilhelmina Slater Was Pushed Into A Grave,

141
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,460
And You Didn't Get One Picture?

142
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,570
Mnh-Mnh. Way To Turn A Funeral Into A Tragedy.

143
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,980
Are You Sure This Isn't Weird,

144
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,170
Decorating The Tree Right After A Funeral? No. Not At All.

145
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,870
Don't You Remember That Year We Decorated The Tree

146
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,140
An Hour After Dad Passed His Kidney Stone?

147
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,520
And Here It Is.

148
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,000
Can We Put That In The Back This Year?

149
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,860
I Always Feared That This Day

150
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,870
Could Be A Possibility.

151
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,430
But I Was Prepared.

152
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,230
Marc,Must Do Something Now...

153
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,570
Something Beautiful And Final,

154
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,350
So They Will Never Forget We Were Here.

155
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,650
Is This Gonna Be Some Kind Of Murder-Suicide Thing?

156
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,110
'Cause Cliff And I Have "Chorus Line" Tickets Tonight.

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,470
Willie,That Is <I>So</I> "Mission: Impossible Iii."

158
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,980
Where's The Wallet I Gave You For Your Birthday?

159
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,540
Oh,I Love It. It's So Soft And--

160
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,760
Oh,My "Chorus Line" Tickets! What Are You Doing?

161
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,260
Couldn't Take A Chance This Could Be Traced Back To Me.

162
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,760
What Is That?

163
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,900
Something The Pentagon Cooked Up.

164
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,570
Date One Of The Joint Chiefs,

165
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,220
Amazing The Access You'll Have.

166
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,080
(Betty) See,That's What I'm Talking About--Tradition.

167
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,180
<I>Papi's</I> Kidney Stone? All Of It,Hilda-- The Tree,

168
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,850
My Popsicle Santa,

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,430
Justin's Madonna And Child...

170
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,130
Now Is That Rocco Or Lourdes?

171
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,930
Lourdes. I Made Rocco The Star Of The Manger.

172
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,820
Ready?

173
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,490
Wait. I've Been Putting My Gym Membership

174
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,080
On Your Credit Card For The Last Five Years.

175
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,230
I Just Thought, You Know,If This Was It,

176
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,660
I Wanna Go With A Clear Conscience. We Are Not Dyingmarc.

177
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,750
"Mode" Is.

178
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,930
That Place Is Gonna Fall Apart Without You.

179
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,360
Hilda, They Don't Need Me.

180
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,040
They've Been Putting Out That Magazine Forever.

181
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,180
What Could Possibly Go Wrong?

182
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,110
What? Oh,No.

183
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,730
Whoa.

184
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,210
It Is Done.

《丑女贝蒂》 第二季第9集

187
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,870
Well,Really Nice Tree This Year.

188
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,020
It's The Same Tree Every Year.

189
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,030
But You Know What Would Be Really Nice? Hilda,Don't Even Get Started On That Pink Tree Again.

190
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,610
You Know,You Didn't Even See It.

191
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,020
Everyone At The Queens Center Mall Was Talking About It.

192
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,730
That,And That Hot Puerto Rican Santa.

193
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,220
(Whispers) They Had To Drag Me Off His Lap. Hilda.

194
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,810
A Pink Tree Would Be <I>So</I> Kitsch.

195
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,990
Pink Is The New Green. (Normal Voice) Yeah, Maybe With Some White Lights!

196
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,790
And Tinsel. No. <I>No.</I> No,Guys. This Is Tradition.

197
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,480
Okay. Okay. I Just Thought Maybe One Year,

198
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,270
We Could Do Something Different. Get Off My Balls.

199
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,500
Seriously, You're On My Balls.

200
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,430
Hi,Henry. What's Up?

201
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,750
(Henry) Betty,We've Lost The Entire Magazine.

202
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,760
The Computers Have Crashed, And The Book Has Disappeared.

203
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,300
Oh,My God.

204
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,050
The Tech Guys Said All The Hard Drives Are Dead,

205
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,900
Might As Well Bury 'Em.

206
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,340
Oh,Sorry. Bad Day For That.

207
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,090
They Weren't Able To Retrieve Anything? Yout,Editorial, Graphics... All Gone.

208
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,410
The Issue Ships In 12 Hours.

209
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,650
We Are Never Gonna Make Our Deadline. We Have To.

210
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,910
This Magazine's Ready In Trouble.

211
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,980
If We Can't Get Our Flagship Publication On The Stands...

212
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,160
It Could Be The Final Nail In The Coffin.

213
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,090
Oh,I Don't Know Why I Keep Saying These Things.

214
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,660
Did You Guys Get My Flowers? It's Okay,Henry.

215
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,940
How Could Wilhelmina Stoop So Low?

216
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,790
I Can't Believe She Would Do Something Like This.

217
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,310
You Know What? I'm Not Gonna Let Her Win.

218
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,690
Henry,Start Making Calls. Get Everyone In Here.

219
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,310
Actually, They're Already Here. (Daniel) What?

220
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,420
I Called Everyone I Could Think Of.

221
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,000
I Thought You Might Need Some Help.

222
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,140
You're Back?

223
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,960
For Tonight.

224
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,340
Okay,According To Betty's Diagram,

225
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,200
You Need More Lights In Quadrant Four.

226
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,260
I Know What I'm Doing.

227
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,040
<I>Mija,</I> You Don't. Look What You're Doing.

228
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,880
You're Clumping Instead Of Draping.

229
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,340
And More To The Right. You Know What, Mr. Drapey?

230
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,850
If You Don't Like The Way I'm Doing It,

231
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,690
Feel Free To Do It Yourself.  <I>Ay!</I> Ay-Yi-Yi-Yi! Hilda!

232
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,760
It's Okay. It's Okay. Nothing's Broken.

233
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,960
Look,The Naments Are Still In The Box.

234
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,930
See? Mom's Angel's All Right.

235
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,070
<I>Ay,</I> Chihuahua.

236
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Ooh,Betty's Gonna Kill You.

237
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:52,970
Stop. Me?

238
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,090
I'm Gonna Kill You Both. Whoa!

239
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,880
Okay,I've Contacted The Freelancers,

240
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,420
And They've Sent Us Drafts Of Winter Getaways,

241
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,190
So How About The Cover?

242
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,630
It's Gone.

243
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,540
Well,Who Shot It? Desouza.

244
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,840
We're Trying To Get Ahold Of His Reps,

245
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,920
But They Can't Find Him. Okay,We Need That Cover.

246
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,840
Stay On It,Betty. All Right? (Betty) Okay.

247
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,600
Okay,Style And Beauty, Everyone. Present And Accounted For.

248
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,980
My,My,My, Such Somber Faces.

249
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,850
Did Somebody Die?

250
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,490
I'm Gonna Kick Her Ass.

251
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,650
Girl Fight... Kinda.

252
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,670
Did You Come To Clean Out Your Office,Wilhelmina?

253
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,220
No,Daniel. I Came To Clean Out Yours. (Laughs)

254
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,320
People,I Am Seeking Greener Pastures,

255
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,060
And So Can All Of You. (Snaps) Marc.

256
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,050
"Slater," A Luxury Fashion Magazine

257
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,170
For Trendsetters And Jet-Setters.

258
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,510
Are You Kidding Me?

259
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,360
We're Currently Setting Up Our Offices,

260
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,820
And There Are Still Positions Available.

261
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,840
So Who Would Like To Leave This Crumbling Dynasty?

262
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,310
I Should Add That "Slater" Employees

263
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,150
Will Receive A 15% Raise...

264
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,870
(Betty) No.

265
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,730
And Benefits Include Dental...

266
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,400
What Are You Doing? Oh,I'm Joking,Henry.

267
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,500
Just Wait.

268
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,000
And... Cosmetic Surgery.

269
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,100
Oh,Go! Go,Go,Go.

270
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,300
(Betty) Amanda! Mm.

271
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,330
No,Shame On You.

272
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,540
Now As For The Rest Of You, Your Loyalty Is Admirable.

273
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,920
You Remind Me Of The Orchestra

274
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,080
That Stayed Behind To Play As The "Titanic" Sank.

275
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,100
Get On The Boats,People. Don't Be Stupid.

276
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,550
No. No,Don't Get On The Boats. We Don't Need Boats!

277
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,310
This Magazine Is Not Sinking.

278
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,720
Our Father Built "Mode."

279
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,370
Alexis And I Are Gonna Continue His Legacy.

280
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,370
Lovely Speech,Daniel. But Now That Your Father's Gone,

281
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,810
You Should Know He Pretty Much Felt

282
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,620
That You're An Incompetent Buffoon. That's It! Her Ass Is Getting Kicked!

283
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,040
No,No,No,No,No. Ignore Her.

284
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,790
And,As For You,Alexis,What Your Father Thout Of You...

285
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,560
(Whispers) Circus Freak.

286
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,860
Oh,That's It.

287
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,480
(Normal Voice) I Look Forward To Seeing Your Issue On The Stands.

288
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,830
And Your Fly Is Down.

289
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,880
Made You Look.

290
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,200
(Clears Throat) Come On.

291
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,440
Come On.

292
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,110
I'm Sorry,Marc.

293
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,890
I Have To Stay.

294
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
You Can't Be Serious.

295
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,190
This Wasn't Just Bradford's Magazine.

296
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,400
It Was Also My Mother's.

297
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,790
(Sighs) Oh,Okay.

298
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,170
Your Fly's Down,Too. What?

299
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,700
(Laughs) Oh.

300
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,170
This Is Just So Wrong.

301
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,200
She Can't Do This.

302
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,880
But She Did.

303
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,040
I Don't Know How Long I'm Gonna Be Here,

304
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,130
So I Was Just Calling To Check In,

305
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,400
See How You're Making Out With The Tree.

306
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:38,200
How Does It Look? It's Hot. It's Very Hot. It's Smoking.

307
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,250
What's Going On?

308
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,730
Nothing. Hilda.

309
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,820
Nothing. Okay,See,No.

310
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,180
You're Doing That--That Lying Thing With Your Voice,

311
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,700
Like When You Were Four Months Pregnant,

312
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,610
And You Kept Telling Dad,

313
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,990
"No,I'm Just Bloated And Gassy." Okay,But I Don't Want You Freaking Out.

314
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,310
I Still See Some Smoke. The Christmas Tree Might Have Caught

315
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,040
A Little Bit On Fire. Fire?

316
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,740
Yeah,But It's Okay. Nobody Got Hurt.

317
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,500
We Put It Out With An Extinguisher. No Big Deal.

318
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,820
Well,What About The Ornaments? Are They--Are They Okay?

319
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,210
Popsicle Santa-- He's Made Of Wood.

320
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,420
Yeah,Well,At Least He Went Quickly.

321
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,720
But We Saved The Angel, And That Was Mom's Favorite,

322
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,000
So Really,That Was The Most Important One.

323
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,250
Now Listen,I Don't Want To Point Fingers Here,

324
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,470
But If We Had Gone With The Flame-Resistant Pink One-- Aah!

325
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,690
All Right. No Pink Tree, Jeez. Call You Later.

326
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,770
Okay.

327
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,680
What Are You Doing Here?

328
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,160
Will You Please Just Leave Me Alone?

329
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,750
'Cause I Don't Feel Guilty About Anything. Look In There. My Son Is Having A Crisis.

330
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,340
Isn't This Normally Where You Give

331
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,180
One Of Your Annoying Pep Talks?

332
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,460
Look,I Don't Know How To Fix This. You Don't Have To Fix It.

333
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,420
He Just Needs To Know That You're There.

334
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,860
Now Go,And Maybe Your Cute Little Kitten Screen Saver

335
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,190
Doesn't Get Hurt.

336
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,840
<I>GAtito?</I>  <I>(Kitten Meows)</I>

337
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,370
Okay. Okay,Okay,Okay. I'm Going.

338
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,670
How You Doing?

339
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,650
Wilhelmina's Right. My Father Said I Couldn't Do This.

340
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,110
You Are So Wrong, Daniel.

341
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,290
Your Father Believes In You.

342
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,400
It's Brilliant.

343
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,920
The Day We Bury Him, The Magazine Dies.

344
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,650
Look,Daniel, If You Want To Keep

345
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,930
Your Father's Legacy Alive,

346
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,840
Then You Need To Step Up.

347
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,080
It's Like You Said In Your Eulogy,

348
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,880
You <I>Promised</I> To Fill His Shoes.

349
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,530
That Was Easy To Say.

350
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,410
And Hard To Do. I Know.

351
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,780
My Mom Was All About Tradition--

352
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,390
New Sweaters Whenever We Went Back To School,

353
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,520
Blue Spruce Tree With Colored Lights

354
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,140
Every Christmas,

355
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,560
And For Our Birthdays, She Always Made Tamales.

356
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,730
That Was The Toughest Part,

357
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,150
Because She Died Right Before My Dad's Birthday,

358
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,180
And We Were All Pretty Much A Mess.

359
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,840
And As Hard As It Was, I Stepped Up.

360
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,550
Now I Make Them Every Year.

361
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,680
And I Like To Think That In Some Small Way,

362
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,900
That Keeps Her Alive.

363
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,880
Don't You Think I Want To Do That For Him?

364
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,050
Wilhelmina Took Everyone. There's No One Left.

365
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,190
No One? No.

366
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,810
Daniel,You Have Sheila,A Great Editor,

367
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,090
Veronica, A Very Good Art Director--

368
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,680
Oh,And,Ooh,Henry,

369
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,400
He's A Cute Accountant--

370
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,030
And Seven Very Able Assistants

371
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,090
Who Can Do A Lot More For You

372
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,480
Than Get You Your Coffee.

373
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,030
You're Right.

374
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,330
Let's Go Make Tamales.

375
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,060
Okay,Everyone, We Have Been Wasting Time.

376
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,060
Sorry,<I>I</I> Have Been Wasting Time.

377
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,800
First Of All,My Father Would Be Touched

378
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,990
To See That You All Stayed.

379
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,480
Your Loyalty To "Mode" Means A Lot. Whoo! Yeah,"Mode!"

380
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,090
Yes! Exactly. Yay,"Mode." We Have To Stay Positive.

381
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,320
I Know This Seems Daunting.

382
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,840
I Also Know That We Can Do This. Yes,We Can Do This!

383
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,740
Uh,Betty? We're Actually Okay. Thanks.

384
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,050
Alexis, Where Do We Stand?

385
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,610
We Recovered Most Of Our Advertising,

386
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,020
Which Leaves 83 Pages Of Content To Fill

387
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,140
Before We Can Ship. Okay,All Right. All Right,83.

388
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,280
Amanda,Will You Write That Number On The Board?

389
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,670
Christina,What Do We Have Left Over From The Prada Shoot? Just A Few Bits.

390
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,250
Great,Let's Pull Them All Then. Yeah,Which Is Fine, 'Cause They're At Home.

391
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,020
But Can Get Them. Just Walk Along.

392
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,600
Great. Uh,Betty, What's The Last Book You Read?

393
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,660
Um,"Knuffle Bunny."

394
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,160
What? I Was Babysitting.

395
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,770
Give Me 500 Words On That.

396
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,960
I Don't Think There Are Even 500 Words In The Whole Book. I'm Sure You--

397
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,480
Okay,But I'm On It. I'm On It. Okay.

398
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,370
Oh,What About Henry? He's Very Artistic.

399
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,740
He Is The Only Person I Know Who Can Keep An Orchid Alive.

400
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,250
And,And--Oh,He's Really Good At Chinese Cooking.

401
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,680
Wait,You Liked My Cashew Chicken?

402
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,620
Why Didn't You Eat It? 'Cause I Don't Like Asparagus.

403
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,450
Well,I Didn't Have To Make It With Asparagus. I Know,But I--

404
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,600
Guys! Henry,Just Type It Up.  <I>U</I> Are Our New Food Editor.

405
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,340
Perfect. We're Editors.

406
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,510
Okay,I Think We're Going To Need This.

407
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,590
What Now? Just Got Off The Phone With The Printer.

408
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,770
He Said The Latest He Could Push

409
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,740
The Run Of The Issue Is 2:00 A.M. Did You Explain The Situation?

410
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,810
He Didn't Care, But He Did Say

411
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,120
I Sounded Like I Had Great Boobs.

412
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,260
(Sighs) I Know This Guy-- Arthur Kaplan. Total Dog.

413
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,350
I Think I Can Get Him To Extend Our Deadline.

414
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,240
Let Me Go Change Into Something A Little More Persuasive.

415
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,580
Are You Sure You Want To Do That? We've Got To Get This Issue Out.

416
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,350
If I Can Get These Things To Save The Magazine,

417
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,250
Maybe I Can Finally Write Them Off. Um,That's Actually Not A Legitimate Business Expense.

418
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,150
Okay,I've Got A Rough Sketch Of The Front-Of-Book Graphics.

419
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,720
Good. Just Put It Up On The Board.

420
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,530
All Right. Six Pages. Amanda,Take Us Down,Please.

421
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,180
77,Einstein.

422
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,610
* Step It Up *

423
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,700
* Step It Up *

424
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,910
* Step It Up *

425
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,510
* Step It Up *

426
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,750
* Step It Up *

427
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,190
* Step It Up *

428
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,440
Listen,Daniel,Um,It's Not That I Don't Love My Job

429
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,760
Of Writing And Erasing Numbers From That Board,

430
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,700
But I Just Wish There Was A Way

431
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,810
I Could Contribute More Tonight.

432
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:57,200
Okay,Um,What Do You Want To Do? Well,Um,Fey Sommers Was My Mother.

433
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:57,750
Really?

434
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,480
'Cause You Haven't Mentioned That In Three Minutes.

435
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,320
(Nick) Hey!

436
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,930
I Just--I Think Maybe I Inherited

437
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,470
Some Of Her Creative Instincts.

438
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,610
Um,You're In Charge Of Thewhat's Hot?" Section. (Groans)

439
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,000
Wait,Really? Oh,My God, People Actually Read Tha Mm-Hmm.

440
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,150
This Is Huge. I Just Got Promoted.

441
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,030
Who Wants To Go Out And Celebrate? (Laughs)

442
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,080
I'm Just Kidding. Hey,Sheila,Walk With Me.

443
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,730
Did That Sound Professional? (Scoffs)

444
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,010
I've Got An Update On The Cover. (Daniel) Oh,Good.

445
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,090
Not Good. The Photographer's On A 16-Hour Flight To Australia,

446
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,930
And We Can't Get The Negatives. Oh,We're Screwed.

447
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,370
No. No,We're Not Screwed. We're In The Homestretch.

448
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,010
We Have A Studio Here. Why Don't We Just Shoot Another Cover?

449
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,970
Because We Sold The Advertisers On A Cameron Ashlock Cover.

450
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,470
The Cover Sells The Entire Magazine.

451
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,670
I Mean,She's Huge-- She's Got A Movie,An Album,

452
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,840
A Perfume Coming Out... Daniel,Why Don't We Just Find Her

453
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,530
And Shoot The Cover Again? That Could Be A Problem.

454
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,070
You Didn't Hear About Her Meltdown?

455
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,850
Apparently America's Sweetheart Was A Little Bit

456
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,310
Under The Influence When She Did "Larry King."

457
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,060
Is She In Jail Or Rehab? Rehab. Safe Haven Hospital On 56th Street.

458
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,150
Okay, Why Don't We Try

459
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,260
And Get Her Released For A Couple Of Hours? No,Daniel. That's Not How Rehab Works.

460
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,180
Okay. All Right. Uh,Plan "B."

461
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,730
I Want You Guys To Keep Working On These Pages.

462
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,630
I'm Gonna Take Care Of This Cover.

463
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,840
Daniel,What Do You Have In Mind?

464
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,710
We're Gonna Break Her Out Of Rehab.

465
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,730
No.

466
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,310
Okay,You See Why I Don't Want To Come Back To "Mode"?

467
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,420
We Are Breaking An Actress Out Of Rehab,

468
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,570
And We Just Paid A Bodyguard $1,000 To Get In Here.

469
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,530
Actually... (Clears Throat) It Was $2,000.

470
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,300
Oh,Well...

471
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,150
This Is It. Go Ahead.

472
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,920
Hi.

473
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,260
Sorry To Bother You, Cameron,Uh--

474
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,050
Wait A Minute.

475
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,430
You're Not The Cute Bipolar Boy I Was Gonna Make Out With.

476
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,190
We Just Need To Talk To You.

477
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,770
Who Are You?

478
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,490
And How Did You Even Know I Was Here?

479
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,200
Oh,Everyone Knows You're Here. It's All Over The News.

480
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,210
I Have Got  <I>Such</I> A Good Publicist.

481
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,080
I Mean,So Worth The Money. (Laughs)

482
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,850
(Singsongy Voice) Oh,Arthur.

483
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,390
Hello.

484
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,160
Alexis Meade Is Here.

485
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,130
I Know You're Working Late,

486
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,190
So I Thought I'd Bring You

487
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,120
A Little Midnight Snack.

488
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,940
Whoa. Damn.

489
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,400
You Are One Big Girl. Mm.

490
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,980
You're Not Arthur. Arthur Called It Quits Last Spring.

491
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,320
I'm Harvey Milfree.

492
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,000
Look At The Size Of Those Feet.

493
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,340
How Do You Find Shoes?

494
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,730
I'm Alexis Meade, For "Mode" Magazine. Oh,Yeah. Your People Called.

495
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,160
We're Not Pushing Your Deadline. Oh,Come On.

496
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,050
We Just Need A Couple Of Hours. We're Shorthanded.

497
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,810
"Shorthanded." Nice.

498
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,840
Real Nice. Make Fun Of A Little Person.

499
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,050
No,I'm Not.

500
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,530
And Why Is It Okay For You To Make Fun Of Me For Being Tall?

501
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,590
Tall? You're A Monster.

502
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,270
In Fact, You're Scaring Me.

503
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,060
Now I'm Gonna Have To Sleep With The Lights On.

504
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,290
Good Night.

505
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,630
You Are So Rude. Our Magazine Is In Trouble.

506
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,310
I Came All The Way Over Here To Reason With You. No,You Didn't.

507
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,910
You Came All The Way Over Here To Get Arthur

508
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,320
To Keep This Place Open By Showing Your Jugs.

509
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,320
But As Soon As You Saw It Was Me,

510
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,440
You Covered 'Em Up.

511
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,960
That's Not True. I Was Just Startled.

512
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,630
Then Show 'Em To Me. No. I'm Not Showing You Anything.

513
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,190
Come On. Just A Little Peek,Eh?

514
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,770
I Have A Better Idea.

515
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,510
You,Me And The Girls Stay Inside.

516
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,170
"Mode" Magazine.

517
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,010
Yeah,I Think I Did The Cover...

518
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,500
And Probably The Photographer.

519
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,860
I Usually Do. (Laughs)

520
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,730
We Actually Met On The Shoot.

521
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,650
Uh,I-I Got You Coffee. Uh,You Threw It At Me,

522
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,070
And Then You Filled The Cup With Vodka.

523
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,860
(Laughs) Classic Me. Hee.

524
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:05,250
But That Was The Old Cameron. I'm Clean And Sober Now,

525
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:09,010
And Since I've Been Here, I've Totally Found God.

526
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,410
Well,That's--That's Great. And He Really <I>Touches</I> Me.

527
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,780
You Know,I Mean,But,Like... Not In A Sexual Way?

528
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,710
Okay,So,Um,Listen.

529
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:20,930
Cameron, We're Kind Of In A Bind.

530
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,170
I Know This Is, Um,Unorthodox... (Exhales)

531
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,690
But There Was A Very Big Screwup

532
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,690
At The Magazine. Oh!

533
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,120
I Was Just Wondering If There's Any Chance

534
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,840
We Could Convince You To Reshoot The Cover.

535
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,890
Like,Tonight?

536
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,080
Are You Crazy?

537
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,700
I'm In A Really Intensive 6-Week Recovery Program Here.

538
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,170
So There's Just No Way.

539
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,430
Cameron,

540
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,400
Let's--Let's Talk About This.

541
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,120
Isn't A Really Big Part Of This Making Amends?

542
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,670
I Mean, You Do Owe Us.

543
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,720
You Were Kind Of Mn The First Time.

544
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,310
This Could Be Your Chance To-- To Make Up For It...

545
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,060
To Get Closer To God.

546
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,950
Yes. Yes.

547
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,710
Yeah,And I-I Guess I Did Kinda Pee In Someone's Chair

548
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,570
Because I Thought It Was A Bathroom.

549
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,080
Oh,That Was My Chair.

550
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,350
Classic You.

551
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,740
Yes,Totally.

552
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,340
(Wilhelmina) Attention,Everyone,Attention.

553
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,890
I'd Like To Congratulate You

554
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,720
On Making The Best Decision Of Your Lives.

555
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,640
I'm So Happy To Have You All Here With Me.

556
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,120
Uh,Except For You, Florence.

557
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,680
I Thought It Was Obvious The Way I Felt About You.

558
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,630
As Of Tomorrow Morning, Financing For My,Um--

559
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,450
Ahem.

560
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,020
Ah,<I>Our</I> Magazine...

561
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,310
Will Be Secure,

562
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,540
And The Age Of "Slater" Will Officially Commence.

563
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,750
(Laughs) To World Dination.

564
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,210
Uh,To "Slater."

565
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,020
(All) To "Slater."

566
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,520
Now Enjoy The Complimentary Cheese--

567
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,150
Two Pieces Each.

568
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,100
Wilhemommy, One Question--

569
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,650
You Know I Usually Jump Right On Board Your Schemes,

570
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,530
Strap Myself In And Enjoy The Ride,

571
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,370
But Where <I>Are</I> We Getting The Money

572
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,000
To Launch This Magazine...

573
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,760
Without Meade Publications Behind Us?

574
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:18,420
Well,Since My Sugar Daddy Kicked It Early,

575
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,390
I'm Going To Turn To My Own Daddy. (Chuckles)

576
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,930
What's That Smirk For? Just That You Have A Father.

577
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,090
I Always Imagined You Rising Out Of A Cauldron

578
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,480
Or Born Of A Jackal.

579
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,910
(Laughs) You're So Sweet.

580
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,700
You Get An Extra Piece Of Cheese. Oh!

581
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,280
Oh,My God,Daniel, That's Great.

582
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,740
I Knew You Could Do It.

583
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,540
Hey,And Wilhelmina Was Wrong.

584
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,790
Dad Would Be So Proud Of You. Well,He'd Be Proud Of You,Too.

585
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,420
You Know That,Right? Yeah,Yeah. Of Course.

586
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,930
How's It Goin' At The Printer?

587
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,990
You Get Them To Move The Deadline Yet?

588
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,890
We're Still, Uh,Negotiating.

589
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:55,300
Excuse Me, This Is Not Negotiating.

590
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,850
(Grunts) It's Kidnapping.

591
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,360
Milfree,You Have To Do This For Us.

592
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,340
He Practically Has The Issue Finished.

593
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,340
You Have No Idea What We've Been Through.

594
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,530
Oh,Poor,Pretty Rich Girl's Got Problems.

595
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,300
Boohoo!

596
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,400
As A Matter Of Fact, I Do.

597
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,400
So What Do You Think? Much Better Than I Expected.

598
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,210
Excuse Me.

599
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,750
Wee Bit Of A Problem With Our Cover Girl.

600
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,410
Cameron Said She's Not Gonna Come Out Of The Dressing Room

601
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,190
Until She Gets Some Booze Or Drugs. What?

602
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,200
What About God? Oh,Yeah. She Mentioned Him. She Said...

603
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,950
(Imitates Cameron) "God, I Need Some Booze Or Drugs."

604
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,210
I Knew It Was A Bad Idea To Get Her Out.

605
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,880
Look,Maybe We Should Call Her Mother Or Her Makeup Artist.

606
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,090
Who Do You Think She's Closer To? Makeup Artist.

607
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,930
That Whole Thing With Her Mother... Nuh. Daniel. Daniel, What Are You Doing?

608
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,570
I'm Gonna Fix This. How?

609
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,340
I'm Gonna Give Her A Ink.

610
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,920
It's The Cover,Betty. It's What My Father Would Do.  <I>It's True.</I>

611
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,040
You're The One Who Said

612
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,340
To Follow In His Footsteps. But I--

613
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,560
Tell The Photographer She'll Be Out In Ten Minutes.

614
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,010
Where Are Your Pages?

615
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,520
(Mumbles) I Don't Know. So You Have Nothing.

616
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,220
They Can't Close The Front Half Of The Book

617
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,520
Unless We Have The "What's Hot?" Section.

618
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,490
(Normal Voice) I'll Get To It.

619
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,230
Are You Kidding Me?

620
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,610
I'm Waiting For Inspiration To Strike.

621
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,820
That's What My Mother, Fey Sommers,Always Did.

622
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:20,600
Her Motto Was,

623
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,650
"Inspiration, Not Perspiration."

624
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,080
I Hate My Life.

625
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,480
I'm Gonna Go To My Office And Self-Medicate.

626
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,010
I'll Be Back In An Hour... Or Thursday.

627
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,730
Hey,I'll Come Through.

628
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,930
My Mom...

629
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,250
Wait,Not Perspiration,

630
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,900
Inspiration.

631
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,680
Someone Here Order 12 Pizzas?

632
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,750
Oh,You Are <I>Just</I> What I've Been Waiting For.

633
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,240
Finally.

634
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,680
A Hot Chick With A Delivery Boy Fantasy.

635
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,820
Oh,No,No,No.

636
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,240
I Need A Favor That's Not Sexual.

637
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,610
Take Off Your Pants.

638
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,420
So You Just Went And...

639
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,220
Well,They Billed Me For A 14-Hour Surgery,

640
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,650
So I Certainly Hope They Did More Than That.

641
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,930
And Your Family Was Like, "Hey,It's A Girl."

642
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,440
Not Exactly.

643
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,400
My Mother Was Pretty Good,

644
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,510
And,Actually, My Brother Was Okay,

645
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,440
But My Father...

646
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,550
To Be Honest, I Don't Know.

647
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,080
I-I Thought He Got There, But Now...

648
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,310
What?

649
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,630
Someone Said Something To Me Today

650
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,560
That Made Me Question Everything.

651
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,210
You Know, When I Was 10,

652
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,870
My Father Sold Me To The Circus.

653
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,320
Oh,My God. Harvey,That's Horrible.

654
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,110
Wait A Minute...

655
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,230
Okay,Not Exactly,

656
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,340
But You Wouldn't Believe How Much

657
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,440
Big Harvey's Scored With That Line.

658
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,220
You Are One Twisted Mister.

659
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,230
Hey,It Takes One To Know One,Huh?

660
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,850
But I Know Where You're Coming From.

661
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,650
Believe It Or Not, I Wasn't The Kid

662
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,740
My Father Imagined Having, Either.

663
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,780
I Wasted So Much Time Trying To Win Him Over.

664
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,170
And Then Finally, I Just Said,

665
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,150
"To Hell With It. This Is Who I Am."

666
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,330
Yeah,Well, My Father's Dead.

667
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,410
There's No One To Say "To Hell With It" To.

668
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,480
Exactly,  You're Free.

669
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,280
Now It Only Matters What <I>You</I> Think.

670
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,720
If You Wanna Go,

671
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,430
You Can Go.

672
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,730
Looks Like We're Not Gonna Be Making Our Deadline.

673
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,620
You Know What? What's Another Hour?

674
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,090
I Might Be Able To Move Around My Other Magazines.

675
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,810
Sit Down.

676
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,210
Pass Me A Grape. You Got It.

677
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,110
And Now, As A Little Thank-You,

678
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,570
You Might Wanna Show Me Your--

679
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,390
No,Harvey, I Do Not.

680
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,810
Hey.

681
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,750
I Finished My Recipe. I Left Out The Cumin.

682
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,490
Something Martha Taught Me-- Never Give It All Away.

683
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,160
Now Where's Daniel? I Have To Have Him Sign Off On This.

684
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,040
He's In Cameron's Dressing Room... Enabling.

685
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,780
He's Sleeping With Her? Man,He's Good.

686
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,440
Uh,Uh,I Mean In Aad,Bad Way.

687
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,010
No,He's Giving Her A Drink.

688
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,410
This Shoot Sucks!

689
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,790
Don't Touch Me,Pigs! Maybe That Drink Wasn't Such A Good Idea.

690
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,260
I'm America's Frean' Sweetheart!

691
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,640
Don't Hurt Her. Aah!

692
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,020
And How Come No One's Taking My Picture?

693
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,090
Amanda Is Never Going To Come Through,

694
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,260
So I Say We Just Kill This "What's Hot?" Section,

695
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,950
And We Pad "The Quick And Easy Styling Tips."

696
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,020
But That's Just It.

697
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,730
They're Quick And Easy.

698
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,230
There's Not Much To Say.

699
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:10,310
Not So Fast. Inspiration Has Struck. Whew.

700
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,410
Ladies And Gentlemen, I Present To You

701
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,460
January's Issue Of...

702
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,030
* "What Hot?" *

703
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,390
Ow! (Beatboxes) Click.

704
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,100
It's... (Makes Sizzling Sound) Hot...

705
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,620
(Imitates Echo) Hot,Hot,Hot,

706
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,380
Hot,Hot.

707
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,680
I Know.

708
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,220
Amanda, I Knew Fey Sommers.

709
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,040
I Worked With Fey Sommers.

710
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,350
I Once Made Out With Fey Sommers.

711
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,160
Amanda...

712
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,070
<I>You</I> Are No Fey Sommers.

713
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,460
Kid,I Think It's Time You Went Back To The Phones.

714
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,370
"Easy Tips" It Is.

715
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,490
All Right.

716
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,950
I Know That You're Down,

717
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,680
And That It's Probably Not The Best Time For Me To Lecture,

718
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,400
But In What World Did Giving An Alcoholic

719
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,850
A Bottle Of Vodka Seem Like The Right Thing To Do?

720
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,370
My Father's World,

721
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,120
But Not Mine.

722
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,860
I Went To Give Her The Drink,

723
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,630
But I Couldn't Do It.

724
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,270
She Didn't Take It Very Well,Obviously.

725
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,730
Wait,You Mean,You Did-- You Didn't--You Didn't-- No.

726
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,250
Daniel,That's Great. Is It?

727
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,370
I Lost Our Cover.

728
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,850
Without Our Cover, There's No Issue.

729
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,680
I Mean, Let's Face It,Betty.

730
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,110
I Am No Bradford Meade.

731
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,030
Ugh,No,You're Not.

732
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,410
But Maybe That's A Good Thing.

733
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,720
I Mean,You've Got A Whole Blank Slate.

734
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,030
You Can Stop Thinking About What Bradford Meade Would Do.

735
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,370
What Would Daniel Meade Do?

736
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,900
What? What? You're Staring At Me.

737
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,020
No,I'm Just Thinking About Something You Said.

738
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,480
Really?

739
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,550
What Did I Say?

740
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,400
Because Seriously, I'm... (Yawns)

741
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,790
So Tired Right Now,

742
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,930
I Don't Know What Came Out Of My Mouth.

743
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,770
Make Sure Nobody Leaves.

744
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,670
I Think I May Have Found Our Cover.

745
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,080
Wait.

746
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,670
Come On.

747
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,790
Tell Me What I Said.

748
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,570
So,Ladies And Gentlemen, I Present To You

749
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,740
The January Cover.

750
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,720
Oh,It's A-- It's A Foldout,Too.

751
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,380
Thank You.

752
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,160
Thank You.

753
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,350
(Sheila) Nice Work,Daniel.

754
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,590
We Sold The Advertisers On A Big,Bold Cover.

755
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,710
I Think This Is It.

756
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:06,240
Issue Number 4-1-2 Is Ready To Ship!

757
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,280
Oh,No,Uh,0-0-1.

758
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,320
I Think After 40 Years,

759
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,240
It's About Time For A New Legacy.

760
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,940
Whatever. Let's Just Get This Bitch Out! Oh!

761
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,250
Good Job. You Did It. Thank You.

762
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,320
Okay,You Made Me Cry.

763
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,310
Well,It Was Your Whole Blank Slate Thing

764
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,040
That Gave Me The Idea.

765
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,650
Thank You Very Much.

766
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,300
You Know,Betty, You're Really Good At This.

767
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,890
You Sure You Don't Want To Come Back?

768
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,650
I Can't.

769
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,680
My Mother Would Never Approve

770
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,170
Of The Person I Was Becoming Here.

771
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,170
I Was Changing.

772
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,970
Hey,Hey.

773
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,540
You're Growing Up.

774
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,520
It Doesn't Matter What You Do For A Living.

775
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,600
You're Always Gonna Have Tough Choices To Make,Betty.

776
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,140
I Really Think You Can Stay Here

777
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,200
And Still Be The Person You Want To Be--

778
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,860
Someone Your Mother Would Be <I>So</I> Proud Of.

779
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,880
You're Not Gonna Start Crying Again,Are You?

780
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,460
(Voice Breaks) No.

781
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,510
Yes.

782
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,960
Thanks For Coming So Quickly,Daddy.

783
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,180
I Really Needed You.

784
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:25,250
You Haven't Said That To Me Since You Were A Little Girl.

785
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,060
I'm Sorry About Bradford.

786
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,660
I'm Devastated.

787
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,600
Consequently, I'm Moving On With My Life,

788
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,230
And Starting A New Magazine.

789
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,110
So... Why Am I Here?

790
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,080
I Need Seed Money--

791
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,080
Just A 6-Month Swingoan.

792
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,320
I'll Pay You Back In Full, Give You Gross Participation...

793
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,880
That's Real Money From The First Issue On.

794
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,060
Where Is She?

795
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,690
Marc? She's Right There Making Omelets.

796
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,760
Scallions,Senator?

797
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,710
I'm Talking About You.

798
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,270
Whatever Happened To Wanda?

799
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,560
Oh,She's Still Here,

800
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,080
Just... Prettier.

801
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,460
I'm Not So Sure.

802
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,620
Uh,What Are You Talking About?

803
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,420
You Always Pushed Me To Be Successful,

804
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,330
And I Want To Start A Magazine,

805
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,920
So What's The Problem?

806
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,990
You Buried Your Fianc? 12 Hours Ago.

807
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,450
You Tell Me.

808
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,390
This Is Rich--

809
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:21,860
You Giving Me A Lecture On Compassion.

810
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:22,900
You Know What? Let's Just Forget

811
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,630
That This Is A Daughter Talking To Her Father,

812
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,800
'Cause We Both Forgot That Years Ago.

813
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:30,540
Bottom Line Is You Can Make A Fortune Off This Magazine.

814
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,120
I'm Sorry.

815
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,620
I Am Just Not Interested

816
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,650
In Investing In A World

817
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,380
That Turned You Into...

818
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,250
This.

819
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,230
Daddy,You-- You Can't Walk Out.

820
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,060
Daddy.

821
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,460
What Are You Doing In Here?

822
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,750
Because Everybody Else Has Gone Home.

823
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,190
(Sniffles) Just Leave Me Alone.

824
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:10,280
I'm Drowning My Sorrows In Gorgeous Italian Leather.

825
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,500
Or Maybe They're Hideous.

826
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,410
I Don't Know.

827
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,530
I Thought I Got The Fashion Gene

828
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,160
From My Mom,

829
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,630
But I Was Totally Wrong.

830
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,200
She Was All Instinct With This Stuff.

831
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:26,160
It Just Came So Effortlessly.

832
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,180
Amanda...

833
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,790
I Worked With Your Mother.

834
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,570
<I>Nothing</I> Came Effortlessly.

835
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,280
But What About Her Motto?

836
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,110
"Inspiration, Not Perspiration."

837
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,030
Oh,Bullocks. That Woman Worked Her Arse Off.

838
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,890
Oh,And Sweat Ke A Fishmonger.

839
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,080
Mm,I Should Know.

840
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,800
It Was Me That Had To Clean Off The Stains.

841
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,920
What Am I Gonna Do Now? Work Hard?

842
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,890
Well,Goodness Knows We Can't Have That,Can We?

843
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,280
Listen...

844
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,310
Just Because You Don't Have Fey Sommers' Talent,

845
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,120
Does Not Mean That You're Not Still Her Daughter.

846
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,900
I Mean,Look At Me. My Mother Was All Thumbs.

847
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,350
Fortunately,My Father Liked To Design Gowns...

848
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,060
And Wear Them.

849
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,520
But That Doesn't Help Me.

850
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,790
I Don't Know What My Father's Talents Are.

851
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,220
I Don't Even Know Who He Is.

852
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,390
Well,That's All The More Reason

853
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,520
To Keep Looking. Hmm?

854
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,360
<I>I Like It.</I>

855
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,730
<I>It's Different.</I>

856
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,860
<I>More Importantly,</I>  <I>I'd Never Have Thought Of It.</I>

857
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,680
Well, You're No Daniel Meade.

858
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,100
<I>So,Betty,Now That</I>  <I>You're Guilt-Free,</I>

859
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,980
<I>You Don't Need Me</I>  <I>Anymore.</I>

860
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,730
<I>Where Are You Gonna</I>  <I>Send Me?</I>

861
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,480
Well,You Look Dressed For The Beach,

862
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,720
Warm Sands.

863
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,430
You've Worked Really Hard For A Long Time,Mr. Meade.

864
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,380
You Deserve A Rest.

865
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,390
<I>The Beach It Is.</I>

866
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,070
Am I Ever Gonna See You Again?

867
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:21,030
<I>I Guess</I>  <I>That's Up To You.</I>

868
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,150
Betty,What Is That?

869
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,920
(Gasps) My Pink Tree.

870
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,870
Yeah. I Heard Somewhere That Pink Was The New Green.

871
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,080
And Check It Out--

872
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,040
White Lights For Hilda,

873
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,040
And Tinsel For You.

874
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,050
Hmm. It's Silver, Not Gold,

875
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,490
But You Tried.

876
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,560
(Whispers) Ow.

877
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,690
<I>Mija,</I> What Are You Doing?

878
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,350
We Can't Afford Two Trees.

879
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,920
It's Okay. It's My Treat.

880
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,050
I Took My Job Back.

881
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,300
Oh.

882
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,940
What About The Whole Tradition Thing?

883
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:07,250
Well,Mom Made A Great Tree,

884
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,850
But It's Okay To Shake It Up.

885
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,880
We Can Do It Our Way.

886
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,730
But We'll Always Have This To Honor Her.

887
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,550
(Man) <I>* Feliz Navidad,</I>  <I>Prospero Ano... *</I>

888

00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,300
I Got It. I Got It.

893
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,850
All Right,Then.

894
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,960

* I Wanna Wish You A Merry Christmas *

901
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,220
Man,That Is One Ugly Tree.

902
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,020
Well,Maybe Next Year We Can Try Something Different.

903
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:47,800
Mm.

904
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,460
