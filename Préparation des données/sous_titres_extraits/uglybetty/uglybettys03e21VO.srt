1
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,900
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH YOUR FEELINGS?

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,100
WELL, I DID CONSIDER THROWING A DART AT THE REAL THING,

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,000
BUT SHE'S SO DAMN FAST IN THOSE HEELS!

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,900
CHRISTINA, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,600
BUT YOU'VE MISSED A LOT OF WORK,

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,500
AND IT'S NOT THAT I MIND COVERING FOR YOU,

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,300
BECAUSE I DON'T, BUT I HEMMED A SKIRT YESTERDAY

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,300
WITH A STAPLE GUN.

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,000
I'M SORRY, BETTY. IT'S JUST...

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,600
IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD SINCE SHE'S BANNED ME FROM SEEING THE BABY.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,900
WE'VE BECOME REALLY ATTACHED TO THAT WEE BUGGER.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,200
IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME AND SOME INTENSIVE SCOTTISH THERAPY.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,100
YOU'RE UP, STUART.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,300
LOOK, MAYBE COMING BACK TO WORK  WOULD HELP GET YOUR MIND OFF THINGS.

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,600
MATT'S DAD'S COMING IN TO SIGN THE DEAL THAT'S GONNA HELP SAVE MEADE,

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,000
AND WE'RE THROWING A PARTY!

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,800
AND I ORDERED A COCONUT CAKE JUST FOR YOU.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,200
NO ONE ELSE EVEN LIKES COCONUT.

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
OH, WELL, YOU DO MAKE A GOOD ARGUMENT.

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,200
I JUST WANT TO SEE YOU BE HAPPY AGAIN.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,200
I HATE SEEING YOU LIKE THIS.

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,800
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,600
LISTEN, YOU COMING FOR A DRINK WITH ME IS MORE THAN ENOUGH.

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,100
YOU'RE ONE OF THE GOOD ONES.

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,500
STOP.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
TO FRIENDS.

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,600
TO BEST FRIENDS.

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
OOH, ANOTHER ONE,I THINK.

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,500
TWO MORE, PLEASE?

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,800
(Betty) EVERYBODY, I'M HOME!

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,300
OH, GOOD, YOU'RE HERE!

32
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,300
WHY DO YOU SMELL LIKE JUNIOR HIGH?

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
(Ignacio) HI,HOW'S CHRISTINA?

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,300
GOOD. BETTER. I HOPE HE COMES TO WORK TOMORROW.

35
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,200
OH, GOOD.

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,000
AHEM! OKAY, NOW THAT EVERYBODY IS HERE--

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,900
JUSTIN!

38
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,700
WHAT?

39
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,800
WE HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

40
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,600

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,600
SETTLE, SETTLE. WE ARE NOT GETTING MARRIED.

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,400
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE PREGNANT!

44
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,500
OH, SHE'S PREGNANT!

45
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,400
HILDA,ARE YOU PREGNANT?

46
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,200
OH, MY GOD.

47
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,500

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,300

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,100
LISTEN,TOMORROW...

50
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,400
ARCHIE IS GOING TO ANNOUNCE THE LAUNCH OF HIS CAMPAIGN...

51
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,000
FOR PRESIDENT!

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,500
BOROUGH PRESIDENT.

53
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,400
IT'S STILL PRESIDENT.

54
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,100
THAT'S SO GREAT!

55
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,700
HOW EXCITING, ARCHIE.

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,500
CONGRATULATIONS,MR. PRESIDENT.

57
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,000
HEY, HEY, HUH?
LOOK, HE HAD T-SHIRTS MADE.

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,900
OH, LET ME SEE.

59
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,300
I DON'T HAVE TO WEAR THAT, DO I?

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,600
HEY. "VOTE ARCHIE RODRIGUEZ--

61
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,400
AN A-ROD YOU CAN BELIEVE IN." GOOD ONE.

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,500
VERY CLEVER.

63
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,600
I DON'T GET IT.

64
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,100
NOW I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

65
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,400
AS PART OF THE LAUNCH,NEWS 12 IS DOING A FEATURE ON ME TOMORROW.

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
I WANT YOU TO BE IN IT.

67
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,300
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

68
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,200
YEAH,YOU'VE INSPIRED ME.

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,500
I FIGURED IF I COULD GET SOMEONE LIKE YOU,

70
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL--

71
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

72
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,100
OOH! YEAH, I DON'T PPKNOW WHAT TO SAY!

73
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,000
(giggles) I'M GONNA BE FIRST LADY.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,100
YEAH, OKAY, SORT OF.

75
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,400
I HAVE TO WIN FIRST.

76
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,800
OKAY, WELL, BIGGER PICTURE--

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,900
YOU'RE GONNA BE ON TV TOMORROW,

78
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,500
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO LOOK TASTEFUL.

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,600
AND LET'S JUST SAY YOUR CLOSET PRESENTS SOME... CHALLENGES.

80
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,400
HEY, I COULD GET YOU SOME OUTFITS FROM "MODE."

81
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,200
I'LL HAVE THEM MESSENGERED FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

82
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,100
YOU'RE GONNA PPGIVE ME CLOTHES?

83
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,200
NO, I'M LENDING YOU CLOTHES.

84
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,200
WE'LL SEE. (chuckles)

85
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,300
CHRISTINA?

86
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,900
HAVE YOU SEEN CHRISTINA?

87
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,900
NO.

88
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,900
(groans) WHY ARE YOU STILL NOT HERE?

89
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,600
WHY DID I GET COCONUT CAKE?

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,800
HEY, HILDA,DID YOU GET THE DRESSES?

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,700
YES, THANK YOU, I DID.

92
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,600
BUT I GOT A QUESTION.

93
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,200
HOW BOOBY CAN A FIRST LADY BE?

94
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,400
OR SHOULD I PLAY UP MY ARMS LIKE MICHELLE OBAMA?

95
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,800
WELL, WHY CAN'T YOU XXDO BOTH?

96
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,500
GOD. I DON'T KNOW WHY I AM SO NERVOUS ABOUT ALL OF THIS!

97
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,000
WELL, BECAUSE ARCHIE ASKED YOU TO BE ON TV WITH HIM.

98
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,300
THAT'S SORT OF A BIG DEAL.

99
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,700
I KNOW, I KNOW.

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,700
PPIT'S LIKE HE ASKED ME TO BE PART OF HIS FUTURE OR SOMETHING.

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,600
HOLD ON. CLOSET.

102
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,900
UH, NO,CHRISTINA IS NOT HERE...

103
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,200
RIGHT--RIGHT NOW.

104
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,100
Can I, uh, tell her you called?

105
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,000
OKAY, BYE.

106
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,200
She's still not in yet?

107
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,400
Yeah, I don't know how much longer 

108
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,700
I CAN KEEP COVERING FOR HER.

109
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,000
I MEAN, AT SOME POINT, I HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE, RIGHT?

110
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,200
LISTEN, THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO, YOU KNOW?

111
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,000
At some point, she's gotta make her own decisions.

112
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,300
YOU'RE RIGHT.

113
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,900
SO THE CAMERA ADDS 10 YEARS, RIGHT?

114
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,700
10 pounds.

115
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,400
OH, CRAP, I GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

116
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,700
(sighs) OH, CAN YOU PUT THAT UP HIGHER?

117
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,600
OKAY, EVERYONE, HARTLEY'S COMING AT 11:00 A.M. SHARP,

118
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,200
SO PLEASE,LET'S PICK UP THE PACE.

119
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,600
GOOD MORNING!

120
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,900
HEY, BETTY,WHAT DO YOU THINK?

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,100
LOOKS GREAT.

122
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,500
YEAH, DID YOU CHECK OUT THE OMELET BAR?

123
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,400
IT'S A NICE TOUCH, HUH?

124
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,800
EVERYONE LOVES AN OMELET BAR.

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,100
OH, DID YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO PRINT UP

126
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,400
THE FOURTH-QUARTER PROJECTIONS?

127
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,100
YES.

128
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,700
I REALLY WANTED YOU TO PUT THEM IN THE FANCY PLASTIC--

129
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,600
PLASTIC COVERS?

130
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,400
RELAX, DANIEL.

131
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,600
YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT.

132
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,400
YOU'VE GOT A WONDERFUL PRESENTATION,

133
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,700
AMAZING VISUALS AND AN OMELET BAR.

134
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,300
BETTY, COME ON.
THE MAN MADE ME DRESS UP IN A BUNNY COSTUME.

135
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,300
I HAVE TO PROVE TO HIM THAT I DESERVE RESPECT.

136
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,500
BESIDES, NOTHING'S OFFICIAL UNTIL HE SIGNS ON THE DOTTED LINE.

137
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,000
LOWER THAT, WILL YA?

138
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,300
OH, WILLIAM.

139
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,500
HI, WILLIAM.

140
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,100
HI.

141
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,800
OH, THANK YOU, BETTY.

142
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,200
THAT'LL BE WORTH AT LEAST TEN YEARS OF THERAPY.

143
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,700
UH, DANIEL, WILL YOU HOLD HIM?

144
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,100
HE IS YOUR HALF BROTHER.

145
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,500
OH, UH, O-OKAY.

146
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,000
(sighs) BEFORE WE START OUR PRESENTATION,

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,200
I WANT HARTLEY TO HOLD HIM.

148
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,000
WHY?

149
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,100
WELL, I HEARD HE HAS A SOFT SPOT FOR KIDS.

150
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,900
APPARENTLY, ALL HIS CHARITIES BENEFIT "THE CHILDREN."

151
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,400
SO ONCE HE GETS A GLANCE AT MY LITTLE ANGEL,

152
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,700
HE WILL BE PUTTY IN OUR HANDS.

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
IT'S HUMAN NATURE.

154
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,200
YOU PUT ONE IN YOUR ARMS,AND YOU TURN INTO A GRINNING IDIOT... 

155
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,400
LIKE THAT.

156
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,500
IN DANIEL'S DEFENSE,HE ALWAYS LOOKS LIKE THAT.

157
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,600
OH, STUPID NANNY.

158
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,700
SHE PACKED A SWEATER WITH A LOOSE BUTTON.

159
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,700
WILL YOU TAKE THIS DOWN TO THE CLOSET 

160
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,300
AND HAVE CHRISTINA SEW IT UP, PLEASE?

161
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,500
RIGHT AWAY, FRAULEIN.

162
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,100
DID YOU SAY FROWN LINE?

163
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,800
NO.

164
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,900
I CAN TAKE IT TO CHRISTINA.

165
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,700
I'M GOING DOWN THERE NOW,ANYWAY.

166
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,400
I CAN GET IT DONE IN A JIFFY!

167
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
SHE'S STRONG.

168
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
OW! SON OF A... MMM.

169
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,400
OH, YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO BUILD UP CALLUSES LIKE MINE.

170
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,300
(gasps) CHRISTINA,YOU MADE IT!

171
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,200
BRIGHT-EYED AND BUSHY-TAILED.

172
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,900
NOW WE CAN START BY LETTING ME HAVE THAT.

173
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,000
OH, NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.

174
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,300
I CAN--
NOW COME--JUST--

175
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
OH, IT'S THE, UH...

176
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,000
THE BABY'S HERE.

177
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,100
YEAH. SORRY.

178
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,200
NO, IT'S OKAY.

179
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,300
IT'S FINE.

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I CAN HANDLE IT.

181
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,900
I AM A MATURE WOMAN.

182
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,600
I JUST WISH I'D BROUGHT MY DARTS.

183
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
LET'S STAY SHARP.HARTLEY'S HERE ANY SECOND.

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,700
IT'S TIME TO GET SERIOUS, MARC.

185
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,100
PUT ON YOUR GAME FACE.

186
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,200
NOT YOUR GAY FACE--

187
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
YOUR GAME FACE.

188
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,700
THEY'RE THE SAME FACE.

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,800
YOU'RE FINE.

190
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,600
THANKS.

191
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,700
OH, COME ON!

192
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,600
HI, STEVE!

193
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,500
WRONG FLOOR.

194
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,500
COME ON.

195
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,300

196
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,100

197
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,000
WOW. HELL OF A GREETING.

198
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,200
MR. HARTLEY,SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

199
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,600
WE'RE HONORED TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

200
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,400
THANKS, BUNNY.

201
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
OH, GREAT.

202
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,600
WE'RE STILL DOING THAT. HA.

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,800
BETTY, ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

204
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
MR. HARTLEY.

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,400
CLAIRE.IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

206
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,800
UH, YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

207
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,000
FROM WAY BACK.

208
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,900
AGES AGO.

209
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,800
I'M SURPRISED YOU REMEMBERED ME.

210
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,500
IT'S SO NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

211
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,000
I AM WILHELMINA SLATER.

212
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,100
DAMN, THIS IS AN ATTRACTIVE STAFF.

213
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,800
AW... THANK YOU!

214
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,800
SHOULD WE, UH, TAKE A TOUR,OR DO YOU WANNA GO STRAIGHT TO THE OMELET BAR?

215
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,100
WHY DON'T YOU START WITHOUT ME?

216
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,000
I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON MY BABY.

217
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,100
WHA--IS THERE A BABY HERE?

218
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
CAN I SEE HIM?

219
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,600
I LOVE BABIES!

220
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,400
YOU DO?

221
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,900
ALWAYS HAVE. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN'T ASK ME FOR MONEY.

222
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,600
OVER HERE? OH.

223
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,800
RIGHT THIS WAY.YES, YES.

224
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,400
DADDY MORE-BUCKS IS KIND OF OLD, BUT HOT.

225
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,400
DO US ALL A FAVOR AND WAIT TILL AFTER HE SIGNS THE DEAL TO JUMP HIS BONES.

226
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,100
I MAKE NO PROMISES.

227
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,700
HERE HE IS.

228
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,400
IS THIS A JOKE?

229
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,300
WHAT'S GOING ON?

230
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,500
MARC, WHERE'S WILLIAM?

231
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,400
UH, HE WAS IN HERE NAPPING A MINUTE AGO.

232
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,000
HAS ANYONE SEEN THE BABY?

233
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,700
OH, MY GOD.

234
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,600
MY BABY'S GONE.

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,800
WHERE IS MY BABY?

239
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
MARC, YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE MONITORING HIM!

240
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,000
I WAS, I WAS.PPI DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING!

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,800
HE--HE WAS ONLY ALONE FOR LESS THAN A MINUTE!

242
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,400
(groans) HOW COULD YOU VVBE SO STUPID?

243
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
I'LL CALL SECURITY.

244
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,500
HAVE THEM LOCK DOWN THE BUILDING.

245
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,200
COME ON, MARC,CALL THE POLICE.
GOT IT.

246
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,900
WILHELMINA, DON'T WORRY.

247
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.

248
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,600
I KNOW WHERE RRTO START LOOKING.

249
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,500
(Betty) CHRISTINA!

250
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,200
OH! I THOUGHT SUCKING UP TO THE RICH GUY WOULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

251
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,500
WILLIAM'S BEEN KIDNAPPED.

252
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,600
WHAT? WHEN?

253
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,400
JUST NOW!

254
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,200
OH, MY GOD.

255
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,100
SHE DID IT--

256
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,700
THAT UNGRATEFUL FOREIGN WOMAN.

257
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,800
OW! WHAT--

258
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,900
(scoffs) NOT HER,THE WHITE ONE.

259
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,700
ARREST HER!

260
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,900
NO! NO. JUST GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

261
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,100
I-I DIDN'T DO IT!

262
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,800
I WAS HERE THE WHOLE TIME!

263
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,300
CHRISTINA DIDN'T DO THIS.

264
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,800
WE WILL LET THE COPS DECIDE.

265
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,000
NO ONE LEAVES HERE UNTIL THEY SPEAK TO THE POLICE.

266
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,100
THAT INCLUDES YOU.

267
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,400
BREAKING NEWS.

268
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,800
TODAY'S HOT COLOR--AMBER--

269
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,400
AS IN "ALERT."

270
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,200
THE GOLDEN CHILD OF WILHELMINA SLATER

271
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,500
AND THE LATE BRADFORD MEADE HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED.

272
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,600
ALL MEADE EMPLOYEES ARE BEING QUESTIONED.

273
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
INFORMATION IS SCARCE,

274
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,500
BUT, I, SUZUKI ST. PIERRE,HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE WITH AN EYEWITNESS.

275
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,200
OH, HEY, THERE.

276
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,200
OH, BEFORE WE START,I'LL ONLY SPEAK ON THE CONDITION OF UNANIMITY.

277
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,800
DO YOU MEAN "ANONYMITY"?

278
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,400
EXACTLY.

279
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
BUT YOU'RE ON TV.

280
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,000
EVERYONE CAN SEE YOU.

281
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,100
I KNOW.

282
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,400
OKAY, CUT. CUT.

283
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,000
TAKE FIVE.

284
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,300
I'M GETTING AN OMELET.

285
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,700
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

286
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,900
WHO WOULD KIDNAP A BABY?

287
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,100
I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST WILHELMINA TO DO IT HERSELF.

288
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,400
MOM, YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

289
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,200
BESIDES, GIVEN YOUR PAST,YOU'RE A MUCH MORE LIKELY SUSPECT.

290
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,900
YOU DIDN'T DO IT,DID YOU?

291
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,000
OH! OF COURSE NOT.

292
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,600
KIDNAPPING ISN'T MY M.O. AT ALL.

293
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,800
IT DISTURBS ME THAT MY MOTHER HAS AN M.O.

294
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,000
MR. HARTLEY.
YEAH.

295
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.

296
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'M GONNA HAVE BETTY RESCHEDULE THE PRESENTATION.

297
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,200
WHY DO WE NEED TO RESCHEDULE?

298
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,100
UH, NO,JUST BECAUSE OF--

299
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,300
YEAH, LOOK,DON'T GET ME WRONG. 

300
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,700
IT--IT BREAKS MY HEART THAT THERE'S A CHILD MISSING.

301
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,200
BUT TOMORROW MORNING,I GET ON A PLANE FOR MOSCOW.

302
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOCK THIS THING DOWN TODAY,

303
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,100
OR THAT'S IT.

304
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,700
ALL RIGHT, UM...

305
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,100
EXCUSE ME JUST A SECOND.

306
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,100
MS. SLATER SEEMS TO THINK THAT YOUR FRIEND CHRISTINA McKINNEY

307
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,400
HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF HER CHILD.

308
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,000
NO, SHE WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

309
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
SHE LOVES THAT BABY. SHE'S AS DEVASTATED AS ANYONE ELSE.

310
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
WHICH GIVES HER EVEN MORE OF A MOTIVE.

311
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
LOOK, SHE ALREADY TOLD YOU,

312
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,700
SHE WAS IN THE CLOSET THE WHOLE TIME.

313
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,500
DO YOU EVEN HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT SHE DID ANYTHING?

314
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,200
THAT'S WHY WE'RE TALKING TO YOU, MISS SUAREZ.

315
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
(sighs) DETECTIVE, I HAVE KNOWN CHRISTINA FOR YEARS.

316
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,800
THERE IS NO WAY SHE COULD'VE DONE THIS. 

317
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,300
OKAY.

318
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
YOU CAN GO.

319
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,300
BUT, UH, IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HELP,

320
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,100
HERE'S MY CARD.

321
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,200
CHRISTINA! 

322
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,000
HI, HILDA.

323
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,500
(Hilda) Archie hated the dresses.

324
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,800
HE SAYS THEY'RE TOO FANCY.

325
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,100
HE WANTS TO REPRESENT HIMSELF AS A MAN OF THE PEOPLE

326
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
AND DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE THE NEXT SARAH PALIN.

327
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,700
HILDA, CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER?

328
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,400
WE'RE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EMERGENCY.

329
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,900
OKAY, WHAT IS THE EMERGENCY?

330
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,700
STRIPES ARE OVER?

331
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,000
NO, WILHELMINA'S BABY'S BEEN KIDNAPPED.

332
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,700
OH... GOD. THEN WHAT ARE YOU TALKING TO ME FOR?

333
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,900
Go! Go!

334
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,600
AMANDA, DO YOU KNOW WHERE CHRISTINA IS?

335
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
BETTY, WHEN I MARRY MR. HARTLEY,

336
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,200
I'M GONNA BE YOUR MOM.

337
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,900
UH, AMANDA, I NEED YOU TO FOCUS RIGHT NOW.

338
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,900
DON'T TALK TO YOUR MOTHER THAT WAY. GO TO YOUR ROOM.

339
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,100
AMANDA, DO YOU OR DO YOU NOT KNOW WHERE CHRISTINA IS?

340
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,700
FINE. SHE JUST LEFT.

341
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
THE POLICE RELEASED HER?

342
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,900
I GUESS. SHE DID SEEM PRETTY UPSET.

343
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,400
WELL, OF COURSE SHE'S UPSET. 

344
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,700
THE BABY IS MISSING,AND EVERYONE'S ACCUSING HER.

345
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,800
WILL YOU TELL DANIEL I'LL BE BACK?

346
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,000
(sighs) THEY GROW UP SO FAST.

347
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,800
OKAY?

348
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,300
CHRISTINA!

349
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,800
CHRISTINA, WAIT!

350
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,100
BETTY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

351
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,300
WAS THAT STUART?

352
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,600
YEAH, I'M JUST TAKING HIS CAR HOME.

353
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,500
I KINDA NEEDED TO GET OUT OF THERE.

354
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,400
YEAH, I KNOW. YOU'RE UPSET.

355
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,800
BUT DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE DRIVING?

356
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,200
BETTY, I'LL BE FINE, REALLY.

357
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,700
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

358
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,900
JUST GO BACK TO WORK.

359
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,400
NO, NO, I CAN GO BACK IN A MINUTE.

360
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,100
BETTY,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

361
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,800
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE OKAY.

362
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,700
WELL, I AM.I'M--I'M OKAY.I'M OKAY.

363
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
NO, CHRISTINA,YOU DON'T SEEM OKAY.YOU SEEM REALLY WORRIED,

364
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,400
AND I DON'T BLAME YOU.

365
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
CHRISTINA,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

366
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,400
I JUST--I NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

367
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,500
CHRISTINA!

368
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,700
YOU TOOK THE BABY!

369
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,000
CHRISTINA,HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

370
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,200
I DON'T KNOW!

371
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,800
WHEN YOU TOLD ME THE BABY WAS IN THE OFFICE,I-I JUST SNAPPED.

372
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,600
AND THEN WHEN EVERYONE WENT TO THE ELEVATOR,

373
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,600
I JUST TOOK HIM,AND THEN I CALLED STUART.

374
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,400
YOU KNOW, I DEFENDED YOU TO THE POLICE

375
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,600
I'M A PART OF THIS NOW.

376
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,000
I'M ACCOMPLICE TO A KIDNAPPING.

377
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,200
BETTY, IT'S NOT A KIDNAPPING WHEN IT'S YOUR OWN SON.

378
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,600
IT'S NOT YOUR CHILD.

379
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,300
CHRISTINA, THERE WAS A TEST.

380
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,000
THE BABY IS WILHELMINA'S!

381
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,800
AND YOU THINK THAT WILHELMINA IS NOT CAPABLE OF--

382
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,900
OF FAKING A D.N.A. TEST?

383
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,100
BETTY, SHE NEEDS THAT CHILD  TO HOLD ON TO HER PLACE AT MEADE.

384
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
THIS IS INSANE.

385
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,400
THIS IS CRAZY.WE HAVE TO GO BACK.

386
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,300
YOU HAVE TO RETURN THE BABY.

387
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,500
I CAN'T. I CAN'T GO BACK.

388
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,800
THEY'LL ARREST ME.

389
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,800
OH! OH, GOD. 

390
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,000
OH, I'M SO SORRY. I DIDN'TMEAN FOR YOU TO GET INVOLVED.

391
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,000
 AND THIS CHART CLEARLY SHOWS THE FOURTH-QUARTER PROJECTIONS.

392
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,500
SO AS YOU CAN SEE,EVEN IN A BAD ECONOMY,

393
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,300
MODE"" SALES HAVE INCREASED."

394
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,200
WE'VE ALREADY LINED UP KATE BECKINSALE,PENELOPE CRUZ, ANNE HATHAWAY

395
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,300
FOR THE FALL COVER--

396
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,300
IS THIS A JOKE?

397
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,400
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MY CHILD!

398
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,000
HATHAWAY--SHE, UM, SHE'S HOT.

399
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,700
SORRY. UH, I MEAN,SHE'S HOT RIGHT NOW.

400
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,200
I'M SORRY.

401
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,000
MR. HARTLEY... THIS DEAL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME,

402
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,400
BUT, UH, MY PARTNER'S SON HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED--

403
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,500
MY HALF BROTHER.

404
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,200
SO YOU'RE ASKING IF YOU CAN RESCHEDULE,

405
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,600
EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU THIS IS THE ONLY TIMEI CAN DO THIS?

406
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,900
YES, I AM.

407
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,300
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

408
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,400
I'M GONNA MAKE TIME BEFORE MY FLIGHT TOMORROW MORNING.

409
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,300
HI.

410
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,900
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION, PLEASE.

411
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,200
WE'VE GOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE.

412
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,700
YOUR TAILLIGHT IS OUT.

413
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,500
OH. JUST THE TAILLIGHT?

414
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,600
IS ROAD SAFETY A JOKE TO YOU?

415
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,400
NO, MA'AM. ACTUALLY,I WAS SALLY THE SAFETY DUCK ALL THROUGH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

416
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,900
WAIT HERE.

417
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,700
CHRISTINA, CAN WE PLEASE JUST TAKE WILLIAM BACK BEFORE THIS GETS WORSE?

418
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,100
BETTY, HE'S MY SON.

419
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,000
CHRISTINA!

420
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,300
NO, LOOK, LOOK.

421
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,000
OKAY, IT'S A PICTURE OF WILLIAM.

422
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,400
IT'S A PICTURE OF ME AS A BABY.

423
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,000
BETTY, YOU KNOW ME.

424
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,500
YOU--YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING 

425
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,900
AS CRAZY AS THIS IF I WASN'T 100% SURE.

426
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,900
PLEASE?

427
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,100
I'M GONNA LET YOU OFF WITH A WARNING,

428
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,700
BUT ONLY IF YOU PROMISE TO GET THAT TAILLIGHT FIXED.

429
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,500
I PROMISE.

430
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,500
WHOSE BABY IS THIS?

431
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,300
(Betty and Christina) MINE.

432
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,900
OURS.

433
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,200
THE BABY IS OURS.

434
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,300
WILL BOTH YOU LADIES STEP OUT OF THE CAR, PLEASE?

435
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,000
AROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE CAR, PLEASE, MA'AM.

436
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,700
YOU, TOO, MISS.AROUND TO THE FRONT.

437
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,600
WHAT WERE YOU LADIES THINKING?

438
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,400


439
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,600
TH THE LaCORTE INFANT CAR SEAT,

440
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,400
YOU GOTTA USE THE LOCKING CLIP.

441
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,700
IT'S SAFER. (laughs) MY PARTNER AND I HAVE THE SAME ONE.

442
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,300
THE CAR SEAT,NOT THE BABY. 

443
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,600
ALL RIGHT,HAVE A GOOD ONE, LADIES.

444
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,300
OKAY.

445
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,400
OH, BETTY,THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

446
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,200
CHRISTINA, LOOK, I BELIEVE YOU, OKAY?

447
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,000
YEAH.BUT THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THINGS.

448
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,600
I JUST WISH YOU WOULD'VE COME TO ME FIRST.

449
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,500
NEXT TIME.

450
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,000
LET'S JUST GET SOMEWHERE SAFE SO WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

451
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,100
JEEZ,I CAN'T READ THIS WATCH.

452
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,500
LET'S JUST SAY HOUR FOUR OF THE SLATER-MEADE KIDNAPPING.

453
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,000
NOW THE FUZZ HAVE BEEN A LITTLE STINGY ABOUT THE DETAILS,

454
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,200
SO WE'RE FORCED TO CONFINE OUR REPORTING TO GOOD, 

455
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,500
OLD-FASHIONED WILD SPECULATION.

456
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,700
NOW THE BOYS IN THE F.X. DEPARTMENT  

457
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,100
HAVE USED AGE-PROGRESSION SOFTWARE

458
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,600
TO DETERMINE WHAT THE SPAWN OF BRADFORD MEADE

459
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,200
AND WILHELMINA SLATER WOULD LOOK LIKE BY 20.

460
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,300
MOTHER OF PEARL,THE MAN IS AN ADONIS.

461
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,300
THE WORLD CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THIS SPECIMEN.

462
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,600
IF YOU'RE OUT THERE LISTENING,

463
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,400
I MAKE THIS DEMAND OF THE KIDNAPPERS--

464
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,000
BRING HIM BACK.

465
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,700
WE'RE TALKING FASHION ROYALTY.

466
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,300
MOM! MOM.

467
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,000
I HAVE TO WATCH THIS!THIS IS MY O.J.

468
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
THEN GO WATCH IN THE KITCHEN.

469
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,300
THEY'RE ABOUT TO START SHOOTING.

470
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,700
(woman) WE'RE GONNA SET UP IN THE SALON.

471
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,800
THAT'S PERFECT, THANKS.

472
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,100
NICE WORK, GETTING THEM TO SHOOT IN MY SALON.
IT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

473
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,200
WELL, YOUR SALON IS AN EXAMPLE OF MY SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESS.

474
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,200
AND IT'S THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT THAT WILL PULL THIS COUNTRY RIGHT OUT OF--

475
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,400
YEAH, YEAH, WHATEVER.YOU ALREADY GOT MY VOTE.

476
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,400
JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET A CLEAR SHOT OF MY SIGN.

477
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
OH, OKAY.

478
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,200
HEY, THANKS FOR TONING DOWN THE OUTFIT, HUH?

479
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,500
NO PROBLEM.

480
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,600
THANK YOU FOR ASKING ME TO BE A PART OF THIS THING.

481
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,900
(woman) UM, COUNCILMAN,WE'RE READY TO CHECK YOUR MIKE.

482
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,900
OH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

483
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,200
UM, THANKS. SEE YOU IN A BIT.

484
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,000
OKAY, JUST WIPE THAT--

485
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,800
OKAY.
OKAY. (sighs)

486
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,400
...THIS DRAMA WILL UNFOLD.

487
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
THE QUESTION ON EVERYONE'S MIND IS,

488
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,100
WHERE IN THE WORLD IS THAT KIDNAPPED BABY?

489
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,500
IF THE BABY SNATCHERS HAVE ANY SENSE OF DECENCY AT ALL,

490
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,000
THEY'LL TAKE THE GENETICALLY BLESSED BAMBINO TO...

491
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,300
YOU ARE KIDDING ME.

492
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,500
WE FOUND THIS FROM THE SECURITY CAMERA IN THE STAIRWELL.

493
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,800
I BROUGHT IT TO YOU FIRST,AS PER OUR USUAL AGREEMENT.

494
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,100
HIT IT.

495
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,700
UH, COULD YOU PAUSE,PLEASE?

496
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,200
UM, TROY, MAY WE HAVE A MOMENT ALONE?

497
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,800
COME ON, YOU.

498
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
WHO'S THAT?

499
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,900
THAT IS CHRISTINA'S HUSBAND STUART.

500
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,500
(gasps) GREAT SCOTT!

501
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,700
I'M SORRY. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SAY THAT.

502
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,400
SO SHE REALLY DID TAKE THE BABY.

503
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,800
OH, SO THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

504
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,900
THE BABY'S SAFE.

505
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,700
NOW ALL WE NEED TO FIND CHRISTINA IS A TEAM OF BOOZE-SNIFFING HOUNDS.

506
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,800
WIL, IT'S OKAY. CHRISTINA WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING TO HURT LITTLE WILLIAM.

507
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,300
IN A FEW HOURS,HE'LL BE BACK SAFE AND SOUND 

508
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,500
IN HIS NANNY'S ARMS.

509
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,200
WE DON'T HAVE A FEW HOURS.

510
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,600
IF CHRISTINA HAS THE BABY,THEN THE TRUTH IS GOING TO GET OUT.

511
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,000
WHAT TRUTH ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

512
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,400
I HAD THE D.N.A. TEST FAKED.

513
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,200
THE BABY'S NOT MINE.

514
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,900
IT'S CHRISTINA'S.

515
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,000
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

516
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
YOU FAKED THE D.N.A. TEST IN ORDER TO CLAIM CHRISTINA'S BABY AS YOUR OWN.

517
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,400
THE BIGGER PICTURE, FOOL.

518
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,000
IF IT GETS OUT THAT THIS BABY IS NOT MINE,

519
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,100
I LOSE MY CLAIM TO THE MEADE FORTUNE.

520
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,200
I'M FIRED, AND YOU ALONG WITH ME.

521
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,100
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

522
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,900
WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHERE THAT BABY IS SO THEY DON'T DISCOVER THE TRUTH.

523
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,700
HOW? CHRISTINA COULD BE ANYWHERE.

524
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,800
OKAY. I'M A SCOTTISH SEAMSTRESS/KIDNAPPER 

525
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,500
AND I HAVE A PASTY COMPLEXION.

526
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,400
WHERE DO I TURN?

527
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,300
YOU WOULD TURN TO YOUR BEST FRIEND.

528
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,000
BETTY.
BETTY.

529
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,000
OH, MY GOD. YOU GUYS ARE THE KIDNAPPERS?

530
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,200
I TOTALLY CALLED THAT. 

531
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,400
SHH! NO, WE'RE NOT KIDNAPPERS. 

532
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
WELL, OKAY, TECHNICALLY,WE'RE KIDNAPPERS,

533
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,300
BUT IT--IT'S VERY COMPLICATED.

534
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,400
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

535
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,700
 I GOTTA  GO TELL ALL MY FRIENDS

536
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,300
WHOA, YOU GO UP TO YOUR ROOM AND YOU DON'T SAY A WORD.

537
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,100
YOU GOT THAT?

538
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,000
BUT ALL THIS DRAMA--I CAN'T EVEN TELL THE DRAMA CLUB?

539
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,900
ZIP.

540
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,300
FINE.

541
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,900
YOU GUYS GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

542
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,300
IF REPORTERS THINK THAT ARCHIE HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS,

543
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,300
HIS CAREER IS THROUGH,AND THEN WE ARE THROUGH.

544
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,700
HILDA, JUST KEEP THEM IN THE SALON.

545
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,900
WE'LL SNEAK UP THE STAIRS.

546
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,400
THEY'LL NEVER EVEN KNOW WE WERE HERE.

547
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,900
ARE YOU CRAZY? YOU CAN'T STAY IN THE HOUSE.

548
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,300
WELL, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

549
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,000
I DON'T CARE. I JUST DON'T WANT ARCHIE TO SEE YOU HERE.

550
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,800
HILDA? IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

551
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,800
(chuckles) YEAH.

552
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,300
EVERYTHING IS GREAT.NEVER BETTER!

553
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,300
FINE, I WILL DISTRACT THEM.

554
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,900
BUT THIS ISN'T OVER.

555
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,400
(Hilda) OKAY, EVERYBODY!

556
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,000
LET'S GET THOSE CAMERAS ROLLING.
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS.

557
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,700
HOW ABOUT EVERYBODY FACES ME AS I STAND AGAINST THE WINDOW?

558
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,300
OH, HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN ARCHIE'S POSTER,

559
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,800
HOW HANDSOME HE IS?

560
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,700
COME ON, STOP.

561
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,800
OH, NO, THAT'S GREAT.

562
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,000
WHY DON'T WE USE WHILE WE'RE--

563
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,500
YOU KNOW WHAT? ACTUALLY,I PREFER THE WINDOW.

564
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,900
I LIKE TO BE BACKLIT.

565
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,300
IT'S VERY... SPIELBERG.

566
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,700
WAS THAT A BABY?

567
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,100
NO, THAT WAS JUSTIN, MY SON.

568
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,800
MEGAN FOX AND BRIAN AUSTIN GREEN BROKE UP AGAIN.

569
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,300
HE WAS REALLY PULLING FOR THEM, SO HE'S JUST...

570
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,400
WELL, HERE'S WHAT I WAS THINKING IS THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY

571
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,700
COME THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR...

572
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,500
AND THEN WE CAN SHOW THAT WE'RE INSIDE A HOUSE.

573
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,100
YOU KNOW, YOU WANNA GO OUT THE FRONT DOOR?

574
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,400
YOU KNOW WHAT?I JUST HAD AN IDEA--GENIUS.

575
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,300
ARCHIE, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD REALLY SHOW THEM?

576
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,700
THE YIELD SIGN YOU HAD INSTALLED DOWN THE BLOCK.

577
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,000
WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO SEE A YIELD SIGN?

578
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,200
BECAUSE IT WAS YOUR FIRST ACT AS COUNCILMAN.

579
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,900
FIRST SMALL STEP ON THE WAY TO GREATNESS.

580
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,500
ACTUALLY, I LOVE IT.

581
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,600
IF YOU WERE SMART, YOU'D HIREHER AS YOUR PUBLICIST.

582
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,400
WELL, O-OKAY.

583
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,200
SEE? COME ON.

584
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,400
I'LL SHOW YOU THE SIGN.

585
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,000
BEFORE IT WAS THERE,THERE WAS NO YIELDING.

586
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,200
IT WAS CHAOS. YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

587
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,400
HE HAS SAVED THE DAY--

588
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,700
ARCHIE RODRIGUEZ.

589
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,600
YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE TO TELL ME, MIJA?

590
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,400
OH, HI, STUART.

591
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,900
I'M AFRAID WE'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A DETOUR.

592
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,300
KIDNAPPING. AY, DIOS MIO.

593
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,100
THAT'S GOTTA BE, LIKE,10,000 HAIL MARYS.

594
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,900
PAPI--

595
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,800
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ASKED WHERE YOU SHOULD DRAW THE LINE WHEN HELPING A FRIEND?

596
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
YOU JUST CROSSED IT.

597
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,000
HILDA, WE HAD NO OTHER OPTIONS.

598
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,300
PAPI, YOU UNDERSTAND,RIGHT?

599
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,100
I'M TRYING TO.

600
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,100
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA DISCUSS THE FACT THAT YOU KIDNAPPED A BABY, 

601
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,400
BUT THEN TO BRING HIM HERE WITH ARCHIE'S CAMPAIGN ON THE LINE?

602
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,300
WHAT WAS I GONNA DO?

603
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
SHE NEEDED MY HELP.

604
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,200
I COULDN'T JUST TURN MY BACK ON HER.

605
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,500
BUT, BETTY, SHE DIDN'T JUST JUMP A SUBWAY TURNSTILE.

606
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
THIS IS KIDNAPPING!

607
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,500
I KNOW, BUT SHE THINKSTHAT BABY IS HERS,AND I BELIEVE HER.

608
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,500
MIJA, EVEN IF IT IS,WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO?

609
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,900
I DON'T KNOW. GET ANOTHER D.N.A. TEST, SOMETHING.

610
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,100
OKAY, SO WE JUST MAYBEDROP BY THE D.N.A. PAGODAAT THE MALL.

611
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,400
OKAY, HILDA, OKAY.

612
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,600
I GET IT. WE NEED HELP.

613
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,600
YEAH, BUT WHO'S GONNA HELP A FUGITIVE 

614
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,300
MODE MAGAZINE.

615
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,000
OH, HEY, BETTY. YES,

616
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'LL CONNECT YOU TO CLAIRE.

617
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,200
OW! MY HAIR!

618
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,900
(whispers) SORRY.
Hello. This is Claire.

619
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,200
(Betty) Mrs. Meade,I really need your help.

620
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
BETTY, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING BY CALLING ME.

621
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,700
DR. GELOBTER IS A CLOSE FRIEND.

622
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,700
HE'LL GET THE TEST DONE QUICKLY AND QUIETLY.

623
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH,MRS. MEADE.

624
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,200
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU STICKING YOUR NECK OUT LIKE THIS FOR US.

625
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,000
WELL, BETTY'S HELPED ME MANY TIMES IN THE PAST.

626
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,100
I'M ONLY TOO HAPPY TO RETURN THE FAVOR.

627
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,600
AND ONCE WE PROVE THAT THIS BABY ISN'T WILHELMINA'S,

628
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,900
WE'LL FINALLY BE ABLE TO GET RID OF THAT BITCH.

629
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,400
(man) POLICE.

630
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,500
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

631
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,300
(man) PUT DOWN THE BABY!

632
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,100
PUT YOUR HANDS UP!DON'T MOVE!

633
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,500
(man) MA'AM, HAND OVER THE BABY NOW.

634
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,000
GIVE UP THE BABY.

635
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,100
GET BACK! GET YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

636
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
LET'S SEE THOSE HANDS.

637
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
NO, NO!

638
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,300
(man) YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.

639
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,900
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW.

640
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,200
SO IN THEORY,IF YOU HADN'T STOPPED US,

641
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,700
WE'D ALREADY KNOW THE TRUE IDENTITY OF THE BABY'S MOTHER.

642
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,500
IN FACT, WE WERE JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU RESOLVE THE SITUATION.

643
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,600
HEY, LADY, YOU CAN STOP TALKING, HUH? WE GET IT.

644
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,900
YOU'VE BEEN FREE TO GO FOR 15 MINUTES.

645
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,900
YOUR FRIEND OVER THERE HAS GOT A GOOD LAWYER.

646
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,500

DANIEL??THAT THE BABY IS HERS.

650
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,700
DANIEL, I BELIEVE HER.

651
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,800
COME ON, YOU HAVE TO TALK TO WILHELMINA.

652
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,200
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP.

653
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,400
(Claire) JUST DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.

654
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,500
THAT WOMAN WON'T GIVE UP ANYTHING UNLESS YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ON HER.

655
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,100
WILHELMINA, WE ARE IN FRONT OF A D.N.A. FACILITY.

656
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,500
WHAT HARM COULD IT POSSIBLY DO?

657
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,200
I AM NOT GONNA INDULGE THE LUNATIC WHO TOOK MY SON

658
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,500
JUST TO GIVE HER PEACE OF MIND.

659
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,500
I KNOW.
I-I'M JUST SAYING,THEN WE'D BE DONE WITH THIS WHOLE UGLY SITUATION.

660
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,600
WE COULD PUT IT BEHIND US.

661
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,900
I TOOK THE TEST ALREADY.

662
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,500
IT PROVED THAT HE WAS MY SON.

663
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,300
I KNOW.

664
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,800
JUST BECAUSE SHE'S NOT HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS,

665
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,200
I SHOULD SUBMIT TO ANOTHER ONE?

666
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
LOOK, DANIEL,SHE STOLE MY SON.

667
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,500
LORD KNOWS WHERE SHE COULD'VE TAKEN HIM.

668
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,100
AND YOU WANT ME TO HAVE SYMPATHY FOR HER?

669
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,400
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,SHE CAN ROT IN JAIL.

670
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,800
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO.

671
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,600
WE'RE IN HANDCUFFS IN THE BACK OF A POLICE CAR, BETTY.

672
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,200
I THINK WE MIGHT BE OUT OF OPTIONS.

673
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,000
NO, WE'RE NOT.

674
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,700
WE COULD GET A COURT ORDER OR... SOMETHING.

675
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,400
WE CAN MAKE THIS RIGHT.

676
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,200
I DON'T KNOw WHAT I WAS THINKING...

677
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,300
TAKING ON WILHELMINA SLATER.

678
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,700
I DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

679
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,400
CHRISTINA...

680
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,900
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND,BETTY.

681
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,300
I JUST WANTED HIM TO HAVE A HAPPY LIFE.

682
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,600
THAT'S ALL.

683
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,500
(man) MA'AM, WOULD YOU PLEASE STEP AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE?

684
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,200
I MADE A FEW MORE BOTTLES,AND THEY'RE IN THE REFRIGERATOR,

685
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,600
AND THE NANNY SHOULD BE HERE AT 7:00 TO TAKE OVER.

686
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
THANK YOU, MARC.

687
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,700
IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE?

688
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,800
N-NO.

689
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,700
UM, JUST...

690
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,900
CONGRATULATIONS, I GUESS.

691
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,400
YOU DID IT.

692
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,200
AS FAR AS ANYONE KNOWS,THE BABY IS YOURS.

693
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,100
THE BABY IS MINE, MARC.

694
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,100
OF COURSE HE IS. UM...

695
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,700
AND YOUR POSITION AT THE COMPANY IS SECURE.

696
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,800
AND CHRISTINA IS GOING TO JAIL.

697
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,300
WIN-WIN.

698
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,000
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,

699
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,600
WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME OUT AND SAY IT? 

700
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,400
I...

701
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,700
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT,WILHELMINA.

702
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,500
GOOD NIGHT, MARC.

703
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,400
I'M SORRY, HILDA.

704
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,000
I SHOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT THEM HERE.

705
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,500
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

706
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,600
MM. IT'S JUST A GOOD THING THAT ARCHIE DIDN'T FIND OUT.

707
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,800
IF HE THOUGHT THAT YOU BROUGHT A KIDNAPPED BABY HERE WITH A NEWS CREW

708
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,100
FOLLOWING HIM AROUND...

709
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,600
(laughs) HE WOULD BE SO, SO--

710
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,700
I WOULD BE SO... WHAT?

711
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,400
CUTE.

712
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
YOU ARE SO CUTE.

713
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,500
DID YOU CHANGE TIES?

714
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,300
BECAUSE IT IS--IT IS CUTE.

715
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,100
IT IS WORKING FOR ME.SEXY. I LIKE IT.

716
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,700
HILDA, I KNOW.

717
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,500
(scoffs) CONCEITED!

718
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
BUT STILL CUTE.

719
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,200
JUSTIN TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

720
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,800
(chuckles) HE'S ALWAYS MAKING UP STORIES.

721
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,700
HE'S VERY CREATIVE.

722
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,200
HILDA, STOP. LOOK, SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, ARCHIE.

723
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,300
IT WAS ME. IT WAS MY FAULT.

724
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
I WASN'T TRYING TO ENDANGER YOUR CAMPAIGN.

725
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,300
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP MY FRIEND.

726
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,800
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

727
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,900
I THINK THAT'S NOBLE.

728
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,100
WHAT? YOU WERE STRESSING ABOUT WHAT DRESS I WAS GONNA WEAR,

729
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,600
BUT NOW YOU'RE OKAY WITH KIDNAPPING?

730
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,300
OKAY, OKAY, TO BE CLEAR, AS CANDIDATE FOR QUEENS BOROUGH PRESIDENT,

731
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,700
I AM NOT OKAY WITH KIDNAPPING, BUT...

732
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,400
AS YOUR FRIEND,

733
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT.

734
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,200
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT'S RIGHT,BECAUSE WILHELMINA WON.

735
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,400
DID YOU TRY FIGHTING DIRTY?

736
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,700
EXCUSE ME?

737
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
WELL, I'M--I'M JUST SAYING,

738
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,500
WE ALL WANT TO PLAY BY THE RULES,

739
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,300
BUT SOMETHING I'VE LEARNED IN CITY POLITICS IS,

740
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,400
WELL, TO GET WHAT YOU WANT, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T HURT TO BE A LITTLE... CREATIVE.

741
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,600
I KNOW THE TRUTH.

742
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,000
AND, UH, WHAT TRUTH DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW?

743
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,100
THAT BABY DOESN'T BELONG WITH YOU.

744
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,400
AND THAT AUBERGINE FAUX FUR DOESN'T BELONG WITH ANYTHING.

745
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,200
YET HERE WE ARE.

746
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,100
I CAN PROVE IT.

747
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,500
YOU SEE THIS? THIS STAIN IS THE BABY'S SPIT-UP.

748
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,100
AND WHEN I GET IT TESTED, IT'S GONNA PROVE THAT THE BABY IS CHRISTINA'S,

749
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,000
AND YOU WILL GO TO JAIL.

750
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,600
OR...

751
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,800
YOU CAN ADMIT THAT THE BABY ISN'T YOURS,

752
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,800
AND WE CAN CHALK UP THAT FAKE D.N.A. TEST TO A MISTAKE.

753
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,700
YOUR CHOICE.

754
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,200
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT ME.

755
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,400
YES.

756
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
YES, I DO.

757
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,300
SO WE SHOULD GIVE THAT ENCHANTING POLY-BLEND THING TO YOUR LAB?

758
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,300
AND WHEN THE D.N.A. RESULTS COME BACK AND THEY SAY STRAWBERRY MILKSHAKE,

759
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,900
THEN WHAT? 

760
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,400
BABY SPIT-UP AND MILKSHAKE ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COLORS.

761
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,500
OH, COME ON, BETTY.

762
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,700
I'M A FASHION EXPERT.

763
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,800
I NOTICE EVERYTHING.

764
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,600
IT'S A GIFT AND A CURSE.

765
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,100
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

766
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,200
I DON'T HAVE D.N.A. EVIDENCE.

767
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,100
BUT I'M NOT GIVING UP.

768
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,700
I DON'T HAVE YOUR MONEY, AND I DON'T HAVE YOUR POWER,

769
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,500
BUT I KNOW THE TRUTH, AND I WILL FIGHT UNTIL IT COMES OUT.

770
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
WILHELMINA, EVEN YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO LIE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

771
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,000
IT WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER TO JUST TELL THE TRUTH NOW.

772
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,100
WHEN I DISCOVERED THE ERROR IN THE D.N.A. TEST,

773
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:00,100
I WAS DEVASTATED, BUT I KNEW I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING.

774
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,400
BECAUSE WHILE I KNEW I'D BE LOSING MY BABY,

775
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,600
THERE WAS SIMPLY NO WAY I COULD KEEP A CHILD FROM HIS REAL MOTHER.

776
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,200
IN A FINAL TWIST, IT TURNS OUT 

777
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,100
THE BABY APPEARS NOT TO BE THE SCION OF BRADFORD MEADE

778
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,400
AND WILHELMINA SLATER--

779
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,100
BOO-HOO--BUT RATHER SOME KID FROM A COUPLE OF SCOTTISH PEOPLE.

780
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,500
NOW GIVEN THIS NEW INFORMATION, WE'VE HAD TO REVISE OUR PREVIOUS DEPICTION

781
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,400
OF WHAT THE BABY WOULD LOOK LIKE AT 20.

782
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,800
DEAR LORD.

783
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,900
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS A SHAME THAT THIS KIDNAPPING STORY

784
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
HAS COME TO SUCH A TRAGIC CONCLUSION.

785
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE WILHELMINA TOLD THE TRUTH.

786
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
YES, THE WOMAN'S A SAINT.

787
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,000
OH, ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT HER SHARES IN THE COMPANY ARE LITTLE WILLIAM'S,

788
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,200
AND WITHOUT THE BABY, SHE'S GOT NOTHING.

789
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,200
AND I DON'T CARE HOW TALENTED SHE IS.

790
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,400
YOU KEEP A COBRA AROUND LONG ENOUGH, EVENTUALLY THEY BITE.

791
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,200
MOM'S RIGHT.

792
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,300
WILHELMINA'S PROVEN TIME AND AGAIN SHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

793
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,100
LET ME FIRE HER.

794
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,100
NO. I'M GONNA DO IT.

795
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,300
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.

796
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,100
FINE.

797
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,600
BUT I WANT TO SEE TEARS.

798
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,800
MR. HARTLEY BEFORE WE SIGN THE PAPERWORK,

799
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,000
THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BUSINESS WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF.

800
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,500
WILHELMINA, AHEM, CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU?

801
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,600
YOU'RE FIRED.

802
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,600
UH, I'M SORRY.I COULDN'T HELP IT.

803
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,600
SERIOUSLY?

804
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,400
YOUR TIME AT MEADE IS OVER.

805
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,000
WELL, THAT IS A SHAME.

806
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
LET'S GO, GUYS.

807
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,500
WAIT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

808
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,500
IF YOU'RE GONNA FIRE WILHELMINA, I'M OUT.

809
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,300
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MR. HARTLEY,

810
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,600
THIS IS AN INTERNAL PERSONNEL MATTER.

811
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,100
BUT I HAVE AN OPINION.

812
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,500
I THOUGHT WE AGREED YOU'D BE A SILENT PARTNER.

813
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,100
WELL, YOU'LL FIND THAT SOMETIMES I'M NOT SO SILENT.

814
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,900
SHE'S A SHARK.SHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

815
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,000
SON, I THINK A SHARK IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED

816
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,700
TO BALANCE THINGS OUT AROUND HERE.

817
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,000
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

818
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,900
LOOK, YOU'RE A STAND-UP GUY, DANIEL,

819
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,100
AND THAT'S GREAT,

820
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,800
BUT I CAN'T HAVE YOU HOPPING OFF TO YOUR BUNNY HOLE EVERY TIME A PROBLEM COMES UP.

821
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,900
I OWN COMPANIES IN COLOMBIA,INDIA, BRAZIL.

822
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,900
IF I STOPPED DOING BUSINESS EVERY TIME SOMEBODY GOT KIDNAPPED,

823
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,500
I'D NEVER GET ANYTHING DONE.

824
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,500
SO EITHER MS. SLATER KEEPS HER STAKE IN THE COMPANY

825
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,800
AND HER JOB,OR I WALK.

826
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,300
PLEASURE. CLAIRE.

827
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,200
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

828
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,200
(man) GOOD. FOR YOU.

829
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,900
I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST.

830
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
OKAY, NEVER MIND.

831
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,600
(sighs) GLAD TO SEE YOU,BETTY.

832
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,000
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO THANK YOU.

833
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
WHAT FOR?

834
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
FOR THE PLUCKY LITTLE THREAT YOU MADE.

835
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,400
YOU WERE RIGHT.

836
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,100
THE TRUTH ALWAYS COMES OUT.

837
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,000
AND WHEN YOU MENTIONED THAT IT WOULD BE EASIER NOT TO HAVE TO LIE

838
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,700
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

839
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,200
I TOOK THAT QUITE TO HEART.

840
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,600
IF YOU'RE GOING TO INVEST IN THIS COMPANY,

841
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
I THINK YOU NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT ME.

842
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,500
WHAT IS THAT?

843
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,500
I'M THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO STOLE A DEAD MAN'S SPERM,

844
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,500
WHO FALSIFIED D.N.A. RESULTS,WHO KEPT A MOTHER IN THE DARK

845
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,800
JUST TO MAINTAIN THE ILLUSION THAT HER BABY WAS MINE--

846
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,900
ALL OF THIS TO ENSURE MY PLACE IN THIS COMPANY.

847
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,700
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME ALL THIS?

848
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,200
BECAUSE I'M SOMEONE YOU NEED ON YOUR SIDE,

849
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,200
WORKING FOR YOU AS OPPOSED TO AN ENEMY...

850
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,500
WORKING AGAINST YOU.

851
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,700
YOU ENCOURAGED ME TO TELL THE TRUTH,

852
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,100
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, HARTLEY DECIDED TO KEEP ME ON.

853
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,400
SO THANK YOU AGAIN.

854
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,500
OH, AND WHEN CHRISTINA COMES BACK, WOULD YOU BE A DEAR AND BRING THE BABY TO HER?

855
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,100
I THINK IT'D BE BEST IF SHE AND I DIDN'T SEE EACH OTHER.

856
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,500
BRAVO, WILHEL-MAESTRO.

857
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,100
BRAVO.

858
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,400
WHO'S THAT?

859
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,800
IT'S YOUR MOMMY.

860
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,600
(whispers) HELLO.

861
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,800
THERE'S MOMMY.

862
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,600
AND I'M YOUR DADDY.

863
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,100
YES, YES.
HEY, LITTLE GUY.

864
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,700
HEY.

865
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,400
BETTY...

866
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,400
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

867
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,600
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

868
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,300
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE YOU FIRST GOT TO "MODE."

869
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,600
I MEAN, YOU STILL DRESS THE SAME, BUT STILL, A LONG WAY.

870
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,100
IT'S BEEN REALLY LOVELY KNOWING YOU AS A FRIEND. I MEAN THAT.

871
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,900
CHRISTINA, STOP. WHY ARE YOU TALKING LIKE YOU'RE GOING AWAY?

872
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,200
CHRISTINA...

873
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,000
STUART AND I ARE GONNA GO BACK TO SCOTLAND.

874
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,300
WHAT?

875
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
WHY?

876
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,300
WE WANT TO BE CLOSER TO OUR FAMILIES SO THE WEE ONE CAN GET TO KNOW THEM.

877
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,600
PLUS, I DON'T WANT HIM SPEAKING LIKE A YANK,

878
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
'CAUSE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU PEOPLE SAY. (chuckles)

879
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,600
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR CAREER?

880
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,000
WHAT ABOUT DESIGNING?

881
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,800
WHAT, YOU THINK THEY DON'T HAVE DESIGNERS IN EDINBURGH?

882
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,900
LISTEN, I'VE NOT GIVEN UP ON MY DREAM.

883
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,800
THAT WAS SOMETHING I LEARNED FROM A VERY GOOD FRIEND.

884
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,700
COME HERE.

885
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,800
I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

886
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,600
I'LL MISS YOU, TOO.

887
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:10,000
