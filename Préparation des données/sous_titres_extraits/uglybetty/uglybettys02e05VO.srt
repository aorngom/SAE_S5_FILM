00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,900
 <I>Previously On "Ugly Betty"...</I>
Justin?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,500
You're Supposed To Be Working
On Your Algebra, Not Making Out.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,300
Back Off.
You're Not My Dad.
I Miss Him So Much.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,900
I Know, <I>Mija.</I>
But It'll Get Better.
I Want To Postpone

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,700
Wilhelmina Is Losing
Her Grip On Bradford.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,300
The Bradford Meade/
Wilhelmina Slater Wedding

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,900
Is Back On.
How'd The Meeting
With The Advertiser Go?

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,700
I Think
I Lost The Account.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,600
Guy Had Some Issues
With Our Staff.
What? With Who?

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,000
You.
I Think We Should
Lose The Account.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,700
What?
We Don't Need Atlantic Attire
Or Their Money.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,700
So You Want
To Destroy "Mode"?
Well, There's Only Room

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,700
At Meade Publications.

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,300
So The Baby's Yours.
I'm Soy, Betty.

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,600
You Should Go.

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,800
Henry, I'm Sorry.
I Just Can't See You.

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,400
Not With The Way
Everything Turned Out.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,600
The Baby's Yours.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,600
You're Going Back To Tucson
To Be With Charlie.

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,000
I Am Not Going Back
To Be With Charlie.

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,500
I Am Going Back
To Be A Father To My Child.

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Maybe We Can
Still Do This.

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,300
Long Distance? It--
That'll Never Work.

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,900
I Just Think It's Better
If We Just Avoid Each Other

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,400
Until You Leave.

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,100
So That's It.
Just Like That?

27
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,300
Yes, I Think
That's What's Best.

28
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,600
Excuse Me, Do You Mind
Not Leaning On Me?
Who's Leaning On You?

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,400
Well, You See,
That's None Of Your Concern.

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,100
People Can Lean On Me
All They Want.
Okay.

31
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,800
No, Not You.
Okay, So I'm Here
For Five More Months.

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,500
How Do We Make This Work?
When You Need
Daniel's Signature, Send Kenny.

33
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Okay. What About Meals?

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,800
I Go To The Cafeteria
At 1:00.
I Guess I Can Do 12:00.

35
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,300
Except For Taco Tuesdays.
I'm Always Afraid

36
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,600
They're Gonna Run Out,
So I Have To Go Early.
Okay, Sure.

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,900
Well, Maybe This Whole
Avoidance Thing Will Work.

38
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah, We Never Have To
See Each Other At All.

39
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,100
Ugh!

丑女贝蒂 第二季第5集

41
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,000
Starting Tomorrow,
I'll Take The Subway.

42
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,000
Uh-Huh.

43
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,600
Morning.

44
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,600
Hey, Don't Fill Up On Fruit.
I'm Making <I>Machaca.</I>

45
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,200
Oh, No, I Can't Stay.
It's Thursday.

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,900
Santos And I Do
Our Lotto Scratchers

47
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,700
At The Cemetery.
Oh.

48
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,200
Hey, Kiddo.
I'm Making <I>Machaca.</I>

49
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,900
I Know You Say
It Gives You Hips But--
I'm Meeting My Friends.

50
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,400
Oh, Are You All Trying Out
For "The Music Man"?

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,700
I Read In The School Paper
Auditions Are Today.

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,300
Drama Club?
That's For Losers.

53
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,800
You're The President.
You Even Started The Club.

54
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,500
Whatever. Here.

55
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,200
Oh.

56
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,400
Okay. Bye.

57
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,600
Hey.

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,000
Do You Even Know
What You Signed?
Oh, I Don't Know, <I>Papi.</I>

59
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,000
Maybe It Was
For Mail-Order Crack.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Come On, It Was
A Permission Slip For Something.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,500
It's Fine. Bye.

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,900
Did You Get It?

63
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,000
One Note Excusing Me
From The Field Trip Tomorrow.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,500
Yeah, Suck That,
Queens County Farm Museum.

65
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,700
So What
Are We Gonna Do?

66
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,600
We'll Take My Family's Car
Out For A Ride.

67
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,100
My Dad Taught Me
How To Drive.

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,000
Car Thieves Are Hot.

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,100
Marc Jacobs Wants To Send
Over Bags. I Said Yes.

70
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,000
Kathy Griffin Is Begging
For A Date. I Said No.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,400
And Your Father Wants To Have
You And Alexis Over For Dinner

72
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,900
With Him And Wilhelmina.
I Didn't Know What To Say.

73
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,100
Great. I Get To Spend Time
With My Futurestep-Monster.

74
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,700
One Big Crappy Family.
A Grudging "Yes" It Is.
Speaking Of Which,

75
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,700
Your Step-Monster Has Called
A Meeting In Her Office

76
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,100
In 30 Seconds.
Wait, Is That Why
We're Headed This Way?

77
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,800
I Was Hoping We Were
Going To Get Danish.

78
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,600
Are You Really
That Good,

79
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,100
Or Did You Just Happen
To Have That On You?

80
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,200
You'll Never Know. Oh.

81
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,000
Are You Okay With This?

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,500
You Can Skip The Meeting
If You Want.

83
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,500
No, I Won't Let This
Get In The Way Of My Job.

84
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,700
I'm A Professional.

85
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,900
Besides, It's Not Like
I'm Writing "Betty Loves Henry"

86
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,300
All Over My Notebook.

87
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,600
Um, You--
Shut Up.

88
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,900
(Wilhelmina) Thank You
For Joining Us, Daniel.

89
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
Why Are You In Here? Where Are
All The Other Departments?

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
Oh, I Only Invited Ad Sales
And Accounting.

91
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,300
I Figured It'd Be Easier

92
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,300
To Discuss
The Advertising Situation

93
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,600
In A Smaller,
Le Judgmental Group.
(Whispering) Excuse Me,

94
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,900
Over There To That Chair?
Well, That's Very Thoughtful
Of You, Wilhelmina,

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But I Really Don't Have
Anything To Hide.

96
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,100
I've Been Very Open
About This Whole Thing.

97
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,800
And If You Could Just Move
To That Chair. It's Empty.

98
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,000
I Think We All Know
Atlantic Attire

99
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,000
Pulled Their Advertising
From "Mode."
(Normal Voice) No, No, No.

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,700
I Didn't Mean You.
I Meant Him.
Betty? Please.

101
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,100
Oh, You--You Didn't Know?

102
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,800
Uh, Once The News Leaked

103
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,000
That Atlantic Attire
Was Pulling Out,

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
Well,
Other Companies Followed.

105
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,000
Just How Many Advertisers
Are We Talking About?

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,700
Well,
As Of This Morning,

107
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,400
Um... 52%.

108
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,200
(Low Voice) Your Foot
Just Touched My Knee.

109
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,300
(Low Voice) Your Knee
Just Touched My Foot.
Well, Here's The Line.

110
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,200
So What's
Our Financial Outlook?

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,800
Well, Uh,
If We Keep Touching--

112
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,500
Spending
At The Current Rate,

113
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,600
Then "Mode" Will Be
Out Of Business In 90 Days.

114
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,200
(Yoga) Yo, Fish!

115
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,600
You Staying In Here All Day
Or We Gon' Play Tennis?

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,900
Yoga,
I've Been Drinking--

117
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,300
I Mean, Thinking.

118
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,600
Uh, Actually,
They're Both Right.

119
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,700
Maybe The South Of France
Isn't Such A Good Idea.

120
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,600
I Am So Glad
To Hear You Say That.

121
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,100
'Cause At Piano Man's
Wine Tasting Last Night,

122
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,700
Everybody Was Saying That
Positano Is The New Monaco.

123
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,700
I Don't Want
To Run Anymore.

124
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,500
I'm Turning Myself In.

125
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,900
Whoa, Whoa,
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

126
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,700
That Ain't What
We've Been Talkin' About.

127
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,200
I Can't Leave My Children.

128
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,300
Bradford May Have Moved On,

129
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,700
But Daniel And Alexis
Still Need Me.

130
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,800
Need You?
You Gon' Be In Prison.

131
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,900
I need You.

132
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,700
Between The Two Of Us,
You The One More Likely

133
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,900
To Have A Rich Friend
With An Empty Villa.

134
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
Well, At Least If
I'm Behind Bars,

135
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,800
They Can Come Visit.

136
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,900
I'm Sorry, Yoga.

137
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,100
All Right.

138
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,700
If That's The Way
You Want To Play This,

139
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,500
I'm-A Start Packing.

140
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,400
We Don't Have
Anything To Pack.

141
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,900
No, But They Do.

142
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,900
It Was Just Stupid To Think
That We Could Avoid Each Other

143
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,600
When We Work
In The Same Building.

144
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,900
Now I Don't Know
What To Do.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,600
You See, The Problem Is You've
Got No One Else To Focus On.

146
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,800
Not Bad, Not Bad.
Turn. Thank You.

147
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,100
You Need To Date.

148
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,200
Da? No, I Am Not Ready
To Get Involved Again.

149
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,500
Who Said Anything
About Getting Involved?

150
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,800
All You Wanna Do
Is Have A Little Bit Of Fun.
Christina,

151
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,700
Ten Minutes
Before The Fun Happens.

152
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,600
Well, You Don't Know
What You're Missing, Do You?

153
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
Okay, Turn.

154
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
(Low Voice) Christina, What--
What Are You Doing?

155
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,600
You Can't Alter Underwear.

156
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,100
(Low Voice) Oh,
They Never Catch On.

157
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,300
(Normal Voice)
Okay, Executive Decision--

158
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,900
I'm Gonna Put Your Profile
On Bachelocity.Com.

159
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,800
(Normal Voice) Internet Dating?
There Are Freaks Online.

160
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,400
Why Don't You Just
Chop Me Into Pieces Yourself,

161
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,700
And We Can Cut Out
The Middleman?
Mm, They Don't Always

162
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,500
I Don't Need Internet Dating.
I Can Get Over Henry Myself.

163
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,900
I'm Not <I>That</I> Desperate.

164
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,400
(Man) You're
A Little Desperate.

165
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,300
The Internet It Is.

168
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,600
"Five Things
I Can't Live Without."

169
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Well, Doughnuts
And My Family...

170
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,200
Ugh, And Eyeglass Cleaner.

171
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,600
I Can't Stand It
When They Get Smudged.

172
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,100
Yeah, You Might Want To
Sex It Up Just A Little Bit.

173
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,400
Why? What Did You Put?
Well, Sex--Five Times.

174
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, Well, Maybe
I'll Come Back To This One.

175
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,600
Oh, Listen, Nobody Cares
About What You Write Anyway.

176
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,700
All They Care About
Is That You've Got

177
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,200
A Cute Little Photograph.
Now Smile.

178
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,000
Ooh.

179
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,700
Oh, No, I Wasn't Ready.
Do Another One.

180
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,500
Okay, Smile.

181
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,300
(Camera Shutter Clicks)
Oh, Well, That One's
A Little Bit Better.

182
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,500
At Least You've Got
One Eye Open.
Head Down, Shoot From Above,

183
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,400
Get Those Bangs To
Cover Those Caterpillars

184
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,600
And Hide Your Chins
By Doing This.

185
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,600
For God Sake,
Lose The Glasses.

186
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,200
Amanda, I Wear Glasses.
I'm Not Gonna Lie.

187
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,300
Whatever.

188
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,100
But Guys Don't Make Passes
At Girls Who Are Fat.

189
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,100
These Are The Shoes
I Borrowed.

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,300
You Borrowed The Jimmy Choos.
This Is A Sandwich.

191
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
You Usually Don't Open Up
The Box That Fast.

192
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,900
I'll Be Right Back.

193
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,100
Okay,
Let's Try This Again.

194
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,800
Aah, Ham!

195
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
Yeah!
That's Your Best One Yet.

196
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,600
Graphics Wants You
To Sign Off On This.
Brilliant.

197
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,900
But You Didn't Even
Look At It.

198
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,100
The First Rule In Ruining
A Magazine Is Stop Caring.

199
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,500
Uh, Why Don't You
Go Downstairs

200
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,900
And Supervise
The Valentino Shoot?
Me? Supervise A Shoot?

201
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,300
Whoa! You've Never Asked Me
To Supervise Anything Before.

202
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,100
Wait A Minute,
Is This Part Of Your Plan

203
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,200
To Make The Magazine Suck?
Do You Care? There'll Be
Male Models In Underwear.

204
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
Mm, Not If
I Have My Way.

205
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,500
Knock, Knock.

206
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,500
Your Late.
Take Off Your Clothes.

207
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Ha Ha, Easy Sailor.
Buy A Girl A Drink First.

208
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,400
Oh, I-I'm Sorry, I Thought
You Were The Underwear Model.

209
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,300
Oh, No, No, No, No, No.

210
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,400
I Am Supervising
This Shoot.
(Sizzles)

211
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
But It's Funny
That You Mention That

212
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Because I Did Take
A Modeling Class Once.

213
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,700
You Know, Thought About It,
Put It Away,

214
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,800
Could Always Go Back
And Get It.

215
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,400
Hmm, Hmm, Hmm, Hmm.
Ow.

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,200
What Are You Laughing At?

217
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,700
You, Uh, You Slapped
Your Own Ass Too Hard.

218
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,600
That's Funny.

219
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,800
Oh, Yeah, I Guess
That Is Funny. Ha Ha.

220
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,600
Cliff St. Paul.
Marc St. James.

221
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,800
Wow, We're Both Saints.
Is Yours Fake, Too?

222
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,000
No.
Mine, Either.

223
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,100
Are You Sure This
Doesn't Make Me Look Fat?

224
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,400
(Sighs) I'll Sign
For That Package.

225
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,800
Well, Please Let Him Be Dumb.
He Can't Have Everything.

226
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,500
Oh. (Laughs)
I Put 'Em On Backward.

227
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,100
Thank You.

228
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,600
I Can Help You.

229
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,200
Hello?

230
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,100
(All) Hello.

231
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,500
Oh, Hey, <I>Papi.</I>

232
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,700
These Are My New Friends
From The Cemetery--

233
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Mabel, Esther, And Lucille.
They Lost Their Husbands, Too.

234
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,400
Heart Attack.

235
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,800
Liver Failure.

236
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,600
Stroke On A Cruise.

237
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm Sorry.

238
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,300
You Don't Get
Your Money Back,

239
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,000
But They Don't
Tell You That.

240
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,500
Oh, We're Maki A Quilt
From Our Husbands' Shirts.

241
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,300
Our Dead Husbands.
Fun.

242
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,600
Okay, I Decided
 Go With This One.

243
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,400
I Was Gonna Use The One
That Says,

244
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,400
"Drink Till She's Cute,"
But I Buried Him In It.

245
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,400
(All) Aw.

246
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
(Cliff) I Think
The Last Shot's The One.

247
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,000
So This Whole Window Thing
You're Doing, It's Genius.

248
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,900
I Love It.
Totally Get The Concept.

249
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,400
You Have No Idea, Do You?
None Whatsoever.

250
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,900
(Laughs)
Uh, "Rear Window."

251
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,400
Hitchcock?
Never Saw It.

252
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,300
Really?
It--It's Amazing.

253
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,700
I-I-I Love Hitchcock.
What Aut "Psycho"?

254
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,400
Uh, Work For One.
Does That Count?

255
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,100
Hey, Did You Guys
See "Saw"?

256
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,300
No.

257
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,100
Wh--I Said "Seesaw."
(Laughs)

258
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,800
Wow.

259
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,800
(Gasps) I Know. Oh.

260
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,100
Okay, You Have To Go
With Me Tomorrow Night.

261
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,300
I'm Seeing "Psycho"
At The Film Forum.
Oh, That Sounds Like Fun.

262
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,200
Maybe We Could
Grab A Beer Before.

263
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,900
Uh, Sure, If By "Beer"
You Mean "Appletini."

264
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
Okay.

265
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,700
Gus, Rear Back
In The Window.

266
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,600
What Is It, Girl?
Someone Felldown Their Well?

267
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,700
Betty...
Internet Dating...

268
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,100
Must Mock.

269
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,800
(Gasps) Ooh, Bookmark It.
I Gotta Stick Around Here.

270
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,800
I'm Trying To Work Up
The Nerve

271
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,900
To Ask Out
"Hot Pants" Over There.

272
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,600
Oh, You're Asking <I>Him</I> Out? Maybe
I'll Stay Here And Mock You.

273
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,300
What? You Think
He's Out Of My League?

274
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,300
He's A Nine. I'm An Eight.
He's A Ten. You're A Six.

275
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,800
You're A Bitch.
I'm A Seven.

276
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,400
Now I Know This Is
Going To Hurt A Bit,

277
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,700
But For Starters, We Can
Save 8% By Printing On...

278
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Rice Paper.

279
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,100
Look At That.
That's Not Terrible, Huh?

280
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,700
I Can See You.
(Wilhelmina) Well, We Can
Just Say We're Going Green.

281
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,300
People Will Do Anything If They
Think They're Saving A Tree.

282
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,100
Which Brings Me To...
Soy Ink.

283
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,300
I've Heard That Stuff
Tends To Rub Off.

284
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,800
We Could Throw In
A Packet Of Wasabi,

285
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,400
And Then
We All Got Lunch.
This Is Crazy.

286
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,100
We're Ruining The Magazine,
And It's All My Fault.

287
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
No, It's Not. It's My Fault.

288
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,400
Alexis, I'm The One
Who Lost The Advertisers.

289
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,900
Now, Now,
Stop Blaming Yourselves.

290
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,800
It's Both Your Faults,

291
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,800
But Fortunately,
I'm Here To Help.

292
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,600
Now How Do You Feel
About Free Detergent Samples?

293
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,900
B-Licious.

294
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,100
Kenny.

295
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,800
Henry Needs
Daniel's Tag On This.

296
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,300
Okay. Oh, And Will You
Give Henry My Time Card?

297
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,800
I Can't Make It
To The Accounting Department.

298
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,600
Chicken.
Stay Out Of It.

299
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
So B.T. Dubs, You Really Did
A Number On My Boy Henry.

300
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
I Don't Even Think Porn
And Malt Liquor

301
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,300
Can Heal The Damage
That You Have Inflicted.

302
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,800
Kenny, You're From Greenwich.
Stop <I>Frontin'.</I>

303
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,300
South Side, Yo.

304
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
 <I>Chris-Tay,</I>
Oh, Lookin' Good.

305
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,600
Oh, Go Away, Kenny.

306
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,100
Listen, Why Don't You
Tell Your Girl To Throw My Man

307
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,000
A Betty Biscuit Before
He Leaves For <I>Tucson?</I>
Tucson.

308
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,300
It's Spelled "Tuc-Son."

309
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,900
It Should Be Pronounced
"Tuck-Son."

310
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,900
I Don't Understand
A Word That Man Says.

311
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,600
Christina, Look. I Already
Have Responses To My Profile.

312
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,700
15 Of Them. First One's
From Ilovetacos.

313
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,100
I Love Tacos.

314
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,700
Then Ilovechurros.

315
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
I Love Churros.

316
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,300
Ilovetortillas.

317
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,900
Amanda,
You're <I>Not</I> Funny.

318
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,100
(Laughs)
I'm A Little Funny.

319
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,700
Look, There's One--
Niceguy47.

320
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,100
Oh, It's A Real One.
Mm-Hmm.

321
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,400
"I'd Love
To Go Out With You.

322
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,300
"Your Profile Says
You Enjoy Bowling,

323
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,000
So If You Have
Some <I>Spare</I> Time..."

324
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,200
Oh.
Aw.

325
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,100
I Don't Get It.

326
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,400
"Yes, I Love Bowling."

327
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Send.

328
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,900
Send That Again.

329
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Why?
You Typed "Blowing."

330
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,800
What Else Could They Do?

331
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,800
We Weren't Due To Dock
In Puerto Vallarta

332
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,300
For Two More Days.

333
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,200
So They Put Him
In The Freezer,

334
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,300
Right Next
To The Beef Tenderloin.
(Mabel) Done.

335
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,100
One For
My Grandson's Birthday,

336
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,100
And Then One
For Christmas,

337
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,600
In Case I'm Dead.

338
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,800
I Always Wondered
How My <I>Abuela</I>

339
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,600
Got Such Crisp Bills
In The Cards She Sent.

340
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,800
(Laughs) So What
Are We Doing Tomorrow?

341
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,900
Tomorrow? Look At Her,
The Optimist.

342
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,800
We're Taking
The Senior Center Bus

343
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,300
To Rockaway Beach.

344
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,300
The Beach Is
A Good Place To Die.
No, Home Is Best.

345
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,700
I Always Thought The Mall
Would Be A Good Place To Die,

346
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,000
But I'm A Shopper.

347
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,700
You Know Where's
 <I>Not</I> A Good Place To Die?

348
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,100
A Cruise Ship.
They Take Your Money.

349
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,800
I'm Gonna Write
Another Letter.

350
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,600
Ooh, That Reminds Me, I Have
To Write To That Cereal Company.

351
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,200
I Counted.

352
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,400
There's Not Two Scoops
Of Raisins In There.

353
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm Writing
The Networks.

354
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,200
Why Won't They Bring Back
That "Highway To Heaven"?

355
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,500
(Hilda) I Wish I Had
Someone To Write A Letter To.

356
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,400
Maybe I'll Find Something
To Hate In Rockaway.

357
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,300
(Mabel) You Coming, Too?

358
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,500
Yeah, Sure. What Else
I Got Goin' On?

359
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,300
Come On, Betty.

360
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,600
Your Opinion
Really Matters To Me.

361
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Ll, The New One
Doesn't Really Say

362
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,800
"Classy Fashion Magazine."

363
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,300
It's More
"Where's Lindsay's Mug Shot?"

364
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,900
Oh, And There It Is.

365
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,000
Daniel, Wouldn't You Rather
Just Keep "Mode" The Way It Is

366
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,300
And Go To Your Father
And Ask Him For Money?

367
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,600
Yeah, But You've Met
My Family.

368
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,100
My Mother Was Arrested
For Murder,

369
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,700
And She's The Nice One.

370
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Yeah, But Do You Really Want
"Mode" Going Out Like <I>This?</I>

371
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,600
Oh, Free Laundry Detergent.

372
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,700
Yeah, Knock Yourself Out.

373
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Thanks.

374
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Why Are You Wearing
Your Lucky Sweater?

375
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,500
It's Not Taco Tuesday.

376
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,500
No, But I Have
An Appointment...

377
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,700
At The Bowling Alley...
With A Boy.

378
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,800
That's A Date.
Betty, You've Got A Date.

379
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm So Proud Of You
For Getting Back Out There.

380
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,500
Me, Too.

381
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,900
whore!(Speaking Spanish)

382
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,800
you plotted with Lorenzo to steal my heart...

383
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,199
and then steal my husband!

384
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,900
Would You And The Golden Girls
Like A Snack?

385
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,699
I've Got Some Soft Food.

386
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,100
It's Almost Dinnertime.

387
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,600
It's 3:15.

388
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,700
(Gasps)
We're Gonna Be Late.

389
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,100
It's The Early Bird Special.

390
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,500
Ack! Mabel Left
Her Teeth Again. Ew.

391
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,699
She's Gonna Need These
If She Wants The Roast Beef.

392
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,000
Hold It. You Just
Put Teeth In Your Purse.

393
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,799
What's Going On With You
And These Old Ladies?

394
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,699
They're Fun.
Oh Yeah, "Stroke-On-A-Cruise"
 A Laugh Riot.

395
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,199
They Get Me.
Ever Since Santos Died,

396
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,100
Everyone Says, "I Know What
You're Going Through."

397
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,600
Well, They Don't.

398
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,099
They Don't Know What It's Like
To Wake Up Every Morning,

399
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,600
Roll Over And Not See
That Person Next To You.

400
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,700
These Women Do.
Yeah, Well,
I Do, Too, Hilda.

401
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,600
Since I Lost Your Mother,
Not A Day Goes By

402
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,700
That I Don't Miss Her.
I Know.

403
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,200
But It Can't Mean
That Life Stops.

404
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,700
You Still Have A Future
Ahead Of You.

405
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,100
And You've Got A Son
That Needs You.

406
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,800
Justin Is Fine.
I'm Fine.

407
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,800
Well, Except For
This Shooting Pain In Myack.

408
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,600
Feels Like Rain.

409
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,400
All Right, Girls.
(Claps Hands) Let's Go.

410
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,100
Look.

411
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,300
This Is Soy Ink.

412
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,100
This Is Dolce.

413
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,399
Damn It. I've Gotta
Stop Doing That.

414
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,199
Okay, So Maybe Soy Ink
Isn't The Best Option.

415
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,300
We'll Figure
Something Else Out.

416
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,600
We're Out Of Options.
You Know What We Have To Do.

417
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,800
Oh, No. No.
I'm Not Going To Dad.

418
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,399
He's Finally Staing
To Trust Me.

419
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,899
H-How Can I Tell Him
I Lost Half Our Advertisers?

420
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,899
You Can't, But I Can.

421
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,500
I May Not Remember
The Last Couple Years,

422
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,999
But I Know I Was
His Golden Boy.

423
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,699
I'll Just Tell Him
It Was My Fault,

424
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,200
And I'll Get The Money
From Him.
All Right.

425
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,199
You Were Always The One Who
Could Get Away With Anything.

426
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,499
I'll Be Right Back.

427
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
This Golden Boy's Gotta Go
Wash Ink Off His Boobs.

428
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,500
G-Stick,
You Sittin' Down?

429
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,100
Um, Ye
You Can See I Am.

430
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Brace Yourself. Bad News
Vis-?Vis Your Old Lady.

431
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,000
Oh, My God, My Mom?
Did She Fall Again?

432
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,600
Nah, I'm Talkin'
About Betty.

433
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,300
Oh, My God,
Did Betty Fall Again?
Worse.

434
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,600
You Know I'm Hooked Up Like
Perez When It Comes To Gossip.

435
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,700
I Hear Everything, Yo.

436
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,600
That's Because You Pee
In The Ladies' Room.

437
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,300
Well, They're Cleaner.
Men Are Pigs.

438
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,700
But This Is Something
I Heard With My Own Eyes.

439
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,900
Kenny, Will You Just Tell Me?
What's Going On With Betty?

440
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,200
Bowling...

441
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,600
Tonight...

442
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,400
With A Dude.

443
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,500
Cuteinqueens?

444
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
(Gasps) Niceguy47?

445
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,000
Hi, I'm Betty.

446
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,099
Steve.

447
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,299
It's Nice To Meet You.

448
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,499
Adult Braces. Wow.

449
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,900
Oh, Yeah. Uh, You Probably
Didn't See Them In The Photo.

450
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,200
I'm Glad
You Recognized Me.

451
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,700
Um, Size 6, Please.

452
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,100
An 11.

453
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,100
Yeah, That Was
A Really Good Picture.

454
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,400
I Know, It Was, Like,
My Best Ever.

455
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,800

456
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,600

461
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,500
I mean??? 

462
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,050
So I Fured,Why Even Bother With Ilovebunnies?

463
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,050
Yeah,Why Bother? Lot Of Frames Left.

464
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,340
Oh,You're Right. You're Right.

465
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,050
But Just So You Know,That's How I Ended Up With Cuteinqueens.

466
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,660
I Didn't Want You Thinking I Was Conceited,

467
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,840
'Cause I'm Not.

468
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,730
Oh,That's Me.

469
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,700
Uh,Go Ahead. I'm Gonna Hit The Restroom.

470
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,120
Oh,Okay,Uh,Funny Story About The Bathroom Here--

471
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,660
A Little Gross, But Mostly Funny.

472
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,670
I'll Tell You When You Get Back.

473
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:22,950
Hello.

474
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,080
So How's It Going?

475
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,050
Good. He's A Really Nice Guy, Just Like His Screen Name Says.

476
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,030
And We Haven't Had Any Of Those Awkward Pauses.

477
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,640
Great. (Computer Beeps)

478
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,720
Oh,I Have To Go.

479
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,180
Someone's I.M.Ing Me On Bachelocity.

480
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,830
Maybe I'll Get As Lucky As You Did. See You Later.

481
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,340
You're not slngle.

482
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:49,730
"And You Are A Creepy Stalker."

483
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,309
No I'm not. I'm your husband.

484
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,350
Look What I Swiped From The Closet

485
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,310
For My Date With The Underwear Model.

486
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,730
That's Right. I'm Seeing Gus Tonight. I Don't Believe You.

487
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:32,660
It's True.

488
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,160
I Want Proof. Ooh,Send Me A Dirty Cell Phone Picture.

489
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,500
Oh,But Not Your Parts Again. That Was Gross.

490
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,510
Yeah,Well, Your Left One's Bigger.

491
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,920
Hey.

492
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,920
You Got All Dressed Up.

493
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,640
Mm. (Singsongy) New Cashmere.

494
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,402
Old... Cat Hair.

495
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,830
So Listen,After The Movie, Maybe We Can Go To The Village--

496
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,850
Oh,Yeah,Right. Oh,I Meant To Call You.

497
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,070
I'm Gonna Have To Take A Rain Check On "Psycho."

498
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,220
You're Not Going To Believe This,

499
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,310
But I Asked Out Gus.

500
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,170
For... Tonight? Yeah, And He Said,"Yes."

501
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,350
Aah! (Singsongy) I'm Going Out With An Underwear Model.

502
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,730
(Normal Voice) Are You Dying? I'm Dying.

503
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,000
Oh,Yeah,Yeah,I'm Dying. Uh,I Thought We Were Going Out.

504
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,620
Yeah,But Gus And I Are Going On A <I>Date.</I>

505
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,800
You And I Were Just Gonna...

506
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,240
Oh.

507
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,750
No. No "Oh." It-It-It's Fine.

508
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,490
We Weren't... At All. Cliff...

509
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,373
Okay,I've Gotta Go. Have Fun On Your Date.

510
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,540
* You Can't Have Me

511
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,220
* You Can't Keep Me For Yourse *

512
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,290
* Not You...

513
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,070
Yes,I Got One!

514
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,130
Henry?

515
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:04,490
Oh,My God,Betty. I Didn't See You.

516
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,010
What Are You Doing Here?

517
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,680
League Night.

518
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,160
The Accountants Have A Team-- "The Debitz" With A "Z."

519
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,850
Totally Intimidates "The Actuaries."

520
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,270
What About You?

521
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,810
Oh,Um,I'm On A Date.

522
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,830
A First Date. It's Going Really Well.

523
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,790
Actually, He'll Be Back Any Second.

524
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,220
He--He Doesn't--He Didn't Have A-A Yellow Shirt On,Did He?

525
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,610
Yeah,Yeah

526
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,730
I-I've Been Calling Him "Yellow Head" All Night.

527
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:35,690
We Just Laugh. Uh,How Did You Know?

528
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,590
Well,I-I Think I Saw Him In The Bathroom,

529
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,130
And He--He Got A Phone Call And Had To Leave.

530
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,460
Oh,My God. Well,Do You Know Why?

531
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:49,810
Well,I Think I Heard Him Say Something About A Pet Bird.

532
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,870
It Was Sick. Bird Flu.

533
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,870
Yeah,He Had To Rush And Say Good-Bye,

534
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,160
And He--He Taught The Bird How To Say Good-Bye,

535
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,350
And--You Know What? The Bird's Sick.

536
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,620
Let's Just Leave It At That.

537
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,390
Oh,Uh,Well, That's Too Bad.

538
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,490
Um,Well,I Guess I'll Just Finish My Game On My Own.

539
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,220
It Was Good To See You.

540
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,130
Hey,You Know What?

541
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
Um,I Was Thinking...

542
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,980
Well,I Don't See Any Of The Other Debitz Here.

543
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,610
Do You Mind If I Just Warmed Up In The Lane Next To You?

544
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,890
Aren't We Supposed To Be Avoiding Each Other?

545
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,740
Right. How's That Working For You?

546
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,780
Not So Good. Same Here.

547
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,840
Look,Why Don't We Just Try And Be Friends?

548
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,640
Yeah. And In That Case, Friends Bowl,Right?

549
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,220
Right.

550
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,260
Yeah.

551
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,740
I've Been Doing That All Night.

552
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,240
Nice. (Laughs) (Laughs)

553
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,860
<I>(Man) Okay,Lovers,</I>

554
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,710
<I>It's The Time</I>  <I>You've All Been Waiting For.</I>

555
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,018
<I>It's Couples' Bowl.</I>

556
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,850
<I>(Woman) * Yeah,Yeah,Yeah </I>

557
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,860
Bowling Sucks.

558
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,470
Let's Go.

559
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,280
Cliff,I Am So Sorry.

560
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,670
Look,It's-- It's Not A Big Deal.

561
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,980
It's Just-- Just A Misunderstanding.

562
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,580
We--We Never Need To Talk About This Again.

563
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,430
You Know What? We Are Gonna Talk About This Again.

564
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,160
I Don't Know What Planet You're From,

565
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,400
But When Someone Asks You Out For Drinks And A Movie,

566
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,230
That's A Date, And The Only Reason

567
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,830
You Didn't Think So Is 'Cause It Was Me.

568
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,720
That's Not True. Oh,Come On.

569
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,370
We Both Know That I Don't Have "Muscle Tone"

570
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:42,590
Or--Or Use "Products," And For No Apparent Reason,

571
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,110
I Now Do  Annoying "Air Quotes."

572
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,290
Stop It.

573
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,130
You're Such A Clich?

574
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,530
You And Gus? What Is That?

575
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,640
That's Beauty... And Beauty. That's Not A Story.

576
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,950
Now "Beauty And The Beast"-- That's A Fairy Tale.

577
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,050
I Am Not Dating Gus Just Because Of His Looks.

578
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,600
We Had A Real Connection. We Laughed Together.

579
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,980
<I>We</I> Laughed Together. Gus Just Stood There

580
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,390
In His Backwards Underwear Lookin' Hot.

581
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,200
So You Admit That He's Hot.

582
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:10,380
Yes. Yes,He Is Hot. But I've Got News For You.

583
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,050
In 20 Years,That Guy Candy Is Gonna Turn Into This.

584
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,350
I Just Got There A Little Sooner.

585
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,090
You Know Something,Marc?

586
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,870
I Thought That There Was More To You.

587
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,800
It's My Mistake.

588
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,580
Alexis,Daniel.

589
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,880
Dad.

590
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,870
And This Is My FiancE, Wilhelmina.

591
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,340
I've Heard So Much About You.

592
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,880
(Laughs) So When's The Last Time I Was Here?

593
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,720
Oh,About A Month Ago, Before The Car Accident.

594
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,080
We Had Dinner Together, As We Do Every Sunday.

595
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,630
(Low Voice) Laying It On A Little Thick,Aren't We?

596
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,910
May I Take Your Coat? Sure.

597
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,130
You Okay?

598
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,850
Yeah,Uh...

599
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,420
I Thought I Just Had,Like, A Memory Flashback Or Something.

600
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,750
Weird. Maybe I'm Just Hungry.

601
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,970
Well,You're In Luck.

602
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,310
Mommy Made Fondue.

603
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,960
Now Everyone Put Your Hats On.

604
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,590
I Am Not Putting That On.

605
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,760
Bah Humbug,Daniel. We're All Together Tonight.

606
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,500
It's A Perfect Time To Take Our Holiday Photo.

607
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:43,500
Actually,We Usually Do It In Front Of The Christmas Tree

608
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,800
With Our Real Mother. Come On.

609
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,970
Daniel,I Would Never Try

610
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,840
To Take The Place Of Your Real Mother.

611
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,800
You'll Have Two Christmases This Year--One Here

612
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,600
And One On The Lam. Here,Let Me Take That For You.

613
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,600
Unless You Want To Continue In Your Mother's Tradition.

614
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,990
Thanks,Dad.

615
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,040
All Right, Everyone Smile.

616
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,730
(Yoga Whispering) Hey,Fish.

617
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,480
What The Hell Do You Think You're Doing?

618
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,530
I Don't... I-I Don't Know.

619
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:26,250
I-I Saw The Gun And... And The Wedding Invitation,

620
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,130
And I Just Lost It.

621
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,390
But Look.

622
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,900
The Woman That Ruined My Life Did What I Never Could.

623
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,070
She Brought Them Together.

624
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,000
They're A Family.

625
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,020
That's All I Ever Wanted.

626
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,330
It's Okay Now.

627
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,370
Let's Go To Italy.

628
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,790
(Hilda) I Gotta Say, This Is Very Relaxing.

629
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,950
It Really Does Pass The Time.

630
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
You Know What Else Was Nice?

631
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,350
The Applesauce That We Had For Dinner.

632
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,810
I Think I Could Have It Every Day. (Laughs)

633
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,080
They're Sleeping, Grandma.

634
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,150
For Her,It Could Be The Big One.

635
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,890
<I>Ay,Papi.</I>

636
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,320
It's Not Much, But It's There. (Siren Whoops)

637
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,110
Who Died? I Get Her Clothes.

638
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,450
I'll Get It.

639
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,110
Justin.

640
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,660
Hey,Hilda. Listen,Justin Took Your Car

641
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,990
For A Little Joyride With His Friends.

642
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,640
What?

643
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,600
I'm Goin' Upstairs.

644
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,050
Hey. He Crashed It Into A Tree.

645
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,470
No One Was Hurt

646
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,760
Except The Car And The Tree.

647
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,870
Listen,This One's Between Us.

648
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,160
I Know You Been Goin' Through A Lot Lately,

649
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,600
But Keep An Eye On Him.

650
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,610
I Seen These Things Spiral.

651
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,650
Yeah,Yeah. Thanks,Rita.

652
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,040
Mm-Hmm.

653
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,360
Thanks.

654
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,210
All Right,Ladies.

655
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,350
Looks Like We're Gonna Have To Wrap Things Up.

656
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,860
You Don't Have To Go Home, But You Can't Quilt Here.

657
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,130
Will We See You Tomorrow?

658
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,830
I Don't Think So. I Mean,This Was Fun,

659
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,880
But Maybe I'll Just See You At The Cemetery.

660
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,460
I Mean,Above Ground. (Women Laugh)

661
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,310
So Who's Got The Walker? Yeah,Let's Help.

662
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,520
Well,Dinner Is Served.

663
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,630
Come On.

664
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,640
Soup's Not Soup Unless It's Hot.

665
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,900
Wait,Dad,There's Something I Have To Tell You.

666
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,950
It's About The Magazine.

667
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,610
No,Alexis. I Can't Let You Do That.

668
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,950
Hot Or Cold, Soup Is Soup.

669
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,590
I Lost Atlantic Attire,

670
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,860
Which Led To A Substantial Advertiser Pullout.

671
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,420
How Substantial?

672
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,970
52%, But I Can Explain.

673
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,800
Of All The Incompetent-- Hold On,Dad. It's Not His Fault.

674
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,460
He Was Protecting Me. Don't Defend Him.

675
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,670
Your Brother Has A Long History Of Making Mistakes Around Here

676
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,440
And Expecting Everybody Else To Clean Up After Him.

677
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,000
You're The Only One I Can Count On To Do Anything Right.

678
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,540
And Me,Of Course.

679
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,520
Look,I Can Fix This. Just Give Me The Chance.

680
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,220
(Bradford,Voice Distorted) I Always Knew

681
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,310
Something Like This Wagonna Happen.

682
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,550
You've Had Every Opportunity Handed To You.

683
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,860
How The Hell Could You Turn Into Such A Screwup?

684
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,750
<I>You Are Dead To Me,Alex.</I>

685
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,850
Excuse Me.

686
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,490
Oh,Boy,It Really Is Date Night.

687
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,880
Who Cares?

688
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,340
Two Friends Can Have Dinner,Right?

689
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,360
No Big Deal.

690
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,680
Yeah.

691
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,870
What Are You Doing?

692
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,620
Oh,Oh, This Is For Me.

693
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,640
Sucks To Be You.

694
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,480
No,Seriously, Do You Want To Sit Here?

695
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,040
No,I'm Fine.

696
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,780
Thank You.

697
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,800
Thank You.

698
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,110
Oh,Look, It's My Date's Bird.

699
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,260
Guess He Didn't Make It.

700
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,610
I'm Sorry. I'm A Terrible Liar.

701
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,520
????

702
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,710
And You're On A Bowling Team Called The Debitz?

703
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:39,610
No,The Debitz Are Real. It Just Wasn't League Night. Oh.

704
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:44,010
I-I Heard You Were On A Date, And It Made Me Kind Of Crazy.

705
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,990
Are You Serious? You Got Jealous?

706
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,550
Oh,No,No,No. We Are Not...

707
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,270
We're Friends. He Got Another Girl Pregnant.

708
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:56,070
Betty. What? I Can Deal With It. I'm Sure Hcan.

709
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,150
Rose For Your Pretty Lady?

710
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,350
Oh,No,She's Not My Pretty Lady.

711
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,360
I Mean,She's Pretty, Uh,But...

712
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,710
He Got Another Girl Pregnant. Oh.

713
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,910
Oh.

714
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,110
You Know What? Suddenly I'm Not So Hungry.

715
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,900
Wait,Betty,Wait.

716
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,020
No,We Can Do This. You Mean So Much To Me.

717
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,470
Oh,My God, He's Proposing!

718
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,510
What? What? No,No.

719
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,880
(Man) Champagne For The Happy Couple. No,No. No,No,I'm Not.

720
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,830
Wait. I Would,But...

721
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,450
I Can't Do This.

722
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,110
No,Uh...

723
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,480
You Okay?

724
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,140
Where Are Ey?

725
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,740
Down In The Kitchen.

726
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,750
She's Licking Fondue Cheese Off His Fingers.

727
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,230
What's Wrong?

728
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,210
I Remember Everything.

729
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,990
Dad's Been Lying To Me This Whole Time,

730
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,180
Acting Like Some Loving Father.

731
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,210
He Hates Me.

732
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,970
No,He Doesn't. He Just Wanted To Use The Accident

733
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,050
As A Way To Start Over With You.

734
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,960
I Remember The Accident,Too. It Wasn't Your Fault.

735
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,480
What?

736
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,670
We Took Dad's Car, And I Had...

737
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,820
I'd--I'd Paid Someone To,Um...

738
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,320
To Cut The Brakes.

739
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,820
What? No,You Didn't.

740
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,560
Yes,I Did.

741
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,150
He Was Trying To Get Rid Of Me, And So I Was Trying To...

742
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,290
What? Kill Him?

743
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,810
Oh,God. Alexis,What The Hell Is Wrong With You?

744
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,450
I Was Torturing Myself. I Thought <I>I</I> Put You In A Coma.

745
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,110
All This Time You Wanted To Murder Our Father?

746
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,950
Daniel,I'm Sorry.

747
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,760
Please Don't Tell Him.

748
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,410
Wouldn't Believe Me Anyway.

749
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,680
So You Had A Big Day,Huh?

750
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,800
Stealing A Car, Crashing A Car.

751
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,530
I Think We Should Talk About It.

752
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,140
Are You Serious?

753
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,340
Yeah,I Know You Think I Haven't Been Paying Attention

754
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,410
To What's Been Going On Lately,

755
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,830
And Maybe I Haven't, But That's Gonna Change.

756
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,900
Oh,So Now You're Gonna Turn Back Into A Mother?

757
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,750
What's That Supposed To Mean?

758
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,680
It's Not Exactly A Part-Time Job When You Feel Like It.

759
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,290
Oh,No, Get The Hell Back Here.

760
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,880
I <I>Am</I> Your Mother. Don't You Forget It.

761
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,710
Let Go Of Me. No,Justin,Listen.

762
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,840
A Kid Losing His Father--

763
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:41,440
That Is Not Supposed To Happen.

764
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,240
And I Would Do Anything-- Anything In The World

765
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,080
If I Could Bring Him Back.

766
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,300
But... It's Just You And Me.

767
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,250
We're All We've Got.

768
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,690
And I'm Getting Scared, Justin,

769
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:04,810
Because I Feel Like We're-- We're Moving Like This.

770
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:12,850
So I Think It's Time We Pull It Together,Yeah?

771
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,430
I Mean,I Been Acting Like An 80 Year Old,

772
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:17,250
And You With The... With The Attitude

773
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,610
And The Clothes--

774
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,730
That's Not You.

775
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,230
I Just Wanted Him To Be Proud Of Me.

776
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,230
Oh,Baby,He Was Proud Of You.

777
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,610
He <I>Is.</I>

778
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:33,420
Just Exactly, Exactly Like You Are.

779
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,070
I Just Miss Him So Much.

780
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,470
Oh,Me,Too.

781
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,460
But It's Gonna Be Okay.

782
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,420
Just Let It Out.

783
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,210
We're Gonna Be Okay.

784
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,670
Oh.

785
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,310
If You Had Told Me When I Woke Up This Morning,

786
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,410
That I Would End Up At Your Apartment,

787
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,990
I Woulnot Have Believed You.

788
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,860
Will You Stop Grinning?

789
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,100
You Picked Me.

790
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,680
I Didn't Pick You. I Just Wanted To See "Psycho."

791
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,690
* You Picked Me Over An Underwear Model *

792
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,020
What Is That?

793
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,650
That--That Is A Dance You're Never Gonna See Again.

794
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,460
Exactly.

795
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,850
So What If I Get Scared?

796
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,460
Well...

797
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,290
Then I'll Be Right Here Next To You.

798
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,070
What? (Henry) I Need To Talk To You.

799
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,870
Why? What Could There Possibly Be Left To Say?

800
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,260
I Just Don't Want Things To End Like This.

801
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,630
So You Had To Follow Me All The Way Home?

802
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,070
No,I Followed You Because I Didn't Want You

803
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,670
Walking Alone At Night.

804
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,890
Henry,Please.

805
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,650
Stop. Stop Being So Nice.

806
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,600
You're Not Making This Any Easier.

807
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,130
Well,What Am I Supposed To Do?

808
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,850
I Don't Know.

809
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,410
Kick A Puppy Or Knock Over A Midget.

810
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,310
I-I Think The More Considerate Term

811
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,390
Is "Little Person"?

812
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,070
No. See? This Is Exactly What I'm Talking About.

813
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,810
Well,I Don't Know What To Do.

814
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,040
We Said We Were Gonna Avoid Each Other

815
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,070
And That Didn't Work.

816
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,060
Being Friends Practically Got Us Married.

817
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,200
So What's Left? Should I Leave "Mode"?

818
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,680
Okay.

819
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,380
I'll--I'll Give My Notice On Monday.

820
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,250
Daniel Can Help You Find Something.

821
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,650
Yeah.

822
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,670
Good-Bye,Henry.

823
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,450
Good-Bye,Betty.

824
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,520
There Is Another Option.

825
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,280
There Is?

826
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:40,580
(Man) * You Must Remember This

827
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,690
I Know You're Leaving In Five Months,

828
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,330
And I Know Everyone's Gonna Say It's A Big Mistake,

829
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:50,500
And I Know That I'm Gonna Get My Heart Broken,

830
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,660
But Maybe It's Worth It.

831
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,110
Are You Sure?

832
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,680
* It's Still The Same Old Story *

833
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,110
* A Fight For Love And Glory *

834
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:07,360
