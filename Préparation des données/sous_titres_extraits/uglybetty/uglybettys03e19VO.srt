1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,050
Ok I need to say something

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,333
And this is really hard

3
00:00:06,176 --> 00:00:07,640
You know in situations like these

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,817
It's best to just take a deep breath and say it

5
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:17,002
Grimaldi's pizza's slightly superior than Lombardi's, you win

6
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:20,223
Never challenge me when it comes to pizza cause you will always lose

7
00:00:20,614 --> 00:00:22,131
My dollar please

8
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:27,362
What's this?

9
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:28,893
Open it and see

10
00:00:32,392 --> 00:00:33,326
It's a hair put

11
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:35,077
Matt ..

12
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,547
Saw it and I thought of you, Bee for Betty

13
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:39,683
The stones aren't real or anything

14
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:41,585
I mean they're real, they're just not .. You know ..

15
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:43,587
It's beautiful, I love it

16
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:47,106
I wanted to get you something in honor of our monthiversary

17
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:48,702
Has it been a month already?

18
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,495
You know, you don't always have to bring me back to Queens

19
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:53,603
Well that's where my queen lives

20
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:56,510
Dad!

22
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:00,736
I'm so sorry

23
00:01:00,782 --> 00:01:03,928
I didn't realize you two were out here

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,427
Hi Matt

25
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:06,571
Hello Mr. Suarez

26
00:01:06,865 --> 00:01:10,504
I was on my to the Bianco's see if I could borrow their cooler to go on this trip

27
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,018
I made them sugar cookies

28
00:01:12,018 --> 00:01:12,739
On what trip?

29
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,503
My dad is taking Justin to a cabin in the Poconos with Elena and her nephews

30
00:01:16,503 --> 00:01:17,697
Oh that should be cool

31
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:19,041
Yeah cool

32
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:25,244
Oh ok, I'll see you kids later

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,539
- Sorry 
- That's okay

34
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:33,658
You don't have to walk me all the way in

35
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:36,705
What can I say .. I'm a nice guy

36
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:38,689
Hey I had fun tonight

37
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:39,924
Oh me too

38
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:46,585
Thank you, thanks for dinner!

39
00:01:46,832 --> 00:01:48,437
It was delicious

40
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,512
Papi!

41
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,202
Oh no! I'm so sorry

42
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,221
It's okay, I have a hard head

43
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:58,300
How are you doing Mr. Suarez?

44
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,820
Good, good, how are you councilman?

45
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,724
I'm good

46
00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:03,520
Good .. Good!

47
00:02:04,762 --> 00:02:06,122
Well I guess I should be getting home

48
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:07,011
I'll see you tomorrow

49
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:08,495
Oh ok, oh ok

50
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,088
Goodnight

51
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:10,000
Bye

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,830
Bye! For now

53
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:16,408
So another date huh?

54
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:18,203
Things are going good between you guys

55
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:19,674
I guess

56
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:21,406
Hilda, how was your date?

57
00:02:22,103 --> 00:02:24,525
You guess? Why aren't you more enthusiastic?

58
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:26,309
Archie is a great guy

59
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:28,529
I know papi okay?

60
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:32,978
I like him, I'm just not sure if I LIKE him yet

61
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:37,260
Hilda, that's like saying you're not sure you like Sirloin steak, it's crazy

62
00:02:37,953 --> 00:02:41,768
Mum, Do I really have to go camping with grandpa and Elena?

63
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:44,536
Yes! Elena's nephews are dying to meet you

64
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:46,474
And they planned the whole thing with you and Mike

65
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:48,637
They planned it with me and Mike to be at a spa

66
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:51,311
With mud baths and ginger facials

67
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:52,237
You're going

68
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:54,926
There'll be plenty of mud

69
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:24,570
Connor?

70
00:03:31,073 --> 00:03:32,988
Connor?

71
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:53,673
Okay guys, with Mode's first ever sex issue on the stand in just 3 days

72
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:55,328
It might seem like the hard work's over

73
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:56,283
But it's not

74
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:59,351
In order to get new advertisers and keep the old ones

75
00:03:59,842 --> 00:04:01,702
We have to make sure our overnight numbers kill

76
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:05,468
That means using every resource we can to get people talking

77
00:04:05,468 --> 00:04:06,722
You know, fire them up

78
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:09,327
Oh Daniel, we could do a tying with modernway.com

79
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:10,053
Bring it!

80
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:11,952
Great! See, that's an awesome idea

81
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,485
I think you people know how important this issue is

82
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:26,609
Pardon me, I had a late night

83
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,418
Here's some more coffee for you

84
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,567
You all know what to do, let's get to it

85
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,501
Ok, you are going to laugh

86
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:41,188
I just got off the phone with the Olsen's twins

87
00:04:41,188 --> 00:04:45,084
Apparently they feel just awful that they didn't include you

88
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:48,299
In their big "influence" cokie table book

89
00:04:48,299 --> 00:04:52,221
So they would love it, if you would be a part of their next book

90
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,681
"More influence"

91
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:56,382
Willy

92
00:05:01,345 --> 00:05:03,076
Willy?

93
00:05:06,377 --> 00:05:12,359
Oh my god, oh my god! She's dead, She's dead!

94
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:16,242
Stop your shrieking Marc, I was just taking a nap

95
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:20,147
But your eyes were ..

96
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:21,601
I haven't slept in weeks

97
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:27,976
I just wake all night, feeling so tense

98
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:31,816
Well naturally, look at your desk, it's a mess

99
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:38,892
Maybe something else is on your mind?

100
00:05:38,892 --> 00:05:41,701
Yes getting a good night sleep is on my mind

101
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:45,528
I can't even take a sleeping pill because of that damn baby

102
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,595
Marc, I need help

103
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,256
Of course you do

104
00:05:52,774 --> 00:05:55,151
And I am here for you

105
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,266
What the hell do you think you're doing?

106
00:05:58,656 --> 00:06:00,760
I meant I needed you to hire a night nanny

107
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,339
Oh ok, well I'll get right on it

108
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,023
But Willy

109
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:13,366
Aren't there maybe some other night needs, that aren't being met?

110
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:18,164
Willy, Willy?

111
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,846
Agh, this is so weird

112
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:25,302
Hey Betty, I've got a web thing

113
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:29,053
What do you think about "fun sex versus boring relationship sex"?

114
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:32,063
You can write about all the boring things you do with what's his name

115
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:33,001
- Matt 
- Whatever

116
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:35,688
And I can write about all the fun things I'm gonna do

117
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:36,964
With whatever guy I meet tonight

118
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:40,352
How about the modern-day mating rituals

119
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:42,397
You know something a little less personal

120
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:44,337
Ooh you slut! Why? What are you hiding?

121
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:45,857
Matt's into kink isn't he?

122
00:06:45,857 --> 00:06:48,066
Is he your loving pig? Does he like ice cubing?

123
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:49,298
- Ice what? 
- Cubing

124
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:51,955
No, Matt is into normal things I think

125
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:57,740
Oh my god, are you actually saying that you haven't tapped that yet?

126
00:06:58,648 --> 00:07:01,635
No, but we're definitely headed in that direction

127
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:02,855
We just haven't got there yet

128
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:03,966
This is none of your business

129
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,306
But Betty you have been dating for like a year

130
00:07:06,306 --> 00:07:07,494
- A month
- Exactly

131
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:11,310
And he's a billionaire and for some reason he seems to be into you

132
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,121
What the hell are you waiting for?

133
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:26,204
Betty are you wearing the La Fleur?

134
00:07:26,204 --> 00:07:27,155
Maybe ..

135
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,993
Ooh what's the special occasion?

136
00:07:28,993 --> 00:07:33,881
Matt and I have a date and I was kinda hoping tonight will be the night

137
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:36,693
Hoping? if you're ready just tell him

138
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:39,935
Well it's not that easy, I mean I've never had to do that before

139
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:41,851
With Henry and Walter it just kinda happened

140
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:45,951
Oh yeah, well some guys need more of a push

141
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:47,571
Let me see your bra

142
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:48,878
What?!

143
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:55,081
Aye, papi jeez, you're going camping for two days not two weeks

144
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:57,599
I know! He can bring six cans of bug sprays

145
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,206
But I can't bring a blow dryer

146
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:00,786
There's no electricity

147
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:02,191
Oh dear god!

148
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:04,637
Hey we hit the road at 5am

149
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:06,169
You girls up for an early breakfast?

150
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,477
Well I know I'll be there

151
00:08:07,477 --> 00:08:09,785
I have a date with Archie so I should be in bed by 9

152
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:11,771
Haha good! How about you Betty?

153
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:17,003
Actually, I ..  Matt and I are gonna have a late dinner

154
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,951
That's alright, I'll just come in and give you a little kiss before we leave

155
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:25,236
Papi, I think that I'm gonna stay in the city tonight

156
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,753
You know, get some work on my web article done

157
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:30,848
How can you stay in the city, you don't have a place there anymore

158
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:34,012
Jeez, papi, she's spending the night with her boyfriend

159
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:36,240
Even I knew that, she's wearing lip gloss!

160
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:45,149
Okay, I'll just see you when I see you, bye

161
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,336
- Have fun! 
-Bye!

162
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:57,924
Hey Daniel, can I ask you something?

163
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:02,197
What do you think of me doing a poetry slam?

164
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:06,687
Oh you're serious

165
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:08,769
Yeah I've been writing poetry for years

166
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:10,543
And I never had enough to perform any of it

167
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:12,246
And it's something I've always wanted to do

168
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:14,676
Then you should definitely do that

169
00:09:14,676 --> 00:09:15,988
You don't think it sounds crazy?

170
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,282
I didn't say that

171
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:18,641
Hey!

172
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:21,796
Well seriously I think that's brave

173
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:24,245
You couldn't pay me enough to get up in front of people and perform

174
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:24,955
Why?

175
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:28,686
Just a horrible scarring, High school rock band experience

176
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:31,260
Oh my god! You were in a band? What did you play?

177
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,786
Guitar, sort of, I thought I was really good, I was really bad!

178
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:37,904
What happened?

179
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:43,941
Umm I had to write this incredibly cheesy song "Crash and Burn" it was called

180
00:09:43,941 --> 00:09:45,833
For the battle of the bands at school

181
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,476
I was laughed off the stage

182
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:51,197
You would've laughed too though, especially if you'd seen my hair

183
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:53,826
I wanna see a picture

184
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,501
Oh no forget it, I don't wanna ruin your perfect image of me

185
00:09:57,715 --> 00:09:58,671
Too late

186
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:09,081
Ok, Mr. protégé piano guy, how's this one?

187
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:12,038
That was it, that was it! That was a perfect A-flat

188
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:13,701
Shut up! You're a bad liar

189
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:16,693
No, I'm not lying, I'm still deafened from when you did your C-sharp

190
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:17,781
Hey!

191
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,192
Guess I should get you a cab

192
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:39,383
Or I could come upstairs and take a peek at your new wall color

193
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:43,852
Hahaha .. That's funny, oh wait here comes one, taxi!

194
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,391
No, Matt, I'm not expected home ..

195
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,626
There you go, alright I'll call you later, bye!

196
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:00,635
That guy couldn't get rid of you fast enough!

197
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:23,143
Thanks Archie that's sweet, ok, talk to you later

198
00:11:23,777 --> 00:11:28,281
Agh, what kind of a guy calls an hour after a date to say he had a good time

199
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:29,977
I think he's a little too into me

200
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:33,082
He spent all night touching my arm, and trying to hold my hand

201
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:37,984
Oh poor Hilda! Nice guy can't keep his hands off of you, how awful!

202
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:40,466
Excuse me, what is your problem?

203
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:43,137
My problem is that you've been complaining about Archie

204
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:44,996
Since the two of you started seeing each other

205
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:49,010
He's so into me, he calls just to say nice things

206
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,978
If it bothers you that much, then why don't you just break up with him?

207
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:55,228
Maybe you're right, I tried to do the nice guy thing

208
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:56,854
What can I say, he's just not my type

209
00:11:57,936 --> 00:12:01,894
What are you doing home anyway, I thought tonight was supposed to be like the night

210
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:04,132
Well apparently, it wasn't

211
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,137
What happened?

212
00:12:06,137 --> 00:12:08,199
Nothing, nothing happened

213
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:11,627
I tried to make it very clear that I wanted to stay over

214
00:12:11,627 --> 00:12:14,462
And he just laughed and put me in a cab

215
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:17,165
Well maybe he misunderstood your signals

216
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:19,158
You're very subtle, that's your style

217
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,947
Rule number 1, never be subtle

218
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:26,309
I don't know, I mean, I think subtlety works sometimes

219
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:29,531
Yeah maybe 100 years ago, in like the 1950's

220
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,851
But trust me, these days, bolder is better

221
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,418
So what, a girl's just supposed to come out and say it?

222
00:12:37,418 --> 00:12:41,487
You know, like I want to ..

223
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:45,215
You know, I mean not everybody can do that

224
00:12:45,355 --> 00:12:48,925
Oh my god! Still dry in Betty county?

225
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:51,349
Still non of your business Amanda!

226
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:54,763
Exactly! Betty in honor of us once being roommates

227
00:12:54,763 --> 00:12:57,329
I'm going to personally teach you how to be sexy

228
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:00,835
Well you know, as sexy as this can be

229
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:03,233
I will show you some of my no-fail moves

230
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:06,342
Admit it Betty, you need a little help in this department

231
00:13:06,555 --> 00:13:08,414
It'll be great for our article

232
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:13,122
- Well 
- Woooo

233
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:16,588
Get ready, Betty, sex train is coming

234
00:13:19,796 --> 00:13:21,839
Agh how lame

235
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:23,740
How cool, a poetry slam?

236
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,321
Yup Molly's super excited and I've been so busy

237
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:27,955
trying to keep this company together

238
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:30,453
I just really want it to be a great night for her

239
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:32,395
Well I'll definitely be there, I love poetry

240
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,073
It was one of my favorite classes in college

241
00:13:34,073 --> 00:13:35,290
- Really?
- Yeah

242
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:37,310
Maybe you should read this

243
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,290
I think it's pretty good although I'm not much of a poetry person

244
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,217
Softly caressing waves,  good title ..

245
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:50,580
Wow, wow

246
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,740
Wow what, wow good or wow bad

247
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:59,831
Just wow! I'm impressed that Molly's reading this, it's very personal and intimate

248
00:14:00,517 --> 00:14:02,016
It is? I thought it was about the ocean

249
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:09,587
Daniel, the ocean is a metaphor for you and her, and the two of you ..

250
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:12,491
Softly caressing ..

251
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:16,432
Wow, I mean I totally missed that, are you sure?

252
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,599
Pretty sure, I lay my head on the soft pale sand breathing in his salty scent

253
00:14:23,332 --> 00:14:25,243
Is that supposed to be my chest?

254
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:28,183
And I'm pretty sure that the rock is your head

255
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:29,434
How do you know it's my head?

256
00:14:30,238 --> 00:14:31,412
Cause it's crying?

257
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:33,835
What? Rocks don't cry

258
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,177
Wow, it's so weird to be back here

259
00:14:45,883 --> 00:14:50,527
I know right? I miss the me it was with us

260
00:14:50,727 --> 00:14:54,652
Okay, we're ready for operation Betty sexification

261
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:57,281
Amanda, I thought it was just gonna be us girls

262
00:14:57,281 --> 00:15:00,391
- It is 
- You can thank us later by taking us to lunch

263
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:03,018
Agh, this is an impossible deadline

264
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:04,825
Matt's gonna be here in two hours

265
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,986
God, where do we even begin, look at her

266
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:11,730
Umm yeah, this is a toughie, we have to stay calm

267
00:15:12,082 --> 00:15:15,004
The key is to come at your target using all six senses

268
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,025
Sound, smell, taste, touch, sight and style

269
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,646
Well technically style is ..

270
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,804
Shhh! We have to work fast and furious if we're gonna make it in time

271
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:25,306
Now, pay attention

272
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:28,400
First sense sound

273
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,592
Next sense, smell

274
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,170
Taste

275
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:44,888
Show him your lips are available and open for business

276
00:15:48,924 --> 00:15:51,096
Eat slowly and seductively

277
00:15:53,507 --> 00:15:58,978
- Touch
- Ignite his pleasure center with a soft graze

278
00:16:03,683 --> 00:16:06,285
Sight and style

279
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:09,344
Now the art of the seductive hair flick

280
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:21,701
Ok, put this on

281
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:24,561
- Now, what about those braces can those come off? 
- No

282
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,346
Can we at least lose the glasses?

283
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:28,086
I kind of need them to see

284
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:29,882
My concern is what he's going to see

285
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:31,914
Oh and don't forget about this

286
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,169
A ladle? What's this for?

287
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:35,717
You'll know when the time comes

288
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:41,922
I can't believe I'm saying this but Betty Suarez is getting some strange tonight

289
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,621
- Hey thanks guys 
- Go get him tiger

290
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:13,628
Where did he go?

291
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:15,376
Where are you?

292
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,427
Who the hell are you?

293
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:23,727
I'm your new night nanny

294
00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:25,666
The new night nanny?

295
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:27,382
What was that brawling?

296
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:32,501
Oh I was reading William Goldilocks and the three bears

297
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:35,388
I guess I got a little roarrr, carried away

298
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:38,152
I'm Sorry if I woke you up

299
00:17:38,884 --> 00:17:40,872
I'm James by the way

300
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,166
Carry on James

301
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:06,982
This place is even better than last night

302
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,582
We'll have two orders of that please

303
00:18:09,582 --> 00:18:12,160
You have got to try this dish, it's killing

304
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,029
Oh?

305
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:19,297
Don't move, you just look really pretty in that light

306
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:21,379
Oh thank you

307
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:23,101
And now you moved and it's gone

308
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:25,768
Kidding it's still on

309
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:33,140
Listen Archie, I think maybe ..

310
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,389
Archie? Archie I thought that was you how are you?

311
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:40,227
I'm, I'm good, real good

312
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:42,932
Hilda, this is Felicia, she and I used to be neighbors

313
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:45,064
Oh well we used to be more than that

314
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:49,386
Biggest mistake I ever made was letting this one slip  through my fingers

315
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:58,127
I thought I take a little break to make you flash cards and seduce you

316
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:02,865
Oh god I love your chest so warm and cozy

317
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:06,686
So I finally had a chance to read your poem

318
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:10,363
You did? What did you think?

319
00:19:10,363 --> 00:19:11,939
Yeah it's great

320
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:17,565
Had some thoughts from an editorial perspective if you want

321
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:20,375
That would be great, I would love your professional opinion

322
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,688
I'll go grab it

323
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:23,486
Got it right here

324
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:26,566
Wow you made a lot of notes

325
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,792
No no, I just kinda jotted down some ideas

326
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,817
Like um, instead of softly caressing,

327
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:34,292
Maybe the waves should be hard and crashing

328
00:19:35,103 --> 00:19:38,293
And should this rock really sprout tears?

329
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:40,194
It seems exaggerated

330
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:44,877
I mean I would buy it if the rock maybe shed a single tear once

331
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,091
Or you could just lose the image all together

332
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:51,073
Ok, you wanna tell me what this is really about?

333
00:19:52,046 --> 00:19:55,267
I know this poem is about us, you know ..

334
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,723
Having sex ..

335
00:19:57,723 --> 00:20:00,450
Yeah .. So?

336
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,499
So you're gonna read this in public

337
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:06,910
Like in front of people I work with, it's embarrassing

338
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:09,482
I see

339
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:14,016
Well the last thing I wanted to do is embarrass you

340
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:14,861
Molly come on

341
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:16,766
No it's fine, I'll just read something else

342
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:18,503
I should get back to work

343
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:27,283
You always did know how to make me laugh

344
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:31,864
I swear the biggest mistake I ever made was letting this guy slip through my fingers

345
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,973
Yeah, you mentioned that

346
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:39,049
Felicia, maybe we should get started on our food before it gets cold

347
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:41,488
Oh my god! I didn't even notice, what a jerk

348
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,431
- It was so nice meeting you 
- Yeah, you too

349
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:46,330
Call me sugar

350
00:20:48,796 --> 00:20:51,037
I'm sorry, Felicia is a bit of a talker

351
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:56,378
I know! I was like hello, we're on a date here

352
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:03,987
Come in!

353
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:08,332
Hello

354
00:21:08,511 --> 00:21:11,992
Oh hey Matt I'll be right out I'm just changing out my work clothes

355
00:21:11,992 --> 00:21:12,804
Okay

356
00:21:13,657 --> 00:21:15,563
Wow this place is cool

357
00:21:15,563 --> 00:21:17,980
Now I can see why you were so bummed out when you had to give it up

358
00:21:18,706 --> 00:21:21,474
Uh, you know we should really get going if we're gonna make that movie

359
00:21:26,227 --> 00:21:28,404
What's your hurry soldier?

360
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:40,087
Wow you look great, but the movie starts in like 20 minutes

361
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:41,027
You should probably get dressed

362
00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:43,719
Actually, I was thinking

363
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:49,698
Maybe we could just stay in tonight and relax

364
00:21:50,662 --> 00:21:55,334
Oh I made mojitos, want one?

365
00:21:55,733 --> 00:22:01,060
Uh, I'm not really a mojito kinda guy

366
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:07,472
Oh okay, well then, we could just get comfortable

367
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,556
And sit, we could sit

368
00:22:17,106 --> 00:22:19,985
Oh look what you found

369
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:25,017
Sorry, here

370
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,271
We should probably just go to that movie

371
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:36,452
Or we could stay here and you know, be together ..

372
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:47,146
Betty, I can't do this

373
00:22:47,837 --> 00:22:49,274
Matt, where are you going?

374
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:54,038
Betty I'm sorry, it's not you, it's me

375
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:14,510
- Wow, that was .. Wow 
- I know

376
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,745
- I did not expect that to happen 
- Me neither

377
00:23:17,745 --> 00:23:23,013
I .. To be honest I actually thought you were gonna break up with me

378
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:29,190
- I totally was 
- You were?

379
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,063
Yeah, if Felicia hadn't stopped by and interrupted me,

380
00:23:33,654 --> 00:23:37,179
This evening would've gone a hell of a lot differently

381
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:39,782
So what made you change your mind?

382
00:23:39,782 --> 00:23:43,894
Huh? I don't know

383
00:23:44,587 --> 00:23:47,285
You weren't gonna give me a chance until you saw another woman was into me

384
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:51,426
What? That is not true

385
00:23:53,377 --> 00:23:57,707
Okay, alright maybe it is a little bit, I usually go for that kinda guy, you know

386
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:01,479
Right .. So do I need Felicia to interrupt everyday to get you in the mood?

387
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:04,261
Cause that would be, you know, pretty complicated foreplay

388
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:10,940
No, but a little tattoo on your back wouldn't hurt

389
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,725
You know what, I'm gonna go

390
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,552
Excuse me what just happened here?

391
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,123
Thanks for a memorable night

392
00:24:22,123 --> 00:24:24,192
I was just kidding

393
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:36,318
So that is your idea of a qualified child care professional?

394
00:24:36,318 --> 00:24:38,005
Oh my god, he's completely qualified

395
00:24:38,005 --> 00:24:40,295
He's a former model and he's done diaper commercials

396
00:24:41,758 --> 00:24:46,213
Ok honestly, I thought that manny poppins might help you get your groove back

397
00:24:46,213 --> 00:24:48,143
You know, so that you can sleep better

398
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:50,889
What are you implying? My groove is perfectly fine

399
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,091
Willy, I keep your appointments remember?

400
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:59,310
And I haven't scheduled you for one of your weekly "carwashes" since before Connor

401
00:25:00,604 --> 00:25:04,564
And .. I just thought that James could wash your car for you

402
00:25:04,564 --> 00:25:06,362
It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard

403
00:25:06,441 --> 00:25:09,206
Oh come on, he's totally hot, he looks like Taye Diggs

404
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:11,401
What is it with white people and Taye Diggs?

405
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:13,567
Fine, I will call another nanny

406
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:17,718
Wait, he does already know the apartment

407
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:20,874
So he can stay .. For now

408
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:24,264
Oh and book me a Brazilian with Jonny

409
00:25:24,715 --> 00:25:25,579
Oooh

410
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:27,763
Completely unrelated

411
00:25:34,192 --> 00:25:35,492
It went horribly

412
00:25:35,522 --> 00:25:37,915
What? Our moves didn't work? Impossible

413
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:38,775
Those moves are fabby

414
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:40,012
You must've done something wrong

415
00:25:40,012 --> 00:25:41,215
Did you do the hair flick?

416
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:42,168
Or use the ladle

417
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:44,653
Guys don't worry, it wasn't your moves, it was me

418
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:46,354
The whole night was a disaster

419
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:49,919
I practically threw myself at him and he ran out the door

420
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,100
Running away from a girl screaming? That sounds like my prom night

421
00:25:53,508 --> 00:25:54,919
Oh My god he's gay

422
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:56,478
- Or a virgin 
- Or a woman

423
00:25:56,478 --> 00:25:57,852
Umm that feels right

424
00:25:58,372 --> 00:26:00,110
Well, I just, I wanna talk to him about it

425
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,043
But I can't because he just texted me and he's working through lunch

426
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,942
Um, that does not fly with me

427
00:26:06,123 --> 00:26:08,453
If I were you I would march over to his office right now

428
00:26:08,453 --> 00:26:09,561
And give him a piece of my mind

429
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:11,471
Oh Betty's not the type to do something like that

430
00:26:11,688 --> 00:26:12,953
You know what, I'm going to

431
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:15,493
Wow, aren't you full of surprises

432
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:18,979
I just .. I can't take another second of replaying last night in my head

433
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:21,502
I'll go nuts, I just need to talk to him

434
00:26:21,502 --> 00:26:23,065
Right after you buy us lunch

435
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:27,704
That's Matt's building

436
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:29,711
I don't know what I'm gonna say to him

437
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:30,814
What am I gonna say to him?

438
00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:33,610
Oh well you better think fast cause Richie Rich just left the building

439
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:35,883
No, Amanda!

440
00:26:38,641 --> 00:26:41,574
Someone's not working through lunch, we should follow him

441
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:43,890
No guys, I'm not gonna do that

442
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,936
Well if you don't, then we will

443
00:26:46,524 --> 00:26:48,275
No, no, Amanda, Marc!

444
00:26:52,707 --> 00:26:54,604
It's kinda silly, guys slow down

445
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,035
Oh god

446
00:27:05,217 --> 00:27:07,858
This is stupid, why are we doing this

447
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:10,589
I know, I just wanna finish this episode of mex in the city

448
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:12,777
And get something to eat, my stomach is eating itself

449
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:15,341
The bagel has landed

450
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:18,488
Hey

451
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:24,591
Oh-my-god, he is totally two-timing you

452
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,165
There must be an explanation for this

453
00:27:27,165 --> 00:27:30,496
Agh, let's get this show on the road, I'm starving

454
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,058
Betty?

455
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:38,763
Betty what are you doing here?

456
00:27:41,182 --> 00:27:42,947
Oh it's a beautiful day

457
00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:48,687
Matt, hey, hi

458
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:52,125
I didn't mean to follow you

459
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:57,358
I'm just still a little confused about last night and ..

460
00:27:58,036 --> 00:28:02,174
If you're with her that's fine, I mean it's not fine but ..

461
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:05,379
Oh god, I wish I wasn't here right now

462
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:07,973
- I'm Helen 
- My therapist

463
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:10,147
Why don't you join us?

464
00:28:18,918 --> 00:28:20,854
Betty sorry I said I have to work through lunch

465
00:28:21,606 --> 00:28:23,565
I just needed to see Helen

466
00:28:27,553 --> 00:28:29,208
I don't know what I'm supposed to say

467
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:34,423
You can say, or not say anything you wanna say or not say

468
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:37,007
Ok ..

469
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,259
So um, about last night

470
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:43,790
Look Matt, it was my fault

471
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:47,770
I was trying to push you into doing something you obviously don't wanna do so ..

472
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,689
No, no, no, that's not it at all

473
00:28:49,689 --> 00:28:52,957
Matt, it's fine, just tell me if you're not attracted to me

474
00:28:52,957 --> 00:28:54,435
Or if you'd rather just stay friends

475
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:56,344
No, I am attracted to you

476
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,923
Well then was it

477
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,840
Oh god, this is so embarrassing

478
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,795
Why?

479
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:09,983
Oh, are you a virgin?

480
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,225
That's okay I don't really have that much experience either

481
00:29:13,225 --> 00:29:15,289
Oh no, I've been with women

482
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:19,403
And kind of a lot of women

483
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:23,103
And really lot

484
00:29:23,377 --> 00:29:24,527
Wow

485
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:27,946
Look, look I know this must sound weird

486
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:31,945
It's just, I've been kinda lonely my whole life

487
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:35,076
In the past Matt has used sex as a way to connect to people

488
00:29:35,076 --> 00:29:38,622
So I made a contract with Helen that I wouldn't be with someone

489
00:29:38,622 --> 00:29:41,486
Until I really connected with them first

490
00:29:42,218 --> 00:29:46,142
And .. This amazing thing happened, I met you

491
00:29:46,944 --> 00:29:49,663
And I started having all these feelings

492
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:54,672
And then when the sex came up I guess I just .. I just panicked

493
00:29:56,732 --> 00:29:57,931
And how do you feel now?

494
00:30:00,994 --> 00:30:03,729
Calm, I feel calm

495
00:30:03,729 --> 00:30:04,680
Good

496
00:30:04,998 --> 00:30:06,954
I'm so glad it's out in the open

497
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:11,394
And Betty how do you feel?

498
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:17,921
Great, I feel ..

499
00:30:20,355 --> 00:30:21,222
Strange

500
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:23,490
Matt's been with hundreds of women?

501
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,494
Well he didn't say hundreds but he's definitely pointing in that direction

502
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,153
Man what a dog!

503
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:30,975
Not really helping, I know

504
00:30:30,975 --> 00:30:32,825
No you're not, can we change the subject

505
00:30:32,825 --> 00:30:35,217
Your car's coming to pick you up to take you straight to the poetry club from here

506
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:37,351
Great, you're coming right?

507
00:30:37,351 --> 00:30:40,242
Yeah, I'll be there, I'm excited to hear Molly read her poem

508
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:42,031
Oh she's not gonna read that one anymore

509
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:43,587
Why? It's so beautiful

510
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:45,123
I asked her not to

511
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:46,103
What?

512
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,332
Well you saw what it was about

513
00:30:47,332 --> 00:30:51,017
I can't exactly have her reading stuff about our sex life in front of everyone I work with

514
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:52,611
Daniel, sorry to break it to you

515
00:30:52,611 --> 00:30:54,987
But your sex life has kinda been on display for years

516
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,618
Come on, that's different

517
00:30:56,884 --> 00:30:59,732
Why? Because you don't mind people knowing that you're a playboy

518
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:03,711
But you don't want anyone to know that you cry when you're with the woman you love?

519
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:05,233
Okay, you're making me sound like an ass

520
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:06,646
Well you kind of are

521
00:31:07,356 --> 00:31:11,530
I'm sorry, but Molly's sick, and she wrote a poem about how much she loves you

522
00:31:12,368 --> 00:31:15,253
And she's brave enough to stand up in front of strangers and say that

523
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:17,627
You can be brave enough to let her

524
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,280
So we talked it through and Archie's coming over

525
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,951
Hilda, you called a guy back and apologized?

526
00:31:32,694 --> 00:31:34,919
Wow, you must really like this Archie

527
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:37,786
I know! Something happened last night,

528
00:31:37,786 --> 00:31:40,549
It's like we really .. We really connected you know

529
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:46,892
Can we maybe not talk about sex tonight?

530
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,245
Oh honey, you and Matt you're gonna be fine

531
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:50,438
I don't know Hilda

532
00:31:50,438 --> 00:31:54,188
I mean a couple of days ago I was ready to spend the night

533
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:57,242
And now I hope it doesn't even come up

534
00:31:57,447 --> 00:31:59,700
Honey he talked to his shrink about you

535
00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:01,247
Obviously you're important to him

536
00:32:01,247 --> 00:32:03,688
It's just complicated, now I'm one of hundreds

537
00:32:04,164 --> 00:32:05,682
I don't feel very special

538
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:09,625
Agh wouldn't it be great if all of life's problems could be solved with good hair

539
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,059
Alright cover up

540
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:15,660
That must be Archie, come in

541
00:32:18,592 --> 00:32:20,386
Felicia, what are you doing here?

542
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:22,512
I came to tell you to back off my man

543
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:24,258
Excuse me?

544
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:26,046
I decided I want Archie back

545
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:29,047
Oh, sorry you can't have him

546
00:32:29,762 --> 00:32:31,591
No offense but you can't stop me

547
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:34,779
Archie loves him some Vanilla ice cream

548
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:36,749
Okay you know maybe ..

549
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:40,701
Well no offense, but I don't think Archie's gonna go back to vanilla

550
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:45,287
When he has tasted hot, melted, caramel surprise

551
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:47,863
What's the surprise? Your fat ass?

552
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,927
- Oh No you didn't 
- No, no Hilda, she didn't mean that

553
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,444
Oh yes I did, and I also meant to do this

554
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,034
Oh bitch

555
00:32:57,034 --> 00:32:58,123
How do you like that

556
00:32:58,123 --> 00:33:00,693
- Hope you like eggs cause your head's about to look like one 
- No, no

557
00:33:00,693 --> 00:33:02,438
Is that all you got?

558
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,442
At least let me get these eyebrows

559
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:05,672
You're gonna hurt somebody

560
00:33:05,672 --> 00:33:07,631
Stop, stop!

561
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:08,556
Are you crazy?

562
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:10,763
What the hell is going on here?

563
00:33:24,726 --> 00:33:27,589
It's so chilly in here, do you mind if I start a fire?

564
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:28,680
Sure

565
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,993
Oh it looks like you have a little something on your shirt

566
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:51,871
Oh I guess the baby spit up a little

567
00:33:51,871 --> 00:33:53,220
It's no big deal

568
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,951
Oh nonsense, let me wash it, I was just about to do a little laundry

569
00:33:59,488 --> 00:34:00,541
Okay

570
00:34:10,045 --> 00:34:13,189
- Thank you 
- You're welcome, thank you!

571
00:34:21,912 --> 00:34:23,881
Thank you, thank you

572
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:30,746
Hey hey, I'm really glad that we talked with Helen today

573
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:33,132
I mean it was weird, but I'm glad

574
00:34:33,132 --> 00:34:35,433
Yeah yeah me too

575
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:41,938
Who's that?

576
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:44,626
Oh she works at the coffee shop near my apartment

577
00:34:45,658 --> 00:34:49,772
Hey hey, it's the only place I know her from in case you're wondering

578
00:34:49,772 --> 00:34:53,382
What? No, no, I wasn't wondering anything

579
00:34:57,937 --> 00:34:59,552
Your shirt will be done soon

580
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:03,922
So in the mean time why don't we ..

581
00:35:19,824 --> 00:35:24,572
- Are you okay? 
- I'm fine

582
00:35:28,236 --> 00:35:31,476
And there I sit wrapped oh so tight against the night

583
00:35:32,516 --> 00:35:37,420
In my insecurity, like it

584
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:46,253
Molly, hey I'm so sorry about what I said before

585
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:49,479
This poem you wrote is beautiful and it's touching

586
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:52,375
And I'd be so proud to hear you read it tonight

587
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:53,724
You would?

588
00:35:57,229 --> 00:35:58,443
Molly, you're up

589
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,770
Get em, take it

590
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:08,180
I'm just so angry at myself I knew I shouldn't have let Connor in

591
00:36:09,058 --> 00:36:11,178
It was against every instinct I had

592
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:15,319
Now I can't get his stupid face out of my dreams

593
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:20,498
Shh, that's it, that's it, let it out

594
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:24,911
I don't wanna let it out, I just wanna have sex

595
00:36:25,677 --> 00:36:28,654
Uh, I didn't, I didn't ..

596
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,445
Oh just take your pants off

597
00:36:30,483 --> 00:36:32,707
I don't think what you need is sex

598
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,235
What I think you need is to find a way to close the door on this Connor guy

599
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,842
And focus on your baby

600
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,717
Well thank you James

601
00:36:49,661 --> 00:36:52,343
I think you really helped me

602
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:56,274
And since we won't be having sex, now you're fired

603
00:36:57,879 --> 00:37:01,445
Get out .. Out

604
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:13,239
Oh great thank you

605
00:37:31,928 --> 00:37:33,520
Betty, Betty you're okay?

606
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:38,556
Sorry, I'm gonna go say bye to Daniel

607
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:49,786
Did you finally get rid of her?

608
00:37:49,786 --> 00:37:53,036
Yeah and don't worry Felicia won't bother you anymore I promise

609
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:54,819
Oh I know

610
00:37:55,935 --> 00:37:58,147
So what's going on here?

611
00:37:58,147 --> 00:38:01,101
Yesterday you're not into me and today you're fighting for me

612
00:38:01,414 --> 00:38:02,882
I thought I wasn't your type

613
00:38:02,882 --> 00:38:05,586
Ok, I know it was a really dumb thing to say

614
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:10,580
Especially since my type hasn't really worked out for me so well

615
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:15,897
I just wanted to see what it would be like you know with a nice guy

616
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,701
Hilda I like you but I'm sorry to warn you I have a type too

617
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:23,977
I think I sorta go for the bad girls

618
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:26,079
You think I'm a bad girl?

619
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:29,050
Well maybe I'm a little bad but..

620
00:38:29,981 --> 00:38:33,905
You loved it, two girls going at it over you

621
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:37,354
Please, I'm a grown man, I hardly think I need to get my thrills ..

622
00:38:37,354 --> 00:38:41,017
- You loved it 
- I know it was really hot

623
00:38:44,634 --> 00:38:47,009
So what are we saying? We're giving us another chance?

624
00:38:47,746 --> 00:38:48,931
Yeah

625
00:38:49,608 --> 00:38:54,857
And oh by the way, I'm not always such a nice guy

626
00:38:55,763 --> 00:38:56,958
I know

627
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,570
I'm home

628
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:03,699
Oh my god Imma start ringing the bell

629
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:12,941
I liked Molly's poem

630
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:14,168
Yeah

631
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,840
Does Daniel cry at work too?

632
00:39:17,336 --> 00:39:18,479
Not everyday

633
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:20,939
So I guess I should get a cab

634
00:39:20,939 --> 00:39:25,688
Wait Betty wait, I was thinking maybe you could come back to my place

635
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:28,692
See my new wall color, I mean if you want

636
00:39:29,724 --> 00:39:31,523
Matt, I don't know

637
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,869
- You're freaked out
- Yeah

638
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:38,860
I just .. I wanted to be special and ..

639
00:39:39,826 --> 00:39:42,932
I'm sorry but right now I just .. I feel like a number

640
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,385
You are! Number one

641
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:47,940
- Come on, Matt I'm serious 
- No so am I

642
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:55,429
Betty, this would be the first time that I have ever been with a woman I really care about

643
00:39:56,121 --> 00:39:59,043
So technically, you are my first

644
00:40:00,293 --> 00:40:05,474
Aww, that's so corny and sweet

645
00:40:07,502 --> 00:40:12,413
- I make myself nervous my hands are shaking 
- No, don't worry, so are mine

646
00:40:28,998 --> 00:40:30,858
This one goes out to the woman I love

647
00:40:31,311 --> 00:40:34,278
A classic from my high school battle of the bands

648
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:40,147
We're driving down the highway

649
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,955
Cold wind in my hair

650
00:40:43,185 --> 00:40:45,814
Just me and my special lady

651
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:51,253
We haven't got a care .. In the world

652
00:40:55,069 --> 00:41:00,785
But the road ahead's uncertain, there'll be bumps along the way

653
00:41:01,005 --> 00:41:08,834
And I know there'll be some hurting so I hit the gas and pray

654
00:41:11,506 --> 00:41:14,233
Well I don't wanna crash and burn

655
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:17,495
Don't wanna go too fast

656
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:23,240
Wanna be with you, wanna see this through

657
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:26,360
I don't wanna crash and burn

658
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,528
Don't wanna go too fast

659
00:41:29,618 --> 00:41:32,990
I want to be with you

660
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:39,232
Wanna make this last forever

661
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:45,441
And ever my lady

662
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:48,161
