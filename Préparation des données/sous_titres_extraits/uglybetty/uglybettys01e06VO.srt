1
00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:01,905
Previously on "Ugly Betty"...

2
00:00:01,915 --> 00:00:04,593
Why do they say that's not
your social security number?

3
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:07,338
You can't get one if you're
in this country illegally.

4
00:00:07,348 --> 00:00:08,631
I need you to find my watch.

5
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:11,203
Pretty sure I left it at some
woman's apartment last week.

6
00:00:11,213 --> 00:00:13,356
He dates anything that moves,

7
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:16,142
and I agree to smile
and take their messages.

8
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:20,148
You may want to return some of these.
Nico's called twice.

9
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:21,564
Hi, mom.

10
00:00:21,577 --> 00:00:24,260
Who's filling his head with
stories about me and Fey?

11
00:00:24,273 --> 00:00:25,665
Who gave my son the music box?

12
00:00:25,678 --> 00:00:30,529
I think it's time for Fey
Sommers to come out of seclusion.

13
00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:34,721
He could be deported?

14
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:38,372
Very strong possibility, yes.

15
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:40,132
But he has a family.

16
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:42,653
He pays taxes. He's a Mets fan.

17
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:43,962
He's in Oprah's book club.

18
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,400
Given what you've told me, it's likely
your father's been red-flagged.

19
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:50,100
Red-flagged? Is that bad?

20
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,963
It means that the government is
investigating, and ultimately,

21
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:55,752
a judge could rule to have
you sent back to Mexico.

22
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:57,620
You coulda just said "bad."

23
00:00:57,637 --> 00:00:59,531
Mr. Suarez,
there's something I have to ask.

24
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:01,900
You've been here for what,
30 years?

25
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:04,142
All that time,
you never applied for a green card.

26
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:06,683
Never began the
citizenship process.

27
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:08,600
What about the
amnesty in the '80s?

28
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:10,803
I was a little busy
providing for my family.

29
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:11,900
Is that such a problem?

30
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:12,912
Dad.

31
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:15,052
Look, the past is past.

32
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:17,033
I wanna talk about now.

33
00:01:17,048 --> 00:01:19,500
How much will it cost
for you to help us?

34
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:20,962
Now this meeting was pro bono.

35
00:01:20,975 --> 00:01:24,602
My wife asked me because she
loves your daughter's products.

36
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:28,412
Hilda, by the way,
that fiber loss really cleaned her out.

37
00:01:28,428 --> 00:01:30,850
But a case like this...

38
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:32,982
you wanna save your father...

39
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:35,401
it starts with a retainer.

40
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:41,130
20 grand?

41
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:43,633
Do you validate?

42
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:46,601
Hey, slow down.

43
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:48,910
Oh, after last night,
I think I need a walker.

44
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:49,841
We are late.

45
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:52,523
Wilhelmina's meeting about the
"Must Mode" issue's about to start.

46
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:54,413
Cruella devil can wait.

47
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:56,860
Hey, your lost watch--
did you ever figure out

48
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,970
- which girl's apartment you left it at?
- No, Betty never told me.

49
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,210
We should probably take
separate elevators.

50
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:11,520
Wouldn't want the office
getting the wrong idea.

51
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:13,640
Right. Because my panties
stuffed in your paper shredder

52
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:16,071
probably didn't tip 'em off.

53
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,923
Great.

54
00:02:36,938 --> 00:02:38,450
Just great.

55
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:41,602
Could I help you out? I got a lot
of women's clothes up in my office.

56
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:42,440
Hold this, please.

57
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,630
Fashionable clothes...
up in the office.

58
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:46,580
What are you doing?

59
00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:49,261
You gotta do what you gotta do.

60
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:52,871
Fastest first date
I've ever had.

61
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:55,112
You can't be serious.

62
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:59,852
You actually think you've
got a shot here, now?

63
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:01,691
Just joking.

64
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:04,061
You smiled at me in the lobby.

65
00:03:04,078 --> 00:03:06,942
I smiled 'cause I couldn't believe
you pulled a ditch and dash

66
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:09,162
with that poor girl back there.

67
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,332
You let it all play out in your head,
didn't you?

68
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:16,001
You, me,

69
00:03:16,018 --> 00:03:18,151
no one else here.

70
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:22,042
We'd be on the floor,
bodies sweating,

71
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:24,823
rug burn on my back.

72
00:03:26,396 --> 00:03:31,072
Well, so much for that fantasy.

73
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:36,563
As we do every year for
our "Must Mode" issue,

74
00:03:36,578 --> 00:03:41,562
your ideas, your picks, your lists
will be considered for inclusion.

75
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:52,601
Nico,  I told you,
only emergencies.

76
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:56,581
No, you cannot submit my
apartment for "Pimp Yo House."

77
00:03:56,595 --> 00:03:58,201
Good-bye.

78
00:03:59,755 --> 00:04:03,223
Family is staying
with me temporarily.

79
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:05,160
Remember, it's not
just an "it" list.

80
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:07,883
There are personal
"musts" as well.

81
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:11,600
Like must be on time.

82
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:15,160
For others,
it's a bit more profound.

83
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:18,100
What's important is that
we tap into the issues

84
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:20,980
of our readers' lives
they cannot face,

85
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:24,073
move them to the next
stage in their lives,

86
00:04:24,085 --> 00:04:26,381
promise them it
won't be another year

87
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:31,170
full of unanswered questions
and unresolved issues,

88
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:33,002
and lest we forget,

89
00:04:33,015 --> 00:04:37,050
it is about the fashion
"must-haves" for 2007,

90
00:04:37,065 --> 00:04:41,923
and I can assure you it will
not include polka-dots.

91
00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:43,560
That's it.

92
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:45,561
Start listing.

93
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:51,811
You have an 11:30 layout conference,
and your father's office called.

94
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:53,732
There's an editors-in-chief
meeting tomorrow.

95
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:57,003
So listen, there's this
woman--smoking hot--works on 27.

96
00:04:57,016 --> 00:04:59,012
She's not wearing a shirt,
had some sort of accident.

97
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:02,100
I really--I need you to
find out who she is, okay?

98
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:06,402
"Must" hunt down Daniel's babe.

99
00:05:08,136 --> 00:05:10,531
Whatever Bradford Meade does,

100
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:12,510
he can't get rid ome.

101
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:15,561
Sometimes it's like
she's still here.

102
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:21,082
You remember what tomorrow is,
don't you?

103
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:25,360
How could I forget?

104
00:05:32,106 --> 00:05:34,573
Nico, darling, I'm home.

105
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:37,452
What is that?

106
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:40,100
Dinner. You didn't have much.

107
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:41,650
My wine,

108
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:44,201
and pecorino di pienza.

109
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:47,033
It's a cheese.
Goes great with pears.

110
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,531
And cereal goes
great with milk.

111
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:51,231
How  was your day, dear?

112
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:53,171
I picked these up today--

113
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:55,613
brochures for
schools in New York.

114
00:05:55,627 --> 00:05:56,880
Don't be silly.

115
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:58,932
Schools here don't
meet your standards.

116
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:02,311
I was thinking of the Hertzog
school in Switzerland.

117
00:06:02,326 --> 00:06:04,120
Expelled, remember?

118
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:07,491
So I'm starting to think maybe
boarding school's not for me.

119
00:06:07,657 --> 00:06:09,572
I said the same
thing to the senator

120
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:11,581
when he sent me to
the Chamberlin school.

121
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:14,690
He'd just won his first
congressional seat.

122
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:16,930
- He told me--
- "Willie, D.C. is no place

123
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:19,313
for my daughter to
become a young lady."

124
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:21,112
Same thing goes for
you in New York.

125
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:23,781
Boarding school has a 
far better education,

126
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:27,502
far better people
and far better food

127
00:06:27,518 --> 00:06:30,501
than... Captain Crisp.

128
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:31,630
"Cap'N."

129
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:34,810
I don't think he's an
official maritime officer.

130
00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:39,611
Dad, is this everything
from Mexico?

131
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,401
Yeah, birth
certificate, passport,

132
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:44,662
maybe even an old baby picture.

133
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:47,022
Careful. I might be
naked in that one.

134
00:06:47,037 --> 00:06:49,620
The lawyer's gonna
need these documents.

135
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:51,591
Yeah,  the lawyer
we can't afford.

136
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:53,891
You know, dad, there's enough here.
You could have applied for a green card.

137
00:06:53,926 --> 00:06:57,471
I mean, you were here in '86,
and Reagan offered the amnesty.

138
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:59,490
I, uh...

139
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:02,080
I missed it. Okay?

140
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:06,950
Look, I-I'm sorry I'm
putting you through all this.

141
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:10,521
But maybe if we tighten our belts,
got second jobs, maybe--

142
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:13,043
Dad, I really want to help, but

143
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:15,350
my first job is hard
enough as it is.

144
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:17,225
Not if you maximize
your time there.

145
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:18,369
Hilda, don't go there again.

146
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,201
I am not gonna sell
Herbalux at "Mode."

147
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:23,930
What model doesn't wanna lose weight?
It's easy money.

148
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:26,702
It's not the worst
idea in the world.

149
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:30,451
I will set you up with a basic
package just to tease 'em.

150
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,193
What's this?

151
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:39,853
Looks like somebody
was torn out.

152
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:45,241
Ah, it's nothing.

153
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:49,043
Just a photo of mom
with an old boyfriend.

154
00:07:49,057 --> 00:07:50,700
Ooh, let me see.

155
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,773
A boyfriend?

156
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:55,181
I thought you said you were
each other's first loves.

157
00:07:55,196 --> 00:07:57,833
Can you stop with
the damn questions?

158
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:04,442
I'm going for a walk.

159
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:07,333
If it's okay, Betty.

160
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:13,893
What is with you? Obviously,
he is sensitive about all of this.

161
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:16,171
Well, there's something
he's not telling us.

162
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:19,312
We're just trying to help him, Hilda.
We deserve to know.

163
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,602
Doesn't that upset you?

164
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:23,513
Of course it does,
but getting upset doesn't help.

165
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:24,662
He's always been
there for us, Betty.

166
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:27,593
We just--we gotta be
there for him now.

167
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,062
Fine. I'll sell
Herbalux at "Mode."

168
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:32,570
I mean,
I'd do anything I have to,

169
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:35,111
but I'm not gonna just
let him off the hook,

170
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:38,150
not until he tells
us the truth.

171
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,041
Okay, give it back to me, girl.

172
00:08:58,058 --> 00:09:01,350
The vita valu pack contains all
essential vitamins from A to Z.

173
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:03,422
You know there's no such
thing as vitamin Z?

174
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:05,663
Hello, it's a
catchy sales pitch.

175
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:08,181
And what is more important
than the vitamin content?

176
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:11,290
You get it half off when purchased
with the nitro nutrient combo.

177
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:13,820
Right. Now the customers
have to have confidence

178
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:15,662
in you and the product,
so don't be afraid

179
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:18,450
to really just put
yourself out there.

180
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:20,653
Tired of sticking your
finger down your throat?

181
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,252
Wanna lose weight the easy way?
Ask me how!

182
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:25,352
Herbalux can help.

183
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:28,151
It's a good line.
I might use it.

184
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,691
Now you're ready for
your secret weapon.

185
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,462
10 pounds in 10 days.

186
00:09:32,477 --> 00:09:34,073
Oh, god.
Do I really need to wear that?

187
00:09:34,086 --> 00:09:36,011
I remember when I got pinned.

188
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:38,160
Shelly Jenkins
did me the honor.

189
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,992
Did she get you a
limo and a corsage?

190
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:44,703
Can I please go to work
and humiliate myself now?

191
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:46,310
Yes. Yes, you may.

192
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:51,071
Shelly always said, "hit 'em with
the appetizer prices before lunch."

193
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:55,021
Happy Herbaluxing!

194
00:10:08,018 --> 00:10:09,793
Good morning, Marc.

195
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:12,062
I think I have something here
that might interest you.

196
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:14,650
Hmm. Unless it's Taye
Diggs covered in baby oil,

197
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:15,450
I doubt it.

198
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:17,531
I see that you're enjoying
a healthy smoothie.

199
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:19,513
Did you know scientists today
are making great strides

200
00:10:19,546 --> 00:10:20,962
in the health
supplement market?

201
00:10:20,976 --> 00:10:23,123
And most of those scientists
are working in the Herbalux lab

202
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:24,332
in Hoboken, New Jersey.

203
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:28,131
- In fact, Herbalux--
- Could you please just--

204
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:30,713
10 pounds?

205
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,743
- Reach for the stars.
- Marc...

206
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:36,003
we have some phone calls to make,
don't we?

207
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:37,140
Yeah.

208
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:40,890
Work those halls,
you little diet diva.

209
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:52,460
I  don't like it when she smiles.
It's so metallic.

210
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:53,823
What did she want?

211
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:57,651
Looks like she's trying to earn
a few extra pesos for something.

212
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,552
Interesting.

213
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:03,043
What's the status on the
list of boarding schools?

214
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:04,830
London and Milan passed.

215
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:08,883
There's still one school in Paris
that hasn't heard of Nico, I think.

216
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:11,531
C'est parfait.
Get them on the phone.

217
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:14,391
Oh, and before I forget,

218
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:16,293
you're meeting with
Daniel's been pushed.

219
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:18,610
He's at a meeting in
Bradford's office--

220
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:21,103
editors-in-chief only.

221
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:24,202
Well, I'm sure Skippy's
holding his own.

222
00:11:31,998 --> 00:11:33,752
My pleasure.

223
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:44,950
I like mine black, two sugars.

224
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:47,011
You want me to get you coffee?

225
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:48,840
I think that's why you're here.

226
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:52,433
Oh, and what gave it away?
Was it my accent?

227
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,570
Actually, the fact that
you're the only person here

228
00:11:54,585 --> 00:11:57,062
who doesn't edit a
Meade publication.

229
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:59,500
You're an editor.

230
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:03,782
Wow. I bet that gets
you all the girls, huh?

231
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:07,472
Uh, usually, my magazine's
circulation count does the trick.

232
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:10,161
Circulation count.

233
00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:13,251
Why? Is it big?

234
00:12:13,268 --> 00:12:15,732
Well, I don't like to brag,

235
00:12:15,746 --> 00:12:19,000
but I am in the top five.

236
00:12:19,017 --> 00:12:21,863
Oh, my god. Listen, I'm sorry.

237
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:23,313
I'm new here,

238
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:26,123
and I'm not really that
familiar with everyone yet.

239
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:28,033
- Of course, I'm--
- Daniel Meade,

240
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:29,751
"Mode" magazine--

241
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:33,561
the only one in this room
who was born into his job.

242
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:36,303
All right,
let's get started, everyone.

243
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,312
I have news.

244
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:42,033
Some might call
it exciting news.

245
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:45,990
In january, Meade publishing
launches a new weekly...

246
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:48,811
targeting the
empowered modern woman.

247
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:50,272
You'll all get the press release.
The point is,

248
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:53,180
that I wish to introduce
the best-selling author

249
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:57,231
and editorial brains behind
our new magazine, "M.Y.W.,"

250
00:12:57,245 --> 00:12:59,300
Sofia Reyes.

251
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:02,092
Sofia, what's the name
of your new book?

252
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:05,293
"Making your man a bottom."

253
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:12,370
And Herba-aid doesn't just hydrate.
It contains protein,

254
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:14,731
which helps to repair the
muscle after your workout.

255
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:15,590
Terrific.

256
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:17,060
I told you you can't be here.

257
00:13:17,077 --> 00:13:19,393
What is your problem?
I was mid-sale.

258
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:20,220
Hey, hey!

259
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:21,963
You don't want me to call the cops,
do you?

260
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:24,212
- Ow!
- What could you possibly tell them?

261
00:13:24,228 --> 00:13:25,880
This doesn't
concern you, ma'am.

262
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:27,021
Let me worry about that.

263
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:28,340
You worry about calling
me "ma'am" again

264
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,230
and getting this yoga
mat upside your head.

265
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:31,963
Look, I was just
gonna leave anyway--

266
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,772
Stay where you are. You?
You need to apologize.

267
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:35,933
- Oh, me?
- Yeah.

268
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:37,182
She's the one breaking the law.

269
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:39,012
You're such a legal expert,
tell me what it says

270
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:41,503
in subchapter 27 of
chapter 2 of title 20

271
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:43,113
of the New York City
administrative code

272
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:45,433
about the occupation
allicensing of vendors.

273
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:47,330
Or how about the constitution,

274
00:13:47,345 --> 00:13:50,431
a little thing called
"freedom of assembly"?

275
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:56,950
Yeah, well,
you can forget about your free towel.

276
00:13:58,927 --> 00:14:00,841
That was amazing.

277
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:02,952
You know what?
Don't tell him, but that subchapter

278
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,043
applies to disabled
veterans only.

279
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:06,550
How you doing? I'm Leah.

280
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:08,843
Hi. I'm Hilda. 

281
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:11,622
- So you're, like, a lawyer?
- Yeah.

282
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:13,770
- Oh, hold on one second.
- Sure.

283
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:16,162
Hello?

284
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:18,071
She's wearing a
wedding ring, Hilda.

285
00:14:18,085 --> 00:14:19,441
What are you talking about?

286
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:22,101
The torn picture of mom.
She's wearing a wedding ring.

287
00:14:22,118 --> 00:14:24,123
So? It's a picture
of mom and dad.

288
00:14:24,137 --> 00:14:26,193
No, they weren't
married in '75,

289
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:28,761
and  dad said that was an old
picture of her boyfriend.

290
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:30,423
- Can you just give me one second?
- Actually, I gotta go,

291
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:31,971
but if you need anything,
call me.

292
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:34,171
You know, truth of the matter is,
best place to find me is here.

293
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,720
I get my yoga on
8:00 every morning.

294
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:37,162
Okay, thank you!

295
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:38,481
Hilda, are you listening to me?

296
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:40,353
Yeah, yeah, I heard you.
Mystery photo.

297
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:42,981
Stop playing Nancy Drew.
You're supposed to be selling.

298
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:44,961
So how you doing?

299
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:47,003
Betty, what are your numbers?

300
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:49,970
Well, uh, Christina bought
$10 worth of protein bars.

301
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:53,220
She likes the taste.
Of course, she eats sheep's stomach.

302
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:55,330
10 bucks? Great.

303
00:14:55,348 --> 00:14:59,021
Well, dad could buy a set of maracas
when he's sent back to Mexico.

304
00:14:59,717 --> 00:15:02,750
You're not wearing the secret weapon,
are you?

305
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:04,950
I am coming down to "Mode,"

306
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:07,062
and I'm gonna show
you how it's done.

307
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:08,000
What?

308
00:15:08,018 --> 00:15:10,101
Wait, no! Hilda.

309
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:11,520
Oh, my god.

310
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:14,641
Oh, things with Nico are fine.

311
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:17,181
Ilse's steaming her
pores as we speak.

312
00:15:17,197 --> 00:15:20,053
Good. While you've
been playing mommy,

313
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:23,112
I've been planning
something for Bradford.

314
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:25,731
That's right.
Today's a special day, huh?

315
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:27,512
I wonder how he'll celebrate.

316
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:29,883
I'm sure the way Bradford
Meade and Fey Sommers

317
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:32,593
always celebrated
their birthdays--

318
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:34,001
together.

319
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,722
Anything I can do to help?

320
00:15:35,738 --> 00:15:36,820
No.

321
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:40,190
It's a birthday
date for two only.

322
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:44,053
I am more concerned with what
you have planned for Daniel.

323
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,332
He seems to finding his
footing there these days.

324
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,692
You do realize it will
be impossible for us

325
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,180
to take over the company

326
00:15:51,196 --> 00:15:53,703
if he's got any power there.

327
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:58,522
I know. The little nugget
remains a threat to our plans.

328
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:01,602
But short of taking
a bat to his knees...

329
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,840
I like where you're going.

330
00:16:03,857 --> 00:16:05,652
It just occurred to me,

331
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,723
maybe the one thing
we can exploit

332
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:13,082
is the person who's been
propping him up all this time.

333
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:18,803
It's an emergency--

334
00:16:18,817 --> 00:16:22,132
Bergmans. Shoplifting. Nico!

335
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:26,813
She made me feel
like a complete ass.

336
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,331
Women don't treat me like that.

337
00:16:28,346 --> 00:16:30,422
Not the women you usually date.

338
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:32,351
Didn't I ask you to
find out who she was?

339
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,542
Yes, I'm sorry some
things came up.

340
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:36,880
Besides, a no-shirt
hottie with an accent?

341
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,670
Daniel, that's every model
who walks through this office.

342
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:42,113
You could have been a
little bit more specific.

343
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:45,182
Daniel, Sofia Reyes.
She--she's a best-selling author.

344
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:47,892
The "Times" profiled
her last month.

345
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:50,390
And, oh, yeah.
ABC News reported rumors

346
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:52,400
of this magazine
launch last week.

347
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,480
Books, newspapers, ABC News.

348
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:56,172
I pay attention to
which of those?

349
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:56,993
None.

350
00:16:57,007 --> 00:17:00,340
Exactly. She thinks I'm nothing
but an unqualified himbo

351
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:03,233
who got the job 
because of my father.

352
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:05,113
Don't say anything.

353
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:08,481
Betty, this woman had me figured
out like no one I've ever met.

354
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,571
She was ten steps ahead
of me on every point.

355
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:11,623
So just apologize.

356
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:13,770
Ah, I can't just apologize.

357
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:17,462
I mean, it's gotta be smarter.
You know, skillful.

358
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:21,160
Something... profound.

359
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:26,303
Jewelry!

360
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,292
Call Nigel over at Tiffany.

361
00:17:28,307 --> 00:17:31,671
Tell him to send
over the usual.

362
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,903
Oh, miss Slater, there you are.

363
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,032
You put me in here.

364
00:17:40,046 --> 00:17:42,213
Well, there must have
been some mistake.

365
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:43,913
Obviously, you were
completely unaware

366
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:45,861
the dress had been
placed in your bag.

367
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:47,620
Not really.
I shoved it in there.

368
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:49,713
But clearly,
you thought you'd paid for it.

369
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:52,342
We'll just forget
this whole mess.

370
00:17:52,357 --> 00:17:54,223
You talked to my mother,
didn't you?

371
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:58,251
This store considers Ms.
Slater to be one of its dearest friends.

372
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:01,241
As she does you.

373
00:18:01,258 --> 00:18:03,981
Oh. She sent her bitch.

374
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:06,680
I'll leave you two alone.

375
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:11,421
Nico...

376
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:12,662
Marc.

377
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,401
Did you really think that
imitating that very special episode

378
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:18,812
of "Punky Brewster" was gonna
get your mother's attention?

379
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,653
So... this is it, huh?

380
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:25,610
Looks like a gay
version of "Star Trek."

381
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:27,382
So you ready to start selling?

382
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,040
Are you ready to
start listening?

383
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:30,571
No, I did not come 
here for that.

384
00:18:30,588 --> 00:18:33,422
Hilda, look at this hand.
This does not belong to dad.

385
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:36,102
- The pigmentation is all wrong--
- Pigmentation?

386
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:38,883
Are you selling Herbalux, or are you
getting an online forensics degree?

387
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:39,670
- Hilda--
- No.

388
00:18:39,688 --> 00:18:41,552
The more we argue,
the less we sell.

389
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:43,783
Are you serious about this?
Because I tried.

390
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:45,732
It is just really demeaning.

391
00:18:45,745 --> 00:18:48,163
I  would put on a chicken
suit and stand on the corner

392
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:51,570
if we could make the type
of cash you'd make here.

393
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:55,490
Come on. It's for dad.

394
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,603
Fine, but lose that
stupid cutout.

395
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:03,242
Oh, no,
you did not just insult Melanie.

396
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:12,741
Five... four...

397
00:19:12,757 --> 00:19:14,893
three... two...

398
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:16,330
10 pounds?

399
00:19:16,346 --> 00:19:18,790
Is that, like, for real?

400
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,793
What the hell is going on?

401
00:19:51,806 --> 00:19:54,793
Actually, uh,
you see, it's, uh...

402
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:56,680
Do you realize how many
rules you've broken?

403
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:58,021
Oh, really?

404
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:03,673
Can you tell me what subchapter
20 of article, chapter 27...

405
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:09,111
The constitution says
freedom of assembly.

406
00:20:09,128 --> 00:20:10,510
How cute.

407
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:12,703
Cesar Chavez in a push-up bra.

408
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:14,811
This is private
property, sweetheart.

409
00:20:14,828 --> 00:20:16,932
Pack up your stuff and get out.

410
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:18,912
And you, in my office.

411
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,822
Now!

412
00:20:21,146 --> 00:20:24,511
Candace Bushnell wants to pitch you
a story on power women in Manhattan.

413
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:27,820
Tell her to call when she
gets an original idea.

414
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:30,021
Multitasking?

415
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:33,373
Oh, my new friend,
Daniel Meade.

416
00:20:33,386 --> 00:20:34,711
Friend?

417
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:38,521
It didn't seem too friendly when you
sent this gift back to my office.

418
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:40,342
The necklace.

419
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:43,313
It's absolutely lovely.

420
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:45,120
But not for me.

421
00:20:45,136 --> 00:20:46,492
Not your taste?

422
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:48,333
No, not for me.

423
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:50,562
It's very generic, Daniel.

424
00:20:50,575 --> 00:20:54,120
It's the kind of gift you give
to the girl you just banged,

425
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:55,843
or the one you wanna bang.

426
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,693
Whoa, can we back up a second?

427
00:20:57,706 --> 00:21:00,163
You clearly have the
wrong impression of me.

428
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,851
- Really?
- Really.

429
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:05,120
Lara?

430
00:21:06,697 --> 00:21:11,861
You know, I...
thought I recognized you.

431
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:15,560
Daniel doesn't have
to know about this.

432
00:21:15,577 --> 00:21:18,293
Secrets can stay
between friends, right?

433
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:19,552
Friends?

434
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:24,351
Well, at "Mode," I think
of all of us as family...

435
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,762
and family sticks together

436
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:29,680
through the good
times and the bad.

437
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:33,693
Do you know Rodrigo in styles?

438
00:21:33,705 --> 00:21:35,782
Sure. He has great taste.

439
00:21:35,797 --> 00:21:37,271
Impeccable,

440
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:40,751
but you wouldn't know that
if an anonymous donor

441
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:44,231
hadn't paid his way
through design school.

442
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,261
Betty...

443
00:21:46,277 --> 00:21:50,530
strong people are the
ones who ask for help.

444
00:21:50,637 --> 00:21:52,312
Um...

445
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:54,820
my father, uh...

446
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:57,233
is going through some...

447
00:21:57,246 --> 00:21:59,760
some legal problems,

448
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:02,542
and my family was told that

449
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:05,933
for a good,
supposedly great, lawyer,

450
00:22:05,948 --> 00:22:09,340
it would cost us $20,000.

451
00:22:09,355 --> 00:22:15,483
Well, Betty, I have a daughter
I would do anything for,

452
00:22:15,495 --> 00:22:20,302
just as you would do
anything for your father,

453
00:22:20,316 --> 00:22:22,292
I'm sure.

454
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:30,681
What do you want in return?

455
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:34,080
Is that something
you ask family?

456
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,500
Happy birthday, Fey.

457
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:01,571
So sorry.

458
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,391
I wish you knew how
much I missed you.

459
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:09,083
Fey?

460
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,842
Do you know what this means?

461
00:23:20,855 --> 00:23:23,390
It's blood money.
It's her way of getting to Daniel.

462
00:23:23,407 --> 00:23:25,652
Once you cash that,
you belong to her.

463
00:23:25,668 --> 00:23:26,811
No, I know that,

464
00:23:26,827 --> 00:23:29,600
but do you know what number
one on my "must" list is?

465
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,312
Getting my dad a lawyer.

466
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,781
This could be the answer
to my family's problems.

467
00:23:33,796 --> 00:23:35,782
That's what they say in the movies,
then they have to kill someone

468
00:23:35,817 --> 00:23:37,902
- or sleep with them or both.
- And my dad--

469
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,091
Enough about the mystery photo.

470
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:43,090
Enough about the
evil queen's check.

471
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:44,792
So what am I supposed to do?

472
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:46,473
It's half price night here 
at the Rack, which is why

473
00:23:46,505 --> 00:23:49,100
I dragged you hed -- to let go.

474
00:23:49,118 --> 00:23:51,362
Which is why I'm making that
the number one priority

475
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:53,131
on your "must" list tonight.

476
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:55,141
Well, that's easier
said than done.

477
00:23:55,156 --> 00:23:57,902
Why do you think god
invented alcohol?

478
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,702
Excuse me.
I'll have what she's having.

479
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:20,633
I thought I threw that out.

480
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:22,562
What are you doing up?

481
00:24:22,876 --> 00:24:24,663
I had work to do.

482
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:27,211
Furs for the "must" list.
Care to look at them?

483
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:28,820
Fur is murder.

484
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:32,011
I bought you a Nicole Miller
fur at for your 10th birthday.

485
00:24:32,028 --> 00:24:33,471
How could I forget?

486
00:24:33,486 --> 00:24:35,273
It was my 11th birthday.

487
00:24:35,285 --> 00:24:37,662
And you had me model
it for a photo shoot,

488
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:40,303
which you didn't
even show up for.

489
00:24:40,317 --> 00:24:44,821
I believe the excuse was
dinner with Oscar de la Renta.

490
00:24:44,837 --> 00:24:46,921
Someone had to
convince him that

491
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:49,410
fishnets were only
meant for stockings.

492
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:52,043
Nice to know you
have priorities.

493
00:24:52,528 --> 00:24:54,373
Kind of like today.

494
00:24:54,386 --> 00:24:58,613
Oh, that's right, today was your
little cry for help, wasn't it?

495
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:01,130
That was amateur, darling.

496
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:02,903
When I was 15,

497
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:06,842
Mikhail Baryshnikov came
to the Salem Academy.

498
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:09,311
Afterwards, I was caught

499
00:25:09,326 --> 00:25:13,031
doing a little dance
of my own for Misha.

500
00:25:15,187 --> 00:25:18,350
Now that is acting out.

501
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:20,522
How proud you must be.

502
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:23,121
You don't get it, do you?
Act out as much as you want.

503
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:24,563
I did.

504
00:25:24,578 --> 00:25:26,560
Seven schools...

505
00:25:26,576 --> 00:25:28,572
until it finally hit me...

506
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:31,143
until I finally understood.

507
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:34,020
Being away from home,
being away from the ones you love,

508
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:38,000
makes you strong,
builds your armor.

509
00:25:38,316 --> 00:25:42,051
Because in the end,
the only person in this world

510
00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:45,750
you can depend on is yourself.

511
00:25:45,768 --> 00:25:49,481
It's the greatest lesson
the senator ever taught me.

512
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:53,323
- Mom--
- Brush up on your french.

513
00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:56,693
You leave for school in
Paris tomorrow night.

514
00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:05,193
So...

515
00:26:05,206 --> 00:26:07,202
um...

516
00:26:07,388 --> 00:26:09,550
is everything okay?

517
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,581
The flag was kind
of at half-mast.

518
00:26:11,597 --> 00:26:14,671
Would it be generic if I sent
you a necklace from Tiffany?

519
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:17,151
Oh, no. I loved it.

520
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:20,081
You sent it to me after
our first night together.

521
00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:21,772
Of course I did.

522
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,252
And if I sent to you as a...

523
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:27,012
sort of an apology,
that'd be okay, right?

524
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:29,132
Well, that depends.

525
00:26:29,146 --> 00:26:32,960
Are you apologizing for
something in particular?

526
00:26:32,976 --> 00:26:34,343
Yeah.

527
00:26:34,357 --> 00:26:37,712
Making an ass out of
myself with Sofia Reyes,

528
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:40,133
the editor of "M.Y.W."

529
00:26:40,146 --> 00:26:42,432
I sent her a necklace
as an apology gift,

530
00:26:42,445 --> 00:26:44,860
and she called me out on it.

531
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:46,551
Oh.

532
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:50,001
So the whole apology
thing was about her,

533
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:51,220
not me.

534
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,163
What do I have to
apologize to you about?

535
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:55,230
Nothing...

536
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:58,093
I guess.

537
00:26:59,015 --> 00:27:01,491
You know,
I'm not feeling too well.

538
00:27:01,506 --> 00:27:02,950
I think I'm gonna go.

539
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:04,260
You okay?

540
00:27:04,277 --> 00:27:05,771
Yeah, I, uh...

541
00:27:05,787 --> 00:27:08,563
I think I feel one of those
24-hour flus coming on.

542
00:27:08,578 --> 00:27:11,732
I should go before
I get you sick.

543
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:49,010
Whoops.

544
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:51,510
That step's a tough one.

545
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:54,163
Why are you sneaking
in through the back?

546
00:27:54,295 --> 00:27:55,742
Are you drunk?

547
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,043
Yeah, a little bit.
I'm going to bed.

548
00:27:58,057 --> 00:27:59,473
No, no, no, no, come on.
Let me get you some water.

549
00:27:59,505 --> 00:28:00,502
- No, I'm fine.
- Come on.

550
00:28:00,516 --> 00:28:01,992
Dad, let me go!

551
00:28:02,006 --> 00:28:03,910
What's the matter with you?
What's going on?

552
00:28:03,927 --> 00:28:06,041
- Talk to me!
- Talk to you?

553
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:09,211
Why don't you talk to me?
Why don't you tell me

554
00:28:09,227 --> 00:28:12,603
why mom is wearing a wedding
band in this picture?

555
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:17,800
Or who's the guy in the
photo with her, really?

556
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,710
There you go.

557
00:28:23,728 --> 00:28:26,720
I don't have to explain myself to you.
I'm your father.

558
00:28:26,736 --> 00:28:29,171
Then act like it.

559
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:32,080
I've always looked
up to you, dad.

560
00:28:32,098 --> 00:28:35,160
Right, wrong,
I could just take your lead.

561
00:28:37,568 --> 00:28:39,680
Now I'm lost.

562
00:28:46,845 --> 00:28:49,163
A little less slamming, please.

563
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:53,792
Here. You're gonna need this.

564
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:55,202
Thanks.

565
00:28:55,247 --> 00:28:56,803
So...

566
00:28:57,677 --> 00:28:59,500
dad left early this morning.

567
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:00,843
I don't really want
to talk about this.

568
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:03,261
Well, it's a little
too late for that now.

569
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:05,661
I heard what you
said last night.

570
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:08,930
- So did half of Rego Park.
- I'm sorry.

571
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:12,450
Apologizing to me isn't
gonna change what happened.

572
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:15,782
What went on after I left
the office yesterday?

573
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,212
I got punished.

574
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:31,892
Is this real, or is this one
of those Ed McMahon things?

575
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:33,640
It'll cash.

576
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:35,712
20 grand.

577
00:29:35,726 --> 00:29:37,772
So cash it.
This is the answer--

578
00:29:37,786 --> 00:29:40,223
Hilda, look closer.

579
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,231
Wilhelmina Slater?

580
00:29:44,936 --> 00:29:48,543
- Oh, that stuck-up--
- Exactly.

581
00:29:49,405 --> 00:29:51,652
She'll want me to
sell Daniel out

582
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,923
so she can take his job.

583
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,531
Her money, my soul.

584
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,673
Look, I'm gonna try to figure
something else out, okay?

585
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:04,220
See if there's another way.

586
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:08,283
But this might be
our only option.

587
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:45,701
Can I get the number
for Fashion TV, please?

588
00:30:57,615 --> 00:30:59,582
What the hell just happened?

589
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:01,863
You're getting back at me,
aren't you?

590
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:03,700
For yesterday?

591
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:06,083
- You planned this.
- Planned this? Are you s--

592
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:08,682
Yeah. I got a side job
with the elevator union.

593
00:31:08,697 --> 00:31:11,260
Really? I'll take
the stairs next time.

594
00:31:11,276 --> 00:31:12,762
Do you always get
the last word in?

595
00:31:12,775 --> 00:31:14,482
Only with you, baby.

596
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,593
Great.

597
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:18,050
Last time this happened was
four hours of Kevin Federline

598
00:31:18,065 --> 00:31:19,740
trying to cornrow my hair.

599
00:31:19,758 --> 00:31:22,092
No reception. What now?

600
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:24,182
I think we're between floors.
If I could just get up there,

601
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,710
I could pry the door
open on the next floor.

602
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:29,910
Somebody's seen "Die
hard" too many times.

603
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:36,132
Oh! God forbid you
wrinkle your jacket.

604
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:40,232
Listen, how about
we do the obvious?

605
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:42,262
Come on. Give me a boost.

606
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:43,613
Are you serious?

607
00:31:43,626 --> 00:31:45,513
On your knees.

608
00:31:46,598 --> 00:31:49,161
And, Daniel, don't look up.

609
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:50,960
Don't flatter yourself.

610
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:57,043
Good, 'cause I'm not
wearing any underwear.

611
00:32:09,065 --> 00:32:10,750
You okay?

612
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,861
Yeah.

613
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:16,212
You looked, didn't you?

614
00:32:31,675 --> 00:32:33,361
Hilda.

615
00:32:33,455 --> 00:32:35,721
You gonna make me lose
another free towel?

616
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:37,852
No, I really wanted
to talk to you.

617
00:32:37,866 --> 00:32:41,580
Um... have you ever done
any immigration work?

618
00:32:41,595 --> 00:32:43,030
In this neighborhood?

619
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,442
And besides, once I got my degree,
my uncle Abraham

620
00:32:45,456 --> 00:32:48,251
turned his place into the
israeli underground railroad.

621
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,440
You in some kind of trouble?

622
00:32:52,028 --> 00:32:53,901
If I tell you something,

623
00:32:53,915 --> 00:32:56,692
do we have that attorney-client
privilege thing?

624
00:32:56,706 --> 00:32:58,621
That only works if
I'm your lawyer.

625
00:32:58,636 --> 00:33:01,951
You know, but for now, you got
something stronger than that-- my word.

626
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:04,760
And for that, it'll only cost
you a cup of coffee and a bialy.

627
00:33:04,777 --> 00:33:07,082
Come on.
I didn't feel like working out anyway.

628
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:18,331
Still haven't cashed it, I see.

629
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:21,171
Um, no,
I haven't really had a chance.

630
00:33:21,186 --> 00:33:23,280
Or haven't made the effort?

631
00:33:23,297 --> 00:33:25,350
Steel yourself, Betty.

632
00:33:25,365 --> 00:33:27,372
Think about what's
best for you.

633
00:33:27,387 --> 00:33:30,402
That's how we survive
in this business.

634
00:33:30,415 --> 00:33:33,012
Wilhelmina, you might want
to get down to the lobby,

635
00:33:33,025 --> 00:33:35,560
like, right now. It's Nico.

636
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:42,351
You, too. I think we might
actually see a live execution.

637
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,540
Open your eyes, people.

638
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:46,420
It's time to wake up.

639
00:33:46,435 --> 00:33:51,910
The "Must Mode" issue promotes the
unwarranted slaughter of innocent animals.

640
00:33:51,926 --> 00:33:54,452
And it is the fault
of one woman--

641
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,111
Wilhelmina Slater!

642
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,023
Nico, please,
you're causing a scene

643
00:33:58,035 --> 00:33:59,071
Great.

644
00:33:59,085 --> 00:34:02,880
Can't wait to see how Wilhelmina
Slater will handle this one.

645
00:34:04,188 --> 00:34:07,112
So sorry I'm late.

646
00:34:07,126 --> 00:34:09,150
Thank you for coming.

647
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,931
Ah, good to see you.

648
00:34:10,946 --> 00:34:13,991
Nico, step into the good light.

649
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:17,350
Thank you so much for coming,
ladies and gentlemen.

650
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:20,492
The "must" debate of 2007.

651
00:34:20,508 --> 00:34:23,592
Animal rights versus
fashion rights--

652
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:25,750
just who is right?

653
00:34:35,146 --> 00:34:36,780
Well, you're gonna have to wait

654
00:34:36,796 --> 00:34:41,083
until the "Must Mode" issue is on sale,
january 2007.

655
00:34:41,098 --> 00:34:44,253
Thank you so much
for coming. Good-bye.

656
00:34:47,947 --> 00:34:49,613
You win.

657
00:34:49,628 --> 00:34:51,870
I'll go to school in France,

658
00:34:51,885 --> 00:34:54,952
anywhere you want,
but I'm not going quietly.

659
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,723
- We'll talk upstairs.
- No!

660
00:34:56,736 --> 00:34:58,871
We'll talk now.

661
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:04,383
- I am your mother.
- Mother?

662
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:06,893
Then maybe you
should act like it.

663
00:35:06,907 --> 00:35:10,560
But I guess you don't have
a clue where to start.

664
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:12,552
I mean,

665
00:35:12,718 --> 00:35:15,993
have you ever even called
the senator "dad"?

666
00:35:16,007 --> 00:35:17,421
Never, huh?

667
00:35:17,438 --> 00:35:21,533
Is that armor so thick you can't
even feel anything anymore?

668
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:23,762
Was that the goal?

669
00:35:23,775 --> 00:35:26,160
Then congratulations.

670
00:35:26,178 --> 00:35:29,082
You're putting together
your "Must Mode" issue.

671
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:30,852
Things you must do.

672
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:33,292
You know what your number
one "must" should be?

673
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:35,920
Learning how to be a mother.

674
00:35:59,345 --> 00:36:01,652
I appreciate your kindness,

675
00:36:01,665 --> 00:36:03,523
but I can't cash that.

676
00:36:03,535 --> 00:36:05,742
Of course you can't.

677
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:09,320
Good luck with your
family situation, Betty.

678
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:12,593
They're never easy.

679
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:24,741
I just wanted to say good-bye.

680
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:27,892
I think you said
enough downstairs.

681
00:36:28,246 --> 00:36:30,630
Marc booked you a
flight for Paris.

682
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:32,281
You leave tonight at 9:00.

683
00:36:32,296 --> 00:36:34,350
I'll go back to your
place and pack my stuff.

684
00:36:34,368 --> 00:36:37,540
Nico, contrary to
what you might think,

685
00:36:37,557 --> 00:36:40,583
I do love you.

686
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:45,111
And I...
I only want what's best for you.

687
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,740
You want what's best for you.

688
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:00,281
All right. Yeah.

689
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:06,202
Hey.

690
00:37:08,307 --> 00:37:10,203
I had it.

691
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:15,071
Your lost watch.
You left it at my place last week.

692
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:17,770
Surprise. Right?

693
00:37:18,617 --> 00:37:21,940
You never even thought
to consider me.

694
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:25,811
I'm just a late
night call to you.

695
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:33,453
You need to find whatever it
is you're looking for, Daniel.

696
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:37,201
I just know now
that it's not me.

697
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:39,400
I'm--I'm sorry.

698
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:43,243
Amanda...

699
00:37:48,537 --> 00:37:49,572
Well?

700
00:37:49,586 --> 00:37:50,943
I checked it out. Nothing.

701
00:37:50,957 --> 00:37:53,323
The security cameras at the
cemetery didn't catch a thing.

702
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:55,640
No Fey Sommers hanging
out at her crypt.

703
00:37:55,656 --> 00:37:57,411
I saw her. I'm sure of it.

704
00:37:57,428 --> 00:38:00,982
How many times I gotta say this?
She's dead.

705
00:38:00,998 --> 00:38:02,942
You're going crazy,
you know that?

706
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:05,723
- Damn it, I saw her.
- Whatever, old man.

707
00:38:13,366 --> 00:38:15,252
Yeah, it's me.

708
00:38:15,268 --> 00:38:18,721
Remember that associate
I told you about?

709
00:38:18,735 --> 00:38:22,150
We need to have a long
conversation about him.

710
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:08,063
Dad.

711
00:39:09,817 --> 00:39:12,403
Do you remember when we
danced at my quinceañera,

712
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,780
and I broke my heel?

713
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:17,023
And I was so upset,
I wanted to run away,

714
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:18,613
but you wouldn't let me.

715
00:39:18,627 --> 00:39:21,821
You just held me tighter,
and we kept on dancing.

716
00:39:23,206 --> 00:39:25,970
You're our rock, dad.

717
00:39:28,438 --> 00:39:30,653
And I'm sorry for what I said

718
00:39:30,665 --> 00:39:33,001
and how I acted.

719
00:39:33,928 --> 00:39:37,240
I'm just gonna have to
forgive and forget, and...

720
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:40,750
whatever it is,
you don't owe us an explanation.

721
00:39:58,005 --> 00:40:00,700
Ramiro Vasquez.

722
00:40:02,345 --> 00:40:04,792
The man in the picture.

723
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:08,472
Your mother was married to him.

724
00:40:11,217 --> 00:40:12,783
Sit.

725
00:40:18,356 --> 00:40:22,353
He was a... a wealthy man.

726
00:40:22,656 --> 00:40:24,382
I was his chef.

727
00:40:24,397 --> 00:40:27,291
Whenever I would cook
food for them, I...

728
00:40:27,956 --> 00:40:31,070
I always hoped your
mother would look my way.

729
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:35,581
One night, uh, she did,

730
00:40:35,596 --> 00:40:40,360
and after that,
we fell in love.

731
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:42,343
Dad, if this is
too hard for you...

732
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:45,253
No, no, I...

733
00:40:45,707 --> 00:40:48,830
I owe this to both of you.

734
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:51,932
I could only sit back so long

735
00:40:51,947 --> 00:40:54,701
and let him treat
her the way he did.

736
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:58,921
I remember hearing her screaming,
her crying,

737
00:40:58,936 --> 00:41:00,202
when he hit her,

738
00:41:00,218 --> 00:41:05,062
and finally one night,
I couldn't take it anymore.

739
00:41:09,168 --> 00:41:11,620
Next thing I know,

740
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:13,833
he'd pulled a knife.

741
00:41:13,845 --> 00:41:15,963
So I...

742
00:41:17,048 --> 00:41:19,081
I hit him.

743
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:24,432
Just kept hitting him.

744
00:41:27,936 --> 00:41:30,563
After that, we ran...

745
00:41:31,126 --> 00:41:33,692
and I never looked back,

746
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:39,952
because I vowed I'd never take
my eyes off your mother again.

747
00:41:42,278 --> 00:41:47,420
I never applied for a green
card or amnesty because

748
00:41:47,657 --> 00:41:52,180
I was afraid they'd
send me back.

749
00:41:57,537 --> 00:42:02,230
I killed Ramiro Vasquez.
