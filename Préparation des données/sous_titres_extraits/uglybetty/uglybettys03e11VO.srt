1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,863
HER NAME IS JODIE PAPADAKIS,
AND SHE'S MY IDOL.

2
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:05,878
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING HER CAREER,
LIKE, FOREVER.

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:07,167
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I FINALLY GET TO MEET HER.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,034
WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS
RUNNING THE Y.E.T.I. PROGRAM,

5
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:12,000
I SCREAMED.
AAH!

6
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:13,690
AAH!
AAH!

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,167
I SHOULD PROBABLY BUY
MRS. BOWEN A GIFT.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,667
OKAY, LESS TALKING, MORE TAPING. HELLO.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,167
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I SET THIS PARTY FOR FRIDAY.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,768
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET
ALL OF THIS DONE IN THREE DAYS?

11
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:27,206
THAT'S WHAT YOUR FAMILY
IS FOR. DON'T WORRY.

12
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:29,862
WE'LL GET IT DONE. OH, DID I
TELL YOU THAT SHE STARTED OUT

13
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:31,828
AS A JUNIOR ASSISTANT
AT "THE NEW YORK OBSERVER"?

14
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:34,753
FIVE YEARS, SHE BECAME
THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.

15
00:00:34,753 --> 00:00:37,831
SHE'S A GENIUS. WOW. AND
YOU CHOSE US OVER HER?

16
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:40,175
NO, TONIGHT'S JUST A MIXER.
I GET TO SEE HER TOMORROW.

17
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:43,451
OH, BETTY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
IF, FOR THE REOPENING,

18
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:48,190
I HIRE SOMEONE TO DO MUSIC OR MAGIC OR SOMETHING
- MA, NO MAGIC.

19
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,456
I TRY SO HARD TO GET THE BRIDGE
AND TUNNEL OUT OF THIS FAMILY.

20
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,952
WOULD IT BE TOO WEIRD TO ASK HER
TO BE MY MENTOR RIGHT AWAY?

21
00:00:53,985 --> 00:00:56,885
BETTY, YOUR SISTER JUST ASKED
YOU A QUESTION. YEAH. HELLO?

22
00:00:56,918 --> 00:00:58,386
OH, RIGHT. YES.

23
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:01,052
DO YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
WOULD BE FUN? GIFT BAGS.

24
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:03,319
I CAN'T AFFORD GIFT BAGS.

25
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:06,052
I SPENT ALL MY MONEY
ON THIS BEAUTIFUL SIGN

26
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:08,352
AND THIS NEW MERCH.

27
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:10,386
THAT'S SHORT FOR "MERCHANDISE."

28
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,552
HILDA,
IT WON'T COST YOU A THING.

29
00:01:13,586 --> 00:01:16,050
"MODE" GETS SAMPLES
ALL THE TIME.

30
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,612
I CAN JUST BRING SOME HOME
TOMORROW. HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

31
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:20,175
OH!
OH!

32
00:01:20,175 --> 00:01:25,319
HILDA'S BEAUTILITIES PLUS. OH,
MY GOD! THIS IS SO EXCITING.

33
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:28,319
THIS PARTY IS GONNA BE LIKE
MY VERY OWN BROADWAY OPENING.

34
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:30,786
YEAH, IT'S LIKE
"SPRING AWAKENING," "AVENUE Q."

35
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:33,052
AND "SOUTH PACIFIC"
ALL ROLLED INTO ONE.

36
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:35,219
GRANDPA, NICE.

37
00:01:35,252 --> 00:01:37,219
HEY, I KEEP UP.

38
00:01:38,238 --> 00:01:39,918
HEY, SHOULDN'T THAT
FACE OUTWARD?

39
00:01:41,112 --> 00:01:42,352
<i>PAPI.
AY, DIOS MO.</i>

40
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:44,050
I WASN'T DONE.

41
00:01:51,586 --> 00:01:52,925
THERE IS
NO OTHER WAY TO SPIN IT.

42
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:54,940
"ELLE" KICKED OUR BUTTS
LAST MONTH.

43
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,675
WAS IT CLASSY TO SHOW
SARAH SILVERMAN ON THE TOILET?

44
00:01:57,675 --> 00:02:00,300
NO. BUT THEIR NUMBERS WERE
WAY UP, AND A WIN IS A WIN.

45
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,050
SO TRASHY. THAT NEVER WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED AT "ELLE" ON MY WATCH.

46
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,597
WEREN'T YOU AN INTERN?
SHUT UP.

47
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:08,425
GUYS. ANYWAY, WE ARE
NOT GONNA LOSE AGAIN.

48
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:10,940
IF WE DO, ONE OF YOU DIES.

49
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:12,956
I HAVE SOMETHING BIG
PLANNED FOR APRIL.

50
00:02:12,956 --> 00:02:17,488
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT JUST YET. TREAT
EVERYTHING WE DISCUSS IN HERE AS PROPRIETARY.

51
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:20,503
THOSE COWS AT "ELLE" WOULD LOVE TO
KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP TO. ON THE FLIP SIDE,

52
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:22,863
IF ANY OF YOU HEAR ANYTHING
ABOUT THEM,

53
00:02:22,863 --> 00:02:25,050
THERE IS A VERY NICE
BOTTLE OF WINE IN IT FOR YOU.

54
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,269
AND MAYBE YOU'LL LIVE
TO SEE ANOTHER DAY.

55
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:28,862
NOW GET BACK TO WORK.

56
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:34,425
I LOVE THE WHOLE
GOOD COP/BAD COP THING

57
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:35,612
YOU TWO HAVE GOING.

58
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:36,613
AH, IT'S NOT REALLY A THING.

59
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:38,706
IT'S MORE LIKE I'M NICE,
SHE'S NOT.

60
00:02:38,956 --> 00:02:43,425
MM. CAN I HELP IT IF MY BALLS ARE BIGGER
THAN HIS? GOD, I LOVE E THIS WOMAN.

61
00:02:44,737 --> 00:02:45,800
YEAH.

62
00:02:46,188 --> 00:02:48,300
WILL I SEE YOU AT MY PARTY
ON FRIDAY?

63
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,347
I BUMPED GRAYDON CARTER FOR YOU.
I WOULDN'T MISS IT FOR THE WORLD.

64
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:54,128
MOLLY HAS A SCHOOL PAGEANT
THAT NIGHT,

65
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:55,878
BUT I PLAN
ON TALKING HER OUT OF IT.

66
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,128
OH, MOLLY'S COMING?

67
00:02:59,362 --> 00:02:59,999
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

68
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:03,612
WELL, OF COURSE.
SHE'S YOUR FIANCE.

69
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:07,346
I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO BUMP
ANNA WINTOUR OFF THE GUEST LIST,

70
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:08,628
BUT, YOU KNOW,
SERVES HER RIGHT.

71
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:11,941
I THINK SHE STOLE A PAIR OF
SUNGLASSES FROM ME LAST YEAR.

72
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,769
GOOD.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

73
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:20,175
THIS IS THE RECENTLY UNEARTHED
HALSTON ORIGINAL

74
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:21,362
FROM THE FIREWORKS COLLECTION.

75
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:23,737
WOW. THAT IS INCREDIBLE.

76
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,362
I FOUND
THIS PRIVATE COLLECTOR

77
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:27,128
WHO'S GONNA LOAN IT TO US
FOR ONE SHOOT.

78
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:29,050
KEIRA KNIGHTLEY
WILL DO OUR COVER

79
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,441
<i>IF SHE CAN WEAR THIS DRESS.
SHUT UP!</i>

80
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:34,613
I MEAN, ON THAT COVER ALONE,
WE GOT 30 MORE PAGES OF AD BUYS.

81
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:38,128
THIS COULD REALLY BE A BIG GAME
CHANGER FOR US. SUCK ON THAT, "ELLE."

82
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:41,316
* GO, DANIEL, GO, DANIEL
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT.

83
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:42,988
I...
I NEED YOU TO ARRANGE

84
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:45,487
TO PICK THIS UP FROM
THE COLLECTOR'S LOFT TOMORROW.

85
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:49,425
HERE'S THE INFO. PLEASE, BETTY,
KEEP IT HUSH-HUSH.

86
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:51,738
I FEEL LIKE
AN INTERNATIONAL SPY.

87
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:55,362
EXCEPT REAL SPIES
DON'T ANNOUNCE THEY'RE SPIES.

88
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:59,550
DANIEL, WOULD YOU MIND
STEPPING INTO MY OFFICE?

89
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,612
I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

90
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,316
I HAVE SOME FRIENDS
HERE IN SECURITY.

91
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,456
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU AND MOLLY
WERE SO CLOSE.

92
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:14,363
YOU'RE AWFUL.

93
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:17,800
PERHAPS IN THE PAST,
BUT NOT THIS TIME.

94
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,425
LOOK, THIS IS THE ONLY COPY.
IT'S YOURS.

95
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:26,159
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

96
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:26,988
NOTHING.

97
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:30,550
THIS IS A PERSONAL MATTER.

98
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,050
I UNDERSTAND.

99
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,737
SHE'S ENGAGED TO YOUR FRIEND,
OUR-OUR COLLEAGUE.

100
00:04:34,737 --> 00:04:35,566
LOOK, I'M SURE

101
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,566
YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS,

102
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:41,175
BUT SOME THINGS
ARE WORTH THE RISK.

103
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,999
WE BOTH KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO FIND LOVE.

104
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:46,753
IT'S-IT'S NOT LOVE.

105
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,999
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
OR HOW SHE FEELS.

106
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,966
<i>YOU KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.</i>

107
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:55,659
AND IT LOOKS LIKE MOLLY
MIGHT BE ON THE SAME PAGE.

108
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,925
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF

109
00:04:56,925 --> 00:04:58,988
TO SEE WHETHER
THERE'S ANYTHING THERE?

110
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:04,175
YOU GAVE HIM THE DVD?

111
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:06,503
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
WITH YOU, WOMAN?

112
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:08,300
AND DON'T SAY, "NOT
EVERYTHING'S A SCHEME, MARC,"

113
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,999
BECAUSE I WILL SLAP YOU.

114
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:11,878
NOT EVERYTHING IS A SCHEME,
MARC.

115
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,999
OKAY, I THINK WE BOTH KNOW THAT I'M NOT GOING
TO SLAP YOU. SOMETIMES HONESTY WORKS, TOO.

116
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:17,988
OH, I GET IT.
SO HONESTY'S THE SCHEME.

117
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:20,613
THE OLD HONESTY SCHEME.
YEAH! THAT'S A CLASSIC.

118
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:22,253
NO, NO, NO. THIS IS
ONE OF THOSE RARE TIMES

119
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:24,550
WHERE WHAT DANIEL WANTS
AND WHAT I WANT INTERSECT.

120
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,425
NOW IF DANIEL AND MOLLY
END UP TOGETHER,

121
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:29,488
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE...
CONNOR?

122
00:05:29,488 --> 00:05:30,999
HEARTBROKEN.

123
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,925
AND THEN YOU'LL BE THERE
TO PICK UP THE PIECES.

124
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:34,737
YOU KNOW ME.
I'M VERY NURTURING.

125
00:05:34,737 --> 00:05:39,425
YEAH, VERY NUR-
VERY, VERY NURTURING.

126
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,159
CHRISTINA.

127
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:44,925
"BETTY SUAREZ,
YOUNG EDITOR IN TRAINING." OH.

128
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:46,987
THIS IS SO SWEET.
OH, I WANTED YOU TO HAVE

129
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:49,987
SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR YOUR FIRST DAY.

130
00:05:49,987 --> 00:05:52,191
JUST DON'T YOU FORGET ABOUT ME
WHEN YOU'RE A BIG STAR

131
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:54,706
AND I'M STILL STUCK HERE
IN MY TAILOR'S DUNGEON.

132
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:57,738
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE
FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF.

133
00:05:57,738 --> 00:06:00,987
WELL, I'VE BEEN RELINING
WILHELMINA'S DRESS

134
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:03,113
FOR HER SUPER ELITE
COCKTAIL PARTY,

135
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,675
EVEN THOUGH THE OLD ONE WAS
PERFECTLY GOOD.

136
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:08,425
AND ALL THIS EXTRA BENDING
DOWN'S MAKING ME FEEL DIZZY

137
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:10,675
BECAUSE I'M CARRYING
HER LITTLE RODENT,

138
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:12,862
WHICH SEEMS TO BE
KICKING ME IN THE GUT

139
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:14,425
EVERY FIVE SECONDS TODAY.

140
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,800
AND THE INTERNET HAS GONE DOWN.

141
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:21,566
SORRY.

142
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:25,363
IT'S ALL MY HORMONES.
JUST...

143
00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:28,300
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

144
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,238
HEY, HEY. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
CHEER YOU UP? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

145
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:32,816
COME TO HILDA'S.

146
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:36,238
SHE'S HAVING THIS HUGE REOPENING
OF HER SALON. IT'LL BE FUN.

147
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:39,316
YEAH, THAT DOES SOUND LIKE FUN.
I LIKE YOUR SISTER.

148
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:43,175
SHE SAYS WHAT'S ON HER MIND,
AYE? AND SHE DRINKS.

149
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,113
I USED TO DRINK.

150
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:50,488
OH, CHRISTINA, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY?

151
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:52,363
NO, I'M FINE. I D-
I DO THIS ALL DAY LONG.

152
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:54,925
OH. OOH.

153
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,628
NOW GO. GO!

154
00:06:56,628 --> 00:06:58,612
ARE YOU SURE?
I'M POSITIVE. GO. GO.

155
00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:01,362
UH, OKAY, BUT YOU'LL CALL ME
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING?

156
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:02,999
YES! NOW GO AND HURRY UP.

157
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,847
I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THIS.

158
00:07:04,847 --> 00:07:09,425
I AM. I AM SO EXCITED.
CHRISTINA, THIS COULD BE

159
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:11,050
THE BEGINNING
OF THE REST OF MY LIFE.

160
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,675
WELCOME TO THE FUNERAL.

161
00:07:13,675 --> 00:07:16,863
THE MAGAZINE BUSINESS IS DYING.

162
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:17,999
DYING.

163
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:20,825
DOES THAT
FRIGHTEN YOU? IT SHOULD.

164
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,025
IT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME.

165
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:25,878
SO... WHAT DO YOU DO?

166
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,825
DO YOU GIVE UP

167
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:30,058
OR DO YOU TOUGHEN UP?

168
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:32,624
WHEN I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK

169
00:07:32,658 --> 00:07:35,825
WITH MY CURLY HAIR
AND THIS VOICE,

170
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:39,459
DO YOU THINK
ANYONE TOOK ME SERIOUSLY?

171
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:40,758
NO.

172
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,691
THEY MOCKED ME.

173
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:44,550
SO FROM THEN ON...
I LOVE HER.

174
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,503
DID YOU EAT ONIONS FOR LUNCH? I MADE DAMN SURE
- DO I HEAR TALKING?

175
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:52,753
<i>HOW CAN THAT POSSIBLY BE?
I'M TALKING.</i>

176
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:53,800
GOOD. THANK YOU.

177
00:07:54,363 --> 00:07:56,463
NOW LET'S GET STARTED.

178
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:59,362
UH, MARC ST. JAMES,
RAISE YOUR HAND.

179
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:02,191
TELL ME THE NAME AND MAGAZINE

180
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,456
OF FIVE OF THE PEOPLE
IN THIS ROOM. GO.

181
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,488
UH... HEATHER JACKSON,
"GOURMET,"

182
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,800
TOM BUCKLEY,

183
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,378
ERIC WEST, "HARPER'S,"

184
00:08:10,378 --> 00:08:13,362
UH, EVIE F-FOSTER, "OUT"

185
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:16,999
AND RITA THOMPSON,
"ROLLING STONE."

186
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:18,675
EXCELLENT.

187
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:20,175
BETTY SUAREZ.
YES.

188
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:22,535
FIVE PEOPLE-NAME AND MAGAZINE.

189
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:32,425
UM... WELL, I KNOW MARC.
HE WORKS WITH ME AT "MODE."

190
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:34,300
HI, MARC.
WHO ARE YOU?

191
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,831
HE'S JUST KIDDING. DIDN'T
YOU MEET ANYONE AT THE MIXER?

192
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:41,363
OH, I WASN'T AT THE MIXER.
I HAD A FAMILY OBLIGATION.

193
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:44,488
AND SINCE IT WAS JUST CASUAL,
I SKIPPED IT.

194
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:46,362
WHO ELSE MISSED THE EVENT
LAST NIGHT?

195
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:50,550
ANYONE ELSE HAVE A FAMILY
OBLIGATION, A SICK HAMSTER?

196
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,675
NO?

197
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,362
GOOD. BECAUSE LAST NIGHT
WASN'T CASUAL.

198
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:58,300
LAST NIGHT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY

199
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,363
FOR YOU TO LEARN SOMETHING

200
00:08:59,363 --> 00:09:01,456
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE COLLEAGUES,

201
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:05,425
BUT I GUESS THAT WASN'T
IMPORTANT TO MS. SUAREZ.

202
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:08,175
IT IS.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

203
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:09,425
CAN I CHANGE SEATS?

204
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:12,113
NO. FIRST ASSIGNMENT-
CONTACTS-

205
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:13,863
BY THIS TIME NEXT WEEK,

206
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:17,550
I WANT EVERYONE IN HERE
TO HAVE 40 NEW ONES.

207
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,488
AND FAMILY DOESN'T COUNT.

208
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:23,237
YOU HAVE TO MAKE
A LOT OF TOUGH CHOICES

209
00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:24,706
IN THIS BUSINESS.

210
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:26,999
IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT,

211
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:30,440
THEN DON'T PLAN ON COMING BACK.

216
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:55,300
THANKS, BETTY.

217
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:00,563
YOU'RE DOING Y.E.T.I.

218
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:02,550
HUH? OH, UH, YEAH.

219
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,425
MY FRIEND JODIE'S
RUNNING THAT THIS YEAR.

220
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:06,300
SHE'S REALLY TERRIFIC.

221
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,800
YEAH. YEAH, SHE'S, UH, GREAT.

222
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,472
SHE CAN BE PRETTY TOUGH,
THOUGH.

223
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:12,863
YEAH, WELL...

224
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:18,488
SHE WAS A LITTLE UNFAIR TO ME...
YESTERDAY, 'CAUSE,

225
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:20,878
YOU KNOW, I SHOWED UP
TO CLASS COMPLETELY PREPARED,

226
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:22,925
AND THEN SHE CALLED ME OUT

227
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:24,988
'CAUSE I DIDN'T GO
TO SOME SILLY NETWORKING THING.

228
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:27,566
WELL, NETWORKING IS
ONE OF THOSE ANNOYING THINGS,

229
00:10:27,566 --> 00:10:29,128
BUT IF YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT YOUR CAREER,

230
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,754
IT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DO.

231
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,737
WELL, I HAD A FAMILY THING,
YOU KNOW?

232
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:35,204
I COULDN'T DISAPPOINT THEM.

233
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:38,441
I CANNOT TELL YOU
HOW MANY THINGS I'VE HAD TO MISS

234
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:39,675
BECAUSE OF MY JOB.

235
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:41,175
YOU JUST ASK MOLLY.

236
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:43,988
YEAH, WELL,
IT MIGHT NOT MATTER ANYWAY.

237
00:10:43,988 --> 00:10:45,487
SHE TOLD ME
THAT IF I CAN'T GET

238
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:48,175
40 NEW CONTACTS
BY NEXT CLASS,

239
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:49,999
NOT TO COME BACK.

240
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:50,518
ALL RIGHT, BETTY,

241
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:52,987
YOU DO WHAT I DID
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

242
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:53,863
YOU FIND SOMEBODY

243
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:55,816
WHO'S REALLY GOOD
AT THE SUPERFICIAL STUFF

244
00:10:55,816 --> 00:10:57,437
AND YOU DO WHAT THEY DO.

245
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,613
MY ANSWER IS NUH-OH.

246
00:11:05,613 --> 00:11:07,628
OH, MARC, COME ON. PLEASE.
I'M SO DESPERATE.

247
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:09,737
OKAY. GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON
WHY I SHOULD DO THIS.

248
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,338
UM, WELL, MAYBE BECAUSE
IF I HADN'T STEPPED ASIDE,

249
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,800
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
INTO Y.E.T.I. TO BEGIN WITH.

250
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,737
OH-HO! YOU'RE GONNA BRING UP
THAT OLD CHESTNUT AGAIN. FINE.

251
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,769
YOU DO NOT GET
TO PLAY THIS CARD AGAIN. OKAY?

252
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:23,050
MEET ME AND AMANDA AFTER WORK.
WE'LL TAKE YOU TO SWILL.

253
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,440
EVERYONE YOU NEED TO MEET
WILL BE THERE.

254
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,738
GREAT. OH, WAIT.
NO, MARC, I CAN'T DO THAT.

255
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:31,565
I PROMISED MY SISTER I'D HELP
- BUP, BUP, BUP, BUP, BUP. DON'T CARE.

256
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,050
YOU GOT ME TONIGHT
OR NOT AT ALL.

257
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,737
HILDA, HI.

258
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,316
LOOK, I'M SO SORRY,

259
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:43,628
BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO HELP OUT TONIGHT.

260
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:46,390
OH, BETTY, WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO DO THESE GIFT BAGS TOGETHER.

261
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,331
I KNOW, AND-AND WE STILL ARE,
JUST TOMORROW.

262
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:50,894
SEE, IF I DON'T DO
THIS Y.E.T.I. THING TONIGHT,

263
00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:53,175
THEY'RE GONNA KICK ME OUT.

264
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:56,925
FINE. I GET IT.
WE'LL DO IT TOMORROW. BYE.

265
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,362
BYE.

266
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:00,112
SWEETIE...

267
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,706
IF BETTY HAD A CHOICE,
YOU KNOW SHE'D BE HERE.

268
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,766
YEAH.
COME ON. WE GOT WORK TO DO.

269
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:06,940
ALL RIGHT.

270
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,643
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

271
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,910
UH, EXCUSE ME A SECOND. MOLLY.

272
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,816
DANIEL.
HEY.

273
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:16,800
HI.

274
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:20,941
SO DID THE DRESS WORK OUT?

275
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,175
OH, YEAH. IT WAS GREAT.

276
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,363
YOU KNOW, IT WAS VERY,
UH, GLAMOROUS.

277
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:27,175
ACTUALLY, I JUST CAME
TO RETURN IT, SO...

278
00:12:27,406 --> 00:12:28,300
UM...

279
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,737
ALL RIGHT. UM, AWESOME.

280
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,925
YOU KNOW, I-
DANIEL, CAN WE-

281
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:36,238
I... NO, YOU GO.
GO AHEAD.

282
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,925
UH...

283
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:42,300
WE JUST-WE NEVER...

284
00:12:42,547 --> 00:12:44,754
GOT A CHANCE
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

285
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:47,050
YOU KNOW, IN THE CLOSET.

286
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,300
YEAH.

287
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:52,425
I JUST-I WANTED
TO TELL YOU THAT-

288
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:55,050
HEY, BABE.
HEY.

289
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,862
READY FOR LUNCH?
MM-HMM.

290
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,050
THANKS FOR KEEPING HER COMPANY,
MATE.

291
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,066
BYE.

292
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,566
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

293
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:13,910
YOU KNOW, I-I'VE BEEN
WITH A MILLION WOMEN.

294
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,300
EVERY TIME I'M AROUND HER,
IT'S LIKE...

295
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,941
I JUST ACT LIKE
A STUPID TEENAGER.

296
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:20,800
BECAUSE YOU CARE FOR HER.

297
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,675
GOD, I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

298
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:25,999
YES, BUT YOU'RE ALSO HUMAN.

299
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:28,062
YOU KNOW,
I- I SWEAR MOLLY WAS

300
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:29,719
JUST ABOUT TO SAY
SOMETHING IMPORTANT,

301
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,175
AND, OF COURSE, THAT'S WHEN
CONNOR CAME UP AND KISSED HER.

302
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:37,238
WELL, MAYBE "MODE'S" NOT
THE PLACE FOR THAT CONVERSATION.

303
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:39,613
YEAH,
BUT WHAT CHOICE I HAVE?

304
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:42,769
WELL, YOU'RE BOTH COMING
TO MY PARTY ON FRIDAY.

305
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:45,581
KNOWING CONNOR,
HE'LL BE WORKING THE ROOM.

306
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:48,129
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU
TO FINISH YOUR CONVERSATION,

307
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,362
UNINTERRUPTED.

308
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,129
HMM.

309
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:59,175
HERE'S MY CARD. M-MAYBE
WE'LL DO BUSINESS SOMEDAY.

310
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:01,112
UH, "THE GORGEOUS GOURMET"-

311
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:02,425
THAT IS CATCHY.
OH.

312
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,941
HERE'S MINE.
THANKS.

313
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:06,112
ALL RIGHT, TALK TO YOU LATER.
OKAY.

314
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:08,941
WELL? THAT WASN'T SO-

315
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:10,816
TERRIBLE.
HORRIBLE.

316
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,191
COULD NOT HAVE GONE WORSE.

317
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:14,832
YOU SPENT
22 MINUTES AND 47 SECONDS

318
00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:16,487
TALKING TO A CATERER.
A CATERER.

319
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:19,441
A CATERER!
HE WAS INTERESTING.

320
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,831
USELESS!

321
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:23,378
THE POINT OF NETWORKING
IS TO GATHER INFORMATION

322
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:26,175
TO ADVANCE YOUR CAREER.

323
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:27,737
WATCH AND LEARN.

324
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,785
STEP ONE-FORGE A BOND...

325
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:35,425
YOUR NAME, WHERE YOU WORK
AND ONE MEMORABLE FACT.

326
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:38,332
I'M MARC ST. JAMES.
I WORK FOR WILHELMINA SLATER.

327
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:40,612
I ONCE HAD A THREESOME
WITH JON HAMM AND MIA HAMM.

328
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:42,999
I CALLED IT
THE NIGHT OF THE HAMM SANDWICH.

329
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:46,050
WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

330
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,112
IT'S MEMORABLE.
BUT IT'S A LIE.

331
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:50,457
OR IS IT?
IT IS.

332
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,425
STEP TWO-
GATHERING INFORMATION...

333
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,769
<i>IN ORDER TO GET INFO, YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE INFO.</i>

334
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:59,612
DO YOU KNOW WHY HEIDI KLUM
NEVER WEARS OPEN-TOED SHOES?

335
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:02,925
THE TRICK IS
TO MAKE IT SOUND JUICY

336
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:04,765
BUT REALLY MEAN NOTHING.

337
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:07,550
12 LITTLE PIGGIES.
OH, YEAH. IT'S DISGUSTING.

338
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,300
I'M NOT EVEN KIDDING
ABOUT THAT.

339
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,425
SO WHAT WERE YOU SAYING ABOUT
NEXT MONTH'S COVER MODEL?

340
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:14,690
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
STEP THREE-THE EXIT STRATEGY.

341
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,999
GET IN, GET INFO, GET OUT.

342
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,909
SEE,
I- I DON'T LIKE TO BE RUDE.

343
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:21,800
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU
JUST STOP SOMEONE

344
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,237
IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION WITHOUT HURTING THEIR
- OH.

345
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:26,503
BETTY, COULD YOU
JUST HOLD ON ONE SEC?

346
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,050
<i>* WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO</i>

347
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,175
OH. OKAY, I GET IT.

348
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:33,691
OKAY, AMANDA, I GET IT.

349
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,175
AMANDA?

350
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:36,753
SHE'S NOT COMING BACK,

351
00:15:36,753 --> 00:15:39,269
AND NEITHER AM I. I'VE GIVEN YOU
ALL I HAVE TO GIVE.

352
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:41,550
NO, MARC, DON'T GO.
I'M NOT READY.

353
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,300
YES, YOU ARE.

354
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,425
YOU'RE A MEAN, NOT-SO-LEAN,
CONTACT-GETTIN' MACHINE.

355
00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:49,503
YOU'RE THE TERMINATOR.

356
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,675
YOU'RE THE BETTY-NATOR.

357
00:15:54,312 --> 00:15:55,737
GO GET 'EM.

358
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,957
<i>OKAY, MEMORABLE FACT.
I KNOW A MURDERER.</i>

359
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:55,747


360
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,675
THANK YOU.

361
00:16:22,675 --> 00:16:24,379
HERE'S MINE.

362
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:30,738
<i>GIVE INFO THAT SOUNDS JUICY
BUT MEANS NOTHING.</i>

363
00:16:30,738 --> 00:16:33,550
OH, WE TOTALLY HIRED THAT WRITER
TO GO TO MILAN.

364
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,425
JUST FYI, HE HAS
A PAY-PER-VIEW PROBLEM.

365
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:38,050
PORN.

366
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:36,435


367
00:16:40,188 --> 00:16:43,925
AND WHAT DESIGNER DID YOU SAY
YOU'LL BE FEATURING THIS MONTH?

368
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:49,988
THAT IS VERY INTERESTING.

369
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:43,935


370
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,597
<i>GET INFO, GET OUT.</i>

371
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:59,581
OH. ACTUALLY, COULD YOU
EXCUSE ME JUST ONE SECOND?

372
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,613
YOU WERE VERY INTERESTING.

373
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:07,534
37, 38, 39.
SHOOT. ONE MORE.

374
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,175
HI. BETTY SUAREZ.

375
00:17:12,175 --> 00:17:15,191
YOU ARE?
EXHAUSTED. I HATE NETWORKING.

376
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:16,972
OH, MY GOD. ME, TOO.

377
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:19,112
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS OKAY
TO ADMIT THAT.

378
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:20,050
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,

379
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,628
THE NETWORKING POLICE ARE
GONNA COME AND ARREST US?

380
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:26,238
YEAH, AND, LIKE, CHARGE US
WITH "FAILURE TO CHITCHAT"?

381
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:27,518
I JUST DON'T SEE

382
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:30,143
HOW KNOWING THAT
THAT GUY IS INTO S&M

383
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:32,456
IS GOING TO HELP MY CAREER.

384
00:17:32,456 --> 00:17:35,644
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THAT GUY
ISN'T IN PUBLISHING.

385
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:37,238
HE'S A DENTIST.

386
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:38,300
EW.

387
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:43,113
I'M TERI, AND I'M NOT
DOING THIS TO NETWORK.

388
00:17:43,113 --> 00:17:44,441
YOU JUST SEEM REALLY NICE.

389
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:45,363
OH.

390
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:46,425
THANKS.

391
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:49,999
"ELLE."

392
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:53,128
"MODE," "ELLE."
HERE WE GO.

393
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,487
I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD BE
USING EACH OTHER

394
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:56,800
TO GET INFORMATION.

395
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,862
YEAH. NO.

396
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:03,456
I MEAN, WE COULD JUST TALK,
YOU KNOW, LIKE, UH, HUMANS.

397
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,999
BLUE BRACES. BOLD.

398
00:18:07,312 --> 00:18:09,425
I LIKE YOUR PINK STRIPE.
IT'S COOL.

399
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:11,050
THANKS.

400
00:18:11,738 --> 00:18:12,925
I MEAN, IT WAS 20 MINUTES.

401
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,050
THAT'S NOT TOO LONG TO SPEND
ON A CATERER, RIGHT?

402
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,238
HELL, NO. PLUS,
GORGEOUS GOURMET TOTALLY ROCKS.

403
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:20,999
THEY'RE DOING OUR HOLIDAY PARTY
THIS YEAR.

404
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:24,488
OH... NO.

405
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,832
UH, I'M GONNA GO
CLEAN THAT UP.

406
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:31,300
THIS ISN'T MY EXIT STRATEGY,
BY THE WAY.

407
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,613
DIDN'T THINK IT WAS. YOU KNOW,
AFTER ALL THIS FAKE NETWORKING,

408
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,628
IT'S NICE TO MEET SOMEONE
IN THE MAGAZINE INDUSTRY

409
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:39,128
WHO'S REAL.
YEAH. SAME HERE.

410
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,425
I'LL BE BACK.

411
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:56,659
HOLD THE PRESSES!

412
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:58,800
I LOVE YOUR ENERGY, BETTY,
BUT NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

413
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,362
I JUST FOUND OUT "ELLE" IS
DOING THEIR CENTER SPREAD

414
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:02,925
IN THE VENICE CANALS,
JUST LIKE WE WERE.

415
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:07,550
SO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD.
I KNOW. I HEARD. BUT GET THIS-

416
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,941
"ELLE" BOOKED JESSICA STAM
FOR THEIR COVER SHOOT.

417
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,659
SHE JUST BROKE UP
WITH HER ITALIAN BOYFRIEND

418
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:13,362
AND REFUSES TO GO TO ITALY,

419
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:18,175
SO THEY'RE MOVING THE WHOLE SHOOT TO
PARIS. SO VENICE IS BACK ON. NICE WORK!

420
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:19,550
YOU JUST EARNED YOURSELF
A BOTTLE OF WINE.

421
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:24,550
WHOO-HOO! I GUESS I'LL BE PICKING THAT UP FOR
MYSELF? UH, YES, BUT I WILL BE VERY GENEROUS.

422
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,863
HMM. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW,
THIS WHOLE NETWORKING THING

423
00:19:27,863 --> 00:19:29,175
IS REALLY PAYING OFF FOR ME.

424
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:31,800
THE ONLY WAY I KNEW
ABOUT JESSICA STAM IS TERI,

425
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,863
MY NEW BUSINESS CONTACT
WHO WORKS AT "ELLE."

426
00:19:33,863 --> 00:19:37,862
I MET HER LAST NIGHT. SHE GAVE ME THE WHOLE INSIDE
SCOOP. YEAH? WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP FOR THAT, HMM?

427
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:40,347
THAT PETER FRANCIS IS
HANDS-Y WITH THE MODELS.

428
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:44,862
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. I KNOW. OH, HEY,
DANIEL, IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE,

429
00:19:44,862 --> 00:19:46,925
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD
JUST CUT OUT EARLY TONIGHT.

430
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:50,112
MY SISTER'S GOT A THING. UH,
ACTUALLY, THERE IS SOMETHING.

431
00:19:50,112 --> 00:19:51,519
UH, I DON'T MEAN
TO SOUND NEUROTIC,

432
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,816
BUT IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT

433
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,237
IF YOU PICKED UP
THE HALSTON DRESS

434
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:59,363
RATHER THAN SENDING A MESSENGER.
IT'S GONNA BE READY AT 5:00. OH. UM...

435
00:19:59,363 --> 00:20:01,550
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

436
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,612
NO.

437
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:04,519
NO PROBLEM.

438
00:20:09,078 --> 00:20:12,550
<i>PAPI, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR PICKING UP THESE SAMPLES.</i>

439
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,925
TELL HILDA I WILL BEHE
AS SOON AS I CAN.

440
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:18,487
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU CAN'T HAVE SOMEONE ELSE

441
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:20,316
DO THIS SUPER SECRET TASK.

442
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:24,190
BECAUSE DANIEL ONLY TRUSTS ME
TO DO IT, AND, DAD,

443
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,050
I SWEAR, IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT,
I WOULDN'T BE DOING IT.

444
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,738
WELL, YOUR SISTER WAS
COUNTING ON YOU.

445
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:31,472
YOU KNOW, THE LOCAL PAPER'S
COMING TO DO A FEATURE ON HER.

446
00:20:31,472 --> 00:20:36,315
SHE'S A NERVOUS WRECK. OH, SHE'S GONNA
BE SO GREAT. SHE'S SO GOOD WITH PEOPLE.

447
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:37,753
HEY, LISTEN. I COULD ALWAYS
COME AROUND EARLY AND HELP,

448
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:41,999
IF YOU-IF YOU WANT. OH! CHRISTINA
WILL COME AND HELP. PERFECT.

449
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:42,566
BETTY, ARE YOU GETTING

450
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:45,050
HOW MUCH THIS RELAUNCH PARTY
MEANS TO HILDA?

451
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:50,565
SHE'S PUTTING EVERYTHING INTO IT. DAD, I GET
IT, AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD. I WILL BE THERE.

452
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:52,300
NOW I REALLY
HAVE TO GET GOING.

453
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,988
CHRISTINA'S GONNA HELP YOU
FINISH IN HERE,

454
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:58,691
AND I WILL SEE YOU SOON. OKAY. YEAH.

455
00:21:04,737 --> 00:21:06,628
PERFECT. THANK YOU.

456
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:08,925
OH, DONE.

457
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:10,503
WOW. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE

458
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,175
WHAT THIS PLACE IS
GONNA LOOK LIKE TONIGHT-

459
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:16,237
THE FOOD, THE DRINKS,
THE NEW YORK MEDIA ELITE.

460
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,488
IS IT AS MAGICAL
AS IT SOUNDS?

461
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,687
YES, YES, YES.

462
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,425
NOW THE WHOLE IDEA IS

463
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:25,253
TO GIVE DANIEL AND MOLLY
SOME TIME ALONE,

464
00:21:25,253 --> 00:21:28,550
SO FIRST, I'LL PULL CONNOR ASIDE
TO MEET ARIANNA HUFFINGTON.

465
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,550
OH! OH, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO MEET HER.

466
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,362
MM. WELL, STOP HINTING, MARC.
YOU'RE NOT INVITED.

467
00:21:34,362 --> 00:21:37,300
NOW WHILE CONNOR IS OCCUPIED
WITH ARIANNA,

468
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,440
DANIEL WILL SWOOP IN,

469
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,488
TAKE MOLLY INTO THE BEDROOM
SO THEY CAN TALK.

470
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:43,050
JUICY COUTURE.

471
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,425
AND THEN YOU WALK IN WITH CONNOR
AND SEE DANIEL ON TOP OF MOLLY.

472
00:21:45,425 --> 00:21:48,378
NO, NO, NO. MARC, I TOLD YOU.
THIS IS NOT A PLAN.

473
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:50,238
OKAY, I AM
JUST NOT GETTING THIS.

474
00:21:50,238 --> 00:21:54,800
I- I-I-MAYBE I NEED
TO BE HERE TO SEE IT.

475
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,129
MAYBE NOT.

476
00:22:00,063 --> 00:22:01,425
HEY, HEY, HEY.

477
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:02,550
OH, I TELL YOU, HILDA,

478
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,050
THIS IS A GREAT SETUP
YOU'VE GOT GOING HERE.

479
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,191
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN SHOP,
YOU CAN GET YOUR HAIR CUT.

480
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:09,457
THROW IN A FOOD COURT,
I WOULD NEVER LEAVE.

481
00:22:10,734 --> 00:22:11,300
NO, BUT, LISTEN,

482
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,894
YOU MUST BE REALLY PROUD
OF YOURSELF, THOUGH.

483
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,050
I AM. I AM.
I'VE SCREWED UP A LOT,

484
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,987
AND I FINALLY FEEL LIKE
I'M GETTING MY ACT TOGETHER.

485
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:22,425
THIS IS THE BIGGEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

486
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,550
OH!
NOT THAT MY SISTER'S NOTICED.

487
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,238
OH, NO. I THINK SHE HAS. SHE'S
JUST BEEN REALLY BUSY LATELY.

488
00:22:28,238 --> 00:22:31,675
YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN'T LIVE
YOUR WHOLE LIFE FOR WORK.

489
00:22:31,675 --> 00:22:33,206
I'M REOPENING
MY SALON TONIGHT.

490
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:34,690
I STILL GOT TO JUSTIN'S SCHOOL
THIS MORNING

491
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,675
TO HELP WITH THE BAKE SALE.
IT'S ABOUT BALANCE.

492
00:22:37,675 --> 00:22:40,925
YEAH, WELL, BALANCE IS SOMETHING
YOU LEARN WHEN YOU HAVE TO.

493
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:43,488
ANYWAY, BETTY'S
IN A DIFFERENT PLACE RIGHT NOW.

494
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:44,999
YEAH, I GUESS.

495
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:47,581
BUT WE USED TO BE SO CLOSE,

496
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:48,894
AND NOW SHE'S LIVING
IN THE CITY.

497
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:51,175
SHE'S GOT THIS WHOLE
OTHER LIFE, YOU KNOW?

498
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,188
SOMETIMES I JUST-
I WANT MY LITTLE SISTER BACK.

499
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:56,999
OH. YEAH, I KNOW.

500
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:58,659
OOH! OH!

501
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:00,425
CHRISTINA.

502
00:23:00,425 --> 00:23:01,800
OKAY. OH, GOD.

503
00:23:02,844 --> 00:23:04,488
HOW DO
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN LABOR?

504
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,378
IF YOU HAVE TO ASK,
YOU'RE NOT IN LABOR.

505
00:23:07,891 --> 00:23:08,581
RIGHT. OKAY.

506
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:17,187
EXCUSE ME.

507
00:23:17,237 --> 00:23:18,503
AH. CH-CH.

508
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:24,050
YES? YES?

509
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:27,550
HI. UM,
I'M FROM "MODE" MAGAZINE.

510
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:31,237
I'M HERE TO PICK UP
A HALSTON DRESS FROM HIS, UM,

511
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:33,878
UH, FIREWORKS COLLECTION.

512
00:23:33,878 --> 00:23:34,815
YES, YES.

513
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:37,519
SOMEONE FROM YOUR MAGAZINE
ALREADY CAME AND GOT IT.

514
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:40,113
WHAT? WHO?

515
00:23:41,363 --> 00:23:43,050
BETTY SUAREZ.

516
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,175
OH, NO.
NO. UM, I'M BETTY SUAREZ.

517
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,238
NO, NO.

518
00:23:47,238 --> 00:23:48,956
SHE LEFT A CARD.

519
00:23:53,828 --> 00:23:55,300
AND SHE HAD A RATHER...

520
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,878
HORRIBLE PINK STRIPE
IN HER HAIR.

521
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,128
TERI.

522
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,250
BETTY, YOU'RE FIRED.

523
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,488
YOU'RE NOT FIRED. DON'T
WORRY. DON'T WORRY?

524
00:24:09,488 --> 00:24:11,222
BECAUSE OF BETTY,
WE ALMOST LOST KEIRA KNIGHTLEY

525
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:14,738
AND 30 PAGES OF AD REVENUE.

526
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:16,128
I'M SORRY.

527
00:24:16,406 --> 00:24:18,737
I AM SO SORRY.

528
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:20,925
AT THE CLUB, I GOT UP TO USE
THE BATHROOM, AND TERI

529
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:23,956
MUST HAVE TAKEN THE INFORMATION
FROM MY BlackBerry.

530
00:24:24,316 --> 00:24:26,956
I THOUGHT THAT...
SHE WAS A FRIEND.

531
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,375
FRIENDSHIP IS
THE OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK.

532
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:31,941
OKAY, LET'S NOT PANIC YET.
"ELLE" MAY BE RIVALS OF OURS,

533
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:33,425
BUT THEY'RE ALSO
BUSINESS PEOPLE.

534
00:24:33,425 --> 00:24:36,143
WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK,
RIGHT?

535
00:24:37,438 --> 00:24:38,925
MARC, SET UP THE CALL.

536
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,500
HELLO. JOE ZEE, ROBBIE,
NICE TO SEE YOU BOTH.

537
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,237
THANKS FOR TAKING OUR CALL.

538
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:50,753
<i>Anything for you, Daniel.
ROBBIE, I LOVE THE NEW DO.</i>

539
00:24:50,753 --> 00:24:53,175
<i>All that height
really makes a statement.</i>

540
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:54,612
<i>Thanks, Willie.</i>

541
00:24:54,612 --> 00:24:56,862
<i>Those earrings really make
your face look small.</i>

542
00:24:57,922 --> 00:24:59,487
<i>Okay, so, uh, listen, guys.</i>

543
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:02,999
<i>We have reason to believe that one of
your assistants... Teri O'Shoughnessy...</i>

544
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:06,878
<i>may have taken a certain
Halston dress we have on hold.</i>

545
00:25:06,878 --> 00:25:08,488
<i>I don't know
what they're talking about.</i>

546
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:13,581
<i>THAT'S HER. YOU'RE LYING, TERI, AND YOU
KNOW IT. Oh, yeah? Prove it, brace face!</i>

547
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:15,800
YOUR PINK STRIPE IS STUPID.

548
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,925
OKAY. ENOUGH. ENOUGH.
OKAY.

549
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:22,362
LISTEN, LET'S CUT THE BULL.
WE ALL KNOW YOU HAVE THE DRESS.

550
00:25:22,362 --> 00:25:25,362
YOU'RE HOLDING IT HOSTAGE
AND TRYING TO RUIN OUR COVER.

551
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:29,112
<i>That's right. We heard you got
Keira Knightley for the cover.</i>

552
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,925
<i>I hope this missing dress isn't
gonna be a big problem for you.</i>

553
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:33,488
<i>Nice talking to you.</i>

554
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,487
CONSIDER YOURSELVES DISINVITED
FROM MY COCKTAIL PARTY.

555
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:40,440
<i>Yeah,
they weren't coming anyway.</i>

556
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,738
<i>We're having
our own party tonight.</i>

557
00:25:42,738 --> 00:25:44,269
<i>Betty, call me.</i>

558
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,378
I COULD MURDER SOMEONE
RIGHT NOW.

559
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:52,050
COME ON.
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

560
00:25:52,313 --> 00:25:54,675
PEOPLE WHO MAKE MISTAKES
LIKE THAT

561
00:25:54,675 --> 00:25:57,999
DON'T BELONG
IN THIS BUSINESS.

562
00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:58,925
MARC!

563
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:06,550
DANIEL, I FEEL TERRIBLE.
I'M SORRY.

564
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,362
THIS IS MY FAULT.

565
00:26:08,362 --> 00:26:10,331
IF IT'S ANYONE'S FAULT,
IT WAS MINE.

566
00:26:10,331 --> 00:26:12,999
I JUST SHOULD HAVE HAD
AN EDITOR HANDLE IT.

567
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:16,441
NO. LOOK, I COULD FIX THIS.

568
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,000
I COULD, UH,
I'LL CALL THE COLLECTOR,

569
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,300
SEE IF HE HAS ANOTHER GOWN, AND
I'LL CALL KEIRA'S PUBLICIST. BETTY-

570
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,999
I'M SURE IF WE GOT ANOTHER DRESS, THEN SHE
- BETTY, COME ON. GO HOME. I GOT IT FROM HERE, OKAY?

571
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:43,925
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR INTERVIEWING ME.

572
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:45,940
I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A NEWSPAPER BEFORE.

573
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,999
YEAH, WELL, WE'RE GONNA NEED
ABOUT 40 COPIES

574
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:51,894
AND PHOTO APPROVAL, IF POSSIBLE. I'M THE
SURROGATE, SO I'M NOT GONNA BE NAMING IT.

575
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:53,706
THAT'S WEIRD. WHAT DOES
THE FATHER HAVE TO SAY?

576
00:26:53,706 --> 00:26:57,315
NOT A LOT. HE DIED BEFORE
THE BABY WAS CONCEIVED. OH!

577
00:26:57,797 --> 00:26:58,441
MM.
WHAT?

578
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:01,238
OH.
POOR CHRISTINA'S

579
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:03,628
GOING THROUGH THE
PREGNANCY STORY AGAIN. AH.

580
00:27:03,815 --> 00:27:05,675
MAYBE YOU COULD GO OUT THERE,
RUN INTERFERENCE.

581
00:27:05,675 --> 00:27:08,863
NO. I'M NOT REALLY
IN A PARTY KIND OF MOOD.

582
00:27:08,863 --> 00:27:11,175
<i>ARE YOU STILL STEWING
ABOUT THAT DRESS, MIJA?</i>

583
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:13,300
YOU CAN DEAL WITH IT ON MONDAY.
LET IT GO.

584
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,999
LET IT GO?

585
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:18,597
DAD, BECAUSE OF ME,
"MODE" LOST BUSINESS TODAY.

586
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:20,753
YOU DIDN'T SEE THE LOOK
ON DANIEL'S FACE.

587
00:27:20,753 --> 00:27:22,675
IT'S LIKE
HE'S LOSING FAITH IN ME.

588
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:27,300
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I LET
THAT TERI USE ME LIKE THAT.

589
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,503
IN FACT, WHERE'S
HER STUPID BUSINESS CARD?

590
00:27:30,503 --> 00:27:33,550
I CAN'T STAND THAT IT'S ANYWHERE
NEAR MY ORGAN DONOR CARD.

591
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,175
MOM WANTS TO KNOW
WHERE THE CHEESE CUBES ARE

592
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:36,628
AND CRAZY FINGERNAIL LADY
WANTS TO KNOW

593
00:27:36,628 --> 00:27:39,815
IF WE CAN SPIKE HER CIDER
WITH RUM. HERE. TAKE THIS.

594
00:27:39,815 --> 00:27:42,675
I'LL TALK
TO CRAZY FINGERNAIL LADY.

595
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:46,738
HA! THERE YOU ARE,
YOU BIG JERK, TERI.

596
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,378
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH, MARC.
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

597
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,113
BETTY, MY CLIENT IS DYING TO
MEET YOU. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

598
00:28:04,113 --> 00:28:07,999
I'M SO SORRY, HILDA, BUT I HAVE TO GO.
BETTY, THE PARTY HAS HARDLY EVEN STARTED.

599
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:09,987
I KNOW, BUT I THINK
I FOUND A WAY I CAN GET

600
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:11,128
THAT HALSTON DRESS
BACK FROM "ELLE."

601
00:28:12,188 --> 00:28:13,956
IT'S A LONG SHOT,
BUT I'M GONNA TRY.

602
00:28:14,313 --> 00:28:16,550
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE NICE?
IF YOU WERE EXCITED

603
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:20,613
<i>ABOUT SOMETHING I WAS DOING FOR A
CHANGE. OH, I AM. I AM. I-I JUST-</i>

604
00:28:20,613 --> 00:28:23,425
I JUST HAVE TO DO THIS REALLY
QUICK. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

605
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:25,566
YOU KNOW WHAT, BETTY?
DON'T BOTHER.

606
00:28:26,188 --> 00:28:27,550
HILDA.

607
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,937
<i>PAPI, CAN YOU TALK TO HER,
PLEASE? SHE'S BEING RIDICULOUS.</i>

608
00:28:33,987 --> 00:28:35,988
NO, SHE'S NOT. YOU ARE.

609
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:39,300
WHAT? DO YOU HAVE ANY
IDEA HOW HARD HILDA WORKED

610
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,175
TO GET ALL THIS READY,
BY HERSELF, I MIGHT ADD?

611
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:45,362
<i>THAT IS NOT FAIR.
PAPI, THIS IS MY CAREER.</i>

612
00:28:45,362 --> 00:28:48,187
I AM WORKING HARD
TO TRY AND MOVE UP.

613
00:28:48,237 --> 00:28:49,737
AND IF THAT MEANS
THAT I'M GONNA MISS

614
00:28:49,737 --> 00:28:51,487
A FAMILY PARTY
EVERY NOW AND THEN,

615
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:54,175
WELL, THEN I DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE. I HAVE TO DO THIS.

616
00:28:54,175 --> 00:28:56,503
YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE.
YOU'RE CHOOSING TO LEAVE.

617
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:59,707
DAD. NO, NO. NO ONE SUPPORTS
YOU MORE THAN YOUR FAMILY.

618
00:28:59,707 --> 00:29:02,487
WE ARE ALWAYS
BEHIND YOU 100%.

619
00:29:02,487 --> 00:29:05,425
BUT RIGHT NOW
HILDA NEEDS YOU.

620
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,315
<i>PAPI, I AM SORRY THAT
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS,</i>

621
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:12,456
BUT I HAVE TO GO.

622
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:30,550
CONNOR, MOLLY,

623
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,862
SO GLAD YOU MADE IT.

624
00:29:31,862 --> 00:29:35,129
HEY. YOUR PLACE IS AMAZING.
WHAT A GREAT VIEW OF THE CITY.

625
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:37,738
OH, THANKS.
WELL, I LOVE LOOKING DOWN

626
00:29:37,738 --> 00:29:40,253
AT THE LITTLE PEOPLE GOING ABOUT
THEIR LITTLE LIVES.

627
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:44,738
UM, MOLLY, DEAR, DO YOU MIND
IF I STEAL CONNOR AWAY?

628
00:29:44,738 --> 00:29:46,378
THERE'S SOMEONE
HE HAS TO MEET.

629
00:29:51,578 --> 00:29:52,425
EXCUSE ME.

630
00:29:54,891 --> 00:29:55,175
HI.

631
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,457
NICE DRESS.

632
00:29:59,062 --> 00:30:02,769
THANKS. IT'S NO CARLOS MIELE,
BUT IT DOES THE TRICK.

633
00:30:03,766 --> 00:30:06,207
I CAN'T GET OVER HOW BEAUTIFUL
THIS IS. IT'S BREATHTAKING.

634
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,238
UM, COULD...

635
00:30:09,972 --> 00:30:11,690
I- I'D LIKE
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

636
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:14,238
DO YOU MIND IF WE JUST
GO SOMEWHERE

637
00:30:14,238 --> 00:30:19,300
A LITTLE MORE PRIVATE TO TALK? OKAY.

638
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,999
RYAN, THANKS AGAIN FOR HELPING
US GET IN. OH, NO PROBLEM.

639
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,363
YOU TALKED TO ME FOR, LIKE,
20 MINUTES AT THAT BAR.

640
00:30:29,363 --> 00:30:31,550
NOBODY EVER TALKS TO THE CATERER.
WELL, YOU WERE VERY INTERESTING.

641
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,925
TICK-TOCK, BETTY. THAT DRESS AIN'T
GONNA WALK ITSELF OUT. THANK YOU.

642
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:34,956
YEAH. GOOD LUCK.

643
00:30:39,188 --> 00:30:40,988
OKAY. I HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

644
00:30:40,988 --> 00:30:42,378
THE BEST WAY TO SAY THIS,

645
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:45,612
BUT.. THERE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE ONE.

646
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,300
UM...

647
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:52,175
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO GET YOU OUT OF MY MIND

648
00:30:52,425 --> 00:30:53,691
SINCE WE MET.

649
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,316
DANIEL, I-

650
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,378
PLEASE.
J- JUST LET ME FINISH.

651
00:31:00,113 --> 00:31:01,363
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T DO THIS.

652
00:31:01,363 --> 00:31:04,441
I KNOW IT'S-IT'S BAD
AND TERRIBLE AND WRONG,

653
00:31:04,441 --> 00:31:06,675
AND I'M JEOPARDIZING
A FRIENDSHIP

654
00:31:06,675 --> 00:31:08,675
AND A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.

655
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:11,050
I MEAN, YOU...
CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY TIMES

656
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,175
I'VE TRIED TO TALK MYSELF
OUT OF THIS.

657
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:17,753
BUT I CAN'T CHANGE
THE WAY I FEEL.

658
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:19,190
DANIEL...

659
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:21,425
<i>I'M ENGAGED.</i>

660
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:24,300
I
- CONNOR AND I HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS.

661
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,300
HE HAS BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH WITH ME.

662
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,175
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH.
I DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM.

663
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:32,237
NEITHER DO I.

664
00:31:33,578 --> 00:31:35,144
MOLLY...

665
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:40,112
IF YOU CAN HONESTLY TELL ME
YOU DON'T HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME,

666
00:31:40,687 --> 00:31:43,175
I'LL LET YOU WALK OUT THAT DOOR,
GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE.

667
00:31:43,343 --> 00:31:46,050
I'LL NEVER SAY ANOTHER WORD
ABOUT THIS AGAIN.

668
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,050
I PROMISE.

669
00:31:59,937 --> 00:32:01,737
SO I LEAN ACROSS TO HER
AND I WHISPER...

670
00:32:01,737 --> 00:32:03,050
"NO, THAT'S AL PACINO."

671
00:32:03,265 --> 00:32:05,238
SHE SAYS,
"I DIDN'T ORDER A CAPPUCCINO."

672
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:09,425
OH, ZAC.
IT'S THAT ACCENT.

673
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:10,999
I MEAN, WHO CAN UNDERSTAND
A WORD HE SAYS?

674
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:14,800
WHO CARES WHAT HE SOUNDS LIKE?
LOOK AT THE WAY HE LOOKS.

675
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,800
SO, UH, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN DATING?

676
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,175
OH. OH, NO, NO. NO. NO, WE'RE NOT.

677
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:23,941
<i>WE'RE-WE'RE NOT DATING. I'M SORRY. IT'S
JUST-YOU MAKE THE MOST DIVINE COUPLE.</i>

678
00:32:25,925 --> 00:32:27,362
EXCUSE ME.

679
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,113
FOR THE RECORD, I-I WAS
EXTREMELY FLATTERED BY THAT.

680
00:32:35,844 --> 00:32:38,769
ANY MAN IN HIS RIGHT MIND
WOULD BE PROUD TO BE WITH YOU.

681
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,519
WELL, WE WOULD MAKE
QUITE THE POWER COUPLE.

682
00:32:42,969 --> 00:32:44,721
WELL, WE DEFINITELY GET
WHERE EACH OTHER'S COMING FROM.

683
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:46,878
THAT CAN BE HARD TO FIND.

684
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,938
CONNOR, I, UM,
I- I HAVE TO ADMIT,

685
00:32:51,988 --> 00:32:54,175
EVER SINCE WE HAD
OUR BUSINESS TRIP,

686
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,999
I FIND IT HARD
TO BE AROUND YOU.

687
00:32:57,112 --> 00:32:59,987
I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT FEELING TOO WELL.

688
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:01,425
DO YOU MIND IF WE LEAVE?

689
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:03,566
NO, NOT AT ALL.

690
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:06,862
UM... THANK YOU FOR THE PARTY.
IT-IT WAS LOVELY.

691
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:09,378
OH, YES. THANK YOU.
MM.

692
00:33:25,268 --> 00:33:26,050
HAVE YOU FOUND IT YET?

693
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,191
OH, WAIT. HERE.
I FOUND THE LIGHTS.

694
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:32,175
YAY! THERE IT IS.

695
00:33:32,563 --> 00:33:34,863
EXACTLY WHERE
I SAID IT WOULD BE.

696
00:33:34,863 --> 00:33:39,175
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH, MARC, FOR HELPING ME.
I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR YOU. I'M DOING THIS TO GET

697
00:33:39,175 --> 00:33:40,878
A BETTER CHRISTMAS PRESENT
FROM WILHELMINA.

698
00:33:40,878 --> 00:33:45,519
THAT'S THE SPIRIT. OH, MY GOD!
THEY STILL DO THE UGLY WALL!

699
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:47,988
THIS WAS TOTALLY MY IDEA.

700
00:33:47,988 --> 00:33:50,863
EVERY DAY WE WOULD PUT UP
PICTURES OF COWORKERS WE HATED

701
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:51,999
AND THEN MAKE FUN OF THEM.

702
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:54,050
OH, GOOD TIMES.

703
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,612
HEY, HURRY UP,
SLOWPOKE RODRIGUEZ.

704
00:33:56,612 --> 00:34:00,863
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE ALL NIGHT. YEAH,
WELL, THESE VINTAGE SNAPS ARE VERY SENSITIVE,

705
00:34:00,863 --> 00:34:02,988
AND I DON'T WANT
TO TEAR THE DRESS.

706
00:34:04,828 --> 00:34:06,253
COME ON! COME INSIDE.

707
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,300
EXCUSE US. PARDON US. EXCUSE US. UH,
OH, OH, OH. OUT OF THE WAY. SORRY.

708
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,738
SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.
EXCUSE US. PARDON US.

709
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:29,300
WE JUST HAVE TO GET HER
TO A TAXI. SHE IS REALLY DRUNK.

710
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,987
EXCUSE US. NO, NO, NO. THIS WAY. THE
ELEVATORS ARE THIS WAY. YES, NO, THIS WAY.

711
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,550
THE ELEV-
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

712
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,738
UM...

713
00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:39,612
WE'RE TAKING OUR DRESS BACK.
MARC, RUN.

714
00:34:40,113 --> 00:34:42,566
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
WHOO! HEY. GET OUT OF HERE.

715
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,488
HOLD THE ELEVATOR!

716
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,675
HEY, TERI! CALL ME.

717
00:35:00,738 --> 00:35:03,987
* ALL IS NOT AS IT SEEMS

718
00:35:05,362 --> 00:35:06,613
THANK YOU.

719
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:11,878
I TAKE IT YOUR CONVERSATION
WITH MOLLY DIDN'T GO VERY WELL.

720
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,987
I GUESS WE BOTH LOST OUT
TONIGHT, HUH?

721
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:17,988
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

722
00:35:17,988 --> 00:35:22,378
COME ON. I'M NOT STUPID. I KNOW
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN CONNOR.

723
00:35:23,238 --> 00:35:25,269
WELL, WHAT WOULD
MAKE YOU THINK THAT?

724
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:28,238
WELL... ONCE I REALIZED
YOU DIDN'T HAVE

725
00:35:28,238 --> 00:35:30,191
A BUSINESS MOTIVE
FOR HELPING ME,

726
00:35:30,191 --> 00:35:32,112
I FIGURED YOU MUST HAVE
A PERSONAL ONE.

727
00:35:32,687 --> 00:35:34,800
AND I'VE SEEN
THE WAY YOU LOOK AT HIM.

728
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,862
WELL, THAT'S JUST-
RELAX.

729
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:40,300
I'M NOT GONNA HOLD THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE HUMAN AGAINST YOU.

730
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,737
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME.

731
00:35:44,891 --> 00:35:46,768
* YOU WILL SEE

732
00:35:48,812 --> 00:35:49,862
* HEAVENLY

733
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,191
I CAN'T SAY I'M NOT INTRIGUED.

734
00:36:03,062 --> 00:36:05,300
I GUESS THE THREE OF YOU

735
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,550
MAY COME IN.

736
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,987
WE'RE IN.

737
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,675
PINCH ME.

738
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:19,999
DON'T TOUCH ME.

739
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,269
YOU GUYS ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

740
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:25,766
IT WAS NOTHING.

741
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,125
WELL, IT WASN'T NOTHING.

742
00:36:27,175 --> 00:36:30,691
WELL, EITHER WAY, YOU TWO
SHOULD STAY, ENJOY YOURSELVES.

743
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,988
YOU DESERVE IT.

744
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:37,175
OH, MY GOD.

745
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,250
THIS IS A DEFINING MOMENT.
I'M THE FIRST ASSISTANT

746
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,191
WHO'S EVER BEEN INVITED
TO A WILHELMINA SLATER PARTY.

747
00:36:43,191 --> 00:36:46,175
WELL, I'M HERE, TOO.
NOT WHEN I TELL THE STORY.

748
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:51,237
DOORS ARE REALLY OPENING FOR US,
AREN'T THEY?

749
00:36:51,894 --> 00:36:52,812
IT'S ALL STARTING.

750
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,254
OH, MY GOD. THERE'S TOM WOLFE
AND ZAC POSEN.

751
00:37:00,113 --> 00:37:00,472
MM.
AND...

752
00:37:00,472 --> 00:37:02,112
JODIE PAPADAKIS.

753
00:37:22,062 --> 00:37:24,894
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE EVER SEEN AN ASSISTANT

754
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:29,440
AT A WILHELMINA SLATER FUNCTION.
WELL, YOU KNOW, JUST, UH, NETWORKING.

755
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:32,862
I HAVE ALL 40 OF
MY NEW CONTACTS, BY THE WAY.

756
00:37:32,862 --> 00:37:33,800
DO YOU?

757
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,753
MM-HMM.

758
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:37,488
TELL ME-
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT-

759
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:40,378
HAVE YOU TRIED
THE SHRIMP YET?

760
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,050
NO.

761
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,999
THEY'RE VERY SPICY.

762
00:37:44,313 --> 00:37:45,550
SPICY!

763
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,378
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
IF I LIKE THEM OR NOT.

764
00:37:48,378 --> 00:37:49,191
I THINK I DO.

765
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:52,988
JODIE,
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

766
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:57,925
I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF YOURS
FOR A VERY LONG TIME NOW,

767
00:37:57,925 --> 00:37:58,940
AND...

768
00:37:59,562 --> 00:38:01,737
WELL, I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WOULD EVER CONSIDER

769
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,175
BEING MY MENTOR?

770
00:38:05,062 --> 00:38:07,207
LET'S START

771
00:38:07,207 --> 00:38:09,675
WITH ME NOT KICKING YOU
OUT OF Y.E.T.I...

772
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,112
AND WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE.

773
00:38:19,234 --> 00:38:22,378
HI. BETTY SUAREZ, "MODE"
MAGAZINE. WELL, HOW DO YOU DO?

774
00:38:22,378 --> 00:38:24,675
OH, I'M A VERY BIG FAN
OF YOUR PUBLICATION.

775
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:35,550
HELLO?

776
00:38:36,813 --> 00:38:38,050
JUSTIN?

777
00:38:39,188 --> 00:38:40,504
<i>PAPI?</i>

778
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,362
9个未接电话

779
00:39:00,831 --> 00:39:01,987
HILDA, WHERE ARE YOU?
WHAT HAPPENED?

780
00:39:03,235 --> 00:39:04,925
WE'RE AT THE HOSPITAL.

781
00:39:04,987 --> 00:39:05,940
What?

782
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,753
OH, MY GOD!
DID CHRISTINA GO INTO LABOR?

783
00:39:08,753 --> 00:39:09,862
No.

784
00:39:10,484 --> 00:39:11,425
BETTY...

785
00:39:12,378 --> 00:39:15,581
<i>PAPI HAD A HEART ATTACK.</i>

786
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,753
WHAT?

787
00:39:44,628 --> 00:39:45,565
MOLLY?

788
00:39:51,128 --> 00:39:52,237
YOU WERE RIGHT.

789
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,815
I CAN'T SAY I DON'T HAVE
FEELINGS FOR YOU.

790
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:06,425
I BROKE UP WITH CONNOR.

791
00:40:15,362 --> 00:40:18,628
* OH, NOTHING'S GONNA CHANGE
MY LOVE FOR YOU *

792
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,378
* I WANNA SPEND MY LIFE
WITH YOU *

793
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:30,440
* SO WE MAKE LOVE
IN THE GRASS UNDER THE MOON *

794
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:33,863
* NO ONE CAN TELL

795
00:40:33,863 --> 00:40:36,050
* DAMNED IF I DO

796
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:41,925
* FOREVER JOURNEY

797
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:45,253

* SINCE I LOVE YOU

799
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:50,050

801
00:40:54,425 --> 00:40:58,987
