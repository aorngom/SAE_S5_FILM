1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,184
Did you get my e-mails?

2
00:00:01,194 --> 00:00:04,220
Yeah, I was busy
with my boyfriend.

3
00:00:05,012 --> 00:00:07,735
Do we have that attorney-client
privilege thing?

4
00:00:07,745 --> 00:00:09,588
That only works if I'm your lawyer,
but for now

5
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:11,980
you've got something
stronger than that--my word.

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,851
Marc booked your
flight for paris.

7
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:15,112
You leave tonight at 9:00.

8
00:00:15,122 --> 00:00:17,865
I want to see Justin in return.
I want to see my son.

9
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:21,607
You need to find whatever it
is you're looking for, Daniel.

10
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:24,220
I just know now
that it's not me.

11
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:28,995
I think it's time for Fey
Sommers to come out of seclusion.

12
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:30,189
Fey?

13
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:44,791
Betty Suarez here.

14
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,791
No, Betty Suarez here
at home an hour ago.

15
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:51,272
Daniel hasn't left yet.

16
00:00:51,438 --> 00:00:52,863
He's doing paperwork.

17
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,111
Yeah, well, the lawyer's 
gonna be here any minute

18
00:00:55,127 --> 00:00:56,821
- to go over dad's immigration case.
- I know, I know.

19
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:58,270
I'll get home as soon as I can.

20
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:00,101
And what about shopping
for Thanksgiving dinner?

21
00:01:00,138 --> 00:01:01,831
Hilda, I will get it done.

22
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:03,411
Look, I gotta go.

23
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:07,131
Since I started here,
she acts like all of a sudden

24
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:08,711
I don't care about our family.

25
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:10,592
I always do the shopping
for Thanksgiving,

26
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:13,223
and then every year my father
and I cook the meal together.

27
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:15,620
It's been our tradition
since my mother passed away.

28
00:01:16,496 --> 00:01:18,842
I'm sorry, you were looking
at me and saying things.

29
00:01:18,856 --> 00:01:20,400
I wasn't really listening.

30
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:21,812
Never mind.

31
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:24,973
So you've got big plans tomorrow with
this new guy you've been seeing?

32
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:26,160
Now what makes you say that?

33
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:28,711
You keep walking past Daniel's office,
saying really loudly

34
00:01:28,726 --> 00:01:31,473
that you've got big plans with
this new guy you've been seeing.

35
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,073
Not anymore.

36
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:35,562
Jerk called about an hour ago.

37
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:38,133
Says he has to spend Thanksgiving
with his wife and kids.

38
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:39,433
I'm, like, grow a pair.

39
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:41,961
I am so over men.
They all suck.

40
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,380
Where's Marc?

41
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,150
- Hi.
- Hi.

42
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:49,680
Hey, what are you
still doing here?

43
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:51,771
The high priestess
needs her outfit altered

44
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:53,900
for some dinner she's
going to tomorrow.

45
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:55,870
Oh, what time do I need
to be at your place?

46
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:56,783
Around 3:00.

47
00:01:56,796 --> 00:01:58,213
Now is that the time
we're actually eating,

48
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:00,763
or is that the time that that
delightful little nephew of yours

49
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:03,311
is putting on his production of
"Thanksgiving, the musical"?

50
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:04,663
We're eating at 6:00.

51
00:02:04,677 --> 00:02:06,313
I'll see you at 6:00, then.

52
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:17,311
Um, the phone stopped
ringing a while ago,

53
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:19,273
and it looks like everybody's
gone for the holiday.

54
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,853
Do you think maybe I could...

55
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:23,282
Oh. Yeah, sure.

56
00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:24,873
Okay.

57
00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:28,733
You--you haven't, um... seen...
Sofia up here today, right?

58
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:32,603
Okay, and there's no calls?

59
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:35,082
Sorry.

60
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:37,892
Oh, no, no, I don't care.
I mean, she's got a boyfriend, right?

61
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:40,861
Who she never happened to mention,
I might add.

62
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:42,533
I mean,
if you're serious about a guy,

63
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:44,123
you'd be talking about
him all the time, right?

64
00:02:44,157 --> 00:02:46,783
You're always going on and
on about that guy Wilbur.

65
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:47,950
Walter.

66
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:51,810
- Daniel, are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

67
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:54,730
I spent the day waiting by the phone,
checking my e-mail every two minutes.

68
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:57,732
It's like I'm this close to splitting
a cobb salad with Sarah Jessica Parker

69
00:02:57,767 --> 00:02:59,360
and talking about shoes.

70
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:04,842
I really miss that show.

71
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,521
So whatcha doing tomorrow?

72
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:12,822
I have to drag my well-toned
ass up to Schenectady,

73
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:14,771
eat cranberry sauce
in the shape of a can

74
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:17,931
and tell my family all about my
girlfriend, who lives up in Canada.

75
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:19,890
You  wanna blow 'em
off and hang out?

76
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,490
Tempting. What
are you thinking?

77
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:23,081
We meet here at 9:00.

78
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:25,022
I bring the champagne,
you bring the orange juice,

79
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:27,041
and we watch the parade
from Wilhelmina's window.

80
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:29,481
And by "watch the parade,"
you mean try on couture gowns

81
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:30,842
and xerox our naughty bits?

82
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:31,581
Of course.

83
00:03:31,597 --> 00:03:33,280
I am so in.

84
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:37,670
French cuff or no?

85
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:39,623
- No.
- I'd go with the cuff.

86
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:42,211
You want to live my life,
pay my bills.

87
00:03:42,648 --> 00:03:44,402
Ooh, sassy.

88
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:47,140
Uh, Louis from Armani called--

89
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:49,431
not happy with his
placement in the issue.

90
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:53,473
Dr. Levy needs to move your
teeth whitening to tuesday,

91
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:57,161
and... oh, Nico said to tell you
she's coming in town for Thanksgiving.

92
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:58,151
What?

93
00:03:58,168 --> 00:04:00,433
She told me last week she
was staying at school.

94
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:02,632
I can't just change my
plans at the last minute.

95
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:05,731
I have the Versace
party to go to. Ouch!

96
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,882
It's a work obligation.

97
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:10,650
I can't shirk my responsibilities
just to sit home

98
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,312
and have a very
Brady Thanksgiving.

99
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:15,450
She'll just have to understand.

100
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:17,710
What are you staring at?

101
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:20,381
Oh... you're gonna
cuff that, right?

102
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,611
Okay, so don't forget,
your dad has a brunch

103
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,630
at 2:00 p.m.
in the executive dining room.

104
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:32,030
- I'm gonna pass on that.
- What?

105
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:35,062
- Slimming.
- Thanks, Marc.

106
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:37,123
You have to go.
It's your family.

107
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:39,690
Oh, come on. It's not like
it's some intimate gathering.

108
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:41,440
My father invites
all his editors

109
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,793
so everyone can tell
him what a genius he is.

110
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:46,313
Oh, and this year,
my mother will be fresh out of detox,

111
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:48,080
stealing  the olives
out of martini glasses

112
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:50,472
and sucking 'em dry in
the janitor's closet.

113
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:51,860
No, thanks.

114
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:53,503
Knock, knock.

115
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:55,270
Oh, am I
interrupting something?

116
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:56,880
- Oh, hey.
- No.

117
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:58,643
- Betty was just leaving.
- Yes, I was.

118
00:04:58,655 --> 00:04:59,613
- Bye, Betty.
- Bye.

119
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,721
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

120
00:05:00,756 --> 00:05:02,163
Happy Thanksgiving.

121
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:04,811
- Hi.
- Hi.

122
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:08,513
So what's new?

123
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:13,061
Met this girl, had some fun.

124
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:16,751
Found out she has a boyfriend
she didn't tell me about.

125
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:19,971
Wow, she sounds like a bitch. 

126
00:05:20,606 --> 00:05:22,661
I'm sorry, Daniel.

127
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,532
I didn't know we were
gonna do what we did,

128
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:29,201
and things just
got out of control.

129
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:33,773
I was actually hoping that
we could skip to the part

130
00:05:33,786 --> 00:05:36,922
where we move on and
we try to be friends?

131
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:39,221
I'd really like to
be your friend.

132
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:41,590
Me, too.

133
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:55,683
Friends' hands
don't go that low.

134
00:05:56,826 --> 00:05:59,170
I'll see you at your
father's brunch tomorrow.

135
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:01,683
Oh,  you're going?
But you R.S.V.P.'d "no."

136
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:03,712
I mean, not that I checked.

137
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:06,791
Well, I was supposed to go skiing,
but now I have to get back here

138
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,953
by friday, so whatever.

139
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:10,961
Sounds like fun.
You're gonna be there, right?

140
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:13,662
Oh, yeah, I'll be there.
I mean, it's my family, right?

141
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:16,123
Thanksgiving without
family would be...

142
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:17,843
thursday.

143
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:20,500
Great, 'cause I'm
bringing Hunter.

144
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,925
And you know, in a weird way,

145
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:25,089
I think you two will
really get along.

146
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:28,141
Great, yeah. Hunter.
I can't wait to meet him.

147
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:29,751
Hunter. Hun-ter.

148
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,280
I can't stop saying his name.
I love him already.

149
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:33,550
See you there.

150
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:58,160
Hey, nice turkey.

151
00:06:58,255 --> 00:07:00,093
You making one for everybody?

152
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:03,051
So you really invited
your ex for Thanksgiving.

153
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:04,670
Look who took her
grown up pill.

154
00:07:04,686 --> 00:07:06,950
Well, he is Justin's father.

155
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,840
Although these days a freakin'
Petri dish can be a father.

156
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:12,692
Right? So when did you
get divorced, anyway?

157
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,140
Oh, no, you have to be married 
to get divorced.

158
00:07:15,155 --> 00:07:18,353
No, this is the classic boy meets girl,
boy knocks girl up,

159
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:19,912
boy loses girl's number.

160
00:07:19,926 --> 00:07:22,772
Throw in a glass slipper,
and you got a hell of a fairy tale.

161
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:24,161
Exactly.

162
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,980
I'm home! I'm sorry!
Did you go over your case with Leah yet?

163
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:28,431
An hour ago, Betty.

164
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:30,301
I'm sorry.
I couldn't get off of work.

165
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:32,193
And you missed my
pageant at school.

166
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:34,943
I know, Justin, but there was 
no one to cover my phones.

167
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:37,061
Well, it was awesome.

168
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:39,431
I was the only pilgrim that
could do "jazz hands."

169
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:40,221
"Jazz" what?

170
00:07:40,238 --> 00:07:42,591
"Jazz"... "hands."

171
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:47,290
Oh. Well, I wanna hear all about this
as soon as I get home from shopping.

172
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:53,342
Oh, hi. You must be Leah.
I'm Betty. I'm so sorry--

173
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:55,402
What did you do?
You went to the market?

174
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,213
That doesn't exactly
sound like a "thank you."

175
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:59,372
Hilda, I told you that
I would do the shopping.

176
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:01,443
Well, since she started
this new job of hers,

177
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:03,872
- she has no more time anymore.
- Yeah, well, I have time.

178
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:05,961
I'm still doing all the
cooking with dad tomorrow.

179
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:07,860
Oh, really? And what if they
call tomorrow from the office

180
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:10,620
with some fashion emergency?
They've lowered the hemlines!

181
00:08:10,638 --> 00:08:11,600
Red alert!

182
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,643
Wait, you didn't even get the
stuff to make the buñuelos.

183
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:17,400
Why do you insist on
making those every year?

184
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:18,873
No one ever eats them.

185
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:21,350
Last year we had to use
them to crack open walnuts.

186
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,960
Because mom made them
every year, Hilda.

187
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:25,533
It's a tradition.

188
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:28,072
And that was the best
turkey they had?

189
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:30,091
No, that is the last
turkey they had.

190
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:32,251
You were this close to
stuffing a brisket.

191
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:36,673
Oh, I have so much to do.

192
00:08:36,985 --> 00:08:39,843
Well, I haven't even started to cook,
and I've still gotta go to the airport.

193
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:41,490
All the kids are
coming home tomorrow.

194
00:08:41,507 --> 00:08:44,672
Tell me about it. We're having our
three boys and their girlfriends.

195
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:46,942
I have no idea where we're
gonna put these people.

196
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:50,061
Well, we see 'em three times a year.
It's worth it.

197
00:08:58,096 --> 00:09:02,340
Will you stop looking at me like the
ghost of Thanksgiving yet to come?

198
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:03,560
Good night.

199
00:09:03,988 --> 00:09:07,091
I see an old woman,
all alone...

200
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:10,493
at a Thanksgiving
table set for one.

201
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:34,472
Ciao, tesoro, it's Wilhelmina.

202
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:38,451
Yes. Listen, something came up,

203
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:41,412
and I won't be able
to make it tomorrow.

204
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:44,913
Nico's coming home.

205
00:09:44,926 --> 00:09:46,402
Yes.

206
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:49,042
# Toot, toot, hey, beep, beep #

207
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:55,390
# Toot, toot, hey, beep, beep #

208
00:09:56,518 --> 00:09:57,993
# Bad girls #

209
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,713
So,  looks like I'm
not the only one

210
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:04,251
doing a little last minute
Thanksgiving shopping.

211
00:10:04,997 --> 00:10:07,623
A carton of cigarettes
and a bottle of vodka?

212
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:09,801
You have your traditions.
I have mine.

213
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:13,212
So... having some
big blowout today?

214
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:15,472
No, Gina, just the family.

215
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:17,252
I thought you would've
gone all out this year.

216
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:20,762
I mean, you never know who won't
be around next Thanksgiving.

217
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:22,460
What is that supposed to mean?

218
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:24,622
Come on.
It's a small neighborhood.

219
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:25,743
People talk.

220
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:29,011
Everyone knows about your
pop's immigration problem.

221
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:31,213
You know what? You have no idea
what you're talking about.

222
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,881
Hey, you wanna keep
it quiet, fine.

223
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,911
But in the spirit
of the holiday,

224
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:37,203
I think I should tell you--

225
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:39,643
watch out for that lawyer I saw
leaving your place last night.

226
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:41,272
Oh, really? And why is that?

227
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:44,811
Leah Stillman is bad news.
I know someone who knows someone

228
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:47,012
who knows Donna
Spadaro in Astoria.

229
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:49,390
Leah promised to get
her custody of her kids,

230
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:51,991
and all she did was steal
her money and take off.

231
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:55,012
Yeah, well, Hilda found Leah,
and I trust her.

232
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:57,073
Leah's not gonna rip us off.

233
00:10:57,085 --> 00:10:59,492
Well, don't say I
didn't warn you.

234
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:01,272
Oh, and tell your father

235
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,942
I wish him a very
happy Thanksgiving.

236
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,630
# You bad girl, you sad girl #

237
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:08,223
# You such a dirty bad girl #

240
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:29,092
- What city?
- Hi, in Astoria,

241
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,972
a Donna Spadaro, please.

242
00:11:32,128 --> 00:11:33,751
Hold for number.

243
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:36,192
Shoot, sorry. Never mind.

244
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:39,591
- Hi, Daniel. It's me--
- Betty, I need you now.

245
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:40,981
- Where are you?
- I'm at the loft. Hurry.

246
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:42,261
It's an emergency.

247
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:44,213
Hello?

248
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:46,293
What's going on?

249
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,620
I gotta go. Daniel just called.
He needs me.

250
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:51,312
- It's Thanksgiving.
- I know, I know.

251
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:54,030
Unbelievable. What about
cooking dinner with dad?

252
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:58,730
Will you tell him I'm sorry?

253
00:12:09,518 --> 00:12:11,832
Look, it's the Eva
Longoria float.

254
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:13,592
We love you, Eva.

255
00:12:14,407 --> 00:12:16,040
What if she has hidden
cameras in here?

256
00:12:16,056 --> 00:12:17,423
Oh, trust me,
if she had hidden cameras in here,

257
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:19,191
I'd have been fired
a long time ago.

258
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:22,362
Hey, what's that weird
float over there?

259
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:26,011
That's not a float.

260
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:27,670
That's Betty.

261
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,833
You called me over here to
help you pick out a shirt?

262
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:34,381
This is your big emergency?

263
00:12:34,398 --> 00:12:36,432
Would you rather I
swallowed a bottle of pills?

264
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:38,241
It took you 45
minutes to get here.

265
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,503
I'd be dead already.

266
00:12:39,515 --> 00:12:41,700
I left my family
on Thanksgiving.

267
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:44,480
I had to cut across
the parade route.

268
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:46,681
I almost got run over by
those "queer eye" guys

269
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:48,512
riding a giant pilgrim.

270
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:50,511
Okay, that came out wrong.

271
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:52,591
Betty, this is an emergency.

272
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:55,421
I have to sit across from Sofia
and her boyfriend at this brunch.

273
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:57,190
I've got to look good.

274
00:12:57,915 --> 00:12:59,642
Are you wearing cover-up?

275
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:02,152
I have a pimple, all right?
Go away.

276
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,500
You know what? I am going away.
Good-bye, Daniel.

277
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,031
No, no, wait.
What about the shirts?

278
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,052
And we haven't even
talked shoes yet.

279
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:12,662
I know this might come as a surprise
to you, but I have a life, too,

280
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:15,321
and a family that 
counts on me a lot.

281
00:13:15,335 --> 00:13:17,753
They already think that I
put you in front of them.

282
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:20,323
My dad is in legal problems,
my sister may have hired

283
00:13:20,338 --> 00:13:22,813
some shady lawyer,
and it's up to me to fix it.

284
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:24,943
So I sorry if I don't think that
coming over here and helping you

285
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:27,711
pick out a shirt to
impress a girl is priority.

286
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:30,751
And can I just say
one more thing?

287
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,763
No, I don't really want
to hear any more--

288
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,970
You're an amazing
person, Daniel.

289
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:36,903
Ah,  if you just
wanna blurt it out...

290
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,053
You're smart, you're handsome,

291
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,723
you were voted one of the
top ten bachelors in the city

292
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,102
- by some magazine.
- "Esquire."

293
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,103
I cannot believe that Sofia
actually has you questioning

294
00:13:47,115 --> 00:13:48,521
what a catch you are.

295
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:50,890
Trust me, Hunter is the one 
who should be nervous

296
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:52,563
about sitting across from you.

297
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:54,133
Thank you, Betty.

298
00:13:55,528 --> 00:13:56,903
Go with the purple.

299
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,162
Really?

300
00:13:58,175 --> 00:13:59,620
I came all the way down here.

301
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,310
Okay, no, no,
I'll wear the purple.

302
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:17,881
Hey, mom, is it okay if I sit
between dad and Christina?

303
00:14:17,897 --> 00:14:20,970
I really want to talk to her about
Stella McCartney's spring line.

304
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,063
Great.

305
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:24,091
I'm sure your father
will be very proud.

306
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:28,791
Hilda, what are you doing?
Forget the spoon.

307
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:30,923
Get your hands in
there and feel it.

308
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,443
I'm not feeling it.
I just got a manicure.

309
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,641
Ay, dios mío. Where's your sister?
She's got hands like meat hooks.

310
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:39,873
He's here! Dad's here!

311
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:41,680
He actually showed.
How about that?

312
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:42,421
Don't.

313
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:44,030
I guess when we want him to leave,
we can just tell him

314
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:46,340
you're pregnant and watch him run.
He's good at that.

315
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:48,892
Ancient history, papi, okay?

316
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:52,060
And let's not forget the reason
he's here is to give us the money

317
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:54,831
to pay for a lawyer so that
you don't get deported.

318
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:58,570
Well, look at you, little man.

319
00:14:58,585 --> 00:14:59,792
Hi, dad.

320
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:02,211
What happened to that little
shrimp I saw last time I was here?

321
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:04,111
That was, like, a year ago.

322
00:15:06,357 --> 00:15:08,060
This is to make up
for some lost time.

323
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,171
Thanks.

324
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,371
- Hey.
- Hey.

325
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:17,822
Thanks.

326
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:21,472
Place never changes.

327
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:26,240
The only thing missing
is your old man

328
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:28,373
sleeping in front of the TV.

329
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,193
Because the old man is
busy cooking dinner.

330
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,060
Ignacio.

331
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:40,910
You look good, man.

332
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:50,001
Glad you could make it.

333
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:03,250
Hi. Um, are you Donna Spadaro?

334
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:05,313
You don't know me.
I'm Betty Suarez.

335
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:06,360
Yeah?

336
00:16:06,378 --> 00:16:09,521
I'm so sorry to be bothering you,
but I just wanted to ask you

337
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:12,290
about a lawyer you might
have used--a Leah Stillman?

338
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:14,903
Are you from the
bar association?

339
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:16,731
I called you people
three months ago.

340
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:20,253
No, no, no, no,
I was just thinking about hiring her.

341
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:21,600
Don't do it.

342
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:24,222
I was fighting for
custody of my kids.

343
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:26,520
She tells me, "no problem.
I'll win."

344
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:30,362
Guarantees it. She files some papers,
takes all my money,

345
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:32,531
and I never hear
from her again.

346
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:33,770
Really?

347
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:37,071
She promised she'd have 'em
home with me for Thanksgiving.

348
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,463
Hey, cool, a costume.

349
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:45,380
Actually, it's a uniform, man,

350
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:47,321
from the Jets.
They're the best.

351
00:16:47,336 --> 00:16:49,293
Except for the Giants.

352
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:52,381
Hey, look at this.
I got you a helmet and a football.

353
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:55,273
Cool! Mom...

354
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:59,423
Look, I'm the
Phantom of the Opera.

355
00:17:01,828 --> 00:17:03,200
Hey, look who's here.

356
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:06,493
- Hi, Santos.
- Sorry.

357
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:10,240
So word is,
you're a big career girl now.

358
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:12,382
Yeah, not that big.
Where's Hilda?

359
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:16,653
Hilda! I need to
talk to you about--

360
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,012
- Hi, Leah!
- Hi.

361
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:21,522
She came over to pick up the rest
of the money that Santos brought.

362
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:23,743
Hope they pay you double time
for calling you in on a holiday.

363
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:25,972
You know, I should really get going
and let you get to your dinner.

364
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:27,571
Oh, okay.
I'll get you the rest of the money.

365
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:28,702
Wait!

366
00:17:30,568 --> 00:17:32,463
I need to talk to you first.

367
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:33,911
Upstairs.

368
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:35,213
So what--

369
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:40,623
Oh, so now you're listening
to that skank, Gina Gambarro?

370
00:17:40,636 --> 00:17:43,963
No, Hilda, I went to the woman's house,
and I saw her myself.

371
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:45,462
Well, maybe it's
a different Leah.

372
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:46,631
Maybe they got the name wrong.

373
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,381
I just think that before we give
that woman all of our money--

374
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:52,060
Well, I just think this is more
about the fact that I found Leah

375
00:17:52,077 --> 00:17:53,632
- and you didn't.
- What?!

376
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:57,211
Oh, yeah, this is all making sense.
I found the lawyer,

377
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:58,910
I'm saving dad from
being deported,

378
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:01,242
I even helped dad
with the cooking.

379
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:04,313
You're not the golden child anymore.
You can't deal with it.

380
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:06,141
Hilda,I am just trying to help.

381
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:08,491
Well, maybe we don't
need your help.

382
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:10,711
You can't just get
involved with the family

383
00:18:10,726 --> 00:18:12,852
when it's convenient 
for you, Betty!

384
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:16,421
So save your guilt
for someone who cares.

385
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:26,593
# Ladies and gentlemen-- The Dreams! #

386
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:30,633
# We're your dreamgirls #

387
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:33,842
# Boys, we'll make you happy #

388
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,140
# Yeah #

389
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,940
# We're your dreamgirls #

390
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:41,540
# Boys, we'll always care #

391
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:43,572
#  We're your dreamgirls #

392
00:18:43,586 --> 00:18:46,372
# Dreamgirls will never leave you #

393
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:48,010
# Oh #

394
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,020
# And all you have to do is dream #
# baby #

395
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:53,442
# We'll be there... #

396
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:57,710
# Dream whoo! #

397
00:18:57,728 --> 00:19:01,093
# Dreamers will help #
# you through the night #

398
00:19:03,658 --> 00:19:05,761
I wish I hadn't
given up my lessons.

399
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:07,961
I could have been on Broadway.

400
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:10,062
Oh, well, you did date that
chorus boy from "Miss Saigon"

401
00:19:10,097 --> 00:19:11,992
for a while.
That kind of counts.

402
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:13,930
What's your biggest regret?

403
00:19:14,097 --> 00:19:17,693
Drinking a bottle of
champagne on an empty stomach.

404
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:19,352
No, seriously.

405
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:21,982
There's gotta be something
you wish you hadn't given up.

406
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:25,332
Daniel.

407
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:27,922
Oh, sweetie.

408
00:19:27,937 --> 00:19:29,981
Oh, I'm so stupid.

409
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,310
I knew what the rules were.

410
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,550
I didn't mean for it to happen.

411
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:37,633
I just fell in love with him.

412
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:39,401
Me, too.

413
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:40,561
- What?
- What?

414
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:41,872
- Huh?
- Nothing.

415
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:43,240
You look pretty.

416
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:45,052
You wanna try on some Armani?

417
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:54,722
How are you doing, mother?

418
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,961
Adjusting to life
on the outside?

419
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:02,140
I'm on my fourth club soda.
I pee every three minutes.

420
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:03,391
Ah, you'll get through it.

421
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:05,523
Hmm. You know,
I don't think I've ever been

422
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:08,103
to one of your father's
work functions sober.

423
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,140
I always thought there
were twice as many people.

424
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:13,332
Dad.

425
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:14,610
Daniel.

426
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:17,450
Drinking club soda, too?
Very supportive.

427
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:19,203
Happy Thanksgiving.

428
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,531
Happy Thanksgiving.

429
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:29,152
I think it just got
a little happier.

430
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:32,112
Hey, you.

431
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:35,213
You must be Hunter.
I've heard so much about you.

432
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:36,620
I really like that vest.

433
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,782
No, no, I'm Gordon Levine,
editor of "Tech Wiz,"

434
00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:41,062
the 14th floor.

435
00:20:41,078 --> 00:20:42,810
Hunter's over there.

436
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:51,473
Man, how are guys like
us supposed to score

437
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:53,103
with someone like him around?

438
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:05,111
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

439
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:12,553
Martha, it's Wilhelmina.

440
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,622
Oh, hi, Wilhelmina.

441
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:17,423
This is why I should
always screen.

442
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:20,161
So, Martha, happy Thanksgiving.

443
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:22,781
Yeah, yeah, you, too.
Listen, I only have a second.

444
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:25,300
My guests are arriving, and I still
have to hollow out the pumpkins

445
00:21:25,335 --> 00:21:27,322
- for the soup course.
- Sorry to bother you.

446
00:21:27,338 --> 00:21:31,013
- Um, I'm cooking a turkey and--
- You're cooking!

447
00:21:31,027 --> 00:21:33,740
Hey, maybe I could run
a fashion magazine.

448
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:35,913
It'll be like "Freaky Friday."

449
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:39,353
Well, for your information,
I was doing fine until I noticed

450
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:42,903
the bird still had its
luggage inside of it.

451
00:21:46,156 --> 00:21:49,480
Sorry... you want me
to put my hand where?

452
00:21:49,657 --> 00:21:52,483
So then we realized,
it's not a Halloween costume.

453
00:21:52,498 --> 00:21:54,870
He really is a homeless guy.

454
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:57,693
No, and he stole my purse.

455
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:01,691
Yeah, that's funny.

456
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,851
So where did you two
kids meet, anyway?

457
00:22:04,418 --> 00:22:08,282
Aw... on a plane,
coming home from Kenya.

458
00:22:08,296 --> 00:22:10,051
She was there for
a photo shoot,

459
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:11,753
and I was working
with the peace corps.

460
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:14,533
He shared his
complimentary nuts with me,

461
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:18,091
and then he cried when they
showed "Bridget Jones' Diary,"

462
00:22:18,107 --> 00:22:20,271
and I was hooked.

463
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:23,023
So you worked for
the peace corps.

464
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:26,212
Well, I figured there had to
be more to life than modeling

465
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:28,651
and racing sports cars.
Well, you know.

466
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:29,893
Yeah.

467
00:22:29,947 --> 00:22:33,750
Ah. I spent a year setting
up this irrigation pump.

468
00:22:33,968 --> 00:22:38,702
Seeing these tribal kids' faces when
they saw fresh water for the
first time...

469
00:22:38,717 --> 00:22:40,233
Oh, baby.

470
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:41,832
Yeah, I know what you mean.

471
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:45,261
Once, I helped these kids
open up a hydrant on, um,

472
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:49,082
76th street,
and they were just like, "wow."

473
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:10,552
Fey?

474
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:25,030
I saw her just now.
She's alive.

475
00:23:25,185 --> 00:23:28,123
- What are you talking about?
- I saw Fey.

476
00:23:28,135 --> 00:23:30,880
No, you didn't.
She's dead, Bradford.

477
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:33,180
I can't believe you're
doing this to me.

478
00:23:33,198 --> 00:23:37,090
I tried to go after her.
She just... disappeared.

479
00:23:37,235 --> 00:23:39,480
Like some
wishful hallucination.

480
00:23:39,495 --> 00:23:40,632
Are you okay?

481
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:44,492
He's just had too much to drink.
I've got him.

482
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:47,440
Ironic, isn't it?

483
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,700
Hilda thinks I'm jealous?
Why, because for once

484
00:23:50,718 --> 00:23:53,102
she's actually carrying
her weight around here?

485
00:23:53,116 --> 00:23:56,602
I mean, maybe it is time that the family
stopped depending on me for everything.

486
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:59,303
I just asked where I
should put my coat.

487
00:23:59,316 --> 00:24:02,120
I don't know. Ask Hilda.
She knows everything.

488
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:06,160
Run while you can.

489
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,032
Not bad.

490
00:24:15,046 --> 00:24:17,763
Hello? Anyone home?

491
00:24:18,338 --> 00:24:20,352
I'm in the kitchen.

492
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:23,360
The kitchen?

493
00:24:23,377 --> 00:24:25,282
What, did you get
lost or something?

494
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,110
What, are you
staying for a month?

495
00:24:27,126 --> 00:24:28,492
Laundry.

496
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:31,581
The washing machines at
the dorm are skanky.

497
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,961
I'll throw in a load later.

498
00:24:32,977 --> 00:24:35,792
Okay, happy Thanksgiving.
I've gotta run.

499
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:38,083
Wait... run?

500
00:24:38,096 --> 00:24:40,422
I'm meeting Sarah and
Veronica at the concert.

501
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:41,651
What concert?

502
00:24:41,665 --> 00:24:43,351
We're going to see Death
Cab For Cutie at the Beacon.

503
00:24:43,386 --> 00:24:45,332
That's why I came
into the city.

504
00:24:45,346 --> 00:24:47,381
Why, what'd you think?

505
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:51,110
Nothing.

506
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,513
I figured you'd have plans.

507
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:56,633
I mean, you always have plans.

508
00:24:56,647 --> 00:24:57,852
And I do. Of course I do.

509
00:24:57,865 --> 00:25:00,653
I have Donatella's
Thanksgiving party to go to,

510
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,893
which I'm horribly late for.

511
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:06,381
Mom, are you okay?

512
00:25:06,397 --> 00:25:08,331
Nico, I'm fine.

513
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:12,530
I just made a little
snack in case...

514
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:15,660
well, I'm sure it's
not very good, anyway.

515
00:25:15,835 --> 00:25:17,813
I'm gonna go change.

516
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:31,293
Hey, come try these on with me.
If I keep doing it by myself,

517
00:25:31,327 --> 00:25:32,661
then I'm just a freak.

518
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:34,953
You made me think of Daniel.
Now I'm depressed.

519
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:38,072
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't get depressed.

520
00:25:38,088 --> 00:25:40,741
Up, up, up, up, up.
Get up, get up, get up. Up, up, up.

521
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:42,911
I'm gonna tell you a secret.

522
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:46,403
Betty makes $50 a
week less than I do.

523
00:25:46,418 --> 00:25:49,260
Big news. I checked that out 
her first week here.

524
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:50,530
Okay.

525
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:55,951
Joelle from styles got knocked up--
no idea who the father is.

526
00:25:56,595 --> 00:25:58,183
Yeah, okay.

527
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:01,151
I think Wilhelmina's a lesbian.

528
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:02,652
- What?
- A big one.

529
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:04,372
What are you talking about?

530
00:26:04,387 --> 00:26:06,611
Okay. She gets these
calls all the time

531
00:26:06,627 --> 00:26:08,242
from this woman on
her cell phone,

532
00:26:08,258 --> 00:26:09,892
and she always kicks me
out whenever she calls,

533
00:26:09,925 --> 00:26:11,240
and we're like this.

534
00:26:11,258 --> 00:26:13,481
Hell, she even had me bring
her her diaphragm to the plaza

535
00:26:13,518 --> 00:26:15,133
when she was sleeping
with that guy from Texas.

536
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:17,701
So--oh, wait.
There goes my lesbian theory.

537
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,360
So who is this woman?

538
00:26:24,557 --> 00:26:26,061
Oh! My god.

539
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:29,143
The pain is totally gone.

540
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:32,961
- You're amazing!
- I told you.

541
00:26:33,545 --> 00:26:35,903
So are you ready to
get out of here?

542
00:26:35,915 --> 00:26:39,882
Oh, how about we burn some of this
turkey off and go dancing later on?

543
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,331
Well, you know I can't dance.

544
00:26:41,347 --> 00:26:45,032
Oh, come on. Take me to that place
that I love that you never take me to.

545
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:46,633
I can dance.

546
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:47,922
What?

547
00:26:47,935 --> 00:26:50,993
I'm good at dancing.
I love dancing.

548
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:53,781
I think the three of
us should go dancing.

549
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:56,180
I think that's a great idea.

550
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,571
Okay, well, I'm outta here.

551
00:27:01,588 --> 00:27:02,950
Happy turkey day.

552
00:27:02,965 --> 00:27:05,841
Oh, Leah,
thanks again for everything.

553
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:08,803
Now if you need me, I'll be eating
a turkey sandwich at my office,

554
00:27:08,818 --> 00:27:11,891
getting your papers ready to
file for your green card.

555
00:27:12,325 --> 00:27:15,932
You really think if we go to court,
I'll be okay?

556
00:27:15,945 --> 00:27:18,441
I have never lost
a single case yet.

557
00:27:18,455 --> 00:27:21,060
Oh, really?
What about Donna Spadaro?

558
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:22,213
- Betty--
- Excuse me?

559
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:24,611
I'm sorry, Hilda. I cannot just
sit here and watch her lie to us.

560
00:27:24,647 --> 00:27:26,630
- Leah, I am so sorry--
- No, no, it's okay.

561
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,871
So, Betty, what exactly do you
know about Donna Spadaro's case?

562
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:32,181
That you couldn't have won her case,
because you took her money

563
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:33,722
and you disappeared.

564
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:36,080
It's true that I didn't win that case,
because I quit

565
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:38,351
before it ever went to trial.
I wasn't interested in letting

566
00:27:38,387 --> 00:27:41,942
an alcoholic gain
custody of her children.

567
00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:43,973
An alcoholic?

568
00:27:43,985 --> 00:27:46,381
A week before her court date,
Donna Spadaro left her three kids

569
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:49,822
locked in her car in 90-degree heat
while she got bombed in a local bar.

570
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:53,241
The money that I stole from her merely
covered filing and court costs.

571
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,350
But I bet you didn't
hear that part, huh?

572
00:27:56,526 --> 00:27:59,211
No. I didn't.

573
00:27:59,938 --> 00:28:01,280
I'm sorry.

574
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:04,861
Listen, maybe you should find a new
lawyer, one that Betty approves of--

575
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,561
No, no,
you are the lawyer we want.

576
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:10,430
Betty is on some crazy power trip.
This has nothing to do with you.

577
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:12,192
Please, Leah, we need you.

578
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:16,822
Yeah, and you know, you can't have
Thanksgiving dinner at the office.

579
00:28:16,837 --> 00:28:19,231
Why don't you come back tonight
and you have dinner with us?

580
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:20,830
We would love to have you.

581
00:28:22,015 --> 00:28:23,913
Well, it sure beats a sandwich.

582
00:28:23,926 --> 00:28:26,552
You know what? I-I'd like that.

583
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:28,091
Good.

584
00:28:34,786 --> 00:28:37,110
Meet me at the
cemetery tonight.

585
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:41,842
I'm going to find out if she's alive,
one way or the other.

586
00:28:55,806 --> 00:28:58,620
And here was me, afraid that spending
the holiday alone with my cat

587
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,192
was gonna be depressing.

588
00:29:00,317 --> 00:29:02,791
Hilda, it's almost 7:00.

589
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:05,041
Yeah, I know what time it is.

590
00:29:05,056 --> 00:29:07,872
Leah said she'd be here.
She'll be here.

591
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:09,570
Hello?

592
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,862
- It's Daniel.
- Of course it is.

593
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:16,591
Well why would you tell her you
can dance if you can't dance?

594
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:18,261
No, I can dance.
I just didn't know

595
00:29:18,277 --> 00:29:20,502
we were coming to
this kind of club.

596
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:22,480
You gotta teach me.

597
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:25,782
Daniel, I can't teach you
how to salsa on the phone.

598
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:26,833
What am I gonna do?

599
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,550
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, don't panic.

600
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,840
Look, have you ever
even tried to mambo?

601
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:32,282
Oh, yeah. Back in prep school

602
00:29:32,297 --> 00:29:34,762
we had a big mambo
contest every year.

603
00:29:45,205 --> 00:29:48,351
The basic idea of salsa is that the
man is trying to seduce the woman,

604
00:29:48,365 --> 00:29:50,383
and the woman is
pushing him away.

605
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:54,401
So take your left foot,
and you tap on the first beat.

606
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:55,332
My left foot.

607
00:29:55,348 --> 00:29:56,853
Step forward with
the same foot...

608
00:29:56,868 --> 00:29:58,062
Okay, forward...

609
00:29:58,075 --> 00:30:01,051
Rock back on your right,
and bring your left to close.

610
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,092
Back on my right foot,
left to close.

611
00:30:03,107 --> 00:30:05,340
And then you just reverse that,

612
00:30:05,517 --> 00:30:08,523
- just like that.
- On my right foot...

613
00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:10,311
- Yeah.
- I think I could do that.

614
00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:11,811
Look in a mirror.

615
00:30:11,896 --> 00:30:13,861
Are you biting your lower lip?

616
00:30:14,387 --> 00:30:15,323
No.

617
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:17,053
Yes, you are. Don't do that.

618
00:30:20,508 --> 00:30:22,653
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

619
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:47,482
Put... it... down.

620
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:50,261
How does she do that?

621
00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:53,123
She's a little bit of a witch.

622
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:54,793
Give or take a letter.

623
00:31:08,948 --> 00:31:12,102
Oh, hold on. There you are.

624
00:31:12,118 --> 00:31:13,802
- Isn't this place hot?
- Oh, yeah.

625
00:31:13,815 --> 00:31:15,980
It just kinda makes me wanna tap
on the beat with my left foot,

626
00:31:16,015 --> 00:31:18,600
rock back on my right.
Where's Hunter?

627
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,473
He hates it that I
dragged him here.

628
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:22,651
Oh, poor guy.

629
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:25,433
- Can't be great at everything, right?
- Hey, you, come here.

630
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:52,143
I need a mojito,

631
00:31:52,155 --> 00:31:53,693
and then you're next.

632
00:31:58,745 --> 00:32:00,273
What the hell was that?

633
00:32:00,746 --> 00:32:02,422
You told me you were
a lousy dancer.

634
00:32:02,435 --> 00:32:05,292
I am. I was this close to making
the ballroom dancing finals

635
00:32:05,307 --> 00:32:08,393
in Vienna in 1988 and blew
it with my paso doble.

636
00:32:08,408 --> 00:32:09,773
I stink.

637
00:32:13,816 --> 00:32:16,332
I still don't know why the hell
we had to do this tonight.

638
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:18,651
Because I start my
Christmas shopping tomorrow,

639
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:21,562
and I want to know whether I
need to get a gift for Fey.

640
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:27,302
Where the hell's the body?

641
00:32:27,536 --> 00:32:30,731
Save the tired tatrics.
You think I'm an idiot?

642
00:32:30,747 --> 00:32:33,051
You've been working
for her the whole time.

643
00:32:33,065 --> 00:32:34,832
You don't know what
you're talking about.

644
00:32:34,848 --> 00:32:36,323
Where is she?

645
00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:37,781
She's dead.

646
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,571
Have it your way.

647
00:32:40,655 --> 00:32:42,261
What the hell?

648
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:44,052
You told someone about this?

649
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:46,231
Mr. Green is a
recent hire of mine.

650
00:32:46,248 --> 00:32:47,451
To do what?

651
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:49,511
To clean up messes.

652
00:33:06,678 --> 00:33:09,592
I just thought I'd reheat
the gravy since...

653
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:13,533
What's wrong?

654
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:18,340
I just tried Leah's
cell-- twice--

655
00:33:19,017 --> 00:33:21,020
and her office number...

656
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:23,141
all disconnected.

657
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:29,601
Go ahead and say it.

658
00:33:29,846 --> 00:33:31,541
"I told you so."

659
00:33:39,096 --> 00:33:40,891
Get me the hell out of here.

660
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:43,512
Daniel, we need to talk.

661
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:45,922
What, did Hunter just save an
orphan from a burning building?

662
00:33:45,956 --> 00:33:47,540
Forget it.
I'll read about it in the "post"--

663
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:49,380
Come on. Move over.

664
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:52,733
You walked out of
there so upset.

665
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,971
I thought we were
gonna try to--

666
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:10,643
Tell me that doesn't
mean anything.

667
00:34:11,906 --> 00:34:12,870
I can't--

668
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:15,652
Tell me,
and I'll drive away right now.

669
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:18,003
When we pass by each other in the halls,
we can pretend

670
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:19,890
we don't even know each other.

671
00:34:19,906 --> 00:34:21,671
Of course you know
that meant something.

672
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:23,672
Then what are we doing, Sofia?

673
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:26,433
We're not in fifth grade.
Why are you with that guy?

674
00:34:26,448 --> 00:34:28,222
Because I love him,

675
00:34:29,747 --> 00:34:34,142
and this morning,
in his dresser, I found a ring.

676
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,750
Is that what you want?

677
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:38,702
- Yeah.
- Really?

678
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:41,193
Yes.

679
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:46,382
Don't let my motorcycle and
the Gucci sunglasses fool you.

680
00:34:46,396 --> 00:34:48,402
I'm an old-fashioned girl.

681
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:53,811
I want the white picket
fence and lots of babies,

682
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:58,103
and Hunter offers me that.

683
00:34:59,425 --> 00:35:01,123
You...

684
00:35:01,428 --> 00:35:05,050
I don't think you're anywhere
close to being there.

685
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,592
I don't think you
know me that well.

686
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:11,490
Are you telling me that you
are ready to settle down?

687
00:35:15,837 --> 00:35:17,391
Come on, Daniel.

688
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:22,131
This is where you stop me from
walking back into that club.

689
00:35:44,286 --> 00:35:45,480
What's all this?

690
00:35:45,496 --> 00:35:48,312
Well, turns out I don't have to
meet my friends for a while.

691
00:35:48,328 --> 00:35:50,021
Thought I'd have a snack.

692
00:35:50,037 --> 00:35:51,391
You wanna join me?

693
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:53,923
I told you I had plans.

694
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:55,601
Come on. It's Donatella.

695
00:35:55,616 --> 00:35:58,511
There's gonna be seven models
fighting over a celery stick.

696
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,331
Well, I...

697
00:36:01,665 --> 00:36:03,643
suppose I have a minute.

698
00:36:13,948 --> 00:36:16,261
I can't believe you
did all of this.

699
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,682
It was nothing. I just--

700
00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:20,121
Mother.

701
00:36:20,466 --> 00:36:21,882
Stop.

702
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,583
Thank you.

703
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:32,200
So how's everything at that
overpriced boarding school you're at?

704
00:36:32,217 --> 00:36:34,103
Tell me about your classes.

705
00:36:34,115 --> 00:36:37,390
Well, calculus sucks,
but psych is pretty cool.

706
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:39,282
Oh, and I have this
history teacher--

707
00:36:39,295 --> 00:36:41,673
you can have your headphones
in his class, and he...

708
00:36:42,298 --> 00:36:44,672
- What are you doing?
- I'm making the buñuelos.

709
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:48,573
Will you stop with those things?
Leah stole our money.

710
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:51,782
We can't even go to the police because
we can't tell them dad's illegal.

711
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:53,980
It's still Thanksgiving, Hilda,
and we're still a family,

712
00:36:54,017 --> 00:36:55,940
and I'm making mom's dessert.

713
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,970
I can't believe
I was so stupid.

714
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:01,801
I should've checked her out.

715
00:37:02,015 --> 00:37:03,851
It could happend to anybody.

716
00:37:03,985 --> 00:37:06,210
A lot of people
believed her story.

717
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:07,960
We're just so desperate,

718
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:10,893
and I wanted to come through 
for once, you know?

719
00:37:10,915 --> 00:37:12,880
To be the big hero.

720
00:37:14,418 --> 00:37:16,641
Well, you can help
me finish these.

721
00:37:19,057 --> 00:37:20,343
Fine.

722
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:26,432
You know,
if anyone's to blame, it's me.

723
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:27,933
- Oh, shut up.
- I'm serious.

724
00:37:27,948 --> 00:37:28,943
I'm gonna hit you.

725
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:30,891
At least you've been
trying to help.

726
00:37:30,906 --> 00:37:33,023
I didn't make it to
Justin's pageant.

727
00:37:33,037 --> 00:37:35,051
I mean, maybe this stupid job 
isn't worth it.

728
00:37:35,065 --> 00:37:38,653
Well, you can't live your
life for your family, Betty.

729
00:37:39,448 --> 00:37:42,143
You've been taking care
of us since mom died,

730
00:37:42,158 --> 00:37:46,160
and maybe it's time for us to
stop relying on you so much.

731
00:37:49,006 --> 00:37:51,411
Well, I like it that
you rely on me.

732
00:37:51,428 --> 00:37:54,821
Taking care of the family is
the one thing I knew I could do.

733
00:37:55,216 --> 00:37:57,760
I wasn't ever gonna
be the pretty one.

734
00:37:58,665 --> 00:38:00,491
Okay, look.

735
00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:02,731
Maybe you don't have to
take care of everything.

736
00:38:02,745 --> 00:38:04,823
Maybe we're stronger
than we think.

737
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:07,730
Hell, I put these nails
in stuffing today.

738
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:10,690
Big deal.

739
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:14,030
Ay. I'm gonna kick your butt.

740
00:38:15,677 --> 00:38:18,212
- I'm not gonna answer that.
- It's okay.

741
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:20,350
Tell Daniel I said hi.

742
00:38:30,728 --> 00:38:32,030
Here it is.

743
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:34,633
I found it--
her cell phone bill.

744
00:38:34,957 --> 00:38:36,052
That's the number!

745
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:38,361
2:00 a.m. 6:00 in the morning.

746
00:38:40,658 --> 00:38:42,541
I can't believe
you're doing this.

747
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,013
Wilmont Surgical Center.

748
00:38:46,026 --> 00:38:48,612
Hi. This is Wilhelmina Slater.

749
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:51,153
Yes, Ms. Slater.
I'll put you right through.

750
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,311
She's putting me through.

751
00:38:52,328 --> 00:38:54,901
- Through to who?
- I have no idea.

752
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:03,001
Why are you calling
me from the office?

753
00:39:05,266 --> 00:39:07,613
She knows we called
from the office.

754
00:39:24,617 --> 00:39:25,842
Yes?

755
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,630
Why did you just hang up on me?

756
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:29,662
I didn't.

757
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:31,101
Well, someone did,

758
00:39:31,115 --> 00:39:34,201
and they were calling
from your office.

759
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:44,290
Excuse me.

760
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:46,052
Hi, I'm Betty.
Somebody called me.

761
00:39:46,065 --> 00:39:48,400
Yeah, that was me.
He's over there.

762
00:39:49,646 --> 00:39:50,662
Is he okay?

763
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:53,103
Well, he was ordering scotch rocks
for a while, and then when he started

764
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:56,092
ordering "crotch socks," I
figured I'd call someone, so...

765
00:39:56,106 --> 00:39:58,790
Yours was the number dialed in his
cell the most, so I just figured...

766
00:39:58,825 --> 00:40:00,151
Thanks.

767
00:40:06,778 --> 00:40:07,910
Hi.

768
00:40:07,928 --> 00:40:10,410
Betty. Hey.

769
00:40:10,537 --> 00:40:13,501
I wore that purple shirt
you picked out for me.

770
00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:15,342
Your shirt looks great.

771
00:40:15,735 --> 00:40:17,572
Do you wanna get out of here?

772
00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:21,612
I didn't tell her what
she wanted to hear, Betty.

773
00:40:22,606 --> 00:40:25,010
It wasn't a very
good Thanksgiving.

774
00:40:27,045 --> 00:40:28,322
Yeah.

775
00:40:28,335 --> 00:40:31,042
I didn't have a very good
Thanksgiving, either.

776
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,582
Come on.

777
00:40:48,256 --> 00:40:49,880
No!

778
00:40:50,045 --> 00:40:51,683
Let me out of here!

779
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:54,410
Let me out of here!

780
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,583
No!

781
00:40:56,596 --> 00:40:58,540
Let me out!

782
00:40:58,995 --> 00:41:01,023
Let me out of here!

783
00:41:01,145 --> 00:41:02,811
No!

784
00:41:03,936 --> 00:41:05,511
Let me out!

785
00:41:05,895 --> 00:41:07,540
Let me out!
