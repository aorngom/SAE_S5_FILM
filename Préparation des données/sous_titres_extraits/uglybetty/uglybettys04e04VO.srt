1
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,750
Aww, look at them.All nervous

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,420
I remember when I interviewed
to be your assistant

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,330
So that's group HR sent me, huh?

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,350
I only talked to them for a
little while. I really like Galvin

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,440
Which one is he?

6
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,370
I don't want to do the interview today.

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,270
I am starting to feel crazy

8
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,520
maybe,because you're eating

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,520
chocolate covered pretzel for breakfast

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,070
Thanks I almost eat the whole bag

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,860
See.Which one of those
goophers is gonna do that for me

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,650
Hey,not too long ago, I
was one of those goophers

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,850
All right. Promise me
you will pick someone good

14
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,430
I promise

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,000
Good Do you need anything else?

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,070
Actually, fact checking. I know you...

17
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,050
Come on,what kind of editor would I be

18
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,550
if I can't do a little fact checking.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,850
Add to my file

20
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,700
All of it by two o'clock?

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,510
No problem

22
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,140
Wow, that's a lot reading.

23
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,660
But I am happy you let me do it.

24
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,840
Japanese to English?

25
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,260
I look forward to the challenge.

26
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,130
Wow, look at that giant pile.

27
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,490
I know. It is carrying all those papers

28
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,890
Igoring and rising above

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,240
What's wrong, Betty? Now
you are a big fancy editor

30
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,660
and you don't even talk
to the little people

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,040
Oh,I am sorry. I couldn't
hear you over your flash shirt

32
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,680
- Did you just... 
- Fashion is my best Suarez.

33
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,810
Unexpected

34
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,650
Unlike you, Betty.I look
great in jewel tones.

35
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
What's the tude?

36
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,060
I tried to be nice to you.

37
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,370
But since my promotion,

38
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,370
all you do is insult
you and sabotage me.

39
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,500
So I am done with you.

40
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,810
I really like the side of her

41
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,420
Do you mind?

42
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,660
- Sorry. 
- No no it's my bad.

43
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,130
Here, let me help you.

44
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,340
I was wondering if you
have any feature ideas

45
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,340
for the New York issue

46
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,650
What? You mean to write a article?

47
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,490
Yeah, unless you are too busy...

48
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,030
Oh no no I would love
to write an article.

49
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,330
Actually, I am working
on this concept about

50
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,110
the unsung heros of New York.

51
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,890
People who do the toughest jobs

52
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,070
and we can showcase their
uniforms for fashion lingo.

53
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,440
New York's 10 most thankness jobs.

54
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,780
Sounds perfect

55
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,550
Really?

56
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,310
Wow,thanks.Ok,great

57
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,070
Well I will get to work.

58
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,790
Oh Matt,I am really glad that we...

59
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,790
- you know. 
- Yeah, me too.

60
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,670
Oh hey Matt.

61
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,640
I really like your haircut.

62
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,230
Just looks so healthy.

63
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,770
Make me wanna pull it.

64
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,670
haha..Actually,I didn't get a haircut.

65
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,270
Ow,wow,that kinda hurt.Thank you.

66
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,580
Bye

67
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,540
my god,Mandy.You are five
minutes away flipping his arms

68
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,680
and lying him down on the desk.

69
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,640
Hww, you love him

70
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,010
Please. He is tainted.

71
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,470
Kissing him is like kissing Betty.

72
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,960
Betty.yes.Daniel is looking for you.

73
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,710
He wants you to meet the new assistant.

74
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,480
Ohh,he picked someone. Is it Galvin£¿

75
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,990
I don't think so.

76
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,290
Hi

77
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,330
Are you Daniel's new assistant?

78
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,660
Lexi .like sexy

79
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,100
Oh I see.

80
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,390
I am Betty,

81
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,830
like confetti.

82
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,490
I am Daniel's older assistant.

83
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,820
I am more than happy to help you.

84
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,650
I can show you how things work.

85
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,130
I know how things work.

86
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,330
I am sure you will be fine.

87
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,460
Hey Betty.

88
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,160
Did you meet Lexi yet?

89
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,690
Lexi,like sexy?

90
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,730
Yes, we met.

91
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,940
- Daniel.
- What?

92
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,530
What happened to Galvin?

93
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,910
Of all the people HR sent over,

94
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,160
that's who you picked.

95
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,550
Looks like nothing to do...with it.

96
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,090
I can't believe you even think that.

97
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,410
I am a widower, Betty

98
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,680
You certainly didn't pick
her because she's friendly

99
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,870
Maybe she is intimidated by you.

100
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,230
I told her she has some
pretty big shoes to fill.hmm

101
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,690
She nailed the interview,

102
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,660
totally helpful.

103
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,890
Let me get that for you.

104
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,450
Just cause she's pretty doesn't
mean she is not qualified.

105
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,090
You'd know judging a book
by its cover works both ways.

106
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,560
I am sure if you think she is
capable, then she will be great.

107
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,430
Where the hell have you been?

108
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,950
Can I go out to get some frozen yogurt?

109
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,920
If you can go a couple weeks
not murdering any boyfriends

110
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,310
Did you talk to anyone?

111
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,970
You know me,just get
one frozen yogurt in me,

112
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,940
I just tell all my sercret

113
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,350
Is this a joke to you?

114
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,980
You will not be laughing when
we're both in jail,young lady.

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,210
Mum,it was twenty minutes.

116
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,010
I asked you to do one thing.

117
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,980
Nicole,after everything
I've done for you.

118
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,100
Boarding school in France,

119
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,050
taking you in when you needed help.

120
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,420
I am sorry.

121
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,040
It won't happen again.

122
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,920
You're right.It won't happen again.

123
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,840
Because from now on,

124
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,030
you don't leave my sight.

125
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,560
That's it.Now,you type in
your password right there.

126
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,290
That's how you check your email

127
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,250
So,what's my password again?

128
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,280
Ignaciorules.

129
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,450
Just want to hear you say that.

130
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,440
Hey,look at that.

131
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,610
Guess papi is more
modern than you thought

132
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,130
Yes,congratulations.You
have mastered emails.

133
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,110
Welcome to 1993.

134
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,180
Hey,I think it's very cool

135
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,180
that you are learning
to use the computer.

136
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,680
You are in the mood.

137
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,920
What? It's Archie.

138
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,580
I never get to see him anymore.

139
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,260
He is busy campaigning and
canvassing the neighborhood.

140
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,170
I will tell you one
neighborhood he is not canvassing

141
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,180
if you know what I mean

142
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,720
What? It's passion.

143
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,330
Without it,every relationship fails.

144
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,830
I don't want that happen to us.

145
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,840
Maybe, he is not
attractive to me anymore

146
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,860
What? Are you crazy? Look at you.

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,550
Yeah,that would be pretty crazy.

148
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,280
mija, more coffee?

149
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,410
you'll gonna be more full all night.

150
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,360
so i'm gonna only make it through.

151
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,950
i have all these work to do,

152
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,770
and i haven't even started
writing my own article.

153
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,790
just have the people below you do it.

154
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,110
isn't any editors to do?

155
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,470
justin, i'm a junior editor,

156
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,320
there is no one below
me in my department.

157
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,360
there is always someone lower than you.

158
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,500
in junior high, the drama
kids seem like the foodchain

159
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,450
there is always the band,
and the vanason fair nervous

160
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,640
i like the Vanason's fair

161
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,030
i was one of the queen's dancers.

162
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,680
so, betty

163
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,950
who is below you?

164
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,750
there is a pour of assistants
that junior editors can use.

165
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,370
but i don't want, i
can handle my own work.

166
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,710
mija, it is not a sign of
weakness to ask for help.

167
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,070
mage, i know you hate your life,

168
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,170
but does everything you
pick up have to be so drary?

169
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,410
don't come back until you get it right.

170
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,070
great pep talk, everyone
looked really scary.

171
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,670
hey, willie, can i talk
to you about something?

172
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,410
i just ran up for Paul from style,

173
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,060
he is good authorities from gay rany

174
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,020
oh, just say it.

175
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,790
hartley and claire were having dinner

176
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,790
with Isabell last night.

177
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,030
were they just planning to replace you.

178
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,550
what are we gonna do?
what's the plan? blackmail?

179
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,370
i've been trying to get
dirt on Isabell for years,

180
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,020
she has cleaned up as a vessel.

181
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,320
then what?

182
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,980
hartley and claire are your enemy.

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,870
marc

184
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,800
we'll just have to convince
them that i'm not their enemy.

185
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,960
remind them that i'm a team player.

186
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,420
you're serious?

187
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,500
yes, i can turn on the charm if i want.

188
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,870
1 time shaky ground wouldn't
kill me to kiss claire's ass

189
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,130
so, your plan is

190
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,880

191
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,600

194
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,540
you can hatch up something else.

195
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,480
speak of things,

196
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,640
when you hatched,

197
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,760
nico is here.

198
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,280

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,390

201
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,380
so, nico, what you've been doing

202
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,780

203
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,870
Wilhemina

204
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,440
i'm sorry to interrupt.

205
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,560
don't be sorry, being sorry takes time.

206
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,680
just put it down.

207
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,790
well, i've requested an
assistant from the pull,

208
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,690
but HR says you have
to sign off one of them.

209
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,930
but you never stay with
your mom for this long,

210
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,320
is there a boy trouble?

211
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,030
don't you meet some guy
back packing for you?

212
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,670
so what happened to him?

213
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,500
you need an assistant? Done.

214
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,570

217
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,530

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,500

222
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,330

223
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,950
and you are it.

***********

230
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,560
i can not be betty's assistant.

231
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,470
it goes against the
nature order of things.

232
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,010
she, she is ridiculous.

233
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,380
i've made my decision, marc.

234
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,570
is this because i told you about

235
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,570
the french editor who
might be replacing you?

236
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,560
do not punish the messager, willie.

237
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,890
it's a good learning experience
for nico to the manner desk

238
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,680
besides, you are always to complain that

239
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,680
you are more editorial responsibility

240
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,270
and betty needs help in the feature

241
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,150
i'm..., you know what, i

242
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,720
i can do this by myself.

243
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,200
betty, you might be a star assistant,

244
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,470
but as an editor,

245
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,970
you'll fail to produce one
single item for this magazine.

246
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,540
you want help? here it is.

247
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,040
and don't worry about it.

248
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,340
betty is in charge, shut up and get out.

249
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,470
i said get out.

250
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,560
very amateur.

251
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,730
just because i'm your
temporary assistant

252
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,760
does not mean i'm getting
you coffee. got it?

253
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,190
i could be an editor in V.

254
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,160
V?

255
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,160
a certain magazine whose name
shall't be said reins for vogue

256
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,290
Donting.Ally Junior
himself offer me a job.

257
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,070
Donting.Ally Junior a man so fabulous

258
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,500
he was in cafeteria everyday
and i said, "no, thanks."

259
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,090
i'd rather be in mode being
assistant of Betty Suarez

260
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,750
you know what, marc, this
is awkward for me, too.

261
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,320
but i could actually use your help.

262
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,340
by need to tremohunt your
words from trends column

263
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,670
maybe you could help me with that.

264
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,280
i could do that after my sleep.

265
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,230
hey, lexy, i'm gonna
pop down to cafeteria

266
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,530

267
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,940
i'm on the phone.

268
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,190
what was you saying?

269
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,430
ok, anyway, i'll be back in an hour, ok?

270
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,140
sorry, my new boss, yelled
at me about something.

271
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,500
mother, could you just
take off your sun-glasses?

272
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,820
it's so embarrassing.

273
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,520
i can't believe that
you drag me down here.

274
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,490
kind of sad people eating cafeteria

275
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,400
hello, hello.

276
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,540
Wilhemina

277
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,800
well, well, it's your girl over here.

278
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,030
would you please? thank you.

279
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,640
claire, what a nice surprise.

280
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,300
this is my daughter nico.

281
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,440
hello, nico.

282
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,850
it's nice to meet you, dear.

283
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,100
surprise to see you down, Wilhemina.

284
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,860
eating our monster cominer

285
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,280
you're too funny.

286
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,340
I would bust wave i
have had the moral mood

287
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,780
could we talk about
business for just a minute?

288
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,200
we like the new york issue,

289
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
but we are a little
concerned about the sales.

290
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,450
now cal has an idea.

291
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,270
So try to keep up your ears on this.

292
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,380
Get on, your old bags.

293
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,670
every book or movie I see these
days are all about vampires.

294
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,080
It's a total cash call.

295
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,230
Now, what if we put a
vampire on the cover of mode.

296
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,850
you've got be kidding me.

297
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,150
So the New York theme
becomes gothic gotham

298
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,230
Keep the fashion, but give
our covergirl some fans.

299
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,670
worst I did ever

300
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,010
Oh, wait, it's my turn to talk.

301
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,030
I love it.

302
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,690
you do?

303
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,180
Cal and I thought we might get you

304
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,040
some push back on this.

305
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,730
I know a great idea when I hear one.

306
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,400
Wilhemina Slater is and
will always be a team player.

307
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,890
I am crazy for catalufa

308
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,150
Do you love them?

309
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,580
I don't know, thank you for the feeding

310
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,710
Here is the way to be good in mode.

311
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,030
you know what?

312
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,360
yeah.

313
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,670
I've been getting here the
guy give the inspiritional hot

314
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,470
I don't know.

315
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,690
He is kind of great

316
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,570
He teaches us about how
co-operate with staff,

317
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,150
and divorce.

318
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,420
If you're curious.

319
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,730
He actually talked this afternoon.

320
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,440
About losing loved ones.

of your lives, and so on.

323
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,060
I think it's chasing,
in this region. I know.

324
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,890
Forget the book slogan.

325
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,830
It's really been helping
you work through some stuff.

326
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,330
Ok, you just scoffed at me.

327
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,780
No, I am not scoffing at you.

328
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,180
Whatever, you know what? Never mind.

329
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,550
You're not ready for it, anyway.

330
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,440
You want to make me think I'm not ready.

331
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,760
Of course, I'm ready. Besides,

332
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,340
What can it hurt, right?

333
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,290
Right.

335
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,810
- Hi, Hilda. 
- Shuu.

336
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,510
Hi. Do you remember that Halloween

337
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,020
When I was the sexiest super hero?

338
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,770
Remember how those guys were groping?

339
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,070
Yes, that was the
year when he's the D.A.

340
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,060
Oh, yeah. That was sad.

341
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,490
Anyway, where are the sexy boots.

342
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:06,940
Why?

343
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,940
I'm gonna take Archie a
sexy picture of myself.

344
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,210
You know, put a little
envy on his sides.

345
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,150
Hilda.

346
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,710
Sexy?

347
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,920
What, please!

348
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,980
Sound like I'm gonna be nude.

349
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,090
It's gonna be a
tasteful picture by then.

350
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,190
I'm not giving away
the whole basket, Betty.

351
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,470
Just the nice cleavage.

352
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,390
Classic. The boots are on
the attic, I gona go, bye.

353
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,330
Bye.

354
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,740
While you're on your personal call,

355
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,180
I finished the trends column.

356
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,150
You cut the whole end row?

357
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,130
You know what, I don't miss it.

358
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,170
Good idea.

359
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,880
Great idea.

360
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,870
What?

361
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:47,870
Nothing.

362
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,640
It's just bad that

363
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,750
I have to watch you
getting promoted above me

364
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,710
Without having any knowledge of fashion.

365
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,190
Well, now, I have your
attitude eruption on my face.

366
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:56,910
You know what, Marc.

367
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,630
I'm not going to keep having
this argument with you.

368
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,510
I know I'm not perfect,

369
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,130
But Daniel and Wilhemina
paid me for a reason.

370
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,480
Yeah, Daniel's name is on the building.

371
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,800
And you two are lovers.

372
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,950
You know I have had the mind

373
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,590
To march into Daniel's office right now.

374
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,360
And put this issue to
rest in once for all.

375
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,080
I would love to see
the look on your face,

376
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,490
When Daniel says they gave me the job,

377
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,380
Because they thought I would
be a better editor than you.

378
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,690
Okay. I would love to
hear him say those words.

379
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,640
Fine!

380
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,420
Fine!

381
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,890
No. Er, you both so
qualified, with some...

382
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,940
Just give us the truth.

383
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,630
You have voted trumpt
to Wilhemina. Right?

384
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,550
Because you're a Mead.

385
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,600
Or was it simply that I had
more potential as an editor.

386
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,600
It was a  very hard
decision for us to make.

387
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,360
Why are you so caring
their feelings, Daniel?

388
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,130
We tossed a coin.

389
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,030
And you got your job, Betty.
Because you were tails.

390
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,370
You know, I wanted you in this job.

391
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,940
The coin-toss was the only
way to break through in-path.

392
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,610
No, I know.

393
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,580
It's just the only way keeping
me going was the feeling

394
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,250
That I actually deserved this.

395
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,610
Betty, wait.

396
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,090
You do deserve this.

397
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,410
Believe me.

398
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,540
Yeah, I know, I know.

399
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,860
Good.

400
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,220
Look, I have to run
to my layout meeting.

401
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,580
Are you sure you're gonna be all right?

402
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,290
Yeah. Yes.

403
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,030
Right.

404
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,750
Hi, tails. I'm so happy
to be cleared like that.

405
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,460
You're not better than
me. You're just lucky.

406
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,560
You're nothing more than
tails, the badges of a quarter.

407
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,810
Hi, guys.

408
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,560
- Betty, how's your article going? 
- Great.

409
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,300
I've already set up
a bunch of interviews

410
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,390
With some of the toughest
working people in the city

411
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,190
And I'm going down
there to see first ten.

412
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,770
Great. And while you are down there,

413
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,410
Why don't you see if they
actually do some of the jobs?

414
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,380
Oh, ok. Like the first person in place.

415
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,380
Yeah. And you should wear
all those humiliating clother

416
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,830
That they wear and
take a lot of pictures

417
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,030
For the document and whole thing.

418
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,980
You got a great idea. Marc.

419
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,580
See, some people just
don't think like an editor.

420
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,870
Can you get my messages for me, please?

421
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,120
Thank you.

422
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,650
Hello, Mr. candidate.

423
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,820
Did you get the picture
that I sent to you.

424
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,090
Yes, I got. And so did everyone else.

425
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,820
What?

426
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,340
You hit "Reply all to my
campaign emails". Hilda.

427
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,010
- That's put into my entire district list. 
- Oh, my god.

428
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,150
Hilda. This is the
absolutely worst thing

429
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,030
That could happen at
this point of my campaign.

430
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,590
Archie, Archie.

431
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,520
I got an email.

432
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,610
Archie, you gonna get those emails back.

433
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,780
I was not that decent.

434
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,250
I can't get it back.

435
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,960
And now everyone including
the kids I volunteered with

436
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,190
Was opening their emails

437
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,800
And find a picture of your boobs.

438
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,580
Ignaciorules

439
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,250
I can't talk, right now.
Just meet me later, ok?

440
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,370
Ok.

441
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,630
I got something from you.

442
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,700
It's a picture.

443
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,570
Where are my reading glasses?

444
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,610
No.

445
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,700
Hi, Lexy. How about a cup of coffee?

446
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,310
Oh, yeah. I love one, thanks.

447
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,260
Oh, er, ok.

448
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,910
Finished your fact checking

449
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,710
Thanks.

450
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,110
So, you're getting her a coffee now?

451
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,060
You know what,

452
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,560
I don't think it's working
out so well with Lexy

453
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,520
Which is weird

454
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,400
Because I'm usually such
a good judge character?

455
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Yeah.

456
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,720
I picked you, didn't I?

457
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,190
No, not exactly. Your father picked me.

458
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,060
Precisely, so that you
wouldn't do which you always do

459
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,580
Which is hiring an assistant
who you wanted to sleep with.

460
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,890
Right.

461
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,560
Is that why you hired me?

462
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,470
Hi, Lexy

463
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,590
You disgusting.

464
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
No, no. No.

465
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,180
Oh, my god. I didn't
know she was right there.

466
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,850
Do you want me to go
and say something to her?

467
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,730
No, you're busy.

468
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,790
My problem.

469
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,240
I can handle it.

470
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,210
Lexy

471
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,720
I really need to appologize to you.

472
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,380
You heard something out of that context.

473
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,720
And I really wanted you to know

474
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,240
That's not the reason I hired you.

475
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,010
And I promise you,

476
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,690
The more you get to know
me, the more you realise

477
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,620
I'm just not like that. Ok?

478
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,740
What is wrong with you?

479
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,860
- No, no, no.
- You think you can just grab me?

480
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,580
No, that was an accident.

481
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,800
I was just trying to
reach for your shoulder.

482
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,270
You, dirty old man.

483
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,400
No, no. I'm sorry. Lexy, I'm sorry.

484
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,240
Wait.

485
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,540
Old?

486
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,700
What...

487
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,710
Tails.

488
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,020
Would you just stop doing that?

489
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,630
Come on.

490
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,300
It's time for you to do ten
worst jobs in New York city.

491
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,650
Mr. Beckluney? Hi.

492
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,280
Hi, I am Betty Suarez,
we spoke on the phone.

493
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,320
I'm here to be your hotdog rolesters.

494
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,120
Taj ma hot dog.

495
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,080
Delicious meat substitude
hotdogs. Sounds tasty.

496
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,960
Thank you.

497
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,310
I knows it is not chilly day

498
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,790
But can get my disticking hot dog suit

499
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,940
I am sorry, but there's
actual hot dog suit?

500
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,010
Oh, I just thought today
wouldn't get sweeter.

501
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,880
No, which one of you
going to be the wena?

502
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
Which one is going to be the bun?

503
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,650
What?

504
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,760
Two men costume. You can't
have a wena without a bun?

505
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,920
Woa. You are the man

506
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,480
No. You wear the stupid costume.

507
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,160
Your article; you are the editor.

508
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,000
You are right.

509
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,630
Marc. I am the editor.

510
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,820
I¡®ve been doing the hardest
job in New York all day long.

511
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,250
You have been doing nothing at all.

512
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,990
But your Wilhemina make me in charge.

513
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,920
So suit up, cause I am the
boss, and you are the bun.

514
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,610
Woa, what do you think?

515
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,610
You look great.

516
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,680
But please don't eat
it front the customers.

517
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,420
A hot dog eating a hot
dog. It freaks them out.

518
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,260
Ok. What do I do?  Treat
customers, hand out them coupon

519
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,390
It doesn't seem so hard.

520
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,820
Sometimes it happens.

521
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,230
Now where is my bun?

522
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,360
Bun, we need you.

523
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,980
Can have a hot dog without a bun?

524
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,250
Ah, there you are.

525
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,780
Unlike you betty

526
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,500
Whoever rediculous getup
some of daily bases.

527
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,760
I have a reputation to protect.

528
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,940
Come on, Marc you look
adorable. Gonna have a eat.

529
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,340
What the hell is that?

530
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,090
Was the hot dog music.

531
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,970
Come on I show you the dance dance.

532
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,500
Still doesn't read vampires.

533
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,960
Maybe sharper fangs

534
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,640
Maybe we should add some blood
to the front of the dress.

535
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,830
Oh I agree. Good idea. Claire.

536
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,340
Don't you dare.

537
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,400
Oh Nico. What are you doing?

538
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,920
It wasn't on purpose.

539
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,650
Don't you have blood on your hands?

540
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,720
Mom do not get all pissed with me,

541
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,290
Because you hate the vampire idea

542
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,070
God, it is not my fault.

543
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,000
Actually it is. I am
hanging on by a thread.

544
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
doing everything again to keep my job

545
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,510
That is because my job can
help you. It's all for you.

546
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,410
So I am making nice.

547
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,410
Even though this vampire
shoot is rediculous.

548
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,610
Rediculous?

549
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,680
What happen to loveing the concept?

550
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,910
I do. I am 100% on board.

551
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,300
Team player.

552
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,140
We ran the idea by you because

553
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,640
we want your blunt opinions.

554
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,440
Well. How the hell I supposed
to give my honest opinion?

555
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,430
Kowning that Isabelle
can replace me any minute.

556
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,190
I have the feeling that you
might have heard about that.

557
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,550
You want to know the truth.

558
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,450
Yes.

559
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,040
This is juvernier

560
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,220
You put this on the cover,
and is damaging the brand.

561
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,760
Mode is not followed
trends. We set them.

562
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,140
All right.

563
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,350
I'll talk to Kale.

564
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
You're agreeing with me?

565
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
And now you do something for me.

566
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,910
Drop the budget. Start by
cutting 10 pages contents.

567
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:49,240
Oh, Wilhemina, just do your
job while you still have it.

568
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,590
OK, 5, 6, 7, 8

569
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,480
Eat me, I am a hot dog.

570
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,340
Can I always buy?

571
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,540
Time to eat the greatest chicken

572
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,140
As much I love giant wena flying at me.

573
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,520
This is the loop
outside my comfort zone.

574
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,690
You don't try to catch me. Marc

575
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,580
It is not my fault. You can't count.

576
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,200
You were too foolish early.

577
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,320
Oh no, I can't count.

578
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
No you can't count, you can't dance.

579
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Certainly you can't edit
the fashion magazine.

580
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,990
What is it with you? Marc

581
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,430
You know at the point
we've just gone at the way

582
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,070
If you had been promoted, .

583
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,100
I would have just been happy for you

584
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,910
Why can't you just be happy for me?

585
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,420
Why should I be happy for you?

586
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,080
Of course the coin landed on you

587
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,910
You like the luckiest
person on the world

588
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,880
You have a great job, great family

589
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,880
Multiple attractive
man wanna to date you

590
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,230
God knows why.

591
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,830
I can't catch a break.

592
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,760
I am always the bun.

593
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,810
Come on Marc. It is not that bad.

594
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,320
Don't happy pity me

595
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,930
You wanna a top thinkless
job  in New Yok city.

596
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,160
Try being Wilhemina
Slater's goofer for 5 years

597
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,310
Let's put on this.

598
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,150
I could be the editor at the magazine

599
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,350
whose name shall not be mentioned.

600
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,410
I could be a photoshelf

601
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:16,410
to the most fashionable
man in publishing

602
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,100
My style icon Donting.Ally Junior

603
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,550
Yes?

604
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,860
You grab her boob?

605
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,610
No, I didn't grab her.
I sort of greaze it

606
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,610
Daniel

607
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,940
It was an accident. I
was going to apologize.

608
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,160
I don't care how bad
the assistant she is.

609
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,690
If you grab gread it and
look sideway at that boob.

610
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,690
You can't fire her.

611
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,670
You have a big lost on you head.

612
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,000
I am so so sorry

613
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,990
I feel terrible about this.

614
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,140
The last thing I wanna do was hurt you.

615
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,070
-I just, I didn't think.  
-This is why. Hilda. You didn't think.

616
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,810
I know you don't mean
this to be happened.

617
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,130
But you know what photo like
this to do to the campain?

618
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,170
This is a big embarrassment for me.

619
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,210
Nobody could be as
embarrassed about this as me.

620
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,190
It's my picture people
are talking about.

621
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,370
Well then why did you do it?

622
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,160
You have been so busy lately.
I just want us to be closer.

623
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,700
You know I want you to be
exciting about us again.

624
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,610
I am sorry if I am embarrassing you

625
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,720
Ah. I am surprised you remember me.

626
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,060
Of course I do.

627
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,960
It is not often someone
refused a job from us.

628
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,160
But you said you have
to pursue your dream

629
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,620
Which apparently is selling hot dogs?

630
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,700
Oh no I don't work here.

631
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,290
I am still at Mode

632
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,580
They finally made you editor?

633
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,860
Ah still pick Wilhemina
Slater dry cleaning.

634
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,330
Actually Marc is so
valuable at Mode that

635
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,190
We just got him at
the feature department.

636
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,310
We are doing a story right now

637
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,890
The hardest job in New York

638
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,520
That's why wearing this crazy costumes

639
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:06,980
Features.

640
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,400
Good for you, congratulations

641
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,580

with upcoming young editors

642
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,180
Brunch? sometimes?

643
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,580
Have your assistant editor

644
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,920
Acctually, she is not...

645
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,390
I would be happy to

646
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,110
You don't have to do that

647
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,900
I know

648
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,530
Thanks

649
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,110
I just figured you'll
do for a change in luck

650
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,440
It's you

651
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,850
Emergency editor's meeting at 4 p.m

652
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,150
That's in senven minutes

653
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,980
Well...we have to get back to the office

654
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,010
I'll get the cab

655
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,380
You go back to tarjema
and get back our cloths

656
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,220
Hey...hold the door, thank you

657
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,630
Come on, hurry, where are my cloths?

658
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,040
um...

659
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,690
I might have accidentally trashed them

660
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,200
What?

661
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,460
In my defense, i was sort
of hating you at the time

662
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:03,640
Here, let me...

663
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,520
Don't help me

664
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,720
- Betty, don't be like that 
- you know,every single time

665
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,000
I think there is a glimmer of

666
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,490
A decent person in there

667
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,170
You always seem to prove me wrong

668
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:14,650
And now, i have go back to
the office just like a hot dog

669
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,170
Where everybody all
already thinks i am a joke

670
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,490
Thank you

671
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,890
Close the door, please.

672
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,860
Why do we have to

673
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,990
Accept that our loved ones are gone

674
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,190
They are with us, always

675
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,840
And if we deny that

676
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,750
It will only prolong our pain

677
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,540
So I say reject acceptance

678
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,970
You don't agree with me?

679
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,590
You don't want to be here, do you?

680
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,600
No, he doesn't

681
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,010
Yes, i do

682
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,120
I'm offering you a

683
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,600
Chance and elevated relationship
with someone you lost

684
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,730
But you can only achieve that connection

685
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,200
When you are honest with
yourself about what you want

686
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,150
And you can't be honest with me

687
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,760
Or can you?

688
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,100
Do you wanna be here?

689
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,830
Fine, i don't want to be here

690
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,210
Congratulations

691
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,500
You just healed part of yourself

692
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,000
You are scough at that?

693
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,610
I wasn't scoughing

694
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,020
He was, he was scoughing

695
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,160
He has been doing it all day

696
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,250
Just stop it,

697
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,320

698
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,660
Fine...yes...i was scoughing

00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,520
Come on. honesty heels? i mean...

700
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,150
Don't you think it sounds
a little simplistic?

701
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:55,670
people has always underestimated
the powper of simplicity

702
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,070
Tell you what

703
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,210
Go and  try being
hornest in your daily life

704
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,170
Exactly when you think you shouldn't be

705
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,080
And if i am right

706
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,790
It frees you up in some way

707
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,770
Come back, if it doesn't...fine

708
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,000
Except that person you loved

709
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,290
Is gone forever

710
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,850

711
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,480

Its just the hot dog suit,

717
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,910
do you know whether editor's
meeting have started yet?

718
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,080
Amanda?

719
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,050
Have you seen...um...Betty?

720
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,660
Betty?

721
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,320
Listen

722
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,580
Wilhemina is cutting ten
pages of content for budget

723
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,170
Everyone is fighting to keep their staff

724
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,570
That is ridiculous

725
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,360
Do i have time to change?

726
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,970
If you want to save your article

727
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:21,420
You'd better getting there quick

728
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,590
Um...lexy

729
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,240
Can you get the book from
the art department? please

730
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,700
Get it yourself

731
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,240
You know how to grab things

732
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,390
Lexy,Lexy,hey...

733
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,120
Let me retell the honesty with you

734
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,370
The only reason i hired
you is because you are hot

735
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,960
In fact, you are crazy hot

736
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,420
And i am a man who like
to look at beautiful woman

737
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,940
So...sue me

738
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,560
No, he is just...

739
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,940
Kidding...no.... don't...sue him

740
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,680
Daniel, waht are you doing

741
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,230
I am telling the truth

742
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,990
You are not right for this job, Lexy

743
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,630
You are mean, you are impatient

744
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,100
You walk around as if
everyone is blow you

745
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,310
And they are

746
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,190
Because you are

747
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,330
Twenty-feet tall

748
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,410
You are not an assitant, Lexy

749
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:13,800
I think you would make a terrific model

750
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,300
- a model? 
- yeah. think about it...

751
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,270
You shouln't be behind the desk

752
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,100
You shold be sprod across a desk

753
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,000
Dressing skintight looking
hungry on a cover of a magzine

754
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,100
Oh, God

755
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,910
You know, i...always thought

756
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,810
I was too pretty to be a secretary, but

757
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,720
Girls always hated me

758
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,410
When i said that loud

759
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,330
Oh, you will see it then, say

760
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,670
I am a model

761
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,400
I am a model

762
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,510
Thank you

763
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,470
Um...i have to go to
tell everyone that i konw

764
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,040
What is the hell was that?

765
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:58,940
Honesty

766
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,820
I am sorry, Gill, you can't
convince me that lagging of

767
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,060
Your articles are out

768
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,850
Who is next

769
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,990
Whatever that is, it's cut

770
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:12,560
Wait...wait...

771
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,220
Doesn't Betty get a chance to

772
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,330
Defend her article everyone else did

773
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,510
Alright, she has 30 second, let's go

774
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,900
Ok...um...

775
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,000
My article is about the
toughest job in New York

776
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,980
Seems a little dry

777
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,280
Maybe, you could use some moisture

778
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,390
I am sorry, Betty

779
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,730
I don't think it fits in Mode

780
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,370
Maybe it has to be that

781
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,580
Wait...Wilmi

782
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,130
But you could be

783
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,430
If we recreated it for you

784
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,720
What are you doing?

785
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,970
I am saving you

786
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,550
Come on, there

787
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,450
Eat me i am a hot dog

788
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,300
And i am the whole wheat bun

789
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,770
Now it's  time to eat the
great cheese under the sun

790
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,240
Add a squirt of ketchup, a whole lot fun

791
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,080
Eat me on my hot dog

792
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,820
Eat me on my body us

793
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,170
That was the most humiliating
thing I've ever seen.

794
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,260
Yes. These uniforms are ridiculous.

795
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,430
But this city is full of uniforms

796
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,820
inspiration for fasion comes
from the most unlikely places

797
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,020
Like, bad pessengers in bright light car

798
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,320
Or the aplites on a policeman's uniform.

799
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,880
Trash collectors were wearing jumpsuits

800
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,280
Way before they showed up
on every runway last spring.

801
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,040
Also, look at the funny pictures

802
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040
of Betty wearing the uniforms.

803
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,000
I can't run those pictures.

804
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,700
Then, instead of betty,

805
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,470
Picture supermodels.

806
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,750
Em, congratulations, buddy.

807
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,240
You're in.

808
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,230
Wow, look how good these came out.

809
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,510
Oh, here is Lexy pulling a petty cab.

810
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,600
Yep, the camera loves lexy like sexy

811
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,310
I have no idea what I was thinking

812
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,810
Hiring her as my assistent.

813
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,040
That is something the
old daniel would do.

814
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,960
Come on. you made a mistake.

815
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,890
you are only human.

816
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,650
So, why is that you cut me

817
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,650
but you won't do the same for yourself?

818
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:26,650
What do you mean?

819
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,060
I mean, this is your first
piece for the magazine as editor.

820
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,310
It's a great spread.

821
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,780
You don't look even
a little bit excited.

822
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,380
I'm excited.

823
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,300
But...

824
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,490
It's just... I've been
fighting and fighting with marc

825
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,880
Trying prove to him that I
deserved to be the editor,

826
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,550
And he is the one who saved the day

827
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,010
Betty this whole piece was your idea.

828
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,440
Why don't you know that
you are good at this

829
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,650
you are great at this?

830
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,370
I don't know. maybe because I was tails.

831
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,840
Look, Betty,

832
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,610
Some people get the job because

833
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,040
Of the flip of a coin, right?

834
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,150
Some people get the job because

835
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,850
Their father owns the company.

836
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,950
It doesn't matter how you get it.

837
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,130
Matters what you do with it.

838
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,330
Hilda, can I borrow you?

839
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,570
It will only take a minute.

840
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,880
I will be right back.

841
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,890
And now the candader Archie Rodriguez

842
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:32,510
About a certain photo of my girlfriend.

843
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,730
And I just want the press
stop showing this photo.

844
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,810
Ai, this is not my best angle.

845
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,680
Everyone is asking me if I
want to apologize to the voters.

846
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,480
The truth is the only person
who deserves an apology

847
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,660
Is my girlfriend.

848
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,690
She had her privacy invaded

849
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,670
And I'm sorry I wasn't
more understanding.

850
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,940
As for the voters, they have
only to accept the fact that

851
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,090
My girlfriend is sexy

852
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,590
And I will not apologize for that.

853
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,320
Archie.

854
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,210
I can't believe you did that.

855
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,880
Yeah, and we got the latest polls

856
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,940
And thanks to your sexy picture,

857
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,110
Hilda, I'm more popular than ever

858
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,100
I'm in the lead.

859
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,130
Oh, my god!

860
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,770
Oh, my god! This is fantasitic.

861
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,350
Oh, my god! Archie, you're gonna win.

862
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,160
Wait, now?

863
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,770
I have customers.

864
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,460
They can wait

865
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,500
I'll be back in 11 minutes.

866
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,400
I brought us a treat.

867
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,590
Frozen yoghurt.

868
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,870
Chocolate, my favourate.

869
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,840
Em, mine too.

870
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,440
Frozen yogurt in the middle of the day,

871
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
what's the occasion.

872
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,570
Mama is keeping her job.

873
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,970
Esablle turned it down.

874
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,960
And for the last mean I don't know why

875
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,450
she'd think that Mode is
a stepup from Frech ELLE

876
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,870
I heard she got a call

877
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,490
from an editor of french mode

878
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,100
Something about how difficult
Clair were to work for

879
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,320
I don't remember bribing
anyone from mode france.

880
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,230
Bonjour

881
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,350
********

882
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:26,810
You?

883
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,170
You devest little minx

884
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,370
I guess all those years of
french boarding school paid off.

885
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,840
Mum, I'm just so sorry

886
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,750
About dragging you into all this

887
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,340
And I figured after
everything you've done for me,

888
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,010
I owed you.

889
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,950
Oh, Nicole,

890
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,380
My darling daughter,

891
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,410
I would do anything for you

892
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,060
And I have a feeling

893
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,670
Everything is gonna be all right.

894
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,600
Oh, I thought you swore
you'd never get me a coffee.

895
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,670
Don't get too excited.
i put it on your card.

896
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:19,070
Oh, I want to show you the
final edit of the article.

897
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,070
You know, betty, you're
a great writer now,

898
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,820
I am not exact in the
reading mood right now,

899
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,020
Could you just give me the summary.

900
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,210
Could you read the top?

901
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,210
*************

902
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,730
You're sharing your byline with me?

903
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,680
In five years of mode,
I've never had a byline.

904
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,050
Why are you so nice to me?

905
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,260
Either one of us could
have gotten this promotion

906
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,100
and right before daniel told me

907
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,860
He had this look on his face

908
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,840
And I thought, that's it,
you're leaving tomorow.

909
00:40:58,810 --> 00:40:59,980
I were sure of it.

910
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,050
I mean I'd say I would
been happy for you, but

911
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,190
I don't know.

912
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,240
You would've been happy.

913
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,440
Were you just about to hug me?

914
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,260
Shut up. no.

915
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,040
You were about to hug me!

916
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,020
Okay. ha-ha.

917
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,620
Can we talk about this byline?

918
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,880
Shouldn't my name come first?

919
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,120
Don't push it.
