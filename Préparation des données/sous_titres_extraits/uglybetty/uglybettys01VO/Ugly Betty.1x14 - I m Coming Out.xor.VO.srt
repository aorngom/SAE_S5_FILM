1
00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:01,897
Previously on "Ugly Betty"...

2
00:00:01,907 --> 00:00:03,463
Betty's busy.
Can I take a message?

3
00:00:03,473 --> 00:00:05,690
Yes, please.
Tell her she can call me.

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,728
I'll tell her.

5
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:08,263
I wanted to give you this.

6
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,633
Ooh, you just don't know
what this means to me.

7
00:00:11,643 --> 00:00:14,106
If a woman didn't want to be
a seamstress her whole life,

8
00:00:14,116 --> 00:00:15,645
what exactly would
she have to do?

9
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:19,570
Drop this off at the nearest
police station anonymously.

10
00:00:19,588 --> 00:00:22,000
I guess I don't really
think of Alex as being gone.

11
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:24,389
- How did he...
- He jumped out of a helicopter

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,930
to ski down mount Juno.

13
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:29,638
Looks like that skiing
accident really paid off...

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,443
Alex Meade.

15
00:00:31,878 --> 00:00:33,823
Alexis, darling.

16
00:00:35,086 --> 00:00:37,062
It's Alexis now.

17
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:55,642
Good morning, Betty.

18
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:56,842
Hi, dad.

19
00:00:56,878 --> 00:00:58,453
Betty Suarez!

20
00:01:00,216 --> 00:01:02,282
I know. I named you.

21
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:04,431
No, it's fashion week.

22
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:06,670
Daniel's in charge of the "Mode" show.
It's crazy.

23
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:09,823
No, he asked for
black tablecloths.

24
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:11,720
Napkins. Oh, uh...

25
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:13,510
Silver. Black will
make them pop.

26
00:01:13,526 --> 00:01:15,361
Silver napkins. Thank you.

27
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:16,973
What is fashion week?

28
00:01:16,988 --> 00:01:18,933
"What's fashion week"?

29
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:21,223
Only the most important
event in the industry.

30
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:23,732
When the buyers get their
first look at the fall lines?

31
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:26,583
Am I going to have to
explain couture again?

32
00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:27,511
Please don't.

33
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:28,940
Betty Suarez!

34
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,782
Eat your pancake on the train.

35
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:32,091
I'll pack your breakfast to go.

36
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:34,503
No, leave the seating chart to me.
I'm on my way.

37
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,890
Oh, sure.

38
00:01:36,906 --> 00:01:38,761
She gets a job right away.

39
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:41,772
You know, yesterday she was a nun.
Today she's wearing pasties.

40
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:44,022
Come on, Hilda. Come on. You're
gonna find a job soon. You'll see.

41
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:46,680
Oh, hey. What about "Mode"?

42
00:01:47,346 --> 00:01:49,630
They hiring any help
for this, um...

43
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:50,973
fashion thing?

44
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:52,692
Fashion week!

45
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,602
What is wrong with this family?

46
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:57,253
Hilda, I really want to help out,
but we're just...

47
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:58,820
we're filled up.

48
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:01,102
Here.

49
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:02,582
Thank you.

50
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:04,983
Isn't there anything
for your sister?

51
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:07,153
Dad, we cannot work together.
Don't you remember

52
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,672
the Lemon Ice King disaster?
She doesn't listen to me.

53
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:13,241
That was a long time ago,
and it wasn't her fault.

54
00:02:13,255 --> 00:02:14,912
She refused to wear a hairnet.

55
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,341
That man choked
on her bobby pin,

56
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:18,552
and I was the one
who got fired.

57
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:21,320
Look, I love her,
but it's not a good fit.

58
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:22,873
Betty Suarez!

59
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:26,100
Thank you for calling back.
It's Victoria Beckham.

60
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:27,601
You're talking to Posh?

61
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:29,803
No, but I'm talking to the
people who talk to her.

62
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:32,073
Betty rules.

63
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:38,883
Daniel, I want to talk to you.

64
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:41,222
Great. Another scotch lecture.

65
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:43,410
I've been thinking
about your brother.

66
00:02:43,427 --> 00:02:46,761
Right, so this is where you tell me
what a disappointment I've been, right?

67
00:02:46,777 --> 00:02:49,352
How I'll never
fill Alex's shoes?

68
00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:51,953
Alex died two years ago.

69
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:53,390
This is about you.

70
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:56,161
You've really proven yourself
these past few months, Daniel.

71
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:59,202
One  day, Meade Publications
is gonna be in your hands.

72
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:00,650
Right, dad.

73
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,340
Whatever you say.

74
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:04,101
I mean it.

75
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:09,861
Tomorrow after the show, I plan on
announcing my intentions to the press.

76
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:14,082
Thank you.

77
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:16,473
I'm proud of you, son.

78
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:25,513
Hi, sailor.

79
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:29,933
You're booking a cruise?

80
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:32,700
You can't afford to cruise the
bathroom on the 17th floor.

81
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:34,663
I have some money coming in.

82
00:03:34,678 --> 00:03:36,041
From where?

83
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:37,832
None of your business. Go away.

84
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:39,740
Isn't there someone with a cold
sore you could be making fun of?

85
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:41,793
Oh, come on. Spill.

86
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:44,231
It's me. We share lip gloss.

87
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:47,523
You know how every year,
there's the "it" item

88
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:48,923
that comes out of fashion week?

89
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,563
- Hello, wide belt--2006.
- Nah.

90
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:56,030
And you know how every year
Eternal 18 has an exact knockoff of "it,"

91
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:58,732
mere days later?

92
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:03,932
Who do you think tips them
off for a big old bag of cash?

93
00:04:03,948 --> 00:04:05,030
What?!

94
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:09,213
You've been selling your integrity
to some tacky mall store?

95
00:04:09,277 --> 00:04:11,023
Genius. Count me in.

96
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:12,161
Forget it, Clyde.

97
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:14,340
Find your own
criminal activity.

98
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:18,512
Crazy in roadkill, 2:00.

99
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,190
Ah! Buongiorno, peon!

100
00:04:21,205 --> 00:04:24,181
Oh, no, no, no.
Fabia, you cannot just go in.

101
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:28,443
I love your assistant.

102
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:30,351
I have the same one in beige.

103
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:33,093
Fabia, I didn't know you
were in the building.

104
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,123
I can usually smell
you from the lobby.

105
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:39,301
Well, you know, seeing that Fabia
donated $20,000 in cosmetics

106
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:41,741
for the fashion
show gift bag...

107
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:44,852
I figured you take
Fabia to lunch, no?

108
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,850
Oh, darling, I-I would love to,
but I can't. I'm swamped.

109
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,213
Not to mention,
I'm getting a promotion.

110
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:53,853
It's still a little hush-hush,
but you are looking

111
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:57,402
at the-soon-to-be-crowned
editor in chief of "Mode."

112
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,883
That dress...

113
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:07,963
It is Eduardo!

114
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:10,891
Yes. I'm wearing it to
the fashion show tomorrow.

115
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:14,900
I went to Eduardo's studio,
and he promised this dress to me.

116
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,050
I even make for my picchu...

117
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,130
a matching ensemble.

118
00:05:19,146 --> 00:05:22,213
Well, call Eduardo and
see if he has another one.

119
00:05:22,227 --> 00:05:23,423
Don't be stupido.

120
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:25,893
What are we,
the freaking Olsen twins?

121
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,340
Fine.

122
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:29,140
Have it your way.

123
00:05:29,157 --> 00:05:31,453
Perhaps it'll look better
in a plus size anyway.

124
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:32,803
Come on, baby. We go.

125
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:36,600
Ah, Fabia, silly,
little, delusional Fabia,

126
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:40,730
I'm sure you and your little bitch
will look fabulous in anything.

127
00:05:40,856 --> 00:05:44,643
Look at that face.
It is flawless.

128
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,343
My god, it is flawless.
Who did your eyes? Shapiro?

129
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:50,503
Fabia has had no work done! 

130
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:51,740
Please.

131
00:05:51,756 --> 00:05:53,950
There's enough leftover
skin from your surgeries

132
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:55,620
to make a bed for my cat.

133
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:57,542
For your information,

134
00:05:57,555 --> 00:05:59,491
this not surgery.

135
00:05:59,507 --> 00:06:01,751
This duck sauce.

136
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,192
Excuse me?

137
00:06:03,205 --> 00:06:05,750
The sauce from a man duck

138
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:07,853
that make the baby duck.

139
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:12,530
I  had a doctor-- a Dr.
Wong on Spring Street.

140
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:14,620
He give me the
injection into my face.

141
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:17,082
And poof! Ten years gone.

142
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:19,483
And you could look 65 again.

143
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:21,190
Well, as lovely as that sounds,

144
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:25,389
I'm a few years away from having
a duck quack off in my face.

145
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,670
Whatever you say...

146
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,088
Wrinklemina.

147
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:35,740
Ciao.

148
00:06:35,957 --> 00:06:38,573
See you later,
we go to mangia now.

149
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,130
Come on baby.

150
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:42,591
Marc!

151
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:45,880
Dr. Wong, Spring Street--
I'm on it.

152
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:52,731
Um, I think I ordered
a smaller size.

153
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:54,073
For who?

154
00:06:54,086 --> 00:06:55,600
You could wash it...

155
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:58,462
like, a few thousand times.

156
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,063
Henry, hi.

157
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:03,852
Uh, how have you been?

158
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:06,073
Oh, good. Busy.

159
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:08,560
So I hear you're working
hard on the "Mode" show.

160
00:07:08,577 --> 00:07:10,842
They must have liked how you
pulled off the Christmas party.

161
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,280
Uh, hey, listen.

162
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:14,193
I kinda wanted to talk
to you about that.

163
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:15,460
Betty!

164
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,810
Oh, my God.

165
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:19,503
Hi!

166
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:21,571
Hilda, what are you doing here?

167
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:22,832
I am recovering.

168
00:07:22,846 --> 00:07:25,550
Oprah told me that I need
to take control of my life,

169
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:29,053
and then Dr. Phil told me that
I need to take on a challenge,

170
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:32,730
and then Rachael Ray made a pie.
Anyway, the point is I am back!

171
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:35,103
And I need ten
copies of my résumé.

172
00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:39,040
Oh, hello.

173
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:40,303
I'm Hilda.

174
00:07:40,318 --> 00:07:42,013
I'm Betty's sister.

175
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:44,323
Henry. I think we
spoke on the phone.

176
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:46,330
- When?
- Oh, so nice to meet you.

177
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:49,282
- What? When did you talk--
- Where's the xerox machine? Walk me.

178
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:52,191
Hilda, this is my job. You can't just
walk in whenever you feel like it.

179
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,652
Is that your boss?

180
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:56,013
- Hey, Daniel.
- The xerox machine is over there.

181
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:57,343
Daniel!

182
00:07:58,106 --> 00:07:59,963
How was your meeting
with your father?

183
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:01,790
Uh... better than I thought.

184
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:03,742
He didn't give you
the old Alex speech?

185
00:08:03,758 --> 00:08:07,400
No, he's finally seeing me as an
adult who can take responsibility--

186
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:08,920
Brodeo!

187
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:12,362
- Security!
- No, no, no. Betty, Betty.

188
00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:15,153
This is my friend I was
telling you about-- Becks.

189
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,950
Oh! I'm so sorry.

190
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:19,631
The photojournalist. I'm Betty.

191
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:21,973
We spoke on the phone 
when you were in Africa.

192
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:23,920
I heard all that growling
in the background.

193
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,920
Yeah, she and I broke up.

194
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,751
Listen, Betty,

195
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:31,283
if Daniel ever gives
you a hard time,

196
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:32,793
you let me know.

197
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:35,661
I'll take him out back,
teach him some manners.

198
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:37,673
Okay.

199
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:41,913
Betty Suarez.

200
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:43,532
O kay.

201
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:45,182
Joke's over.

202
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:47,901
Where's your real assistant?

203
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,552
Oh, come on.
Betty's a great girl.

204
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,431
Maybe after a half dozen shots.

205
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,771
All right, all right.

206
00:08:52,788 --> 00:08:55,683
Look at what I brought
you from Africa.

207
00:08:55,698 --> 00:08:57,111
What is that?

208
00:08:57,126 --> 00:08:59,361
An oshe shango.

209
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:01,051
So seriously, how was Africa?

210
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,741
Oh, it was
totally mind-blowing--

211
00:09:04,257 --> 00:09:08,173
bullets flying, rebel attacks,
human suffering...

212
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:09,782
Not a hottie to be found.

213
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:12,701
I mean, they're thin and all,
but it's that sick thin, not hot thin.

214
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:15,262
Cultural sensitive as always.

215
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:16,830
So what brings you back, huh?

216
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:18,221
It's fashion week.

217
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:20,330
- The booty-lympics.
- Yeah, I know.

218
00:09:20,346 --> 00:09:21,791
I can't do that this year.

219
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:23,822
I'm the editor in chief now.

220
00:09:23,837 --> 00:09:27,650
Do you have to talk like that when
you say... "editor in chief"?

221
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,390
I do.

222
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:30,131
Come on.
This is our thing. Besides,

223
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:34,093
I didn't travel halfway around the
world for you to turn into your father.

224
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,440
Good thing is my father is
treating me differently now.

225
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,623
You know, he's about to give
me the keys to the kingdom.

226
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:41,191
Yeah? Well, you didn't get
all tight-ass when he gave you

227
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,133
the keys to his Bentley.
We totaled that.

228
00:09:44,305 --> 00:09:46,550
- Yeah.
- I get it.

229
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:50,863
You're just afraid that I'm
gonna bag the hottest girl again.

230
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:55,061
Becks, this week isn't
about that anymore.

231
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:58,911
I have to keep my eyes on the clothes,
not the models wearing them.

232
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:00,291
Wow.

233
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:02,601
Do you pee sitting
down now, too?

234
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:09,301
Okay, thank you very much.

235
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:11,701
I thought you said ten copies.

236
00:10:11,718 --> 00:10:15,213
Well, I must've hit the "zero"
button by accident... twice.

237
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:18,022
- Ooh, pencils!
- No, no.

238
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:20,840
Betty, can you get us a couple take-out
menus for the japanese place downstairs?

239
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:22,400
Hey, Hilda. How are you?

240
00:10:22,418 --> 00:10:25,470
Oh, just making a couple
copies of my résumé.

241
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:26,912
I need a job.

242
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,473
Really? Well,
we could always use

243
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:31,273
some more help for fashion week.
Betty, just hook her up.

244
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:34,991
Oh, my God!

245
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:37,873
Oh, my God. We're gonna be
working together. "Hook me up."

246
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:40,263
Well, it wouldn't be
so much "together."

247
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:42,143
I'd be your boss.

248
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:44,382
Yeah, right.

249
00:10:44,396 --> 00:10:47,043
You know what? Hilda,
I don't think that this is a good idea.

250
00:10:47,057 --> 00:10:49,580
What? Are you kidding?
It's gonna be great!

251
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:52,523
Lemon Ice sisters reunited!

252
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,980
I  can't wait.
Do you know what I'm going to wear?

253
00:10:54,998 --> 00:10:56,703
This will be so much fun!

256
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:14,790
No, no, don't raise your arms,
you twit.

257
00:11:14,805 --> 00:11:16,643
It's not pinned yet.

258
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:20,392
So I'm kinda having
a rough day.

259
00:11:20,406 --> 00:11:21,461
It's not draping.

260
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:23,981
My first show,
and it's not draping... right.

261
00:11:23,995 --> 00:11:25,582
It started out pretty decent.

262
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:29,103
Betty, can you cut to the chase, please?
You have 30 seconds. Go.

263
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:31,471
Daniel hired Hilda to help
us with fashion week.

264
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:34,073
She's not gonna listen to me, and she's
going to take over like she always does.

265
00:11:34,106 --> 00:11:36,002
20 seconds. Stop overreacting.

266
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:38,053
Well, you've obviously
never had an older sister.

267
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,251
15 seconds.

268
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,142
1991--I win the science fair.

269
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:42,691
Hilda wins miss
Junior Teen Queens.

270
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:43,921
Who do you think got a cake?

271
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,282
1994--I come home
with straight A's.

272
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:48,420
Hilda comes home pregnant.

273
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:49,471
She gets another cake.

274
00:11:49,486 --> 00:11:51,213
What, so this is about cake?

275
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:53,352
It's about how she always
steals my thunder.

276
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:55,532
Here at "Mode," I'm Betty.

277
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,670
Everywhere else,
I'm Hilda's sister.

278
00:11:57,687 --> 00:12:00,302
Betty, you were at "Mode" first.
Here she's gonna be...

279
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:01,770
Betty's sister.

280
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,603
Hmm. That isn't so bad.

281
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:07,121
Bollocks. These
designs are awful.

282
00:12:07,136 --> 00:12:08,882
No, they're not.

283
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:12,263
Thank you. They're going to steal
the show, so stop stressing.

284
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:15,990
Betty, everything I have ever
wanted since I was 15 years old

285
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:18,193
hinges on a 6-minute
runway show!

286
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:21,142
Christina, you are amazing.

287
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:24,211
You have to say that.
You're my friend.

288
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:25,513
But Wilhelmina isn't,

289
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:28,872
and she would have never picked
you if you didn't have talent.

290
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:33,260
Yep. Well,
Wilhelmina picked me because...

291
00:12:34,618 --> 00:12:37,243
Well, we'll find out soon enough,
won't we?

292
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:42,190
You need to fill out this
form and send it back.

293
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:44,131
Wait. I-I-I filled
this out last week.

294
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:45,753
- You did?
- Uh-huh.

295
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:48,661
Oh. I guess you did.

296
00:12:48,677 --> 00:12:50,213
Well, you need to
fill out this one.

297
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:51,691
And this one, too?

298
00:12:52,268 --> 00:12:53,453
You didn't turn 'em in?

299
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:56,150
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little distracted.

300
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:57,682
My, um...

301
00:12:58,188 --> 00:12:59,580
It's not important.

302
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:04,153
Are you sure that these will be
ready in time for my... court date?

303
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,682
Of course. I'm a professional.

304
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:14,110
You wanna...
talk about anything?

305
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:16,873
No. I'm fine.

306
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:19,332
He dumped me.

307
00:13:19,996 --> 00:13:22,461
- Who?
- My boyfriend Toussaint.

308
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:23,692
He's a dog.

309
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,871
I mean, who dumps somebody
this close to Valentine's day?

310
00:13:27,378 --> 00:13:30,750
And I already bought
him some chocolates.

311
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:37,940
Here, here.

312
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:45,122
Constance, you're
a terrific woman.

313
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:48,792
You'll find someone else to
give your chocolates to.

314
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:51,570
Oh, Ignacio.

315
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:53,713
You're so sweet.

316
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:57,400
Why can't all men be like you?

317
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:01,273
Ignacio!

318
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:04,001
Can you believe
it's finally here?

319
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:06,290
Everything we've worked for.

320
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:10,941
By this time tomorrow, Daniel and
Bradford will be as out as ugg boots.

321
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,833
And I can't wait.

322
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:15,951
In fact, I think I'm gonna get
there a little early tomorrow.

323
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:17,121
What?!

324
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:18,521
That's not what we planned.

325
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:19,781
I want to mingle.

326
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:22,671
Besides, I never got to
go to my own funeral.

327
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:26,841
I want to know what the world
really thought of Alex Meade,

328
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:28,403
especially my brother.

329
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:29,511
It's risky.

330
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:30,970
It's worth it.

331
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:32,872
Where are you anyway?

332
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:34,861
Uh, teeth cleaning.

333
00:14:34,877 --> 00:14:38,221
I will see you tomorrow.

334
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:44,031
Bring on the duck, Dr. Wong.

335
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:50,983
Hilda, come on!
We're gonna be late!

336
00:14:56,907 --> 00:14:58,192
Hilda!

337
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:02,263
What did you do?

338
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:03,623
You like?

339
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:04,791
It was kinda boring.

340
00:15:04,807 --> 00:15:06,262
It was kind of our uniform. 

341
00:15:06,276 --> 00:15:08,392
What? It still says "Mode."

342
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:11,660
Or "Ode." Whatever.

343
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:14,910
You're supposed to work the
fashion show, not be in it.

344
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:17,540
Your only job today is
hanging and steaming clothes.

345
00:15:17,558 --> 00:15:19,872
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They're gonna pay me in cash, right?

346
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:22,220
Have you seen my keys?

347
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:24,783
Wait.

348
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,472
Looking  for these?

349
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:29,453
Okay, here's how this
is gonna work, ladies.

350
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,641
You two are taking
me to fashion week.

351
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:33,331
- Justin, if--
- No argument.

352
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:35,032
I've been waiting for
this my whole life.

353
00:15:35,105 --> 00:15:37,493
I did my homework.
I called in sick to school today.

354
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:39,082
You just have to sign
this little slip.

355
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:42,211
- If you think for a second that--
- I swear, mom, I will run away.

356
00:15:42,228 --> 00:15:44,480
I know a kid in sixth
grade that sells crack.

357
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:52,212
Okay, all right.
Why don't we just bring dad, too?

358
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:12,302
We are reporting live
from Bryant Park--

359
00:16:12,315 --> 00:16:14,250
the kickoff of fashion week.

360
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:17,003
In the red tent,
the Calvin Klein collection,

361
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:21,193
and in the white tent,
"Mode's" Ten Designers to Watch.

362
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:23,872
Karl Lagerfeld, we love you.

363
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:28,102
Ponytail at 70? Brave.

364
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:31,922
I did catch a glimpse
of Zac Posen's line,

365
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:34,143
and I think the construction
was impeccable.

366
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:35,103
Hey.

367
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:37,121
Did you see that redhead
with the pair of--

368
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:39,820
Would you excuse us?
I thought we talked about this.

369
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:41,921
I'll gonna see you after fashion week,
all right?

370
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:43,693
Fine. Less competition,

371
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:45,573
more meow for me.

372
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:47,140
Good. Go. Enjoy yourself.

373
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:49,622
Just make sure to ask the russian
models for I.D. this time.

374
00:16:49,637 --> 00:16:52,153
Oh, come on. Give me an hour.

375
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,793
You know you want to.

376
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:55,431
Our usual bet?

377
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:59,100
Whoever scores with the
hottest girl here wins...

378
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:01,011
$1.

379
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:04,211
Becks, I'm not that guy anymore.
I told you.

380
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:33,951
You're on.

381
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:50,752
Oh, my God.

382
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:53,321
I think I'm gonna pass out.

383
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:56,020
Heidi Klum and Seal
and baby Seal.

384
00:17:56,037 --> 00:17:58,142
- Okay, but no autographs.
- Okay.

385
00:17:58,158 --> 00:18:00,011
Oh, my God! J-Lo!

386
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:02,863
Hilda! Hilda! You're supposed
to be in the wardrobe tent.

387
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:04,673
- Now give me the camera.
- Hey, give it back!

388
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,973
- I'm your supervisor.
- I will sit on you.

389
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:09,212
We're not at home.
Try and act like an adult.

390
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:11,631
Now go find something to steam.
Go on.

391
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:14,523
- And you--
- I know. I know.

392
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:16,802
20 feet from Naomi
Campbell at all times.

393
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:17,981
For your own good.

394
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:23,021
Look at me! I am a monster!

395
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:24,742
How bad is it?

396
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:26,231
Honest.

397
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:29,501
Not that bad at all.

398
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:33,040
A little cover-up and some
hemorrhoid cream for the swelling...

399
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:34,533
you're good to go.

400
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:38,442
It's getting worse by the minute.
I can't see a thing.

401
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:41,321
It's a blessing, Willie.
Think about it.

402
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:44,342
Fashion week--all those
people you don't want to see.

403
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:46,481
But they have to see me,

404
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:49,051
and you will be by my
side at all times.

405
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:53,181
You will be my seeing eye gay.

406
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:56,412
Now show me where
the bathroom is.

407
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,550
No, no, no.

408
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:10,321
- What?
- Crisis.

409
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:12,381
You're in on the
Eternal 18 deal.

410
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:14,192
You need to help me
find the "it" item.

411
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,891
Really? 50-50?

412
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,160
- 40-60.
- 45-55.

413
00:19:18,178 --> 00:19:19,672
Don't push it, bitch.

414
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:26,443
She just seems so distant lately,
you know?

415
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,502
She's always busy
with work stuff.

416
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:32,323
It's fashion week-- when the buyers get
their first looks at the fall couture.

417
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:34,903
I think there's
a Knicks game on.

418
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,470
Constance. Do we have
an appointment today?

419
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,242
Oh, this isn't business.

420
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:49,013
You were just so sweet the other night,
getting my mind off Toussaint.

421
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,870
By the way,

422
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,693
here's his chocolates.

423
00:19:57,085 --> 00:19:59,950
- There's three left.
- I don't like nuts.

424
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:05,350
But I thought I'd make you a
little gumbo as a thank you,

425
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:08,063
and for dessert--
"failure to launch."

426
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:10,862
But I-I-I've already eaten.

427
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,612
Oh, you think you have,

428
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,273
but you haven't
tasted my gumbo.

429
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:15,871
How you doing, cutie?

430
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:33,551
Would you excuse
me just a seconde?

431
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:36,372
How you doin'?

432
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:37,630
Pretty good.

433
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:39,710
You got a quarter I can borrow?

434
00:20:39,728 --> 00:20:40,592
Why?

435
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,673
I told my mother I'd call
her when I fell in love.

436
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:45,922
You've got to me kidding me.

437
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:49,371
That line is as old
as pay phones, buddy.

438
00:20:49,386 --> 00:20:51,742
I think you dropped your
game right over there.

439
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:56,791
Hi. I'm Daniel Meade.

440
00:20:57,515 --> 00:20:59,603
Have we met before?

441
00:21:04,247 --> 00:21:06,902
You don't want her cooking your lunch,
just tell her.

442
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:08,951
She's my
immigration caseworker.

443
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,662
I piss that woman off, I end up
on the other side of that fence.

444
00:21:11,675 --> 00:21:13,132
Nacho!

445
00:21:13,578 --> 00:21:15,213
Nacho?

446
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:16,870
It's her little pet name.

447
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:18,520
I think she wants to eat me.

448
00:21:18,537 --> 00:21:20,821
Um, where do you keep
your pepper, sugar?

449
00:21:20,836 --> 00:21:22,690
'Cause we need something spicy.

450
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:24,643
Oh, wait. Here I am.

451
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,380
Maybe you need to remind her that
she works for the government.

452
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:33,522
She could lose her job.

453
00:21:33,535 --> 00:21:35,762
And where should I make that
phone call from, Walter?

454
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:37,251
Guadalajara?

455
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:41,131
Her boyfriend dumped her,
and now she wants me.

456
00:21:42,077 --> 00:21:44,621
Well, there's only
one thing you can do.

457
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:48,602
You gotta get her back
with the boyfriend.

458
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:53,312
Oh, my god.

459
00:22:01,427 --> 00:22:03,262
Fabia. 2:00.

460
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:05,903
You're on Tokyo time, woman.
This way.

461
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,303
Ciao, bella!

462
00:22:11,306 --> 00:22:15,151
Oh, you're right.
You look so much better in that dress,

463
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,712
especially with
those sunglasses.

464
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:25,813
Did someone pay little
visit to my Dr. Wong?

465
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,283
I'll get you, Fabia...

466
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:31,280
and your little dog, too.

467
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,621
Marc! Marc!

468
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:35,050
Hi, hi. This way.

469
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:38,621
Trust me. The kleenex arts getting
clumpy if you start to sweat,

470
00:22:38,635 --> 00:22:41,780
but if I find me cutlets to
stuff in there, I'll get you.

471
00:22:41,797 --> 00:22:43,542
- Thanks, Hilda.
- Sure.

472
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:45,302
- Excuse us. Hilda?
- Yeah?

473
00:22:45,315 --> 00:22:47,591
The models don't like it
when you talk to them.

474
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:49,571
But the girl doesn't
have any boobs.

475
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:51,921
I'm giving her some tips so she
doesn't look like a 12-year-old boy.

476
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:53,322
I'm just warning you.

477
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:54,980
She crack me up.

478
00:22:54,996 --> 00:22:58,303
Hey, Hilda. We're having a
party at G Spa after the show.

479
00:22:58,318 --> 00:22:59,612
I'll put you on the list.

480
00:22:59,626 --> 00:23:01,322
Oh, cool!

481
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,871
Can I bring my sister?

482
00:23:02,885 --> 00:23:04,372
Um...

483
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:06,723
yeah, sure.

484
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:12,180
You're welcome.

485
00:23:12,195 --> 00:23:13,712
I have a spring roll.

486
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:17,191
Come to me. Come to me. Oh, oh, oh,
to the left, to the left. To the right.

487
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:18,900
This is ridiculous.

488
00:23:18,915 --> 00:23:21,790
It's been a couple of hours.
The swelling must have gone down by now.

489
00:23:21,807 --> 00:23:23,960
I'm taking off
these damn glasses.

490
00:23:24,698 --> 00:23:26,433
Oh, no.

491
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:28,353
Find me a veil.

492
00:23:31,525 --> 00:23:33,911
Uh, Uma. It's Uma.

493
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:35,390
Yo.

494
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:38,513
I am at the Betsey Johnson
show in the purple tent,

495
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:39,741
and I've found it!

496
00:23:39,758 --> 00:23:43,040
The faux rabbit fur micro-mini--
the "it" item for 2007.

497
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:44,091
Are you sure?

498
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:46,791
Yes. Everyone is going crazy.

499
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:48,533
Mischa Barton just knocked
over Bate Bosworth.

500
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:49,943
Oh, like that's so hard.

501
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,852
Okay. Just get over here.
We have to steal it.

502
00:23:52,868 --> 00:23:55,141
Wilhelmina's talking to a mannequin.
I'll be right there.

503
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:02,950
What are you doing?

504
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:04,913
First you tell me I
can't steam clothes,

505
00:24:04,928 --> 00:24:06,523
and then you criticize
the way I hang a dress,

506
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:08,311
and now I can't
put out gift bags?

507
00:24:08,328 --> 00:24:11,251
Well, they just weren't
all facing the same angle.

508
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:13,650
Honey, you are a freak.

509
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,453
Will you please just go
get the rest of the bags?

510
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,210
Okay, Betty, but I don't know.

511
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:19,152
I hope I don't get lost.

512
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:22,833
Betty, you've gotta get over to the
Sean John show in the green tent.

513
00:24:22,846 --> 00:24:26,831
Look what I learned--
popping and locking.

514
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:31,091
Thank you. That's the first
time I've laughed all day.

515
00:24:31,107 --> 00:24:33,572
Oh, I have something for you.

516
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:37,410
Thought this might be a little more
flattering than the one you got stuck with...

517
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:40,211
not that you don't
always look good.

518
00:24:40,866 --> 00:24:42,182
Thanks.

519
00:24:42,656 --> 00:24:43,953
Oh, look at this--

520
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:46,000
iPods, cell phones.

521
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:48,423
Hope they're declaring
those on their taxes.

522
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:51,031
- Too nerdy?
- Yeah.

523
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:53,760
Popping and locking.

524
00:24:55,187 --> 00:24:58,013
So can I ask you something?

525
00:24:58,025 --> 00:25:01,231
Why didn't you call me back
after the Christmas party?

526
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:05,302
I left a message to see if you
wanted to watch "Rudolph" together.

527
00:25:05,315 --> 00:25:07,862
What? Wait--
you left me a message? Where?

528
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:09,313
At your house.

529
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:13,661
- Hilda never told you?
- No. She didn't.

530
00:25:13,677 --> 00:25:15,043
Excuse me.

531
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:16,083
Where are you going?

532
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,090
To become an only child.

533
00:25:24,266 --> 00:25:26,940
Hey, Wilhelmina, love the hat.

534
00:25:26,957 --> 00:25:28,733
Oh, thank you.

535
00:25:28,938 --> 00:25:31,083
Do we know this person?

536
00:25:31,608 --> 00:25:34,421
Kayla Brooks, fashion
correspondent for "New York One."

537
00:25:34,435 --> 00:25:38,121
She's in a midnight blue Chanel with
pewter buttons and navy stockings.

538
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:40,783
- Mistake?
- Colossal. She looks like a mailbox.

539
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:42,212
You're good, Jason.

540
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:44,982
It's Justin, but you can call me
whatever you want. I love you.

541
00:25:50,937 --> 00:25:53,080
What am I supposed to do,
club her and strip her?

542
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:56,081
Oh, take her into a porta-potty
and seduce her out of it.

543
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:57,311
Have we met?

544
00:25:57,326 --> 00:25:59,191
Okay, I'll club her.

545
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:02,872
Oh, for God's sake, Dorothy, do you
wanna go to man-tasy island or not?

546
00:26:02,888 --> 00:26:04,100
Be a man!

547
00:26:05,926 --> 00:26:09,401
Well, it was my first
time drinking Mezcal.

548
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:11,630
I didn't know it was a worm.

549
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:14,480
Hilda, did you take
a message from...

550
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:16,963
What are you doing?

551
00:26:17,007 --> 00:26:19,433
Hilda, how do I do
that hair flip?

552
00:26:19,446 --> 00:26:20,880
In a second, Kay.

553
00:26:20,897 --> 00:26:22,340
I'm helping out.

554
00:26:22,358 --> 00:26:23,691
Christina asked me to.

555
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,030
But this is not your job.

556
00:26:25,046 --> 00:26:26,921
Hilda, I need your help.

557
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:29,022
Eat a carrot stick.
I'm talking here.

558
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:32,261
They were shorthanded,
and they needed somebody

559
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:35,981
with a background in big hair,
so come on,

560
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:37,410
who knows better than me?

561
00:26:37,427 --> 00:26:40,462
Ay, Betty,
I'm really liking it here.

562
00:26:40,477 --> 00:26:42,841
Maybe I could turn this
into a full-time thing.

563
00:26:42,856 --> 00:26:45,341
No. You shouldn't even be here.

564
00:26:45,358 --> 00:26:46,631
Give me this. I'll do it.

565
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,353
Yeah, you.
You can't even do your own hair.

566
00:26:49,365 --> 00:26:52,142
This is not our bathroom.
Don't talk to me like that.

567
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:54,701
You are giving
her a wind tunnel.

568
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,782
Sorry.

569
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:05,683
Okay.

570
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:08,340
All right. Enough.

571
00:27:08,785 --> 00:27:11,132
"The Hilda show" is over!

572
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:12,690
Go home.

573
00:27:12,777 --> 00:27:15,073
- What?!
- You're fired.

574
00:27:21,717 --> 00:27:23,181
Am I done?

575
00:27:25,258 --> 00:27:28,673
So what brings you to fashion week?
Are you in the industry?

576
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,922
Not yet,
but I'm hoping to make a big splash.

577
00:27:31,938 --> 00:27:34,413
Hi. Sorry to interrupt. Here's the
coffee that I promised you an hour ago.

578
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:37,143
I'm sorry.
There are so many fires to be put out.

579
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,102
- You okay?
- Yeah.

580
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,593
You have a lot to worry about.
I'm fine.

581
00:27:41,605 --> 00:27:44,961
Will you excuse me a minute?
Hey, Betty, what's going on?

582
00:27:44,976 --> 00:27:47,870
Nothing. It's over now.
Don't worry.

583
00:27:47,885 --> 00:27:50,622
I have to go check on
Christina and the gift bags.

584
00:27:50,638 --> 00:27:53,423
Betty, I know I dumped a
lot in your lap this week,

585
00:27:53,436 --> 00:27:55,423
but you gotta know,
you're doing a great job.

586
00:27:55,436 --> 00:27:58,010
No, Daniel,
I am out of my league here.

587
00:27:58,096 --> 00:28:00,032
Listen, when I
started this job,

588
00:28:00,048 --> 00:28:03,803
who was the secretary from Queens
who saved the Fabia account?

589
00:28:03,818 --> 00:28:05,972
- Me.
- And who took all the credit?

590
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:06,781
You.

591
00:28:06,796 --> 00:28:09,053
And this week,
when you get praise for the show,

592
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:10,681
who do you think's
gonna get the credit?

593
00:28:10,698 --> 00:28:12,351
- You.
- No, you!

594
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:13,890
I'm gonna make sure of it.

595
00:28:13,907 --> 00:28:16,302
Look, you just--you really
gotta try and enjoy this.

596
00:28:16,316 --> 00:28:18,022
This is incredible.

597
00:28:21,138 --> 00:28:22,492
I have to go.

598
00:28:22,507 --> 00:28:25,350
Find something to do. Come on.
We are on a deadline!

599
00:28:25,906 --> 00:28:29,180
Sorry. My assistant's
been having a rough day.

600
00:28:29,195 --> 00:28:31,601
You are not the Daniel
Meade I thought you'd be.

601
00:28:31,617 --> 00:28:32,780
Really?

602
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,320
And who are you getting
your information from?

603
00:28:35,358 --> 00:28:37,953
Daniel, I have a little
confession to make.

604
00:28:37,986 --> 00:28:39,292
Okay.

605
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:41,051
Your brother...

606
00:28:42,748 --> 00:28:44,100
Yeah?

607
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,331
I used to date him.

608
00:28:56,907 --> 00:29:00,091
Okay. You... okay.

609
00:29:00,107 --> 00:29:03,150
You can do this.
She is a model.

610
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,963
- I can't do it.
- Shiny things confuse her.

611
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:09,250
Okay, now just flirt with her,
maybe even kiss her,

612
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:11,571
and that bunny skirt will
hop right off of her.

613
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:13,131
Okay, okay, okay!

614
00:29:13,146 --> 00:29:16,221
But if this is anything like my prom
night, you're paying for the therapy.

615
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:17,410
Okay.

616
00:29:17,428 --> 00:29:18,903
Wait. Come back.

617
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,260
Go, go, go.

618
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,612
The kid brother who Alex used to
talk about wouldn't have cared

619
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:29,993
what kind of a day his
assistant was having.

620
00:29:30,008 --> 00:29:33,060
Yeah, well, things change.
People change.

621
00:29:33,077 --> 00:29:34,641
Yes, they certainly do, Danny.

622
00:29:34,655 --> 00:29:36,012
- Thank you for coming.
- Daniel, thank you.

623
00:29:36,046 --> 00:29:38,161
- Good luck with the show.
- Thank you very much.

624
00:29:38,178 --> 00:29:39,942
It's actually Daniel.

625
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:42,612
My brother's the only
one who called me Danny.

626
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:44,201
Do you miss him?

627
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:48,401
We had a
complicated relationship--

628
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:52,003
competitive. I mean,
you know how he was.

629
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:55,241
To be honest-- it might sound
a little weird-- but, um,

630
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:59,641
it's kind of a relief to finally
be out from under his shadow.

631
00:29:59,658 --> 00:30:03,792
Oh, I think you're still
standing in it... Danny.

632
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:08,282
I've got a little
secret for you.

633
00:30:08,296 --> 00:30:10,320
Oh, yeah? What's that?

634
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:16,420
What?

635
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:19,493
What the hell are
you talking about?

636
00:30:19,505 --> 00:30:21,492
Look into my eyes, Danny,
'cause that's about the only thing

637
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:22,810
they couldn't change.

638
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:24,781
Is this some kind of sick joke?

639
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:26,841
What, Becks put--
Becks put you up to this?

640
00:30:26,857 --> 00:30:30,023
Remember Tia Petroni?
The weekend in Vegas I got a little...

641
00:30:30,187 --> 00:30:31,681
crazy?

642
00:30:40,075 --> 00:30:42,340
Ready for the show... Danny?

643
00:30:47,537 --> 00:30:50,441
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

644
00:30:51,198 --> 00:30:52,900
Where is Daniel?

645
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:54,430
Unbelievable. He
should be here.

646
00:30:54,446 --> 00:30:56,350
He knows how important this is.

647
00:30:56,366 --> 00:30:59,823
I just saw him.
Um, he must have, uh...

648
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:01,270
I'll find him.

649
00:31:01,596 --> 00:31:04,542
You're crazy.
How could you do this?

650
00:31:04,556 --> 00:31:06,753
I mean--I can't
even look at you!

651
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:09,341
Then don't look at me,
but I need you to know why I did this.

652
00:31:09,355 --> 00:31:11,532
- Since I was 5, I've known--
- Don't!

653
00:31:11,545 --> 00:31:14,500
Since I was 5, I felt like I've
been dropped in the wrong skin.

654
00:31:14,517 --> 00:31:16,201
This is about
correcting a mistake.

655
00:31:16,215 --> 00:31:18,441
Oh, is that all it is? Really?

656
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:20,482
That's the fast version.

657
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,842
Look, I wanted to talk to you
before I went through with it.

658
00:31:23,856 --> 00:31:25,430
I just didn't have
an opportunity.

659
00:31:25,445 --> 00:31:28,022
Stop. I can't breathe.

660
00:31:28,776 --> 00:31:31,552
You have no idea what you
put the family through.

661
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:33,773
We thought you were dead, Alex.

662
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:36,700
Mom had to bury her son.
She's never recovered.

663
00:31:36,717 --> 00:31:40,510
- And our father, he's--
- What, moved on?

664
00:31:40,747 --> 00:31:42,342
I've noticed.

665
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,562
Nobody's moved on, Alex.

666
00:31:44,576 --> 00:31:47,911
We think about you
every single day.

667
00:31:47,928 --> 00:31:49,821
It's Alexis.

668
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:54,183
And by the way...

669
00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:57,070
hitting on your dead
brother's old girlfriend...

670
00:31:57,088 --> 00:31:58,690
Classy.

671
00:32:03,165 --> 00:32:06,931
Yeah, I'm just coming off a
pretty bad breakup myself.

672
00:32:06,946 --> 00:32:09,351
So, uh, if you're, uh...

673
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:12,943
if you're looking for a little...
mnh-mnh-mnh... rebound action...

674
00:32:12,956 --> 00:32:14,591
What I'm looking
for is my shoes.

675
00:32:14,605 --> 00:32:17,571
Oh, those black platform
peep-toes? Fabulous.

676
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,580
Oh, I see now.

677
00:32:20,598 --> 00:32:23,403
They're hiding the
good stuff back here.

678
00:32:24,046 --> 00:32:26,990
No, no, no.

679
00:32:28,055 --> 00:32:30,741
You don't want this slut.

680
00:32:31,697 --> 00:32:34,492
There is a much
bigger slut in there,

681
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:36,711
and, uh, I want her skirt.

682
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:39,030
Could you just go
get it for me?

683
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:48,393
The horror!

684
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:04,993
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

685
00:33:05,755 --> 00:33:09,012
Oh, my god! Katharine McPhee!

686
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:12,403
Hi, um, I'm Betty Suarez,
Daniel Meade's assistant.

687
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:15,041
Huge "Idol" fan,
by the way-- huge.

688
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:17,281
Totally had the McPheever.

689
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:19,653
Um, oh, have you seen Daniel,
by the way?

690
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:22,152
No, I haven't, but I'm sorry.
Did you say "Suarez"?

691
00:33:23,326 --> 00:33:25,321
Are you Hilda's sister?

692
00:33:25,397 --> 00:33:26,812
Oh, my god, she's awesome.

693
00:33:26,826 --> 00:33:28,991
You know, actually,
I signed a CD for her.

694
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:31,172
Can you give that
to her? Thanks.

695
00:33:33,866 --> 00:33:36,182
Here, get McPheever.

696
00:33:40,377 --> 00:33:42,082
Well, enjoy the show.

697
00:33:42,097 --> 00:33:44,581
Some of us are gonna be watching
it from the unemployment line.

698
00:33:44,598 --> 00:33:45,572
What?

699
00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:47,782
My freakin' sister
just fired me!

700
00:33:47,795 --> 00:33:50,173
Mine just came back
from the dead...

701
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:52,633
and he's hot.

702
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:54,490
What are you talking about?

703
00:33:54,506 --> 00:33:57,302
Just, um, having a bad day.

704
00:33:57,317 --> 00:33:59,972
Yeah, well,
I've had a bad month.

705
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:01,391
Give me that.

706
00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:12,361
Hey.

707
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:14,392
I've been honking out there.
You call for a cab?

708
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:15,940
Actually, I called for you.

709
00:34:15,956 --> 00:34:17,791
Are you Toussaint Duvalier?

710
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:18,970
Yeah. Who are you?

711
00:34:18,987 --> 00:34:22,051
That's not important.
It's, uh, about Constance.

712
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:23,423
Is she here?

713
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:25,691
Do I smell gumbo?
No. No, no, no.

714
00:34:25,707 --> 00:34:28,440
Relax, relax. She's not here.

715
00:34:28,455 --> 00:34:30,481
I just want to talk to you.

716
00:34:30,495 --> 00:34:32,160
Look, Toussaint,

717
00:34:32,225 --> 00:34:34,213
you hurt her really bad,

718
00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:37,552
and she's such a
special person.

719
00:34:37,566 --> 00:34:40,202
Are you sure you want to
give up that much loving?

720
00:34:40,215 --> 00:34:41,910
What is it to you?

721
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:43,873
Well, I...

722
00:34:48,457 --> 00:34:50,333
She's your caseworker,
isn't she?

723
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:51,272
How'd you know?

724
00:34:51,286 --> 00:34:53,291
How do you think me
and her hooked up?

725
00:34:53,307 --> 00:34:55,271
This is how she operates.

726
00:34:55,286 --> 00:34:57,913
First, she'll start showing
up three times a day.

727
00:34:57,925 --> 00:34:58,533
Yeah.

728
00:34:58,545 --> 00:35:02,140
Then she starts moving her
chair closer and closer.

729
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:05,612
Before you know it, she is crying
about the last guy who dumped her.

730
00:35:05,628 --> 00:35:07,273
Exactly!

731
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:08,870
How does she get
away with this?

732
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:12,133
She is the one stamping
"denied" or "approved."

733
00:35:12,148 --> 00:35:13,603
I don't think I
can play this game.

734
00:35:13,615 --> 00:35:16,143
You want your green card?
You don't have a choice, man.

735
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:19,770
You ride that squishy train
until you reach your destination!

736
00:35:23,195 --> 00:35:26,152
No, don't just lick it.
Eat it. That's it.

737
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,170
It's just chewing,
and then a swallow.

738
00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:29,871
That's the way.
Here we go, another one.

739
00:35:29,887 --> 00:35:32,012
Christina, I need
to speak with you.

740
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:35,882
Oh, uh, thank you, Jason.
Now go play with the belts.

741
00:35:36,065 --> 00:35:38,722
I can't do this.
I should just go back to Scotland

742
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:40,820
and knit tea cozies.

743
00:35:40,836 --> 00:35:44,812
Oh, cool it, bagpipes. I chose you
because of your fresh new talent.

744
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:47,263
You picked me because I
did you a shady favor.

745
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:50,683
That doesn't mean you haven't
worked hard and paid your dues.

746
00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:53,613
I have one little
change in the lineup.

747
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:56,241
I'm replacing your final model.

748
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:58,392
You can't just spring
this on me now!

749
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,840
I just did.

750
00:36:00,848 --> 00:36:02,463
Models on in five.

751
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:06,770
Have you seen Daniel?

752
00:36:07,516 --> 00:36:09,261
Where is he?

753
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:12,141
Daniel!

754
00:36:12,365 --> 00:36:13,671
Hilda!

755
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:25,180
Hilda, what the
hell are you doing?

756
00:36:25,337 --> 00:36:26,663
Betty...

757
00:36:26,745 --> 00:36:29,090
Your father's looking for you.
The show's starting.

758
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:31,081
Look, I know this seems...

759
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:33,740
I didn't mean to...

760
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:38,670
I'm gonna go inside, I guess.

761
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:44,033
I thought I told
you to go home.

762
00:36:44,047 --> 00:36:46,060
Hey, I don't take orders
from you anymore.

763
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:47,822
I was fired, remember?

764
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,520
Oh, please, like you ever listen
to my orders to begin with.

765
00:36:50,538 --> 00:36:52,683
What is this--your little
way of getting back at me?

766
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:53,860
Hurts, huh?

767
00:36:53,876 --> 00:36:55,431
Hilda, "Mode" is mine.

768
00:36:55,445 --> 00:36:56,993
You can't have this, too.

769
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,053
What?

770
00:36:58,067 --> 00:37:00,300
Do you have any idea how
hard it has been for me

771
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:02,530
to get these people
to remember my name?

772
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:04,790
You walk in,
and in the first two minutes,

773
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,191
you're everybody's best friend.

774
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:08,633
My entire life,
no one has ever paid attention to me

775
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:09,923
when you're in the same room.

776
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:10,863
Please.

777
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:12,501
You wanna know the truth?

778
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:15,590
I loved watching you sit on that
couch eating that cookie dough,

779
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,660
'cause for the first time,
I was the center of attention.

780
00:37:18,678 --> 00:37:21,173
And by the way,
that was my cookie dough.

781
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:23,752
Well, I am glad to see
you're in my corner.

782
00:37:23,765 --> 00:37:26,701
Oh, Hilda, don't turn this
around and make it about you.

783
00:37:26,716 --> 00:37:29,391
Do you know how hard
it is for me, Betty?

784
00:37:29,577 --> 00:37:32,182
First impressions--
that's all I got.

785
00:37:32,198 --> 00:37:35,901
So if I don't flirt with the
boys and joke with the girls,

786
00:37:35,915 --> 00:37:38,413
they're gonna realize there's
not much behind the tight jeans

787
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,332
and the low-cut top.

788
00:37:42,286 --> 00:37:44,591
That is such crap.

789
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:47,651
Well, it was worth a shot.
You had some good stuff.

790
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:50,101
Now, look, Betty,
give me a break.

791
00:37:50,118 --> 00:37:52,790
Today a few models
laughed at my jokes.

792
00:37:52,808 --> 00:37:55,413
You're the one with the great job,
the great boss,

793
00:37:55,425 --> 00:37:59,513
some cute guy who is totally into you,
by the way.

794
00:37:59,955 --> 00:38:02,960
In the big race,
you're way ahead.

795
00:38:07,776 --> 00:38:10,753
Well, there's plenty of things
that you're good at, too.

796
00:38:12,168 --> 00:38:15,900
Before we set that girl's hair on fire,
it was looking pretty good.

797
00:38:16,285 --> 00:38:17,683
You think?

798
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:22,443
You know, maybe you could get a
real job doing hair or something.

799
00:38:23,228 --> 00:38:26,921
Well, I do work
this every morning.

800
00:38:30,548 --> 00:38:31,783
Hilda.

801
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:35,142
Why didn't you tell
me Henry called?

802
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:36,882
I was trying to protect you.

803
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:40,022
I thought he was some big
city guy who might hurt you.

804
00:38:40,038 --> 00:38:45,840
I'm sorry. I-I should have known
you can take care of yourself.

805
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:11,493
This... is... amazing.

806
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:14,432
And that was our final designer,
Christina McKinney.

807
00:40:20,837 --> 00:40:24,431
And now for the man who's
responsible for all of this--

808
00:40:24,447 --> 00:40:27,032
Mr. Bradford Meade.

809
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:31,891
Thank you, thank you.

810
00:40:31,908 --> 00:40:35,991
First, I'd like to, uh, talk about
the future of Meade publications.

811
00:40:36,008 --> 00:40:37,950
- There have been, uh--
- May I?

812
00:40:39,388 --> 00:40:41,831
I know this is Mr.
Meade's time,

813
00:40:41,848 --> 00:40:43,351
but I have an announcement
I'd like to make

814
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:46,250
about the futur of
this company as well.

815
00:40:47,277 --> 00:40:52,222
Two years ago, the Meade family
lost their eldest son, Alex.

816
00:40:52,238 --> 00:40:53,502
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

817
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:57,812
What Mr. Meade doesn't know is that,
while he may have lost a son,

818
00:40:57,826 --> 00:40:59,882
he gained a daughter.

819
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:09,301
Hi, daddy. I'm back.

820
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:10,613
Alex?

821
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:12,833
You can call me Alexis.

822
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:18,982
Bradford Meade, you're under arrest
for the murder of Fey Sommers.

823
00:41:18,997 --> 00:41:20,843
Put your hands behind
your back, sir.

824
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:22,520
Put your hands
behind your back.

825
00:41:22,538 --> 00:41:23,941
You have the right
to remain silent.

826
00:41:23,975 --> 00:41:26,752
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

827
00:41:26,768 --> 00:41:28,701
You have a right
to an attorney...

828
00:41:31,267 --> 00:41:34,613
That brown envelope that you had
me take to the police station...

829
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:39,323
You used me!

830
00:41:40,515 --> 00:41:42,150
Used you?

831
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,112
I made you a star!

832
00:41:53,618 --> 00:41:55,311
That's Alex?

833
00:41:57,105 --> 00:41:58,421
Yeah.

834
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:02,912
Is it fun having a sister?

835
00:42:04,998 --> 00:42:09,803
