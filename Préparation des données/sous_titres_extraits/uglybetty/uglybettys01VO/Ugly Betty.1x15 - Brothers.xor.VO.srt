1
00:00:00,253 --> 00:00:02,163
Previously on "Ugly Betty"...

2
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:03,279
Have you been here before?

3
00:00:03,289 --> 00:00:04,918
I don't think so.

4
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:07,229
Walter.

5
00:00:08,316 --> 00:00:10,798
In the next few days, something
big is going to happen at "Mode,"

6
00:00:10,828 --> 00:00:13,248
and when it does,
Wilhelmina's going to be in charge,

7
00:00:13,258 --> 00:00:14,734
and when she is,

8
00:00:14,744 --> 00:00:16,544
these are the people
who are staying,

9
00:00:16,554 --> 00:00:18,876
and these are the people
who get the Jimmy Choo.

10
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:22,950
You are looking at the soon-to-be-
crowned editor-in-chief of "Mode."

11
00:00:22,963 --> 00:00:26,139
Do you think dad is
capable of murder?

12
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:28,225
I think your father is
capable of anything.

13
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:31,691
Two years ago,
the Meade family lost their eldest son.

14
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:34,681
While he may have lost a son,
he gained a daughter.

15
00:00:34,698 --> 00:00:37,072
Hi, daddy. I'm back.

16
00:00:37,107 --> 00:00:39,081
- Alex?
- Bradford Meade?

17
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:41,030
You're under arrest for
the murder of Fey Sommers.

18
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:43,001
Is it fun having a sister?

19
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:51,492
Scandal and sex change and murder--
oh, my!

20
00:00:51,507 --> 00:00:54,581
In a move that sent permanent waves
through the fashion community,

21
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:58,073
Alex Meade, the eldest son of
the mega-powerful Meade clan,

22
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:02,413
reappeared friday at "Mode's"
Top Ten to Watch fashion show...

23
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:04,372
as a she.

24
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:08,381
I can't believe all of this is
happening to people that I know.

25
00:01:08,398 --> 00:01:11,682
I heard a rumor that
they keep "it" in a jar.

26
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:17,060
Widely assumed to have met
his maker in a skiing accident,

27
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:19,473
no one was more surprised
to see his son--

28
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:22,762
looking stunning in a fabulous
organza and leather gown--

29
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:24,222
than papa Bradford.

30
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:26,882
Okay, time for you to
get ready for school.

31
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:28,710
- Fine.
- Let me get this straight.

32
00:01:28,727 --> 00:01:31,743
Your boss' brother
wears women's clothes?

33
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:35,162
No, that's a transvestite.
Alexis is a transsexual.

34
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:36,183
What's the difference?

35
00:01:36,198 --> 00:01:39,470
Transsexuals have surgery to reassign
themselves to the opposite sex.

36
00:01:39,486 --> 00:01:40,582
Ouch.

37
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:42,502
The reunion didn't
last long, however,

38
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:46,052
as the senior Meade was promptly
carted off to the big house

39
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:50,132
for the alleged murder of former
"Mode" editor Fey Sommers.

40
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:52,952
Wow. Those hands are too
small to belong to a man.

41
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:55,113
Yeah, and you gotta find out
where she gets her nails done.

42
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,801
Yeah, top of my list.

43
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:59,213
I don't even know what I'm supposed to
be doing. I'm assuming you go to work

44
00:01:59,248 --> 00:02:02,413
when the president of the company's
been arrested for murder, right?

45
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:04,442
I brought you a doughnut.

46
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,301
Walter, it's not
really a good time.

47
00:02:06,316 --> 00:02:07,770
Okay.

48
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:10,700
Well, I also have some other
news that I think you're gonna--

49
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:11,910
I don't know if I have a job.

50
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:13,730
I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.

51
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:17,531
Maybe I'll meet you for lunch.

52
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:20,973
She's, um...
got a lot going on.

53
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:24,412
Sources suspect it was none
other than Alexis Meade

54
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:27,343
who provided the evidence
to put her father away.

55
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:31,232
Meanwhile, no one knows which side
brother Daniel is going to fall on,

56
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:34,263
which brings us to the
all-important question--

57
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:37,430
what's going to
happen at "Mode"?

58
00:02:48,677 --> 00:02:51,732
Miss Meade. Miss Meade, what made
you decide to come back as a woman?

59
00:02:51,748 --> 00:02:53,133
Are you enjoying
wearing dresses?

60
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:54,850
What size breasts
did you go with?

61
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:56,812
How does it feel to
be back at Meade?

62
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:02,472
Fan-freakin'-tastic.

63
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:12,691
Wait!

64
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:16,330
Thanks.

65
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:30,652
So how's it going in there?

66
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,502
Terrific.

67
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:34,890
Just like the club,
except the caddies all carry shivs.

68
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:38,261
- How's your mother doing?
- I wouldn't know.

69
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:40,631
She spent the entire
weekend with Alex.

70
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:42,310
We have to fight him, Daniel.

71
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:45,590
While I'm in here, it's up to you
to keep Meade Publications running.

72
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:46,893
Did you talk to the lawyers?

73
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:50,312
They said the prosecution's got
some pretty strong evidence--

74
00:03:50,626 --> 00:03:53,562
phone logs, e-mails,

75
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:55,310
Fey's car.

76
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:57,900
You do believe I'm innocent,
don't you?

77
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:00,413
I want to.

78
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:20,162
- Hi. Uh, I'm Betty.
- Suarez.

79
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:21,713
My brother's assistant.

80
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,523
I know who you are.

81
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:27,931
Okay, let's just cut to it.

82
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:29,461
They softened the jaw,
slimmed the nose,

83
00:04:29,497 --> 00:04:31,863
lowered the hairline,
shaved the adam's apple,

84
00:04:31,876 --> 00:04:33,210
and then there
are the implants--

85
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:35,322
cheeks, breasts, ass.

86
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:39,060
I'll spare you the more graphic details,
but just to put a rumor to rest,

87
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,890
they don't save "it" in a jar.

88
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:46,911
That's good to know.

89
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:53,730
And, no, I haven't given up smoking.
It's a hormone patch

90
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:55,962
so my mustache
doesn't grow back.

91
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:57,122
Really?

92
00:04:57,137 --> 00:04:58,410
Where'd you get that?

93
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:01,943
Because I have to bleach all the time,
and it is such a pain.

94
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:07,432
"Mode" magazine stands
behind the Meade family.

95
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:10,650
And we are certain all these
matters will be resolved.

96
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,373
In a timely and
appropriate manner.

97
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:14,981
Do you have any job openings?

98
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:17,613
Daniel, the "Times"
called wanting a quote,

99
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:20,010
Dr. Phil called
offering his services,

100
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:22,952
and E! called, wanting to do a
reality show about your family.

101
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:25,870
Tell 'em all no.
Call a staff meeting for 11:00 a.m.

102
00:05:25,886 --> 00:05:28,223
We are way behind on the swimsuit issue,
and I need people

103
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:30,590
to focus on business.
Anything else?

104
00:05:30,606 --> 00:05:32,372
Your sister's in the building
if you want to talk to her.

105
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:33,641
- I don't have a sister.
- Daniel...

106
00:05:33,677 --> 00:05:35,513
Betty, we have an
issue to get out,

107
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:38,140
and I need coffee-- lots of it.

108
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,331
Henry. Hey.
What are you doing here?

109
00:05:44,347 --> 00:05:45,410
Hiding.

110
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:48,182
When paparazzi are stalking accountants,
you know it's bad.

111
00:05:48,198 --> 00:05:49,531
Yeah, I know.

112
00:05:49,547 --> 00:05:50,881
They were following me, too,

113
00:05:50,898 --> 00:05:53,981
and one of them thought that my
glasses and nose were a disguise.

114
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:56,140
I like your glasses
and your nose.

115
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:58,432
Listen, I was wondering,

116
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,961
do you have any interest in seeing "Wicked"
tomorrow night? I have two tickets.

117
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:03,982
Oh, my god. How did you know
that I wanted to see that?

118
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:06,112
Well, you were humming "Popular"
in the elevator on tuesday.

119
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:07,132
You noticed.

120
00:06:07,148 --> 00:06:09,512
After that you said,
"I'm dying to see 'Wicked.'"

121
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:12,670
You know,
green girl who feels like an outsider...

122
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,760
Go figure.

123
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:17,801
I would love to.

124
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,352
It's a date.

125
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:22,071
Oh, um, wait.

126
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:24,301
I-I can't. Uh...

127
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,060
You know, the...

128
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:27,283
Walter.

129
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:29,680
Oh. Sorry.

130
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:30,632
Y-yeah.

131
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:32,673
It's just...
you hadn't mentioned him in a while.

132
00:06:32,688 --> 00:06:34,291
I know, um...

133
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:37,382
it's just--
it's--it's really complicated.

134
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:39,161
Sure.

135
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:43,243
But maybe we can still go,
you know, just as friends.

136
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:45,782
I guess we can do that.

137
00:06:45,798 --> 00:06:48,731
Great. That's perfect.
I'll see you tomorrow.

138
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:50,540
Great.

139
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:54,563
Great. Another friend.

140
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:01,713
I think word is out among
the staff about the takeover.

141
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:03,910
Another suck-up bouquet.

142
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,032
Well, if you wanted to suck up,
Leslie, you should have known

143
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:09,010
I hate peonies.

144
00:07:10,623 --> 00:07:14,309
So I just got an e-mail from
Daniel about a meeting at 11:00.

145
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,835
Why does he still
get to do that?

146
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:17,351
I thought we were in power now.

147
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,760
Relax, Evita.

148
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:20,611
In due time.

149
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:34,981
Daniel,

150
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:38,082
everyone's waiting for you in
the conference room. It's 11:00.

151
00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:40,161
Oh, right. Uh, thanks.

152
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:43,090
I realize the fax machines
have been working overtime

153
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:45,162
with all the résumés
being sent out.

154
00:07:45,177 --> 00:07:46,850
I thought Wilhelmina
was in charge now.

155
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:48,582
- I sent her peonies.
- Yeah, I know,

156
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:50,873
and I switched your card with Leslie's.
You're welcome.

157
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:53,700
...will continue
as it always has.

158
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:58,511
I just ask for your patience
and trust in the coming weeks...

159
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,182
uh, as we get
everything sorted out.

160
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:06,623
Aw. Little Danny's
running a meeting.

161
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:08,621
That is just so cute.

162
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:10,611
Does anyone have a camera?

163
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:14,730
Well, seeing as this is a meeting
for "Mode" employees only,

164
00:08:14,748 --> 00:08:17,690
I don't think my dead brother
falls into that category.

165
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,713
And that's where you're wrong.

166
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:25,141
"In the event of the death or
incapacitation of Bradford Meade,

167
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:30,020
control of Meade Publications transfers
immediately to his eldest son,

168
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:33,501
Alexander Spencer Meade."

169
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:37,110
It's a shame dad never got
around to updating the charter.

170
00:08:37,126 --> 00:08:38,990
I guess he didn't have
anyone he could trust.

171
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:40,080
You can't be serious.

172
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:43,512
I am,
and to show you how serious,

173
00:08:43,526 --> 00:08:46,630
I'd like to present the new
editor-in-chief of "Mode,"

174
00:08:46,646 --> 00:08:49,121
Wilhelmina Slater.

175
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:52,533
Me?

176
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:56,643
Well, I-I'm as
shocked as all of you,

177
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:58,903
and I'm flattered, but...

178
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:01,793
He doesn't work here anymore.

179
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:04,790
Danny, you're fired.

00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:13,501

181
00:09:13,718 --> 00:09:17,403
www.forom.com

182
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:24,911
Thanks again for your time.
I appreciate it.

183
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,203
So what did the lawyers say?
Do I need to start packing?

184
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:31,861
We're not going anywhere.

185
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:33,530
Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about.

186
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:36,062
See, the charter gives control
to Alex Meade, and technically,

187
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,652
Alex is dead.
We can challenge the entire document.

188
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:39,671
That's all we got?

189
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:42,210
Yeah, and the eldest son is
now the eldest daughter.

190
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:43,650
That's also questionable.

191
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:44,800
I'm gonna start packing.

192
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,622
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Betty, we're buying time,

193
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:49,241
and with time,
my father will get out,

194
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,003
and Alex will be gone
from my life again.

195
00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:53,851
Look, Daniel,
if Alexis does end up in power,

196
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:56,342
maybe it'd be better
to be on her side.

197
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:57,783
He fired me.

198
00:09:57,795 --> 00:09:59,961
I fired my sister.
We still talk.

199
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:02,002
It's what families do.
They forgive each other.

200
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,920
Well, then our families
are very different.

201
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,853
Look, Daniel, I know the fact that
your brother is now your sister

202
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:10,340
is a lot to process, so I did some
research to help you understand.

203
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:13,680
Also, I got you the Renee Richards
story. It's old, but it holds up.

204
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:15,131
And "Tootsie."

205
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:17,451
It's not relevant,
but it's a good movie.

206
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:19,700
I'm gonna make this
crystal clear.

207
00:10:19,716 --> 00:10:24,433
I have no interest in
understanding Alexis Meade.

208
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:27,973
Styles wants to know what you
thought about those tankinis.

209
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:31,641
I think somewhere there's a lesbian
water polo team that'll love them.

210
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:34,443
You--you're fired.

211
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:37,073
Anna Wintour returned.
She wants to have lunch.

212
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:40,370
Now she calls.
I left that message in 1998.

213
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:41,660
Tell her I'm busy.

214
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,581
Is this you?

215
00:10:44,146 --> 00:10:47,373
You look better before the haircut,
and you're fired.

216
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:49,083
Oh, this is fun.
I want to do one.

217
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:51,913
- Hey, you. You're fired.
- I don't work here.

218
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:53,702
Not anymore you don't.

219
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:56,343
Hold it. That stays.

220
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:58,050
What's going on?

221
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:00,711
Daniel got an injunction.

222
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:02,833
- The takeover's been halted.
- What?!

223
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:05,813
It'll never hold up in court.
We'll be back on track within a week.

224
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:07,192
Well, what am I supposed
to do till then?

225
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:10,190
You wait.
You bide your time a little longer.

226
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:13,892
I am not going back to being
Daniel's creative director.

227
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:15,592
I worked too hard
to get to the top.

228
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,830
You were there for an hour.

229
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:19,093
Let's see how this
magazine runs without me.

230
00:11:19,105 --> 00:11:20,881
Marc, call for my car.

231
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:23,023
Oh, Willie, you can't leave.
We have a swimsuit issue to finish.

232
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,683
Let Daniel handle it.

233
00:11:24,695 --> 00:11:27,371
These gold pumps will not
step foot in this building

234
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,832
until I rule this magazine!

235
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:35,341
She's a little dramatic,
isn't she?

236
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:36,952
Don't you love it?

237
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,130
Dad?

238
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:43,773
It's so white in here.

239
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:45,432
What are you doing here?

240
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:46,850
Is everything okay?

241
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:49,853
I wanted to talk to you
before Walter gets here.

242
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:51,493
What? Walter's coming?

243
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:54,330
He came by this morning to
tell you he got a promotion.

244
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,732
They offered him assistant
manager of a new Pro Buy.

245
00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:58,362
Oh, my god!

246
00:11:58,376 --> 00:12:00,530
But he's about to turn it down.

247
00:12:00,546 --> 00:12:01,450
Why?

248
00:12:01,468 --> 00:12:04,390
Well, it's in Maryland, and...
you're here.

249
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:06,790
No, he should not do
something like that for me.

250
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:07,861
We'll figure it out.

251
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:10,051
Betty, it's not about
figuring it out.

252
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:13,782
You can't keep stringing
him along if you...

253
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:15,661
if you're not in love with him.

254
00:12:15,678 --> 00:12:18,070
Dad, I don't know
what I am right now.

255
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:21,711
Honey, he wants a
future with you.

256
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:25,553
Unless you plan on standing in
front of a priest with this guy,

257
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:28,212
you need to let him go.

258
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:31,923
Okay, dad, thank you for coming.
I have to go back to work.

259
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:34,173
I was just concerned for you...

260
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:37,000
and I was hoping to get
a look at the she-male.

261
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:39,062
Dad.

262
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,290
What are you doing here?

263
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,673
Oh, my god!
What happened to you?

264
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:55,163
School called me.
He got into a fight.

265
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:56,350
A fight?

266
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:57,873
Wait. Why didn't they call me?

267
00:12:57,885 --> 00:13:00,362
He's my father, okay?
They can call him if they want to.

268
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:02,371
Hey, attitude.

269
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:05,080
Ay, dios mío.
Who did this to you?

270
00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:07,053
I'm going to my room.

271
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,003
Excuse me.

272
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:19,602
Can I help you?

273
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,472
Who are you?

274
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:25,030
I'm Betty Suarez.
I'm Daniel Meade's assistant.

275
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:27,631
Claire Meade,
Daniel Meade's mother.

276
00:13:27,648 --> 00:13:29,420
I win.

277
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:35,231
Hello, Daniel.

278
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:37,432
Mom? What are you doing here?

279
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:40,013
Enjoying this glorious day.

280
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:43,120
The sun is shining.
The air is crisp.

281
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:45,841
Even the hobos have a
spring in their step.

282
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,640
- Are you okay?
- Don't I seem okay?

283
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:52,201
No, you seem... happy.

284
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:55,591
You do realize what's happened to this
family over the last three days, don't you?

285
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:57,593
Look what I bought your sister.

286
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:58,841
You didn't just say that.

287
00:13:58,857 --> 00:14:01,582
With her boobs,
she'll be a knockout in this dress.

288
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:05,071
Oh, and this one
comes in green.

289
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:06,682
Now which do you
think is her color?

290
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:08,250
Are you on pills?

291
00:14:08,268 --> 00:14:10,272
Do I need to call a
sponsor or something?

292
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:11,660
Don't be ridiculous.

293
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:14,192
Mom, dad is in prison.
You have not gone to see him yet.

294
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,141
He won't be there for long.

295
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,210
He didn't do this, you know.

296
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:19,991
Do you have plans for lunch?

297
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:22,561
I want to take both
my children out.

298
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:25,380
Stop acting like
it's easter, okay?

299
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,910
Your family is falling apart.
Do you realize that?

300
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:30,993
My family is coming together.

301
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:35,841
The child I buried and grieved over
for the last two years is alive.

302
00:14:35,857 --> 00:14:39,383
I don't care what
he came back as.

303
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,673
I have him back.

304
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:45,440
Her.

305
00:14:49,585 --> 00:14:52,432
Cancel my appointments.
I have to take my mother to a spa.

306
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:54,151
- Why?
- I can't let her out of my sight.

307
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:57,312
She's acting like she's on the
verge of a nervous breakdown.

308
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:00,273
- She looks fine to me.
- No, trust me, Betty.

309
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:02,552
Her crazy works on
this time delay.

310
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,572
Do you know when Alex died, she spent
three days planning a dinner party,

311
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:07,532
then in the middle of the main course,
she excuses herself,

312
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:10,490
goes upstairs,
swallows a whole bottle of pills?

313
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:15,190
Um, I can take your mother.

314
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,210
What? Really?

315
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:18,723
Yeah. You have all these
phone calls and meetings.

316
00:15:18,737 --> 00:15:20,561
Betty, really,
I can't ask you to do that.

317
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:21,702
Don't be silly, Daniel.

318
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:23,662
Come on, Mrs. Meade.
We're going to the spa.

319
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:26,171
Oh, goody. A new babysitter.

320
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:27,510
We'll take the stairs.

321
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,883
It'll get the toxins out.

322
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:30,683
I like my toxins...

323
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,913
with two olives.

324
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,583
Uh, excuse me. Was that blur
running for the fire exit Betty?

325
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:39,052
I wanted to take her to lunch.

326
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:41,991
Uh, actually, my fault.
I sent her on a special errand.

327
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,561
It's been a crazy day.

328
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:47,352
Oh, 'cause I have a coupon
for the baked potato bar.

329
00:15:47,366 --> 00:15:49,280
It's for two.

330
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:52,981
Sorry. I had a potato
for breakfast.

331
00:15:57,016 --> 00:15:59,670
It's ridiculous. One D.U.I.,

332
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:02,841
you O.D. a couple of times,

333
00:16:02,856 --> 00:16:06,390
show up naked at a garden party, 
and suddenly

334
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:08,961
everyone treats
you like a child.

335
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:11,260
Daniel just wanted to make sure
that you can't hurt yourself.

336
00:16:11,298 --> 00:16:14,600
If I wanted to drink this,
what could you do to stop me?

337
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:18,080
Not bad.

338
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:19,981
So do you go to spas often?

339
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:22,782
Oh, hello.
Um, I'm guessing yes.

340
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:25,143
This is my first
time at the spa.

341
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:27,273
I'm actually really
excited to be here.

342
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,280
My boyfriend
surprised me at work,

343
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:32,190
but it was kind of a lousy surprise because
I think I have to break up with him,

344
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,963
but I've never broken up with anybody
before. I me, I'm a green girl--

345
00:16:34,998 --> 00:16:38,002
Betty, I'm in the tub.

346
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:39,910
You can stop babbling.

347
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:41,173
Okay.

348
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:03,132
Who the hell are you?

349
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:07,210
I'm Evelyn,
your cleaning lady for 13 years.

350
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:08,651
It's nice to meet you.

351
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:12,331
Nice to put a face with the burrito
wrapper you left on my counter.

352
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:16,190
So what are you doing home in
the middle of the afternoon?

353
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:18,962
I thought you were
the editor-in-chief.

354
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:20,312
How did you know that?

355
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:22,673
I snooped.
I saw your business cards.

356
00:17:22,685 --> 00:17:25,262
Well, I'm taking
the afternoon off.

357
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:29,282
Oh, please. Women like us
don't take no afternoons off.

358
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,881
Our careers always come first.

359
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:35,860
Well, maybe women like us

360
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:41,260
need to learn there's more
to life than work, Evelyn.

361
00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:44,083
Caviar?

362
00:17:48,987 --> 00:17:51,011
He still won't tell
me what happened.

363
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,180
Your son showed up to school
today twirling a flag.

364
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,343
What do you think happened?

365
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:58,290
And look at this-- ice-skating lessons,
jazzercise, "music man" auditions.

366
00:17:58,305 --> 00:18:01,501
I know, I know. It's my fault
for letting him be who he is.

367
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:04,522
Bought him unicorn stickers when he was
3. It's been all downhill since then.

368
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:05,843
Go ahead, make jokes, Hilda.

369
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:07,143
And now he's getting beat up.

370
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:08,392
It's time for us
to get practical.

371
00:18:08,425 --> 00:18:09,853
Us?

372
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:14,710
There hasn't been an "us" with Justin
since the backseat of your rented Camaro.

373
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,542
Unh-unh. You can leave now.

374
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:17,681
I will handle this.

375
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:17,756
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:19,120
Hey, whether you
like it or not,

376
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:21,602
he asked me to pick him
up from school today.

377
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:27,050
You got a beer?

378
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:46,640
I didn't pass out in a mexican
whorehouse again, did I?

379
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:51,321
No, um, but
could you check my phone for me?

380
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,881
It could be Daniel.

381
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:58,571
And there's the back part.

382
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:06,201
Its a guy with no chin
and permanent bed head.

383
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:08,203
Oh, that's Walter,
my boyfriend.

384
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,922
He says he has a big
surprise for you,

385
00:19:10,938 --> 00:19:13,470
and then there's what
looks like a smiley face.

386
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:14,832
Yeah, he does that.

387
00:19:14,847 --> 00:19:17,882
He also likes to make a clown
face out of the "a" in Walter.

388
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:19,582
Hot.

389
00:19:20,776 --> 00:19:24,170
This guy is a pain in the ass.
Break up with him already.

390
00:19:24,185 --> 00:19:25,681
It's not that easy.

391
00:19:25,696 --> 00:19:27,210
He loves me.

392
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:31,541
Well, according to his latest message,
he "wuvs" you.

393
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:34,860
Why are you holding on to him?

394
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:39,191
- I'll stand up again.
- Okay! Okay.

395
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,951
Before my mother died,

396
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:45,801
she told me that the most
important thing in life

397
00:19:45,816 --> 00:19:48,370
is to find someone
who loves you,

398
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:51,571
and when you do,

399
00:19:51,586 --> 00:19:54,343
hold on to them no matter what,

400
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:57,490
because in the end,
that's all that really matters.

401
00:19:57,505 --> 00:19:59,901
Honey, if your mother
were still here,

402
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,993
all she'd want to know
is that you're happy,

403
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:06,620
and you're not happy right now.

404
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:10,251
I gotta pee.

405
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:16,851
Thank you all for coming.

406
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:19,720
I'm sure by now you've all
heard about the injunction.

407
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:23,072
I can assure you it's nothing
more than a stalling tactic.

408
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,542
Within a week, I will be assuming
control of Meade Publications.

409
00:20:26,556 --> 00:20:28,831
Actually, that's not true.

410
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:32,890
Ah, my brother Danny, everyone.

411
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:37,002
You probably remember him from his
recent humiliation by Sofia Reyes.

412
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:39,013
When it comes to
family humiliations,

413
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:41,202
I'll definitely take
mine over yours.

414
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:44,360
Oh, and Alex, it's Daniel.

415
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,691
Okay, well,
this has been fun, Danny,

416
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:50,733
but if you have more to say, I suggest
you call your own press conference.

417
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:53,051
Now under my leadership,
Meade Publications will become

418
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:55,511
a force in new media as well.

419
00:20:55,526 --> 00:20:59,900
I have a 4-point plan for
making us a major player in...

420
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:01,952
What are you doing?

421
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,682
I'm calling my own press conference...
right now.

422
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:08,730
Oh, and any of you who come over to
mine gets to see a photo of Alexis

423
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:11,311
with a whole lot of chest hair.

424
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:19,502
And at our cottage,
Alex would drag Daniel out on the lake,

425
00:21:19,518 --> 00:21:23,453
push him out of the boat and
make him swim back to shore.

426
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:26,842
Did I mention this was january?

427
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:29,090
Oh, he lost a pinkie toe.

428
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:31,640
Daniel only has nine toes?

429
00:21:31,926 --> 00:21:36,113
No matter what torture Alex concocted,
Daniel always looked up to him.

430
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,681
His big brother
could do no wrong.

431
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:40,793
- Could I get a spritz?
- Ow!

432
00:21:40,806 --> 00:21:42,123
Ow!

433
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:44,692
Okay, I chose all wrong.

434
00:21:44,706 --> 00:21:47,413
So tell me,
how bad is it between them?

435
00:21:47,427 --> 00:21:49,671
They're, you know...

436
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:51,620
they're adjusting.

437
00:21:51,636 --> 00:21:54,632
- Betty.
- It's like Cain and Abel,

438
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:56,622
if Abel was a woman

439
00:21:56,636 --> 00:21:58,192
who used to be a man.

440
00:21:58,206 --> 00:22:00,023
Ow...

441
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:01,692
Believe it or not,

442
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:05,171
there was actually a time
when we were a real family.

443
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:08,913
Every birthday,
the kids would drag us to Coney Island.

444
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,223
I always hoped they'd want to
do something more civilized

445
00:22:13,238 --> 00:22:17,072
like a nice pheasant hunt.

446
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:21,803
Now I would kill for
bumper cars and corn dogs.

447
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:24,653
It might not be too
late to fix this.

448
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,333
There's one thing that
they have in common.

449
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,840
They both really
care about you.

450
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:41,722
Okay, so you see that stripper?

451
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,043
She used to be a nun,

452
00:22:43,055 --> 00:22:45,283
and she's pregnant with
the butcher's baby,

453
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,632
but she doesn't know that the
butcher is her second cousin.

454
00:22:48,648 --> 00:22:51,513
A story as old as time.

455
00:22:51,968 --> 00:22:54,870
How many boyfriends do I get?

456
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:57,323
One, two, three...

457
00:22:57,945 --> 00:22:59,673
Wilhelmina Slater's office.

458
00:22:59,687 --> 00:23:01,013
I'm in hell.

459
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:02,741
Where are we in putting
the book together?

460
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,000
Are we gonna make the deadline?

461
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,220
I thought you didn't care.

462
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:08,661
That was before I had to watch
"Mork & Mindy" in spanish.

463
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:11,540
I wanna know every detail
that's going on down there.

464
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,843
Well, why don't you
just come down here?

465
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:17,883
I can't just stroll back in.
I made a dramatic exit.

466
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:21,160
But I...
can be there without...

467
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:24,111
actually being there.

468
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:26,103
That makes sense.

469
00:23:26,116 --> 00:23:29,092
Now listen.
Take the orchid on your desk.

470
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:32,960
Turn it slowly clockwise
until I tell you to stop.

471
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:36,071
This isn't gonna squirt me
with water or anything, is it?

472
00:23:37,238 --> 00:23:39,011
Smile.

473
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,920
You might wanna cut
those nose hairs.

474
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:52,661
Nothing will be changing at either
Meade or our flagship, "Mode."

475
00:23:52,678 --> 00:23:56,463
There will be extensive changes
at both Meade and "Mode."

476
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,710
Naturally, people who aren't in
power can't make changes, can they?

477
00:23:59,725 --> 00:24:02,483
And people who are just
playing editor-in-chief

478
00:24:02,495 --> 00:24:05,653
should go back to throwing a
football and whoring around.

479
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:10,092
Are you people really gonna listen
to someone who wet his bed...

480
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:12,290
until he was 15?

481
00:24:12,305 --> 00:24:13,320
Shut up!

482
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:14,621
No, you shut up.

483
00:24:14,635 --> 00:24:17,000
Oh, that's not fair.
I can't hit a girl, can I?

484
00:24:17,016 --> 00:24:18,941
Well, then, I guess you'll
just have to hit yourself.

485
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:20,292
Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting your--

486
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,931
Stop it, the both of you,
right now.

487
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:25,731
There's nothing to see here,
ladies and gentlemen.

488
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:33,803
Hey, nails!

489
00:24:33,818 --> 00:24:35,903
You two are acting
really ridiculous.

490
00:24:35,918 --> 00:24:36,983
- Yeah, but he started it.
- Did not.

491
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,093
- Okay, stop it.
- Did too.

492
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:40,380
Stop it. Cut it out!

493
00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:42,363
This is serious!

494
00:24:42,378 --> 00:24:44,453
Your mother is missing.

495
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:54,202
Okay. All right,
thank you very much.

496
00:24:54,217 --> 00:24:56,811
Her psychiatrist hasn't heard anything.
I gotta go find her.

497
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,733
I'll go.

498
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,903
Since when do you
care about mom?

499
00:24:58,937 --> 00:25:01,470
I love mom.
She's the one person I actually missed.

500
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:04,303
Oh, right, 'cause nothing says "I love
you" like faking your own death, right?

501
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,803
Okay, guys,
try and work together.

502
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:08,970
When we were at the spa,
your mom kept saying that she wanted

503
00:25:09,005 --> 00:25:12,603
to go back to happier times,
like when you were younger.

504
00:25:12,618 --> 00:25:16,502
Is there anywhere
special you used to go?

505
00:25:16,996 --> 00:25:21,073
Well, she-- she used to like
taking us to the clothing museums.

506
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:23,093
Those were stores, dumbass.

507
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,082
She just called them museums
to get us out of school.

508
00:25:25,116 --> 00:25:28,002
Okay, guys, think--
happy times,

509
00:25:28,016 --> 00:25:32,360
like, say, where you used to go
for your birthdays.

510
00:25:33,756 --> 00:25:35,900
- Coney Island.
- Every year.

511
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:37,642
You think that's where she is?

512
00:25:37,658 --> 00:25:39,281
Maybe.

513
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:41,053
- Do you really think--
- Yes!

514
00:25:41,065 --> 00:25:43,960
God, you're so bad at this.
Let's go.

515
00:25:45,895 --> 00:25:49,531
Justin, will you
please come down here?

516
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:57,713
Something tells me he ain't gonna
knock somebody up on his prom night.

517
00:25:57,728 --> 00:25:59,602
What are you still doing here?

518
00:25:59,616 --> 00:26:00,401
Oh, nothing.

519
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:03,452
Just watching you let our
son "be who he wants to be."

520
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:05,751
Fine, Santos, fine. I give up.

521
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:08,711
I will let him be who
you want him to be, okay?

522
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:12,192
And I will take away
everything that he loves.

523
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:14,553
There, that's his life--

524
00:26:14,568 --> 00:26:16,360
a dentist appointment.

525
00:26:16,377 --> 00:26:18,531
At least he'll
still have teeth.

526
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,641
Hilda, I'm telling you,
we're being good parents.

527
00:26:21,658 --> 00:26:23,882
- We're protecting him.
- Stop.

528
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:25,901
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

529
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:32,860
You must be the mother.

530
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:35,533
- Is there a problem?
- I'll say.

531
00:26:35,547 --> 00:26:38,852
Your kid beat up my Bobby.

532
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:44,322
So how long you been spying on me?
Oh, my god.

533
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:46,391
You don't have an orchid
in the stairwell, do you?

534
00:26:46,406 --> 00:26:47,601
Don't worry, dear.

535
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:51,493
I don't find you nearly as
interesting as you find yourself.

536
00:26:52,396 --> 00:26:55,190
Wait. Back up.

537
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:57,623
Turn around.

538
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:02,163
Stop. Is that a party hat?

539
00:27:02,977 --> 00:27:06,001
Are you people
celebrating a birthday?

540
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:08,760
Joelle in styles turned 30.
We had to do something to help.

541
00:27:08,778 --> 00:27:11,363
Birthdays are the
gateway to secret santas

542
00:27:11,377 --> 00:27:13,531
and casual fridays.

543
00:27:13,547 --> 00:27:15,072
Take me to Daniel's office.

544
00:27:15,086 --> 00:27:16,831
Maybe he's actually
doing some work.

545
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:18,821
Ding-dong, the witch is gone.

546
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:20,642
We can finally have cake!

547
00:27:20,976 --> 00:27:23,940
It's for your own good,
you dump truck!

548
00:27:30,006 --> 00:27:31,261
Where is Daniel?

549
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:32,263
I don't know.

550
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:34,251
This is ridiculous.
Take me to Alexis.

551
00:27:34,265 --> 00:27:36,241
Actually, she left
about an hour ago.

552
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:40,603
What? There's a 3:00 at layouts
to nail down the center spread.

553
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,123
Who the hell is
running this magazine?

554
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,610
I don't know.

555
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:54,450
- There she is. Mom!
- I want a ride, mom!

556
00:27:54,468 --> 00:27:56,252
Stay away from the crazy lady.

557
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:58,543
- Mom.
- Get out of the car.

558
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:00,163
Make me.

559
00:28:00,176 --> 00:28:01,262
What's she doing?

560
00:28:01,276 --> 00:28:03,453
I think she wants you to
go in there and get her.

561
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:05,141
Oh, you gotta be kidding.

562
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:12,280
Come on, mom. If you get out of there,
we can all go to a clothing museum.

563
00:28:12,295 --> 00:28:15,100
Seriously, you
are such an idiot.

564
00:28:20,147 --> 00:28:21,722
Well?

565
00:28:22,476 --> 00:28:24,560
Talk to each other.

566
00:28:28,095 --> 00:28:30,210
Wait a minute.
You did this on purpose?

567
00:28:30,226 --> 00:28:32,352
- You think?
- Damn it, mom, we're adults!

568
00:28:32,368 --> 00:28:34,650
You can't manipulate us anymore.
I'm leaving.

569
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,350
Not so fast!

570
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:39,600
You two aren't going anywhere
until you start talking.

571
00:28:39,616 --> 00:28:41,051
You too, missy.

572
00:28:41,257 --> 00:28:42,273
Hey!

573
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,251
I can do this all night long.

574
00:28:46,148 --> 00:28:48,553
Go ahead, start talking.

575
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:53,453
Yes, we're all very glad we
could fill the position.

576
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:56,390
Get layout in my office right now.
We have a 3:00.

577
00:28:56,405 --> 00:28:57,761
What are you doing here?

578
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,452
Well, just because I
don't have the title yet

579
00:29:00,468 --> 00:29:02,461
doesn't mean I'll let
a bad issue go out.

580
00:29:02,478 --> 00:29:03,721
Oh, I get it.

581
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:06,732
Daniel and Alexis are away,
so you can make a dramatic entrance

582
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:08,812
and then be the big hero.

583
00:29:09,316 --> 00:29:11,302
Believe it or not, Marc,

584
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,493
it's not always about me.

585
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:17,911
Are you people faxing résumés?

586
00:29:18,028 --> 00:29:19,340
No.

587
00:29:21,328 --> 00:29:22,622
Now listen up.

588
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:26,141
It's time we all stop worrying about the
future and start focusing on the present.

589
00:29:26,156 --> 00:29:27,970
"Mode" magazine did
not become number one

590
00:29:27,985 --> 00:29:30,643
by honoring people's
personal lives,

591
00:29:30,656 --> 00:29:32,742
so I hope you all
enjoyed the cake,

592
00:29:32,757 --> 00:29:34,921
because it'll be your last meal

593
00:29:34,938 --> 00:29:38,260
until the swimsuit issue
is up to our standards.

594
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:40,183
Amen.

595
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:51,512
Bobby says that
Justin started it.

596
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:55,210
He pulled his hair
and scratched him.

597
00:29:55,225 --> 00:29:56,561
Show 'em the marks, Bobby.

598
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:58,961
Oh, no, no,
that's--that's okay, Bobby.

599
00:29:58,976 --> 00:30:01,371
There is no way that
Justin would do that,

600
00:30:01,387 --> 00:30:03,132
not unless he was provoked.

601
00:30:03,146 --> 00:30:05,001
Maybe not even then.

602
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:06,652
What did Bobby do to you?

603
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:08,733
Nothing to deserve this.

604
00:30:08,747 --> 00:30:11,141
So what if he called
you a "slut mom"?

605
00:30:11,156 --> 00:30:12,882
I'm sure he's not the first.

606
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:14,250
He called me that?

607
00:30:14,265 --> 00:30:15,781
What kind of kid
talks like that?

608
00:30:15,795 --> 00:30:17,251
Can you blame him?

609
00:30:17,266 --> 00:30:18,700
Look at her.

610
00:30:20,145 --> 00:30:21,662
Eyes up, Bobby.

611
00:30:21,675 --> 00:30:23,661
Hey, you know what?
I think it's time for you to go.

612
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,193
From now on, the boys stay away
from each other--end of story.

613
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:29,181
You know, you're a mother.

614
00:30:29,198 --> 00:30:31,252
Why don't you try
lookin' like it?

615
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:35,092
Yeah? You're a woman.
Why don't you try looking like that?

616
00:30:35,107 --> 00:30:36,152
Snap!

617
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:51,001
Mom, are you mad at me?

618
00:30:51,228 --> 00:30:54,032
No. Oh, my god. No, honey.

619
00:30:54,046 --> 00:30:56,942
Hey, why would she
be mad at you, huh?

620
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:59,502
You defended your mother.
I'm proud of you.

621
00:30:59,516 --> 00:31:02,752
But we're gonna have to talk about
that scratching and hair-pulling, huh?

622
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:05,860
For two years you put
us through hell, Alex.

623
00:31:05,876 --> 00:31:07,571
We thought you were dead.

624
00:31:07,587 --> 00:31:10,481
Why couldn't you talk to me about
what you were going through?

625
00:31:10,498 --> 00:31:11,893
I needed a new life.

626
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:14,712
Not all of us were born into the
lives we're supposed to have.

627
00:31:14,728 --> 00:31:16,453
Yeah, well,
we all got new lives,

628
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:18,302
full of grief and rehab.

629
00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:20,451
I never thought I'd
see any of you again.

630
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:23,723
Then Fey died, and I realized I
had a chance to get back at dad.

631
00:31:23,737 --> 00:31:26,710
Get back?
Get back at dad for what,

632
00:31:26,727 --> 00:31:28,051
worshipping you too much?

633
00:31:28,065 --> 00:31:30,011
He wasn't worshipping.

634
00:31:30,027 --> 00:31:33,043
Oh, come on, Alex.
You were the golden child.

635
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,881
Dad did everything with you--

636
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:37,833
boy scouts, football games.

637
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:40,222
Daniel, he figured it out.

638
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:44,652
He hoped tossing a ball
around would change things.

639
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:46,752
When I finally told him
I was gonna do this--

640
00:31:46,765 --> 00:31:49,241
You actually told him?

641
00:31:49,986 --> 00:31:53,722
He said if I went through with
the surgery, I'd lose everything--

642
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,051
the company, the money,

643
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,261
our family...

644
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:03,440
and then just to make sure I
got the message loud and clear,

645
00:32:05,115 --> 00:32:07,631
he said he'd rather
I were dead.

646
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,733
Why didn't you tell me?

647
00:32:11,747 --> 00:32:14,961
Because you're just like dad.

648
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:19,221
I didn't want to
be rejected twice.

649
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,431
This isn't nearly as
fun as it used to be.

650
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:36,220
I guess this was a mistake.

651
00:32:53,736 --> 00:32:56,230
How could he say
I'm like my father?

652
00:32:56,246 --> 00:32:58,781
I am nothing like my father.

653
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:00,831
It's been a long time.

654
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,342
People change.

655
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:04,952
Maybe he just doesn't
know who you are anymore.

656
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:06,531
I would've been there for him.

657
00:33:06,546 --> 00:33:07,821
Of course you would've.

658
00:33:07,835 --> 00:33:10,170
He's your bigger
brother... kinda.

659
00:33:10,185 --> 00:33:15,222
And it's not too late to prove to her
that you're gonna be there for him--her.

660
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:18,581
Can we pick a pronoun
and stick to it, please?

661
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,032
Oh, god.

662
00:33:28,115 --> 00:33:30,412
Guess he's still
waiting for that lunch.

663
00:33:30,428 --> 00:33:31,801
Yeah.

664
00:33:33,348 --> 00:33:35,672
You know what? We went to Coney
Island and we forgot to get hot dogs.

665
00:33:35,706 --> 00:33:36,843
I think we should go back.

666
00:33:36,856 --> 00:33:39,911
Betty, trust me.

667
00:33:39,928 --> 00:33:43,081
It's a lot harder avoiding
people than facing them.

668
00:33:45,376 --> 00:33:46,782
Yeah.

669
00:33:56,356 --> 00:33:57,501
Hey.

670
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:01,820
I'm sorry I'm late.

671
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:06,623
I know most of our conversations
seem to start like that lately...

672
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:09,872
or "sorry I can't make it,"

673
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:13,503
or... "sorry I snapped
at you again," --

674
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:18,760
- It's okay.
- No, Walter, it's not okay.

675
00:34:20,718 --> 00:34:26,373
Look, Walter,
you've meant so much to me.

676
00:34:26,827 --> 00:34:29,133
I don't even know how to tell
you how much you've meant to me,

677
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,023
but lately...

678
00:34:37,218 --> 00:34:38,991
What was that?

679
00:34:40,436 --> 00:34:43,870
I wanted one last kiss
before we ended this.

680
00:34:45,296 --> 00:34:49,192
I'm not stupid. I've known for
a while where this was going.

681
00:34:50,017 --> 00:34:54,853
I guess I...
I just kept hoping that...

682
00:34:56,577 --> 00:34:58,482
I'm so sorry.

683
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:00,962
I took the job in Maryland.

684
00:35:01,876 --> 00:35:03,772
I'm gonna miss you.

685
00:35:05,347 --> 00:35:07,370
I know you don't believe me,

686
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:11,080
but I'm really
gonna miss you, too.

687
00:35:53,848 --> 00:35:57,042
- Hey, Henry.
- Oh, my god.

688
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:00,703
What are you doing here?

689
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:16,811
Good morning, aunt Betty.

690
00:36:19,105 --> 00:36:20,552
Mom?

691
00:36:20,568 --> 00:36:22,081
Come on.
I'm driving you to school.

692
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:23,410
Looking like that?

693
00:36:23,426 --> 00:36:25,863
What? I'm trying something new.

694
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:29,782
I think it's cute in a...
"I have no social life" kind of way.

695
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:31,020
It's hideous,

696
00:36:31,036 --> 00:36:32,091
and so not you.

697
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:34,081
Hey, I am supposed to be a mom.

698
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:36,741
You are a mom--
the mom that always tells me

699
00:36:36,756 --> 00:36:39,672
to be who I am and not care
what other people think.

700
00:36:39,685 --> 00:36:42,182
Don't you have to do that, too?

701
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:46,523
So you really don't
care how I dress?

702
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:49,293
Well, I'm not crazy
about the animal prints,

703
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:51,320
and you're a
little over-accessorized,

704
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:53,573
but you have your own style.

705
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,353
It's cool.

706
00:36:58,018 --> 00:37:02,050
Well, god bless you,
because this was beginning to itch.

707
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:04,742
All right, but to drive you to school,
I'll wear a jacket.

708
00:37:04,757 --> 00:37:06,893
Fine, as long as
I get to pick it.

709
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:21,293
Good morning, Betty.

710
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:24,490
I need you to take my credit card
over to my mom at the Four Seasons.

711
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,430
Apparently she went a little
overboard on her spree yesterday--

712
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:28,741
wore out the magnetic strip.

713
00:37:28,758 --> 00:37:29,792
Do you want me to go right now?

714
00:37:29,828 --> 00:37:32,462
It'd probably be a good idea. She's
trying to buy breakfast with her bracelet.

715
00:37:32,496 --> 00:37:33,963
I'll go right now.

716
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,763
- Hey.
- Hi.

717
00:37:39,776 --> 00:37:41,232
I have the "Wicked" tickets.

718
00:37:41,245 --> 00:37:44,442
Oh, my god. Henry, you have no
idea how excited I am about this.

719
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:47,860
I've been driving my family crazy
singing the songs-- except for Justin.

720
00:37:47,877 --> 00:37:49,851
He's happy to have somebody
to sing the duets with.

721
00:37:49,886 --> 00:37:52,261
Whoops. You gave
me both of them.

722
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:57,322
Listen, last night a friend
from home showed up--

723
00:37:57,826 --> 00:37:59,843
my ex-girlfriend.

724
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:02,091
Look, Betty...

725
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:04,663
I went back for Christmas.

726
00:38:04,855 --> 00:38:08,301
We saw each other, and, uh,

727
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:11,322
it kinda started to
feel like old times.

728
00:38:11,335 --> 00:38:14,523
She came here to try
and make it work,

729
00:38:14,987 --> 00:38:17,802
and you're with Walter.

730
00:38:19,808 --> 00:38:21,101
Wow.

731
00:38:21,118 --> 00:38:23,153
That's, uh...

732
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:25,333
Wow.

733
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:28,792
So you and Walter
can go to the show.

734
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,891
Have fun.

735
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:33,372
Yeah.

736
00:38:33,675 --> 00:38:35,473
Yeah, we will.

737
00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:01,661
Not our finest moment.

738
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:05,272
Probably won't be in the
Meade family Christmas card.

739
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:11,391
So... where do we stand?

740
00:39:11,746 --> 00:39:15,483
Look, no matter
how this turns out,

741
00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:17,863
this is still a family company.

742
00:39:20,008 --> 00:39:24,342
Maybe it wouldn't kill us
to try and work together.

743
00:39:33,548 --> 00:39:35,242
I'm up for it...

744
00:39:36,577 --> 00:39:39,431
long as you stop
staring at my boobs.

745
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:42,952
I'm actually staring
at your adam's apple.

746
00:39:43,595 --> 00:39:45,542
It's nice work.

747
00:40:00,505 --> 00:40:02,562
What show is this?

748
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:06,550
It's called "Wilhelmina
got screwed."

749
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:17,892
- You're not room service.
- No.

750
00:40:17,906 --> 00:40:20,830
But Daniel asked me to
bring you this credit card.

751
00:40:22,848 --> 00:40:25,421
He's a good boy.

752
00:40:25,437 --> 00:40:26,840
Wait...

753
00:40:30,507 --> 00:40:33,410
he's the one who's
still a boy, right?

754
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:37,700
Would you like a bloody mary?

755
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,873
No, it's 10:00 in the morning.

756
00:40:39,886 --> 00:40:41,420
You're right.

757
00:40:41,478 --> 00:40:44,070
I should move on to martinis.

758
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:48,570
So why are you staying
in a hotel room?

759
00:40:50,216 --> 00:40:52,400
My house is empty.

760
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:56,393
A house is not
supposed to be empty.

761
00:40:57,657 --> 00:41:00,853
Well, that's just temporary, right?
I mean,

762
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:03,053
your husband will be out soon.

763
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:04,751
Maybe.

764
00:41:04,898 --> 00:41:06,811
Maybe not.

765
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,112
Mr. Meade is not a murderer.

766
00:41:09,127 --> 00:41:10,351
I know.

767
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:11,961
Good.

768
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:14,133
I know...

769
00:41:14,446 --> 00:41:18,810
because I know who
killed Fey Sommers...

770
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:22,263
and it wasn't Bradford.

771
00:41:25,255 --> 00:41:27,552
It was me.

772
00:41:32,946 --> 00:41:37,321
