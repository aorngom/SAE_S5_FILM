1
00:00:00,411 --> 00:00:02,243
Previously on "Ugly Betty"...

2
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:04,384
We're with immigration
and customs enforcement.

3
00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:05,884
Mr. Suarez,
you're under arrest.

4
00:00:05,894 --> 00:00:09,273
We're having a party up on 25 with
human resources if you're free.

5
00:00:09,283 --> 00:00:11,527
Well, I--I'd love to go,
Henry, but--

6
00:00:11,537 --> 00:00:13,645
- But you have a boyfriend.
- Yeah, I do.

7
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:15,726
Marc, can I have
some privacy please?

8
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:17,031
Come on, Willie.

9
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:19,956
We don't have any secrets,
not anymore.

10
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,550
Come work for my magazine.

11
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:24,967
You'll have your own
assistant within a year.

12
00:00:24,976 --> 00:00:28,125
She told me about the job offer.
I would never stand in your way.

13
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:30,556
You didn't grow up wanting
to be my assistant.

14
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,733
# It's a marshmallow world #
# in the winter #

15
00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:43,071
# When the snow comes... #

16
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,242
Making a list?

17
00:00:44,257 --> 00:00:45,552
Checking it twice?

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,582
A list?

19
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:48,623
You know, naughty or nice.

20
00:00:48,637 --> 00:00:51,220
Most people around here fit
into the first category,

21
00:00:51,237 --> 00:00:53,230
but, you, Betty,

22
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:55,120
you're always nice.

23
00:00:56,865 --> 00:01:00,281
No, it's just Daniel's expense report.
I'm done. Here.

24
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:04,511
# That's how it goes #
# whenever it snows #

25
00:01:04,526 --> 00:01:06,952
# The world is
your snowball... #

26
00:01:06,988 --> 00:01:10,361
No way. 8,479?

27
00:01:10,378 --> 00:01:13,013
That's the exact number of
stars visible from earth...

28
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:15,012
on an ideal night.

29
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:17,683
- How do you--
- Just something I know.

30
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:21,442
Hey.

31
00:01:23,486 --> 00:01:24,990
Is that mistletoe?

32
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:27,250
No, it's just holly.

33
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:32,920
# In winter, #
# it's a marshmallow world #

34
00:01:35,676 --> 00:01:37,073
Wow.

35
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:39,001
You know what, Betty?

36
00:01:39,997 --> 00:01:42,183
You're just the girl
I've been looking for.

37
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:15,493
What time is it?

38
00:02:15,507 --> 00:02:17,773
Oh, my god.
I'm gonna miss my plane.

39
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:20,882
I'm gonna miss you.

40
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:23,441
It's been an
amazing three weeks.

41
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:27,423
I know.
It's all been sort of intense.

42
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:30,200
Actually, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

43
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:34,170
I think we should take a
breather while I'm gone.

44
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:35,743
A breather?

45
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:37,471
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:38,396 --> 00:02:41,741
Well, time to cool off, apart--

47
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:44,393
just to make sure
all this is real.

48
00:02:44,517 --> 00:02:46,920
Oh, I know it's real, Sofia.

49
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,560
I love you.

50
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:51,831
Oh, Daniel,
what do you know from love?

51
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:55,520
Your heart racing...

52
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:57,461
palms sweating...

53
00:02:57,888 --> 00:03:00,390
can barely breathe
when you see me?

54
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:01,662
Actually, yeah.

55
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:02,763
All of that.

56
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:04,761
Well, that's not love.

57
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:07,390
That is hormones, infatuation,

58
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:08,871
good sex.

59
00:03:09,018 --> 00:03:12,672
Look, this isn't just
about sex, Sofia.

60
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:14,800
Although, it has
been pretty good.

61
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:17,620
- Right?
- Daniel.

62
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:20,292
Come on,
I can see a life with you, Sofia.

63
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:22,212
Okay.

64
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:25,122
If this is all real, prove it.

65
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:27,811
Why don't you see other
women while I'm gone?

66
00:03:27,827 --> 00:03:29,891
I'm giving you the green light.

67
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:32,440
I'm serious.

68
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:36,460
And if you don't get sweaty palms
and all that when you're with them,

69
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:38,710
then maybe this is real.

70
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:40,782
I'm not gonna cheat on you

71
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:44,132
just to prove I love you.
That's-- that's crazy.

72
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:50,160
Don't think about
it as cheating.

73
00:03:50,526 --> 00:03:53,872
Think  about it as
proving your theory.

74
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:58,290
See, I need you to convince me

75
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:02,560
that there's only one woman

76
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,660
that you feel this way about--

77
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:06,080
me.

78
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:11,942
It was just a dream, girl.
Don't get too freaked out by it.

79
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:13,761
But I barely even know Henry.

80
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:15,872
I-I don't get it.
I have a boyfriend.

81
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:18,030
Did I ever tell you about
my Jose Mendoza dreams?

82
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:20,751
Ew. That pimply guy who
owns the bakery on 85th?

83
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:23,963
He was really into the Herbalux
digestive tonics. Don't judge.

84
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:26,091
Anyway, about a month ago,
I had this dream.

85
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:28,602
We were going at it in this
big bowl of cake batter.

86
00:04:28,837 --> 00:04:30,561
Never mind.
That's not the point.

87
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:33,421
Anyway, the point is,
do you see us dating now?

88
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:34,772
No, of course not.
You know why?

89
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:36,682
Because it was just a dream,
and dreams don't mean anything.

90
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:39,533
Yeah, but Henry isn't Jose.
It--it's different,

91
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:43,720
and well, we did go on a date once.
Well, lunch.

92
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:47,553
Stop. You go to the Pro Buy party with
Walter tonight and just forget about it.

93
00:04:47,565 --> 00:04:49,220
Hilda, I kissed Henry.

94
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:50,810
In your dream.

95
00:04:50,828 --> 00:04:53,631
As long as you don't actually
do anything, it's harmless.

96
00:04:53,645 --> 00:04:55,472
Betty, we're all tempted
sometimes, right?

97
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:59,062
Just avoid this Henry guy,
and everything will be fine.

98
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:01,441
Justin! Honey, let's go!

99
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:04,702
- Hi.
- Hi.

100
00:05:04,716 --> 00:05:07,031
That girl has the vocal
cords of a large cat.

101
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:08,142
I heard that!

102
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:10,643
And the ears of whatever
animal hears best.

103
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:12,782
A dolphin.
It's just something I know.

104
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:17,822
Dad, did you check in with
the immigration people today?

105
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:20,011
Today, yesterday, tomorrow--

106
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:22,123
isn't it enough that they
dragged me away like a criminal?

107
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,323
Just calm down.
I'm just trying to help you.

108
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:28,953
They sent me to some program 
called I.S.A.P.

109
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:30,742
They're sending over a
caseworker next month.

110
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:32,501
Do we have to talk
about this right now?

111
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:35,142
- Holidays should be about family.
- Hey, watch it!

112
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:37,491
What?

113
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:42,700
Accident-- mom,
Gina, Christmas tree.

114
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,431
Well, it's officially the
start of the holiday season.

115
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,262
You ran over my Christmas tree.

116
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:49,331
Well, I was aiming for you.

117
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:51,100
Besides, you left it in
the middle of the street.

118
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:53,121
I just took it off the tracker.

119
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:55,753
I had to put it somewhere
when I opened the front door.

120
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:57,681
The street is public property,

121
00:05:57,695 --> 00:06:00,720
unlike this house which is not,
so get out!

122
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,230
You better watch out.

123
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:05,521
I know when you're sleeping,
and I know when you're awake.

124
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:10,150
Oops.

125
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,593
Ho, ho, ho!

126
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:17,673
You're late.

127
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:21,920
Love the crystal menorah next to 
the sterling silver Santa. So taboo.

128
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:24,291
Don't you just
love the holidays?

129
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:25,563
They're fabulous.

130
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:28,260
So is Nico coming
home for Christmas?

131
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:30,592
She's spending the break
with her father in Dubai.

132
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:33,281
Besides, you know Christmas
mornings for me are all about

133
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:35,803
- martinis and valium.
- Yummy.

134
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:38,871
You did not just take
the whole wheat bagel.

135
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:40,771
You  know I always eat that one.

136
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:43,143
So sorry, Wil.
I thought we were sharing everything

137
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:46,452
now  that I know about
our mysterious friend.

138
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:47,550
Right?

139
00:06:49,318 --> 00:06:50,290
Right.

140
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:52,110
That is so wrong.

141
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:56,073
I know, believe me. We've been
consistently over budget every issue.

142
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:57,800
We had to cut costs somewhere.

143
00:06:57,815 --> 00:06:59,170
- Boo!
- Boo!

144
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:02,637
Come on. An office party at the office?
Thall be fun.

145
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:05,445
Yeah, like waxing is fun.

146
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:07,766
Thank you for your
enthusiasm, Betty.

147
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:10,372
Actually, Betty has something
to be excited about.

148
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,193
She's been offered an amazing
new position at "MYW,"

149
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,472
and I hope she'll
consider taking it.

150
00:07:19,576 --> 00:07:21,482
We'll be looking
for her replacement.

151
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:24,153
Any of you interested,
leave your résumé with Betty.

152
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:26,161
And that's it. Thank you.

153
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:28,811
Daniel, what are you doing?

154
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:31,532
Something you're far
too loyal to ever do.

155
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:33,462
But if I leave,
who's gonna take care of you?

156
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:35,690
Well, I guess we'll just have
to find someone as good as you.

157
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:36,612
Better get started.

158
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,003
Well, I could try, but if I
don't find the perfect assistant,

159
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:41,191
I'm not going anywhere.
I mean, there's not enough time--

160
00:07:41,226 --> 00:07:44,883
Betty, Betty, sometimes we all
have to take leaps of faith.

161
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:48,223
You know, you being with Sofia
is the best thing for you.

162
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:50,611
Speaking of Sofia,
I'd like to see you in my office.

163
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:52,793
There's something
I need to tell you.

164
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:55,562
Would it be inappropriate
to throw a good-bye party

165
00:07:55,577 --> 00:07:57,131
and not invite her?

166
00:07:57,145 --> 00:07:59,411
You know who would be
perfect for that job?

167
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:02,062
- Anne Hathaway.
- No. Me.

168
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:06,591
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, love your confidence.

169
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:08,763
Wait a second. Sofia wants you
to go out with someone else?

170
00:08:08,796 --> 00:08:11,172
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I know, it's crazy.

171
00:08:11,187 --> 00:08:14,051
She seems to think some other
woman will make my palms sweat

172
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:16,113
and my heart race the
way they do for her.

173
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,153
Well, how do you
know they won't?

174
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:19,923
Look, I--I've never been
good at being faithful,

175
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:24,880
but no one has ever made me
feel the way Sofia does.

176
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:28,903
In fact, I stopped by to see Nigel
on the way to work this morning.

177
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:39,973
I'm through with
being a bachelor...

178
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:41,751
for good.

179
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:43,341
Oh, my god.

180
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:45,101
Are you serious?

181
00:08:45,155 --> 00:08:48,813
I mean, congratulations.
That's great.

182
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,122
Look, I-I know what
you're thinking,

183
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:54,741
but I--it--it's like they say--

184
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:56,360
Well, what do they say?

185
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:58,311
When you know, you know,

186
00:08:58,426 --> 00:09:00,722
and I do know.

187
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:04,360
Well, I'm so happy for you,
Daniel, and for Sofia.

188
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,502
Thanks.

189
00:09:05,768 --> 00:09:07,581
You know, they are just on loan

190
00:09:07,598 --> 00:09:11,111
until I figure out which one
is gonna be perfect for her.

191
00:09:11,128 --> 00:09:14,142
Well, I'm very glad to hear that you have
no intention of testing out her theory

192
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:16,233
because I know how you get
around beautiful women,

193
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:19,421
and Belle Jolie is sending over
their lingerie line today...

194
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:21,052
on their models.

195
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:57,581
Hello?

196
00:09:57,968 --> 00:09:58,993
Yeah.

197
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:00,813
Okay, I'll be right there.

198
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:06,422
Hey, Betty,
I love your sweater.

199
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:08,122
Did you make it yourself?

200
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:11,842
Amanda, look, I need to plan a
"Mode"-worthy party for $500,

201
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:13,113
get Daniel a new assistant

202
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:16,410
and get Justin a signed photo of Lindsay
Lohan in two days. I'm kinda busy.

203
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:18,861
Well, today is,
like, your lucky day.

204
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,981
Hire me. You know you wanna.

205
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,891
Are you serious? After what you
and Daniel have been through?

206
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:26,951
What is the very first
thing I ever said to you?

207
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,341
"Are you the before?"

208
00:10:28,358 --> 00:10:29,512
Okay, the second thing.

209
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:31,781
"Are you delivering
something? "

210
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:34,430
Whatever. The point
is I wanted this job

211
00:10:34,446 --> 00:10:37,152
way before you or Daniel
ever came to "Mode."

212
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:39,702
I have a brain to go with
this beautiful body, Betty.

213
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:42,133
- Yeah. Okay.
- Look, I can prove it to you.

214
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:43,693
Let me help you plan the party.

215
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,271
I've got tons of connections.

216
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:47,183
Plus, I can get
loads of free crap.

217
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,551
Well, I mean,
I could use the help.

218
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:53,321
Okay, you're on. Anything else?

219
00:10:53,337 --> 00:10:55,491
Oh, yeah. Snow's here.

220
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:05,773
Oh, man. I'm sorry. I--

221
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:08,621
It's you.

222
00:11:08,637 --> 00:11:10,771
Henry, hi.

223
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:14,040
You got a little,
um, right here.

224
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,120
Gosh, I'm sorry.

225
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,121
That--that was
very unprofessional.

226
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,423
Uh, let me help
you clean this up.

227
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:25,063
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't worry about it.

228
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:31,243
Actually, Betty, you're just
the girl I've been looking for.

229
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:34,341
Oh, no, um,
I'm sure that there are other girls.

230
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:35,811
Uh, it's about the party?

231
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:38,210
I'm supposed to oversee
the budget, so...

232
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:40,853
guess I'll be on top of you
for the next couple days.

233
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:43,773
Partywise.

234
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:45,692
Oh. Right.

235
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:47,723
All right.

236
00:11:47,737 --> 00:11:49,001
Okay.

237
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,820
Oh, crap.

www.forom.com

240
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,303
The models are here.

241
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:19,680
Show them in.

242
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:21,151
Oh, no.

243
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,221
That's my ex-girlfriend Aerin.

244
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:28,080
She broke my heart.
She was my first.

245
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,701
First supermodel.
God, that girl knew how to--

246
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:32,671
Hey.

247
00:12:33,026 --> 00:12:35,583
Aerin, what are you doing here?

248
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:37,211
Taking my clothes off.

249
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:40,212
Uh, could you give us a second?

250
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:41,540
Sure.

251
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:44,152
Do you need me to stay?

252
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,473
No, I'll be fine.
Just bring the rest of the models in.

253
00:12:47,485 --> 00:12:49,190
Oh, right. That's gonna help.

254
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:58,261
Amanda?  No.

255
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:01,930
No. No.

256
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:03,433
Amanda? 

257
00:13:05,276 --> 00:13:06,273
No.

258
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:21,163
Daniel, um,
I just wanted to let you know

259
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,691
that your girlfriend's plane,
uh, landed safely,

260
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:28,781
and that, um, the photo department
is ready for the models.

261
00:13:28,796 --> 00:13:30,241
Okay, come on.

262
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:37,522
Okay. Bye. See you later.

263
00:13:37,535 --> 00:13:39,950
# Now listen here, chipmunks #
# to this advice #

264
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:42,733
# You better be good #
# and you better be nice... #

265
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:46,093
Betty,  this is Ralph. Wa!

266
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:52,183
He's our store manager-- the man whose
job I one day aspire to hold. No.

267
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:53,332
Good to meet you, Betty.

268
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:54,101
Hi.

269
00:13:54,206 --> 00:13:57,621
And if anyone can fill these size 13s,
it's Walter.

270
00:13:58,677 --> 00:14:00,043
This is my wife Jackie.

271
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:02,151
- A pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

272
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,102
Hey, Paulie, let's get one
of all of us together, yeah?

273
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:05,411
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

274
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:07,220
Squeeze in.

275
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:09,500
There we go.

276
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:11,203
- Thanks.
- Got it.

277
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:14,991
Huh? Betty,
welcome to the Pro Buy family.

278
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:16,001
Thank you.

279
00:14:16,015 --> 00:14:18,912
Walter, should we let
the lovely ladies chat?

280
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:20,641
Stewie made an ice luge.

281
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:21,923
Bring it!

282
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:26,250
Betty, honey,
we have so much in common.

283
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:29,052
I used to work in
Manhattan, too--advertising--

284
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,982
before I married
that adorable lug.

285
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,472
Oh, wow.
Do you still work in advertising?

286
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:35,852
Mm-hmm. Right here at Pro Buy.

287
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:38,942
The commute's a breeze.
I'm not one for lots of travel.

288
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:40,823
Never even been on a plane.

289
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:43,673
Do you miss it-- Manhattan?

290
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:46,891
Never. You'll get
tired of it, too.

291
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:50,442
We're Queens girls,
Betty, born and bred.

292
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,290
We belong here.

293
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:54,992
Thanks.

294
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:10,881
Marc?

295
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:13,222
Marc?

296
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:24,290
Hello?

297
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:25,703
It's me.

298
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:29,682
Have you come up with a
solution to our little problem?

299
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,051
You mean Marc?

300
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:33,941
I'm working on it.
He won't be a problem much longer.

301
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,632
Do what you must
to shut him up.

302
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:41,012
Don't worry.
After I'm done, he will be silenced...

303
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:42,850
permanently.

304
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:35,533
Princess cut...

305
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:37,150
canary...

306
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:39,773
6 carats.

307
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:43,073
Oh, my god.

308
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,781
- Shot?
- Oh, thanks.

309
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:13,572
Jackie, can I ask you a
question that's kinda personal?

310
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:17,261
When did you know that
Ralph was the one?

311
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:19,212
From the first moment.

312
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,650
He took my breath away,

313
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,672
still does.

314
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:26,032
When did you know with Walter?

315
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:31,283
Well, you s-see,
I'm--I'm not sure that I do yet.

316
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:33,613
Oh, don't worry, honey.
There will come a time,

317
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:35,323
and you'll just know.

318
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:36,712
Yeah, I hope so.

319
00:17:37,205 --> 00:17:38,641
For what it's worth,

320
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:42,070
I've heard Walter's sure
he's found the one.

321
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:06,831
Did you go to the funeral home?

322
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:09,721
They never delivered a
casket to the mausoleum.

323
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:13,293
A relative claimed Fey's
remains in the morgue.

324
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:14,821
A relative?

325
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,042
It's all I could dig up.

326
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:25,401
After all of this,
Fey Sommers is really dead.

327
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:29,510
Good morning, sunshine.

328
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,361
Brought you a little present.

329
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,922
Whole wheat.

330
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:37,920
Too late.
Yesterday was carb day.

331
00:18:37,945 --> 00:18:39,150
Of course.

332
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:43,081
So are you sticking around for
the Christmas party later tonight?

333
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:44,812
Unfortunately.

334
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:47,913
You'd better show up, too.

335
00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:50,991
You never know what
surprises might be in store.

336
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:55,260
By the way, Marc,
what is your home address?

337
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,231
W-why?

338
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:01,541
Just sending a special 
delivery your way.

339
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:06,262
'Tis the season.

340
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:15,451
Seriously, I've read every
issue of "Mode" ever.

341
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:17,313
Did you know Danny
Meade dated Fergie

342
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:18,880
back when she was on
"Kids incorporated"?

343
00:19:18,918 --> 00:19:21,442
- Oh, wow.
- See? I am perfect for this job.

344
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:23,133
Okay. We'll let you know.

345
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:25,340
- Not going so well?
- Nope.

346
00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:27,432
I  don't even think the right
person for this job exists.

347
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,043
Well, you never know.

348
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:32,391
Party update-- I got us five
cases of champagne "donated"

349
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:34,442
by this bartender I
know at Double Seven's.

350
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:36,651
A friend of mine who used to
work at Lizzie Grubman's company

351
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,542
got us six white Christmas trees
left over from Diddy's party,

352
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:41,271
and I used to date
this sculptor guy--

353
00:19:41,288 --> 00:19:43,470
would you prefer the ice
sculpture be the "Mode" logo

354
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,221
or a snowflake?
I would go snowflake.

355
00:19:45,237 --> 00:19:47,202
Wow. Snowflake it is.

356
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:50,632
So I guess you can stop all that
boring interviewing then, huh?

357
00:19:50,646 --> 00:19:54,321
Look, Amanda,
I really appreciate the help,

358
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:56,563
but that doesn't
erase you and Daniel.

359
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:59,550
You're just--you're not the right
person for this job. I'm sorry.

360
00:20:12,186 --> 00:20:13,620
Hey, Betty?

361
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:15,973
Ornaments.

362
00:20:16,437 --> 00:20:18,403
Thought it might save
you a couple dollars.

363
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:23,001
Thanks, but, uh, the budget's all set.
Amanda got us some amazing deals.

364
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:25,050
Seems like a lot of
people owe her favors.

365
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:27,223
So basically,
you don't even need me.

366
00:20:27,236 --> 00:20:28,411
Nope.

367
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:32,152
Hey, did you know that
the snow inside these

368
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:34,623
was originally
particles of gold foil?

369
00:20:34,637 --> 00:20:36,441
Sounds beautiful, right?

370
00:20:38,677 --> 00:20:42,470
I had never even seen real snow until
I got off the plane in New York.

371
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:44,951
What? How?

372
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:48,112
Oh, uh,
I grew up in the desert. Tucson.

373
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:52,781
I used to think all snow looked
like gold foil till I got here.

374
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,180
Silly, huh?

375
00:20:58,447 --> 00:21:01,460
No, not at all.

376
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:13,130
Okay, "soccer ball,

377
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:16,553
"renewed subscription to

378
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,121

"for grandpa never to go away"?

380
00:21:22,196 --> 00:21:25,100
Oh, Justin, don't worry.
He's gonna be...

381
00:21:25,796 --> 00:21:28,221
Who moved all our decorations?

382
00:21:31,296 --> 00:21:33,950
And what's Santa
doing to that elf?

383
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:37,450
This has the skank prints of
Gina Gambarro all over it.

384
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,253
Well, you did run over
her Christmas tree,

385
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,690
and Christmas is a time
of love and forgiveness.

386
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,392
Grow up, Tiny Tim.

387
00:21:43,406 --> 00:21:45,320
This means war.

388
00:21:46,616 --> 00:21:48,880
Well, I like the
claymation Rudolph best.

389
00:21:48,896 --> 00:21:50,632
You know they did
that with puppets?

390
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:52,340
They called it animagic.

391
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:54,352
Just something you know?

392
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:58,961
Yeah, I have this weird talent
for remembering useless facts.

393
00:21:58,975 --> 00:22:02,630
Oh, no, it's not useless.
It's... it's cute.

394
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:04,772
Thanks.

395
00:22:14,108 --> 00:22:16,852
I've been meaning to ask,
is this--

396
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:20,393
No, uh, it's just holly. Holly.

397
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,792
You know what? I need to get back
to work so you should probably go.

398
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:25,390
- Uh, okay.
- All right.

399
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:30,052
Uh, I guess I'll see
you at the party?

400
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:32,791
Okay.

401
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,792
Here, take this.

402
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:43,262
What?

403
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,173
It's an ornament. Take it.

404
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:47,341
Hey, watch the hair.

405
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,562
I can explain.

406
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:59,680
Amanda, please just tell me that you
met some rich, gorgeous stockbroker,

407
00:22:59,696 --> 00:23:02,192
you're engaged and you're
running off to Paris together.

408
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:03,470
- Ooh.
- Amanda!

409
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:05,022
What, like that's
so impossible?

410
00:23:05,037 --> 00:23:06,943
That's one of Daniel's rings,
isn't it?

411
00:23:07,268 --> 00:23:10,150
Take it off! We have to put
it back before he notices!

412
00:23:10,168 --> 00:23:13,473
You know those things must be worth,
like, hundreds of dollars.

413
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:15,172
It's stuck!

414
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,401
Just help me get it off!

415
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:20,160
Look, I know what
you're thinking,

416
00:23:20,176 --> 00:23:23,302
but I don't have "feelings"
for Daniel anymore.

417
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:24,571
Ew.

418
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:26,140
Anna Freud might
disagree with that.

419
00:23:26,158 --> 00:23:26,751
What?

420
00:23:26,765 --> 00:23:28,282
Amanda, you're in denial.

421
00:23:28,747 --> 00:23:31,873
Okay, I used to be all
crushed out on Daniel.

422
00:23:31,885 --> 00:23:32,970
I admit it.

423
00:23:32,987 --> 00:23:36,361
But when I found these rings,
it was finally real.

424
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,943
He's ready to commit...

425
00:23:37,955 --> 00:23:39,533
just not to me.

426
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:48,232
You can't deny your
feelings, Betty.

427
00:23:48,248 --> 00:23:50,892
And I don't feel
anything for Daniel,

428
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:52,133
not anymore.

429
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:55,651
I am going to get this ring back to
where it belongs before he finds out.

430
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,133
I promise.

431
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:00,372
Thanks.

432
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:14,042
'Scusey.

433
00:24:16,618 --> 00:24:18,163
28, huh?

434
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:22,182
Hey, you don't know a Marc St.
James, do you?

435
00:24:23,248 --> 00:24:25,043
I hate that guy.

436
00:24:27,878 --> 00:24:30,850
# They have Christmas #
# down in Mexico #

437
00:24:30,866 --> 00:24:33,901
# A lot of places #
# that you wanted to go #

438
00:24:33,915 --> 00:24:37,101
# They have something #
# that you don't know #

439
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:40,213
# Santa's gonna do the mambo, uh! #

440
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:43,472
# Santa's doing the mambo #
# this Christmas #

441
00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:45,422
# Santa's doing the mambo-- #

442
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:48,070
Amanda! Thank god you're here.

443
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:50,401
Are you packing heat?

444
00:24:50,415 --> 00:24:51,811
Always.

445
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:54,491
Amanda, I'm not
flirting with you.

446
00:24:54,616 --> 00:24:56,012
Does anyone here have a gun?

447
00:24:56,026 --> 00:25:00,232
Look around. We're a bunch of unstable,
hungry, back-stabbing bitches.

448
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,220
Do you really think anyone
would sell us guns?

449
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:04,210
Just relax. Have a drink.

450
00:25:04,228 --> 00:25:07,522
That's easy for you to say.
Your boss doesn't want you dead.

451
00:25:14,156 --> 00:25:16,901
# Mambo, Santa, mambo #

452
00:25:16,998 --> 00:25:19,140
# Mambo, Santa, mambo #

453
00:25:19,448 --> 00:25:21,101
Oh, sorry.

454
00:25:21,725 --> 00:25:23,063
Don't spill.

455
00:25:23,077 --> 00:25:25,283
You might electrocute yourself.

456
00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:27,112
I'm just joshing.

457
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:29,262
You look totally...

458
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:31,601
radiant.

459
00:25:31,627 --> 00:25:33,013
Seriously.

460
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:35,611
Well, thank you. You, too.

461
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:38,910
Hey, people actually look like
they're having a good time

462
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:40,942
and the office
looks extraordinary.

463
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:42,513
Well, everything looks better
when you dim the lights

464
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:45,080
and drink a bottle of champagne,
trust me.

465
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:46,282
You really pulled it off.

466
00:25:46,297 --> 00:25:47,520
Thanks.

467
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:49,963
So does that mean you
think I can do your job?

468
00:25:49,978 --> 00:25:53,151
Well, you're obviously smart enough.
You've proven that.

469
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:54,963
But that's not the problem.

470
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:57,321
Daniel needs somebody who's
gonna be looking out for him,

471
00:25:57,337 --> 00:25:58,740
and I don't know
if you've noticed,

472
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:02,400
but his personal life tends to get
in the way of his professional life.

473
00:26:02,415 --> 00:26:04,871
What's Daniel doing with
McSlutty over there?

474
00:26:04,886 --> 00:26:06,893
I thought things were
getting serious with Charo.

475
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:08,782
Exactly. I'll be right back.

476
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:09,863
Wait!

477
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:12,560
Let me run interference with
the trashionista tonight,

478
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:15,162
see if I can't fill
your shoes after all.

479
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,483
# Mambo, Santa, mambo #

480
00:26:17,496 --> 00:26:20,721
# So you wanna mambo, Santa, mambo #

481
00:26:21,035 --> 00:26:23,542
# Come and mambo if you can #

482
00:26:24,636 --> 00:26:26,200
# Shoo-be-doo-be-doo #

483
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:29,270
# Shoo-be-doo-be-doo #
# Shoo-be-doo-be-doo #

484
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:30,870

486
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:36,291

490
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:48,393

# Mambo, Santa, mambo #

491
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:51,941
# Well, here comes Santa #
# with eight reindeers #

492
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:55,083
# He come every time about this year #

493
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:58,373
# here is something #
# that you don't know... #

494
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,190
...a heart for Wilhelmina,

495
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:07,942
courage for Marc and
a brain for Amanda.

496
00:27:11,127 --> 00:27:12,200
Marc?

497
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:15,800
You never saw me.

498
00:27:37,765 --> 00:27:39,061
Oh, crap.

499
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:52,152
Ow!

500
00:27:53,115 --> 00:27:55,952
Betty? Are you okay?

501
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:57,782
Hi.

502
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:02,521
Oh, there it is! Just...

503
00:28:06,095 --> 00:28:08,762
I was just making sure that
everybody was being safe.

504
00:28:08,777 --> 00:28:11,942
You know,
office party hook ups and...

505
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:15,141
That's very responsible of you.

506
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:17,361
- You need some help?
- Yeah.

507
00:28:20,508 --> 00:28:21,722
Thanks.

508
00:28:22,776 --> 00:28:24,441
Hey, you should come
back to the party.

509
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:27,173
Uh, beauty is
making snow angels.

510
00:28:27,185 --> 00:28:29,233
Well, in the plastic snow.

511
00:28:29,818 --> 00:28:31,650
I just came for this.

512
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:38,130
- All right.
- Okay.

513
00:28:38,148 --> 00:28:39,813
- Have fun.
- You, too.

514
00:28:42,115 --> 00:28:45,941
Santa, I've got a thing
for men with beards.

515
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,061
Christina, that's a fake beard.

516
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:49,570
This way.

517
00:28:56,258 --> 00:28:59,802
Oh, god, I thought it was bad enough
watching Santa come down the chimney!

518
00:28:59,815 --> 00:29:00,893
Marc.

519
00:29:02,448 --> 00:29:03,923
Well, hello there.

520
00:29:03,937 --> 00:29:07,202
We've been looking all over for you.
Please come with us.

521
00:29:09,675 --> 00:29:11,123
Love to.

522
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:15,602
There you are.

523
00:29:18,286 --> 00:29:19,810
Here I am.

524
00:29:21,286 --> 00:29:22,763
Doing a little research?

525
00:29:22,776 --> 00:29:25,903
Actually, I just, um,
read it for the articles.

526
00:29:27,127 --> 00:29:28,752
That's really funny.

527
00:29:29,356 --> 00:29:31,283
You know, um...

528
00:29:32,015 --> 00:29:34,210
I'm actually wearing
those right now.

529
00:29:49,866 --> 00:29:53,591
Daniel! Aah! Aah! I need you!
There's a fire in the--

530
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:57,232
Oh, screw it.
Just stop kissing that tramp!

531
00:29:57,246 --> 00:29:59,913
You are practically engaged.

532
00:29:59,928 --> 00:30:01,202
Look at that.

533
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:03,033
Dry as a bone.

534
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,542
I'm sorry, Aerin.
You're--you're beautiful.

535
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,540
I know.

536
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:09,710
But I'm in love
with someone else.

537
00:30:09,805 --> 00:30:11,120
Her?

538
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:15,750
'Cause I'm sure the three of us could,
uh, work something out.

539
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:20,422
Uh, no! Not--not her.

540
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:21,920
Whatever.

541
00:30:21,935 --> 00:30:23,891
There's other men at this party,
you know?

542
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:39,882
I am so good.

543
00:30:39,895 --> 00:30:41,903
Are you girls still
playing that little game?

544
00:30:41,915 --> 00:30:43,820
This is not a game, papi.

545
00:30:44,316 --> 00:30:46,891
You know,
Gina's parents won a cruise to Alaska

546
00:30:46,906 --> 00:30:49,000
in a supermarket sweepstakes.

547
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:51,460
They're gone for a week.

548
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:54,960
Maybe you should give her a break.
You know, forgive, forget.

549
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,162
- A little holiday spirit?
- Yeah, right.

550
00:30:59,005 --> 00:31:00,403
Santa?

551
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:05,891
Well, if it isn't the
bitch who stole Christmas.

552
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,160
Ow! I think it's broken.

553
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:10,402
Well, I hope it was worth it.

554
00:31:10,837 --> 00:31:12,280
Come on.

555
00:31:13,718 --> 00:31:16,290
Why does it always have
to be such a comp--

556
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:19,423
competition with you, Gina?

557
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:21,703
Why? Are you serious?

558
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:23,521
Hilda, we have been competing

559
00:31:23,536 --> 00:31:25,693
ever since you stole my
"electric youth" routine

560
00:31:25,707 --> 00:31:27,793
and won miss junior
teen Queens.

561
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,812
I can never win with you.

562
00:31:29,926 --> 00:31:32,831
I guess I should
just stop trying.

563
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:34,843
Well, yeah.

564
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:40,513
Why don't you come inside?
You need to get some ice on that.

565
00:31:40,707 --> 00:31:42,963
Come on, we got eggnog...

566
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,672
and brandy.

567
00:31:48,247 --> 00:31:50,363
It's a Christmas miracle!

568
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:02,383
Well, will you give
it to him already?

569
00:32:02,425 --> 00:32:06,190
Willie, please. I didn't mean
anything that I said, ever.

570
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:09,522
In fact, I will never say anything
again, if that's what you want.

571
00:32:15,206 --> 00:32:17,350
Merry Christmas, Marc.

572
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:18,952
Huh? What? This?

573
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:22,102
It's a 2007--fresh off the lot.

574
00:32:22,378 --> 00:32:26,482
It's Jody Pennette,
Pennette auto mall.

575
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,521
This is...
bigger than my apartment.

576
00:32:36,948 --> 00:32:40,230
Are you trying to, uh...
buy my silence?

577
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:43,800
'Cause that's a
definite possibility.

578
00:32:46,187 --> 00:32:49,360
So I think I found you
your new assistant.

579
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,161
Really?

580
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:52,290
Who?

581
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:54,851
Well, this might come as
a surprise to you, but...

582
00:32:54,866 --> 00:32:56,210
it's Amanda.

583
00:32:56,227 --> 00:32:57,923
Amanda who?

584
00:32:57,937 --> 00:33:01,033
Amanda--pretty blonde,
kind of a bitch,

585
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:02,771
sits at the big circular desk?

586
00:33:02,786 --> 00:33:05,852
Mmm... nope.
Doesn't ring a bell.

587
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:07,422
I'm serious.

588
00:33:07,975 --> 00:33:10,223
Look, Daniel, I wouldn't leave if I
didn't know there was someone here

589
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:11,440
to protect you.

590
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:13,681
And, tonight,
Amanda proved that she can.

591
00:33:13,696 --> 00:33:15,082
You're right.

592
00:33:15,446 --> 00:33:16,911
She did.

593
00:33:17,936 --> 00:33:21,250
So... if you're serious
about this, then...

594
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:24,732
I guess this is good-bye.

595
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:34,273
You've earned it.

596
00:33:56,157 --> 00:33:58,181
I don't know what to say.

597
00:34:00,068 --> 00:34:02,150
But thank you...

598
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:04,543
for everything.

599
00:34:06,326 --> 00:34:09,063
I'm very proud of you, Betty.

600
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:18,531
You know, you've...

601
00:34:19,498 --> 00:34:22,401
you're destined for
bigger things than this.

602
00:34:44,537 --> 00:34:47,601
Wait, so... the other gifts,

603
00:34:47,617 --> 00:34:49,122
that wasn't you?

604
00:34:49,607 --> 00:34:51,771
Uh, what other gifts?

605
00:34:52,847 --> 00:34:54,180
Never mind.

606
00:34:55,257 --> 00:34:57,171
Merry Christmas, Daniel.

607
00:34:57,335 --> 00:34:59,241
Merry Christmas, Betty.

608
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,323
Sofia, hi.

609
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:39,873
Uh, I've got
something to tell you.

610
00:35:43,148 --> 00:35:45,503
You do take my breath away.

611
00:35:47,906 --> 00:35:50,450
You make my heart beat faster.

612
00:35:52,627 --> 00:35:55,943
You make my palms sweat.

613
00:35:57,357 --> 00:35:59,872
But that doesn't mean
I don't love you.

614
00:36:00,985 --> 00:36:02,923
It means I do.

615
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:09,910
Sometimes your
heart knows things

616
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:12,630
your mind can't explain.

617
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:17,863
And my heart...
doesn't race for anyone else.

618
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:22,223
I love you, Sofia.

619
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:31,452
It's, um, Daniel, by the way.

620
00:37:15,615 --> 00:37:18,773
Betty! Betty!
Where are you going?

621
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:25,570
Oh, I swear to god!

622
00:37:26,598 --> 00:37:28,922
- That is impossible!
- No, it ain't.

623
00:37:28,936 --> 00:37:30,660
Justin, does this
need more glitter?

624
00:37:30,675 --> 00:37:31,690
Absolutely.

625
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,761
Oh, my god, okay, hold on...
show me.

626
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:36,520
Okay, you start over here.

627
00:37:36,536 --> 00:37:38,441
Did hell freeze over?

628
00:37:39,898 --> 00:37:42,730
- Anyway, I just don't understand.
- You start at the middle...

629
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:53,380
Is there an easier
way to do that?

630
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,310
Well, I was gonna wait for it to melt,
but, uh...

631
00:37:57,326 --> 00:37:58,483
So...

632
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:02,472
Betty thinks you should
be my new assistant.

633
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:04,311
Really?

634
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,353
Yep.

635
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,040
I do, too.

636
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,671
Really?

637
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:12,632
You're more than just a pretty face,
Amanda, even I know that.

638
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:16,560
So what do you think,

639
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:18,310
can we do this,

640
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,162
work together?

641
00:38:20,176 --> 00:38:21,691
Absolutely.

642
00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:23,362
Professionals.

643
00:38:25,088 --> 00:38:26,790
Professionals.

644
00:38:32,926 --> 00:38:35,593
Looks like I missed some party.

645
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,132
Ted Lebeau...

646
00:38:50,446 --> 00:38:52,981
Hey, juanita, move your feet.

647
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:58,820
So what's eating you?

648
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:00,292
Ha ha.

649
00:39:01,147 --> 00:39:03,503
Hilda, what if I'm 45

650
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:05,372
and I've still never
been on a plane?

651
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:08,430
If you wanna fly on a plane,
you're gonna fly on a plane.

652
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,080
You're a dreamer, Betty.

653
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:13,360
And look at you-- you're 22 years old,
you already work at "Mode."

654
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:15,431
You can do anything.

655
00:39:16,096 --> 00:39:18,821
Well, I sure hope
you're right...

656
00:39:18,836 --> 00:39:20,250
about everything.

657
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:21,981
What is that? Let me see.

658
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:28,592
Walter loves you
so much, Betty.

659
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:31,603
I wish you could appreciate
that a little bit more.

660
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:32,912
I do.

661
00:39:33,887 --> 00:39:36,153
I just wanna know for sure.

662
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:37,542
You know, like...

663
00:39:38,618 --> 00:39:42,512
like when you heart races
and your palms sweat?

664
00:39:43,236 --> 00:39:46,472
Have you been drinking the
Herbalux extreme energy tea?

665
00:39:48,337 --> 00:39:50,091
That's probably Walter.

666
00:39:51,887 --> 00:39:53,501
Ho, ho, ho.

667
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:55,011
Hey, Walter, merry Christmas!

668
00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:58,682
Hey, uh... how come your Christmas
lights spell "Hilda sucks?"

669
00:39:58,696 --> 00:39:59,892
Don't ask.

670
00:40:02,278 --> 00:40:05,442
So you're ready for
your last present?

671
00:40:06,976 --> 00:40:08,202
Ta da!

672
00:40:08,218 --> 00:40:10,501
Walter! You?

673
00:40:10,518 --> 00:40:11,503
You've been...

674
00:40:11,518 --> 00:40:15,202
Yeah, well, Daniel helped me sneak
the other presents into the office.

675
00:40:15,218 --> 00:40:17,301
I wanted it to be a surprise.

676
00:40:23,418 --> 00:40:24,591
Hello.

677
00:40:24,608 --> 00:40:26,552
Hi, is Betty there?

678
00:40:26,565 --> 00:40:29,503
- Yeah, who's calling?
- It's Henry.

679
00:40:29,516 --> 00:40:32,920
Her, uh... friend from work.

680
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:37,680
Hello? Are you still there?

681
00:40:37,697 --> 00:40:40,130
Yeah, sorry, um...

682
00:40:40,145 --> 00:40:42,842
Actually, you know, Betty's busy.
Can I take a message?

683
00:40:42,856 --> 00:40:47,871
Yes, please.
Tell her, about the party, uh...

684
00:40:49,968 --> 00:40:51,251
You know what?

685
00:40:51,807 --> 00:40:55,141
I just wanted to let her know
that Rudolph's on tomorrow night.

686
00:40:55,526 --> 00:40:58,860
She can call me if
she wants to watch it,

687
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:01,870
you know... together.

688
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:04,933
Uh, okay, I'll tell her.

689
00:41:04,948 --> 00:41:06,951
Thanks, bye.

690
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:22,051
I know that you think I don't "get"
your new life in Manhattan, but...

691
00:41:22,067 --> 00:41:24,151
I wanna try. I...

692
00:41:24,866 --> 00:41:26,790
I wanna be a part of it.

693
00:41:28,665 --> 00:41:30,063
Thank you.

694
00:41:42,515 --> 00:41:44,810
Ooh, candy canes! Yummy.

695
00:41:45,228 --> 00:41:47,333
Don't you just love Christmas?
