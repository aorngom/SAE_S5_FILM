1
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:18,960
Oh! You're up.

2
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:23,649
Good morning.

3
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:26,485
What am I doing here?

4
00:00:26,495 --> 00:00:29,549
I picked you up from a bar
on Union Square last night.

5
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:33,784
Apparently, you sampled a
lot of their fancy scotches.

6
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:34,903
And...

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,113
what-- what happened
after that?

8
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:39,787
I showed up to take you home,
but then I remembered

9
00:00:39,817 --> 00:00:41,982
that it's very easy to choke on
your own vomit, and you live alone,

10
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:43,460
so I brought you here instead.

11
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:49,975
You slept... where?

12
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:51,539
In your arms.

13
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:55,231
Relax, I'm kidding.

14
00:00:55,249 --> 00:00:57,100
On the couch, downstairs.

15
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,633
Oh, great.

16
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:01,393
I mean, th-thanks.

17
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:02,670
So how are you feeling?

18
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:06,440
Like, uh, like my tongue's
wearing a sweater.

19
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,062
Could you please not do that?

20
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:10,913
How did things go with Sofia?

21
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,440
Sofia left...

22
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:16,073
with her perfect boyfriend,

23
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:20,150
who probably proposed to
her with his perfect chin.

24
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,141
What?

25
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:22,993
She wants a family, Betty.

26
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:24,883
She wants to settle down,

27
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:27,491
drive a car with a backseat.

28
00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:29,663
That doesn't sound so terrible.

29
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:33,491
It does when she doesn't see you as
the guy she wants to do that with.

30
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:37,100
I'm not that guy, am I?

31
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:41,630
I mean, maybe you could just
stick to girls who love 2-seaters.

32
00:01:41,788 --> 00:01:43,990
You never called back
that one danish girl.

33
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:46,021
Don't try and fix this, Betty.

34
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:48,002
I lost her.

35
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:49,731
I'm not trying to fix it.

36
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:51,893
I'm just saying, look at me.

37
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:54,392
Last summer I was mopping
up at a cat hospital.

38
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:57,642
Today I'm an executive
assistant at "Mode" magazine.

39
00:01:57,657 --> 00:01:59,823
A lot can change
in a short time.

40
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:03,823
Don't choke. Don't choke.
Don't choke.

41
00:02:06,297 --> 00:02:07,923
No, stay.

42
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:15,261
I don't get it.
It was a holiday.

43
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,503
Clearly, some people thought
it would be an ideal time

44
00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:20,161
to use my office
as a prom limo.

45
00:02:20,177 --> 00:02:22,500
Animals. What'd they do?

46
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,482
They polished off
six gift baskets,

47
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:26,582
rifled through my drawers

48
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:29,501
and made phone
calls from my desk.

49
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:32,332
What's wrong with people?

50
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:34,743
Couldn't they be satisfied
with watching the parade

51
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:37,401
and "The sound of music" for,
like, the 80th time?

52
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:39,550
Is that how you spend
your holidays, Marc?

53
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:41,980
In Schenectady with my family.

54
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,260
And you came back...

55
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:45,480
Uh, right before the Von
Trapps escape the nazis.

56
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:48,883
If I leave before "Edelweiss," I
can be home and in bed by midnight.

57
00:02:48,897 --> 00:02:54,213
Marc, I found this
under my chaise.

58
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:57,580
Why are you calling
me from the office?

59
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,950
She knows we called
from the office.

60
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:15,643
Who on this staff would
willingly eat something

61
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:19,571
that's 15 grams of
fat per serving?

62
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:22,923
Uh, ooh, gee, um...

63
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:24,971
I'll get it.

64
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:27,541
You study the teeth imprints.

65
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,961
Hello? Ah, Bradford.

66
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:34,893
How was your holiday?

67
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:40,193
Oh, no, I'll...
I'll turn it on now.

68
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:45,692
Word has it that Tim, Chloe and
baby Chutney will stop in Gotham

69
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:48,122
for a layover on
their way to Prague.

70
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:51,073
Does this mean that New Yorkers
will be the first to lay eyes

71
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:53,082
on the mysterious baby girl?

72
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:55,772
I hope so, 'cause this New
Yorker is starting to think

73
00:03:55,787 --> 00:04:00,302
that miss Chloe has been "nursing"
a fat slab of swiss cheese.

74
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:04,151
Wait, are you saying they chose
us to reveal baby Chutney?

75
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,052
F abulous.

76
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:09,441
There's the writer contracts
that I have to get out today--

77
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,852
I thought it was
a paid holiday.

78
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:12,602
I'm only gonna be
there till noon.

79
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:13,632
Right.

80
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:17,302
Dad, we've got deadlines,
and Daniel's been distracted.

81
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:19,803
If I wait till monday to finish
the paperwork, it'll be too late.

82
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:21,902
How does your boss take his coffee,
on the rocks?

83
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:24,773
Shh, dad, please.
Just let him sleep.

84
00:04:24,787 --> 00:04:26,881
I'm sure I'll be back
before he even gets up.

85
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:29,130
Oh, but if I'm not, just,
you know, offer him breakfast.

86
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:30,211
Be nice.

87
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,813
Oh, and whatever you do,

88
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:34,432
don't talk about last night,
don't even mention her name.

89
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:36,321
He's in really bad shape.

90
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:38,190
Who is this woman anyway?

91
00:04:38,205 --> 00:04:40,330
What? You don't recognize me?

92
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:44,090
I'm "Memoir of a Geisha"...
before she shaved.

93
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:45,773
You know,
I kinda miss the good old days

94
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,583
when you snuck out in
the middle of the night.

95
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:49,883
Oh, but then we
would've missed this.

96
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:52,211
What do you think, Betty?

97
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:53,900
Can you put me on the
cover of your magazine?

98
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:56,083
Well, I don't really have much
say about what goes on the cover.

99
00:04:56,117 --> 00:04:57,812
Sorry. Good-bye.

100
00:04:57,828 --> 00:04:58,863
Bye.

101
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,400
You, uh, staying for breakfast?

102
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,742
Yeah, sure.

103
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:04,212
Smells great.

104
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:07,390
You're a guest in this house.

105
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:16,050
Sofia?

106
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:18,633
Hola, Betty.

107
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:19,782
What's wrong?

108
00:05:19,798 --> 00:05:22,612
Oh, nothing. I just didn't expect
to see anybody here today.

109
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,931
Oh, when you're launching
a magazine in six weeks,

110
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:26,772
no one gets a friday off.

111
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,380
Is  Daniel coming in, too?

112
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:33,472
Um... I-I'm not sure.

113
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:36,391
I'm leaving him a note.

114
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:38,542
Well, I'll tell
him you stopped by.

115
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:43,513
Betty, I left him three
messages since yesterday,

116
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:46,140
and he has not returned
one of my phone calls,

117
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:48,132
and I'm leaving
tonight for Maine.

118
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:49,282
What's in Maine?

119
00:05:49,296 --> 00:05:50,862
Hunter found some house--

120
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:53,263
six bedrooms, huge porch.

121
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:55,970
Says it's the perfect place
to raise our future family.

122
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:57,301
Sounds nice.

123
00:05:57,588 --> 00:06:00,930
Yeah, knowing Hunter,
he probably found some old captain

124
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:04,220
to marry us in a lobster
boat this weekend.

125
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:05,690
Marry? 

126
00:06:07,398 --> 00:06:09,133
Great. Congratulations.

127
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:11,042
Don't forget to pack
your Dramamine.

128
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:18,440
Betty, I don't know what to do.

129
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:24,232
Listen, I'm not sure
I even want to go.

130
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:27,522
Why?

131
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:29,733
Well, it's complicated.

132
00:06:29,937 --> 00:06:34,472
A month ago,
I didn't know Daniel.

133
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:37,220
Well, have you told him?
Does he know how you feel?

134
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:38,363
Daniel?

135
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,693
Daniel  "so many women,
so little time" Meade?

136
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:44,581
I don't think it would matter.

137
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:46,902
Do you?

138
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,692
What? No. I-I-I don't know.

139
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:51,230
I-I just came here to work.
I'm--I'm working.

140
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:52,942
I have to get back to work.

141
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:56,361
Me, too.

142
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:58,383
Got a plane to catch.

143
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:06,360
Hey, papi,
can you bring one for Justin?

144
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:07,295
Coming right up.

145
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,339
Oh, don't forget
the salt, please.

146
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:10,731
Yep.

147
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:16,140
So what are we putting
under our tree, nothing?

148
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:17,942
Maybe we won't have
one this year.

149
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:20,232
Not everybody has a
Christmas tree, right?

150
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:22,711
Sure, but they're jewish.

151
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,961
We are putting every penny
we got towards helping papi.

152
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:29,883
Do you hear me?

153
00:07:29,897 --> 00:07:33,160
Hilda, one tree is not
gonna break the bank.

154
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:34,883
We always had one.

155
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:37,411
Hey, boss.

156
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:40,561
You okay?

157
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:42,233
Hey, Mr. Suarez.

158
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:45,000
How are you?

159
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:48,300
I'm cooking.
Stay for breakfast.

160
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:50,521
Oh, I'm not much of
a breakfast person.

161
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:51,982
I should probably
just head home.

162
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:53,201
No.

163
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:55,221
No, no, no, no, no, no.

164
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:58,581
Betty told me to
feed and water you.

165
00:07:58,597 --> 00:08:01,261
Stay for coffee.
You look like hell.

166
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:03,481
Come on. There you go.

167
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:05,292
Come on in and sit down.

168
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:08,392
How about right there?

169
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:12,170
Good job. Okay.

170
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:14,520
I'll get you a plate.

171
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:24,090
Yo, I'm Santos, Hilda's, uh...

172
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:26,581
Justin's father.

173
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:29,860
Oh, right. Uh, Daniel.

174
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,953
Meade. Yeah, I know.

175
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:33,963
I saw your picture
in the "Post" once.

176
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:37,083
You dated Angelina when she was
in between boyfriends, right?

177
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:40,293
A real player, bro.

178
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:46,491
Here you go.

179
00:08:48,506 --> 00:08:50,091
How about that?

180
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,442
Enjoy.

181
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,503
It's the second
door on the left.

182
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,092
Oh, hi, Mr. Meade.
You scared me.

183
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:09,511
Did Daniel get my message?

184
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:12,122
- Regarding...
- Baby Chutney.

185
00:09:12,157 --> 00:09:15,400
Tim and Chloe have given us
a 3-hour window to shoot her.

186
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,062
Tim and Chloe?

187
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:20,233
"Mode's" getting the first
pictures of baby Chutney? Shut up!

188
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:22,512
I mean, that's really exciting.

189
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:25,173
Well, it will be if my
son can pull this off.

190
00:09:25,185 --> 00:09:26,781
Is here, isn't he?

191
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:28,553
Wilhelmina has called
in some staffers,

192
00:09:28,565 --> 00:09:30,610
and she's on her way
to greet the plane.

193
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:34,341
Bradford, I was thinking we
approach this from a family angle.

194
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:37,713
You know how the firstborn
changes everything?

195
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:39,411
Yeah, I like that.

196
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:42,520
Tell Daniel that since,
uh, we're short staffed,

197
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:44,813
Sofia has volunteered
to write the copy.

198
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:46,443
They'll make a great team.

199
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:53,612
No, I can't be there, Betty.

200
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:55,593
I'm total mess.

201
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:57,190
Tell her I'm a mess.

202
00:09:57,426 --> 00:09:59,990
Betty, he's a mess.

203
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:04,490
He can't hold down my huevos,
and he's got a fever.

204
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:06,773
Baby who?

205
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:09,821
Oh, no. Baby Chutney.

206
00:10:09,838 --> 00:10:10,810
Baby Chutney?

207
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:13,393
Tim and Chloe have
given us three hours,

208
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:15,412
and Sofia's come up
with a family angle.

209
00:10:15,426 --> 00:10:17,830
Yeah,  Tim and Chloe--
explain that one.

210
00:10:17,846 --> 00:10:19,951
He sleeps with every woman
who brings him coffee,

211
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:21,992
and all of a sudden he's Mr.
Family man?

212
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:23,691
Daniel, are you still drunk?

213
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:26,751
Wait, did--did you say Sofia?

214
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:29,421
My Sofia?
What, is Hunter the chin there, too?

215
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:31,701
Daniel, you have to be here.

216
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,541
I am sick, Betty.
I'm still drunk.

217
00:10:34,557 --> 00:10:36,482
I can't face her.

218
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:39,980
Besides, what do I know about
shooting a family spread, huh?

219
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:42,211
Just cover for me.

220
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,713
No. I can't take
charge of this.

221
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:46,800
What is going on over there?

222
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:49,241
Uh, the tree I
ordered just arrived.

223
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,152
The what?

224
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,961
The Christmas tree
for your family.

225
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:53,432
Why did you get us a tree?

226
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:56,422
Threw up in four rooms of your house.
It's the least I can do, huh?

227
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,331
- Well, how did you--
- It was no big deal.

228
00:10:58,346 --> 00:11:00,550
I just called the
company florist.

229
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:03,270
Oh, my god!

230
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:10,783
Daniel. Daniel?

231
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:14,112
Where is he?

232
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,221
He's on his way.

233
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:17,851
Okay.

234
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,770

www.forom.com

236
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,633
Is he here?

237
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:38,491
I'm sorry. You are...

238
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:41,693
This is Bruno... Jacobs.

239
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:44,242
Stylist.

240
00:11:44,957 --> 00:11:47,183
I was called in to help
him coordinate today.

241
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:49,633
Of course. Mr. Bruno, hi.
I'm Betty. It's--

242
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:50,740
Where's Daniel?

243
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:53,743
He... is... on his way.

244
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:57,622
He's... getting a gift
for baby Chutney.

245
00:11:57,638 --> 00:11:59,250
Isn't that your job?

246
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:01,581
Daniel is very hands-on.

247
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:03,722
The clock is ticking.
We need to talk concept.

248
00:12:03,738 --> 00:12:06,740
You know, we were thinking of
something family oriented.

249
00:12:06,757 --> 00:12:08,561
They're movie stars.

250
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:11,800
Okay, um...
well, what are your thoughts?

251
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:14,573
Uh, Daniel requested that
you share them with me.

252
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:16,993
Really?

253
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,250
Well, my first
thought is coffee.

254
00:12:22,268 --> 00:12:23,780
I like it hot.

255
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:25,571
Okay.

256
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,452
Here, drink this.

257
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:29,970
It'll help.

258
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,793
Thanks. I really
appreciate this.

259
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:36,172
Oh, well, we really appreciate the tree.
It's so nice.

260
00:12:36,186 --> 00:12:39,552
This isn't, uh,
Betty's bonus, right?

261
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:42,663
I say we take the door off the
hinges and cut off some branches.

262
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,701
Yo, Justin, you got a saw?

263
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,431
I got it. I got it.

264
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:50,213
You guys did an awesome
article last december

265
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:52,060
on how to make
icicles out of mylar.

266
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,553
I saved that issue.

267
00:12:53,597 --> 00:12:54,551
Really?

268
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,301
Well, more for the article on
that old queen of hungary.

269
00:12:57,317 --> 00:12:59,221
I didn't know you
were into history.

270
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,313
She used to sleep wrapped up
in a sheet with raw steaks.

271
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:06,121
It removed her toxins.
Her skin was flawless.

272
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:08,400
- Flawless?
- Flawless.

273
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:11,101
Good for her.

274
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:14,362
- Hi.
- Hi.

275
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,922
Tell me something.

276
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,872
How long does Santos
plan on sticking around?

277
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:20,890
Look, papi,
I can take care of myself.

278
00:13:20,906 --> 00:13:23,160
It's not you I'm worried about.

279
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,842
Well, Justin could use another
man in his life right now.

280
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:28,882
What happens when this "man" 
disappears again for three years?

281
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:32,552
Ay, back off, would you?

282
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:35,692
Give him a chance
to be a father.

283
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,602
We can dump the water
on her from behind.

284
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,052
We can shoot high-speed
from a low angle.

285
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:49,342
Genius.

286
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:52,611
Love using that mermaid movie
Chloe did for inspiration.

287
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,520
If the baby doesn't see
the water coming... bam.

288
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:57,191
Pure drama.

289
00:13:57,218 --> 00:13:59,622
You're  gonna dump
water on the baby?

290
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:04,032
Is that the concept?

291
00:14:08,385 --> 00:14:11,713
Do you have a nondairy creamer?

292
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,042
Is everybody on
board with this?

293
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:17,860
I mean, I personally--

294
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:22,001
I think that a wet baby ambush
could be very dynamic...

295
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:27,160
but--but Daniel might not.

296
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:32,770
I'm--I'm gonna check
on that creamer. Okay.

297
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:39,200
Of course I approve, Betty.
This is Bruno Jacobs, hon.

298
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:41,553
He styled Madonna while
she was giving birth,

299
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:43,411
made her belly sweat
look like diamonds.

300
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,162
Tell Daniel to get out of the
way and let him do his work.

301
00:14:57,817 --> 00:15:00,302
Will you excuse me
for just a second?

302
00:15:07,445 --> 00:15:10,931
What about Amanda?
Where did she spend her holiday?

303
00:15:12,506 --> 00:15:14,881
I think she went to Vermont.

304
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:18,470
Oh, I can't wait to
meet baby Chutney.

305
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:21,120
I hope she spits up on something
so I can sell it on the internet.

306
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:23,961
Now how could Amanda get
back from Vermont so fast?

307
00:15:23,977 --> 00:15:25,561
It doesn't make sense.

308
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:31,090
I, uh--oh, excuse-y.
It's Amanda. Hello?

309
00:15:31,568 --> 00:15:34,781
Oh, it's just a text message.

310
00:15:35,306 --> 00:15:39,152
"Forget the cashews. You're the
one who had to be Nancy Drew."

311
00:15:39,997 --> 00:15:41,432
Look, Willie, I can explain--

312
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:43,470
You held that nut in your
hand and you lied to me.

313
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:45,663
- I never touched your cashews.
- Oh, no, that was Amanda.

314
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:49,561
You were the one who made the
phone calls. You are Nancy Drew.

315
00:15:49,628 --> 00:15:51,282
I didn't learn
anything, though.

316
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,113
Then why are you wheezing?

317
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:58,792
You have a friend in a surgical
hospital that likes to chat.

318
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:00,421
About what?

319
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:02,742
I don't know.
I was drinking and dialing.

320
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:05,691
Oh, you are done
dialing, Nancy.

321
00:16:06,018 --> 00:16:08,822
Oh! Oh,
I still had free minutes.

322
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,542
Why are we getting off here?

323
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:13,840
Ma'am, we have a flat. Sorry.

324
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:18,590
We can't stop now. I-I have to go
meet baby Chutney on the tarmac!

325
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:23,960
Dad, is he there?

326
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:25,982
I need to talk to him.
Is he upright?

327
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:28,520
Technically, yes.

328
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:36,270
Is that him?
Betty, let me talk to him.

329
00:16:36,385 --> 00:16:38,112
Let me talk to him.

330
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:42,183
Is that Sofia?
Don't--don't tell her it's me.

331
00:16:42,195 --> 00:16:43,681
I can't deal with this today.

332
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:46,120
Uh--Daniel, Daniel, I can't hear you.
You're breaking up--

333
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,272
I need to ask him--
I need his input on this paper.

334
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:50,733
Just call me when you get off the
gift wrapping floor. Okay, 'bye.

335
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:52,121
Sorry.

336
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:53,812
Did he ask about me?

337
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:56,872
Uh, maybe. I could--
I couldn't hear very well.

338
00:16:58,257 --> 00:16:59,640
Thanks.

339
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:08,190
Brilliant.

340
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:10,480
Metal is a nice homage.

341
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,610
Tim did that King Arthur
movie in armor last year.

342
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:17,483
Oh, if you freeze-frame the fight scene,
he is not wearing a codpiece.

343
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:18,313
I know.

344
00:17:18,325 --> 00:17:20,091
Can this be tailored?

345
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:22,392
Maybe with a blow torch.

346
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:25,141
Let's go with this. It's edgy.

347
00:17:25,156 --> 00:17:28,850
You know, don't you think that we
should wait for Daniel's opinion?

348
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:30,390
Where is he?

349
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:32,811
He's coming.
Uh, but I just don't think

350
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:35,202
that he's gonna go for
a baby in chain-link.

351
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:36,952
It's chain mail.

352
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,941
Whatever. If she
tries to move in that,

353
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:40,563
she's gonna need first aid.

354
00:17:40,577 --> 00:17:43,422
You know?
'Cause their skin, it's--it's tender.

355
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,483
Is this your opinion,
or Daniel's?

356
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:46,593
Daniel's.

357
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,241
Really? I could have
sworn it was yours.

358
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:50,962
And frankly,
I'm not about to take critiques

359
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:53,713
from someone who trims
her bangs with a lighter.

360
00:17:53,726 --> 00:17:57,150
Your boss has five minutes to get here,
or he forfeits his vote.

361
00:18:00,857 --> 00:18:02,011
Look.

362
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:04,220
You made that?

363
00:18:04,235 --> 00:18:07,661
No, that was Betty, years ago,
from her glitter period.

364
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:11,631
Justin, hand me that, will you?

365
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:15,871
What's that supposed to be,
a cow?

366
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,481
Reindeer.

367
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,203
My late wife made this for me,

368
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:22,001
our first Christmas
in New York.

369
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:25,432
Her feet were always cold,
so she put boots on everything.

370
00:18:25,445 --> 00:18:27,741
So most of these are homemade?

371
00:18:27,756 --> 00:18:29,250
Oh, yeah.

372
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:31,011
Careful with that.

373
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,661
It's older than you.

374
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:34,661
Your mother was busy.

375
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:38,252
I made this one when I
was pregnant with Justin.

376
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:40,092
Here come the tears...
just watch.

377
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:41,590
Listen, you. I'm proud of this.

378
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:44,182
It took me weeks to
weave this straw.

379
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:46,633
Hormones'll make you
do strange things.

380
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:49,132
It was the only thing in the
house she didn't try to eat.

381
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:51,641
It's not funny.

382
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:57,151
You wanna hang it?

383
00:18:57,165 --> 00:18:59,051
Uh, sure, yeah. 

384
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:03,010
I'm... kind a new at this.

385
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:07,371
I should... I...

386
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:09,993
I guess I should start
at the top, or...

387
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:12,382
um... bottom?

388
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:15,963
Middle?

389
00:19:15,977 --> 00:19:17,730
Your family never
had Christmas trees?

390
00:19:17,748 --> 00:19:20,193
Oh, yeah, sure.
We had amazing trees--

391
00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:24,731
uh,  electric trains running underneath,
Waterford icicles,

392
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,161
you name it.

393
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,363
Just, uh,
weren't allowed to touch anything.

394
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:40,643
How does that feel?

395
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:42,452
Ow. Like my braces slipped.

396
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:44,411
I can't believe any mother would
let her baby wear that thing.

397
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:46,511
Oh, we're gonna have to find
something safer for the baby to wear,

398
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:48,051
like maybe a plastic bag.

399
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:50,231
Well, isn't there anything in here
that could work for a 6 month old?

400
00:19:50,268 --> 00:19:52,212
No, nothing, nothing--
yes, there is--

401
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:54,100
Kate Moss' spandex dress.

402
00:19:54,116 --> 00:19:57,723
No, no, no, 'cause I'm gonna
have to take it out a bit.

403
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:02,841
Daniel! Hey, listen, so they wanna
put baby Chutney in chain mail,

404
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:05,452
which would rust once
they soaked her.

405
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:06,813
That's great.

406
00:20:06,828 --> 00:20:08,920
No, no, no.
It's not great, Daniel.

407
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:10,672
If she burps,
she'll get lockjaw.

408
00:20:10,685 --> 00:20:12,162
Are you feeling any better?

409
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:13,351
A little.

410
00:20:13,785 --> 00:20:15,830
I'm decorating your tree.

411
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:18,342
You know, your family
has a lot of cool ornaments.

412
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:20,510
I really like your
glitter period.

413
00:20:20,528 --> 00:20:21,563
What?

414
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:23,732
This is all so
new to me, Betty.

415
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:26,801
You know, my family,
we'd go away on Thanksgiving,

416
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:30,350
we'd come back on sunday and
the whole tree was done...

417
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:32,291
by professionals.

418
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:34,341
Daniel, look.
We need decisions.

419
00:20:34,355 --> 00:20:36,621
The whole thing was an
excuse for a photo op.

420
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,110
Are we gonna do this, or what?
Because I'm gonna have

421
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:39,762
to rent a soldering gun.

422
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:40,783
Daniel--

423
00:20:40,797 --> 00:20:43,550
Betty, come on. You're always saying
you want more responsibility.

424
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:44,640
You can do this.

425
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:47,352
And by the time I got in from Queens,
it would all be over anyway.

426
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:49,043
Betty, you're the man.

427
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:50,320
Shoot.

428
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:52,220
Is it three cranberries,
then a popcorn,

429
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:54,260
or three popcorns,
then a cranberry?

430
00:20:54,277 --> 00:20:57,073
I'm not sure, but you better ask Justin,
because he's very particular.

431
00:20:57,218 --> 00:20:58,611
What did he say?

432
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:00,420
He likes what I
do with glitter,

433
00:21:00,448 --> 00:21:03,333
and apparently, I'm the man.

434
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:11,160
I need to get to JFK, fast.

435
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:13,670
No highway, just side streets.

436
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:15,790
Now go.

437
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:18,813
Okay, the only reason I was
there is 'cause I didn't want

438
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:20,450
to go home for Thanksgiving.

439
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:22,200
My mom keeps trying to
set me up with this girl

440
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:24,063
who plays the organ
at their church,

441
00:21:24,078 --> 00:21:28,331
and I just wanted to
watch the parade from...

442
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:31,233
a safe place.

443
00:21:33,785 --> 00:21:35,383
Please say something.

444
00:21:35,398 --> 00:21:37,910
You know the name
of the hospital.

445
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,662
You know the
frequency of my calls.

446
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:47,432
You stepped way over the
line this time, Marc.

447
00:21:48,217 --> 00:21:50,952
I don't know whether I
can protect you anymore.

448
00:21:50,988 --> 00:21:52,792
Protect me from what?

449
00:21:52,805 --> 00:21:57,801
The person you were trying
to call is not amused.

450
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,323
We have a big problem.

451
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:01,402
We do?

452
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,391
The publicist just sent me
a sneak peek at the kid.

453
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,620
I'm gonna need five hours--
a minimum of four.

454
00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:07,491
That's not possible.

455
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:09,020
Well, then, it can't happen.

456
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:09,730
Why?

457
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,062
Because baby Chutney
is butt-ugly.

458
00:22:12,075 --> 00:22:13,501
We're talking scary.

459
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:16,852
Well maybe they just sent you a
bad picture. Maybe it was fuzzy.

460
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:19,181
No, the baby is fuzzy.

461
00:22:19,196 --> 00:22:21,110
This child fell out
of the ugly tree

462
00:22:21,128 --> 00:22:23,803
and hit every single
branch on the way down.

463
00:22:24,015 --> 00:22:26,091
Well, we're talking
about a baby girl.

464
00:22:26,106 --> 00:22:27,930
Who's going to
require extra lighting

465
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:30,290
and yards of tape
for those ears.

466
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,761
Well, they need
to catch a plane.

467
00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:34,633
What don't you understand?
This kid is hideous.

468
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:37,890
Well, maybe your concept of what's
beautiful is a little narrow.

469
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,343
Excuse me?

470
00:22:40,355 --> 00:22:43,820
If you can't find the wonder
and pure joy of a baby,

471
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:47,143
and think that it's edgy to
drown them in chain mail--

472
00:22:47,156 --> 00:22:49,991
I have been styling for
this magazine, missy,

473
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:53,881
since before you bought your
first pair of orthopedic pumps.

474
00:22:54,116 --> 00:22:55,773
Well, maybe that's true,

475
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:58,372
but for the record,
your "brilliant" cover of Courtney Love

476
00:22:58,385 --> 00:22:59,963
leaving rehab in a
wheelbarrow of pills

477
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:02,570
was our lowest selling
issue in 17 years,

478
00:23:02,585 --> 00:23:05,310
so maybe you're not the
right person for the job.

479
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:08,403
Are you firing me?

480
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,391
I didn't say that,

481
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:13,043
but if you don't
think you can do it--

482
00:23:13,055 --> 00:23:15,481
I don't, and clearly you don't,

483
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:18,103
so I suggest that
you find someone

484
00:23:18,116 --> 00:23:20,960
who designs installations
for the Bronx zoo.

485
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:24,023
Oh, tell them to bring treats.

486
00:23:29,268 --> 00:23:31,111
Who the hell is this woman?

487
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:34,280
For today, she's the boss.

488
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,511
Do you know where you're going?

489
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:47,802
Do you know what
JFK stands for...

490
00:23:47,946 --> 00:23:49,590
Pradip?

491
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:52,270
You said take side street.
This is side street.

492
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:54,821
No, this is slow street.

493
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,081
Pathetic.

494
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:00,231
This city will hand
out licenses to anyone.

495
00:24:00,818 --> 00:24:03,242
"What'd you drive
in the old country, a goat?

496
00:24:03,295 --> 00:24:05,210
Here, have a cab."

497
00:24:06,765 --> 00:24:08,481
Why are we stopping?

498
00:24:08,498 --> 00:24:11,392
You getting out.
I do not have to drive nasty person.

499
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,251
Fine. Leave him here.

500
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:15,942
No, you, out. Go.

501
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:19,493
Okay, okay,
maybe we should just...

502
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:32,911
Okay, so...
let's regroup, call another cab

503
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:36,780
and see if they'll
come to, um...

504
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:39,480
Dante's seventh circle of hell.

505
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:41,180
Uh, give me your phone.

506
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,222
- Willie?
- I--oh.

507
00:24:43,236 --> 00:24:45,192
Where's your bag?

508
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:51,340
Why isn't she
answering her phone?

509
00:24:52,677 --> 00:24:53,851
Betty.

510
00:24:54,257 --> 00:24:55,361
Betty.

511
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:59,332
Betty, where the
hell is Daniel, hmm?

512
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:05,390
You've been covering for your
boss all day, haven't you?

513
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:08,873
Well, at least let me help you.

514
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:11,880
No, Sofia, you cannot be more
involved than you already are.

515
00:25:11,896 --> 00:25:13,552
What are you talking about?

516
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:16,860
Daniel's not here
because of you.

517
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,212
- Me?
- Yes.

518
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,722
You broke his heart last night,

519
00:25:19,736 --> 00:25:22,630
so he drank himself sick,
and now he's at my house,

520
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:25,743
making little drummer boys
out of stale marshmallow.

521
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,771
Did Daniel fire Bruno?

522
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:29,382
We weren't on the same page.

523
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,983
Well, Daniel better have a concept,
because team baby Chutney

524
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,333
is waiting in the conference
room for direction.

525
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:38,281
Tell 'em I'll be
there in ten minutes.

526
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,451
I made the frame out
of chenille sticks.

527
00:25:46,465 --> 00:25:48,060
Cool. Where'd you find those?

528
00:25:48,077 --> 00:25:49,383
Fabric store.

529
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:52,122
Yo, what do you say we go outside,
get some fresh air,

530
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:53,612
toss a football?

531
00:25:53,627 --> 00:25:54,940
We're doing the tree.

532
00:25:54,957 --> 00:25:56,570
Yeah, well,
give the glitter a rest.

533
00:25:56,585 --> 00:25:57,682
Come on.

534
00:25:57,697 --> 00:25:59,891
Come out and be a
normal kid for an hour.

535
00:26:00,536 --> 00:26:02,111
I don't know, Santos,

536
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,321
I mean,
if Justin deserts me now,

537
00:26:04,337 --> 00:26:07,273
the tree'll end up looking
like overdressed firewood.

538
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:09,160
I need Justin's eyes.

539
00:26:09,597 --> 00:26:11,131
He's got a gift.

540
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:13,812
Yeah? Well,
there's other things he can learn,

541
00:26:13,827 --> 00:26:15,563
things no one's teaching
him in this house.

542
00:26:15,577 --> 00:26:16,650
What's that supposed to mean?

543
00:26:16,686 --> 00:26:17,821
Just what I said.

544
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:19,610
Who the hell's taking
him to fabric stores?

545
00:26:19,627 --> 00:26:21,102
I am.

546
00:26:21,117 --> 00:26:22,463
Come here.

547
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:26,030
Who are you to come here after
all this time and judge anybody

548
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:27,682
or anything in this family?

549
00:26:27,696 --> 00:26:30,073
You want me to just sit by and
watch him play with chenille

550
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:31,262
and not say something about it?

551
00:26:31,297 --> 00:26:33,560
No, keeping talking. You're gonna
leave here with a few less teeth.

552
00:26:33,598 --> 00:26:35,622
Look, if his own family doesn't
put a stop to this, then I am--

553
00:26:35,657 --> 00:26:37,092
A stop to what?

554
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:40,070
He is comfortable with who he is,
and so am I.

555
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:43,563
If you got a problem with him,
or with us,

556
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:45,272
then you don't belong here.

557
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:47,473
So you call all the shots,
is that it?

558
00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:50,280
Okay, jefe.

559
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:52,122
Adiós.

560
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,753
Don't say I didn't try.

561
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:09,411
You know, I think, uh,
I twisted this wrong.

562
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,233
Was I supposed to braid it?

563
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:30,412
Hi. This is Betty Suarez.
I'm calling from "Mode" magazine.

564
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:47,663
Hold on just one second.
That's disgusting.

565
00:27:47,728 --> 00:27:50,683
Using Tim and Chloe's
first film as inspiration,

566
00:27:50,696 --> 00:27:53,991
we'll recreate a jungle setting
at the Rego Park arboretum.

567
00:27:54,235 --> 00:27:57,371
Ew. Does Daniel really
expect Tim and Chloe

568
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,582
to get out of their
limo in Queens?

569
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,733
Well, Amanda.
They'll be stepping into paradise,

570
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:03,000
the garden of eden.

571
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:05,513
Since the firstborn child
is all about beginnings,

572
00:28:05,528 --> 00:28:07,740
we'll portray the new
parents as the first family,

573
00:28:07,757 --> 00:28:10,121
a 21st century Adam and Eve.

574
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:14,342
How do you not have any cash on you,
not even an A.T.M. card?

575
00:28:14,356 --> 00:28:16,631
There's $17 in my account.
We can go to the bank,

576
00:28:16,648 --> 00:28:18,603
but I swear,
it'll be a social call.

577
00:28:18,617 --> 00:28:20,883
Do taxis even come to
this part of the world?

578
00:28:20,896 --> 00:28:22,360
Where are we?

579
00:28:22,376 --> 00:28:24,460
I don't think we
want to ask them.

580
00:28:25,377 --> 00:28:28,821
Well, we have no choice.
Go ask them to borrow $20.

581
00:28:28,836 --> 00:28:32,092
Something tells me they're more
into receiving than giving.

582
00:28:32,105 --> 00:28:34,123
Never mind. I'll do it.

583
00:28:34,135 --> 00:28:36,651
Pardon me. Hello.

584
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:42,093
Uh, my assistant and I are
in an absurd situation.

585
00:28:42,106 --> 00:28:44,553
The taxi that was taking
us to the airport--

586
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:46,162
Ain't no airport around here.

587
00:28:46,176 --> 00:28:48,583
That's what I told the driver.

588
00:28:48,597 --> 00:28:50,692
I'm Wilhelmina Slater.

589
00:28:52,057 --> 00:28:54,070
"Mode" magazine.

590
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:57,263
Perhaps you don't
subscribe. Anyway--

591
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:59,982
What are you wearin',
girl? Rabbit?

592
00:28:59,995 --> 00:29:03,131
Uh, actually, it's, uh...
albino lynx,

593
00:29:03,146 --> 00:29:06,492
and it's not as warm
as it might seem.

594
00:29:06,507 --> 00:29:10,242
Ooh, girl, shoot. I could make me
some fierce pillows outta this puppy.

595
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:12,352
Okay, back off, girlfriends.

596
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:16,240
Stop pawin' my piece,
'less you gonna show me some benjies.

597
00:29:16,258 --> 00:29:18,512
You... know what I'm sayin'?

598
00:29:19,556 --> 00:29:22,033
- Benjies?
- Where you from?

599
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:24,933
Okay, Lil' Kim.
Visiting hours are over.

600
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:27,483
What, you gonna charge
me to touch you?

601
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:28,721
She's new in the field, girls,

602
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:31,101
and her corner's a long,
long way from here, so...

603
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:33,391
- Oh, so you about to get cut--
- Uh, run.

604
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,062
You better get up outta here.

605
00:29:37,716 --> 00:29:42,223
Where does this go?

606
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:45,443
Near the top. That's where we
hang all of our stocking ones.

607
00:29:45,456 --> 00:29:46,973
We each have our own.

608
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:48,903
This one'll be yours.

609
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:08,980
Oh, gingerbread's done.

610
00:30:15,818 --> 00:30:18,133
Listen, Mr. Suarez, um...

611
00:30:18,565 --> 00:30:21,192
I'm sorry if I stepped
on anyone's toes.

612
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:22,713
I really didn't mean to
get in between your--

613
00:30:22,745 --> 00:30:24,540
Please, Daniel.

614
00:30:25,078 --> 00:30:27,272
I'm thankful you were here.

615
00:30:28,835 --> 00:30:31,102
You'll make a great
father someday.

616
00:30:34,936 --> 00:30:37,413
Tim and Chloe in
the garden of eden?

617
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:40,403
Oh, no, I-I like it, Betty.
It's clever, and--

618
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:42,843
- And what?
- I don't know. It's just...

619
00:30:43,335 --> 00:30:47,700
I wonder if we'd be better
off with something... simpler.

620
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:49,173
I mean, Tim and Chloe--

621
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:52,413
they don't have to be seen
in some exotic jungle.

622
00:30:52,438 --> 00:30:54,952
All right,
they're two working-class kids

623
00:30:54,968 --> 00:30:57,242
who just grew up
to be movie stars.

624
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:59,401
What if we saw them
in a living room,

625
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:02,432
in a row house in
some neighborhood,

626
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:06,781
just doing something
a family does?

627
00:31:08,697 --> 00:31:11,371
I think you should bring
Tim and Chloe here,

628
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:13,230
to your house.

629
00:31:13,298 --> 00:31:15,360
I think he started
drinking again.

630
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,261
I heard that, and I haven't.

631
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,123
Get them to come here.

632
00:31:19,136 --> 00:31:20,980
I've got an idea.

633
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:29,051
Come on, now.
Come on, come on, come on.

634
00:31:30,726 --> 00:31:33,340
Oh, Sofia, it's you.

635
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:35,200
I'm so glad I caught you.
I called your assistant

636
00:31:35,235 --> 00:31:36,723
and she said that you were
leaving for the airport.

637
00:31:36,757 --> 00:31:38,883
I was hoping that you
could maybe drop me off?

638
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,031
Drop you off where?

639
00:31:40,046 --> 00:31:42,182
Home. Daniel's come up with
this whole new concept.

640
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:43,842
We're gonna shoot baby
Chutney in my living room,

641
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,330
sort of an old-fashioned Christmas
portrait around our tree.

642
00:31:46,347 --> 00:31:49,851
That Daniel has so many ideas,
doesn't he?

643
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:52,390
No. I'm serious.
This is his idea.

644
00:31:52,557 --> 00:31:55,283
I need a ride,
and it's on your way.

645
00:31:57,406 --> 00:32:00,900
How the hell did I wind up in
a run-down storefront church

646
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:02,991
in the middle of Queens?

647
00:32:04,607 --> 00:32:07,721
Are we sure there's not
a phone in this place?

648
00:32:07,737 --> 00:32:09,370
Maybe under the altar?

649
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:11,542
It doesn't matter, anyway.
It's too late.

650
00:32:11,757 --> 00:32:13,800
I really screwed up this time.

651
00:32:13,817 --> 00:32:15,391
Oh, please.

652
00:32:15,407 --> 00:32:18,763
Everyone knows traffic's insane
on Thanksgiving weekend,

653
00:32:18,775 --> 00:32:21,763
and besides,
I'm sure Bruno's handling it.

654
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:23,700
You hire the best.

655
00:32:23,715 --> 00:32:25,281
I can't even do my job anymore.

656
00:32:25,295 --> 00:32:27,853
I'm too busy trying
to cover Daniel's.

657
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:29,342
I'm so distracted,

658
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:33,531
spending every minute trying to
take over the whole company.

659
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:35,681
You're trying to take
over the whole company?

660
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,570
I didn't say that.

661
00:32:39,397 --> 00:32:41,323
I would never say that.

662
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:45,970
What I'm saying is,
I'm--I'm not the leader I used to be.

663
00:32:45,985 --> 00:32:49,082
Willie, don't be so
hard on yourself.

664
00:32:49,095 --> 00:32:50,871
You know what they say--

665
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:54,931
it has to get really dark
before it can get light again.

666
00:32:59,027 --> 00:33:01,033
Marc, you are right.

667
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:02,592
Amen.

668
00:33:15,615 --> 00:33:18,303
There's enough in here to
get us back to civilization.

669
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:21,370
Is it all singles?

670
00:33:21,726 --> 00:33:24,742
Poor people are so cheap.

671
00:33:39,258 --> 00:33:40,553
Let's go.

672
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:49,210
Oh, yeah,
this is Betty's house.

673
00:33:49,675 --> 00:33:51,081
Oh, really...?

674
00:33:52,607 --> 00:33:54,941
You couldn't get a
ride with Christina?

675
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:56,831
Okay, look, I lied.

676
00:33:57,467 --> 00:33:59,900
Sofia, I don't want to
have to tell Daniel

677
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:03,680
that you might be coming back on
monday as someone else's wife.

678
00:34:03,785 --> 00:34:06,262
You need to tell
him that yourself.

679
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:20,942
What's the matter?

680
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,512
That was perfume.

681
00:34:26,728 --> 00:34:29,323
I think we should put this
one on the back side.

682
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:32,010
Unh-unh. Touch that
and I break your arm.

683
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:40,733
Is that her?

684
00:34:41,085 --> 00:34:42,211
Yeah.

685
00:34:43,396 --> 00:34:45,172
Now I get it.

686
00:34:46,545 --> 00:34:48,063
Uh, Mr. Suarez?

687
00:34:49,386 --> 00:34:51,193
Uh, how do you say,

688
00:34:51,207 --> 00:34:55,852
"I love you, and I can't live
without you" in spanish?

689
00:34:55,865 --> 00:34:57,812
- Te amo...
- Te amo...

690
00:34:57,825 --> 00:35:00,070
y no puedo vivir sin ti...

691
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:03,773
y no puedo vivir sin ti.

692
00:35:05,996 --> 00:35:07,320
Good luck.

693
00:35:07,456 --> 00:35:08,902
That's english.

694
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:13,472
Wow,

695
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,891
no wonder he wanted
to bring them here.

696
00:35:17,006 --> 00:35:20,291
It looks like Daniel had the
winning idea after all, huh?

697
00:35:20,306 --> 00:35:22,683
You had a few good
ones yourself.

698
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:25,162
Not that we're really
using any of them.

699
00:35:27,678 --> 00:35:29,072
Betty...

700
00:35:29,176 --> 00:35:32,602
you're wasting your time
at "Mode" magazine.

701
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:34,442
What?

702
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:37,081
Why would you say that?

703
00:35:37,707 --> 00:35:40,932
Because you think with your heart,
not just with your head.

704
00:35:40,947 --> 00:35:43,990
It took a lot to stand
up to Bruno Jacobs,

705
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:47,963
and the people at "Mode" are
never going to appreciate that.

706
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:50,561
Come work for my magazine.

707
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:53,270
You'll have your own
assistant within a year.

708
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:55,381
Oh, I-I'm not so
sure about that.

709
00:35:55,397 --> 00:35:58,291
I know it's a little
awkward because of Daniel.

710
00:35:58,307 --> 00:36:00,641
But please, just consider it.

711
00:36:00,656 --> 00:36:02,720
Are you really
offering me a job?

712
00:36:02,737 --> 00:36:05,020
One with a real future.

713
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:18,043
Oh, hey. Where are we?

714
00:36:18,057 --> 00:36:19,453
Uh, just about to start.

715
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:21,191
You may want to
supervise your nephew.

716
00:36:21,206 --> 00:36:23,591
He keeps trying different
hats on the baby.

717
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:26,631
Is... Sofia coming in?

718
00:36:26,647 --> 00:36:28,802
She's on her way to the
airport to meet Hunter.

719
00:36:28,815 --> 00:36:30,551
You might want to
go talk to her

720
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:32,311
while you still can.

721
00:36:36,635 --> 00:36:37,791
Justin!

722
00:36:40,768 --> 00:36:43,300
- Hey.
- Hey.

723
00:36:45,165 --> 00:36:47,201
I've thought about
what you said

724
00:36:47,547 --> 00:36:49,041
outside the club.

725
00:36:50,945 --> 00:36:55,232
Sofia, I come from a
pretty messed up family.

726
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:57,141
I don't exactly have a
great frame of reference

727
00:36:57,156 --> 00:36:59,512
when I hear the words
"happily married."

728
00:36:59,526 --> 00:37:03,300
That being said,
not every family is my family...

729
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:05,142
thank god.

730
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:09,161
Before you rush off
with someone else,

731
00:37:10,306 --> 00:37:12,932
I'd like to at least
have one more chance.

732
00:37:18,887 --> 00:37:23,512
Te amo y no puedo
vivitar sin ti.

733
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,872
You don't believe me?

734
00:37:27,888 --> 00:37:32,613
No, you just said you
loved your camera.

735
00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:42,632
Is this for me?

736
00:37:42,977 --> 00:37:45,020
It's supposed to be a dove.

737
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:48,410
I haven't quite mastered
the art of the jelly bean.

738
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:54,801
Maybe later tonight we could
pick out a tree to hang it on...

739
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:00,911
if that'd be okay.

740
00:38:20,055 --> 00:38:22,123
We're gonna need the
replacement card today.

741
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:23,691
Put on your supervisor.

742
00:38:24,795 --> 00:38:26,723
Wilhelmina Slater's office.

743
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:30,221
Whose idea was it to move a
celebrity shoot to Queens?!

744
00:38:30,236 --> 00:38:32,390
Do I still have a job?
I hear screaming.

745
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:33,760
You're off the hook,

746
00:38:33,776 --> 00:38:36,951
but it's gonna cost you a lot--
at Barney's.

747
00:38:37,788 --> 00:38:40,101
Amanda, leave the roof.

748
00:38:40,857 --> 00:38:42,783
All right, so are you sure
you don't want me to stay

749
00:38:42,816 --> 00:38:44,113
and help finish cleaning up?

750
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:47,663
No. Justin won't let you near
anything Chloe touched anyway.

751
00:38:48,186 --> 00:38:51,852
Well, thanks for
everything you did today.

752
00:38:51,866 --> 00:38:53,600
You're the one
who saved the day.

753
00:38:53,618 --> 00:38:56,890
Yeah, but you're the one
who brought Sofia here.

754
00:38:56,905 --> 00:38:58,221
Well, yes.

755
00:38:58,238 --> 00:39:01,261
I just thought she needed to see
you in a different part of town.

756
00:39:01,277 --> 00:39:02,691
Did she catch her plane?

757
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,391
She decided to
postpone her trip.

758
00:39:05,656 --> 00:39:08,400
Oh, congratulations.

759
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:09,811
Same to you.

760
00:39:09,828 --> 00:39:12,460
She told me about the job
offer she made to you.

761
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:15,490
Oh, no, Daniel.
I--it came out of nowhere.

762
00:39:15,505 --> 00:39:17,933
I didn't even take her seriously.
I would never--I mean--

763
00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:20,011
I could never... leave you.

764
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,530
It's a fantastic opportunity.

765
00:39:22,747 --> 00:39:24,691
- I'm happy--
- Betty...

766
00:39:24,886 --> 00:39:27,622
you didn't grow up wanting
to be my assistant.

767
00:39:27,915 --> 00:39:30,081
You have your own dreams.

768
00:39:30,806 --> 00:39:33,220
I would never
stand in your way.

769
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:45,070
Wilhelmina Slater's office.

770
00:39:45,085 --> 00:39:47,031
Is she there?

771
00:39:47,275 --> 00:39:49,142
Who may I say is calling?

772
00:39:49,155 --> 00:39:52,362
An old friend from college.

773
00:39:57,556 --> 00:40:00,971
Line two,
an old friend from college...

774
00:40:00,987 --> 00:40:03,413
which you never went to.

775
00:40:05,396 --> 00:40:07,010
It's Wilhelmina.

776
00:40:07,028 --> 00:40:11,992
Why is someone named Pradip
answering your cell phone?

777
00:40:12,315 --> 00:40:15,053
Marc, can I have some
privacy, please?

778
00:40:15,068 --> 00:40:16,752
Come on, Willie.

779
00:40:16,768 --> 00:40:19,482
We don't have any secrets,
not anymore.

780
00:40:19,528 --> 00:40:21,571
We're in this together, right?

781
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,630
I'll call you right back.

782
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,552
What do you want, Marc?

783
00:40:30,056 --> 00:40:33,113
Job security, a title...

784
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:37,052
and my own company credit
card would be nice.

785
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,722
Wow, he was such a nice guy.

786
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:41,030
He's not at all
what I expected.

787
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:42,731
Well, he was a
little hung over.

788
00:40:42,747 --> 00:40:45,382
Mija, I'm not
talking about Daniel.

789
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:47,202
I'm talking about Tim.

790
00:40:47,216 --> 00:40:49,021
There was a movie star
in my house today.

791
00:40:49,038 --> 00:40:49,742
There were two!

792
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:51,523
So when do we see the pictures?

793
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,503
I guess when they
hit the newsstands.

794
00:40:54,516 --> 00:40:56,420
I might be able to sneak
home a copy, though,

795
00:40:56,436 --> 00:40:57,813
if I'm still working there.

796
00:40:57,827 --> 00:40:59,520
Wait a minute--
what do you mean, "if"?

797
00:40:59,538 --> 00:41:00,892
Well, I could be
working at "Mode,"

798
00:41:00,927 --> 00:41:04,051
or I could be working
at another magazine.

799
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:05,652
Another magazine?

800
00:41:05,668 --> 00:41:07,572
You mean there's two
magazines that want you?

801
00:41:07,588 --> 00:41:09,230
Yeah. Can you believe that?

802
00:41:09,248 --> 00:41:10,980
When did this happen?

803
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:14,353
I'll get it. But, Betty...

804
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:16,413
no news till I get back.

805
00:41:16,788 --> 00:41:20,191
- Dad-- Just tell us something.
- Betty, come on, just tell us.

806
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:21,753
Wait.

807
00:41:31,216 --> 00:41:32,430
Can I help you?

808
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:33,960
Ignacio Suarez?

809
00:41:33,977 --> 00:41:35,240
That's me.

810
00:41:35,258 --> 00:41:37,800
We're with immigration
and customs enforcement.

811
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:39,120
What can I do for you?

812
00:41:39,136 --> 00:41:40,922
You're gonna have to
come with us, sir.

813
00:41:40,938 --> 00:41:42,173
Why?

814
00:41:42,185 --> 00:41:44,063
Mr. Suarez,
you're under arrest.
