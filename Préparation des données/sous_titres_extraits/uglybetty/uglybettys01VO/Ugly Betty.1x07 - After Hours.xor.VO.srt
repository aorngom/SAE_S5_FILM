1
00:00:00,527 --> 00:00:02,311
Previously on Ugly Betty...

2
00:00:02,321 --> 00:00:03,391
I am your mother.

3
00:00:03,401 --> 00:00:05,398
Then maybe you
should act like it.

4
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:08,083
Listen, I'm sorry.
I'm new here,

5
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:10,794
and I'm not really that
familiar with everyone yet.

6
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:12,471
- Of course, I'm--
- Daniel Meade,

7
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:14,169
"Mode" magazine--

8
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:17,772
the only one in this room
who was born into his job.

9
00:00:17,782 --> 00:00:20,839
I never applied for a
green card or amnesty

10
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:25,180
because I was afraid
they'd send me back.

11
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:29,235
I killed Ramiro Vasquez.

12
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:40,539
Why are you dripping
on my bagel?

13
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:43,181
I was on the "M.Y.W." floor,
standing under sprinklers,

14
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:45,040
and there was a fire. Sorry.

15
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:46,523
And you were there because...

16
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:48,323
Oh! I was getting
Sofia's autograph.

17
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:49,580
You like her books?

18
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:50,770
It's terrific.

19
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:53,142
Seems like generic
chick lit to me.

20
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:54,622
No. No, Daniel.

21
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,350
Actually, it's--it's inspired.

22
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:57,523
Really?

23
00:00:57,538 --> 00:00:59,690
"Girls like it on top"?

24
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:03,131
- It's a metaphor.
- Ah... yeah.

25
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:05,980
Anyway, she was signing my copy,
and there was a wastebasket by her

26
00:01:05,996 --> 00:01:08,413
in the copy room, and the sprinklers
went off, and now I'm wet.

27
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:10,890
Betty, you have
mascara on your face.

28
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:12,090
Thanks.

29
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:13,510
Other side.

30
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:16,152
So... I have any messages?

31
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,151
Yes. Mike Day called, and he's turning
down the hotel review assignment.

32
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:21,211
He says he only does
serious journalism now.

33
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:23,901
Unbelievable. Five years ago,
he's writing for an airline magazine.

34
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,932
Now he's acting
like Katie Couric.

35
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:28,140
That's the third writer who's
turned down the assignment, right?

36
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:30,442
I'll put together a list of
other freelancers for you.

37
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:32,371
Everybody get in here.

38
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,511
We can't waste any more time.

39
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:37,012
- What the hell?
- Just keep all their stuff together,

40
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:38,500
- so it won't get mixed up.
- What are you doing?

41
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:42,072
Oh, my editors and I are working
here until our offices are cleaned.

42
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:44,120
No, wait a second.
You can't just come in here

43
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:45,893
and take over my
conference room.

44
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,262
Your daddy said I could.

45
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:49,802
Mr. Meade didn't
okay it with me.

46
00:01:49,817 --> 00:01:51,423
Then you should take
it up with him.

47
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,210
Whoa, whoa! Be careful with those
mock-ups. You're getting 'em all wet.

48
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:56,501
Those have to go back
exactly as they were.

49
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,170
Well, of course, of course.

50
00:01:58,187 --> 00:02:00,891
'Cause you might forget which
half-naked, emaciated woman

51
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:02,392
you want for your cover.

52
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:03,741
And your lead story?

53
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:06,501
Just great--"Ten ways to
lose thighs and get guys."

54
00:02:06,518 --> 00:02:07,630
- So empowering.
- Really?

55
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:10,600
And what's your cover story,
"Ten ways to treat a guy like dirt

56
00:02:10,615 --> 00:02:12,901
so you end up a lonely,
desperate cat lady"?

57
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:16,651
Well, the title's a little long,
but thanks for the story pitch. Bye.

58
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,382
This is outrageous.

59
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,391
Wilhelmina, be reasonable.

60
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:25,382
You're asking me to entertain Ted
Lebeau, the president of Beaumart--

61
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:29,721
a store which has the fashion
equivalent of canned ravioli.

62
00:02:29,737 --> 00:02:31,312
We need their ad dollars.

63
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:33,601
Lebeau is only in town from
Texas for the weekend.

64
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:36,823
I need you to push him off the
fence and into our pockets.

65
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:38,473
Why aren't you assigning
this to Daniel?

66
00:02:38,486 --> 00:02:40,900
We both know you're the
best person for the job.

67
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:43,251
You've landed almost
every account for "Mode."

68
00:02:43,265 --> 00:02:45,670
And yet I'm still just
creative director.

69
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:50,163
Also, I think Ted might be more
receptive to a beautiful woman.

70
00:02:51,115 --> 00:02:54,163
Well, I can't argue with that.

71
00:02:54,678 --> 00:02:57,920
I'll charm the denim
chaps right off him.

72
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:02,762
Hey. You want a sandwich?

73
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:04,532
No, thanks.

74
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:10,423
Last time you were this quiet,

75
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:12,581
you were about to tell
me you were pregnant.

76
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:16,992
I think I know where we can
get the 5 grand for Leah.

77
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:19,371
You tell the lawyer anything
about why I had to emigrate?

78
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:21,791
No, I wouldn't tell
anybody that you...

79
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:23,703
Killed a man?

80
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:25,483
I can't imagine what you
and your sister think of me.

81
00:03:25,517 --> 00:03:28,842
Hey, no.
Papi, you were defending mom.

82
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:30,591
We understand.

83
00:03:30,606 --> 00:03:32,501
We don't judge you.

84
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:36,411
Thank you, mi amor.

85
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,601
So... where you
getting this money?

86
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:42,011
Santos.

87
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:43,652
Absolutely not.

88
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,623
I don't want a cent
from that degenerate.

89
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:47,781
We have no choice!

90
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:57,111
Oh, there you are.

91
00:03:57,477 --> 00:04:00,190
Betty, I've got
something for you.

92
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,265
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:02,651
This one's nice and dry.

93
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:06,501
"To Betty... a girl like no other.
Love, Sofia."

94
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:08,852
Wow, that's so nice. Thank you.

95
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:10,172
You're welcome.

96
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:11,843
Listen, I need a little favor.

97
00:04:11,856 --> 00:04:14,122
Of course. Anything, anything.

98
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:16,701
I want to get fresh eyes
on this piece I'm writing.

99
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,862
Yeah, okay. Um, I'll just call 
the features editor,

100
00:04:18,877 --> 00:04:21,443
- and they can help you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

101
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:24,212
I want your opinion.

102
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:27,302
You're my key
demographic for "M.Y.W."

103
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:29,330
I am hoping to appeal
to the regular girl,

104
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:32,082
not these hipster
fashionistas here.

105
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:35,251
Okay, cool. Um...

106
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:38,701
"sexaholics--spotting them
and stopping them."

107
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:44,042
Um... you know, I'm--
I'm not so sure that I'm qualified

108
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:45,950
to give an opinion
on the subject.

109
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:49,203
Betty Suarez,
you are more than qualified.

110
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:50,863
You understand my writing.

111
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:53,421
I mean, I have read every
single one of your books,

112
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:57,473
and, um, when I was at Queens college,
I wrote a report about you.

113
00:04:57,487 --> 00:04:59,803
- What's going on?
- I'm honored.

114
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:02,761
Oh, I needed some
thoughts on this article,

115
00:05:02,776 --> 00:05:05,730
and I'm taking advantage
of Betty's intelligence,

116
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:08,890
which I'm sure you
underuse on a daily basis.

117
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:11,722
All right. You know what?
I've had enough of you.

118
00:05:11,737 --> 00:05:13,132
First, you take over
the conference room.

119
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:15,360
Now you're trying to
hijack my assistant.

120
00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:17,871
Betty... come on.
I have a lot of things for you to do.

121
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:21,030
Sorry, Daniel. I didn't know 
you were the jealous type.

122
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:22,483
Betty.

123
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:24,033
Sorry.

124
00:05:26,086 --> 00:05:27,760
But maybe I can help you later.

125
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:29,933
I'm sure. Thank you.

126
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:33,283
She wants me.

127
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:34,203
Excuse me?

128
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,611
Well, you were there.
You saw it, right?

129
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:38,113
I didn't really pick up on it.

130
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,072
Oh, come on. Sexaholics?

131
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:42,090
That was clearly a jab at me.

132
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:44,850
She gave you the article
because she knew I'd see it.

133
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:47,800
Daniel, you think maybe you're reading
just a little bit too much into this?

134
00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:48,930
No, no, no, no, no.

135
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:52,203
Trust me. I know women.
She's playing games.

136
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:55,643
But you know what? It's fine.

137
00:05:55,816 --> 00:05:57,773
I'll just play
games right back.

138
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:01,223
Daniel, um, do you actually
have something for me to do?

139
00:06:01,635 --> 00:06:06,050
Uh... yeah. I, uh, I need you 
to pick up my dry cleaning.

140
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:10,231
I need you to buy me a new sliding
plastic thingy for under my chair.

141
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:12,031
That one's worn out.

142
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:15,931
"Slidy plastic thingy."

143
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:18,020
Coming right up.

144
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:23,075
Betty!

145
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:25,589
I'll tell you what. Uh...

146
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:27,651
I do have something
more important for you.

147
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:31,040
Um, you know I need a writer
for that hotel review.

148
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:32,520
Why don't you do it?

149
00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:35,822
What? What,
I can write the review?

150
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:38,491
- Shut up. Really?
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

151
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:40,400
The hotel is 50 Prince in Soho.

152
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:42,823
You can just change the reservation
to your name, if you want.

153
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:45,593
Okay. Yeah. Great.
Um, when do you need it by?

154
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:48,010
Uh, monday.
Leave a little early today

155
00:06:48,027 --> 00:06:49,923
and just spend the whole
weekend at the hotel.

156
00:06:49,936 --> 00:06:52,731
Okay... wait! Um, this weekend?

157
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,333
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

158
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:01,062
Walter planned a romantic
weekend for us in Atlantic City,

159
00:07:01,078 --> 00:07:02,702
and he's really
looking forward to it.

160
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:04,880
Oh, you can go to
Atlantic City anytime.

161
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:06,932
All you need to do is find
the nearest retirement home,

162
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:08,732
get on the first
bus that pulls up.

163
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:10,092
I don't want to disappoint him.

164
00:07:10,107 --> 00:07:12,130
Well, invite Walter to go
to the hotel with you.

165
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:14,173
That way you still get to
spend the weekend together,

166
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,141
but just not surrounded by
seafood buffets and $10 hookers.

167
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:19,153
Yeah, but then he's gonna
distract me from my work.

168
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:20,783
Sounds to me like you've
already made your decision,

169
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,633
but you're feeling
bad about it.

170
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:24,630
Hey, braveheart,
Wilhelmina wants you to put together

171
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:26,660
a rack of Beaumart
clothes for the meeting.

172
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:28,582
Oh, check out the
Kelly Clarkson line.

173
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:31,642
All her skirts have a elastic waist-
bands, so they're really comfortable.

174
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:32,842
Thanks for the tip, love.

175
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:34,141
Of course.

176
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:38,142
So... I hear Daniel gave you
a big writing assignment.

177
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:40,461
Yeah, it's really exciting.
It's my first one.

178
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:42,490
A word of advice--
you may want to take

179
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:44,700
the Betty-wear
down just a notch.

180
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:47,181
The human piñata look may
be all the rage in Queens,

181
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:50,121
but in Soho, they'll arrest you
for crimes against humanity.

182
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,633
Have fun.

183
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,501
What about Atlantic City?

184
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:58,230
This hotel review is
really important.

185
00:07:58,246 --> 00:08:00,953
If--if I do a good job, it could
lead to better things at "Mode."

186
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:03,273
I can't just pass up
this opportunity.

187
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:06,143
Oh, I was really looking
forward to this trip with you.

188
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:09,900
I got us tickets for the live
stage show of "The price is right."

189
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,240
- You did?
- Yes!

190
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:13,723
And you know I rule at plinko.

191
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:17,312
Well...

192
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:20,172
why don't you come and
stay with me at the hotel?

193
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:23,240
I don't wanna stay at some
lame Manhattan hotel.

194
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:27,340
I'm going to A.C.,
and I'm winning a dinette set.

195
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:33,322
That wasn't much
of an invitation.

196
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:35,631
Well, Atlantic City
isn't going anywhere.

197
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:38,602
No, honey,
but your boyfriend might.

200
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:01,051
I got it. I got it.
Don't worry.

201
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:07,863
Thank you.

202
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:16,130
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

203
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:17,762
It's just a hotel,

204
00:09:17,777 --> 00:09:19,823
and I'm here to do my job.

205
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:24,050
Hi.

206
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,890
I have a reservation.

207
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:27,690
Betty Suarez.

208
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:31,232
Whoa. Nice orthodontia.

209
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:32,510
B right.

210
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:35,190
Thank you.
Um, do you need I.D.?

211
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,441
I have a business card
in here somewhere.

212
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:38,711
You're from "Mode"?

213
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:41,153
I am. Yes.
Do you need to see my card?

214
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:44,110
Ms. Suarez,
welcome to 50 Prince.

215
00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:45,803
We're delighted to
have you as our guest.

216
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:47,751
We have a wonderful
suite waiting.

217
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:49,281
Please have a seat,

218
00:09:49,295 --> 00:09:50,770
and the bellhop will
be right with you.

219
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:53,443
Okay. Thank you.

220
00:09:53,978 --> 00:09:56,760
Um, those aren't real.

221
00:09:57,546 --> 00:09:58,943
Right.

222
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:09,593
Thank you.

223
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:29,070
You know that's not
a pop-up book, right?

224
00:10:29,887 --> 00:10:31,323
I hope not.

225
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:33,310
I'm doing research.

226
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:37,880
I'm writing an article on women
who tease their way to the top.

227
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:39,840
Can I get some quotes?

228
00:10:39,957 --> 00:10:42,853
You think I tease
men to get power?

229
00:10:42,868 --> 00:10:44,511
You don't know me at all.

230
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:46,402
Well, give me an hour.

231
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:49,181
Daniel Meade--

232
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:52,470
you are a
presumptuous, chauvinistic,

233
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:55,833
payaso, prepotente, insolente,

234
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:58,571
creído, presumido...

235
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:03,440
Shoot. I don't have
any cash, but...

236
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,831
I have three rides left on it.

237
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:08,223
Thank you.

238
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:10,731
Thank you.

239
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:28,462
I'm in heaven.

240
00:11:28,477 --> 00:11:31,682
I'm in hell.
Imagine working at a sweatshop

241
00:11:31,697 --> 00:11:33,851
and not even being proud
of what you're making.

242
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:35,881
Oh, now look at this.
This isn't too bad,

243
00:11:35,897 --> 00:11:37,413
this little tartan number.

244
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:38,803
Well, then you wear it.

245
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:42,172
I'm sure you'll be a big hit at
the next bagpipe convention.

246
00:11:42,186 --> 00:11:44,192
Oh, now I like this.

247
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:48,000
I think this is perfect for your
weekly meetings at the coven.

248
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,391
Here's what I've dug up on Mr.
Ted Lebeau.

249
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:56,203
Aside from being obscenely wealthy,
he has three kids,

250
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:59,753
four ex-wives and five
golden retrievers.

251
00:11:59,768 --> 00:12:02,553
I think Davy Crockett
showed at Westminster.

252
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:03,782
How nouveau riche.

253
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:07,821
All right. Let's sprinkle a little
lone star state around my office.

254
00:12:07,837 --> 00:12:09,970
Make him feel at home.

255
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,171
Oh, Mark.
Did, uh, Nico return my call?

256
00:12:13,185 --> 00:12:14,420
Not yet.

257
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,521
Are you certain you sent the care
package to the boarding school?

258
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:18,950
I'm certain.

259
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:20,740
Can you call her again, please?

260
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:22,070
Yes.

261
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:26,602
Oh!

262
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:30,280
Soft and cozy.

263
00:12:32,596 --> 00:12:36,273
No... uh, lavish refinement...

264
00:12:36,486 --> 00:12:40,461
and downy opulence.

265
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,721
Spectacular view.

266
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:48,451
No... that's boring.

267
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:51,433
Deliciously divine view.

268
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:57,353
Ms. Suarez. How can I help you?

269
00:12:57,367 --> 00:12:59,122
Oh. Hi.

270
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:01,001
I'd like to order a massage.

271
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:02,413
Very good.

272
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:04,603
You look like a bank manager.

273
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:08,092
I doubt any bank managers are
wearing La Perla undergarments.

274
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:11,251
I found an interview
in a whiskey magazine

275
00:13:11,265 --> 00:13:16,150
where tex extols
the virtues of rye.

276
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:22,440
Yes?

277
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:26,281
Ah, yes. Marc will come and
escort him in. Thank you.

278
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:30,112
Oh! I wanted to
watch him mosey.

279
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:31,510
All right.

280
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:33,441
I'm gonna giddyap.

281
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,001
Ooh. Howdy.

282
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:52,521
Mr. Lebeau.
I'm Wilhelmina Slater.

283
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:53,902
Pleasure to meet you.

284
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,740
Call me Ted.

285
00:13:55,828 --> 00:13:57,410
Ted it is.

286
00:13:57,428 --> 00:13:59,263
That's our most popular line.

287
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:00,810
Affordable and stylish.

288
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:03,251
The career woman on a budget.

289
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:04,380
How you like it?

290
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:06,682
It's like nothing I own.

291
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:09,273
Well, it looks good on you.

292
00:14:14,075 --> 00:14:16,982
So you a fan of college ball?

293
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:18,293
- Excuse me?
- Longhorns.

294
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:20,222
You went to U.T.-Austin?

295
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:22,513
Oh, no. Uh, Marc did.

296
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:27,871
Yes, I did.
It was so... southern.

297
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:32,520
Go Longhorns! Yay!
God bless America.

298
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:34,761
Is this your daughter?

299
00:14:34,777 --> 00:14:37,013
Yes, it is.

300
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:39,903
So shall we talk, uh, business?

301
00:14:39,915 --> 00:14:42,342
Well, my ad people tell me I
should be in your swanky magazine,

302
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:45,263
but I'm not sure
it's the right fit.

303
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:49,743
Why don't you convince me?

304
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:07,373
Oh, my gosh.

305
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:18,020
Hi, I'm Sven.
Ready for your massage?

306
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:19,683
You're not a girl.

307
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:22,262
No, all the women were
booked for the evening.

308
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:25,201
I'll set up the table,
and you can disrobe.

309
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:50,701
These are good, really good.

310
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,290
You can't even feel
the difference.

311
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:53,482
Definitely.

312
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:56,093
You know, I didn't get an
invite to the slumber party.

313
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:58,120
Did I miss the pillow fight?

314
00:15:58,136 --> 00:16:00,321
Can I have the
water bra, please?

315
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:03,933
You know, if you want a man's
perspective-- natural and bigger.

316
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:06,113
Daniel, we're doing an article

317
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:09,613
on breast reconstruction
for recovering women.

318
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:12,722
Oh. Um...

319
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:15,662
um... I'm gonna go.

320
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,042
Are you sure you wanna
wear your glasses?

321
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:24,303
Yeah. Yeah, um,
I have to take notes.

322
00:16:25,286 --> 00:16:27,622
So... um... would you say that

323
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:30,773
you are manipulating
my muscles right now?

324
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:32,131
I guess.

325
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:38,633
Hmm. Um...
is this Shih Tzu or...

326
00:16:38,648 --> 00:16:40,960
or are you "Rolfing" me?

327
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:43,063
I'll get that.

328
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:46,641
You just, uh...
you just keep relaxing.

329
00:16:51,505 --> 00:16:52,860
Yes?

330
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:55,313
What's going on here?

331
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:07,213
Santos.

332
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:10,992
Hilda. I haven't
seen you in a few.

333
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:12,122
You look good.

334
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:15,303
Um... can I talk to you
in private for a second?

335
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:21,171
I heard at junior's bodega
you hit big on a number.

336
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:24,952
Right to the point--
that's my favorite thing about you.

337
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:27,060
I can't say I have a
favorite thing about you.

338
00:17:27,076 --> 00:17:28,611
Please.

339
00:17:28,626 --> 00:17:31,211
I know what I got
that you like.

340
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:34,070
I need money, Santos.

341
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,060
For Ignacio.

342
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:37,543
Come on, in this neighborhood?

343
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,892
You heard I won money.
I heard you need money.

344
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:43,020
- How much?
- 5 grand for a lawyer.

345
00:17:43,036 --> 00:17:46,120
Look, I've never
asked you for a penny,

346
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:49,023
but we're in a lot of
trouble right now.

347
00:17:50,658 --> 00:17:52,352
I need your help.

348
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:58,321
You know how hard
this is for me.

349
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,961
You always carry that
kind of cash on you?

350
00:18:07,978 --> 00:18:10,181
I didn't get a chance to deposit
it in my checking account.

351
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:13,422
I didn't know they had
checking accounts at O.T.B.

352
00:18:14,797 --> 00:18:16,900
Look, I only got
half right now.

353
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:18,802
I'll give you the rest later.

354
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:21,372
But I want to see
Justin in return.

355
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,472
I want to see my son.

356
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:32,082
It's not what it seems.
It's just a massage.

357
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:34,042
I have to review all of
the hotel services.

358
00:18:34,058 --> 00:18:38,033
I don't like strange, tall,
muscle guys touching you.

359
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:40,280
It was nothing.

360
00:18:40,455 --> 00:18:42,180
- Excuse me.
- Thank you, Sven.

361
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:44,480
- You were wonderful.
- You're welcome.

362
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,580
Walter-- why are you here?

363
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:48,492
What happened to Atlantic City?

364
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:53,401
I got off the bus at Secaucus.
I couldn't go. I...

365
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:57,293
I just want to spend
time with you, Betty.

366
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,511
It's all about you and me.

367
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:05,873
It doesn't matter if it's
Atlantic City or a...

368
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:10,131
a really nice hotel room. Wow.

369
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:11,883
It's beautiful, isn't it?

370
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:14,451
This is freakin' sweet!

371
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:16,592
I'm really glad you're here.

372
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:18,621
But you know that I need
to focus on my work.

373
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:19,922
We can have fun,

374
00:19:19,938 --> 00:19:22,820
but this weekend is
all about my review.

375
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:24,220
I'm not gonna get in your way.

376
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:24,832
Okay.

377
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:27,481
I need to get changed.
I made dinner reservations.

378
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:30,511
Okay. I'll watch TV
while you change.

379
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:33,980
Walter, you can't wear a
t-shirt to a 3-star restaurant.

380
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:36,623
Why not? Rock stars 
wear t-shirts to award shows.

381
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:38,070
You're not a rock star.

382
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:40,843
You play the flute in a
Jethro Tull tribute band.

383
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:43,010
We're buying you a dress shirt.

384
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:50,400
You like it?

385
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:52,251
It's my prom dress.

386
00:19:52,268 --> 00:19:53,930
Wow.

387
00:19:54,286 --> 00:19:58,273
Our readership has climbed 10% in
the past year, which is impressive,

388
00:19:58,286 --> 00:20:01,403
considering the internet's negative
effect on the magazine industry.

389
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:03,400
Yeah, but the people that shop
at Beaumart don't read "Mode,"

390
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,492
and the people that read "Mode"
are too uppity to shop at Beaumart.

391
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:07,532
What's the point of
spending money on ads?

392
00:20:07,545 --> 00:20:10,330
Well, we do have regular
people that work here, Ted.

393
00:20:10,348 --> 00:20:12,331
We're not out of touch
with real America.

394
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:15,653
I have an uncle who lives all
the way out in New Jersey.

395
00:20:15,668 --> 00:20:18,963
Times are changing.
Couture designers are branching out.

396
00:20:18,977 --> 00:20:21,490
Luella, Mizrahi,
McCartney are all doing lines

397
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:23,651
for discount-brand stores.

398
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,881
With my help,
I can convince a designer

399
00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:27,843
to do a line for Beaumart.

400
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:29,960
That's interesting.
Why don't we chat about it over dinner?

401
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:33,432
Oh, wonderful.
I made reservations at Babbo.

402
00:20:33,446 --> 00:20:35,152
You know,
I don't come to New York City often,

403
00:20:35,186 --> 00:20:38,273
but when I do,
there's only one place I like to go to.

404
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:45,791
I love this place!

405
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,860
I think we're in Kansas, Toto.

406
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,950
But we're only 15 minutes late.

407
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:56,751
We gave up the table
after 10 minutes.

408
00:20:56,768 --> 00:20:59,040
It's friday night,
and we're completely booked.

409
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:00,750
You're not getting in tonight.

410
00:21:00,765 --> 00:21:03,521
Let's just go upstairs.
We'll order room service.

411
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:05,823
We'll snuggle.
It'll be romantic.

412
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:08,120
No! Walter, I have to eat here.

413
00:21:08,137 --> 00:21:09,852
This is my job. Excuse me.

414
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,661
I'm here reviewing your
hotel for my magazine.

415
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:15,891
I'm from "Mode." "Mode."

416
00:21:21,057 --> 00:21:24,331
My mistake. I have a lovely 
table waiting for you.

417
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:26,221
Please follow me.

418
00:21:35,697 --> 00:21:37,380
Give it back.

419
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:39,733
I don't want to be
indebted to that loser.

420
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:41,662
After everything he's
put you through? No.

421
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:44,061
Papi, drop it. It's done.

422
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:49,301
Santos is not a generous man.

423
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:51,751
What did you have to
do for the money?

424
00:21:51,765 --> 00:21:54,480
He's coming to see
Justin tonight.

425
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:58,840
You're just asking
for trouble, mija.

426
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:13,422
I know that's not the picture 
I chose, because the one I chose,

427
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:17,103
it wasn't focused,
unless I'm going blind--oh!

428
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:22,120
Very, very nice, girls.

429
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,320
Who ordered this?

430
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:26,540
- Hmm?
- Not me.

431
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:40,741
So you obviously made it
to the tenth chapter,

432
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:44,731
where I mention indian
food as an aphrodisiac.

433
00:22:46,247 --> 00:22:48,763
Sorry about what I said before.

434
00:22:48,777 --> 00:22:50,801
The whole breast thing.

435
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:54,010
Apology accepted.
So what do you think?

436
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:55,902
Oh, yeah, no.
I'm getting into it.

437
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:58,850
It's pretty funny. Interesting.

438
00:22:58,866 --> 00:23:01,921
But you really think men are gonna
be obsolete in a thousand years?

439
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:04,753
Oh, absolutely. Maybe sooner.

440
00:23:04,946 --> 00:23:07,571
That doesn't mean I
wouldn't miss you.

441
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:09,492
What else caught your eye?

442
00:23:09,507 --> 00:23:12,561
Well, you're the first one in
your family to graduate college,

443
00:23:12,577 --> 00:23:14,751
you speak five languages,

444
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:18,730
and you still have a bullet
in your hip from a...

445
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:20,892
hunting trip.

446
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:24,620
Oh, my god.

447
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:26,742
How can you eat this?

448
00:23:26,757 --> 00:23:29,251
I'm mexican. This is nothing.

449
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:31,640
Oh, you look like you
could use some air.

450
00:23:31,656 --> 00:23:33,591
Do you ride?

451
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:35,981
Ride what?

452
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:50,560
Red wine reduction.

453
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:53,612
Why would I want
my food reduced?

454
00:23:53,876 --> 00:23:56,443
Maybe it has less calories?

455
00:23:56,456 --> 00:23:58,490
I think we should get
the chef's tasting menu.

456
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:00,241
It's probably his
greatest hits.

457
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:01,542
So tell me--

458
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,320
would you say that the
ambience is romantic

459
00:24:06,338 --> 00:24:10,003
or better suited for
business occasions?

460
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:13,733
I don't know.
It's kind of pretentious.

461
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:15,982
Walter, look.

462
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,622
I've never written
anything like this before,

463
00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:19,742
so I don't know what I'm
supposed to be focusing on,

464
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:21,983
and I'd really
appreciate some help.

465
00:24:21,998 --> 00:24:24,361
I don't know anything
about this stuff.

466
00:24:24,377 --> 00:24:27,831
You know what?
Maybe if we go upstairs, right?

467
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:31,292
Order a couple of burgers,
watch a little cable...

468
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:34,000
I can help you review
the TV reception.

469
00:24:34,388 --> 00:24:35,541
What?

470
00:24:35,897 --> 00:24:38,180
Okay, here we go.

471
00:24:38,447 --> 00:24:41,852
- Do you serve food?
- Of course, sweetie.

472
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:48,483
Anything non-dairy?

473
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:49,933
Ted, let's talk ad pages.

474
00:24:49,945 --> 00:24:52,613
Just a second.
Let me see that menu, cutie.

475
00:24:54,228 --> 00:24:57,253
Okay, we'll have an order of nachos,
extra chili,

476
00:24:57,268 --> 00:24:59,743
and we want some hot wings,
and keep that beer coming, darlin'.

477
00:24:59,777 --> 00:25:01,191
Do you like buffalo
wings, Willy?

478
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:04,512
Oh, they are my favorite snack.
Especially on super bowl sunday.

479
00:25:04,525 --> 00:25:05,783
Marc!

480
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:08,312
You know, I think, it's...

481
00:25:08,328 --> 00:25:10,181
- Marc, you can leave, darling.
- I love you.

482
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:12,383
Oh, come on!

483
00:25:21,016 --> 00:25:22,982
Uh, it's a lucky shot.

484
00:25:22,995 --> 00:25:25,810
No luck. I'm good.

485
00:25:26,328 --> 00:25:28,350
Three out of five.

486
00:25:28,366 --> 00:25:31,832
Do you really want to do that
to yourself? I play to win.

487
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:35,492
So do I. Let's, uh,
make it a little more interesting?

488
00:25:35,507 --> 00:25:37,673
Keep that wallet out.
I'm gonna empty it.

489
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:38,683
Really?

490
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:41,470
Come on. Show me your rack.

491
00:25:45,595 --> 00:25:48,450
Sweet corn foam with
black truffle jelly

492
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:50,390
and duck foie gras air.

493
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:52,092
Compliments of the chef.

494
00:25:52,107 --> 00:25:53,441
Thank you.

495
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:00,083
Which one's foam,
and which one's air?

496
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:01,793
Well, that's obvious. It's...

497
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:04,500
whichever one's
lighter is the air.

498
00:26:06,045 --> 00:26:10,130
Um, I think we're supposed to
dip the bread in the foam.

499
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:12,363
Go ahead. Dip.

500
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:32,403
Would you say that

501
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:35,442
that ravished your
inquisitive palate...

502
00:26:35,457 --> 00:26:38,092
or induced an
orgasmic explosion

503
00:26:38,108 --> 00:26:41,311
of scintillating flavors
on your taste buds?

504
00:26:41,326 --> 00:26:43,993
It's like eating shaving cream.

505
00:26:55,455 --> 00:26:57,530
- Did you call him?
- Four times.

506
00:26:57,547 --> 00:26:59,400
It went straight to voice mail.

507
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,663
Mom, it's okay.
He's not coming.

508
00:27:01,676 --> 00:27:03,723
Just forget about it.

509
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:07,033
He's right.
And it's better this way.

510
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:08,623
You don't need him around.

511
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:11,501
He's a speeding train
coming right at you.

512
00:27:31,627 --> 00:27:33,851
Why do you think I'm a tease?

513
00:27:33,868 --> 00:27:36,263
Why do you think
I'm a sexaholic?

514
00:28:00,935 --> 00:28:02,300
You win.

515
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:04,491
Why did you just
throw the game?

516
00:28:04,538 --> 00:28:07,643
Because your ego was
getting a little bruised.

517
00:28:07,655 --> 00:28:10,602
Sofia, let's end the games.

518
00:28:10,616 --> 00:28:12,472
You never answered my question.

519
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:14,352
Why do you think
I'm a sexaholic?

520
00:28:14,366 --> 00:28:16,330
I never said that.

521
00:28:16,347 --> 00:28:18,623
But you sent that
article over to Betty.

522
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:20,340
It was about me, right?

523
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:22,730
You're so narcissistic.

524
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:26,092
What makes you think
it was not about me?

525
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,170
That's it.

526
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:49,720
I am gonna grab that son of a
bitch by the back of his neck

527
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:52,833
and drag him down
Roosevelt boulevard.

528
00:28:52,846 --> 00:28:55,890
Keep watching.
I might be on the 11:00 news.

529
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:08,670
Jellied terrine of brown crab

530
00:29:08,688 --> 00:29:11,771
with lamb's brains
and courgette.

531
00:29:11,787 --> 00:29:13,351
What's courgette?

532
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:14,921
Zucchini.

533
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:17,842
Why didn't you
just say zucchini?

534
00:29:18,676 --> 00:29:21,182
Because they call it courgette.

535
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:24,021
I'm not eating this.
It's gross.

536
00:29:24,037 --> 00:29:25,222
Walter, please.

537
00:29:25,237 --> 00:29:27,052
I want real food, Betty!

538
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:29,103
Walter, will you please
keep your voice down?

539
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:31,492
Could I just get a
burger and fries?

540
00:29:32,376 --> 00:29:34,763
I'll see what I can do, sir.

541
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:38,300
I can't believe that
you just did that.

542
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,492
What? What's the big deal?
It's a restaurant.

543
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:43,182
They have a stove.
They can make me a cheeseburger.

544
00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:44,861
Oh, I should've
asked for cheese.

545
00:29:44,878 --> 00:29:47,990
You know how important this review
is to me, and you're sabotaging it

546
00:29:48,005 --> 00:29:50,410
because you've never liked
me working at "Mode."

547
00:29:50,428 --> 00:29:52,643
No, what--I'm not
trying to sabotage you.

548
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:54,222
I just don't like this place,

549
00:29:54,236 --> 00:29:58,360
and I-I don't like pretending
to be somebody that I'm not.

550
00:29:58,378 --> 00:30:00,903
What? What,
you're saying that I'm pretending?

551
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:03,490
Yeah, and I don't get it.

552
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:05,501
We don't belong in
places like these.

553
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:08,271
No, Walter,
maybe you don't belong.

554
00:30:10,887 --> 00:30:12,762
You're right. I don't.

555
00:30:13,126 --> 00:30:15,822
I don't know Betty from "Mode."

556
00:30:15,836 --> 00:30:18,222
I like Betty from Queens.

557
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:21,720
You know,
why don't you tell her

558
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:24,670
to give me a call
when she shows up?

559
00:30:30,888 --> 00:30:33,422
Nestled in downtown gotham,

560
00:30:33,435 --> 00:30:37,731
the hotbed of all that is super
chic and scrumptiously posh,

561
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:43,832
50 Prince is an absolutely
delectable dreamland.

562
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,772
Hate that. This isn't me.
It's not who I am.

563
00:31:06,856 --> 00:31:09,730
Hi. It's Betty.

564
00:31:25,335 --> 00:31:27,993
You're too late.
Justin's already asleep,

565
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:31,543
and I have been looking
all over for your ass.

566
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:35,961
So what? Tell me, 
what is the excuse this time?

567
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:59,213
I can offer you an insert
in the june issue.

568
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:01,723
It's our bridal issue.
It is one of our top-selling.

569
00:32:01,735 --> 00:32:02,733
One more round.

570
00:32:02,745 --> 00:32:04,880
Oh, Ted.
Enough with the frat party.

571
00:32:04,897 --> 00:32:07,001
You're not gonna advertise.

572
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,911
Just a minute.

573
00:32:12,906 --> 00:32:14,941
Hey, Nico.

574
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,720
Did you get the, uh,
care package I sent you?

575
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:22,201
Oh, of--of course I knew
you're allergic to perfume.

576
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:24,260
That was for your roommate.

577
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:26,331
You don't have a roommate?

578
00:32:26,877 --> 00:32:28,111
Well...

579
00:32:28,695 --> 00:32:30,991
darling, I'm doing
the best I can.

580
00:32:31,646 --> 00:32:35,423
Well, how-- how am I supposed to know
you're in jelly bean withdrawal?

581
00:32:35,435 --> 00:32:38,710
E-mail me a list.
I'll have Marc go to the--

582
00:32:38,937 --> 00:32:40,410
Nico.

583
00:32:51,735 --> 00:32:56,090
Just... what happened?

584
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:59,013
The money I gave you--
I owed it to my bookie.

585
00:32:59,027 --> 00:33:00,612
I was about to come
over to the house,

586
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:03,651
but a couple of large guys
paid me a little visit.

587
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:05,722
Well, at least they left
you with your teeth.

588
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:07,901
That was very
considerate of them.

589
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:10,500
Yeah, but I still had to
cancel my big photo shoot.

590
00:33:10,518 --> 00:33:12,213
With this face?

591
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:14,790
You could do a public
service announcement

592
00:33:14,807 --> 00:33:17,740
about the dangers of
illegal gambling.

593
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:24,743
I'm sorry you spent all
night looking for me.

594
00:33:25,656 --> 00:33:28,073
I'm sorry about a lot
of other stuff, too.

595
00:33:28,085 --> 00:33:31,930
Okay, don't-- don't start
getting all real and emotional.

596
00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:34,142
It's not sexy.

597
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:42,380
I just-- I didn't want Justin
to see me like this, you know?

598
00:33:42,618 --> 00:33:44,673
Hey, you know...

599
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:47,071
it's just a little
blood, and...

600
00:33:47,656 --> 00:33:49,871
a couple of bruises.

601
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:54,722
You'll be brand new when he
sees you on Thanksgiving.

602
00:33:57,278 --> 00:33:59,401
I'd like you to come.

603
00:34:03,657 --> 00:34:04,953
Watch it.

604
00:34:04,968 --> 00:34:06,941
That's what you get.

605
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:10,331
I have three teenage daughters.

606
00:34:11,135 --> 00:34:13,751
When their hormones kick in,

607
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:16,982
one minute they love you,
the next, they're saying

608
00:34:16,998 --> 00:34:20,223
and doing everything they
can to put the hurt on you.

609
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:22,920
Well, she has every
reason to be angry at me.

610
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,982
I didn't put together
her care package.

611
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,380
I had Marc do it.

612
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,802
She's like cat in a saw?

613
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:31,882
She's all upset?

614
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:36,321
I believe the exact words were,
"I hate you. You suck."

615
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,502
If you'd been a stay-at-home
mom and baked cookies,

616
00:34:39,515 --> 00:34:41,531
she'd still hate you
and think you suck.

617
00:34:41,548 --> 00:34:45,102
The truth of the matter is,
I could've tried to bake some cookies...

618
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,581
at least once.

619
00:34:46,596 --> 00:34:48,212
When my girls were little,

620
00:34:48,227 --> 00:34:50,922
I worked 15 hours a day.

621
00:34:51,517 --> 00:34:54,930
Now I'm trying to
make up for it.

622
00:34:55,087 --> 00:34:57,381
It's what you have to do.

623
00:34:58,665 --> 00:35:01,371
It's what your daughter wants.

624
00:35:03,346 --> 00:35:06,401
You know,
I'm glad I saw this side of you.

625
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:09,160
Wilhelmina Slater's a mom.

626
00:35:09,325 --> 00:35:12,093
Trying to be a mom.

627
00:35:12,105 --> 00:35:15,032
Well, someone who makes the
effort to be a good parent

628
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,821
is the kind of person
I want to work with.

629
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:19,963
You'll advertise with us?

630
00:35:19,976 --> 00:35:22,490
Actually, I made that decision after
your sales pitch back at the office,

631
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:25,680
but I thought I'd have a
little fun at your expense.

632
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:28,411
So now I'd like some real food.

633
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,872
What do you say we
go over to Babbo?

634
00:35:29,887 --> 00:35:33,040
I know Mario. He'll keep 
his kitchen open for me.

635
00:35:33,057 --> 00:35:35,862
Oh, thank you!

636
00:35:53,678 --> 00:35:54,983
What's in the bag?

637
00:35:56,057 --> 00:35:57,561
Your burger.

638
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,881
It's kinda cold, and I ate half of it,
but it's really good.

639
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:03,271
Thanks.

640
00:36:05,478 --> 00:36:07,770
You came all the way back
here to bring me a burger?

641
00:36:07,785 --> 00:36:11,801
No. I came back to apologize.

642
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:15,740
You know, when I said that you didn't
belong, I was talking about me.

643
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,642
I was just so nervous that I
couldn't do things the right way.

644
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:22,770
I don't get it.
Why--why do you put yourself through it?

645
00:36:23,126 --> 00:36:25,261
Because...

646
00:36:25,855 --> 00:36:29,481
it's--it's what I've
always dreamed of doing.

647
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:38,482
I'm scared of losing you.

648
00:36:41,978 --> 00:36:44,280
You're not gonna lose me.

649
00:36:44,565 --> 00:36:46,541
I'm here.

650
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:49,773
I just need you to support me.

651
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:10,323
I used the shampoo
you bought me.

652
00:37:10,336 --> 00:37:11,872
It really gets the frizz out.

653
00:37:11,885 --> 00:37:13,052
Oh, that's great.

654
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:14,662
- I gotta get going.
- Here.

655
00:37:14,877 --> 00:37:16,270
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

656
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:18,370
I think I did a good job.
I'm really proud of it.

657
00:37:18,385 --> 00:37:19,921
That's what counts, mi amor.

658
00:37:19,977 --> 00:37:21,902
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

659
00:37:21,915 --> 00:37:23,931
Justin, I need to talk
to you for a second.

660
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:25,122
Okay.

661
00:37:25,707 --> 00:37:27,612
I better get ready for work.

662
00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:31,812
I have a big surprise for you.

663
00:37:31,828 --> 00:37:33,601
Guess who's coming to
Thanksgiving dinner?

664
00:37:33,615 --> 00:37:36,050
Martha Stewart?
I won the contest!

665
00:37:36,068 --> 00:37:38,913
Martha Stewart? No.

666
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:40,933
Your father.

667
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,420
I'll believe that
when I see it.

668
00:37:44,355 --> 00:37:49,950
Look... papito, I know your
father messes up sometimes...

669
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:53,442
all the time,
but he means well,

670
00:37:53,457 --> 00:37:55,083
and he loves you.

671
00:37:55,095 --> 00:37:56,851
It's just something came
up the other night.

672
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,223
I've heard that excuse.

673
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:02,283
Look, your dad came through with
the money to help your grandpa,

674
00:38:02,298 --> 00:38:05,221
so we have to open
our home to him.

675
00:38:05,588 --> 00:38:08,223
I guess. It's just...

676
00:38:09,386 --> 00:38:12,231
Martha would have been
a better surprise.

677
00:38:23,738 --> 00:38:25,083
Good morning.

678
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:27,410
Our offices are
all cleaned up, so

679
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:29,060
we'll be getting
out of your way.

680
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:30,632
Out of my way? Sofia,

681
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:33,312
I haven't stopped thinking
about you all weekend.

682
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:36,832
Sent you a message--messages.

683
00:38:36,846 --> 00:38:38,390
You get my e-mails?

684
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:40,353
Yeah, I was busy.

685
00:38:40,366 --> 00:38:42,442
Busy doing what?

686
00:38:43,128 --> 00:38:45,110
I had plans...

687
00:38:45,565 --> 00:38:47,530
with my boyfriend.

688
00:38:50,797 --> 00:38:52,673
Apologies galore
for friday night.

689
00:38:52,685 --> 00:38:54,803
There's something about
drinking out of body parts

690
00:38:54,817 --> 00:38:57,111
that makes me feel
kind of pukey.

691
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,230
I assume you landed
the account.

692
00:38:59,245 --> 00:39:00,722
Among other things.

693
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:02,211
You must have had some weekend.

694
00:39:02,227 --> 00:39:05,233
A straight man bought
you shoes--nice ones.

695
00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:07,713
I peeked...
and maybe tried them on.

696
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:14,210
"A little high fashion and
a little down-home country

697
00:39:14,225 --> 00:39:16,253
make a great match.

698
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:18,532
Love, Ted."

699
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:50,720
Wow, it's really good.

700
00:39:50,737 --> 00:39:52,573
You did great.

701
00:39:52,588 --> 00:39:54,862
I don't think I
can use it, though.

702
00:39:54,878 --> 00:39:56,682
But you just said
it was really good.

703
00:39:56,696 --> 00:39:59,612
No, it is.
I mean, it's--it's...

704
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:01,733
really you, Betty.

705
00:40:01,747 --> 00:40:05,053
It's just... not really "Mode."

706
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:06,753
Right.

707
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:09,062
Okay, yeah.

708
00:40:09,077 --> 00:40:10,721
I guess I understand that.

709
00:40:10,735 --> 00:40:14,633
See, our readers--they're not interested
in a regular girl point of view.

710
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:19,171
They want something sleek and,
uh, and glamorous.

711
00:40:19,185 --> 00:40:20,660
I will print a shorter
version, though--

712
00:40:20,695 --> 00:40:24,533
the name of the hotel, the, uh,
the 3-star rating you gave it.

713
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:26,202
Okay.

714
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,462
Well, thank you for
the opportunity,

715
00:40:28,476 --> 00:40:31,351
and I hope that if another
assignment comes up,

716
00:40:31,368 --> 00:40:32,931
you'll let me try again.

717
00:40:32,946 --> 00:40:34,872
Absolutely.

718
00:40:35,228 --> 00:40:36,792
Okay.

719
00:40:50,155 --> 00:40:52,551
Oh, there you are.

720
00:40:52,568 --> 00:40:54,813
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

721
00:40:54,825 --> 00:40:56,490
Why are you hiding
in the bathroom?

722
00:40:56,505 --> 00:40:57,801
I'm not hiding.

723
00:40:57,816 --> 00:40:59,653
I'm just...

724
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:02,390
I'm hiding.

725
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:04,502
Is it because of this?

726
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:08,770
I blew it.
He's not gonna run it.

727
00:41:09,245 --> 00:41:10,843
Betty...

728
00:41:11,955 --> 00:41:14,190
what do you care
what he thinks?

729
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:17,050
You cannot let other people's
opinions get you down,

730
00:41:17,066 --> 00:41:19,351
especially in this business.

731
00:41:19,365 --> 00:41:23,000
Now enough of the pity party.

732
00:41:23,116 --> 00:41:25,242
Come on. Stand up straight.

733
00:41:25,256 --> 00:41:27,203
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

734
00:41:27,217 --> 00:41:28,930
Chin up.

735
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:31,150
Show me those braces.

736
00:41:34,727 --> 00:41:36,952
Now repeat after me.

737
00:41:36,966 --> 00:41:39,491
- I am an attractive...
- I am an attractive...

738
00:41:39,505 --> 00:41:41,471
- intelligent...
- intelligent...

739
00:41:41,488 --> 00:41:43,321
confident businesswoman.

740
00:41:43,336 --> 00:41:45,920
- You did read my book.
- I did.

741
00:41:46,195 --> 00:41:48,970
I thought your
article was terrific.

742
00:41:48,985 --> 00:41:50,181
You liked it?

743
00:41:50,196 --> 00:41:52,470
I loved it.

744
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,611
Oh, I almost forgot.

745
00:41:56,627 --> 00:41:59,342
I'm running your article
in my magazine...

746
00:42:00,565 --> 00:42:02,811
if it's all right with you.

747
00:42:05,316 --> 00:42:06,640
Yes!
