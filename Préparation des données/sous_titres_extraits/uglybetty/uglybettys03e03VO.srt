But That's Marc's Job.

7
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:12,504
And Now It's Yours.

8
00:00:12,723 --> 00:00:14,697
Stuart,
What Are You Doing Here?

9
00:00:14,906 --> 00:00:16,620
What's Wrong?
I Think He's Doing Drugs Again.

10
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:18,660
What?
I Was On That Trip With You
In Paris.

11
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,922
I Remember You Drooling
All Over His Mother.
Your Son's Grandparents
In France

12
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:25,243
Filed A Claim For Custody.
I Want To Stay With My Father.

13
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:27,933
I've Made A Decision.
Tonight We Are Welcoming Back,

14
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:31,270
As Editor-In-Chief Of "Mode,"
Daniel Meade.

15
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,633
Don't Forget, I Still Own
A Third Of This Company.

16
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:36,175
 <I>You</I> Would Be Nothing
Without That Baby.

17
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:37,378
You Can't Push Me Aside.

18
00:00:49,804 --> 00:00:52,800
Um, Is That Light
Really Necessary?

19
00:00:56,337 --> 00:00:57,837
Sorry, Miss Suarez.

20
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:59,488
That's Okay. Believe Me.

21
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:01,237
No One Wants To Know
What Happened To Christina

22
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:03,270
More Than I Do.
About That--

23
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:05,175
Do You Have Any Idea
Where Mr. Meade Was Last Night?

24
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:09,977
Um... Do I Know
Where <I>Daniel</I> Was Last Night?

26
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:23,425
Hi, Dad.
Morning, Sweetheart.

27
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:26,170
Are We Gonna Do This
Every Morning?

28
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:28,337
Hey, I Miss You At Breakfast,
But I'm Sure

29
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,800
You're Having A Great Breakfast
In Your Own Apartment.
(Mouth Full) Mmm. It's Great.

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,050
I Can't Help It.

31
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,612
I Still Worry About You,
By Yourself In The Big City.

32
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:38,645
You Think You Have Enough Locks
On Your Door?
(Normal Voice) I Have Plenty.

33
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:40,678
And I Grew Up In The Big City,
Remember?

34
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:43,627
There's No Need To Be
So Protective Of--My Umbrella.

35
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:45,765
Why Would I Be Protective
Of Your Umbrella?

36
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:47,694
No, I Left My Umbrella
Outside My Apartment,

37
00:01:47,915 --> 00:01:49,315
And Now It's Gone.

38
00:01:49,348 --> 00:01:51,081
 <I>Amor,</I> You're Too Trusting.

39
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:53,148
You Leave Your Umbrella
Outside Your Apartment,

40
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:56,112
People Will Steal It.
I'm Sure Somebody
Just Borrowed It.

41
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:59,682
My Neighbors Are Really Nice.
It Sounds A Lot Like
Your Bike In The Seventh Grade.

42
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:02,582
Okay, Those Guys Totally Said
That They Would Bring It Back,

43
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:04,519
And It's Fine If Someone
Borrowed My Umbrella,

44
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,548
'Cause I Don't Need It Today
Anyway.

45
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:11,114
You Look Different.
I'm Wet.

46
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:13,114
 <I>Big</I> Improvement.
Betty.

47
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:15,114
Good Morning, Daniels.

48
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:16,615
What Is Popping, Shorty?

49
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:19,682
Super Tight.
I Am Outtie Five, 'Kay?

50
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:22,348
(Chuckles) Everyone At School
Listens To Hip-Hop,

51
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:24,482
So He's Sort Of
Been Studying Up.

52
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:26,425
Oh, Well,
He Is A Fast Learner.
Uh-Huh.

53
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:29,415
All Right, Daniel,
Your First Day Back At "Mode"--

54
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:30,504
Schedule...
Thank You.

55
00:02:30,504 --> 00:02:32,981
Mail.
Oh, That's It?

56
00:02:33,014 --> 00:02:34,504
Yep, The Rest Of It
Got Forwarded To Alexis,

57
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:36,613
But I'm On It. Don't Worry.
Oh, And I Also Thought

58
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:38,925
That I Would Go Do
A Dry Cleaning Run For You

59
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,925
Since You're Off
The Tracksuits. Yay!
Great. Oh. Uh, Can You Have

60
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:46,014
My Raincoat Dry-Cleaned
While You're At It?

61
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:49,048
(Coughs) Hello, Dusty.

62
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,425
Oh, And I Was Supposed
To Get My Mom Home Last Night,

63
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:54,175
But I Ended Up Leaving The Party
Early, So If Anyone Asks,

64
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,738
You Can Just Say,
Uh, We Were, Uh,

65
00:02:56,738 --> 00:03:00,175
Here Late Packing Up
At "Player" Magazine.
But We Weren't At "Player."

66
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:03,441
Oh, I Know. I Just Thought
It Was The Simplest Explanation.

67
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:04,988
Well, Why Don't You Just Say
Where You Really Were?

68
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:06,988
Wouldn't That Be Simpler?
Because I Would...

69
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:10,422
Because It's Not A Big Deal.
(Claps Hands)

70
00:03:11,863 --> 00:03:14,333
People! I Have
An Announcement To Make!

71
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:17,058
This Is Urgent!
I Have Important News!

72
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:20,207
Wilhelmina Slater
Is In The Hospital.

73
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,508
(Gasps)
It's Okay. She's Only There
Because Last Night

74
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,508
Her Surrogate, Christina,

75
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,908
Fell Down The Stairs
And Is Unconscious.

76
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,174
(Gasps) What?

77
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:30,971
Don't Worry.

78
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,941
The Baby And Wilhelmina
Are Fine.

79
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:35,908
Marc! What About Christina?

80
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:39,316
I'm Sure That She's--
You Know What? I Didn't Ask.

81
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:55,425
(Whispers) Christina...

82
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,908
(Normal Voice)
Hi. It's Betty.

83
00:03:57,942 --> 00:03:59,441
Hey, Betty.

84
00:03:59,474 --> 00:04:02,597
Are You All Right?
What Happened?

85
00:04:04,174 --> 00:04:05,942
I Don't Remember.

86
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:09,107
It's--It's A Bit Fuzzy.

87
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:11,174
I Was Leaving The Party.

88
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:13,042
I'd Had An Awful Time.

89
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:18,042
And... I Was
At The Top Of The Stairs,

90
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:21,708
And...

91
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:24,141
And--And Then
Someone Pushed Me.

92
00:04:24,174 --> 00:04:26,008
What?

93
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:29,488
<I>(Large Cat Growls)</I>
Mama...???

94
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:31,363
Rumors Are Swirling
Ever Since The Surrogate...

95
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:32,362
 <I>(Woman Screams)</I>
Carrying Wilhelmina Slater

96
00:04:32,362 --> 00:04:34,504
And Bradford Meade's
Latent Love Child

97
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:37,641
Fell Down The Stairs.
Or Was She <I>Pushed?</I>

98
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:39,488
With Meade In The Balance,

99
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,394
Everyone Wants To Know Who
Could Have Done Such A Thing--

100
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:45,461
The Millionaire Playboy,
The Tranny C.E.O.,

101
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,113
The Angry Matriarch
Acquitted Of Murder

102
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:51,127
Or Any One Or Wilhelmina's
Many Close Frenemies?

103
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:53,261
La Slater Lost No Time

104
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,628
In Trying To Help Authorities
Find The Culprit.

105
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:58,661
I Will Not Rest Until The Person
Who Threatened The Life

106
00:04:58,695 --> 00:05:01,494
Of My Unborn Child...
(Whispers) And Others.

107
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:05,503
And Others
Is Brought To Justice.

108
00:05:05,503 --> 00:05:08,661
So I'm Offering
A Reward Of $100,000

109
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:10,494
To Anyone With Information

110
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:15,827
Leading To The Apprehension
Of This Monster.

111
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,860
This Is A Huge Opportunity.

112
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:20,706
The More
They Talk About This,

113
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:22,362
The Less They Talk
About The Poor Sales

114
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:24,441
Of My First Issue Of "Mode."
(Turns Of Tv)

115
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:27,191
Still, Willie,Doesn't It Worry You A Little,
This Whole Situation?

116
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:29,362
Well,
Of Course I'm Worried, Marc,

117
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,270
But When Someone
Gives You Chintz,

118
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:32,794
You Can Do Two Things--

119
00:05:32,828 --> 00:05:35,761
"A," Whine About The Fact
That It's An Upholstery Fabric

120
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:39,862
Or "B," Turn It Into
A Fabulous Bolero Jacket.

121
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:42,238
Okay, You're
A Diabolical Fashion Genius,

122
00:05:42,238 --> 00:05:44,425
And I'm Delighted To Be
Your First Assistant Again,

123
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:46,295
But Your Baby...

124
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:50,362
And Others
Are In The Hospital.

125
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:52,238
I-I-I-I Know They're Okay,
But...

126
00:05:52,238 --> 00:05:53,595
Marc, You're Right.

127
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:57,488
At The End Of The Day,
It's About My Child.

128
00:05:57,488 --> 00:05:59,300
Now We'll Have To Make Sure
The Press Knows That.

129
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,941
We Need Speeches, Vigils,

130
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:03,675
Long Nights At The Hospital
With Our Scottish Rent-A-Womb.

131
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:05,238
We'll Have To Make Sure

132
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:09,488
They Don't Forget
The Real Victim Here.
The Baby.

133
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,237
Me.

134
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,206
You.

135
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:16,425
(Headset Beeps)
Hello. "Mode" Magazine.

136
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:17,816
You'll Have To Call Back.
(Beep)

137
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:20,487
Detective Averaimo. I'm Here
To Question People About--
I Did It.

138
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:23,208
Excuse Me?
And Now You Have To
Interrogate Me For,

139
00:06:23,242 --> 00:06:25,675
Like, Hours And Hours,

140
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:28,408
And I Do Not Break Easy.

141
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:31,863
(Lowered Voice)
I Am Totally Easy.

142
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:34,425
Detective Averaimo,
Betty Suarez.

143
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:35,815
We're Gonna Set You Up
In The Conference Room.

144
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:38,175
(Normal Voice) Oh, But I'm
Guilty. Where Are You Going?

145
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,612
Just So You Know,
The Victim,

146
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:42,208
Christina Mckinney,
Is My Best Friend.

147
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:42,999
Don't Worry, Miss Suarez,

148
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:45,774
We're Taking This Case
Very Seriously.

149
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:47,863
The Attempted Murder Of A Woman
And Her Unborn Child...

150
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:50,503
Well, If There's Anything Else
That I Can Do For You,

151
00:06:50,503 --> 00:06:51,737
Please Just Let Me Know.

152
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:54,362
Yeah, Well, You Can Start
By Answering A Few Questions.

153
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:02,975
Um, Is That Light
Really Necessary?

154
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:05,874
Sorry, Miss Suarez.

155
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:08,375
Do I Know...

156
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:10,975
Where Daniel Was
Last Night? Um...

157
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:13,808
You Know, After The Party.

158
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:15,941
I'm Not Really Sure.

159
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:21,642
You See, He Sort Of Asked Me
To Say He Was Working Late.

160
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,500
If Anyone, You Know, Asked.

161
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:27,572
He Asked You To Lie?

162
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:31,427
Uh... No, No. Uh, Not A Lie.

163
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,781
More Of A Small Untruth.

164
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:36,941
(Cell Phone Ringing)
Excuse Me.

165
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:39,941
No.

166
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,201
I Think I Just Found
A Very Promising Lead.

167
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:49,671
He Said "Very Promising Lead,"

168
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,541
And Then He Circled
 <I>And</I> Underlined Daniel's Name.

169
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:55,120
It's All My Fault.
Speaking Of Which,

170
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:57,242
I've Been Watching
A Lot Of Cop Shows Lately,

171
00:07:57,271 --> 00:08:00,329
And That Mariska Hargitay
Wears Some Amazing Pantsuits.

172
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:03,358
I'm Just Trying
To Keep Things Upbeat.

173
00:08:03,387 --> 00:08:04,126
Sweetheart,

174
00:08:04,155 --> 00:08:06,880
I'm Sure If He Circled
And Underlined Daniel's Name,

175
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:09,248
The Detective Had
A Pretty Good Reason.

176
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:10,988
Dad, He Only Thinks
Daniel's Guilty

177
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:12,196
Because Of Something I Said.

178
00:08:12,196 --> 00:08:14,799
It's Not Like Daniel Could Ever
Do Something Like That.

179
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,814
Well, If Daniel's Innocent,

180
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:18,341
Then He Has Nothing
To Worry About, Right?
Right.

181
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:22,878
You're Right.
I'm Worrying About Nothing.

182
00:08:23,443 --> 00:08:26,602
I Better Get Going. Trains Take
Forever To Come After 9:00.

183
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,063
Okay.

184
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,449
Thank You
For The Italian Burgers.

185
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:31,347
All Right. Bye.
You're Welcome.
Let Us Know What Happens.

186
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:35,159
Okay.
(Lowered Voice)
Hi. Sorry I Missed Supper.

187
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:39,521
I'm Sure You Were Busy.
Hey. Listen. We Need To Talk
About Me And Coach, Okay?

188
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,730
You're The Only One Who Knows,

189
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:46,063
And I Know
You're Still Mad At Me.
Hilda, I'm Not Mad.
I Was Just Surprised Yesterday.

190
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,745
I Never Thought
You Were The Type Of Person

191
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:51,696
Who'd Do Something Like This.
Wait, Wait, Wait, Wait.
Wait A Minute.

192
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:55,706
I'm The Same Person. I'm Your
Sister. Have A Little Faith.

193
00:08:55,706 --> 00:08:58,635
Tony's Marriage Isn't Working,
Okay? He Wants To Be With Me.

194
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:00,929
But Getting Out
Of A Situation Like That

195
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:02,394
Is A Little Bit Complicated,

196
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:04,597
So That's Why
We Were Wondering

197
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:08,061
If Maybe We Could
Just <I>Borrow</I> Your Apartment.

198
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:09,729
What? Are You Crazy?

199
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:11,563
No, Hilda.
I'm Not Gonna Let You

200
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:14,270
Turn My Apartment
Into Some Sort Of Sex Den.

201
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:17,430
Shh. It's Not About Sex.
It's About Love.

202
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:19,110
Fine.
Then Some Sort Of Love Den.

203
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:21,907
If It Was Just About That,
Then We Could Do It In His Car.

204
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:23,348
But That Is No Place

205
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:25,827
To Talk About Whether Or Not
We Have A Future Together.

206
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:29,160
Betty, I'm Trying To Figure This
Thing Out With Him, You Know?

207
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:34,058
And All We Need Is A Place
To Talk. Just Talk. I Promise.

208
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:44,847
I Love You.
Thank You, <I>Mami.</I>

209
00:09:57,337 --> 00:09:59,062
Well, Before You Talk
To Daniel,

210
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:00,729
Could You
At Least Handcuff Me?

211
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,675
Daniel,
I Have To Tell You Something.

212
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:09,894
I Meant To Tell You Yesterday,
But I Thought

213
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:11,242
I Should Do It In Person.
You See, I Sort Of Might Have

214
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:13,024
Maybe Admitted To The Police
That You Asked Me To Lie

215
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:15,474
About Where You Were
The Night Of The Party.
Wait. Why Would You Do That?

216
00:10:15,503 --> 00:10:18,436
I Don't Know!
I Am Not A Very Good Liar,

217
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:20,726
And I Didn't Think It Was That
Big Of A Deal, And Then He--

218
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:22,161
Mr. Meade,
You Got A Minute?

219
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:24,654
I Was Wondering About Something
I Noticed In Your Office.

220
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,471
Are These Your Sneakers?
Yeah. Uh, Those Are Actually--
They're Bapes.

221
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:31,428
They're... (Clears Throat)
One-Of-A-Kind.

222
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:33,949
Nigo Hand-Molded The Soles
For Me And Everything.

223
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:37,210
Fancy. Size 11, Huh?
Mm-Hmm.

224
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:39,152
I'm Afraid
You're Under Arrest.
What?

225
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:39,690
Wait. What?

226
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:43,608
The Tread Marks Here
Match The Size 11 Shoe Printswe Found In The Stairwell

227
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:45,300
Where Miss Mckinney Was Pushed. 

228
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,158
Betty, Call My Lawyer.

229
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:52,086
*(Grunts)Um, Right. Okay, I Will.

That Almost Seems Cheap.

234

(Alexis) Here Comes The Press.
Come On, Guys.

235
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:19,935
Has Anyone
Talked To Daniel Jr.?

236
00:11:20,315 --> 00:11:22,753
I Don't Want Him
To See His Father Like This.

237
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:25,681
I've Already Handled It.
I Told Him It's A Meade Thing.

238
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:27,681
See, Grandma Was
In Jail Before,

239
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:31,613
And Aunt Alexis
May Be In Jail Next.
Seriously, Mom.
We Have To Come Up With A Plan.

240
00:11:31,613 --> 00:11:32,815
I Think Somebody's Framing
Daniel,

241
00:11:32,848 --> 00:11:34,800
And I Wouldn't
Put It Past Wilhelmina.
(Betty) Let's Go.

242
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,175
(Claire) Thank You, Betty.
(Alexis) We Have Nothing
To Say At This Time. Thank You.

243
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:38,737
(Claire) Thank You.

244
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:55,999
What The...

245
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:57,612
(Camera Shutters Clicking)
Oh.

246
00:11:57,612 --> 00:11:59,416
(Woman) Wilhelmina!
Surrogate!
(Man) Right Over Here.

247
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:02,115
(Woman) Surrogate,
Pull The Bandage Down.

248
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:06,893
You're Horrible.

249
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:11,550
Why, Because I Care About
The Welfare Of My Unborn Child?

250
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:13,378
(Loudly) That's Right.

251
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:16,581
I Care About The Welfare
Of My Poor, Unborn Child.

252
00:12:16,615 --> 00:12:18,315
(Man) Good. One More Shot.

253
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:19,878
Because You Are
Using Me And The Baby

254
00:12:19,878 --> 00:12:23,915
As Some Kind Of Prop
For A P.R. Stunt.

255
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:26,049
Ugh. This Pregnancy Has
Just Made You Hysterical.

256
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:27,707
Oh.
Believe Me. I Understand.

257
00:12:27,707 --> 00:12:29,238
It's... (Whispers) Hormones.

258
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:32,408
(Normal Voice) You Just Need
A Drink Of Water. Nurse?

259
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:36,675
Nurse, My--My Surrogate
Needs Some Water.

260
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:39,675
She's--She's Suffered
So Much Already.

261
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,191
Please. Won't Anyone Help Me?

262
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:45,167
 <U>Can Someone Just Give Her</U>
Some Water?

263
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:46,800
All Right!
(Gasps)

264
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:02,401
Daniel, Look.

265
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:05,175
I Know This Is My Fault,

266
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:07,334
And I Really Want
To Help You Get Out Of It,

267
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:11,301
But You Did Tell Me To Lie
About Where You Were Last Night.

268
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:13,253
I Know. It's Complicated.

269
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:15,113
More Complicated
Than Attempted Murder?

270
00:13:15,113 --> 00:13:16,816
Look, You Just Gotta
Believe Me, Betty.

271
00:13:16,816 --> 00:13:19,668
You Know Me.
I Didn't Push Christina.

272
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:22,234
But Beyond That,
The Less I Say, The Better.

273
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:38,067
I Promised Betty
We'd Keep It Clean In Here.

274
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:40,668
Oh, That's Too Bad.
I'm Feeling Dirty.

275
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:43,334
Coach, What Did I Just Say?

276
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:45,800
Mmm. Seriously, I'm Dirty.

277
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,941
Water's Out At Work.

278
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:47,769
Thank You Very Much,

279
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:50,201
New York City
Public School System.

280
00:13:50,737 --> 00:13:52,816
(Sniffs) Yeah,
I Kind Of Need A Shower.

281
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:56,077
Okay, Well,
Now I Miss The Sexy Talk.

282
00:13:58,386 --> 00:14:00,988
Do You Want
To Just Take A Shower Here?
Oh.

283
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:03,556
(Chuckles)
I'll Go Get Some Ice Cream,

284
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:06,406
And Then When I Come Back,
We Can Talk.
Talk?

285
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:09,503
Mm-Hmm. When I Say "Talk,"
I Actually Mean Talk.

286
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:12,640
Oh, Yeah. No. No.
I Know Exactly What You Mean.

287
00:14:12,673 --> 00:14:14,573
(Laughs) Mm. I'll Be Back.

288
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:16,273
All Right.

289
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:38,873
All Clean, Sexy Ma--Aah!

290
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,987
Coach?

291
00:14:41,987 --> 00:14:44,753
 <I>Papi.</I> (Gasps) Tony.
Hilda.

292
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:48,253
 <I>Papi,</I>
What Are You Doing Here?
I-I Was Worried About Betty.
I Came To Install Locks.

293
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:51,925
Oh, What'd You Get,
Schlage Locks?
No, Kwikset.

294
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:54,113
Oh, Yeah, Those Are Good.

295
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:05,999
You're Married?

296
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:09,409
 <I>Papi--Papi,</I>
It's--It's Not What You Think.

297
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:12,987
I Think I Should Go.

298
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:20,613
I Don't Know Why Daniel
Won't Tell Me Where He Was,

299
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:22,675
But I Just Don't Think
That He's Capable

300
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:24,831
Of Doing Something Like This.

301
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:27,613
I Mean, It's My Fault
He's In This Situation.

302
00:15:27,646 --> 00:15:30,813
I Have To Prove That He's
Innocent, And You Can Help Me.

303
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,550
Well, What Can I Do?

304
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,925
I Mean, I've Already
Talked To The Police.

305
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:37,613
I Know, But Maybe There's
Something That You Forgot

306
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:40,425
Or Something That
You Didn't Fully Explain

307
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:43,579
That Could Help Us Find
Who Really Pushed You.

308
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:46,147
I... Never Got Around
To Telling You

309
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,013
What Happened With Stuart.

310
00:15:50,713 --> 00:15:52,513
What Happened With Stuart?

311
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:54,946
I S-Saw Him

312
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,046
On The Day Of The Party,

313
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,628
And... We Fought.

314
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:02,999
 <I>You Used Me. You Just Wanted</I>
 <I>The Money To Buy Drugs.</I>
 <I>Christina--</I>

315
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:05,253
 <I>Just Get Your Hands Off Me!</I>

316
00:16:05,253 --> 00:16:07,425
 <I>I'm This Close</I>
 <I>To Calling Immigration</I>

317
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,999
 <I>And Having You Deported.</I>
 <I>(Chuckles)</I>

318
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,679
Oh, My God. Christina.

319
00:16:12,713 --> 00:16:15,738
Everyone's So Fixated On Who
Wants Revenge On Wilhelmina,

320
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:17,269
Nobody's Talking About
Who Hates <I>You.</I>

321
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:20,488
I'm Sorry.
That Came Out Wrong.

322
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:23,113
What Did The Police Say
About Stuart?

323
00:16:23,113 --> 00:16:25,238
I Haven't Exactly
Told Them About It.
(Gasps)

324
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:30,206
(Sighs) God, Betty.
This Has Just Been So Awful.

325
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:32,675
I Mean, Do You Think
That Stuart Could...

326
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:36,175
Really Have Done This To Me?

327
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:38,479
I Don't Know.

328
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:42,213
But You Can't Keep Something
Like This From The Police.

329
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:44,112
Christina, You Have
To Tell Them The Truth.

330
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:45,691
I Know.

331
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:01,113
??

332
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:09,362
Stuart. Hi.

333
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,972
What Are You Doing Here?

334
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:11,916
Well, I Heard Christina
Was In The Hospital.

335
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,611
I Had To Come
And See That She's Okay.
Yeah, Uh,
It's Just That, Um,

336
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:19,738
They Don't Really Want Anyone
In There Who Might Upset Her.

337
00:17:20,612 --> 00:17:22,987
She Told You
About The Fight, Huh?
Nope.

338
00:17:22,987 --> 00:17:25,800
Maybe. What Size Shoes
Do You Wear?

339
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,300
Why?

340
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,237
No Reason.

341
00:17:28,237 --> 00:17:30,503
Size 14. The Kids At School
Used To Call Me "Big Foot."

342
00:17:30,503 --> 00:17:32,159
It Was Humiliating.
Now Do You Want To Tell Me

343
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,160
Why You Need To Know That?

344
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,238
Well, The Person Who Pushed
Christina Down The Stairs

345
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:38,425
Wore A Size 11.

346
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,940
Do You Think I Did It?

347
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:43,675
It Breaks My Heart

348
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:46,863
That You Think I'm Even Capable
Of Hurting Christina.

349
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:49,250
I Love Her.
Well,
What Do You Expect, Stuart?

350
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:52,382
She Gave Up A Lot For You,
To Save Your Life,

351
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:54,425
And Now
You're Doing Drugs Again?

352
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:56,612
I'm In Pain.

353
00:17:57,582 --> 00:17:59,649
The Treatment
That Christina Paid For--

354
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:02,016
It Didn't Work.

355
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:06,566
There's No Cure,
So I'm Gonna Die, Okay?

356
00:18:08,883 --> 00:18:10,983
I'm Sorry. Uh...

357
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:13,425
I Had No Idea.

358
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,549
Are You Going To Tell Her?

359
00:18:15,582 --> 00:18:16,800
After What
Christina's Done For Me,

360
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,999
To Tell Her
It Was All For Nothing,

361
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,112
How Am I Gonna Do That?

362
00:18:19,112 --> 00:18:23,878
After All She's Done For You,
She Deserves To Know.

363
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:52,999
This Didn't Work In High School.
Why Would It Work Now?

364
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,831
What, Are You Stalking Me?

365
00:18:54,831 --> 00:18:58,643
A Married Man, Hilda? I Thought
You Were Better Than This.

366
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:01,659
Said The Guy Who Had An Affair
With Our Mom.
No, That Was Totally Differe.

367
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:02,815
Oh, Right,
Because You're A Guy,

368
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:06,300
And You Got That Whole Latino
Macho Thing Happening.
Don't Make This About That.
This Is About You.

369
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,925
You'd Never Say
Anything Like This To Betty.
Maybe Because Betty Wouldn't
Do Something Like This.

370
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:23,738
Good Afternoon.
Hi. I'm Betty Suarez.

371
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:24,753
I'm Daniel Meade's Assistant.

372
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:28,675
I Need The Security Tapes
From Two Nights Ago.
You Want
The Security Tapes, Too?

373
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:30,488
Like, I Said,
I Work For Daniel Meade,

374
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:32,675
As In Meade Publications.

375
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:35,453
The Guy They Arrested
For Pushing That Pregnant Lady?
That's The One.

376
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:38,128
That's Crazy.
You Work For A Murderer.

377
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:41,175
Ah. Attempted Murderer,
And He Didn't Do It,

378
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:42,753
And You Work For Him, Too.

379
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:45,753
Wow.
I Work For A Murderer.

380
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:47,720
I Hadn't Considered That.

381
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,831
Right, So If You Give Me
The Tapes,

382
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:53,152
And We Can Prove He's Innocent,

383
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:55,686
Then We Won't
Work For A Murderer.

384
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,112
I Can't Do It.

385
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,503
The Morning After Your Boss
Tried To Kill

386
00:19:58,503 --> 00:20:01,488
That Poor Pregnant Lady,
The Tapes Were Gone.

387
00:20:01,488 --> 00:20:04,628
What? Well, Do You Know
Who Took 'Em?

388
00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:08,237
I'll Tell You
What I Told The Police

389
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:10,613
And That Little Blonde Girl.
Okay.

390
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:12,175
I Have No Idea.

391
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:14,378
Wait.
What Little Blonde Girl?

392
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:16,737
So I Asked About The Tapes.
So What?

393
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:18,844
I Am Not Splitting Wilhelmina's
Reward Money With You.

394
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:20,978
Amanda, I Don't Care
About The Reward.

395
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,488
I Just Need To Help Daniel.

396
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,628
Look, You Know
He's Innocent, Too.

397
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:27,844
I Do.
Look, Don't Judge Me, Okay?

398
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:31,045
Not That You Ever
Really Could In... That.

399
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:33,611
But I Really, Really Need
That Reward Money.

400
00:20:33,644 --> 00:20:35,737
I'm Having A Little Bit
Of A Cash Flow Problem,

401
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:39,544
And I May Or May Not Have
Maxed Out A Few Credit Cards.

402
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:41,778
How Many?
Like... (Mumbles) 15.

403
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:45,544
15?
(Normal Voice) Shh. I Like
Nice Things, Okay? So What?

404
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,644
Anyway, I'm Not Talking
To My Parents Now,

405
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:50,412
So I'm Kind Of On My Own
With This, Not That You'd Care.

406
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:52,078
No, Of Course I Care.

407
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:55,045
Look, Amanda, You Were There
The Night Christina Got Pushed,

408
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:57,738
So Why Don't You Just Tell Me
What You Remember?

409
00:20:57,738 --> 00:21:00,316
Well, It Was Late.

410
00:21:00,316 --> 00:21:03,800
That's When I Usually Trythe Credit Card Company's
Indian Call Centers.

411
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,897
They Are So Much Nicer.

412
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,753
Seriously, I Don't Know Why

413
00:21:06,753 --> 00:21:09,720
You're Making Such A Big Deal
Out Of This, Rahul.

414
00:21:09,753 --> 00:21:12,853
Is It A Crime To Purchase Things
You Can't Pay For? No.

415
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:14,887
Amanda,
Have You Seen The Mustard?

416
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,920
I Need It
For My Big, Fat Sandwich,

417
00:21:16,954 --> 00:21:18,550
Which I'm Always,
Like, Eating Around You

418
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,363
And Making
A Total Mess Of Myself.

419
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,720
Y Know.
You Always Are, Right?
Mm-Hmm.

420
00:21:23,753 --> 00:21:26,620
I Do Not Always Eat Sandwiches,
And I Wasn't Even There.

421
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:29,954
I'm Just Saying, It Really
Does Feel That Way Sometimes.

422
00:21:29,987 --> 00:21:32,453
So Anyway,
I Was Back At My Desk...

423
00:21:32,486 --> 00:21:35,553
Okay, If I Pay My Bill,
Then I Can't Pay My Rent,

424
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:38,553
And If I Can't Pay My Rent, Then
Where Will You Send My Bill?

425
00:21:38,587 --> 00:21:41,316
See? This Is
Actually All For You.
(High-Pitched Scream)

426
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:44,503
(Gasps) Christina?

427
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,920
I Peered Around The Corner,
But It Wasn't A Woman.

428
00:21:47,954 --> 00:21:49,362
 <I>Well, It Was Marc.</I>

429
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:51,962
You Will Rue The Day,
Wilhelmina Slater,

430
00:21:51,995 --> 00:21:54,329
That You Decided To Cross
Marc St. James.

431
00:21:54,362 --> 00:21:57,695
I Know All Of Your Plans,
And I Will Make You Pay!

432
00:21:58,828 --> 00:22:01,628
Actually, I Did Push Christina
The Other Night.

433
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:03,595
(Both) What?
Oh, It's Not What You Think.

434
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:05,050
God, You People
Jump To Conclusions.

435
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,195
And You... You'd Think Someone
With Your Skin Tone

436
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:11,800
Would Be A Little More Sensitive
To Prejudice.
Marc,
Don't Change The Subject.

437
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,795
You Just Said
You Pushed Christina,

438
00:22:13,828 --> 00:22:15,925
And Amanda Said
She Saw You Yelling

439
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:17,675
At Wilhelmina That Night.

440
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:21,162
Oh. That.

441
00:22:21,195 --> 00:22:22,879
Well,
That Really Wasn't Anything.

442
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:25,550
Then Why Are You Hiding It?
I'm Not Hiding It. I Just Don't
Want Anyone To Know About It.

443
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:30,800
Marc, That's The Same Thing.
Fine! Do You Want To Know
What I Was Doing? I'll Show You.

444
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,253
(Gasp) You Killed Wilhelmina,
And You Stuffed Her!

445
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:39,753
But You Put Her In Tahari?
Amanda,
It's A Wilhelmina Doll.

446
00:22:39,787 --> 00:22:41,050
(Marc)
It's A Wilhelmina Mannequin.

447
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,675
She Had It Made
For Dress Fittings.

448
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:45,784
Now I'm Not Proud Of This,
And I Will Deny It If Asked,

449
00:22:45,784 --> 00:22:48,815
But Sometimes
When I'm Angry At Her,

450
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:53,628
I Will Pull Out The Mannequin
Late At Night And... Yell At It.

451
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:56,800
You Will Rue The Day,
Wilhelmina Slater,

452
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,201
That You Decided To Cross
Marc St. James.

453
00:22:59,934 --> 00:23:01,305
I Know All Of Your Plans,

454
00:23:01,706 --> 00:23:04,689
And I Will Make You Pay.

455
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:10,626
You Slapped Her?

456
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:12,644
Hard Core.

457
00:23:12,644 --> 00:23:14,269
Well, I Apologized Afterwards.

458
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,520
I Mean,
I Know She's Not Real,

459
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,113
But She Still Scares Me
A Little.

460
00:23:18,554 --> 00:23:20,784
Marc, You Still Haven't
Explained

461
00:23:20,784 --> 00:23:23,612
Exactly Why You Were Angry
At Wilhelmina.
Oh, I Don't Know.

462
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:25,853
Maybe Because I've Been Loyal
To Her For Years,

463
00:23:25,886 --> 00:23:27,238
And Then In A Matter Of Days,

464
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:30,050
She Hires
This Little Mayan Fireplug

465
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,187
And Promotes Her Above Me?

466
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,800
Marc, That Again?

467
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,238
You May Think
That I Lick Willie's Boots

468
00:23:35,238 --> 00:23:37,737
Because I Like It, And I Do
A Little--They're Fancy--

469
00:23:37,737 --> 00:23:40,237
But There Is A Reason
Why I Put Myself Through It.

470
00:23:40,237 --> 00:23:41,925
You're Not The Only One

471
00:23:41,925 --> 00:23:44,758
Who Wants To Get Ahead
In The Magazine World.

472
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:50,113
I Have Dreams, Too.
Wow. You Never Mentioned That.

473
00:23:50,113 --> 00:23:52,179
Anyway,
I Was A Little Worked Up

474
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:55,612
Yelling At The Wilhel-Mannequin,
So I Just Wanted To Go Home...

475
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:58,213
 <I>But Christina</I>
 <I>Was Blocking My Way.</I>

476
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:00,313
(Elevator Bell Dings)
Excuse Me.

477
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:02,410
(Claire) You.

478
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,999
You're Carrying That Thing...

479
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:06,613
For Her!
Aah!

480
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:12,113
So That's The Last Time
I Saw Christina, With Claire,

481
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,079
Who Seemed
Pretty Pissed Off At Her

482
00:24:14,113 --> 00:24:15,878
Now That I Think About It.

483
00:24:15,878 --> 00:24:18,645
Oh, My God. Claire.

484
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:21,940
She Had A Motive,
An Opportunity--

485
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,800
Not To Mention,
She Totally Murdered My Mom.

486
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,253
Kind Of.

487
00:24:39,526 --> 00:24:40,904
(Betty)
All Right, Mrs. Meade,

488
00:24:40,904 --> 00:24:42,762
If You Could Just Tell Us
What You Remember.

489
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,675
Just So You Know,
If I Had Done It,

490
00:24:44,675 --> 00:24:48,193
I Would Never Let My Son
Take The Blame.
Oh, Something You Learned
In Prison?

491
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:50,738
There's Two Things
They Always Tell You--

492
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:52,926
Do Your Own Time
And Don't Trust The Popo.
Mm.

493
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,253
Okay. Uh, So What Exactly

494
00:24:56,253 --> 00:24:58,426
Were You Doing
The Night Of The Launch Party?

495
00:24:58,459 --> 00:25:00,726
Well, You Probably Remember Us
At The Party,

496
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:03,925
Exchanging
Our Usual Pleasantries.

497
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:05,362
 <I>You Can't Push Me Aside.</I>

498
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:09,237
 <I>Don't You</I> Ever <I>Threaten</I>
 <I>My Children, Wilhelmina.</I>

499
00:25:09,237 --> 00:25:12,999
 <I>You Have No Idea The Lengths</I>
 <I>I Will Go To Protect Them.</I>

500
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:17,693
You're Not Doing
A Very Good Job Of Explaining

501
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:18,999
How You're Innocent.

502
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:22,093
Yes, Well, Wilhelmina Has
A Way Of Getting Me Worked Up,

503
00:25:22,126 --> 00:25:24,425
 <I>And That Night,</I>
 <I>I Found Myself</I>

504
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:26,993
 <I>Needing A Little Something</I>
 <I>To Take The Edge Off.</I>

505
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,492
 <I>All Right, You Slipped Up.</I>

506
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:31,726
You Had A Drink. So What?

507
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:33,222
That's The Thing.

508
00:25:33,222 --> 00:25:35,626
I Can't Have Just One Drink.

509
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:38,492
I Screwed Up, Betty.

510
00:25:38,526 --> 00:25:40,193
Wilhelmina Slater.

511
00:25:40,227 --> 00:25:43,826
More Like Wilhelmina Slut-Er.
Get It?

512
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:49,359
Oh, That's Okay.
I'm So Funny.

513
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:53,026
Oh! God.

514
00:25:57,126 --> 00:25:59,726
Excuse Me.
Oh.

515
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,726
You.

516
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:08,693
You're Carrying That Thing
For Her!

517
00:26:08,726 --> 00:26:10,316
Oh! Hold It--Oh. Ooh.

518
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:15,800
Oh, Mom.
Yeah, Right Here
On The Sofa.

519
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:18,227
Oh, No.
(Groans)

520
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,940
Mother,
Have You Been Drinking?

521
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,238
Maybe.

522
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:22,738
Well, T-The Last One

523
00:26:22,738 --> 00:26:26,550
Sort Of Ended Up
All Over Me, Really.
Thank You, Christina.

524
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,050
Yeah.
Oh. Thank You.

525
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,175
 <I>My Mother Has Struggled</I>
 <I>With This One For A Long Time,</I>

526
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,242
But I Can't Really Blame Her.

527
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:36,738
It's Been A Stressful Week
For All Of Us.

528
00:26:36,738 --> 00:26:40,613
I Was Sort Of Dealing With
My Own Problems That Night.

529
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:42,342
You Mean Wilhelmina?

530
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:43,975
Yeah. Wilhelmina?
Yeah.

531
00:26:47,376 --> 00:26:50,362
Let Me Remind You
Of My Position At This Company

532
00:26:50,362 --> 00:26:52,925
And Then All Of Yours

533
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:56,815
Before I Say,
This Doesn't Go Any Further

534
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,482
Than... This... Room.

535
00:26:59,515 --> 00:27:00,362
(Gulps) Okay.

536
00:27:00,362 --> 00:27:01,331
(Gulps) That's Great.

537
00:27:03,548 --> 00:27:05,116
We Understand.

538
00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:08,113
I Work Very Hard
To Look Poised...

539
00:27:08,615 --> 00:27:14,049
 <I>But Sometimes Things</I>
 <I>Slip Through The Cracks.</I>

540
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:16,682
 <I>(Betty) Oh, My God.</I>
 <I>What Did You Find?</I>

541
00:27:16,715 --> 00:27:18,050
 <I>(Alexis) Facial Hair.</I>

542
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,112
(Amanda, Betty And Marc)
Facial Hair?

543
00:27:19,112 --> 00:27:22,503
I'd Forgotten
To Take My Estrogen.

544
00:27:22,503 --> 00:27:25,922
I Go To Great Lengths
To Maintain The Illusionthat I Was Born A Woman,

545
00:27:25,972 --> 00:27:27,378
But I Wasn't.

546
00:27:31,988 --> 00:27:35,021
 <I>I'll Be Honest. I Didn't Even</I>
 <I>Notice Christina Leaving.</I>

547
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:38,921
 <I>I Guess She Must Have Snuck Out</I>
 <I>While I Was Helping My Mom.</I>

548
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:41,175
The Rest Of The Night Was Spent
Trying To Hail A Taxi

549
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:42,816
And Keep My Mom
From Getting Sick

550
00:27:42,816 --> 00:27:44,613
On My Brand-New Donna Karan.

551
00:27:48,175 --> 00:27:51,644
Wow. I Never Knew
Alexis Went Through That

552
00:27:51,644 --> 00:27:55,277
Or Claire Or You, Amanda,
With Your Credit Cards.

553
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,316
(Mouths Words)
I Mean, You'd Think There Was
An Easy Explanation

554
00:27:57,316 --> 00:27:58,925
For These Things,
But There Just Isn't.

555
00:27:58,925 --> 00:27:59,988
I Know, But After
Talking To Everyone,

556
00:27:59,988 --> 00:28:03,706
It Really Does Seem
Like Daniel Did It.

557
00:28:03,706 --> 00:28:05,339
And I'm Genuinely Surprised.

558
00:28:05,372 --> 00:28:08,439
No, Daniel Is Innocent.
I Know He Is.

559
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:12,539
Maybe Wilhelmina
Could Help Us Prove It.

560
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:14,573
Prove What?
Prove That Daniel's Innocent.

561
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:16,675
(Whispers) Oh, I Didn't
Understand That Part.

562
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,300
Christina Was
Standing Right Here.

563
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,879
Okay, Guys. Go Ahead. Throw
The Mannequin Down The Stairs.

564
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:31,506
Hmm. I Don't Want
To Be Critical Here,

565
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:33,675
But We Can't Reenact
This Crime With That Mannequin.

566
00:28:33,675 --> 00:28:36,550
It's Way Too Skinny.
So True.
We Need Something Heavy

567
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,606
That Can Double
As A Convincing Pregnant Woman.

568
00:28:40,906 --> 00:28:42,472
Guys, Don't Be Ridiculous.

569
00:28:42,506 --> 00:28:44,539
I'm Not Gonna Let You
Throw Me Down The Stairs.

570
00:28:44,573 --> 00:28:46,113
Just Relax. You Won't Break
Anything Unless You Tense Up.

571
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:48,425
Marc, I Said Let Me Go! Aah!

572
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,639
Are You Guys Crazy?

573
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:05,539
You Could Have Killed Us.

574
00:29:09,673 --> 00:29:13,673
 <I>Great. Can You Have My Raincoat</I>
 <I>Dry-Cleaned While You're At It?</I>

575
00:29:13,706 --> 00:29:15,472
 <I>(Coughs) Hello, Dusty.</I>

576
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:16,940
Oh, My God.

577
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:18,425
Daniel's Coat.

578
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:25,345
Dear, I Was Talking
To Barbara Walters' People

579
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:26,655
About Setting Up An Inter--

580
00:29:26,952 --> 00:29:28,487
Well, I--
Everything All Right?

581
00:29:28,487 --> 00:29:31,207
Emotional Stress Is
Not Good For The Baby.

582
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:33,550
(Voice Breaking)
Stuart Came To See Me.

583
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:38,011
His Treatment Didn't Work.

584
00:29:38,044 --> 00:29:40,544
And He's Dying.

585
00:29:42,477 --> 00:29:45,044
Well, I Suppose
That's The Danger

586
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:48,510
Of Experimental Treatments.

587
00:29:49,862 --> 00:29:52,877
Can You Just Leave Me On My Own
For A Little While?

588
00:29:52,911 --> 00:29:54,987
Please.

589
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,832
Oh... What Did I Do?

590
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:33,707
Daniel. Hi. I Was Just
Looking For Some Paperwork.

591
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:34,690
Nope. It's Not Here.

592
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:37,623
Hey, I'm Glad I Found You.
Look, I've Just Been Wanting

593
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:40,757
To Tell You How Much
Your Faith In Me Has Meant

594
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,023
During This Whole Ordeal.

595
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:44,490
Yeah. Of--Of Course.

596
00:30:46,441 --> 00:30:47,112
Something Wrong?

597
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:51,078
No, Nothing's Wrong.
Why Would Anything Be Wrong?

598
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:51,175
I Don't Know,

599
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:53,737
Just Kind Of The Way
You Said, "Nothing's Wrong,"

600
00:30:53,737 --> 00:30:57,550
It Kinda Like, You Know, Sounds
Like There Is Something Wrong.

601
00:30:57,675 --> 00:30:58,999
Nope.

602
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:02,050
Oh, I Gotta Go.

603
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:13,362
Betty?
(Gasps)

604
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:16,629
Thank God You're Here.
I Don't Know What To Do.

605
00:31:16,662 --> 00:31:20,462
Hilda's Having An Affair.
Coach Diaz--He's Married.
I Know.

606
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:22,028
Wait. What? You Know?

607
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:26,695
Dad! Enough With The Spanish.

608
00:31:26,729 --> 00:31:28,613
I Think
Daniel Pushed Christina.

609
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:29,972
What?

610
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:33,325
I Found This In His Bag.

611
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:36,361
It's A Security Tape From "Mode"
The Night Christina Got Pushed.

612
00:31:36,391 --> 00:31:39,363
He Stole It.

613
00:31:39,363 --> 00:31:40,291
Do You Think He's Guilty?

614
00:31:40,325 --> 00:31:43,258
I Don't Know. I Don't--
I Don't Know What To Think.

615
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:45,050
I Mean, I Spent The Entire Day

616
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,300
Trying To Prove
That He's Innocent,

617
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,425
And All I Found Out Was That

618
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:51,025
Everything Is More Complicated
Than I Thought.
Betty, This Is
Why I Worry About You.

619
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,992
I Know, Dad. I Know. You Think
I'm Naive. I'm Too Trusting.

620
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:57,925
Is It Really Naive
To Want To Believe In People?

621
00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:03,878
I Mean, Look At Hilda.
Okay, So She Made A Mistake.

622
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:05,441
She's Still A Good Person.

623
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:08,300
And I Would Say
The Same Thing About Daniel

624
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,129
Right Before I Found This.

625
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:13,487
That's Not Being Naive, <I>Mija.</I>

626
00:32:14,211 --> 00:32:15,677
That's Faith.

627
00:32:19,311 --> 00:32:21,675
Have You Seen It?

628
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,585
No.

629
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,783
I Don't Want To Know
If I'm Wrong About Daniel.

630
00:32:29,923 --> 00:32:32,023
What If You're Right?

631
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:56,613
Ew, Daniel.
This Is Dirty...

632
00:32:56,613 --> 00:32:59,378
And Awkward.

633
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,524
But Why Would He Want
To Hide That From The Police?

634
00:33:06,503 --> 00:33:06,999
It's Complicated.

635
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:10,144
It's Not <I>That</I> Complicated,
Daniel. I've Seen The Tape.

636
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,362
Oh, God. Not The--

637
00:33:11,362 --> 00:33:13,675
Yes, And I Saw It
With My Dad.

638
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:17,721
Okay, So... The Woman
I Was With That Night,

639
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:19,284
That Was Holly,
The State Department Liaison

640
00:33:19,284 --> 00:33:22,737
Who's Been Helping Me
With My Custody Problems?
And You're Sleeping With Her?

641
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:25,844
No, No. That--That Happened
After She Started Helping Me.

642
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:27,300
It Wasn't Like
She Started Helping Me

643
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,675
Because We Slept Together,
But If It Ever Got Out,

644
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,074
I Know That's
What It Would Look Like.

645
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:36,863
That's It? That's Why
You Couldn't Say Anything?

646
00:33:37,175 --> 00:33:39,128
What, Are You Crazy?

647
00:33:39,128 --> 00:33:41,575
Daniel, You Were Arrested
For Attempted Murder!

648
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:43,441
Yeah, Which I Didn't Commit.

649
00:33:43,474 --> 00:33:45,253
Look, I Had To Believe
They Were Gonna Find

650
00:33:45,253 --> 00:33:46,550
The Real Culprit Eventually.

651
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,487
Besides, If They Ever Found Out
Where I Really Was That Night,

652
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:51,690
Holly Could Have Lost Her Job,
I'd Lose Her Help

653
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,550
And I Could Lose Daniel Jr.
Forever.

654
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,738
He's My Son, Betty. I'm Not
Gonna Lose Him Now. I Won't.

655
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:00,774
Oh, My God.

656
00:34:00,807 --> 00:34:04,315
Daniel, I Have Never Been
More Happy

657
00:34:04,315 --> 00:34:06,999
To Find Out About
One Of Your Sleazy Affairs.

658
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:09,566
Oh! I Knew You Couldn't Have
Pushed Christina.

659
00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:12,466
I Believed In You,
And I Was Right. Mm!

660
00:34:12,499 --> 00:34:14,900
Thank You, Betty.

661
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,566
Um, I'm--I'm Sorry
To Do This Right Now.

662
00:34:16,566 --> 00:34:19,566
I-I'm Late To Pick Up D.J.

663
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:23,112
Right. Okay. Yes.
You Should Go.

664
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:28,675
Would You Mind Giving That Coat
Back To Alexis?

665
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:31,487
What Do You Mean,
Give It Back?
She Borrowed It
A Couple Days Ago.

666
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:33,644
It Looks Better On Her Anyway.

667
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,206
Alexis?

668
00:34:48,316 --> 00:34:50,175
I Know You Did It.

669
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:55,629
I Don't Know What
You're Talking About, Betty.

670
00:34:56,564 --> 00:34:58,455
Daniel's Coat.
You Borrowed It.

671
00:34:58,455 --> 00:35:00,934
It Had Dust Fsom The Bottom Of
The Steps Where Christina Fell.

672
00:35:02,581 --> 00:35:04,925
So I Got His Coat Dusty.
So What?

673
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:07,958
It Doesn't Mean Anything.
What About Your Feet?

674
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:10,488
Excuse M
There Are A Lot Of Things
You Can Change About Yourself,

675
00:35:10,488 --> 00:35:11,800
But Your Shoe Size
Isn't One Of Them.

676
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,113
Men's Size 11,
Just Like Daniel's,

677
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:15,862
Same As The Ones
The Police Found

678
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:17,863
At The Bottom Of The Stairs.

679
00:35:17,863 --> 00:35:20,488
You Pushed Christina, Alexis.

680
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,206
What Do You Want?

681
00:35:26,846 --> 00:35:29,547
What You Did To Christina
Was Horrible,

682
00:35:29,581 --> 00:35:33,113
But Then You Stole Daniel's
Shoes And You Wore His Coat?

683
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:35,713
You Framed Your Own Brother,
Alexis.

684
00:35:35,746 --> 00:35:38,238
I-I Didn't Mean For That
To Happen. I Swear.

685
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:40,816
Yeah, Well,
That's What It Looks Like.

686
00:35:46,447 --> 00:35:49,846
The Night Of The Party,
Things Were Bad With Wilhelmina.

687
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,987
I Know We've Had
Our Differences, Wilhelmina,

688
00:35:51,987 --> 00:35:54,441
But We're Going To Have To Find
A Way To Work Together.

689
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:57,644
Oh, Spare Me, Alexis.
You Stabbed Me In The Back.

690
00:35:57,644 --> 00:36:01,550
So Let Me Give You Fair Warning,
My Freakishly Tall Girlfriend,

691
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,738
You Will Never Be Rid Of Me
Thanks To This Baby.

692
00:36:04,738 --> 00:36:07,344
I Know All Your Secrets,
And When I Get My Chance,

693
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:10,511
You'll Never See It Coming.

694
00:36:15,394 --> 00:36:18,487
 <I>(Alexis) I Was So Pissed Off</I>
 <I>That I Broke A Heel.</I>
Oh!

695
00:36:19,237 --> 00:36:21,238
 <I>Brand-New Sergio Rossis, Too.</I>

696
00:36:21,863 --> 00:36:23,675
 <I>I Knew He Was My Size,</I>
 <I>So I Went To See</I>

697
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:27,300
 <I>If Daniel Might Have</I>
 <I>A Pair Of Shoes That Fit Me.</I>

698
00:36:27,988 --> 00:36:29,800
 <I>Then I Saw The Facial Hair.</I>

699
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,613
 <I>And Right After That...</I>

700
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:37,113
 <I>I Know It's Not Right,</I>
 <I>But At That Moment,</I>

701
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:40,238
 <I>I Didn't See Christina.</I>
 <I>I Saw Someone Else.</I>
 <I>(Electricity Crackles)</I>

702
00:36:41,925 --> 00:36:43,487
You'll Never Be Rid Of Me.

703
00:36:43,487 --> 00:36:45,113
 <I>She Was Right.</I>

704
00:36:45,113 --> 00:36:46,999
 <I>As Long As Christina</I>
 <I>Was Carrying Her Baby,</I>

705
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:48,987
 <I>I Would Never Be Rid Of Her.</I>

706
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,878
 <I>My Mother Passed Out.</I>

707
00:36:54,113 --> 00:36:57,050
 <I>So I Followed Christina</I>
 <I>Out Into The Hallway.</I>

708
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,628
 <I>And I Can't Explain It...</I>

709
00:37:10,425 --> 00:37:12,660
 <I>But When I Saw Christina</I>
 <I>Then...</I>

710
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:14,999
 <I>All I Could Think Of</I>
 <I>Was Wilhelmina</I>

711
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,050
 <I>And Everything</I>
 <I>She's Put Our Family Through.</I>

712
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,706
 <I>I Didn't Think. I Just...</I>

713
00:37:41,862 --> 00:37:44,329
 <I>I Ran To Her Afterward.</I>

714
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,675
 <I>I Made Sure</I>
 <I>She Was Still Alive...</I>

715
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:56,295
 <I>And Called 9-1-1.</I>

716
00:37:57,925 --> 00:38:00,566
 <I>I Can't Justify What I Did.</I>

717
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:05,112
And Daniel--I Never,
Ever Wanted That To Happen.

718
00:38:05,112 --> 00:38:06,550
It Was Insane.

719
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:11,238
I Just Kept Telling Myself,
"He's Innocent. It'll Go Away."

720
00:38:11,238 --> 00:38:13,113
Oh, God, Betty.

721
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:16,925
If I Could Take It Back,
I Would,

722
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,425
But I Can't.

723
00:38:21,515 --> 00:38:23,503
What Do I Do?

724
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:28,284
Well...

725
00:38:29,488 --> 00:38:31,769
No One Else Knows Yet.

726
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:37,175
And I Haven't Told Danielbecause I Know
You're A Good Person, Alexis.

727
00:38:37,175 --> 00:38:40,050
But Right Now, You're The Only
Person Who Can Prove That.

728
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,401
(Woman) * You Wanna Bend 

729
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:47,400
* Oh, But If You Do 

730
00:38:48,256 --> 00:38:51,081
* It All Comes Back 

731
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:56,389
* Just Breathe 

732
00:38:56,422 --> 00:39:00,656
* Breathe 

733
00:39:00,689 --> 00:39:02,756
* Just Breathe 

734
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,256
* Breathe 

735
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:14,890
* We Tend To Forget
We're All The Same *

736
00:39:16,756 --> 00:39:25,890
* We All Have Joy,
We All Have Pain *

737
00:39:25,923 --> 00:39:31,189
* Oh, But If We Would Remember 

738
00:39:31,222 --> 00:39:34,456
* Yeah 

739
00:39:34,489 --> 00:39:41,425
* How Beautiful It Would Be 

740
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:47,738
* If We Breathe 

741
00:39:47,738 --> 00:39:51,050
* Breathe 

742
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:56,425
* Believe 

743
00:39:56,425 --> 00:40:00,675
* Believe 

744
00:40:00,675 --> 00:40:06,237
* We Tend To Forget
We're All The Same *

745
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:16,122
* We All Have Joy,We All Have Pain *
???

746
00:40:18,523 --> 00:40:20,175
* Breathe 

747
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:21,628
So Her Lawyers

748
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:24,566
Are Negotiating
The Terms Of Her Surrender.

749
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,352
Betty, You Think You Know
Your Own Sister By Now...

750
00:40:28,863 --> 00:40:29,988
I Know.

751
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:32,925
People Can Surprise You.

752
00:40:32,925 --> 00:40:34,300
Miss Meade...

753
00:40:36,207 --> 00:40:37,940
If You're Ready.

754
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,815
Dear?

755
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:43,394
Mom, There's One More Thing
I Have To Tell You.

756
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,863
Could--Could You Give Us
Another Moment, Please?

757
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:47,800
Thank You.

758
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:49,862
When I Was Clearing Out
My Office,

759
00:40:49,862 --> 00:40:52,987
I Accidentally Opened Up
A Piece Of Daniel's Mail.

760
00:40:52,987 --> 00:40:55,675
Well, Darling, Given What
We're Dealing With Here,

761
00:40:55,675 --> 00:40:57,550
I Think Daniel's Going To
Overlook That One.

762
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,456
No. No, He Won't.

763
00:41:00,238 --> 00:41:02,237
It Was A Paternity Test.

764
00:41:02,237 --> 00:41:04,816
I Don't Understand.

765
00:41:04,816 --> 00:41:06,113
* Breathe 

766
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:09,362
(Lowered Voice) Daniel
Isn't Daniel Jr.'S Father.

767
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,238
I Am.

768
00:41:11,238 --> 00:41:15,613
* Breathe 

769
00:41:35,071 --> 00:41:43,071
