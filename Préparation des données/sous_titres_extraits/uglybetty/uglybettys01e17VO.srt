1
00:00:00,722 --> 00:00:02,377
Previously on Ugly Betty...

2
00:00:02,427 --> 00:00:05,195
Bradford Meade, you're under arrest
for the murder of Fey Sommers.

3
00:00:05,245 --> 00:00:07,481
I know who killed Fey Sommers.

4
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:09,132
It was me.

5
00:00:09,182 --> 00:00:11,010
- Henry.
- Henry.

6
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:12,422
Hi.

7
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:14,708
Betty, this is my
girlfriend Charlie.

8
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:19,710
Ignacio, why can't
all men be like you?

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,876
Ignacio.

10
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:24,430
You are going to fire Daniel

11
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:26,541
and make me
editor-in-chief, right?

12
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,835
- He's my brother, Willie.
- He is the enemy.

13
00:00:29,888 --> 00:00:31,759
I've kind of realized he's not.

14
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:33,063
That's "The Chin"?

15
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:33,972
Yep.

16
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:36,593
A friend at the D.A.'s office told
me the case against your father

17
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:39,000
isn't as strong as they're
leading everyone to believe.

18
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:41,283
Witnesses claim they
saw a blue Aston Martin.

19
00:00:41,337 --> 00:00:42,841
Blue Aston Martin?

20
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:55,350
Okay, Betty. We're all done.

21
00:00:55,407 --> 00:00:57,841
So now these new wires
are a different gauge,

22
00:00:57,897 --> 00:00:59,672
so they might feel a
little strange to you

23
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:02,461
and to anyone
who's kissing you.

24
00:01:02,516 --> 00:01:04,662
Oh, Dr. Farkas,
nobody's kissing me.

25
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:06,511
Oh, come on.
There must be someone special.

26
00:01:06,565 --> 00:01:09,910
Well, there was a guy,
but he has a girlfriend.

27
00:01:09,965 --> 00:01:11,430
So, uh, how's it feel?

28
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:14,442
Well, it was tough at first,
but now I'm happy.

29
00:01:14,497 --> 00:01:15,551
We're all just friends.

30
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,452
No, I meant the braces.

31
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:20,250
Oh, um... duh. Fine.

32
00:01:20,307 --> 00:01:22,210
So you're comfortable
with this?

33
00:01:22,268 --> 00:01:24,440
Yeah, it'll probably hurt
to chew at first, but...

34
00:01:24,496 --> 00:01:26,173
I'll just have a milk
shake for lunch.

35
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:28,752
No, I meant being friends with
the guy and the girlfriend.

36
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:32,661
Oh, um,
the milk shake will help that, too.

37
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:39,352
Oh, that was great.

38
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:44,202
Okay, and now you're
supposed to say something.

39
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:46,700
Oh, yeah. It was good.

40
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:50,951
Sorry. I'm going through my
morning meetings in my head.

41
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:52,810
Wait. You're not
gonna make me spoon?

42
00:01:53,296 --> 00:01:56,002
No, but you are gonna
make me breakfast,

43
00:01:56,058 --> 00:01:57,290
and then I have to get to work.

44
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:00,563
A woman who likes sex three times
a night and doesn't want to cuddle.

45
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:02,563
Where have you
been all my life?

46
00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:05,913
Well, after you stood
me up in college,

47
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:08,192
I closed my heart
off emotionally,

48
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:11,092
threw myself into work,
substituting ambition for passion.

49
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:13,231
It was just a
rhetorical question.

50
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:14,582
I know.

51
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,022
You're never gonna forget that,
are you?

52
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:20,441
I'm not. I might even bring it
up when I talk to your mother.

53
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:23,283
You're talking to my mother?

54
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:26,390
Hopefully today. Her testimony is
important to your father's defense.

55
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:27,562
You can't talk to her.

56
00:02:27,616 --> 00:02:28,620
Why not?

57
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:30,352
She's gone. She...

58
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:32,920
sort of had a relapse after
my father went to jail.

59
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:35,030
She kind of just took off.

60
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:36,591
Could be anywhere.

61
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:40,811
Technically, this
is kidnapping.

62
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:44,772
You're not blindfolded
in a trunk, mother.

63
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:47,301
This is a deluxe suite
in the Grand Regent.

64
00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:49,411
It doesn't even
have a park view.

65
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:52,313
I might as well be tied to a chair,
having my ear sliced off.

66
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:54,543
It's for your own good.
You can't talk to our lawyer,

67
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:56,660
because you tend to drink,
and you say stupid things.

68
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:58,432
You mean confess things.

69
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:01,191
We talked about this.
You're not confessing anything.

70
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:03,742
Can we at least tell
Alexis the truth?

71
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:06,463
That her father is
not a murderer?

72
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:09,211
It doesn't matter.
She hates him.

73
00:03:10,298 --> 00:03:11,683
He's her father.

74
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:14,792
The only reason she came
back was to put him away.

75
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:18,122
Alexis and I are finally getting along,
but she would turn on me in a second

76
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:20,920
if she found out I hired
Grace Chin to defend him.

77
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:22,201
Come on.

78
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:25,700
This is some family.

79
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:34,213
You're not to talk to anybody.
You're not to call anybody.

80
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:37,543
Claire Meade has
disappeared. Okay?

81
00:03:37,656 --> 00:03:40,111
In fact, I gotta change your
name at the front desk.

82
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:41,742
Brandy Shaloo.

83
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:45,490
What, did you just pull
that out of thin air?

84
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:47,062
It's come in handy.

85
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:52,542
Betty!

86
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:55,022
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

87
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:57,101
Um, how was your weekend?

88
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:58,850
Oh, it was so nice.

89
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:02,833
We just stayed in, ordered takeout,
watched a bunch of movies.

90
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:05,930
Yeah, Vin Diesel
can do anything.

91
00:04:05,987 --> 00:04:07,102
Sounds fun.

92
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:11,142
I, um,
got a new shower curtain.

93
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:15,572
Uh, I like your haircut.

94
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:17,971
Oh! First New York haircut!

95
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:21,612
I didn't take off much though,
because Henry likes it long.

96
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:25,331
So, um, I don't know if you're
free tonight, but, uh...

97
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:26,652
Just ask her.

98
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,280
Well, we're throwing a
birthday party for Charlie.

99
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:31,843
Oh. It's your birthday.

100
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:33,712
First New York birthday!

101
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,662
Lots of firsts.

102
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:38,100
Yeah, so I know it's
really last minute,

103
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:40,060
but we'd love it if
you could make it.

104
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:41,901
Uh, I mean, if you're not busy.

105
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:43,473
Oh, you have to come.

106
00:04:43,526 --> 00:04:45,762
So far it's all of his dorky
friends from accounting,

107
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:48,662
and they get drunk
and talk about W-2s.

108
00:04:48,715 --> 00:04:50,940
Well, it is tax season.

109
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:54,293
Please come.
We need our Betty. Huh?

110
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:56,771
Oh, I've got to run, okay? Bye.

111
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:03,873
Listen, you don't have
to come if it's weird.

112
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,053
Weird?

113
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:08,081
No. No. Why would it be weird?

114
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:09,422
It'll be fun.

115
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:12,090
I need tax advice anyway.

116
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,151
Good. I'm glad.

117
00:05:14,957 --> 00:05:16,080
So...

118
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:19,271
Bring those receipts.

119
00:05:26,477 --> 00:05:29,492
Oh, my dear,
your boobs look totally perfect today.

120
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,712
I'm looking for Amanda Tanen.

121
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,831
- Who wants to know?
- Ooh, a package. I'm Amanda!

122
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:36,051
No. No.

123
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:38,760
I'm from Oswald
Lorenzo's studio.

124
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:40,632
He wanted to give this to you.

125
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:42,323
You are his new muse.

126
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,671
Enjoy.

127
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:47,211
Oswald Lorenzo? He's, like,
the "it" designer for all those actors

128
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,063
whose faces you recognize but you
don't really know their names.

129
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:49,902
Yeah. Like what's-her-name?

130
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:52,742
And that guy. Wait.
How you know Oswald Lorenzo?

131
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:56,561
Well, we met at the Jil
Sander party last night.

132
00:05:56,615 --> 00:05:58,573
He was totally worshipping me.

133
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:01,543
I mean, I get it,
because I was the hottest girl there,

134
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:03,803
but then there was this skank who
was totally trying to horn in,

135
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:06,161
and I was as nice
as I could be.

136
00:06:06,215 --> 00:06:08,052
Out of the way, skank!

137
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,103
Anyway, she was a cow.

138
00:06:12,156 --> 00:06:14,322
She's one of those women
who just hates other women.

139
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:16,590
Enough with the "vagina
monologue." Open it.

140
00:06:22,477 --> 00:06:24,162
What the hell is that?

141
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,330
"To my muse.

142
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:31,982
Enjoy 'the Amanda.'

143
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:33,760
Love, Oswald."

144
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:39,771
He named a dress "the Amanda."

145
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,525
How sweet.
He made you a big silver rubber.

146
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:45,789
Jealous it's not in your size?

147
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,013
A little.

148
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:49,752
Now try this--

149
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:52,711
viennese chocolate dream.

150
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,443
It's european.

151
00:06:57,948 --> 00:07:00,270
Mmm. Fancy.

152
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:03,921
That's what I like
about you, nacho.

153
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:06,422
You enjoy the finer things.

154
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:10,020
You know what all these
international flavors remind me of?

155
00:07:10,318 --> 00:07:12,583
We haven't talked about
my green card in a while.

156
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:13,673
We got time.

157
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:15,590
Your court date's
not for weeks.

158
00:07:15,646 --> 00:07:18,982
Now will this be my
preliminary hearing or--

159
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:24,512
Why does this hazelnut symphony
always make me want to dance?

160
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,400
- Come on, nacho.
- Constance.

161
00:07:26,457 --> 00:07:28,083
Mama wants to shake it.

162
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:30,242
Please, there's no music.

163
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:32,831
Oh, there's music on
these lips, baby.

164
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:36,972
No, I-I can't.

165
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:38,601
There--there's kids
in the house,

166
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,692
and--and I have a
heart condition.

167
00:07:40,747 --> 00:07:43,073
See? Medicine.

168
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:47,571
Louis de Testa has designed a
new line of lingerie for women.

169
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:50,993
Rumor has it that they are wooing
the notorious panty shunners--

170
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:53,390
- Lohan, Spears...
- Hi, there.

171
00:07:54,427 --> 00:07:56,053
A little peace offering.

172
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,530
Hmm. An Hermès scarf. Pretty.

173
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:04,733
I'm sure my cleaning
lady will love it.

174
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:09,352
- Willie, I--
- I'm sorry. Did we have an appointment?

175
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:13,212
I know I'm just creative director,
but I still have a very full plate.

176
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:16,192
Look, I wasn't counting on any of this,
but Daniel...

177
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:19,930
he turned his back on
our father for me.

178
00:08:19,985 --> 00:08:22,651
I have to at least
give him a chance.

179
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:24,530
I understand.

180
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:30,473
Oh. I never noticed what
big man-hands you have.

181
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,511
...Bradford Meade's relationship
with his former lawyer.

182
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:40,492
Taking over the case is size
2 legal eagle Grace Chin.

183
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:43,041
Bradford Meade is a
pillar of society.

184
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:46,172
- He's a loving father and husband...
- What the hell?

185
00:08:46,228 --> 00:08:47,883
...and does not have so much
a parking ticket on his record.

186
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:50,240
Oh, you didn't know?
That's your father's new lawyer.

187
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:52,590
Lucky man.
She's never lost a case.

188
00:08:52,717 --> 00:08:56,492
I guess things aren't working
out as either of us planned.

189
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:08,943
Tasty. Looks like you showed
her who the alpha diva was.

190
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:11,060
Well, I'm glad she's giving
her brother a chance,

191
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:14,293
'cause I assure you...
he's going to disappoint her.

192
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:16,611
We'll make sure of it.

193
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:19,143
Lady, you give me chills.

194
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:21,643
Excuse me.

195
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:25,213
Orthodontist?

196
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:27,990
He's always a little
too generous.

197
00:09:28,046 --> 00:09:29,562
I don't even know
what this is for.

198
00:09:29,615 --> 00:09:31,511
Somebody has a
crush on you, huh?

199
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:35,063
What the hell is that?

200
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:45,610
It's an Oswald Lorenzo.

201
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,512
"The Amanda."

202
00:09:54,347 --> 00:09:57,573
Oh, I almost forgot. Grace Chin's office
called last night after you left.

203
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:59,221
She needs to talk to you.
Says it's important.

204
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:00,962
Yeah, I already saw her.

205
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:01,903
When?

206
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:03,452
Uh, this morning?

207
00:10:03,507 --> 00:10:04,852
Didn't you have a
breakfast meeting?

208
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:05,971
Yeah, before that.

209
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,553
- Weren't you at the gym?
- That's right. After that.

210
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:10,113
- But the breakfast meeting--
- Betty, enough!

211
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:11,763
What's with the
third degree, hmm?

212
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:15,130
I'm sorry. I just get very
involved in your schedule.

213
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:17,352
Oops. You got a hair.

214
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:20,713
Oh, I was standing next to Michelle
from photo in the elevator.

215
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:22,042
Hasn't she been on
maternity leave?

216
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,471
Okay! Okay! I'm sleeping with
Grace Chin. Are you happy?

217
00:10:25,696 --> 00:10:26,700
What?

218
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:30,053
You can't let anyone know,
especially Alexis.

219
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:31,363
I won't.

220
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:35,163
But, Daniel,
do you really think this is a good idea?

221
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,911
No, it's a terrible idea.

222
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:38,840
I mean,
I didn't mean for it to happen,

223
00:10:38,895 --> 00:10:41,341
but it did, and... it was fun,

224
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:44,781
and I'll cool it off
before the trial starts.

225
00:10:44,837 --> 00:10:48,580
Now you're giving me that "I'm so
disappointed in you" look again.

226
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:50,782
I'm sorry. It just happens.

227
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:53,122
Look, I like her, okay?

228
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:57,701
Hey, we just got the new Catherine
Malandrino collection in, right?

229
00:10:57,735 --> 00:10:59,822
Have Christina pick something out.
She'll like that.

230
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,353
This is like the third piece
he's sent to that lawyer.

231
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,042
Serious pain in my ass.

232
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:05,781
I mean,
I'd understand it if they were shagging.

233
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:06,761
They're not.

234
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:08,251
- They are.
- They're not!

235
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:09,912
- They are!
- I just said they're not!

236
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:11,841
You're saying it like they are!

237
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:13,961
Ooh, they are.

238
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:16,600
I am such a terrible liar.

239
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:19,533
Look, Christina, you have to promise me.
You can't tell anybody.

240
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:21,082
Of course I won't.

241
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:24,220
But you can see how a missing
dress could be quite the scandal,

242
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:27,620
what with all the murders and sex
changes going on in that family.

243
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:28,801
Oh, there you are.

244
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:30,220
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

245
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:32,530
I thought you might need a map,
uh, to Charlie's party.

246
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:34,723
It's in the West Village,
so it can be a little hard to find.

247
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:36,430
Great. Thanks.

248
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:37,591
Sure.

249
00:11:37,658 --> 00:11:39,333
Well, I'll see you later.

250
00:11:39,387 --> 00:11:40,492
Okay.

251
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:43,993
- Oh, hi, Christina.
- Yeah, I'm here.

252
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:45,430
Been here the whole time.

253
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:53,283
What?

254
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:55,522
Okay, look,
I know what you're thinking,

255
00:11:55,577 --> 00:11:56,920
but they're my friends.

256
00:11:56,975 --> 00:12:00,132
You're going to his
girlfriend's birthday party?

257
00:12:00,188 --> 00:12:01,853
Betty, he broke your heart.

258
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:04,023
- No, he didn't.
- Oh, really?

259
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:05,271
Fine.

260
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:08,672
This one here was "why doesn't
he love me, Christina?"

261
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,231
And this one here is "she took
him away from me, Christina."

262
00:12:11,286 --> 00:12:13,723
And this one was "make
her go away, Christina."

263
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:15,832
No, this one is gum.

264
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:19,131
Betty, why would you
do this to yourself?

265
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:20,571
Because...

266
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:23,623
I don't want to lose
Henry as a friend.

267
00:12:23,897 --> 00:12:26,483
I'm an adult.
I can rise above this.

268
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:29,170
Fair enough, but just don't go alone.
Get a date.

269
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:30,532
Who? It's tonight.

270
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,633
Well, I don't know.
Well, there must be someone.

271
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,391
Well, this is a surprise.

272
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:38,770
I think I need to come back in
this afternoon, Dr. Farkas.

273
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:40,073
My wire snapped.

274
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,010
Oh, okay. Great.
I'll see you in an hour.

275
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:44,910
Do it. Fast.

279
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:05,431
Okay, first of all,
I don't think we should be following

280
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:09,130
a postpartum depression piece with
a layout on baby doll dresses.

281
00:13:09,187 --> 00:13:10,791
We have a big problem!

282
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:14,522
Okay, crazy time
begins at 1:00.

283
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,003
We're in the middle
of a meeting now.

284
00:13:16,037 --> 00:13:17,591
It's about our father.

285
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:20,610
Excuse me.

286
00:13:21,086 --> 00:13:24,093
Grace Chin is representing him.
She's never lost a case.

287
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:26,471
Okay, uh, well, is that so bad?

288
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:28,993
Do you really want him to spend
the rest of his life in prison?

289
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:30,603
He's a murderer.

290
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,143
What's going on with you?

291
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:36,280
- Did you know about this?
- No, of course not.

292
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:38,621
I don't even know this
Grace Chin woman.

293
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:42,133
Alexis, he is still our father.

294
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:44,853
Before you buy him a set of golf clubs,
let me remind you

295
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,481
that he's the one that made you
feel worthless your whole life,

296
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:49,671
drove our mother to
drink hand sanitizer

297
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:52,541
and told me he'd rather see me dead
than standing here in a dress.

298
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:54,303
The man is a monster.

299
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:00,650
Juicy.

300
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:05,092
That is one angry she-male.

301
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:07,220
What? What did I miss?

302
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:11,640
I would have told you.

303
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:17,533
So you snapped your
wire eating a bagel?

304
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:18,181
Yep.

305
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,263
Was the knife still in it?

306
00:14:21,575 --> 00:14:23,701
You're funny, Dr. Farkas,

307
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:25,262
and you have really
good breath.

308
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:26,791
Uh, it's part of
the job requirement.

309
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:28,940
That, and trimmed nose hair.

310
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:31,541
Oh, yeah.
Yep, that's good, too.

311
00:14:32,108 --> 00:14:34,490
Okay, we're all done here,
so now can I trust you

312
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:36,061
to be a little more
careful this time?

313
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:40,133
I'll try, but, um,
you might have to have dinner with me

314
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:43,113
to make sure I don't eat
anything too dangerous.

315
00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:45,181
Maybe I will.

316
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:49,390
Ah, there is a lot of
dangerous food out there...

317
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:52,333
like--like apples.

318
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:55,051
And carrots.

319
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,300
And corn on the cob.
Are you asking me out?

320
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:02,472
No, not if you don't want to,
but I don't know, maybe you do, I--

321
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,410
I do. Yeah, I'd love to.

322
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:07,011
Sure.

323
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:10,132
None of this is gonna work.

324
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:11,773
We can't use the Dior.

325
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,531
Uh, Sharon Stone wore
it to the Globes.

326
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:16,451
Oh, please. She's over 40.
Like anyone was even looking.

327
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,641
But isn't she aging well?
There is nothing more admirable

328
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:21,672
than a handsome woman.

329
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,803
Stop stressing, Marc.
You'll lose even more hair.

330
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,901
Uh, where is the
Catherine Malandrino?

331
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:33,652
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

332
00:15:34,597 --> 00:15:36,472
That's not like you.
You know where everything is.

333
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:37,670
Yep.

334
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:40,512
I think maybe it
was signed out.

335
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:43,902
Well, the only one who can sign anything
out pre-shoot is the creative director

336
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:45,412
or the editor-in-chief.

337
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:48,473
- Did sign it out, Marc?
- No, you did not.

338
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,632
Oh, I think it might
have been Daniel.

339
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:53,760
Daniel? Really?

340
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:55,251
Why?

341
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:57,061
I've got no idea.

342
00:15:58,096 --> 00:16:01,293
Well, maybe I should call
your little friend Betty.

343
00:16:01,348 --> 00:16:04,132
I'm sure she'd love to hear how
you helped deliver the evidence

344
00:16:04,186 --> 00:16:06,122
to put her boss'
father in prison.

345
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:07,933
You can't keep doing
this to me, Wilhelmina!

346
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:09,561
You're right. I can't.

347
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:12,210
Hello, Betty. It's Wilhelmina.

348
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:13,442
Okay. Okay.

349
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:15,030
Good hair today.

350
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:20,970
Daniel gave it to
Grace Chin as a gift.

351
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:23,072
He said he doesn't
even know her.

352
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:25,560
Why would Daniel be
giving her clothing?

353
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:27,693
I could understand if...

354
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:32,750
He's sleeping with
his father's lawyer.

355
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,811
Oh, that Daniel does
not disappoint.

356
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:43,401
Papi?

357
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:45,641
Are you in here?

358
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:47,261
Grandpa?

359
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:49,960
Shh. Are you alone?

360
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:52,090
What is going on?

361
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,350
I have been calling
you for two hours?

362
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:56,610
I unplugged the phone.
Constance keeps calling.

363
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,210
She won't leave me alone.

364
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,132
I like her. She gave me a dollar
the other day to call her "grandma."

365
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:01,863
Justin.

366
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:05,271
Okay, papi, you are hiding in
your house from your caseworker.

367
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:07,182
- This is nuts.
- No, what's nuts

368
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,731
is my caseworker
is stalking me.

369
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:12,440
This morning, she danced with me,
and then she tried to kiss me.

370
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:13,933
You mean, you and grandma?

371
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:16,720
What? I wanted the dollar.

372
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:22,443
Okay, this is crossing
over into a scary place.

373
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:24,461
- You gotta report her.
- I'm not reporting anybody.

374
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:26,403
I'm just gonna keep her
happy till my court date.

375
00:17:26,437 --> 00:17:29,992
I'm just saying, don't put out the
bait unless you want the fish to eat,

376
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:33,471
- and that's a lot of fish.
- What can I do?

377
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:35,860
I'm not in a position
to say anything.

378
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:39,061
Yoo-hoo, nacho!

379
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:40,870
Papi, let me talk to her.

380
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:46,192
I called Grace Chin's office.
Her assistant says

381
00:17:46,228 --> 00:17:48,372
she's picking up a witness
at the Grand Regent.

382
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:49,512
Wait. What?

383
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,543
The Grand Regent?
No, no, no. Call 'em back.

384
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:52,933
Find out where they're going.

385
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,231
What's the big deal?

386
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:56,252
She's gonna talk
to Brandy Shaloo.

387
00:17:58,558 --> 00:17:59,362
Who?

388
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:03,610
So he's been lying to Alexis about
helping Bradford this whole time.

389
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:07,043
Boinking the lawyer is
just icing on the cake.

390
00:18:07,098 --> 00:18:09,630
- Yummy!
- Oh, too gay.

391
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:12,373
Now I want you to follow
Daniel everywhere he goes.

392
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:15,753
If you can get me proof of the affair,
I can pit Alexis against him.

393
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:17,962
Perfect. They'll be so busy
taking each other down,

394
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:20,123
they won't even notice
you taking over.

395
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:22,761
Oh, fly my pretty, fly!

396
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:24,703
And you thought
"yummy" was too gay?

397
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:36,433
So how long was your husband having
the affair with Fey Sommers?

398
00:18:36,488 --> 00:18:40,403
Let's see. When was that M.C.
Hammer guy hitting the scene?

399
00:18:40,455 --> 00:18:42,113
I had those pants.

400
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:44,460
Oh, crap.

401
00:18:44,518 --> 00:18:46,681
Well, isn't this a coincidence?
Hi, mom.

402
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:48,940
Welcome back from wherever
it is you've been.

403
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:50,670
Grace, how did
you ever find her?

404
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:52,750
I called her home,
and her housekeeper told me

405
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:54,540
she was at the Grand Regent.

406
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:58,170
I may have told Magdalena
about Brandy Shaloo,

407
00:18:58,226 --> 00:19:01,161
but Grace said that my testimony
will really help your father.

408
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:03,940
Good. Good.
Uh, mind if I sit in?

409
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:06,693
Daniel, I really need to
get through these questions.

410
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:08,430
Oh, they got pumpkin soup.

411
00:19:08,485 --> 00:19:11,871
As I was saying, Mrs. Meade,
if I put you on the witness stand,

412
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:15,391
I'm gonna have to ask you about
your feelings towards Fey Sommers.

413
00:19:15,448 --> 00:19:18,220
She was a conniving,
manipulative bitch who deserved--

414
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:21,371
A little forgiveness and
understanding, right?

415
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:25,010
Oh, why does it
say "M.C. Hammer"?

416
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:28,843
Excuse me.
I'm gonna have to take this.

417
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:35,201
Do not yell at me.

418
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,880
You know,
you've become a yeller.

419
00:19:36,935 --> 00:19:38,921
Fine, I won't yell,
but you need to get out of here.

420
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:40,481
I told you to stay
away from this woman.

421
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:43,420
I won't incriminate myself.
Please, you have to trust my judgment.

422
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,663
Really, mom?
'Cause I gotta tell you,

423
00:19:44,695 --> 00:19:47,192
your judgment has been
pretty terrific so far.

424
00:19:47,245 --> 00:19:50,070
If it weren't for what you did,
none of us would be in this situation.

425
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:51,240
I'm just trying to help.

426
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:53,281
Well, don't. Go back to the hotel.
Lock the door.

427
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:54,803
Don't answer for anybody.

428
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:57,271
If you really want to help dad,
just stay out of the way.

429
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:59,910
I mean, how much more damage
do you want to do to us?

430
00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:15,033
- What?
- I know you.

431
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:17,681
You're the slut from
the Jil Sander party.

432
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:19,631
Oswald Lorenzo?

433
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:23,621
Oh, right. You were the one
who was all up in his pooch.

434
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:26,930
Listen, if you
weren't so desperate,

435
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:29,340
he might have made
"the Amanda" for you,

436
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:32,152
but he would have called
it "the skank-whore."

437
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:48,603
Hey, Betty. Glad you made it.

438
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:50,691
Henry. Charlie.

439
00:20:50,745 --> 00:20:53,151
Um, this is my friend,
Dr. Farkas.

440
00:20:53,206 --> 00:20:55,371
Uh, you can call me Gabe.

441
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:57,410
- Uh, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

442
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:59,253
And, uh,
this is for the birthday girl.

443
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:05,360
- A tongue scraper.
- Oh. That's what that is.

444
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:07,761
So many people forget
about the tongue.

445
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:10,413
Well, now I won't.

446
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:14,761
Oh, is that the chocolate
raspberry cake from Magnolia?

447
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,251
Charlie's not much
of a cake person,

448
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,022
so she just told me
to pick my favorite.

449
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,943
Oh, my god. That's my favorite.

450
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:23,711
How about I get us some drinks?
What do you like?

451
00:21:23,747 --> 00:21:25,503
Um, something fizzy.

452
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:28,991
So you didn't say you
were bringing someone.

453
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:30,903
Oh, I-I thought
that would be okay.

454
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,271
Oh, yeah.
Oh, and he's cute, Betty.

455
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:36,093
- And a dentist.
- Orthodontist.

456
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:37,522
Oh, thumbs up.

457
00:21:37,577 --> 00:21:40,013
So how long have you two
been seeing each other?

458
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:42,032
I mean,
just 'cause you haven't said anything.

459
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:45,362
Really? Oh, um, well,
we've known each other for a while,

460
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,020
and, uh, well,
he's a really terrific guy.

461
00:21:48,077 --> 00:21:50,213
Oh, you two are
perfect together.

462
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:53,432
And the chemistry
is just... obvious.

463
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:55,492
- Right, Henry?
- I don't know.

464
00:21:56,008 --> 00:21:57,891
Well, I just met the guy.

465
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:03,463
Well, well, I'm all about vibes,
and I am definitely feeling this one.

466
00:22:03,515 --> 00:22:06,863
You guys should give me your star signs.
I'll totally do your chart.

467
00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:09,363
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

468
00:22:13,557 --> 00:22:15,403
You sure I'm gonna
look like Beyoncé?

469
00:22:15,455 --> 00:22:16,882
Honey, when I am
through with you,

470
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:19,230
Jay-Z is gonna be
ringing your alarm.

471
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:21,261
I don't need to hear from him.

472
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:24,040
I've only got eyes
for one man right now.

473
00:22:24,097 --> 00:22:26,910
I'm so glad you offered
to do this, sugar.

474
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:29,413
I need some insight.

475
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:33,310
Does your daddy like it up,
down, or all around?

476
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:36,030
We are still talking
about hair, right?

477
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,602
Ooh, it's just been such a
long time since I met a man

478
00:22:41,658 --> 00:22:43,821
who made me tingle. Ow!

479
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:46,332
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm still new at this.

480
00:22:46,395 --> 00:22:48,863
But I'm not surprised you'd
say that about my dad.

481
00:22:48,965 --> 00:22:51,321
He does have a way
with the ladies.

482
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:54,301
Ladies? Don't tell me
I've got competition.

483
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:56,091
Well, you didn't hear it from me,
but, uh,

484
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:59,010
there is a certain somebody that
he's been seeing for a little while.

485
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:01,693
What? Why didn't
he tell me this?

486
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:05,341
'Cause he's a decent guy, and he
doesn't want to hurt anybody's feelings,

487
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:09,851
especially not someone who
has done so much for him.

488
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,380
Well, he didn't need
to keep that from me.

489
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,841
So--so you're okay?

490
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:18,023
Hey, if he doesn't want
me his loss, right?

491
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:19,153
Right.

492
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,150
You know what?
The hell with Beyoncé.

493
00:23:21,205 --> 00:23:24,041
- Do me like Mariah.
- All right.

494
00:23:26,246 --> 00:23:28,973
- Okay. Bye.
- Hey, um, I got some bad news.

495
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:31,612
- My mom had to run.
- Wait. No, I've gotta talk to her.

496
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:33,060
No, no, it's okay.
She said she'd call you tomorrow.

497
00:23:33,097 --> 00:23:36,223
- No, let me just tell her--
- No, no, no. No, uh, you can't.

498
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:38,231
- Why not?
- Because...

499
00:23:39,116 --> 00:23:41,510
- I really want you.
- What?

500
00:23:41,566 --> 00:23:46,431
Grace, you look
really hot in that...

501
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:48,513
brown wool suit.

502
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:49,581
Daniel.

503
00:23:49,635 --> 00:23:51,790
Grace, when are you gonna
learn to live in the moment?

504
00:23:51,826 --> 00:23:54,423
- You're insane.
- Am I? Come on.

505
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,550
- You know you want to.
- We're in public.

506
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:58,283
It's kinda hot, right?

507
00:23:58,407 --> 00:24:00,281
All right.
You've got six minutes.

508
00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:14,561
Come on, Daniel. Come on.

509
00:24:16,057 --> 00:24:19,533
So we would've had the party at our house,
but we're still redoing the apartment.

510
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:21,341
Well, we're not redoing it.

511
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:23,030
We just bought a new couch.

512
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,360
It's purple.

513
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:25,610
Purple?

514
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:26,920
You like purple?

515
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:28,780
Well, it's a moon color.

516
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:30,300
It's empowering.

517
00:24:30,355 --> 00:24:32,531
Well, but buying a
couch is the first step.

518
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:34,481
You know what's next,
don't you?

519
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:36,983
What? A coffee table?

520
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:40,980
No, I was gonna say a mortgage.

521
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:42,932
Oh, right.

522
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:45,762
It's just a couch.

523
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:50,322
Oh. Oh, I love this.

524
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:53,300
Henry. Henry,
come dance with me.

525
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,002
Uh, okay.

526
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:03,163
Uh, Betty?

527
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:04,352
What?

528
00:25:04,608 --> 00:25:07,250
Oh. Yes. Of course.

529
00:25:22,815 --> 00:25:25,050
Look, I don't know what I've done,
but you're vibrating.

530
00:25:25,076 --> 00:25:27,102
Oh! Sorry.

531
00:25:28,716 --> 00:25:31,480
- Hello?
- Betty, it's Claire Meade.

532
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:33,761
Am I interrupting something?

533
00:25:33,818 --> 00:25:35,930
Um, I'm at a friend's birthday.

534
00:25:35,985 --> 00:25:37,061
Good. Then you're free.

535
00:25:37,115 --> 00:25:39,763
I need you to bring me
a corporate credit card.

536
00:25:39,816 --> 00:25:41,063
It's an emergency.

537
00:25:41,117 --> 00:25:42,783
I'm at the Grand Regent.

538
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:46,973
Is everything okay?
Is there anything I can do?

539
00:25:47,026 --> 00:25:49,151
How do you feel about
going to the Grand Regent?

540
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:51,230
Am I that good of
a slow dancer?

541
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:53,592
No, no.
That's not what I meant.

542
00:25:53,645 --> 00:25:56,120
I, um,
I-I need to run an errand.

543
00:25:56,176 --> 00:25:57,700
Will you come with me?

544
00:25:57,758 --> 00:25:59,110
Yeah.

545
00:26:05,236 --> 00:26:07,152
What do you mean,
you're running away?

546
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,392
I am going to the airport
and taking the first flight

547
00:26:09,446 --> 00:26:11,662
to wherever it is that people
go when they disappear.

548
00:26:11,715 --> 00:26:13,590
You don't need to disappear.

549
00:26:13,646 --> 00:26:15,000
Oh, yes, I do.

550
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:18,122
I destroyed my family.
Daniel made that quite clear.

551
00:26:18,175 --> 00:26:19,451
They're better off without me.

552
00:26:19,508 --> 00:26:21,210
No, they're not.

553
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:24,550
Betty, I have already
caused them so much pain.

554
00:26:24,606 --> 00:26:27,331
I need to go far away where
I don't hurt them anymore.

555
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:29,022
You know what?
You're not thinking very clearly.

556
00:26:29,057 --> 00:26:30,321
We should call Daniel.

557
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:31,420
Maybe you're right.

558
00:26:31,478 --> 00:26:33,071
Let--let me see your phone.

559
00:26:36,988 --> 00:26:39,190
Did that jump out of my hand?

560
00:26:39,245 --> 00:26:41,482
- Now let me have the credit card.
- No.

561
00:26:41,538 --> 00:26:44,710
I... don't have it.

562
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:47,501
I left it at home in Queens.

563
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:49,391
It's on the way to the airport.

564
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:51,243
Excuse me. Hi.
I'm sorry to interrupt,

565
00:26:51,297 --> 00:26:53,511
but I'm parked in a
horse and carriage zone.

566
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:55,390
Who is this?

567
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:59,060
Um, this is Dr. Farkas.
We are sort of on a date.

568
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:02,002
Doctor? I thought it was
the accountant you liked.

569
00:27:02,057 --> 00:27:03,852
No, no, Mrs. Meade, no.

570
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:07,090
Uh, he has a girlfriend.
That was a very long time ago.

571
00:27:07,146 --> 00:27:09,422
We're friends.
We're just friends.

572
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:10,893
I believe you.

573
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:16,022
Well, this is an
awkward moment.

574
00:27:17,145 --> 00:27:18,541
Leave it to me.

575
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:20,423
I kill everything.

576
00:27:22,506 --> 00:27:24,931
Sex on a dirty floor.

577
00:27:24,986 --> 00:27:27,573
Daniel Meade--
always a class act.

578
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:30,622
So Marc has pleased you?

579
00:27:30,678 --> 00:27:32,760
Oh, stop talking in
the third person

580
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:35,222
and take your pick
from the goody basket.

581
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:37,142
I have a delivery to make.

582
00:27:42,585 --> 00:27:45,380
That lying bastard!

583
00:27:45,537 --> 00:27:49,120
Alexis, I have some expense
report issues to go over.

584
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:54,750
I'm sorry. Did I...
interrupt something?

585
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:56,551
My brother lied to me.

586
00:27:56,735 --> 00:27:59,083
He's sleeping with Grace Chin.

587
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,861
He said he didn't know her.

588
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:01,973
Interesting.

589
00:28:02,026 --> 00:28:04,641
You trusted Daniel,
and he betrayed you.

590
00:28:04,696 --> 00:28:07,690
I went through
something very similar

591
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,521
with a former friend.

592
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:22,182
Help. Please help. Help me!

593
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:23,520
Hello?

594
00:28:23,807 --> 00:28:25,822
You all right in there?

595
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,012
Oh, thank god.

596
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:29,902
I haven't been able
to pee all day,

597
00:28:29,957 --> 00:28:32,612
and I was simply trying
to stand over the toilet,

598
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:34,220
and now I can't get down.

599
00:28:34,276 --> 00:28:35,670
Okay, help.

600
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:45,072
You do know I'm gonna have to
talk to your mother tomorrow.

601
00:28:45,128 --> 00:28:47,633
Oh, yeah, you can try,
but she might disappear again.

602
00:28:47,688 --> 00:28:49,723
That's what she
does, disappear.

603
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:51,222
I told you. She's nuts.

604
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:54,232
Good, because that'll
be her defense.

605
00:28:54,288 --> 00:28:55,452
What?

606
00:28:55,556 --> 00:28:58,863
Daniel, I know she did it.

607
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:01,943
Grace, that's not true.

608
00:29:01,998 --> 00:29:04,333
Come on, Daniel.
Every time I bring up your mother,

609
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:07,073
you get all freaked out and
then you want to have sex.

610
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:11,031
You either have some weird oedipal
thing, or your mother's guilty.

611
00:29:11,087 --> 00:29:12,331
So...

612
00:29:12,926 --> 00:29:14,563
do you wanna have sex?

613
00:29:15,238 --> 00:29:17,183
I know you're trying
to protect her,

614
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:19,881
but hear me out. If your mother
confesses, I can help her.

615
00:29:19,936 --> 00:29:20,970
Oh, that's not an option.

616
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:23,441
I can have her doctor testify
that she was paranoid.

617
00:29:23,498 --> 00:29:25,352
You want her to plead insanity?

618
00:29:25,407 --> 00:29:28,671
I'll argue that she believed that
Fey Sommers was gonna kill her.

619
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,363
It was kill or be killed.

620
00:29:30,415 --> 00:29:32,141
You actually think
you can win this way?

621
00:29:32,198 --> 00:29:33,802
I know I can.

622
00:29:33,936 --> 00:29:36,220
Well, isn't this a surprise?

623
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:37,672
What the hell are
you doing here?

624
00:29:37,726 --> 00:29:41,052
All those angry women and
you never changed the locks?

625
00:29:41,617 --> 00:29:43,993
You must be Grace Chin. Hi.

626
00:29:44,097 --> 00:29:46,562
Daniel, that woman you
claimed you've never met?

627
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:48,351
She's in your bed.

628
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,820
Hmm. My,
what a cute little house.

629
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:56,772
I could put it
right in my pocket.

630
00:29:57,728 --> 00:29:59,882
Uh, so listen, it looks like
you've got your hands full here.

631
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:02,280
- I think I'm just gonna head off.
- No, no, no, no. Stay, stay.

632
00:30:02,318 --> 00:30:04,430
This is just gonna take a
couple of minutes, and then

633
00:30:04,466 --> 00:30:05,811
we can get back to our date.

634
00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:07,973
We can grab a drink or--
or get some pie.

635
00:30:08,027 --> 00:30:09,500
I love pie.
What's your favorite pie?

636
00:30:09,536 --> 00:30:11,632
- Uh, rhubarb.
- Oh, me, too.

637
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:13,960
Actually, blueberry,
but rhubarb sounds fun.

638
00:30:14,018 --> 00:30:15,972
Oh, you should really
steer away from blueberry.

639
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:18,162
- It stains your teeth.
- Really?

640
00:30:18,457 --> 00:30:20,541
Wow, you really can't bottle
this kind of chemistry.

641
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:23,453
Okay, Betty, there's a flight
to Vladivostok at midnight.

642
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:26,552
They just opened a W there.
I really need that credit card.

643
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,261
Mrs. Meade,
you don't need to do this.

644
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:30,881
- You didn't do anything.
- I killed Fey Sommers.

645
00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:34,120
Um... okay.
I know you think so,

646
00:30:34,175 --> 00:30:37,152
but Daniel told me that you tend to
make things up when you're drinking.

647
00:30:37,205 --> 00:30:39,622
Well, I'm not drinking now.

648
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:42,282
I had her brake lines cut.

649
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:46,312
I followed her for 18 miles,
till the fluid ran out.

650
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:50,663
I watched her crash into a tree
and burn and burn and burn.

651
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,393
- I'm gonna go.
- Oh, no. No, no, stay. Stay.

652
00:30:54,446 --> 00:30:56,991
It's from a movie.
It's just a game we play.

653
00:30:57,047 --> 00:30:58,480
Uh, guess the quote.

654
00:30:58,537 --> 00:30:59,930
Oh, that was "Firestarter."

655
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:02,223
Uh, my turn. "You complete me."

656
00:31:02,275 --> 00:31:03,743
- Uh, "Jerry Maguire."
- Yes!

657
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,403
Oh, wow. You're good at this.

658
00:31:05,455 --> 00:31:07,051
Betty, the credit card?

659
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:10,183
Oh, um, okay,
you two keep playing.

660
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:15,211
Oh, uh,
"life is like a box of chocolates."

661
00:31:15,265 --> 00:31:17,720
I've killed once.
I'll kill again.

662
00:31:17,778 --> 00:31:19,231
I don't know that one.

663
00:31:19,287 --> 00:31:20,321
Hello.

664
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:23,630
You must be Betty's father.
Claire Meade, Daniel's mother.

665
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:25,741
Hi. And, uh, who is this?

666
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:27,332
This is Betty's date.

667
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,962
Oh, you must be Henry.
I've heard a lot about you.

668
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:32,561
No, no, no.
The accountant has a girlfriend.

669
00:31:32,616 --> 00:31:34,721
This is the orthodontist.

670
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:38,310
Oh. Uh, you seem... nice.

671
00:31:38,425 --> 00:31:41,602
Well, I've seen the accountant.
Much hotter.

672
00:31:42,008 --> 00:31:43,642
Betty, I really gotta go.

673
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:46,931
No! Stay!
At least I owe you a cup of coffee.

674
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:48,182
I'll make some.

675
00:31:48,238 --> 00:31:50,373
Mrs. Meade,
what do you take for coffee?

676
00:31:50,428 --> 00:31:52,711
Vodka and ice, hold the coffee.

677
00:31:52,766 --> 00:31:54,840
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, thanks.

678
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:03,073
Come on, Daniel. Come on.

679
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:05,161
Come on, Daniel! Come on!

680
00:32:06,806 --> 00:32:07,950
What do you want?

681
00:32:08,007 --> 00:32:10,042
I want her to recuse
herself from the case.

682
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:12,700
Why? My relationship with Daniel
doesn't affect my ability

683
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:14,292
to defend your father.

684
00:32:14,345 --> 00:32:16,631
Let's hope the judge thinks
so when I give this to him.

685
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:19,853
Or maybe I'll put it on the internet.
I'm sure there are tons of people out there

686
00:32:19,888 --> 00:32:22,552
who would love seeing a lawyer
getting screwed for a change.

687
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,792
Okay.

688
00:32:24,238 --> 00:32:26,181
The Chin is done here.

689
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:28,131
No, no, no. Wait. Wait.
What are you saying?

690
00:32:28,186 --> 00:32:30,281
She's saying she doesn't
want to ruin her career.

691
00:32:30,337 --> 00:32:32,490
This isn't about my career.
I just don't have the time

692
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:34,013
or the patience for you people.

693
00:32:34,067 --> 00:32:37,642
I have enough murderers to
put back on the street,

694
00:32:37,697 --> 00:32:40,482
and their families
actually support them.

695
00:32:40,535 --> 00:32:43,151
You don't need a lawyer.
You need a good shrink...

696
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:46,113
and maybe a closer shave.

697
00:32:46,438 --> 00:32:47,981
How could you do this?

698
00:32:48,295 --> 00:32:49,830
How could you help our father?

699
00:32:49,888 --> 00:32:51,193
Our father's innocent.

700
00:32:51,246 --> 00:32:52,843
Mom killed Fey.

701
00:32:52,896 --> 00:32:53,753
What?

702
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:55,761
Why do you think I have
to keep this from you?

703
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:57,901
You never listen to me.
I can't talk to you.

704
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:02,270
Mom is guilty. You just ran the
best lawyer in town out my door.

705
00:33:02,326 --> 00:33:04,881
You just put our
mother in prison.

706
00:33:11,025 --> 00:33:14,043
- So you're the one?
- I beg your pardon?

707
00:33:14,098 --> 00:33:16,510
You're the ho stealing my man.

708
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:22,172
It's unlikely that we would
have the same man in common.

709
00:33:22,227 --> 00:33:24,583
We certainly don't have
the same hairdresser.

710
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,751
Oh, you just crossed the line.

711
00:33:28,308 --> 00:33:31,013
Did you just shove me?

712
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:37,922
Hey, hey--
oh, you just slapped me.

713
00:33:37,977 --> 00:33:39,330
Wait, wait, wait.
What's going on?

714
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:41,500
I have no idea
how this started.

715
00:33:41,555 --> 00:33:43,582
All I know is that tonight we were
supposed to get a credit card

716
00:33:43,618 --> 00:33:44,690
and leave the country.

717
00:33:44,745 --> 00:33:47,533
So you were gonna run off and marry
this bag of bones for a green card?

718
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,103
"Bag of bones"?

719
00:33:49,156 --> 00:33:50,740
I-I'm not marrying anybody.

720
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:53,903
Constance, please.
Can we talk about this in the kitchen?

721
00:33:53,955 --> 00:33:56,253
- Who's carrot cake anyway?
- That's Betty's date.

722
00:33:56,308 --> 00:33:57,463
Oh, so that's the accountant?

723
00:33:57,498 --> 00:33:59,372
No, no. That's Henry.

724
00:33:59,427 --> 00:34:01,723
So what's with you and
the skinny blonde bitch?

725
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:04,723
Mrs. Meade is not
my girlfriend.

726
00:34:04,978 --> 00:34:06,840
And by the way, Constance,

727
00:34:06,896 --> 00:34:08,410
neither are you.

728
00:34:08,595 --> 00:34:10,160
Why are you stalking me?

729
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:12,782
Excuse me?
I am not stalking you.

730
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:15,971
I am monitoring an illegal
immigrant who is a flight risk?

731
00:34:16,028 --> 00:34:17,470
I'm not flying anywhere.

732
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:21,200
Look, look, let me make a cup of
one of your international coffees...

733
00:34:22,438 --> 00:34:25,163
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What is is?

734
00:34:25,266 --> 00:34:26,683
A tracking device,

735
00:34:26,735 --> 00:34:29,641
I'm doing it for your own good, nacho,
before you do something you'll regret.

736
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:31,450
Constance, be reasonable.

737
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:33,632
And with this tracking device,

738
00:34:33,686 --> 00:34:37,453
I will know where you are
every minute of every day.

739
00:34:37,506 --> 00:34:39,423
You step outside this house...

740
00:34:40,825 --> 00:34:42,293
and I will know.

741
00:34:42,437 --> 00:34:45,421
And I'm guessing miss
fancy pants out there

742
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:47,700
don't live in this 'hood.

743
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:50,072
What was that noise?

744
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:52,820
- What are you doing?
- Uh, leaving.

745
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:55,660
No, no, no. I'm almost done here,
and then we can go get that pie.

746
00:34:55,716 --> 00:34:57,541
Betty, there's not
gonna be any pie.

747
00:34:57,597 --> 00:34:58,330
Why?

748
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,723
It's obvious you still
have feelings for Henry.

749
00:35:00,775 --> 00:35:01,913
What?

750
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:03,761
No, I-I don't.

751
00:35:03,817 --> 00:35:05,583
Betty, I could see
it at the party,

752
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:08,570
and I think everyone
else can see it, too.

753
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:16,282
Okay.

754
00:35:18,107 --> 00:35:19,410
I'm sorry.

755
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:22,293
I-I really do think
you're a great guy.

756
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:26,533
I guess I-I just asked you
out for all the wrong reasons.

757
00:35:26,586 --> 00:35:28,123
I don't know. It's okay.

758
00:35:28,177 --> 00:35:31,423
I should probably know better
than to date my patients anyway,

759
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:34,163
especially the cute ones.

760
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:47,651
Um... I-I will see you at
your appointment next month.

761
00:35:47,706 --> 00:35:48,843
Okay.

762
00:35:52,968 --> 00:35:54,663
"Here's looking at you, kid."

763
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:56,082
"Casablanca."

764
00:36:02,776 --> 00:36:03,900
Well...

765
00:36:05,817 --> 00:36:07,410
that was very sweet.

766
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,700
Sticky, but sweet.

767
00:36:10,388 --> 00:36:11,662
Tick-tock, Betty.

768
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:12,982
I have a flight to catch.

769
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,720
Now where's that credit card?

770
00:36:23,336 --> 00:36:25,810
Okay, I got it.

771
00:36:28,845 --> 00:36:31,613
Betty, that's a library card.

772
00:36:32,286 --> 00:36:33,442
Oh, my god.

773
00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:37,060
I must have checked out the books with
the credit card. I'll go call them.

774
00:36:37,116 --> 00:36:38,673
Betty, you're lying.

775
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:43,093
With so many saints in your living room,
how can you lie like that?

776
00:36:43,146 --> 00:36:44,923
You called Daniel, didn't you?

777
00:36:44,978 --> 00:36:46,550
I had to.

778
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:50,243
Look, if you did what
you said you did,

779
00:36:50,298 --> 00:36:52,811
then your family has
to deel with this.

780
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:54,132
Family.

781
00:36:55,118 --> 00:36:57,142
There's not much
of a family left.

782
00:36:57,225 --> 00:37:00,262
My husband spent 20 years of our
marriage in love with another woman,

783
00:37:00,316 --> 00:37:02,720
and she flaunted
it in front of me.

784
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:07,052
I watched the man I love
love someone else.

785
00:37:09,826 --> 00:37:11,170
And it killed me.

786
00:37:13,756 --> 00:37:18,113
Promise me you won't make the
same mistake that I did, Betty.

787
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:21,680
I promise.

788
00:37:31,206 --> 00:37:32,563
What do I do?

789
00:37:32,766 --> 00:37:33,983
I don't know,

790
00:37:35,288 --> 00:37:38,633
but I don't think that
running away is the answer.

791
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,482
I mean...

792
00:37:42,985 --> 00:37:45,460
won't it just keep
following you?

793
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:47,032
Maybe...

794
00:37:47,286 --> 00:37:50,532
we both need to
be strong and...

795
00:37:51,128 --> 00:37:53,903
face the things that
we don't want to,

796
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:56,110
no matter how scary they are,

797
00:37:57,147 --> 00:37:58,553
because...

798
00:37:59,136 --> 00:38:02,003
that's the only way we can
live with ourselves.

799
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:05,662
You're a smart girl, Betty.

800
00:38:12,158 --> 00:38:14,252
I need to make a phone call.

801
00:38:20,505 --> 00:38:22,310
Reporting live in
Jackson Heights, Queens,

802
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:25,412
where Claire Meade, wife of
publishing magnate Bradford Meade,

803
00:38:25,465 --> 00:38:27,461
has turned herself in
to the authorities.

804
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:31,483
The district attorney has confirmed that
Mrs. Meade has confessed to the murder

805
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:34,540
of former "Mode"
editor-in-chief Fey Sommers,

806
00:38:34,596 --> 00:38:38,550
the crime for which Mrs.
Meade's husband is currently in custody.

807
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:42,370
Further inquiries revealed that Mr.
Meade's defense attorney, Grace Chin,

808
00:38:42,427 --> 00:38:44,731
has removed herself
from the case.

809
00:38:44,787 --> 00:38:47,090
Now that's what I
call brotherly love.

810
00:38:47,146 --> 00:38:48,531
It's a shame, really.

811
00:38:48,585 --> 00:38:50,533
That family's just
beyond repair.

812
00:38:50,587 --> 00:38:53,553
Bradford Meade is expected to be
released in the next 24 hours

813
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:55,442
and all murder charges dropped.

814
00:38:55,496 --> 00:38:57,590
Alexis is not gonna like that.

815
00:38:57,646 --> 00:39:00,010
She didn't spend much
time at the top.

816
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:01,652
Nice work...

817
00:39:02,145 --> 00:39:03,633
both of you.

818
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:18,373
Oswald Lorenzo has
another treat for you.

819
00:39:18,426 --> 00:39:21,432
Listen, you trendy
little monkey,

820
00:39:21,488 --> 00:39:24,560
you can tell your boss he
completely humiliated me.

821
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:26,972
I have rubber burns
all over my ass,

822
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:29,303
and it took two sticks of
butter just to get the top off.

823
00:39:29,346 --> 00:39:31,260
Fashion is a pain.

824
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:33,722
That dress looked awful.

825
00:39:33,776 --> 00:39:35,153
Of course it did.

826
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:37,423
You didn't have the hat.

827
00:39:38,695 --> 00:39:40,410
It comes with a hat?

828
00:39:41,637 --> 00:39:43,571
I totally have a hat face.

829
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:44,863
I know.

830
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:51,001
Enjoy!

831
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:59,043
Oh, my god. She's wearing it!

832
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,443
Oh, she loves it.

833
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:02,353
She looks like a traffic cone.

834
00:40:02,957 --> 00:40:05,703
That'll teach that bitch
to shove me in a bar.

835
00:40:12,108 --> 00:40:13,721
- Hey.
- Oh. Hi.

836
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:15,560
You left early last night.
I didn't get a--

837
00:40:15,618 --> 00:40:18,791
I mean, Charlie and I didn't get
a chance to talk to you very much.

838
00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:21,860
I guess that whole Claire Meade thing
really spiraled out of control, huh?

839
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:23,091
What was that all about?

840
00:40:23,145 --> 00:40:26,131
It's a long story.
Most of it's in "the New York Times."

841
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:28,411
Do you want to get lunch
with me and Charlie today?

842
00:40:28,448 --> 00:40:30,220
- There's this new place--
- I can't.

843
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:35,013
Uh, okay.

844
00:40:35,068 --> 00:40:36,261
Maybe tomorrow then.

845
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:39,273
No. I can't.

846
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:45,091
I can't spend time with you
and your girlfriend, Henry.

847
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:47,601
It's just not...

848
00:40:49,608 --> 00:40:51,252
good for me.

849
00:40:52,397 --> 00:40:53,591
Sure.

850
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:55,903
Okay.

851
00:40:56,865 --> 00:41:00,091
I guess, uh,
I just thought we could all be friends.

852
00:41:00,146 --> 00:41:01,420
Yeah.

853
00:41:02,555 --> 00:41:03,972
I just...

854
00:41:04,025 --> 00:41:06,083
I don't really think that I...

855
00:41:06,138 --> 00:41:08,283
I can do that...

856
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:09,843
right now.

857
00:41:10,556 --> 00:41:11,921
So...

858
00:41:12,685 --> 00:41:14,431
what does that make us?

859
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:18,140
Two people who work
in the same building.

860
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,050
Okay.

861
00:41:36,775 --> 00:41:38,401
I saved you a slice.

862
00:41:58,407 --> 00:42:00,803
Daniel Meade's office.
This is Betty Suarez.

863
00:42:01,205 --> 00:42:02,442
Yes.

864
00:42:02,545 --> 00:42:04,492
What time is best to
return your call?

865
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:06,601
Great. I'll let him know.

866
00:42:06,655 --> 00:42:07,971
Have a good day.
