MAYBE IF WE CAN FIND OUT
WHO YOUR REAL FATHER IS....
(Amanda scoffs)

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,600
He could be anybody.

9
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,400
THEY DENIED MY VISA.

10
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,800
I HAVE TO STAY HERE
FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG.

11
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,500
I MAY NOT HAVE "MODE,"
BUT VERY SOON,

12
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,100
I WILL HAVE EVERYTHING ELSE,
INCLUDING YOUR HUSBAND.

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,600
ALEXIS, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,800
WHY DO YOU KEEP CALLING ME
ALEXIS?

15
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,900
IT'S ME, ALEX.

16
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,700
THIS WHOLE THING WITH HENRY,
IT FINALLY GOT TO ME.

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,000
(Daniel) HENRY'S GONE.

18
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,900
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
FOR MY KID.

19
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,800
(sobs)
OH, GOD, HE'S GONE.

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,800
"AND IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES
WHICH CHALLENGE US ????

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,800
I'm remind??? FAMILIES"...

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,200
AND I ???

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,300
DON'T WORRY.
NO ONE NOTICED.

24
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,600
AND I WAS SAYING,
"LIKE ALL GREAT FAMILIES,

25
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,100
WE WILL PULL THROUGH THIS
TOGETHER."

26
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,900
 <i>BRAVA! BRAVA!</i>

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,300
 <i>BRAVA!</i>
(applause)

28
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,300
SO THAT IS
MY LETTER FROM THE EDITOR

29
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,700
COMMENTING ON THE RECENT
MEADE FAMILY MISFORTUNES.

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,300
BETTY?

31
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,500
UM, I'M SORRY, BUT SHOULDN'T
THE LETTER FROM THE EDITOR

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,900
BE WRITTEN BY THE EDITOR--
DANIEL?

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,600
OH, BETTY,

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,200
DEAR, PIE-EYED,
PIE-EATING BETTY.

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,300
HIS SISTER
HAS LOST HER MEMORY.

36
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,400
HE'S STILL IN A WHEELCHAIR.

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,600
NOW I KNOW HE PAYS YOU FOR YOUR
SOUTH-OF-THE-BORDER SPIRIT,

38
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,200
BUT LET'S GIVE DANIEL
A BREAK.

39
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,800
BUT HE'S FINE.
HE COULD TOTALLY DO--

40
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,100
OKAY, PEOPLE,????

41
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,100
LET'S GET TO WORK.

42
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,300
 <i>(woman) DR. FINE, PROCTOLOGY.</i>
 <i>DR. FINE...</i>

43
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,100
PARTIAL RETROGRADE AMNESIA

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,200
THE LAST THING
ALEXIS REMEMBERS

45
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,300
IS MOM'S BIRTHDAY PARTY
TWO YEARS AGO.

46
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,100
NOTHING SINCE THEN. BLANK.

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,400
SHE DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER
BECOMING A WOMAN.

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,200
LOOK AT HER.

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,800
SHE'S BEEN DOING THAT
ALL NIGHT.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,700
AS FAR AS ALEXIS KNOWS,
WE'RE A HAPPY FAMILY.

51
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,600
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
MOM AND DAD ARE DIVORCED.

52
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
SHE DOESN'T KNOW MOM
ESCAPED FROM PRISON,

53
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,400
OR WAS IN PRISON,
FOR THAT MATTER.

54
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,100
BETTY?

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,000
SORRY. I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PUT MYSELF IN HER SHOES.

56
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,400
OKAY,
ARE YOU READY TO GO?

57
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,500
NO, NO, NO, NO. I CAN'T.
I GOTTA STAY WITH HER.

58
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
I'M THE REASON SHE'S HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

59
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,900
WHAT? NO. DANIEL, WILHELMINA HAS
BEEN RUNNING "MODE" BY HERSELF.

60
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,700
SHE HASN'T TAKEN
ANY OF YOUR CHANGES,

61
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,900
AND SHE WROTE
THE LETTER FROM THE EDITOR.

62
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,100
THE ISSUE SHIPS TOMORROW.

63
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,600
DON'T YOU AT LEAST
WANT TO SIGN OFF ON THE BOOK?

64
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,000
SEE, THAT'S ANOTHER THING.
HOW I AM SUPPOSED TO TELL ALEXIS

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,200
OUR FATHER
IS MARRYING WILHELMINA?

66
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,400
SO THAT'S A YES
ON SEEING THE BOOK?
YEAH, GET THE BOOK.

67
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
(Alexis) DANIEL?

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,700
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

69
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,100
<i>CLAIRE MEADE IS STILL AT LARGE</i>

70
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,600
 <i>AFTER ESCAPING FROM RIKERS</i>
 <i>THREE WEEKS AGO.</i>

71
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,400
 <i>CLAIRE, IF YOU'RE WATCHING,</i>
 <i>LOSE THE ANKLE BRACELET.</i>

72
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,000
 <i>CHUNKY IS OUT.</i>

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,600
A LOCK OF YOUR HAIR
IN THIS ONE

74
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,900
AND A PIECE OF BRADFORD'S
EAR HAIR IN THIS ONE.

75
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,400
HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT?

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,300
D.N.A. TESTING?
OH, NOT THE FIRST TIME.

77
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,900
SO IN 24 HOURS,
WE WILL HAVE CONCLUSIVE PROOF

78
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,900
IF BRADFORD MEADE
IS YO' DADDY.

79
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,500
OH. (giggles)

80
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,300
YOU OKAY?
I DON'T KNOW.

81
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,900
I JUST STARE
AT HER PICTURE ALL DAY,

82
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,800
AND THEN I STARE AT MYSELF
IN THE MIRROR.

83
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,600
MORE THAN USUAL?
YEAH.

84
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,800
OH.
I JUST WISH
I GOT TO KNOW HER BETTER.

85
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,900
YEAH, YEAH, AND I WISH

86
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,800
I GOT TO KNOW MARLON BRANDO
BEFORE HE GOT FAT,

87
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,500
BUT CAN WE CUT
TO WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE?

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,800
THERE'S A FEY SOMMERS ESTATE
OUT THERE WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

89
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,100
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM THE LAWYERS YET?

90
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,500
I SHOULD BE GETTING THE NEWS
LATER TODAY.

91
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,300
JUST WAITING TO HEAR
FROM THE PROBATE JUDGE.

92
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,300
MOM, ALL THE BOXES
ARE STILL HERE.

93
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,100
YEAH, I KNOW.
I'M STILL GOING THROUGH THEM.

94
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,500
YOUR FATHER HAD
A LOT OF GREAT STUFF AT HIS APARTMENT,
LIKE THESE.

95
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,200
YOU CAN'T FIND THESE
ANYWHERE.

96
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,400
MOM, WE'RE IN QUEENS.
YOU CAN FIND THOSE <i>EVERYWHERE.</i>

97
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
THEY WERE YOUR FATHER'S.
WE'RE KEEPING THEM.

98
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,100
HERE'S YOUR LUNCH
FOR YOUR FIRST DAY AT "MODE,"

99
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,900
MR. BIG SHOT INTERN!

100
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,000
YOU WANT ME
TO <i>BRING</i> MY LUNCH?

101
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,900
MOM,
THE FAMOUS "MODE" CAFETERIA?

102
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,500
WHERE NAOMI CAMPBELL HAD
A TUNA MELT AND A MELTDOWN?

103
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,300
THEY NOW HAVE IT
ON THE MENU--

104
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
THE NAOMI CAMPBELL
TUNA MELTDOWN.

105
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,200
(whispers) OH.
YEAH.

106
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,200
(normal voice) DO YOU KNOW
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU?

107
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
AND I KNOW YOUR FATHER
WOULD BE, TOO.

108
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,900
OH! MWAH. THAT FACE!

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,400
AND CALL RANDY DEZERGA.

110
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,000
SEE IF HE'S FREE
TO SHOOT THE MILAN SHOWS.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,900
WILL DO, WIL.

112
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,500
OH, AND I GOT
A CALL FROM ALEXA D--AAH!

113
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,000
WHAT IS THAT?

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,500
DID I FORGET TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO DWAYNE, MY NEW BODYGUARD?

115
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,300
I CAN'T KEEP CHECKING
OVER MY SHOULDER

116
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,600
TO SEE
IF THAT CRAZY CLAIRE MEADE'S

117
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,700
RUNNING AFTER ME
WITH A BOTTLE OF ACID.

118
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,500
SO HE'LL JUST ATTACK ANYONE?

119
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,200
IF HE FEELS I'M IN DANGER.

120
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,300
OH, MY GOD! IT'S CLAIRE MEADE
CHARGING FOR US.

121
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,600
(Betty) HELP!

122
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,800
RELEASE, DWAYNE.

123
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,300
WHOA! EXCUSE ME!
WHAT DO YOU WANT, BETTY?

124
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,500
I WAS JUST... COMING
TO GET THE BOOK

125
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,000
SO DANIEL
COULD SIGN OFF ON IT.

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,100
TELL DANIEL THE ISSUE
WILL BE FILLED

127
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,800
WITH PRETTY GIRLS
WEARING SKIMPY LITTLE DRESSES.

128
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,000
THAT'S ALL HE CARES ABOUT
ANYWAY.

129
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,700
BUT I THINK THAT HE REAL--
BYE, BETTY.

130
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,800
BUT HE REAL--
GOOD-BYE, BETTY.

131
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,600
I KNOW THAT--
DWAYNE.

132
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,300
OKAY, OKAY.
I'M LEAVING.

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,200
UH, CONFIRM MY LUNCH
WITH NORA EPHRON

134
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,900
AND MAKE SURE DWAYNE
GETS A SET OF MY HOUSE KEYS.

135
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,700
MARC...
OH.

136
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,100
YOU KNOW DANIEL
NEEDS TO SEE THE BOOK

137
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,100
BEFORE IT GOES
TO THE PRINTER.

138
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,400
COME ON.
PLEASE. THIS IS MY JOB.

139
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,800
COULDN'T I JUST BORROW IT
FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR?

140
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,300
GET AWAY FROM MY DESK, OR I'LL ???

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,500
WHAT ARE THESE?

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,200
THIS SAYS
"TO DANIEL MEADE."

143
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,900
THEY'RE JUST SOME NOTES
FROM THE EDITORS.

144
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,800
DON'T YOU WORRY
YOUR BUSHY LITTLE HEAD ABOUT IT.

145
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,400
WILHELMINA'S
ALREADY APPROVED THEM.

146
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,500
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

147
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,000
HE HASN'T EVEN SEEN THEM!
OOPS.

148
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,400
NOW I REALLY NEED
TO SEE THAT BOOK.

149
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,100
LOOK, IT'S ????

150
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,600
SO I COULDN'T
GIVE IT TO YOU

151
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,200
EVEN IF I WANTED TO,
WHICH I DON'T.

152
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,900
OH, DWAYNE.
IT'S A KEY. DON'T EAT IT.

153
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,300
MARC, I NEED TO FIRE CHLOE
IN PRODUCTION.

154
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,100
I WANT YOU TO STAND NEXT TO ME
AND NOD THOUGHTFULLY.
MM.

155
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100

YOU'RE NOT IN TUCSON.

162

YEAH, THANKS. I GOT THE FLOWERS.
THAT WAS VERY SWEET.

169
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,000
YEAH. YEAH, IT'S ALL GOING
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,600
I'VE GOT MY BABY BOOKS,

171
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,400
I'M TAKING THE INFANT
C.P.R. CLASS.

172
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

173
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,200
HENRY,
IT'S OKAY TO BE EXCITED.

174
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,000
I REALLY AM.

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,500
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT BECOMING A FATHER.

176
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,100
YOU KNOW, I COULD WORK
MY WHOLE LIFE

177
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,400
AND NEVER BE
THE BEST ACCOUNTANT,

178
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,200
BUT MAYBE I-I CAN BE
THE BEST DAD.

179
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,800
I THINK YOU WILL BE.

180
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,700
LISTEN,
THE REASON I'M HERE...

181
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
UH-HUH.

182
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,200
I COULDN'T REALLY FIND
A GREAT JOB IN TUCSON,

183
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,500
AND THE MEADE HEALTH INSURANCE
WOULD COVER

184
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,400
ALL THE MEDICAL EXPENSES
FOR THE BABY, SO--

185
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,300
OH. SO YOU'RE COMING
BACK TO WORK.

186
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,600
ONLY IF IT'S OKAY
WITH YOU, BETTY.

187
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,500
IF YOU THINK IT'S A PROBLEM,
I'LL TURN DOWN THE JOB,

188
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,200
BECAUSE I KNOW,
IT--IT MIGHT BE WEIRD.

189
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,000
NO!
NO?

190
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,800
I MEAN "NO"

191
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,900
IT'S ????

192
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,600
NOT "NO," DON'T TAKE THE JOB.
WHY WOULD IT BE WEIRD?

193
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,500
BECAUSE WE GOT
A LITTLE ROMANTIC?

194
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
WE WERE YOUNG
AND INNOCENT THEN.

195
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,400
AH, YOUTH. BUT EVERYTHING'S
COOL BETWEEN US.

196
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,100
WE COULD JUST BE FRIENDS.
BUDDIES.

197
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,000
BUDDIES?

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,600
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
LIKE, "HEY, BUDDY."

199
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,100
UH, "WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?"

200
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,600
UH, "WHAT'S THE DILLYO?"

201
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,100
"DILLYO"?

202
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,200
I CAN'T BE BUDDIES WITH HIM.
AND HE WAS ALL LIKE,

203
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,600
"OH, ARE YOU OKAY
WITH ME WORKING HERE?"

204
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,000
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO SAY, NO?

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,900
"NO, YOU CAN'T MAKE MONEY
FOR YOUR BABY."

206
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,100
DOWN WITH BABIES!
(baby cries)

207
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,500
BETTY, YOU NEED TO TELL HIM
MAYBE THE BABY ISN'T EVEN HIS.

208
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,400
AND MAYBE IT IS.
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS?

209
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,300
IF CHARLIE
WAS HAVING SEX WITH FARKAS,

210
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,200
SHE WAS PROBABLY HAVING SEX
WITH A MILLION GUYS.

211
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,300
'CAUSE YOU KNOW SHE'S A SLUT.
THE BABY COULD BE ANYBODY'S.

212
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,000
IT COULD BE THAT GUY'S. HEY,
DID YOU SLEEP WITH CHARLIE?

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,500
YOU MIGHT BE HAVING A BABY.

214
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,700
BETTY, HENRY NEEDS
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

215
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,300
WELL, NOT FROM ME. I'M NOT
BREAKING APART A FAMILY.

216
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,900
I'VE GOT ENOUGH DRAMA
IN MY LIFE.

217
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,400
MY DAD IS STUCK IN MEXICO.
HE CAN'T COME HOME.

218
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,200
THAT'S MORE THAN
I CAN DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW.

219
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,500
OKAY, WE'RE HERE.

220
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,300
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"WE'RE HERE"?

221
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,400
OH, DIDN'T I TELL YOU?

222
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,100
WE'RE BREAKING
INTO WILHELMINA'S APARTMENT.

223
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,500
WHAT?

224
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,200
NOW YOU NEED SUNSCREEN.
HEY.

225
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,400
BETTY'S SON.
NEPHEW.

226
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,100
MEH.

227
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,500
SO I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR... MOTHER?
FATHER.

228
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,700
YES, YES. WE SIGN
SO MANY CARDS HERE.

229
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AT "MODE"?

230
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,000
YOU AND YOUR LITTLE BAND
OF RUFFIANS PICKING POCKETS?

231
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,200
MY AUNT BETTY GOT ME
A SUMMER INTERNSHIP.

232
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,600
OH. GET THAT FOR ME

233
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,400
THIS COULD BE FUN.
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING DONE?

234
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,300
BETTY HAS ME SHARPENING PENCILS.
I MEAN, I LOVE HER, BUT YAWN.

235
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,500
YEAH, HOW DO YOU LIVE
WITH THAT? LET'S SEE.

236
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,500
WILHELMINA NEEDS
HER CONTACTS UPDATED.

237
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,000
ANY INTEREST?

238
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,700
THIS IS WILHELMINA'S?

239
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,000
MM-HMM.

240
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,900
GOOD AFTERNOON.
I'M LOOKING FOR AMANDA TANEN.

241
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,700
I'M FROM RICHMAN,
BRETT AND JACOBS.

242
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,800
THE LAWYERS?
WHAT DO I GET? AM I RICH?

243
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,300
I TAKE IT
YOU'RE AMANDA TANEN.

244
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,200
OH, MY GOD.DO I get this watch?

245
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,400
THAT IS MINE.
PLEASE SIGN THIS.

246
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,600
WHAT ABOUT
THE CIGARETTE CASE?

247
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,800
PLEASE STOP TOUCHING MY THINGS.

248
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,100
SO IT APPEARS
MISS SOMMERS' TOWN HOUSE,

249
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,400
WARDROBE AND AUTOMOBILES

250
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,200
WERE AUCTIONED OFF
AT THE TIME OF HER DEATH,

251
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,400
AND THE PROCEEDS
WERE GIVEN TO CHARITY.

252
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,100
YOU MEAN IT'S ALL GONE?

253
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,800
NOT EVERYTHING.

254
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,100
THIS IS FOR YOU.

255
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,000
AAH! WHAT IS THAT?

256
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,100
IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S
BELOVED DOG HALSTON.

257
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,900
NICE TRY, SLICK,

258
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,300
BUT YOU'RE NOT STICKING ME
WITH THIS GREMLIN.

259
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,400
DID I HAPPEN TO MENTION

260
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,000
THERE'S A $1,000-A-WEEK
ALLOWANCE

261
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,100
FOR WHOEVER AGREES
TO CARE FOR HIM?

262
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,300
OH!

263
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,000
OH, YES.

264
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,300
(baby talk voice)
WHO'S THE LITTLE BABY?

265
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,200
SO YOU TOLD ALEXIS
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER AND FEY?

266
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,900
LOOK, SHE FOUND OUT
ABOUT MOM ON TV,

267
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,600
BUT I AM NOT GONNA
BE THE ONE TO TELL ALEXIS

268
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,100
YOU DIVORCED MOM
TO MARRY WILHELMINA,

269
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,400
OR THAT YOU REJECTED
YOUR OWN CHILD

270
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,100
BECAUSE SHE BECAME A WOMAN.

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,200
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
TELLING ALEXIS THE TRUTH.

272
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,800
THEN GREAT. HER ROOM'S
RIGHT DOWN THERE.

273
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE ACTUALLY
IN LUCIFER'S CHAMBER...

274
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,500
BEELZEBUB'S LAIR...

275
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,900
THE DEVIL'S RUMPUS ROOM.

276
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,000
OOH, LOOK. A PHOTOGRAPH
OF WILHELMINA WITH DICK CHENEY.

277
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,800
CHRISTINA, PLEASE STOP
ENJOYING YOURSELF AND HELP.

278
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,500
WE'VE GOT TO GET THE BOOK
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

279
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,700
(whispers) THE BEDROOM.

280
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,700
(normal voice) SATAN'S BOUDOIR.
VAMPIRA'S--
STOP IT.

281
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,400
10 BUCKS SAYS
THERE'S A COAT IN THERE

282
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
MADE OUT
OF DALMATIAN PUPPIES.

283
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,700
(gasps) HERE IT IS.
I GOT IT. HERE IT IS.

284
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,700
WHO IS THAT?
(Wilhelmina speaking
indistinctly)

285
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,700
WILHELMINA'S SUPPOSED
TO BE AT LUNCH WITH NORA EPHRON.

286
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,200
(man laughs)
THAT'S NOT NORA EPHRON.

287
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,300
THAT'S A MAN.
IT'S MR. MEADE.

288
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,000
THEY'RE HERE FOR A QUICKIE,
AN AFTERNOON DELIGHT.

289
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,800
AFTERNOON DE--
THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS?

290
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,000
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT SONG
TILL JUST NOW.
(door closes)

291
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,800
OKAY, UM, UNDER THE BED.

292
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,700
(gasps)
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

293
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,100
(Wilhelmina) I'M SO HAPPY
TO GET OUT OF THAT OFFICE.

294
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,700
THIS IS JUST SO DECADENT.

295
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,300
EVERYONE AT THE OFFICE THINKS I'M HAVING LUNCH
WITH THE GREAT NORA EPHRON.

296
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,300
LITTLE DO THEY KNOW,

297
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,400
NORA'S BEEN COVERING
MY DAYTIME ROMPS FOR YEARS.

298
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,100
YOU SEEM A LITTLE TENSE.
HOW ABOUT A BACK RUB?

299
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,600
(whispers)
THAT'S NOT MR. MEADE.

300
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,400
CAN I BE ON TOP THIS TIME?

301
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,700
DON'T BE STUPID.

302
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
(TWO HOURS?)

303
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,500
(I HAVE TO PEE)

304
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,100
WELL, THAT WAS RELAXING.

305
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,800
I DO LOVE
AN AFTERNOON DELIGHT.

306
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,800
IS THAT
WHAT THAT SONG MEANS?

307
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,500
COME, DWAYNE.

308
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,700
I THINK I NEED SOME PROTECTING
IN THE SHOWER.

309
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,200
 <i>(man) AND THE PITCH.</i>
 <i>BALL THREE...</i>

310
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,600
OH, COME ON.
THAT WAS A STRIKE, YOU IDIOT!

311
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,800
NOT INTERRUPTING, AM I?

312
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,700
(scoffs)
JUST ANOTHER BLOWN SAVE.

313
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,500
YEAH, WE COULD STILL USE
A GOOD CLOSER.

314
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,100
I SEE THERE'S SOME OF ALEX
STILL IN THERE.

315
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,600
WHAT WAS THAT?

316
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,400
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

317
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,100
WHAT'S UP, DAD?

318
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,700
YOU HAVEN'T CALLED ME THAT
IN YEARS.

319
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,400
WELL, I-I WAS A LITTLE
HEADSTRONG WHEN I WAS ALEX.

320
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,400
MAYBE ALEXIS CAN HAVE
A SOFTER TOUCH.

321
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,700
MAYBE I CAN, TOO.

322
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,500
OKAY, WILHELMINA'S CONTACTS
ARE COMPLETELY REORGANIZED.

323
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,800
ALSO, I INVENTORIED
ALL THE GOWNS THAT SHE WORE

324
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,400
ON THE RED CARPET LAST YEAR
AND BOOKED HER TRAVEL TO PARIS

325
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,800
FOR THIS SEASON'S
COUTURE SHOWS.

326
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,400
AND WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

327
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,000
I DID IT IN UNDER AN HOUR.

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,100
AN HOUR?

329
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,600
YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING?

330
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,100
PRICING WEIMARANERS,
GETTING A PLUMBER FOR THE HOUSE IN BEDFORD,

331
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,600
SENDING WARREN BEATTY A 60th--

334
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,200
GETTING YELLED AT

335
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,000
AND ASKING CHRIS ROCK
TO WRITE A 10-MINUTE TOAST

336
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,400
THAT WILHELMINA
IS GIVING TO PATTY HEARST

337
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,200
TO MARK THE 33rd ANNIVERSARY
OF HER KIDNAPPING--

338
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,800
AND <i>THAT</i> IS ALL
IN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES.

339
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,300
WOW.

340
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,400
YEAH, THAT'S HOW
THIS LADY ROLLS.
(telephone rings)

341
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,900
HANG ON.
WILHELMINA SLATER'S OFFICE.

342
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,900
OH, MY GOD.

343
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,500
IT'S COMING UP NOW?

344
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,000
THE CONTRACT RIDER
FOR SHAKIRA'S PHOTO SHOOT

345
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,400
IS ARRIVING AS WE SPEAK.

346
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,500
IN IT IS A LIST
OF EVERYTHING SHE NEEDS

347
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,900
FOR HER DRESSING ROOM.

348
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,500
AMBITIOUS SUCK-UPS!

349
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,800
I MEAN... INTERNS!

350
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,400
WRITE THIS DOWN.
EVERYTHING.

351
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,900
I'M DOING OKAY, <i>PAPI.</i>

352
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,500
I JUST--I MISS HIM SO MUCH.

353
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,600
I know, <i>Mija,</i>

354
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,100
BUT IT'LL GET BETTER.

355
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,800
????

356
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,300
YEAH. AT LEAST
I HAVE HIS THINGS.

357
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,200
WHAT THINGS?

358
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,200
I WENT AND I CLEANED OUT
HIS APARTMENT.

359
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,600
A LOT OF HIS STUFF LOOKS
REALLY GOOD IN OUR PLACE.

360
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,800
REALLY? I DON'T REMEMBER SANTOS
HAVING SUCH GOOD TASTE.

361
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,600
You're crazy.

362
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,600
HE HAD SUCH AN EYE.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

363
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,100
Sweetheart, um,

364
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,500
I know everything
holds a memory for you now,

365
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,800
BUT ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT
GETTING A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY?

366
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,700
When your mother died,

367
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,300
I couldn't let go
of any of her things--

368
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,300
HER CLOTHES, HER KEY CHAIN.

369
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,200
I EVEN FOUND
AN OLD RESTAURANT CHECK

370
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,000
FROM PIETRO'S IN BAYSIDE.

371
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,400
IT WAS FROM THE NIGHT
WE GOT ENGAGED.

372
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,100
YOUR MOTHER HAD SAVED IT
ALL THOSE YEARS,

373
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,500
AND WHEN I SAW IT, I...

374
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,400
I REALIZED I DIDN'T NEED
ALL HER THINGS.

375
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,100
I HAD HER HEART.

376
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,400
SO I KEPT THE CHECK...

377
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,800
AND GOT RID
OF EVERYTHING ELSE.

378
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,900
BUT WHERE IS IT?
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

379
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,200
I'M LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW.

380
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,700
I REALLY MISS YOU, <i>PAPI.</i>

381
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,700
I MISS U TOO.

382
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
(telephone beeps)
HEY, ????

383
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,400
SORRY I'M LATE, MAMA.
I'LL GET THE ENCHILADAS STARTED.

384
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,800
MIRTA'S NOT HERE.

385
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,800
THANK GOD. ENOUGH WITH
THE BEANS AND CHEESE.

386
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,900
YOU WANNA ORDER CHINESE?

387
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,000
BEANS, CHINESE?

388
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,600
(speaks Spanish)

389
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,800
ARE YOU OKAY?

390
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,500
I WAS JUST TALKING TO HILDA.

391
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,100
YOU GET LIKE THIS
EVERY TIME YOU CALL.

392
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,700
YOUR VISA WILL COME THROUGH.
YOU'LL BE HOME SOON.

393
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,800
I'M SO TIRED OF HEARING THAT!

394
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,900
I DON'T WANT
TO WAIT ANY LONGER, CLARA!

395
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
MY DAUGHTER BURIED
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE,

396
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,500
AND I COULDN'T BE THERE
TO HOLD HER.

397
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,400
MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST GET THERE ON MY OWN.

398
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,800
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
FORGET THE VISA.

399
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,200
I'LL JUST GET ACROSS THE BORDER
ANOTHER WAY.

400
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,100
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

401
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,400
I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.

402
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
TREAT ME LIKE A CRIMINAL,
I'LL BE ONE.

403
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,700
I WANNA GO HOME.

404
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,100
WELL, THEN...

405
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,500
IF YOU THINK
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY,

406
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,300
I MIGHT KNOW SOMEONE
WHO CAN HELP YOU.

407
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
DWAYNE, PLEASE HURRY.

408
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,600
I SMELL A BURRITO.

409
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,900
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

410
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,300
A.J., YOU WERE ASSIGNED
NUMBER SIX ON SHAKIRA'S RIDER.

411
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,600
READ THAT TO ME.

412
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,700
"ONE BOX OF BENDY STRAWS"?

413
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,900
UH-HUH. BENDY STRAWS!

414
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,900
NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT WHAT YOU BROUGHT BACK.

415
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,400
OKAY, SO I'M SHAKIRA, AND I
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A DRINK,

416
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,900
SO I TAKE A STRAW,
AND I PUT IT IN MY CUP.

417
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,900
A--OH, BUT WHAT'S THIS?

418
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,800
IT DOESN'T BEND?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

419
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,100
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DRINK?
LIKE--LIKE THIS?

420
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,800
THIS ISN'T COMFORTABLE.
I CAN'T DRINK LIKE THIS.

421
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,900
AM I SOME KIND OF ANIMAL? NO.
 <i>YO SOY</i> SHAKIRA!

422
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,000
AND I WILL NOT BE HOLDING
MY DRINK DOWN AROUND MY CHIN

423
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,600
LIKE SOME SAVAGE
IF I'M THIRSTY!

424
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,800
NOW THIS STRAW DEBACLE
IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

425
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,300
ONLY ONE OF OF YOU--
 <i>ONE--</i>

426
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,200
GOT HIS LIST CORRECT.

427
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,600
JUSTIN.

428
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,500
THE REST OF YOU CAN LEAVE.

429
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,400
JUSTIN, YOU ARE
IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING.

430
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,400
AWESOME.

431
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,500
GO.

432
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,900
I HAVE A TASK FOR YOU.

433
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,500
HMM?

434
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,400
I NEED DIRT
ON BETTY SUAREZ.

435
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,800
I'M HEARING YOU LOUD AND CLEAR,
WILHE-MEISTER.

436
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,900
OKAY, CHOCOLATE ALMOND MILK.

437
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,700
I THINK THAT THERE'S
A HEALTH STORE ON 59th.

438
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,600
OH, PFFT! THERE'S PLENTY
OF TIME FOR THAT.

439
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,700
I WAS JUST THINKING,

440
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,100
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT OUR FAMILIES.

441
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,300
YOU GO FIRST.

442
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,800
I'M LOOKING FOR
A PACKAGE FOR ALEXIS.

443
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,500
IRONIC, AS I SAY THAT
OUT LOUD.

444
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,900
(sniffs) OH!
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

445
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,600
I THINK
IT'S THAT DOG.

446
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,100
IT IS NOT THAT DOG.

447
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,500
IT SMELLS LIKE ASS.

448
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,100
YEAH, AND WHEN YOU'RE 84, YOU'RE
GONNA SMELL LIKE ASS, TOO.

449
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,500
LEAVE HALSTON ALONE.

450
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,000
HE WAS A GIFT TO ME
FROM MY MOTHER.

451
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I GET $1,000 A WEEK
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM,

452
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,600
WHICH MEANS $5 FOR DOG FOOD,

453
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,400
AND THE NEW BALENCIAGA BAG
FOR ME.
(wheezes)

454
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,300
(gasps)
IS HE SUPPOSED TO
TIP OVER LIKE THAT?

455
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,700
OH, MY GOD!

456
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,300
AMANDA! OH, THERE YOU ARE!
IS DANIEL IN HIS OFFICE?

457
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,300
I DON'T KNOW WHERE DANIEL IS.
I HAVE TO GO TO THE VET!

458
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,300
HANG ON, HALSTON.
DON'T QUIT ON ME.

459
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,800
WELL, IF HE WASN'T
AT THE HOSPITAL,

460
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,600
THEN WHERE COULD HE BE?

461
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,000
JUSTIN, ARE YOU DOING OKAY?

462
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,800
CAN'T TALK.
LOOKING FOR GUA JUICE.

463
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,000
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH

464
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,600
IF WILHELMINA'S
BOINKING THE BODYGUARD?

465
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,500
BECAUSE DANIEL IS LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING

466
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,900
TO INCRIMINATE WILHELMINA,
AND HE COULD USE THIS--

467
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,900
(gasps)
OH!

468
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,900
GOOD, YOU'RE BACK.
WILHELMINA WANTS TO SEE YOU.

469
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,300
OH, UM, OKAY, YEAH, GREAT.

470
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,100
I JUST HAVE SOME THINGS
THAT I NEED TO FINISH UP,

471
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,800
AND I'LL STOP BY HER OFFICE
ON THE WAY OUT.

472
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,900
NO, YOU WON'T.

473
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,700
SHE'S WAITING FOR YOU
RIGHT NOW... ON THE ROOF.

474
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,200
THE ROOF?

475
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,000
THE ROOF.

476
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,800
HELLO?

477
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,100
WILHELMINA?

478
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,000
I BELIEVE YOU LOST SOMETHING.

479
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,100
THANK YOU, MARC.
YOU CAN GO NOW.

480
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,499
YOU SURPRISE ME, BETTY.

481
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,099
STEALING MY KEYS?

482
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,100
BREAKING INTO MY APARTMENT?
TAKING THE BOOK?

483
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,299
GOOD FOR YOU.
YOU'RE... GROWING.

484
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,099
LOOK, I WAS JUST THERE
FOR THE BOOK.

485
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,200
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HEAR
ANYBODY HAVING SEX.

486
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,800
LOOK, DWAYNE AND I
ARE DEAR OLD FRIENDS.

487
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,100
THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH BRADFORD.

488
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,000
WHOM YOU LOVE, RIGHT?

489
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,699
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN A MONTH.

490
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,800
WHOM I LOVE MADLY.

491
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,500
DO WE UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER?

492
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,799
WILHELMINA,
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND

493
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,499
THAT MY LOYALTIES
ARE WITH DANIEL,

494
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,000
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR INVITING ME.

495
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,300
IT WAS VERY WONDERFUL TO SEE
THE ROOF. THANK YOU.

496
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,500
PITY ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

497
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,000
WHAT ABOUT MY FATHER?

498
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,900
OH, I KNOW
THAT HE'S STUCK IN <i>MEXICO.</i>

499
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,400
SHAME. MY FATHER
IS A UNITED STATES SENATOR.

500
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,700
HE HELPS PEOPLE GET
THEIR VISAS ALL THE TIME.

501
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,300
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

502
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,500
(scoffs) COME ON, GIRL.
I AM BLACK. YOU'RE MEXICAN.

503
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,200
LET'S NOT TALK AROUND IT LIKE
A COUPLE OF DULL WHITE PEOPLE.

504
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,400
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT
AND YOUR OLD MAN COMES HOME.

505
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
SO LIE TO DANIEL?

506
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,100
NOT LIE,
JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

507
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,800
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

508
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,200
YOU THINK ABOUT IT, BETTY,

509
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,600
AND GET BACK TO ME
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

510
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,199
NO PRESSURE.

511
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,100
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S HOLDING ALL THE CARDS.

512
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,100
HEY, BETTY.

513
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,300
WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

514
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,800
AH!

515
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,500
OW.

516
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,200
HEY.

517
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,199
STILL NOT VERY GOOD
AT THAT.
HEY, I TALKED TO DAD!

518
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,700
OH, UH, YOU OKAY?

519
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,499
OKAY? I'M GREAT!

520
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,399
IT'S JUST WONDERFUL TO KNOW

521
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,499
I HAVE SUCH A SUPPORTIVE FAMILY
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

522
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,400
SUPPORTIVE?

523
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,700
HE'S TOTALLY SUPPORTIVE
ABOUT ME BECOMING THIS...

524
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,500
WITH THESE.

525
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,000
WILL YOU STOP
GRABBING THEM FOR A SECOND?

526
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,200
DAD... SAID HE WAS OKAY
WITH ALL THIS?

527
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,900
WHAT ELSE
DID HE TELL YOU?

528
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,200
(Justin) AND I GOT
THE SEEDLESS GRAPES,

529
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,500
A TUB OF RED VINES.

530
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,100
THE ONLY THING I COULDN'T FIND
WAS THE SCULLY FOODS

531
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,700
100% ORGANIC, ALL-NATURAL
SOY RICE CAKES.

532
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,800
AH, THE RICE CAKE--

533
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,700
THE SCOURGE OF MANY
A CELEBRITY ASSISTANT.

534
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,500
NEED I MENTION THE '88 MADONNA
"SPEED THE PLOW" TANTRUM?

535
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,300
DON'T SWEAT IT.

536
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,800
YOU STILL HAVE 12 MORE HOURS

537
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,300
BEFORE YOU NEED TO BRING THEM
TO THE SHAKIRA SHOOT.

538
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,600
OH... MY... GOD.

539
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,000
I AM GOING TO
THE SHAKIRA PHOTO SHOOT?
YEP.

540
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,600
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
THESE LIPS DON'T LIE.

541
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
THIS IS AMAZING!

542
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,800
I CANNOT WAIT TO TELL MY...

543
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,400
YOU OKAY?

544
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,399
YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW.

545
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
HEY, JUSTIN.

546
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,000
IT'S OKAY.

547
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,099
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT WITH YOUR DAD

548
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,800
AND EVERYTHING, BUT...

549
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,000
IT'S OKAY TO BE HAPPY.

550
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,800
U DID
A GOOD JOB TODAY.

551
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,700
ENJOY IT.

552
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,100
HI.
HI.

553
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,600
I JUST MADE A LITTLE PERSON
FEEL BETTER ABOUT HIS DAY.

554
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,700
I'M A GOOD PERSON.
NO, I'M A GREAT PERSON.

555
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,600
DOES YOUR RAT
HAVE A STRONG SMELL?

556
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,199
HALSTON IS SICK, OKAY?
I JUST TALKED TO THE VET.

557
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
HE NEEDS OINTMENTS
AND PATCHES AND PILLS.

558
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,599
OH, MY.
SUDDENLY I AM A CAREGIVER.

559
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,699
ME.
THAT IS SO NOT WHO I AM.

560
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,200
'TIS TRUE. YOU ARE A BIT OF
A MONSTER ON THE INSIDE.

561
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,600
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

562
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,000
IT'S ALMOST LIKE I'D BE
BETTER OFF GETTING RID OF HIM.

563
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,000
HOW COULD YOU?

564
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,400
DAMN IT.

565
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,700
HOW COULD YOU LIE
TO ALEXIS LIKE THAT?

566
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,200
DID I? I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID.

567
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,000
WELL, LET'S START WITH HOW
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER

568
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
YOU'D REJECT HER
IF SHE GOT A SEX CHANGE.

569
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,399
I THINK YOUR EXACT WORDS WERE,
"YOU'D BE DEAD TO ME."

570
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,300
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL HER
ABOUT WILHELMINA.

571
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,800
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN A MONTH, DAD.

572
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,800
YOU'RE RIGHT, DANIEL.
I DIDN'T.

573
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,700
I SAW ALEXIS
LYING IN THAT BED

574
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,600
AND REALIZED I ALMOST LOST
MY CHILD... AGAIN.

575
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,699
THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US TO START
A WHOLE NEW RELATIONSHIP.

576
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,999
NO WAY. YOU ARE NOT SCREWING
WITH HER HEAD LIKE THIS.

577
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,700
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL HER
THE TRUTH, I AM.

578
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,300
DANIEL... YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

579
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,899
TO HAVE A CHANCE
TO REWRITE THE PAST.

580
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,700
I NEED TO FIX
THE MISTAKES I MADE.

581
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,600
 <i>(Ignacio) MIJA?</i>

582
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,800
DAD?

583
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,699
 <i>YOU ALL RIGHT?</i>

584
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,900
DAD, HELME!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

585
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,200
 <i>YEAH,</i>
 <i>IT'S AOUGH DECISION.</i>

586
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,300
 <i>LET ME TELL YOU</i>
 <i>WHAT TO DO.</i>

587
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,300
 <i>KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND GET</i>
 <i>MY ASS HOME FROM MEXICO.</i>

588
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,400
BUT DANIEL'S MY BOSS.

589
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,300
 <i>OH, YEAH? WELL, DID YOUR BOSS</i>
 <i>BRING YOU HOME</i>

590
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,299
 <i>IN A LITTLE BLANKIE</i>
 <i>FROM THE HOSPITAL?</i>

591
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,000
 <i>DID YOUR BOSS TEACH YOU</i>
 <i>HOW TO SWIM?</i>

592
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,200
 <i>DID YOUR BOSS</i>
 <i>PULL YOU OFF THE TRACKS</i>

593
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
 <i>SECONDS BEFORE A SUBWAY CAR</i>
 <i>WAS ABOUT TO CRUSH YOU?</i>

594
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,900
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU DID THAT.
 <i>I DIDN'T,</i>

595
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,400
 <i>THE FIRST TWO THINGS</i>
 <i>WEREN'T IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH.</i>

596
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,599
 <i>FAMILY, BETTY. WHAT'S MORE</i>
 <i>IMPORTANT THAN FAMILY?</i>

597
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,999
I KNOW, <i>PAPI,</i> I KNOW.
IT'S JUST...

598
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,300
IT'S SO WRONG,

599
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,100
AND WE SHOULD JUST
TRUST THE SYSTEM, RIGHT?

600
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,100
I MEAN, YOU'LL GET
YOUR VISA ON YOUR OWN.

601
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,100
AND ISN'T IT MORE IMPORTANT
FOR ME TO TELL THE TRUTH

602
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,000
 <i>I HATE IT</i>
 <i>THAT I RAISED YOU RIGHT.</i>

603
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,300
OOH, THOSE SMELL GOOD.

604
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,500
CAN I HAVE SOME?

605
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,300
 <i>YOU'RE HELPING DANIEL.</i>

606
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,300
 <i>GET</i> DANIEL <i>TO MAKE YOU</i>
 <i>ENCHILADAS!</i>

607
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,200
HEY, CHRISTINA,
I WAS WONDERING...

608
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,600
DID YOU KNOW IF,
FOR SOME REASON,

609
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,800
BETTY MIGHT BE
MAD AT ME?

610
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,800
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

611
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,100
I MEAN, YOU DID LEAD HER ON,
THEN RACE OFF TO TUCSON,

612
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,800
THEN AFTER A FEW WEEKS,

613
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,400
ONCE SHE WAS STARTING
TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER,

614
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,700
SUDDENLY POP BACK INTO
HER LIFE AGAIN.

615
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,099
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.
OH, HENRY.

616
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,700
SHE'S NOT MAD, SHE'S JUST
A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED.

617
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,399
WELL, I'M CONFUSED, TOO.

618
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,800
I MEAN, I KNOW I HAVE
THIS OBLIGATION TO CHARLIE

619
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,800
AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO BE A DAD, BUT...

620
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,700
I JUST... I REALLY MISS
WHAT BETTY AND I HAD.

621
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,900
HENRY, SHE'S MAKING
AN UMPTY OUT OF YOU.
AN UMPTY?

622
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,100
JACKASS.
BETTY?

623
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,700
CHARLIE!
HOW?

624
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,100
(sighs) MM, HENRY...

625
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
COME HERE.

626
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,300
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS BABY OF YOURS,

627
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,700
'CAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOT TO.

628
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,800
OKAY, HALSTON,
THIS IS YOUR NEW HOME!

629
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,700
ISN'T IT PRETTY?
IT'S SO PRETTY.

630
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,999
SO PRETTY.

631
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,600
CAN I HELP YOU?

632
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,800
HI, I'M LOOKING FOR A NICE NEW
HOME FOR MY SWEET LITTLE DOGGY.

633
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,100
YEAH, WE'LL TAKE IT.
SIGN THIS FORM.

634
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,100
SO IS THERE, LIKE,
A BIG GRASSY AREA IN THE BACK

635
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,400
WHERE THE DOGGIES
CAN RUN AROUND?
SURE, WITH PEANUT BUTTER

636
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,900
AND A POOL SHAPED LIKE
A DOG BONE.

637
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,800
AH!
REALLY?

638
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,400
NO.

639
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,100
HEY, UH, CAN I
AT LEAST SAY GOOD-BYE?

640
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:57,000
OKAY, HALSTON, I'M SURE
SOMEONE WILL ADOPT YOU.

641
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,200
(snorts) I DON'T KNOW.
THAT IS ONE UGLY DOG.

642
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,000
POT, KETTLE, BLACK.

643
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,600
(Amanda) DO YOU MIND?

644
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,000
THIS DOG BELONGED TO MY MOTHER.

645
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,700
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

646
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,300
DOES YOUR MOTHER KNOW
YOU'RE DOING THIS?

647
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,400
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING DOWN
THAT ROAD AGAIN.

648
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:15,100
MY MOTHER IS GONE,
AND THIS WAS HER DOG.

649
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,100
AND SHE ONCE HELD HIM
JUST LIKE I AM HOLDING HIM NOW.

650
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,099
MM.

651
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,500
YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT HER
THAN I WILL EVER KNOW.

652
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,599
AND SO WHAT IF YOU'RE MANGY
AND DISGUSTING

653
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,400
WITH A WEIRD RASH
ON YOUR BUTT?

654
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,299
ORAYBE THAT IS YOUR BUTT?

655
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,200
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY CONNECTION
I'LL EVER HAVE TO MY MOTHER.

656
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,600
BACK OFF, CUJO.
I'M TAKING HIM HOME.

657
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,000
HUNGRY?
MM!

658
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,800
I BROUGHT YOU
BARROW STREET BURGERS.

659
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,500
YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER,
BUT YOU ALWAYS LIKED IT.

660
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,900
HEY, I'M NOT PICKY.

661
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,300
UP TILL YESTERDAY
I WAS EATING OUT OF A TUBE.

662
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,100
MMM! THESE ARE GOOD.

663
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,400
SO, UM...

664
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,699
I KINDA WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT... DAD.

665
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,600
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINNG
A LOT ABOUT HIM TODAY, AND YOU.

666
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,100
WAKING UP IN THIS BED,

667
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,800
THINKING I WAS ALEX,
I FELT ALONE.

668
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,100
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THE THING THAT MADE IT OKAY

669
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,300
WAS KNOWING THAT YOU AND DAD
ARE REALLY THERE FOR ME.

670
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,100
YEAH.

671
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,399
YEAH, WE WERE...
HERE FOR YOU.

672
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,800
SO LISTEN,
I HAVEN'T ASKED YOU YET.

673
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,800
HOW DID WE EVEN GET INTO
THIS ACCIDENT?

674
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,600
UM... WELL...

675
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,100
OH, GOD, DANIEL,
WHAT ARE YOU NOT TELLING ME?

676
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,599
WAS IT MY FAULT?
NO!

677
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,700
WAS I DRUNK?
NO, NO, NO, NO,
YOU--YOU WERE FINE.

678
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,200
UH, IT WAS JUST, UH...

679
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,500
A DEER.

680
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,300
IT--IT LEAPT OUT
IN FRONT OF THE CAR,

681
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,900
YOU SWERVED...
AND THAT WAS IT.

682
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,800
WOW.

683
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,000
WELL, AT LEAST
I SAVED A DEER.

684
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,799
DAD!

685
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,099
SO... HOW ARE WE?

686
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,199
WE'RE GREAT.

687
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,700
I WAS JUST TELLING DANIEL
I FEEL SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU TWO

688
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,200
AS MY FAMILY.

689
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,100
RICE CAKES!

690
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,200
ALL RIGHT, UH...
ANYTHING ELSE?

691
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,600
NOPE. THAT'S IT.

692
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,900
JUSTIN SUAREZ, RIGHT?

693
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,900
YEAH.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

694
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,100
I WAS AT
YOUR FATHER'S FUNERAL.

695
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,100
YOU KNOW, HE SAVED MY LIFE,
RIGHT HERE IN THIS STORE.

696
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,700
YOUR FATHER WAS A HERO.

697
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,000
I DIDN'T KNOW
THIS WAS WHERE...
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

698
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,600
YOU SHOULD KNOW,
HE WAS A REALLY GOOD MAN.

699
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,800
I BET YOU'RE
JUST LIKE HIM.

700
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,400
NO... I'M NOT.

701
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,900
THANKS, BETTY.

702
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,800
DANIEL, WAIT.

703
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,800
I NEED TO TELLOU
SOMETHING.

704
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,700
OH, UM... IT'S MY DAD.

705
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,700
CAN I TALK TO YOU IN A MINUTE?

706
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,900
YEAH.
(ring)

707
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,500
HELLO?
BETTY?

708
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,700
DAD?
I'M COMING HOME.

709
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,700
WHAT?
DID YOUR VISA COME THROUGH?
NO.

710
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:03,100
I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE.
THIS COULD TAKE MONTHS, A YEAR.

711
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,500
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? DAD, NO.

712
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,400
IF YOU GET CAUGHT, THEY'RE NOT
GONNA LET YOU BACK IN,

713
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,500
AND YOU KNOW HOW THEY PACK
THOSTRUCKS WITH PEOPLE.

714
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,499
YOU COULD DIE.
IT'S MY LIFE, BETTY.
THIS IS MY DECISION.

715
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,299
NO, THESE ARE OUR LIVES, DAD--

716
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,099
YOURS AND MINE
AND HILDA'S AND JUSTIN.

717
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,400
 <i>MIJA,</i> I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.
I LEAVE TOMORROW NIGHT.

718
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,100
DAD, PLEASE,
JUST DON'T DO ANYTHING YET.

719
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,199
I KNOW HOW TO GET YOU HOME.

720
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,500
Let me talk to the lawyer
one last time.

721
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,500
4:58.

722
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,800
YOU DO LIKE
TO CUT IT CLOSE.

723
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,700
OH, AND THE PICTURES
THAT SANTOS

724
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,800
TOOK OF HIMSELF AT THE GYM
DO NOT NEED TO BE FRAMED.

725
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,900
OKAY, SO I'M KEEPING
ONE THING.

726
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,000
YOU SHOULD
KEEP SOMETHING, TOO.

727
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
JUST LOOK THROUGH
ALL THE STUFF

728
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,399
AND FIND SOMETHING
THAT YOU REALLY LOVE, OKAY?

729
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,800
OKAY.
OKAY.

730
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,600
OKAY.

731
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,499
LOOK, I NEVER SIGNED OFF
ON BRIGITTE LACOMBE.

732
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,599
I THOUGHT WE AGREED IF
WE COULDN'T GET MARIO TESTINO,

733
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,500
WE WOULDN'T DO THE SPREAD.

734
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,300
I STILL LIKE
THE DAVID LaCHAPPELLE

735
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,100
CHATEAU MARMONT PHOTOS
WE COULDN'T RUN LAST MONTH.

736
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,300
YOU'RE RIGHT.

737
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,899
YOU'RE BACK,
AND YOU ARE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.

738
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,800
I MADE A MISTAKE.

739
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,000
IS THAT ALL?

740
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,500
UH, YES... THAT IS ALL.

741
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,300
OH, BETTY, I HEARD YOUR FATHER'S
COMING BACK ON THURSDAY.

742
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,100
PLEASE GIVE HIM
MY REGARDS.

743
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,800
WOW.

744
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,500
THAT WENT SO MUCH BETTER
THAN I EXPECTED.

745
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,900
BETTY, I CAN'T THANK YOU
ENOUGH.

746
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,000
IF YOU HADN'T
GOTTEN THE BOOK,

747
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,800
SHE WOULD'VE DONE
EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED.

748
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
OH, I'M JUST DOING
MY JOB, DANIEL.

749
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,700
NO, I MEAN,
WHEN EVERYTHING'S ON THE LINE,

750
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,099
YOU'RE THE ONE PERSON HERE

751
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,400
I CAN TRULY TRUST.

752
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,200
YEAH.

753
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,800
SWEETHEART?

754
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,900
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH CAVALLI'S PEOPLE.

755
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,800
HE IS DESIGNING YOU
A CHARCOAL GRAY,

756
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,500
SINGLE BUTTON TUXEDO
FOR THE WEDDING.

757
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,700
AND HE'S FLYING HIMSELF IN
FOR THE FITTING.

758
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,400
LISTEN, DARLING, WITH ALEXIS
STILL IN THE HOSPITAL,

759
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,800
I'M NOT SURE
A GIANPARTY

760
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE
RIGHT NOW.

761
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,300
WELL, YOU WANT ME TO CUT DOWN
THE SIZE OF THE WEDDING?

762
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,900
I WANT TO POSTPONE
THE WEDDING.

763
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,700
BECAUSE OF ALEXIS?

764
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,000
I SPENT THE AFTERNOON WITH HER.
WE'RE STARTING TO BOND AGAIN.

765
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,700
WELL...

766
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,400
ISN'T THAT, UH, WONDERFUL?

767
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,900
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.

768
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,000
ALEXIS IS STILL COMING
TO TERMS WITH THE FACT

769
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,999
THAT HER MOTHER AND I
ARE NO LONGER TOGETHER.

770
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'M AFRAID IT MIGHT BE
A BIT MUCH FOR HER TO HEAR

771
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,900
THAT I'M MARRYING
SOMEONE ELSE.

772
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,399
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD HER
ABOUT ME?

773
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
I WILL,
WHEN SHE'S READY.

774
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,500
YOU STILL LOVE ME?

775
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,400
ALWAYS.

776
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,299
UH, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

777
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,200
I HAVE TO GO CALL CAVALLI
AND HAVE HIM POSTPONE HIS TRIP.

778
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,300
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

779
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,500
I'M FINE.

780
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,199
AAH!

781
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,100
AAH! AAH!

782
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,300
AAH!

783
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,900
(Hilda) BETTY?

784
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,100
BETTY! (laughs)
 <i>PAPI</i> JUST CALLED!

785
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,700
HE GOT HIS VISA!
HE'S GONNA BE HOME ON THURSDAY!

786
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,699
WOW! COOL.
THAT'S--I'M SO HAPPY.

787
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,800
YEAH?
WELL, TELL YOUR FACE.

788
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,899
COME ON!
WE GOTTA PLAN A BIG PARTY!

789
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,400
I KNEW IT WAS GONNA
WORK OUT.

790
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
OH, I JUST KNEW IT!

791
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,600
SO YOU GOT RID OF
SANTOS' THINGS?

792
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,100
ARE YOU OKAY?

793
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,600
YEAH, I'M OKAY.

794
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,199
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO LIVE WITH THAT.

795
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,999
WOW. I LIKE IT.

796
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,500
STRIKE.

797
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,300
(laughs) I GOTTA GO PLAN
THE MENU.

798
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,800
OOH, DO YOU THINK IT'S WRONG
IF WE ASK <i>PAPI</i> TO COOK?

799
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
EH.

800
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,600
HELLO.

801
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,500
IGNACIO SUAREZ?

802
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,900
YES, CAN I HELP YOU?

803
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,000
YOU JUST DID.

804
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,000
(man) HELLO?!

805
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,500
WHO IS IT?

806
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,800
(Henry) IT'S ME.

807
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,599
HENRY?

808
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,000
BETTY?

809
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,700
CHRISTINA TOLD ME
ABOUT CHARLIE,

810
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,000
THAT SHE CHEATED ON ME.

811
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,000
THE BABY
MIGHT NOT BE MINE.

812
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,500
OH, GOD, HENRY.

813
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,100
YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING.

814
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,700
YES, I HAVE.

815
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,500
BUT...
I DRANK MILK FIRST TO...

816
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,500
COAT MY STOMACH.

817
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,900
BETTY...

818
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,800
CHARLIE WAS THE ONLY REASON
WE COULDN'T BE TOGETHER.

819
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,600
AND SHE'S NOT A REASON ANYMORE.

820
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,100
I WANNA BE WITH YOU, BETTY.

821
