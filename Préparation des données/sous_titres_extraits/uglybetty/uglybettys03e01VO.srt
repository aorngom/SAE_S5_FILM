1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:02,106
Last season on "ugly betty"...

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,220
he says his name is daniel.

3
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:04,930
You are his father.

4
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,838
She has
a crush on my gym teacher.

5
00:00:06,838 --> 00:00:09,124
You're telling me that you're
married? I just wanted you to know

6
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:10,982
Because i feel like i'm falling for you

7
00:00:10,982 --> 00:00:12,977
. Oh,
why did i agree to have wilhelmina's baby?

8
00:00:12,977 --> 00:00:15,040
Christina,
you didn't have a choice.

9
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,686
I'm going to start
a magazine.

10
00:00:17,736 --> 00:00:20,046
I'm going to call it
"hot flash."

11
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:22,224
You're no longer editor-In-Chief of
"mode."

12
00:00:22,324 --> 00:00:24,513
I am. How could you do this to me?

13
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:26,136
We'll find something else
for you to do,

14
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:28,900
But "mode" just isn't it.
Come to rome with me.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,238
Yes! What?
Will you marry me, betty?

16
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:39,790
I had a choice
to make between two guys,

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,800
And i was torn.

18
00:00:42,274 --> 00:00:44,608
And then it hit me, literally.

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,107
A softball hit me.

20
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:49,608
I'm sorry.
You're so special to me.

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,673
And as much as i love you, i'm
just not ready to marry you.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,608
I know how much
you care about me,

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,773
And i care about you, too,

24
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:04,113
But not in that way,
and i feel like

25
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:07,300
If i go to rome with you, i'm
just gonna be leading you on.

26
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,800
There's just so much
that i want to experience

27
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,441
Before i settle
into a relationship,

28
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:16,374
For my life, my career.

29
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:18,574
Mom...

30
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:20,331
you never got the chance

31
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:23,074
To find out
who you were without us.

32
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:26,773
You sacrificed everything
so we would be happy.

33
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:29,374
So i have to take
this opportunity...

34
00:01:29,407 --> 00:01:33,253
and find out who i am...

35
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,074
by myself.

36
00:01:38,874 --> 00:01:40,862
I don't know
what i'm gonna find,

37
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:46,050
But i know where i can start-

38
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,987
The place
you always dreamt of going.

39
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:55,040
I miss you.

40
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:01,175
Wish me luck.

41
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:04,097
* i hear a wind

42
00:02:04,097 --> 00:02:08,175
* whistling air

43
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:11,231
* whispering

44
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:15,097
* in my ear

45
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:21,131
* boy mercury

46
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:25,231
* shootin' through
every degree *

47
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:32,197
* oh, girl, dancin' down
those dirty and dusty trails *

48
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:35,797
* roam if you want to

49
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,398
* roam around the world

50
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:42,930
* roam if you want to

51
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:46,431
* without anything
but the love we feel *

52
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:49,956
And this is me and peg eating
clam chowder in san francisco.

53
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:52,253
That's a woman?
Yes, she's a woman.

54
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:54,394
Peg and the girls were
bike riding cross-Country.

55
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:55,862
They were so inspiring.

56
00:02:55,895 --> 00:02:58,175
All of these women
had survived illnesses.

57
00:02:58,175 --> 00:02:59,691
I can't wait
to get back to "mode"

58
00:02:59,691 --> 00:03:03,999
And pitch their stories,
along with a lot of other ideas.

59
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:07,665
This is my idea binder. I
started it when i was on my trip

60
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:10,550
Because i have a lot to say
and a lot that i want to do,

61
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,800
And i feel so empowered. Is that why you
have this weird blue thing around your neck?

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,534
Well, yes, this "weird blue
thing" is my power animal.

63
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:18,612
It's a dove.

64
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:23,675
It represents the feminine energies of peace
and maturity. Oh, did peg give you that?

65
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:25,550
No.
She said "feminine energy."

66
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,378
Okay, okay. The whole point is
that i came back with a plan,

67
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:32,987
And i want dad to hear this.
Where is he? Dad! Right here.

68
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:36,133
Welcome to flushing burgers.
May i take your order?

69
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:37,967
You got a job?

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,967
Welcome home, mija.
How was your trip?

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,733
Don't change the subject. When did
you get a job? Hey, you inspired me.

72
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,925
When you made that big decision
to go on this trip, i thought,

73
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:48,237
Maybe i should start cooking

74
00:03:48,237 --> 00:03:50,691
Somewhere other than this
kitchen. I'm so proud of you.

75
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:53,999
It sure feels good to be back in
the workforce. And i like the cap.

76
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,113
Yeah. It's...

77
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,733
sparkly.

78
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:01,831
Justin. I was trying to
put the you in uniform.

79
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:04,113
You're gonna get me in
trouble. Now fix it. No.

80
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:07,600
Are you kidding me, papi? I think
it's sparkly, and it's got your name...

81
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:10,466
Don't be on his side.
Just put it back... guys!

82
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:11,863
I have created
a plan for myself,

83
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:13,379
And i'm very eager
to share it with you,

84
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,738
So fasten your seat belts.

85
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:17,704
Number one-I am going to take
on more responsibility at work

86
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:21,999
So that within a year,
i get a promotion. Yay!

87
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,300
Number two-
I am not going to let

88
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,600
Any romantic entanglements
get in my way.

89
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,734
And then finally,
number three-

90
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:33,300
I'm getting my own
apartment in the city. Whoo!

91
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,363
Dad, slow down. Come on.

92
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:43,363
Dad, say something, please.

93
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:45,831
Mija, how can you afford
an apartment in manhattan?

94
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:48,800
I've been saving up, and-And-
And i'm really good with money.

95
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,565
I know it's not gonna be cheap,
but i can do it.

96
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:55,378
I don't think you're ready. I am ready,
dad, and this trip has helped me grow up.

97
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,816
Look, betty, life isn't easy.
You know that.

98
00:04:57,816 --> 00:05:00,050
But you don't really know
until you start experiencing it.

99
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,997
Yes! Experiencing things-
That's the whole point. You see?

100
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:06,300
Look, you come back with
all this talk about change

101
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,800
And growing up,
and it just makes you sound...

102
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:12,050
what?
It makes me sound what?

103
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:14,785
Well...

104
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:16,425
a little naive.

105
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:18,050
Naive?

106
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,362
Yeah.

107
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:21,838
Well, i'm glad
i have your support.

108
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,050
Betty...

109
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:33,050
...between 37, 38.

110
00:05:33,988 --> 00:05:35,870
Morning, kim.

111
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:36,706
That's your daughter?

112
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:39,550
The one that works at "mode"
and went on that big trip?

113
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,137
Yeah. Betty.
And now she's even planning

114
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,987
On getting an apartment
in the city.

115
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:47,204
Okay, jose.
We don't get paid to chitchat.

116
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:48,956
Corporate's been all up
in my grill about hygiene.

117
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:52,925
So get your gloves on and clean those nasty
toilets. But i-I thought i was on fryer today.

118
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:55,987
Change of plan.
Urinal cakes in the back.

119
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:04,928
Okay, "mode,"
get ready for betty.

120
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:18,999
Thank you for calling
the new "mode" magazine.

121
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:20,999
How may i direct your call?

122
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:22,847
Please hold.

123
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,300
Welcome
to the new "mode" magazine.

124
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,331
How may i direct your call?
Amanda.

125
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:31,112
Oh... my... god.

126
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:32,378
Oh, my god!

127
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:33,613
Oh, betty!

128
00:06:33,613 --> 00:06:36,628
Oh, i forgot how big
and bright you are.

129
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:37,675
What are you doing here?

130
00:06:37,675 --> 00:06:41,237
I work here.
My god, it's freezing.

131
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:44,769
She likes it that way.
It keeps everyone sharp.

132
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:48,202
She? Mandy, i'm looking out for
you, but you gotta look busy,

133
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:50,347
Even if you're doing nothing,
which is one of your strengths.

134
00:06:50,347 --> 00:06:52,735
But-
Hey, betty. Betty!

135
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:54,735
Oh, my god. Is it real?

136
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:57,112
Am i hallucinating?
Marc, stop touching me.

137
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:59,302
It is real. Betty!
Aah!

138
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,565
Oh!
Betty!

139
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:03,402
Like a long lost teddy bear.
Mm. Furry.

140
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:05,402
Why are you guys
being so nice to me?

141
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:07,050
Because you remind us
of the good old days

142
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,237
When you were here

143
00:07:07,237 --> 00:07:11,362
And you'd say something weird
or wear something hideous.

144
00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:12,987
Oh, like that thing
around your neck.

145
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:16,569
Oh, there's so many things we
could say about that. So many.

146
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,268
Well, i'm back,
so you'll have plenty of time.

147
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:23,253
Manolo blahniks,
fall 2008.

148
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:26,206
Only one person in these offices
wears those shoes.

149
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:28,569
Everyone look busy!
Aah!

150
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,702
What?

151
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:34,550
Welcome
to the new "mode" magazine.

152
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:39,675
Daniel?

153
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:02,988
No! Must i
do everything myself?

154
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:05,721
This is where
i want the window

155
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:09,254
Shining light
on my little angel.

156
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:11,754
Oh, my. It's back.

157
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:14,587
Where's daniel?
Daniel no longer works here.

158
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:17,587
What? It's been official
for almost a month now.

159
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:19,612
I'm the editor-In-Chief
of "mode,"

160
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:22,191
And this office
is now a nursery

161
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:24,300
Awaiting
the birth of my child.

162
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:27,237
Well, where's daniel?

163
00:08:28,155 --> 00:08:30,387

00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:49,940
Betty. Hey.

173
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,738
Welcome to our new home.

174
00:08:53,738 --> 00:08:56,050
* check, baby,
check, baby, one, two *

178
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:11,050
So we're working here now?

179
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,999
Yeah, alexis and wilhelmina
pushed me out.

180
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:17,175
This is where i landed. But,
daniel, isn't "player" a little...

181
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:20,362
smutty?
This is the third best-Selling

182
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:22,629
No nudity men's magazine
in the country,

183
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,768
And it's so much more
my speed.

184
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:26,612
I mean, don't i look
more relaxed?

185
00:09:26,612 --> 00:09:28,487
Totally relaxed.

186
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:31,987
Um, is that a mustache
you're growing?

187
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:33,565
It's cool, huh?

188
00:09:33,565 --> 00:09:36,999
Betty, come on. I swear
it's so much better this way.

189
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:39,999
I still own my third of meade,
but now i'm in charge of

190
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:41,831
A magazine
that actually speaks to me.

191
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,175
Look at this.
You know what it says?

192
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:45,987
Uh, beer blast?

193
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:48,691
No, it says,
"cut down on your hours.

194
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:50,628
Spend more time
with your son."

195
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:52,284
You know,
i'm starting to learn french.

196
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:57,195
D.J.'S been learning english from late night
tv. Daniel, i've been gone for almost a month.

197
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:58,910
You couldn't have called me
and told me

198
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,362
That any of this
was happening?

199
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:02,113
Oh, i did. Ginger.
Hmm?

200
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:05,690
How many messages did we leave
on betty's cell phone? A lot.

201
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,550
What number
were you calling?

202
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:13,191
This is six numbers
and the letter "p."

203
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:17,050
I'm pretty sure that's right. Well...
hey. I want you to meet the gang. Come on.

204
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,425
Everyone, let's gather around.

205
00:10:18,425 --> 00:10:20,159
There's someone
i want you to meet.

206
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:24,613
Everyone,
this is my assistant betty.

207
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,300
Why are they booing me? Oh, it's
all in fun. They boo everyone.

208
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:33,471
This your beeyotch?

209
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,925
It's okay. That's a code name
for "assistant."

210
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:38,566
So how was your trip?

211
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:41,441
Um, it was amazing.
I'm so excited to be back

212
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,550
And take some more
responsibility at work,

213
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:47,738
But i kinda thought that we
would be doing that at "mode."

214
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:49,815
Well,
you can do all that here.

215
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,691
Okay. Yeah.
Great.

216
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:56,862
Okay. Uh, daniel, wait.
What should i get started on?

217
00:10:56,862 --> 00:10:58,753
Anything you'd like.
Just have fun.

218
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:00,300
Ginger, show her
the lay of the land.

219
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,375
Mm. I was once voted
the lay of the land. Hmm.

220
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:09,488
Love your perfume, claire.

221
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:10,487
Musky.

222
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:12,425
Bite me, wilhelmina.

223
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:16,378
Alexis.

224
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,300
So i'm confused.

225
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,417
Is this the budget
for the new "mode" launch

226
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,487
Or the next harry potter film?

227
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:25,300
I know the marketing numbers
are a teensy bit high,

228
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,737
But we are pulling "mode"
out of a dark cloud.

229
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:30,726
Meaning my brother. Well, i
didn't want to say anything,

230
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,225
But this magazine
was barely scraping by

231
00:11:33,258 --> 00:11:34,792
When daniel was here.

232
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:37,816
This is our opportunity
to get the word out

233
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:39,392
That "mode" is
new and improved.

234
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:41,175
I can't do it.

235
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,692
Alexis, darling,
we need the splashy ads,

236
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:46,550
The giant billboard
in times square.

237
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,258
The giant billboard
belongs to "hot flash."

238
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,192
That sinking ship? Exactly
why it needs a billboard.

239
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:54,300
You already have
a name brand to work with.

240
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,488
"Hot flash" doesn't.

241
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:57,456
I'm sorry, wilhelmina.
I'm cutting you off.

242
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,737
W- Y-You. Wait.

243
00:12:00,737 --> 00:12:02,550
You're-You're cutting me off?

244
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,459
You're cutting me off?

245
00:12:04,492 --> 00:12:06,175
Hold it in. Hold it in.
Hold it in. Hold it in.

246
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:07,409
Think wilhelmina's
favorite things-

247
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:10,175
Macaroons, sade, karl rove.

248
00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:11,441
Hold it. Hold it. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

249
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:14,425
Out, out, out, out, out.

250
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,487
Willie, are you okay?

251
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:28,550
Say something, damn it.

252
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,050
Do you want me
to slap you? Okay.

253
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:34,659
That won't be necessary.

254
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:39,659
That sinking ship is gonna
throw us a life preserver.

255
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,659
This is the year i was supposed
to take on more, get ahead.

256
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:45,940
Daniel's
got me doing nothing.

257
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,941
So maybe "player" magazine
isn't quite what you expected,

258
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:51,050
But neither was "mode"
when you started. Yeah.

259
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,643
You made that work. I guess
you're right. Oh! There it is.

260
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:57,113
Oh, thank god for that.
I am freakin' starving.

261
00:12:57,113 --> 00:13:00,362
Although fair warning, falafel
sort of makes me a bit gassy.

262
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,628
What? I'm a pregnant woman.

263
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:05,238
I can get away with saying things
like that. Christina, we're not eating.

264
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:07,988
What? Look. The next step in my plan-

265
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,925
Get an apartment
in the city.

266
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,488
Okay, well, we didn't
even make it upstairs.

267
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:18,394
Eh, you'll see it next time.

268
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:19,956
Oh, really?
Mm-Hmm.

269
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:22,159
Your dad pulling any more
all-Day shifts this week?

270
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,331
I don't know.
Work's been kinda-

271
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:24,987
Papi!

272
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,675
That's not funny.

273
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:32,300
Sorry.

274
00:13:35,062 --> 00:13:36,800
Okay.
Maybe that's a little funny.

275
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,559
Okay.
Don't do that again.

276
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:41,058
I won't.
I promise

277
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,692
Okay, what is that?

278
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,956
Um,
that's my wife's ringtone.

279
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:57,737
Look, maybe we should...
talk about things.

280
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:58,863
Ay. No, no, no. I don't
want to talk about it.

281
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:00,550
Yeah, and where they're
going and-

282
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,753
Hilda.

283
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:06,149
I love being with you.
I do.

284
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:08,723
I- I haven't felt this way
in such a long time.

285
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:10,753
You know,
i went through something

286
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:12,789
That was really hard...
i know.

287
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:15,290
And i just-I just-
I just want to be happy.

288
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:16,878
I don't want
to think about the future.

289
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:20,123
Yeah, but the future
could be amazing between us.

290
00:14:20,156 --> 00:14:22,190
I told you how bad
things are with her.

291
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:24,363
I mean, we got married
when we were both 20.

292
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,656
We're not the same people
anymore. We both know it's over.

293
00:14:39,256 --> 00:14:40,612
Oh, my god.

294
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:42,941
It's yellow.
Yeah, it is.

295
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:45,675
It's perfect. Betty, no. You
don't want to say that too loud.

296
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:47,190
Someone else might want it.

297
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,878
Too bad about
the murder that happened

298
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:52,644
In the apartment, though, hey?
One bedroom. It's pet friendly.

299
00:14:52,644 --> 00:14:54,753
Close to all trains,
tiled bathrooms,

300
00:14:54,753 --> 00:14:57,050
Plenty of closets. Look at the price.
A bit expensive, though, isn't it?

301
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,987
Yeah, i know, but maybe i could
eat ramen twice a week

302
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:03,113
Or-Or do some more overtime.
It would be a challenge.

303
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:05,863
I'm ready for that.
That's what my trip taught me.

304
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,378
I can take any challenge
head-On and that i- Oh. Ooh.

305
00:15:09,378 --> 00:15:13,628
Oh, my god, christina.
Look. It's my power animal.

306
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:14,999
It's a pigeon.

307
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,113
It's a sign.

308
00:15:21,691 --> 00:15:23,175
I have to do this.

309
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,816
I'm meant to do this.
Christina, i have to do this.

310
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:27,894
Okay, betty. If you think
you really want to do it,

311
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,691
You've got to go straight over
to that real estate agent,

312
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:35,113
And you've got to tell her you want this apartment
right now. Okay. Yes, i will. I'll take it!

313
00:15:35,113 --> 00:15:39,675
I'll take it. What? Oh, no. No,
no. No. Excuse me. I'm sorry,

314
00:15:39,675 --> 00:15:42,363
But this apartment
is supposed to be mine.

315
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:46,300
I mean, you can't just give it away like
that, can you? Welcome to the big apple.

316
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,707
You want a place, you have to
act fast. Seriously, that fast?

317
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:52,316
It's a gut thing, honey.
I have a gut.

318
00:15:52,316 --> 00:15:54,488
I- I mean, i'm ready.
I'm ready for this.

319
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:57,456
I just-
I just need an apartment.

320
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,550
You must have some other places
that you could show me.

321
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:07,056
Well, there's something else
in this building.

322
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,253
It hasn't come
on the market yet.

323
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:10,721
Okay. Uh, is it-Is it nice?
Exactly like this one,

324
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:11,284
But a higher floor,
so even better.

325
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:15,612
Sexy views. That sounds
amazing. Can i see it?

326
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:18,519
I can't legally show it till
the agency lists it tomorrow,

327
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,425
And technically, i'm supposed
to have an open house

328
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,999
Like this one, and you saw how fast
- I'll take it!

329
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:26,300
Oh, no. I don't know. Um, are you sure? Yes, i'm
sure. My power animal is sitting in the window.

330
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,800
I'll take it. All right, signed
lease, first, last and security.

331
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,613
Okay. Can you take a check?
Congratulations.

332
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,362
My first new york city
apartment.

333
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:39,612
I have an apartment!
I have an apartment!

334
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:41,534
Yes, i know! It's great!

335
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,925
Let's go out and celebrate
with some falafel.

336
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:53,079
Are you really gonna
walk up and down

337
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,678
Five flights of stairs
every day?

338
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:57,678
Yeah. It'll just be
my exercise for the day,

339
00:16:57,712 --> 00:17:01,050
And then i don't have to go to
the gym. You don't go to the gym.

340
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,612
Then i don't have to start.

341
00:17:03,912 --> 00:17:04,566
Oh, the key.

342
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,300
Apartment 5g.

343
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:09,362
Are you ready...
uh-Huh.

344
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:14,566
To see betty suarez's
first apartment in the-Aah!

345
00:17:16,097 --> 00:17:19,738
Oh, my god.

346
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:22,331
I don't understand.

347
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:26,503
It was supposed to look exactly
like the other apartment i saw.

348
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,481
Whoa. Wait a minute. You didn't
see it before you rented it?

349
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:30,980
It was occupied.

350
00:17:31,014 --> 00:17:32,481
By a corpse?

351
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:34,281
It's okay.

352
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:37,999
It's okay. It just-
It needs a little t.L.C.

353
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,190
You know what?

354
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,781
The real estate agent said
that it had sexy views.

355
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,214
Okay.

356
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:53,247
That is not sexy...

357
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,681
or sanitary.

358
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:57,441
How much money did you put
into all of this?

359
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:01,381
Betty?

360
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,550
Everything.

361
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:05,947
My entire savings account.

362
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,881
I can't believe this!

363
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:10,548
That is the stupidest,
most irresponsible...

364
00:18:10,581 --> 00:18:12,614
you know, papi
is not making a lot,

365
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:14,363
And my salon is
not doing that great

366
00:18:14,363 --> 00:18:17,472
And with the cost of gas these
days... you don't have a car.

367
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,300
You know what i'm saying.
We are struggling as it is,

368
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,448
And you throw all your money
away on this?

369
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:25,050
I can fix this.

370
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,362
How?

371
00:18:26,362 --> 00:18:28,550
How are you gonna fix this?

372
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,300
I'm calling papi.

373
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:32,831
What? Hilda.

374
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,878
No, no, no, no, no. Don't you dare. Why?

375
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:37,425
Hilda, give me that. Just
give me the phone. Get off.

376
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:39,738
Just let me fix this
on my own.

377
00:18:43,362 --> 00:18:45,612
I mean, she never
let me see the apartment.

378
00:18:45,612 --> 00:18:47,050
That was a little tricky,
don't you think?

379
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,078
Okay, call me back.
Betty suarez, 5g. Thank you.

380
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:51,579
What's going on?

381
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:54,363
I got an apartment,
but it's a disaster.

382
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:56,988
I'm working on it. Why don't
you come in the conference room

383
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:58,237
For a minute?

384
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:04,300
I'm stuck.

385
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,613
D.J., you put the glue
on my seat. Ha ha! Very funny!

386
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:11,300
Daniel.

387
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,550
What? Come on.
He's being a kid.

388
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,425
It-It's funny. Look.
This will make you feel better.

389
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:16,753
I promise.

390
00:19:19,753 --> 00:19:22,441
Oh, come on.
You can't just boo people.

391
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:30,316
I got great news for you.

392
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:33,862
I showed uno here your
idea binder. Awesome stuff.

393
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:37,862
I really dug those victim
chicks on wheels. Wow. Really?

394
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:40,488
And it inspired
our fall cover.

395
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:41,815
Shut up.

396
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:43,863
Strong women bicycling
across the country?

397
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:47,612
Actually, it's gonna be
six hot girls on motorcycles

398
00:19:47,612 --> 00:19:51,300
T. Riding through the biggest
party towns in our country.

399
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:54,300
But that's not my idea.

400
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,332
See, uh,
we don't like disease.

401
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,200
- Boo!
- Or old women.

402
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,500
- Boo!
- Uno, they're 40.

403
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,300
Betty, there's
a perfect tie-In, okay?

404
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,100
The harley show
in brooklyn tomorrow.

405
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,800
We're gonna introduce

406
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,700
The biker chicks of "player."

407
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,600
And because it was
your original concept,

408
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,500
I think you should
head up the event.

409
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,400
Betty, you asked
for more responsibility.

410
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,900
This is gonna open up
a whole new market for us.

411
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,900
Fine. Yes. Okay.

412
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,000
I said gingham

413
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,400
And you give me
japanese floral garden kimonos?

414
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,200
More like ki-No-Nos.

415
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,800
And dragon prints, margaret?
Really? Dragon prints?

416
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,400
After all these years?

417
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,700
And thank you, rodrigo,

418
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,900
For the gift of white face
kabuki makeup.

419
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,800
You really put the gay
in geisha.

420
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,700
You should all
kill yourselves.

421
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,000
This is the most important issue
of "mode" ever, people.

422
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,600
Come back
with something fresh

423
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,600
Or don't bother
coming back at all.

424
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,500
- Now get out.
- Shame on you.

425
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,800
- Here she comes. Make the call.
- Okay.

426
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,600
What now, willie? "Mode" need
a helicopter pad on the roof?

427
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,500
Alexis, i just wanted to
apologize for our little tiff.

428
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,500
I will work with
whatever budget you see fit.

429
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,300
Regis, kelly, line one.

430
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,100
Hmm. I wonder
what that could be about.

431
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,300
Regis, kelly.

432
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,700
Oh, hello, gelman.
What is it?

433
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,800
Well, sure,
i can do the show,

434
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,000
But, uh, only if i can bring
my partner, alexis meade.

435
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,100
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Uh,
- Alexis, it's the perfect opportunity

436
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,400
To do something together
as a team.

437
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,200
Plus, we can use
the free publicity

438
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,600
With our limited resources.

439
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,800
Okay, i'll do it.

440
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,700
Gelman, we're in.

441
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,600
Oh, god,
what am i gonna wear?!

442
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,000
Like taking candy
from a tranny.

443
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,600
Yep.

444
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,400
No, i-I totally understand.
It's just-It's not fair

445
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,100
Because i didn't know that was
the apartment i was getting.

446
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,200
"L," you're on the sportster
model. Can you trade places?

447
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,100
Well, could i at least
get my money back?

448
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,100
Could you put your hair up

449
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,700
So we could see the letter
more clearly?

450
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,800
No, not you. I can't see
your hair, but you know what?

451
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,400
I'm sure it looks great.

452
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,600
Okay, look, could you just send
somebody to-To fix it up

453
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,900
Or to clean it or something?

454
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,700
Really? What time?
Yes. Okay. I'll be there.

455
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,400
- Today. Okay. Bye.
- Hey.

456
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
- Hey.
- What are you two doing here?

457
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,600
Marc wanted to see all
the girls in bikinis.

458
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,000
Actually, we heard
you were gonna be here,

459
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,100
And we just know you're gonna
do something amazingly awful

460
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,500
- And embarrassing.
- And we wanted to see
it happen. You know, for old times sake.

461
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,600
Well, i'm sorry
to disappoint you,

462
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,500
But nothing is going to happen,
so if you'll excuse me...

463
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,500
d.J.!

464
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,500
Daniel.

465
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,100
Come on. It's just silly string.
It's not broken glass.

466
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,500
- You gotta learn to laugh at yourself.
-Should he even be here?

467
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,500
Why not?
Look, i'm gonna be a cool dad.

468
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,300
- I don't want to be like my father.
- Well, you don't have to be like your father,

469
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,400
But he did come here
looking for a father,

470
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,300
- So some boundaries wouldn't hurt.
- Betty? Betty, betty, betty.

471
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,600
Major 4-1-1. Or is it 9-1-1
that's emergency?

472
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,900
I always get those confused.
Anyway, we just lost "r."

473
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,500
- What?
- The "r" girl,

474
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,900
To spell "player."

475
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
D.J. Sprayed silly string
in her eyes,

476
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,700
And she got all freaked out
and went home,

477
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,100
- And now we're a girl short.
- Okay, hogs and heifers.

478
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,600
Get ready as we launch
the "player" girls

479
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,900
- On the latest and greatest choppers.
- Okay. Uh, l-Let me think. Uh, what should we do?

480
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,400
Daniel, i'll figure this out.
It's my responsibility.

481
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,500
- You take care of d.J.
- Oh!

482
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,900
We're back now
with wilhelmina and alexis.

483
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,700
So nice to have you here.

484
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,700
It is such an honor
to be at the helm

485
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,300
As we relaunch the new
and improved "mode."

486
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,500
And wilhelmina is doing
a great job.

487
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,300
Yeah, we should mention for
the people in our audience

488
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
Who don't know,

489
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,300
Wilhelmina took over "mode" from
alexis' brother, daniel meade.

490
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,300
So what's the deal
with that?

491
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,800
What kind of show are you
running over there, alexis?

492
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,600
Uh, uh, daniel
just decided to work...

493
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,300
where his skills
would be better utilized.

494
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,800
- Tell us about this new magazine, "hot flash."
- Oh, is that what this is?

495
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,300
- I thought it was some kind of joke.
- It's my mother's pet project.

496
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,900
"Hot flash"- I just got it.
It's like menopause.

497
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
It's a magazine
about lady business.

498
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,400
I know it's real,

499
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,800
But i don't necessarily
want to read about it.

500
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,000
Oh, my god. Look at this.
"Brittle and horny-

501
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,700
Afraid your bones
will crack in the sack?"

502
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,200
Been there, done that.
Oh, yeah.

503
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,000
"P," come on.

504
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,800
"L."

505
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,700
"A."

506
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,500
"Y... "

507
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,600
All right, you can do this.

508
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,900
You can do anything.

509
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,300
You're a dove, a kick-Ass dove,

510
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,200
Just facing another challenge.

511
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,600
It's like a bike, just bigger.

512
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,700
Betty!

513
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,100
"R!"

514
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,700
- Aah!
- Look out!

515
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,300
Oh, my god! Oh!
Careful!

516
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,200
Help!

517
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,200
I'm okay.

518
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,300
Beyond my wildest dreams.

519
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,400
Magic.

520
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,900
Call 4-1-1.

521
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,300
I can't believe
they criticized

522
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,100
One of our magazines
that way.

523
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,600
I wonder whether that reaction
was just the tip of the iceberg.

524
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,900
- Have you seen the latest sales figures?
- I know, but i think it has long-Term potential,

525
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
And it's my mother's dream.

526
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,100
I had a thought,
a way of stopping the bleeding

527
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,000
And helping "mode."

528
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,700
Look, i've had
a really rough day,

529
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,000
And i'm still waiting
for that handyman.

530
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,300
A- A couple minutes?

531
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:18,100
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
I- I-I can wait. Thanks.

532
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,300
Thank you for calling.
Our offices are now closed.

533
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,100
What? No.

534
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

535
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:10,200
Aah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

536
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,600
No, stop.
You're my power animal.

537
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,600
Oh, gosh. Aah! Aah!

538
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,800
1. More responsibility at work
2. Get apartment in nyc!!!
3. No more romantic entanglements

539
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,900
Hi, hilda.

540
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,600
Hi. We got a problem.
Meet me at flushing burger,

541
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,500
And don't say a word to papi.

542
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,500
Hilda, if dad says
we shouldn't get involved,

543
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,800
Maybe we shouldn't
get involved.

544
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,500
Nuh-Uh. This manager has been
giving him crap all week

545
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,600
And then cuts his shifts.
I don't think so.

546
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,100
- And what is up with your hair? It looks
like a bird's nest.
- It's a long story.

547
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,900
Listen, if push comes to shove,
i'm ready to kick her ass.

548
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,300
- I got my big ring on.
- Hilda, there will be no ass kicking.

549
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,900
Let's just find out
what the problem is.

550
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,200
- I'm sure we can fix it.
- Okay, so once you're done with this one,

551
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,700
- You can take the old ones out and
put the new ones in.
- Oh, my god.

552
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,200
That's kimmie keegan.

553
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,500
- Get behind the human shield!
- She tortured me in high school.

554
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,800
She's pure evil.

555
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
You sure you don't want me
to kick her ass?

556
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,100
Stand by.

557
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,400
- Hello, kimmie.
- Long time no see, betty.

558
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,000
- So you're the manager here?
- Actually, it's on-Site senior executive

559
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
In charge of food operations.

560
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,300
Well, then i guess
you're exactly the person i need to talk to.

561
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,500
You see,
it seems that you have

562
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,200
Cut back
my father's hours recently.

563
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,700
Um, yeah, pretty much.
He's a slacker.

564
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,300
Um, no, he's not.

565
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,700
He's a very hardworking,
good person.

566
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,200
Oh. Then he must
just be getting old.

567
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,400
- I mean, how old is he, like, 100?
- Ooh, just say the word, betty.

568
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,500
- Take it back.
- Nope.

569
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
All right, kimmie,
don't push me.

570
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,000
I have had a very hard day,

571
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,600
And you no idea
what i am capable of.

572
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,700
Well,
i'm not a cheeseburger,

573
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,900
So i know
you're not gonna eat me.

574
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,000
- Oh, no, you didn't.
- Oh, yes, i did it.

575
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,600
And it felt good.

576
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,500
No. What are you doing? No!

577
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,600
Sorry.

578
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,100
That's it.

579
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,400
That is it.
You are going down, bitch!

580
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,900
Well, i guess if we all have
to work late,

581
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,400
We can at least enjoy a little
family dinner together, right?

582
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,500
I cannot believe the gall
of regis and kelly,

583
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,200
Spewing that garbage.

584
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,400
"Hot flash" serves a growing
and diverse demographic.

585
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,300
We need a forum

586
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,300
- To discuss aging, menopause, personal dryness.
- Uh, mom.

587
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,000
Actually, mom, there is
something about "hot flash"

588
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,900
That we need to discuss.

589
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,600
D.J., no cake. Come on.

590
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,400
- Hey. Dיjeuner first, then dessert, right?
- Je veux ma gגteau.

591
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,500
No. Come on.

592
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,100
What are you do-
Give me the...

593
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,900
hey, that is not funny.

594
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,700
Apologize to your aunt
right now.

595
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,300
No, it's fine. Chocolate
on silk-That'll come out.

596
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,100
What has gotten into you?

597
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,700
- Finish your dinner.
- Je pas faim.

598
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,400
Fine. You're not hungry?
Go do your english homework.

599
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,800
D.J., i'm not messing around.
Right now.

600
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,700
Go.

601
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,600
Now!

602
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,100
Well, isn't this
a lovely evening?

603
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,800
- Pig latin!
- Aah!

604
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,500
Dirty skank!

605
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,500
- Oh!
- The shirt! Not the shirt!

606
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,200
You mean, mean person!

607
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,300
- What is that? I don't even
- It doesn't come naturally to everyone.

608
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,300
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Enough. Enough.
- Aah!

609
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,400
You, you, get out.
She started it.

610
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,900
- It was her!
- Kpyeah, get out and tell your old man he's fired.

611
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,900
Hey, let's go.

612
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,900
How do you like me now,
ugly betty?

613
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,300
Any sign of him?

614
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,400
He locked himself in there
and won't come out.

615
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,900
I shouldn't have yelled
at him.

616
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,800
I used to hate dad
when he yelled at me.

617
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,100
I never got over it.

618
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,900
Now my own kid hates me.

619
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,100
He doesn't hate you, darling.
He's just testing you.

620
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,500
Daniel, this boy has lost
everything, his mother,

621
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,700
His home in france.
Now you can yell at him.

622
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,800
You're going to have to
sometimes,

623
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,500
But as long as he knows you're
gonna be there for him tomorrow,

624
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,000
It's okay.

625
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,300
Hello?

626
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,400
Yes, this is claire.

627
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,300
What?

628
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,400
- You killed "hot flash."
- I didn't kill it. I downsized it.

629
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,800
Mm-Hmm, and i had to find out
from an assistant at the office.

630
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,600
I was gonna tell you
at dinner,

631
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,100
- Right before the cake attack.
- Oh.

632
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,500
Look, it makes economic sense

633
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,700
To turn "hot flash" into
a quarterly or an insert.

634
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,700
- A flyer?
- An insert. Lots of magazines do this.

635
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,900
You know, you think you're
the one making these decisions,

636
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,200
But you're just doing
wilhelmina's bidding.

637
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,700
First she pushed
your brother aside,

638
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,200
Now my magazine.

639
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,900
Pretty soon, it'll be you.

640
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,800
Here you go, sweetie.

641
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,500
Mira. Hmm?

642
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,400
I'm so sorry, dad.

643
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,300
Ah, please.
There are other jobs.

644
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,000
Better jobs.

645
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,100
What happened to you today?

646
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,700
Everything. Everything
happened to me today.

647
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,800
It's like
i totally regressed.

648
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,900
Oh, mijita.

649
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,100
I acted like a child
with kimmie.

650
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,100
I got duped on this apartment.

651
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,200
It is so awful, dad. I didn't
even want to tell you.

652
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,200
And my job-Ugh!

653
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,400
It's a giant step backward.

654
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,800
Stupid power animal.

655
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,500
You were right, dad.
I was being naive.

656
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,500
I thought i grew up
on this trip,

657
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,600
But obviously, i haven't.

658
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,100
You're right.

659
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,300
Can't you see?

660
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,900
You're doing it now.

661
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,600
Growing up isn't about
making the right decisions.

662
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,500
It's about dealing with
the decisions you've made

663
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,500
And picking yourself up.

664
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,900
Ah, it's not easy,

665
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,500
But i know you, betty.

666
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,900
Te conozco.

667
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,500
You can do it.

668
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,500
And right now, these things,

669
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,100
These moments...

670
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,200
this is growing up.

671
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
What do you want?

672
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,400
I came to apologize.

673
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,300
Look, i acted like a child
yesterday. I'm sorry.

674
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,700
I guess i'm still upset over the way you treated me
in high school.

675
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,400
- You were such a bully.
- Nice apology.

676
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,000
Sorry.

677
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,000
Look, kimmie,
i know you hate me,

678
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,400
But don't take it out
on my dad.

679
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,300
He really needs this job.

680
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,400
I don't hate you.

681
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,600
I'm just jealous.

682
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,900
Wait. You're jealous of me?

683
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,500
You've got an apartment
in the city, a great job

684
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,300
And your dad's
all proud of you.

685
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,400
Me? Everything went downhill
after high school.

686
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,000
I mean, i'm working at this
dump, i still live at home,

687
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,700
I've got a boyfriend
that i kind of hate,

688
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,100
And i'm tired all the time,

689
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,100
And i looked it up
on the internet,

690
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,700
And i'm 98% sure
that i've got lyme disease.

691
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:48,000
- Whatever you do, don't have sex in
the woods on fire island.
- I won't.

692
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,100
Look, the worst part is,

693
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,300
I just feel like
nothing's ever gonna change.

694
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,400
Kimmie...

695
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,300
look,
there are so many days

696
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,600
Where i feel
exactly the same way,

697
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,700
But it gets better,

698
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,600
And it can for you, too.

699
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,200
You just have to be willing
to do something about it.

700
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,400
Take a leap. Don't be afraid
to fall flat on your face.

701
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,300
Believe me,
i do it every day.

702
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,200
Well, i've got to get this place
ready before it opens.

703
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,300
Hey, betty.

704
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,800
Tell ignacio
to be here at noon.

705
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,200
- He can have his job back?
- He's the best guy i've got on the fryer,

706
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,100
And i can't afford
to lose him.

707
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,600
Oh, thank you.

708
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,300
Thank you, kimmie.

709
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,500
Papa?

710
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,400
Hey. Uh, i was waiting
for you to come out,

711
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,700
But i guess i fell asleep.

712
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,500
I'm sorry.

713
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Listen...

714
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,200
things between us...

715
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,000
they're not always
gonna be great.

716
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,500
Pas si bon.

717
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,300
But i'm your father,

718
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,700
You are my son,

719
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,600
And we're in this together.

720
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,600
Ensemble.

721
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,600
So even
when i have to say no...

722
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,800
je t'aime beaucoup.

723
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,300
I love you, too.

724
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:00,100
Oh, taste the watermelon.

725
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,600
All right, okay.
All right, that's enough.

726
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,700
This is not funny. You guys are
acting like a bunch of idiots.

727
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,900
Actually, it's pretty funny.
And, yes, they are idiots,

728
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,100
Which is exactly why you should
put it on the "player" web site

729
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,300
- And then leak it online.
- Betty, come on.

730
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,500
No, i'm serious.
You want to get more readers?

731
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,000
Then appeal
to your demographic-

732
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,700
18- To 39-Year-Old male idiots

733
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,700
Who respond
to this type of humor.

734
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,200
Um, she's right.
We do respond to that.

735
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,000
I told you she was good.

736
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,000
Okay.

737
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,400
Okay, okay. I think
i like the booing better.

738
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,900
- Gah!
- What are you guys doing here?

739
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,900
- We figured you need some help.
- Major.

740
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,200
- Hello.
- Oh. Sorry about the
whistle, but you scared me.

741
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,000
That's so sweet.
Thank you.

742
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,100
You're welcome.

743
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,600
Oh, thank you.

744
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,100
Surprise.

745
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,300
Listen, i am really sorry

746
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,200
That i was so hard on you
the other day.

747
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,400
'Cause you're my kid sister.
I'm so proud of you.

748
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,500
You've accomplished so much,
and i just-

749
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,400
I wish i could get
my crap together like you.

750
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,400
- Hilda, you have your crap together.
- Ay.

751
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,900
You-You have the salon,
which is about to take off,

752
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
And you found
this perfect guy.

753
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,200
Oh, yeah.
He's not that perfect.

754
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,900
Really? Tell me one thing that's
not perfect about the coach.

755
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,300
See?
You can't even think of one.

756
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,500
Oh, my gosh.
What are you making me?

757
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,800
Curtains.

758
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,700
My dame's on broadway.

759
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,400
You know i'm a triple threat.

760
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Yes, an editor,
a diva and...

761
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,800
well, a threat.

762
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,300
Remind me to give kelly ripa
a gift basket.

763
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,300
She really came through
for us.

764
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,100
She's as reliable
as she is fertile.

765
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,000
Check.

766
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,300
New york city-Check.

767
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,700
"No more romantic
entanglements."

768
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,300
Hello!

769
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,500
Can we talk?

770
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,100
Hi.

771
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Um, hi.

772
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,700
I'm sorry.
Was i playing too loud?

773
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:52,100
- 'Cause i'm practicing for a gig tomorrow.
- Oh, no. I mean, a little loud,

774
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,300
But, you know,
if you're practicing,

775
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,900
Then i could just
wear earplugs or something.

776
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,200
I'm your new neighbor.
Um, 5g.

777
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,400
Oh. I'm glad you stopped by,
actually,

778
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,000
'Cause i think this might have
fallen out of your stuff.

779
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,900
Oh, my god. I didn't
even know i'd lost this.

780
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,900
- Thank you so much.
- It suits you.

781
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,100
Yeah.

782
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,800
I guess it does.

783
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,700
Okay. Thank you.

784
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,400
Sure. Oh, wait. Um, what does
the "b" stand for?

785
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,300
Oh, um, betty.

786
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,000
Betty, well, it's nice
to meet you. I'm jesse.

787
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,500
