1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,810
????

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,980
Well,That Was Relaxing.

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,420
I Didn't Mean To Hear You And Your Bodyguard Having Sex.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,000
Keep Your Mouth Shut And Your Old Man Comes Home.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,870
So Lie To Daniel? Don't Lie. Just Don't Say Anything.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,490
"I'm Your Husband." Bloody Hell.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,660
This Is My Friend. My Friend?

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,720
I Don't Think He's Your Friend. I'm His Boyfriend. Or Should I Say "Was"?

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,860
Cliff, I Really Screwed Up.

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,870
I Have Hundreds Of Backstabbing, Two-Faced,Superficial Friends

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,280
That Are Pouring In From All Over The Globe

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,240
To Be Part Of This Wedding. Any Of Them Would Be Thrilled

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,950
To Be My Maid Of Honor. You Only Have Five Months Left With Henry.

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,790
Go. The Clock Is Ticking. Maybe We Shouldn't Tell Dad.

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,540
I'm Romantic,Not Crazy.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,920
<I>Faster Than Lindsay's Alcohol Detection Bracelet,</I>

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,600
<I>But Love Has Triumphed As Wilhelmina Slater Marries</I>

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,540
<I>Publishing Magnate Bradford Meade This Saturday...</I>

19
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,550
Hey,Shouldn't You Be Getting Ready For School?

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,890
It's The Countdown To The Brad-Elmina Wedding.

21
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,710
It's A National Holiday.

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,300
I Don't Even Think There's Mail Today. Okay.

23
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,100
Betty, Breakfast Is Ready.

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,490
I Know You Haven't Had Much Of An Appetite

25
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,800
Since This Whole Mess With Henry,

26
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,020
But I Made Blueberry Pancakes.

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,200
No,Thanks.

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,180
Okay,But If You Change Your Mind...

29
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:26,800
Breakfast Is Ready.

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,920
Oh,Good. I Love Blueberry Pancakes.

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,430
How'd You Know I Was Making Blueberry Pancakes?

32
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,220
Because You Just Said So.

33
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,890
Somebody's Getting Old.

34
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,670
Canadian Bacon. Are You Having A Stroke?

35
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,630
That's The Only Thing That Got Betty's Appetite Back

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,110
After Joey Lawrence Was Kicked Off

37
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,430
That "Dancing With The Stars."

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,180
Maybe That'll Do The Trick

39
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,700
(Sighs) I Gotta Get A Life.

40
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,570
<I>Ay,Dios MO.</I>

41
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,990
<I>Mija?</I>

42
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,050
Okay,What Would You Say If I Told You

43
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,780
I Was Making Your Favorite? Canadian B--

44
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,360
Betty?

46
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,340
Dad. Hilda.

47
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,760
Oh,Man. Was I Sleepwalking?

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,610
No,They Were Supposed To Be Dyed Aspensummitwhite.

49
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,210
These Are Clearly Picket Fence White,

50
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,080
Thus Destroying...

51
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,850
The Entire Wilhelmina Slater Wedding Palette!

52
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,430
Yeah,Well,You Better Fix It By Tomorrow,

53
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,260
Or I Swear, As God As My Witness,

54
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,650
You'll Be Selling Shoelaces On The Subway!

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,900
You Are So Hot When You Go Into Head Voice.

56
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,310
(Laughs) I'm On My Last Nerve. Here,Take These.

57
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,180
The Bakery Hasn't Finished The Cake,

58
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,250
I Still Have To Finalize The Seating Chart,

59
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,900
And Wilhelmina Said If There's Baby's Breath

60
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,330
In Any Of The Floral Arrangements,

61
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,330
She's Gonna Sand Off My Nipples.

62
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,440
Wow,Cake And Nipples.

63
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,470
I Don't Know Which One To Focus On. (Laughs)

64
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,320
Okay,I'm On My Way To Graphics. By The Way,

65
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,270
You Don't Happen To Know Where My Brown Blazer Is?

66
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,970
Why? I'm Wearing It To The Wedding.

67
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,760
That Corduroy Thing That's Held Together

68
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,680
By Cat Hair And Ketchup Stains?

69
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,390
Cliff,This Wedding Is So Fancy, Armani Is Wearing Prada.

70
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,780
Come On,I Mean, Do You Really Think

71
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,570
That They're Gonna Be Looking At Me?

72
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,930
You Have Rosie O'donnell Seated At The Same Table

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
As Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

74
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,130
What? Oh,My God! How Did That Happen?

75
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,670
Okay,I've Got Too Much To Do Today.

76
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,440
If You Want To Wear That Jacket,Go Ahead.

77
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,040
Seriously, You'd Be Okay With It? Yeah,It's Who You Are,

78
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,440
And The Sooner I Accept That You're A Messy Bessy,

79
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,820
The Better Off We'll Be. Thank You.

80
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,100
And I've Told You, I Prefer Sloppy Sally. (Laughs)

81
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,240
(Bradford) Congratulations. Congratulations To You.

82
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,780
Oh,I'm Sorry. I Didn't Realize

83
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,960
We Wergetting Drunk First Thing In The Morning.

84
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,950
Little Tribute To Mom? We're Celebrating.

85
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,920
I Just Got Off The Phone With Ad Sales.

86
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,200
They Are Very Happy. Oh,I Didn't Realize You'd Heard.

87
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,610
Heard? Look At These Contracts--

88
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,130
Louis Vuitton, Cartier,Ralph Lauren...

89
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,790
Your Sister Scored Big.

90
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,480
It Looks Like She Might Have Saved The Magazine.

91
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,710
Yeah,Um,Did You See The Contract I Landed For Us?

92
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,160
Winthrop Jewelry. That Was Mine. Yeah,Here It Is.

93
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,140
They've Taken An 1/8th Of A Page In March.

94
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,170
An 1/8th Of A Page? No-- Hey,That's Great.

95
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,890
An Advertiser's An Advertiser, Right,Dad? Yes,Every Little Bit Helps.

96
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,020
You Know,Alexis, Your Dedication

97
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,890
Pleases Me More Than You'll Ever Know.

98
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,330
Now I Realize That You Have Loyalty To Your Mother,

99
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,200
But Would You Consider Standing Up With Me

100
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,700
At My Wedding Tomorrow? Really?

101
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,750
Wait A Second. I Thought I Was Your Best Man.

102
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,130
Who Threw Your Bachelor Party Last Weekend At Scores,

103
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,750
Mr. "I Need More Singles"? Ah,Cheyenne.

104
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,880
Is She Still There? Oh,She Was My Favorite.

105
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,960
<I>Does She Still Do That Thing? Oh,Yeah.</I>

106
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,240
That's Not Free,By The Way. You Know What? Forget This.

107
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,050
You Want To Make Alexis Your Best Man? Fine,Do It. Well,Why Don't You Both Do It Gether?

108
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,800
You Know What,Dad?

109
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,260
Maybe It's Better If Just Daniel Stands Up. I- No,No,No,No. Don't Worry About Me.

110
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,970
<I>He Obviously Wants You Around.</I>

111
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,830
You Really Shouldn't Disappoint Dad.

112
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,340
It Might Kill Him.

113
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,640
And You Wouldn't Want That, Would You,Alexis?

114
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,930
<I>(Man) Coverage Of The Wilhelmina Slater Wedding</I>

115
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,710
<I>Continues With Superstar Maid Of Honor</I>

116
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,170
<I>Victoria Beckham... All Right With The Posing And The Waving.</I>

117
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,900
We All Know You're Strong Enough To Raise Your Arm.

118
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,790
She'smymaid Of Honor. This Is Supposed To Be About Me.

119
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,290
<I>Pish-Tosh,It's Posh.</I>

120
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,190
The Beckhams Have Conquered America.

121
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,160
<I>Accept It. They're Our Leaders. So,Victoria,How Long</I>

122
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,910
<I>Have You And Wilhelmina Known Each Other?</I>

123
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,700
<I>Oh,Willie And I Go Way Back.</I>

124
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,760
<I>She's Practically My Second Mom. What?</I>

125
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,960
Mum. It's A Flower. She Thinks Of You As A Second Flower.

126
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,350
It's A British Expression.

127
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,470
<I>What Are You Getting The Happy Couple</I>

128
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,400
<I>For A Wedding Present?</I>

129
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,620
<I>Oh,Something Very Special. A Gift From The Heart.</I>

<I>A Year's Supply Of Beckham 24/7,</I>

131
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,130

<I>It's Beck-Mmm.</I>

134
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,350
Is She Hawking Her Sports Drink

135
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,820
In The Middle Of My Wedding Interview?

136
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,330
<I>Ok,You're Focusing On This Way Too Much.</I>

137
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,110
Let's Not Forget That You're Only Getting Married

138
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,230
So You Can Take Over Meade

139
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,530
And Launch Your Own Fashion Magazine. Even That's Off Track.

140
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,710
I Can't Start My Own Magazine Until We Bring Down "Mode."

141
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,150
Apparently The Dynamic Duo, Danny And The Tranny,

142
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,540
Have Gone And Found Some Advertisers To Save This Rag.

143
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,980
Please. "Mode" Is Far From Being Out Of The Woods,

144
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,820
And Once You Take Over The Whole Company,

145
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,360
This Magazine Will Go Down

146
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,320
Faster Than A Crack Whore At A Prison Rodeo.

147
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,080
I Don't Know What The Means, But It Sounds Nasty.

148
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,440
Oh,It's Nasty, Miss Jackson. (Laughs)

149
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,430
<I>(Man) Does Anyone Look As Fabulous As Posh</I>

150
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,930
<I>Feeding Ducks In Central Park?</I>

151
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,330
<I>(Ignacio)  IncreBLe!</I>

152
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,480
Okay,I'm Leaving To Work Now.

153
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,170
Are You Still Not Talking To Me?

154
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,990
What More Is There To Say? You've Been Sneaking Out,

155
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,790
Seeing A Boy Who Got Another Girl Pregnant,

156
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,760
Who's Moving Across The Country In A Few Months,

157
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,750
And You're Foolish Enough To Think

158
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,740
This Is Some Big Romance. Justin,Go Watch Upstairs.

159
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,520
Mom! You See,Dad? This Is Exactly Why I Didn't Tell You.

160
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,000
Look,I Love Henry,Okay? I've Never Felt This Way Before.

161
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,440
Do You Hear Yourself?

162
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,190
You're Talking Like Some Silly 13-Year-Old Girl.

163
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,530
Use Your Head,Betty. He's Going To Leave,

164
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,050
And You're Gonna Have Your Heart Broken. Well,That's My--

165
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,520
Can We Just Calm Down,Please, And Discuss This?

166
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,140
Don't Think I've Forgotten That You Knew About This

167
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,080
The Whole Time And Were Covering For Her! Okay,I Think The Important Thing Here

168
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,360
Is That We Focus On Betty. You Want Me To Focus On Betty? I'll Focus On Betty.

169
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:27,020
You're Not Seeing Henry Again. Dad,I'm 23 Years Old. You Can't Tell Me Who I Can See.

170
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,780
I Can If You're Living In This House!

171
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,210
Then Maybe I Shouldn't Be Living In This House. Betty.

172
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,610
Hey,There's The Door! Fine!

173
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,900
<I>Papi! Ay!</I>

174
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,890
Why Is Everyone In This Family So Freakin' Dramatic?

175
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,780
<I>(Man) And Today Mayor Bloomberg Gave Posh</I>

176
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,710
<I>The Key To The City...</I>

177
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,910
Where Does He Get Off Calling Me A Silly Girl?

178
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,900
Well,He Says Things. Justin,Go Watch Downstairs.

179
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,000
Who Does He Think Has Been Holding This Family Together

180
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,750
Ever Since Mom Died? He's Just Scared For You.

181
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,750
He Thinks You're Doing Something That's A Little Bit Crazy. Well,You Know What,Hilda?

182
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,970
<I>My Entire Life, I've Been The Sensible One.</I>

183
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,810
I Never Even Thought

184
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,260
That I Would Ever Get A Chance At Real Love.

185
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,280
This Might Be It For Me.

186
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,240
Don't I Deserve To Do Something A Little Crazy Just Once?

187
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,120
<I>(Man) After Posh Rang The Opening Bell,</I>

188
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,220
<I>The Dow Soared To New Heights...</I>

189
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,180
<I>Ay,Betty,Please. Do You Have To Do This Now?</I>

190
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,010
It's His Citizenship Ceremony On Saturday. Yeah,Thanks To Me.

191
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,850
Betty,Wait. Justin--

192
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,010
You Know What? If There Was Ever An Argument

193
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,420
For Me To Have My Own Tv, This Would Be It.

194
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,850
(Lowered Voice) What Do You Mean,"Thanks To You"?

195
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,800
(Lowered Voice) How Do You Think Dad Even Got His Visa?

196
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,320
The Lawyers? No. The I.N.S.? No. It Was Me.

197
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,710
Wilhelmina's Father Is A Senator,

198
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,890
And Let's Just Say, I Totally Betrayed Daniel

199
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,910
To Get Her To Call In A Favor And Get Dad Home.

200
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,730
You Did That? And Don't You Dare Tell Him.

201
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,370
I Don't Want Him Knowing I Did Anything For Him.

202
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,150
Betty!

《丑女贝蒂》 第二季第7集

205
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,940
<I>(Bell Dings) Look At This.</I>

206
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,320
"Classy A-Listers, Such As Donna Karan,

207
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,650
"Heidi Klum And Candice Bergen

208
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,980
Will Be Attending The Slater-Meade Wedding."

209
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,030
I'm Not Even Mentioned. I'm Fey Freakin' Sommers' Daughter.

210
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,670
I'm As Classy As They Are.

211
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,720
I've Got Class Comin' Out The Pooper. That You Do,Milady.

212
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,240
<I>And You Arsupposed To Be My P.R. Bitch.</I>

213
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,910
My 15 Minutes Are Almost Up,Marc,

214
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,540
And We've Done Nothing About Them.

215
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,900
We Talked About An Amanda Doll, Maybe A Singing Career,Reb...

216
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,770
I Know These Are Big Dreams, But We've At Least Got To Try.

217
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,140
(Wilhelmina) Marc! My Office! Now! Ugh,Look...

218
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,900
<I>Let Me Just Get My Oldest Married Off First,</I>

219
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,910
And Then It Is All About You. Uh,Pinkie Swear.

220
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,070
Well,It Better Be,

221
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,680
Or I Will Twist Off Your Nipples With A Wrench.

222
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,270
Why The Sudden Interest In My Boys?

223
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,550
Excuse Me,Love.

224
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,070
Can You Help A Bloke Out That's Down To His Last Floggen?

225
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,880
Oh,My God. You Talk Just Like Someone I Know.

226
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,800
Wait,Who Is That? (Gasps) Dot Tell Me.

227
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,530
Don't Tell Me...

228
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,090
Well,Wankle Me Bum.

229
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,330
I Know,Right?

230
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,430
And Then He Tells Me That I'm Not Allowed To See Henry

231
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,070
As Long As I'm Living Under His Roof.

232
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,920
So I Said,"Fine. I Won't Live Under Your Roof."

233
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,180
(Gasps) Oh,Oh,Holy Crap!

234
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,010
You're Telling Me. So I Was Thinking,

235
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,230
Do You Think I Could Crash On Your Couch-- No,No,Quick,This Way.

236
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,040
What? Where Are You Taking Me?

237
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,660
On You Go. In. Qui,Quick. (Gasps) What--What Is--

238
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,420
Never Mind. Ow!

239
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,230
Hello?

240
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,880
Oh,My Goodness, What Is This Place?

241
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,400
It's A Sex Room.

242
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,880
Fey Sommers Had It Built For Her Secret Trysts.

243
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,360
Get Out Of Here.

244
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,170
(Squeals) Shh. I Don't Want Him To Hear Us.

245
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,660
Who? My Husband.

246
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,490
What Husband? The One I Ran Away From In Scotland.

247
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,030
He's Outside.

248
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,870
<I>You Have A Secret Husband And A Secret Sex Room?</I>

249
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,610
(Groans) Oh,My God.

250
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,720
U Just,Like,Totally Trumped My Whole Dad Thing.

251
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,750
Shh. I Haven't Seen Stuart For Five Years,

252
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,400
Not Since I Told Him I Was Going To The Pet Store

253
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,860
To Get Dog Food And I Just... Kept Going.

254
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,090
And You Have A Dog? I Don't Even Know You.

255
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,650
What Do You Think He Wants? I Don't Know.

256
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,280
Maybe He Can't Find The Remote Control.

257
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,200
Well,You Can't Just Hide In Here,Christina.

258
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,080
He Tracked You Down.

259
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,080
Aren't You The Least Bit Curious? (Whimpers)

260
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,540
All Right,Everybody, Let's Give It Up.

261
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,950
Here Comes The Bride In A Vera Wang Original.

262
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,870
I Don't Do That.

263
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,030
Oh,Booty Bop? Wilhelmina Get Out Here.

264
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,750
Oh!

265
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,050
Be Still, My Flaming Heart.

266
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,620
Damn,I'm Good.

267
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,480
Now,Vera,I'm Not Sure About This Train.

268
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,450
<I>Now I Was Thinking--</I>

269
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,950
This Is Major.

270
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,980
(Gasps) Oh,My God, It's Perfect Spice.

271
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,040
I Have A New Muse.

272
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,630
Hello?

273
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,960
Anybody?

274
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,200
Bride Over Here.

275
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,510
You Really Think It's Okay? Rc.

276
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,810
Marc.

277
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,840
It's So Beyond "Okay,"

278
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,120
I'm Giving You A Booty Bop.

279
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,160
Marc!

280
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,870
I'm Sorry,Willie, But Look At Her In That Dress.

281
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,400
She Made Me Feel Tingly Where No Girl Has Ever

282
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,360
Made Me Feel Tingly. (Sighs) Vicki,Darling, I Have A Thought...

283
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,780
No,Not Posh. Don't Hurt Her. Ow! Oh.

284
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,220
You Know What,Vera? I Think We're Gonna Go

285
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,850
In Another Direction, So You Can Leave Now.

286
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,690
You're Not Serious? You're Right.

287
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,590
Marc, Get Her Some Flats.

288
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,150
Goin' On A Trip?

289
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,100
My Father Found Out About Henry And Me.

290
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,090
Things Got Messy, So I Moved Out.

291
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,460
And I Know You Said From The Beginning

292
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,180
That It Was A Mistake, But I Would Really Appreciate It

293
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,350
If You Didn't Say, "I Told You So." Betty,Who Am I To Be Giving You Advice On Relationships?

294
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,390
Have You Taken A Look At My Family Lately? Don't Even Talk About Family.

295
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,270
Busting My Ass For The Last Year To Try To Make... I Mean,I Know That He's Trying To Protect Me...

296
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,510
This Magazine Work. Does He Even Once Say,"Nice Job"? But He Can't Just Shelter Me From The Rest Of The World.

297
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,570
He'll Always See Me As This Little Chubby Girl... I'll Always Be The Irresponsible Playboy

298
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,480
Who Blew Through His Trust Fund In A Year. Who's Gonna Get Asthma If She Runs Too Fast.

299
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,040
And You Know What? I Don't Care. And The Joke Is, I Still Care What He Thinks.

300
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,210
M Not Going. What? I'm Not Going. What?

301
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,270
I'm Not Going To His Wedding. I'm Not Going To His Citizenship Ceremony.

302
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,510
Thank You For Listening. You,Too.

303
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,950
Betty.

304
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,500
Hi.

305
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,470
Hilda Called. She Told Me What Happened.

306
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,420
You're Not Staying With Christina.

307
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,630
You're Staying With Me

308
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,370
It's Been A Long Time, Christina.

309
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,490
Oh,And No Rush Hurrying Back

310
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,890
With That Dog Food, By The Way.

311
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,590
Biscuit Died Three Years Ago.

312
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
What Do You Want,
Stuart?

313
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,500
I Want To Say
I'm Sorry.

314
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,700
I Know I Wasn't A Very Good Husband,Christina

315
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,000
And You Taking Off
Like That Was...

316
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,100
Well, It Was The Kick
I Needed To Get Myself Some Help.

317
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,200
But Part
Of Me Getting Better

318
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,600
Is Making Amends
To Those I Hurt,

319
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
So Here I Am.

320
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,700
Yeah, I'm Sorry
I Ran Out On You.

321
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,300
I Guess
It Was Just Easier To Secretly Put Money Aside
For Two Years,

322
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Hide In A Neighbor's Barn,

323
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,800
Then Wait At The Airport
For Four Days

324
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,400
For A Standby Ticket
To New York

325
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,300
Than It Was To Speak
To My Husband.

326
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
I Hear That.

327
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,600
So Do You Think
We Can Ever Be Friends Again?

328
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
After We Get You Unpacked,

329
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,300
We Can Go Get
Some Chinese Food.

330
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,900
There's This Really Great--

331
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,200
Betty? Come In.

332
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,000
You've Been
In My Apartment Before.

333
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,400
Oh, Here's Your Key.

334
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,800
Oh, Uh, I Don't Need A Key.
You Have To Have A Key.

335
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,700
But Does This Mean--

336
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,300
I Mean--
I Mean, What Does It Mean?

337
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,800
It Means
You Can Open The Door.

338
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, And Here...

339
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,700
And This Empty Drawer
Means You Can Unpack.

340
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
And That Glass Over There

341
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,400
Means You Can Have
A Glass Of Water.

342
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,900
Okay, Uh, Great.

343
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,200
Uh, Yeah, Cool.

344
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,700
Great.

345
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Why Are You Being
So Weird?

346
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,200
I Don't Know, It Just--

347
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,400
This Feels Different.

348
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,000
I Think It Feels Nice.

349
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,600
And, You Know, The Good Part Of All This Stuff
Going On With Your Family

350
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,600
Is We Don't
Have To Hide Anymore.

351
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,500
We Can Be A Real Couple.

352
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,400
Yeah,
We Can Plan Things.

353
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,500
Yeah, Like Christmas.

354
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,400
Oh, Where  You Put
The Christmas Tree?

355
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,200
Right Here.
There?

356
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,300
Yeah.
Really?

357
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,100
Wouldn't It Be So Much Better
Over Here On This Wall?

358
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,800
Ah, But The Radiator's
Over There.

359
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Over Here,
It's In The Window.

360
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,900
Everyone Can See It.
But It Blocks The Window.

361
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,400
If It Was Here--
Yeah, You Know What?
Forget Christmas.

362
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,300
Valentine's Day.

363
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,300
Oh, Why Don't We Go Back To That Sushi Restaurant

364
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,500
Where We Had Our First Date?

365
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,600
It's A Pinkberry Now.

366
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,300
Oh, Even Better.
I Hate Sushi.

367
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,100
Oh, Um,
This Could Be Really Fun--

368
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,300
I Heard Hall & Oates Are Gonna
Be In Town...

369
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,200
 In April.

370
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,400
Oh.

371
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,100
What?

372
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,700
Uh, April.

373
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,400
Uh, Oh. Oh, God.
Uh, That's Right.

374
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,500
That Was Stupid.

375
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Forget I Said It.
Erase Awkward Moment.

376
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,800
Um, No, I Totally Knew That
You'd Be Back In Tucson By Then.

377
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,000
I Just... I'm Just Gonna Go
And Unpack My Toothbrush

378
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,200
And My Stuff In The Bathroom.

379
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Um, I'll Be Right Back.

380
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,100
Betty, That's The Closet.

381
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Oh, Yeah, I Know.
I Just, Uh, Need A Minute.

382
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,300
You Know, It's Bad Luck

383
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,700
To See The Bride
On Her Wedding Day.

384
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,900
Not For The Bodyguard.

385
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,600
So You Think You Might
Need Some Protection On Your Honeymoon?

386
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,200
Dwayne,
Sweet, Horny Dwayne...

387
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,900
Beat It.

388
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,200
Mama's Weave Can't
Get Sweaty On Her Big Day.

389
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,200
Can I At Least
Take A Shower?

390
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,900
(Sighs) Don't Use
The Good Shampoo.

391
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,800
This Is Room 1220.

392
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,500
I'd Like My Breakfast,
Please.

393
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,700
(Woman) Yes, Ms. Slater.

394
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,100
<I>Last Night Victoria Beckham
Set Gotham Ablaze.</I>

395
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,000
<I>Posh Wore
Her Maid Of Honor Gown</I>

396
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,300
<I>For A Night On The Town.</I>

397
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,900
<I>Once Again, Vicki B.
Has Stolen The Spotlight</I>

398
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,500
<I>From Wilhelmina,
Tigging The Queson,</I>

399
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,000
<I>Whose Big Day Is It?</I>

400
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,900
Okay,
Do I Wear The Flag Tie,

401
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,000
The Flag Pin Or Bo?

402
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,700
<I>If You Wear A Flag Tie,
I'm Leaving The Country.</I>

403
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,600
Pin It Is.

404
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Unbelievable.

405
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,500
One Of The Biggest Days
Of My Life,

406
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,600
<I>And She Doesn't Even Call.

407
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,800
Ay, Papi.</I>

408
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,200
You Know Betty Loves You.

409
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,300
She Doesn't Act Like It.

410
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,700
She Lied
And Disrespected Me,

411
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,100
And All I Wanted To Do
Was Protect Her.

412
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,600
All She's Thinking About
Is Herself.

413
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,100
<I>Okay, DJAlo, DJAlo.</I>

414
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,700
Listen, You Have No Idea
What Betty's Done For You.

415
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,700
Hilda, What Are You
Talking About?

416
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,300
I Love That
You've Got A Sex Room.

417
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
You've Really Made It.

418
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Well, Technically,

419
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,100
It's Not Really Mine,

420
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,000
But It Was Convenient,
Wasn't It?

421
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,800
So Was It, Um,
As Good As You Remember?

422
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,900
Well, You Didn't Pass Out
Drunk Midway Through,

423
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,500
<I>So I Suppose
It Was A Mild Improvement.</I>

424
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,400
I Missed You,
Christina.

425
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,900
Didn't Think
I'd Missed You.

426
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,900
But You Did?

427
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,700
(Whispers) A Wee Bit.

428
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,900
I'm Gonna Use The Loo.

429
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,300
(Normal Voice)
Do You Know What?
What?

430
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,800
I'd Forgotten About
Good Stuart.

431
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,100
Oh, Good Stuart
Was Always There.

432
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,200
He Was Just...
A Little Lost

433
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,200
And A Lot Pissed.

434
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,400
Well, Just You Remember--

435
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,300
Good Stuart Remembers To Put
The Toilet Seat Down

436
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,400
When He's Finished.

437
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,500
Right.

438
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,700
(Whispers)
Bad, Bad Stuart.

439
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,900
Oh, You're Awake.

440
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,400
Good Morning.

441
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,900
(Muffled Voice)
I Was Gonna Sneak Out

442
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,000
And Brush My Teeth
Before You Woke Up.

443
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,600
What?
No, Don't Be Silly.

444
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
You Should Be Comfortable
With Who You Are.

445
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,100
So Listen, I Am Never
In Manhattan On A Saturday.

446
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,800
Yeah?

447
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,700
And There's That Brunch Place
On Bank Street

448
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,500
That Has The Cute Little
Baby Ducks On The Awning,

449
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,100
And I Have No Idea What They
Serve, But The Ducks Are Cute.

450
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,200
(Normal Voice)
Betty, They Serve Baby Duck.

451
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,200
What?

452
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,100
(Laughing)
You're So Easy.

453
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,100
Shut Up.

454
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
So I Was Thinking...
Yeah.

455
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,600
After Breakfast,

456
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,800
You And I Could Go
On A Little Adventure.

457
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,700
Ta-Da.
New York Transit Museum?

458
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,300
Mm-Hmm. Well, I Know What A Fan
You Are Of The Subway System,

459
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,100
And There Was That Freaky
Third Rail Experience You Had.

460
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,100
Well,
My Glasses Were Foggy,

461
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,000
But I Do Think
I Saw My Nana Down There.
Yeah, Probably.

462
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,500
Anyway, I Thought
It Would Be Fun.

463
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,200
Yeah.

464
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,100
What? What--What--
What's With The Face?

465
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,100
You Don't Wanna Go?

466
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,000
No, No, Of Course I Do.
Who Wouldn't?

467
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,100
It's Just...

468
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,300
Don't You Think
You Should Go To Your Dad's
Citizenship Ceremony?

469
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,200
No. Henry, No.

470
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,900
I-I Made A Decision,

471
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,700
And Today Is About Us,

472
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,200
And I Wanna Do
Something Crazy And Fun.

473
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,500
New York Transit Museum
It Is.

474
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,000
<I>(Man) And We'll Be Back
With A Ticker Tape Parade...</I>

475
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,500
<I>In Honor Of Victoria Beckham.</I>

476
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,200
Oh, I Thought
You Were Room Service.

477
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,500
I Want To Talk
To My Ther.

478
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Bradford's Suite
Is On The Tenth Floor.

479
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,900
Separate Rooms The Night
Before The Wedding.

480
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,100
You Know What
An Old-Fashioned Girl I Am.

481
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,100
That Must Be
What He Sees In You.

482
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,500
I Want You
To Give These To Him.

483
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,400
I Won't Be Attending
The Wedding.

484
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,800
Oh, What A Shame.

485
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,500
I Guess
I'll Have To Do

486
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,000
Our Mother-Son Dance
With Alexis.

487
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,300
Who Is That?

488
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,600
Posh.

489
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,700
Spice Girl Can't Handle
Spicy Foods. Go Figure.

490
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,500
I'll Make Sure
Bradford Gets These. Bye.

491
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,300
(Laughs)
Come On, I-I Know
I Have That Coupon

492
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,500
For The Transit Museum
Somewhere In My Desk.

493
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,000
You Know, I Really Don't Mind
Paying The Extra 10 Bucks.

494
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,700
I Know, But You Get This Free Subway Map
Shower Curtain With It,

495
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,300
And Hilda
Could Really Use That Because She Still Has Trouble
With The "A" Line,

496
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,600
And There's Just No Reason
For Her To End Up

497
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
At The Bronx Zoo
As Often As She Does.

498
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,300
Who's In Wilhelmina's Office?

499
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,500
Daniel?

500
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,300
Oh, Betty, Henry, Hi.

501
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,900
Booze And Pills Weren't Enough?
(Needle Hits Floor)

502
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,400
I See You've Graduated.
I Can Explain--

503
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,200
No, Don't Bother. I Have
Had Enough Of Your Excuses.

504
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,900
<I>I Was So Stupid
To Actually Think--</I>

505
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm Sick.

506
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,700
It's My Liver.

507
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
All The Drinking
Finally Did Me In.

508
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,400
That Medication's
Just A Band-Aid.

509
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
So What Exactly
Are We Talking About Here?

510
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,600
$100,000 For
An Experimental Treatment.

511
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,400
That's The Reason
I'm In New York.

512
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,100
And How Are You
Gonna Get That Money?

513
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,700
I'm Not.

514
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,800
Good News Is
That In Six Months Time,

515
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,000
You Will Be Inheriting
My Mom's Spoon Collection.

516
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,100
Oh, Stuart.

517
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,800
I Have Always Wanted
That Spoon Collection...

518
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,600
Just Not Like This.

519
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,700
Stay In New York.

520
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,100
Why?

521
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,200
I Don't Know How,

522
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,000
But I'm--I'm Gonna
Get You The Money, Okay?

523
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,700
(Whispers) Yeah.

524
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
And Then I See Her Bodyguard
Leaving Her Room.

525
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,000
What Else Could It Be,
Right?

526
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,700
Um, Yeah, I Mean,
That Sounds Suspicious.

527
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,300
Did You Hear Anyone Say Anything
At All?

528
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,600
Do You Know If--
No, No I Don't.

529
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,900
I Don't Know Anythg.

530
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,100
But, Daniel, If--If You Think
That This Is True,

531
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,700
Then You Should Go
To Your Father And Tell Him

532
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,000
Before He Marries That Woman.

533
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,800
He Knows How I Feel
About Wilhelmina.

534
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,900
I Can't Go To Him
Without Any Proof.

535
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,300
I Just Wish There Was ???

536
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,900
Ah, Don't Worry About It, Betty.

537
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,200
It's Not Your Problem.

538
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,700
Although, I Think I Am
Gonna Go To His Wedding.

539
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,800
Maybe I Can Get Something
Out Of The Bodyguard.

540
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,100
Good Idea. Yeah.

541
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,500
Because That Guy
Seems Like A Big Dummy.

542
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,100
<I>The Other Day He Said Something
Was A Mute Point. (Scoffs)</I>

543
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,300
That Was Me.

544
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,900
"Moot," "Mute"--
I Get It Now.

545
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,900
Oh...
Well, He's Dumb, Too.

546
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,600
I'm Not Making This Better.

547
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,100
Hi, I'm Amanda Sommers.

548
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,700
I'm Fey Sommers' Daughter.

549
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,000
Oh, Hi There. Hello.

550
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,200
I'm Amanda Sommers.

551
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,100
I Am Fey Sommers' Daughter.

552
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,900
Oh, Hi. 

553
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,000
(Lowered Voice)
Being A Celebrity Is So Hard.

554
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,400
Everyone Just Wants
A Piece Of You.

555
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,000
Yeah, How About That?
Hey, Have You Seen Cliff Yet?

556
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,900
(Normal Voice)
Don't Worry.

557
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Your Wide Load Lover Will Be
Here Any Minute.

558
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,500
(Groans) Amanda, No Jokes.
I'm Freaking Out.

559
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,900
I'm Debuting Him Today
As My Boyfriend,

560
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,000
And I Have No Idea What's
Gonna Walk Though That Door.

561
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,900
Sweetie, Relax.

562
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,600
He Can't Fit
Through Those Doors.

563
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,500
Stop It.

564
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,200
Trans-Fatty...

565
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,400
More Than Meets The Eye.

566
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,900
Aw, Look At My Boyfriend.

567
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,400
Who Knew
There Were Hardwood Floors Under That Shag Rug?

568
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
Hardwood Floors!

569
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,900
(Chuckles)
That's My Boyfriend.

570
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,500
That's My Boyfriend.
Hardwood Floors.

571
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,700
So... (Chuckles)

572
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,300
What Do You Think?

573
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,900
I Can't Believe
You Did This.

574
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,800
I Knew What A Big Deal It Was
To You, Meeting Your Friends.

575
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,600
I Didn't Want To Be A Jerk.

576
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,500
(Chuckles)
So How Does It Feel?

577
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
I'm Sweating,
My Collar's Too Tight...

578
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,200
(Clenched Teeth)
And These Shoes Really Hurt.

579
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,600
Beauty Is Pain, Cliff...

580
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,600
And You Are Hurting Me Bad.

581
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,200
Betty, We Can Go To The Transit Museum
Another Time.

582
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,800
Today You're Going To Your Father's
Citizenship Ceremony.

583
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,400
Betty.

584
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,700
I Already Told You
That I Didn't Want

585
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,100
To Be Anywhere
Near Here, Henry.

586
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,100
Why Would You Do This?

587
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
Because You're Pretending You Can Live
Without Your Family, Betty,

588
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,000
But It's Just An Act. I've Seen You Guys Together.

589
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You're Like This... And When I Leave,

590
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,000
They're Gonna Be The Ones
Who Are Here For You.

591
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
<I>Rich Old Guy. Hot!</I>

592
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,000
Okay, This Is Weird,

593
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,900
But Has Cliff
Been Talking To That Guy

594
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,500
For Kind Of A Long Time?

595
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,400
Is He Sucking On That Lamb Chop
A Little... Seductively?

596
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,900
Seductively
Or Disgustingly?

597
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,000
Hey. Hi. Come Here.

598
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,100
Oh, He Did Not Just Give Me
The "One Minute" Finger.

599
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,000
<I>Ooh, Denied.</I>

600
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,800
(All)
I Hereby Declare An Oath

601
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,000
That I Absolutely And Entirely

602
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,800
Renounce And Abjure

603
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,600
All Allegiance And Fidelity

604
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,400
To Any Foreign Prince,
State Or Sovereignty,

605
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,300
Of Whom Or Which
I Have Heretofore

606
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,400
Been A Subject Or Citizen...

607
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,300
Gwyneth's Wearing White
To The Wedding?

608
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,000
<I>That Is Such A Bitch Slap.</I>

609
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,500
That I Will Support And Defend
The Constitution And Laws

610
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,300
Of The United States
Of America

611
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,900
Against All Enemies,
Foreign And Domestic,

612
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,600
That I Will Bear True Faith
And Allegiance To The Same.

613
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,500
Hello.

614
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,600
Oh, Hey, Marc,
This Is Tony.

615
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,400
Don't Care.

616
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,200
That Was Rude.
So Is Tramping It Up

617
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,000
With That "Hot Ten Years Ago"
Cater Waiter

618
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,500
<I>With Clearly Waxed Eyebrows.

619
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,200
I Knew They Were Waxed.
He Swears That He Was Born</I>

620
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,600
With The Perfect
Joan Crawford Arch.

621
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,900
Oh, Please, Not Even Joan--

622
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,300
Wait A Minute.
I'm Angry!
About What?

623
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,500
Tony's A Model I've Worked With.
We're Just Friends.

624
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,800
Oh, Please. We're Gay.

625
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,500
There's No Such Thing
As Just Friends.

626
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
(Laughs) He's Straight.

627
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,900
Uh, Uh, A Straight Model.

628
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,000
Well, I Guess
The World Is Upside Down.

629
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,200
What Is Wrong With You?

630
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
???

631
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,600
A Baby Abandoned
In A Dumpster While Mommy Explores
Her Newfound Hotness.

632
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,700
Well, I've Had It.
Can We--

633
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,800
<I>No MS.

634
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,200
This Thing
Between Us Is Over.</I>

635
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,100
(Man) Say "Cheese."

636
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,800
Hi.
(Laughs)

637
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,300
Can...

638
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So, D-Dawg, What's Up?

639
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,300
It's Daniel Meade.
We Met.

640
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,600
Bodyguard, Huh? That's
An Interesting Line Of Work.

641
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,700
You Must Get
A Lot Of Action.

642
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,500
Big, Strong, Good-Looking Guy
Like You...

643
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,900
You Hittin' On Me?
No. No, No, No.

644
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,500
No. No, This Is About
You And Wilhelmina.

645
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,300
I Just Need
A Few Answers.

646
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,600
I've Got A Blank Check
For Some Information About...

647
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,200
My Checkbook.
Oh, Damn It.

648
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,100
I Left It On The Dresser.
I Could See It Right There.

649
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,300
Well, Well, Well.

650
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,200
I Thought I Heard
A Meeting Of The Minds.

651
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,600
Game Over, Wilhelmina.

652
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,800
Dwayne Just Told Me
Everything Aut You Two.

653
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,700
Mm, Nice Try, Daniel.

654
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,700
There's Nothing Going On
Between Dwayne And I.

655
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,000
<I>But For Argument's Sake,
Let's Say I Was Enjoying</I>

656
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,800
The Pleasure Of This Tall Glass
Of Chocolate Milk.

657
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,700
I Would Think You'd Run
Straight To Your Father,

658
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,100
But Oh, Wait, You Can't,

659
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,700
And Do You Know Why You Can't?

660
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,700
He Has No Proof.
Dwayne.

661
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,700
I Was Building Up To That.

662
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,700
But He's Right.
You Have No Oof.

663
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,100
I Will See You
At The Altar.

664
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,000
Can You Believe Him?

665
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,200
Suddenly He's The Hottest Guy
In The Room,

666
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,000
And... (Scoffs)

667
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,600
I'm Not Good Enough.

668
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,200
Marc, I Got To Be Honest
With You.

669
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,600
I Do Like His New Suit.

670
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,900
But Seriously,
He's Only 15% Hotter.

671
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,500
Oh, Really? Then Why Is
Every Waiter Serving Him Food?

672
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,400
Why Is Every Bartender
Pouring Him Drinks?

673
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,500
Oh, My God,
It's Happened.

674
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,700
You're Looking Past
The Outside

675
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,600
<I>And Seeing
What's On The Inside.</I>

676
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,800
You're Falling For Him.

677
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,300
You're Falling
For An Average Man.

678
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Oh, God. I Am.

679
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,000
I'm An Average-Man Lover.

680
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
What Do I Do?

681
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,200
You Accept It.

682
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,600
You Are Deeper
Than You Think.

683
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
It's Okay.
We All Have Flaws.

684
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,000
But I-I Broke Up With Him.

685
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,100
Then You Get Out There,

686
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,600
And You Do
Something Amatic

687
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,500
To Show That Fatty
How Much You Care.

688
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,300
Like, You Run
Through The Airport,

689
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,700
And You
Bust Through Security,

690
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,600
And Just As The Doors
Of The Plane Are Closing,

691
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,700
You Scream At The Top
Of Your Lungs, "Cliff!"

692
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,600
You Calling Me?

693
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,800
Or You Just Go Over There
And Talk To Him.

694
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,700
(Sighs) I'm Sorry
I Said Those Things.

695
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,300
And I'm Sorry That I Didn't
Tell You About Me And Henry.

696
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,200
It's Just...
Dad, You're Right.

697
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,100
I'm Doing Something
Really Stupid.

698
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,800
And You're Gonna
Keep Doing It, Right?

699
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,600
Yeah.

700
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,400
And When He Leaves,
I'm Gonna Fall Apart.

701
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,100
And I Want You To Promise Me
You'll Be Here To Pick Me Up.

702
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,700
I'm Your Father.

703
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,900
Where Else Am I Gonna Be?

704
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,200
You're Still Crying?

705
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,500
Yeah, First He Became
A Citizen,

706
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,300
And Now Betty...

707
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,500
Just Watch Your Tv.

708
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,000
So This Does Mean
You're Coming Back Home, Right?

709
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,900
Yes.

710
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,000
Hilda Told Me What You Did
To Make This Happen.

711
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,800
Hilda Sucks At Secrets.

712
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,700
Daniel's Done So Much
For You, Betty.

713
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,100
You Can't Betray
A Friend For Me.

714
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,700
Dad, If I Tell Daniel
About Wilhelmina,

715
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,300
She'll Try And Do Something
To Mess Up Your Citizenship.

716
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,500
I'm An American Now.

717
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,100
Let Her Try.

718
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,700
All Right, People.
Let's Get This Over With.

719
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,900
I Mean,
Let's Get Me Married Off

720
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,200
To The Most Wonderful Man
In The Whole World.

721
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,500
Actually, Ms. Slater,
There's Just One Problem.

722
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,800
Your Maid Of Honor...

723
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,600
We Can't
Find Her Anywhere.

724
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,300
Oh, Posh Flaked?

725
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Oh, Darn.

726
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
Well, I Guess We'll Have
To Go Ahead Without Her.

727
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,500
Poor Thing,
I Hope She's All Right.

728
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,800
All Right, People.
Focus On The Joy.

729
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,000
Flowers!

730
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
Hello

731
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,000
Anybody Out There?

732
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,900
I Think The Door's Locked!

733
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,700
This Really Is Major.

734
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,400
Dear Friends,

735
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
We Are Gathered Here Today

736
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,600
To Join In Holy Matrimony

737
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,400
Wilhelmina Slater
And Bradford Meade.

738
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
I Object!
(Gsts Gasp)

739
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,300
We Haven't Gotten
To That Part Yet.

740
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,300
Oh.

741
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Oh, I Knew It.

742
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,000
I Knew Wilhelmina
Was Sleeping With Her Bodyguard.

743
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,100
When Did You Find Out?

744
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,300
Daniel, It's Not Really
Important. Just Go In There

745
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,400
And Talk To Your Father
And Stop The Wedding!

746
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,400
No, No, No,???

747
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,700
I Mean,
You're My Only Proof.

748
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,200
So Did You Find Out On Your Own?
Did Someone Tell You?

749
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
I Saw Them.

750
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,500
Wait, What? When?

751
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,500
Um,

752
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,500
Four Months Ago When I Went
To Wilhelmina's Apartment To Get The Book.

753
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,700
Four Months Ago And You Waited
Till Now To Tell Me?

754
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,200
No, Daniel, It's Not
What It Sounds Like.

755
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,300
It's Very Complicated--

756
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,500
No. It's Not Complicated.

757
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,100
Betty, You Kw I've Been
Trying To Find A Way

758
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,800
To Open My Father's Eyes
About This Woman.

759
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,000
But She Was Using Me--

760
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I Don't Want To Hear
Your Excuses.

761
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,300
Betty,
You're The One Person

762
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,700
I Always Counted On Being
On My Side,

763
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,400
And You Betrayed Me.

764
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,800
For Wilhelmina?

765
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,400
How Could I Ever
Trust You Again?

766
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,500
Daniel, Please--
Just Stop.

767
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,700
I Can't Even Look
At You.

768
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,400
You're Fired.

769
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,500
Do You,
Bradford Emerson Meade,

770
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,300
Take This Woman,
Wilhelmina--

771
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,500
Sorry. Do You--
Do You Need Something?

772
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,000
I Really Need
To Speak With You.

773
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,800
Yes, Just As Soon As He Takes Me
As His Lawfully Wedded Wife.

774
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,100
Let's Go, Bradford.

775
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
Really, Dad. It's Important.

776
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,100
Just Give Me A Moment.

777
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,100
Well,
I'll Just Go Ahead

778
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,000
And Do My Part
While You're Gone.

779
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,000
I Do.

780
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,100
Oh, No. I-I'm Sorry.

781
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,400
It Really Doesn't Work
That Way.

782
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,000
(Whispers) Do Something.

783
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,100
(Normal Voice)
Um, Ladies And Gentlemen,

784
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,800
While We Wait
For The Ceremony To Resume,

785
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,100
Perhaps A Song
From Our Own Amanda Sommers,

786
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,900
Daughter Of The Late,
Great Fey Sommers.
(Amanda Whispers) What?

787
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,500
(Lowered Voice)
Your 15 Minutes Are Almost Up.

788
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,600
Quincy Jones
Is In The Fourth Row.

789
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,900
Now Sing, Bitch.

790
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,500
Why ??

791
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,300
My...

792
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,300
???

793
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,200
And ?

794
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,300
U ???

795
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,300
To Try To Poison
This Relationship, Wouldn't You?

796
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,900
I've Got To Admit,
I Admire Your Tenacity.

797
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,100
Look, I Am Not
Making This Up.

798
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,700
Betty Saw Them Together!

799
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,500
Oh, Really?

800
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,800
Then How Come Betty's Not
Here Telling Me This?

801
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,900
She... She's Gone.

802
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,000
How Convenient.
You're Unbelievable.

803
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,800
I Am The Only One
Willing To Be Honest With You.

804
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Will You At Least Consider
The Possibility--

805
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,400
I Am Not Gonna
Throw Away Something

806
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,300
Based On Some Crazy Accusation
Made By Some Assistant.

807
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,900
Look At You.

808
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,000
You're Sweating, Dad.

809
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,500
<I>Maybe It's Because Deep Inside,
You Know This Is Wrong.</I>

810
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,600
I'm Sweating
Because You Are Driving

811
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,300
My Blood Pressure Up
By The Minute.

812
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,500
That Woman
Doesn't Love You At All!

813
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,900
Get Out Of My Way.

814
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,700
Everything All Right?

815
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,600
Yeah, Fine.
Please, Continue.

816
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,600
(Man Clears Throat) Do You,
Bradford Emerson Meade,

817
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,100
Take This Woman,
Wilhelmina Vivian Slater...

818
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,800
(Voice Distorts)
As Your Lawful Wedded Wife

819
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,500
To Have And To Hold

820
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
From This Day Forward

821
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,100
In Sickness And In Health

822
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,100
For Richer Or For Poorer...

823
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
In Good Times And In Bad...

824
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,900
For As Long
As You Both Shall Live?

825
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,400
Oh, My God! Dad!

826
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,300
(Wilhelmina) Bradford!

827
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,700
Someone Call 9-1-1.

828
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,100
(Daniel) Come On, Dad.

829
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,300
Don't You Die!

830
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,800
Don't You Dare Die!

831
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,600
Wilhelmina!

832
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,900
Come On, Dad, Breathe.

833
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,500
One One Thousand.
Two One Thousand.

834
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,000
Three One Thousand.
Four One Thousand.

835
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,200
Five One Thousand.
Come On, Dad.

836
