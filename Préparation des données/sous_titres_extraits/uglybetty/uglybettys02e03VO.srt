00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,000
and ????

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,900
if bradford meade
is yo' daddy.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,100
(man) it's your mother's
beloved dog halston.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,300
partial retrograde amnesia?
the last thing
alexis remembers

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,400
is mom's birthday party
two years ago.

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,100
with alexis
still in the hospital,

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,200
i want to postpone
the wedding.

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,300
your father was a hero.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,500
?????

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,800
(justin) no, i'm not.

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,100
it looks like we'll need
an intern around the office

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,100
for the next couple of weeks
before school starts.

14
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,300
oh, my god!

15
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,300
and my dad's
ill stuck in mexico.

16
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,300
(ignacio) i killed ignacio suarez?

17
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,300
????

18
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,900
let me tell you something
about this baby of yours.

19
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,700
christina told me about charlie,
that she cheated on me.

20
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,800
charlie was the only reason
we couldn't be together.

21
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,400
i want to be with you,
betty.

22
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,000
henry,'re drunk.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,700
(slurs)
and you're beautiful.

24
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,200
henry, stop.

25
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,200
look, this is not how i ever
pictured us being together.

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,500
you're drunk
of... wine coolers.

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,200
"melon and apricot."
it's gross.

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,100
you're right.

29
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,100
i'm a terrible person.

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,900
i had a cigarette, too.

31
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,500
why didn't you tell me about
charlie and that dentist?

32
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:19,700
i...

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,800
look, i've wanted to.
i just...

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,300
started thinking that maybe
it wasn't the right thing to do.

35
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,400
henry,
there is a baby involved.

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,100
which might not be mine.
but maybe it is,

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,200
and i-i can't get
my heart broken again.

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,400
it's like the whole world
is telling us

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,700
we shouldn't be together.

40
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,700
we're like
melon and apricot.

41
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,000
look,
i do want to be with you.

42
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,200
i do, it's...

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,300
it's just--
we don't know whose baby it is,

44
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,700
and we just have to wait,

45
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,800
and i can do that

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,700
if you can.

47
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,600
(daniel) wow.
(amanda) yeah.

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,900
that's it?
those are
the d.n.a. results.

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,400
so, uh, h-how many times
do you think we...

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,300
<i>alot, but just remember,</i>

51
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,000
if your dad's d.n.a.
does match mine,

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,700
we're only half brother
and sister,

53
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,700
which means if we did it,
like, 20 times,

54
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,000
it was only wrong ten.
okay, that actually
made sense to me.

55
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,600
<i>you are so my sister.
oh, my god.
i can't take it anymore.</i>

56
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,500
(gasps)
bradford's not my father!
you're not my sister?

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,200
kissing isn't weird at all.
it's great.
we're not related.

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,700
we could kiss all we want,
right?

59
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,100
yeah,
we can totally do this.

60
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,700
nothing taboo here.

61
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,000
(giggles)
you know what?
why don't we hop in--

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,200
daniel, no. i have
unresolved issues with you.

63
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,000
so just squeeze a boob,
because i have to go.

64
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,200
oh, my god.
this is so humiliating.

65
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,300
i've never done this before.

66
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,400
try this.

67
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,500
it's tomato juice, raw egg
and a little bacon grease...

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,400
a trick i learned
in high school.

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,100
hangover gone
by third period.

70
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,600
tastes as good as it sounds.

71
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,900
sorry we didn't
take your shoes off

72
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,500
before you went
to bed last night,

73
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,900
but we could not untie
those double knots.

74
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,400
i worry about tripping.

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,700
so you must be dying
to call that bitch.

76
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,700
charlie?

77
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,700
honestly, i'm afraid to.

78
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
i don't know what i'm gonna do
when i hear her voice.

79
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,600
i' never been this mad.

80
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,800
this is you mad?

81
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,600
yeah.

82
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,100
i feel like
a female orangutan

83
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,200
when she's in estrous

84
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,300
and a nondominant male
tries to mount her.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,800
she just bares her fangs
and attacks blindly.

86
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,600
that story
would be more effective

87
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,200
if you compared yourself
to the male orangutan,

88
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,900
and if i knew
what estrous was.

89
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,500
you hungry?

90
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,100
oh! oh.

91
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,000
i'm glad you're not mad at me
for spilling the beans.

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,700
he had to find out somehow,
right?

93
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,100
yeah. so what ????
i don't know.

94
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,200
wait,
try not to think about it,

95
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,800
which is easy,
because i have so much to do

96
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
for this benefit tonight.

97
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,200
oh, please, don't talk to me
about the black & white ball.

98
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,500
i have been gluing crap
onto these things for two weeks.

99
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,400
glitter came out in my pee
yesterday.

100
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,100
yeah,
but it's all for charity,

101
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,900
and it's daniel's
favorite event of the year.

102
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,600
he gets to go up onstage
and present

103
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,700
that giant check thingy.

104
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,600
yeah, men get excited about
things like that, don't they?

105
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,300
(bell tinkles)
oh, yay! the sandwich guy!

106
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,400
i got too excited, right?

107
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,600
well, maybe.

108
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,800
okay, chicken and cheese special
on a baguette.

109
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,800
no chicken, no cheese,
no baguette.

110
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,900
i just sold her
a plate of lettuce for 7 bucks.

111
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,200
<i>yes, but that's her breakfast,
lunch and dinner,</i>

112
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,100
so really, it's a bargain.
mm.

113
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,500
could i please get
the turkey sun-dried tomato

114
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,500
on a baguette, please?
yes! man,
i knew you were an eater.

115
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,300
oh. thank you...

116
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,500
i guess.

117
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,300
so you're new.
what happened to robert?

118
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,200
you know,
i think he inherited money...

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,200
or was arrested.

120
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,000
oh.

121
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,900
i don't know. there was
a lawyer and cash involved.

122
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,500
well, welcome.

123
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,100
hey, betty. can you get me this
for the, uh, benefit tonight?

124
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,700
uh, okay, yes. thank you.

125
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,300
daniel!

126
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
the ibot
motorized wheelchair?

127
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,700
i thought you were supposed
to be walking by today

128
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,600
no, i still need therapy.

129
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,500
i'm
still in a lot of pain, betty.

130
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
thanks.

131
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,600
ok, i know
that you feel really bad

132
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,900
about this whole
alexis thing...

133
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,600
but do you think
maybe your pain

134
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,700
could be more emotional
than physical?

135
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,100
my leg isn't crying, betty.
it's hurting.

136
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,900
just get me the wheelchair,
okay?

137
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,400
okay, i'll just add it
to my list.
oh, and about the check.

138
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,900
can you, um, make sure
the check is big,

139
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,300
but not so big it makes
my head look small?
okay.

140
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,500
and it should be...
(clears throat) blue or green.

141
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,000
blue. got it.
see, 'cause last year,
it was beige,

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,200
and in all the photos,
i was kinda washed out.

143
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
whatever you need.

144
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,200
(telephone rings)
daniel meade's office.

145
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
<i>fashion gives back--</i>

146
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,400
<i>once again, it's
the "mode" black & white ball</i>

147
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,600
<i>benefiting
new york children's hospital.</i>

148
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
<i>yes, the clothes
will be fabulous</i>

149
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,800
<i>and the kids will be sick.</i>

150
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,500
<i>unfortunately, this year,
claire meade will not be able</i>

151
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,100
<i>to fulfill
her usual hostess duties</i>

152
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,800
<i>as she's on the lam,
which, i understand,</i>

153
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,600
<i>is what mario batali
is serving as the main course.</i>

154
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,500
<i>but in the spirit
of black & white, </i>

155
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,000
<i>the ball will be presided
over by bradford meade</i>

156
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,600
<i>and fiancée wilhelmina slater.</i>

157
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,000
<i>or should i say ex-fiancée?</i>

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,100
<i>since apparently, the wedding
has been postponed.</i>

159
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,200
<i>trouble in paradise?
turn it off.</i>

160
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,800
ugh.
this is so humiliating.

161
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
my closest friends in the world
will be there tonight.

162
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,000
can you imagine how happy
this is gonna make them?

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,200
oh! it's just
a temporary setback.

164
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,200
you'll still have the wedding
in a few months.

165
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,100
if bradford thinks
he loves you now,

166
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,600
he'll think
he loves you then.
the longer we wait,

167
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,100
the more time bradford's spawn
will have to talk him out of it.

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,700
(sighs)
i'm done, marc. it's over.

169
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,300
now you listen to me, lady.

170
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,800
the wilhelmina slater i know
and occasionally wish i was

171
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,000
does not throw in the towel

172
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,500
just because
the old man she's scamming

173
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,700
<i>has suddenly gone all soft
for his tramnesiac daughter.</i>

174
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,700
you're touching me.

175
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,900
it was a risk.
oh.

176
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,300
i just didn't count on
the father/daughter rebonding.

177
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,700
i hate that love won out.
well, maybe someone should
remind daddy's little girl

178
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,300
that she hates daddy,
and that she spent

179
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,400
the last two years
trying to bring him down.

180
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,700
wait a minute.
aah!

181
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,200
oh, did i say something smart?
i love it when i do that.

182
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,600
how are you at photoshop?
a-mah-zing.

183
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,300
i'm about to rewrite history.

184
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,700
this sure beats a 40-ounce.

185
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,500
the wedding's postponed.
do you know what this means?

186
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
wilhelmina is losing
her grip on bradford.

187
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,200
why we gotta talk about him
during family time?

188
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,200
i made this rum punch
out of pomegranate.

189
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,500
there ain't no more guava.

190
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,200
yoga, please. if i'm ever
going to get him back, it's now.

191
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,200
i've got to go
to that ball tonight.

192
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,400
i've got to talk to him.

193
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,500
you a wanted felon.
cinderella can't go to no ball.

194
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,700
she can
if it's a masked ball.

195
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,700
oh, hey! uh,
i'm glad you're still here.

196
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,500
there's just a little problem
with my sandwich.

197
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,300
oh, man. is there a hair?

198
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,400
i'm, like, the only one left
in my family with a full head.

199
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,800
uh, no. it's just that there are
only three sun-dried tomatoes.

200
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,000
yeah. yeah, i know.
i made it.

201
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,200
oh, okay.

202
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,600
uh, it's just that robert
would always put more,

203
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,600
so...

204
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,300
sorry. i don't know
where robert is.

205
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,600
i'm not his keeper, okay?

206
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,300
but robert didn't know jack
about food.

207
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,600
a sun-dried tomato
is a concentrated flavor.

208
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,400
more than three
on a sandwich

209
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,800
would overwhelm
the smoky flavor of the turkey.

210
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,300
okay, uh, you know what?
i think my turkey can handle it.

211
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,400
so could i just please have
some more sun-dried tomatoes?

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,900
nah.

213
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
it would be wrong.

214
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,500
i-i want my sandwich
the way i want my sandwich.

215
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,800
wow.

216
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,800
(chuckles) you know,
when i first saw you,

217
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,900
i thought, "wow. there goes
a girl from the neighborhood.

218
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,200
what is she doing here?"

219
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,200
now i see you're just like all
the other spoiled "mode" girls.

220
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,400
no. no, i'm not!

221
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,800
you know, i bet
before you got here,

222
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,200
you didn't even know
what a sun-dried tomato was.

223
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,800
you just reached into the cart

224
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,400
and pulled out whatever
had the most cheese.
i...

225
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,200
i still eat cheese.

226
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,200
i mean, how dare he act
like he knows who i am?

227
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,600
and wh-why do i even have
to explain myself?

228
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,800
okay, betty, not really sure
why you're so upset.

229
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,500
sun-dried tomatoes,
really?

230
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,700
i mean, don't you find them
kind of salty and breathy?

231
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,700
no, it's not just that.
it's...

232
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,300
i mean,
he was so rude to me.

233
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,300
betty, you need
to calm down, okay?

234
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,600
i mean, go online to that--
that web site you like.

235
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
you know,
the one with the baby ducks

236
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,200
who think the cat's
their mother?

237
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,500
socuteitssick.com--
i love that web site.

238
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
except one of the baby ducks
is missing.

239
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,200
all right,
what is this guy's name?

240
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,300
i don't know.

241
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,600
something lame, like gio.

242
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,800
come back for what?

243
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,700
for a chance to run.

244
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,700
<i>hey, papi.
have you been watching?</i>

245
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,800
señor delgado's
in a lot of trouble.

246
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,000
do you think
they're gonna kill him?

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,300
let's hope not.
(gun cocks)

248
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,100
hey, did you book
your flight yet?

249
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,300
not yet. i just wanted
to call and say...

250
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,600
i love you all.

251
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,300
<i>ay. you're such
a nervous flyer.</i>

252
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,400
it's gonna be fine.
ooh, it is getting good.

253
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,700
okay, i'll talk to you later.
love you, bye.

254
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,200
you see? i'm not such a monster.
i let you say good-bye.

255
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,700
at least tell me
what you want.

256
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,900
who are you?
(door opens)

257
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,000
(man) i think you know
my father.

258
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,500
ramiro vasquez.

259
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,400
it seems you did not kill me
after all.

260
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,900
uh, no,
friday doesn't really help me.

261
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,300
i really need to get
the wheelchair here tonight.

262
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,400
well, this thing
can walk and talk.

263
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,600
can't you just stick it
on the turnpike

264
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,000
and give it money for tolls?
thank you.

265
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
okay,
so you don't get sarcasm.

266
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,500
could you please
just hold it for me,

267
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,400
and i-i promise
i will find a way to--

268
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,500
<i>well, you must be happy</i>

269
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,300
um, i'll call you back.
why?

270
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,200
i just got fired

271
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,700
<i>because you went crying
to your boss.</i>

272
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,200
now i don't have a job.

273
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
oh, man. i'm gonna have
to go back to stealing cable

274
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,800
from my neighbor,
which i don't feel right about,

275
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,700
all because
some little "mode" girl

276
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,300
wasn't happy
with her sandwich.

277
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,900
no, look, i wasn't trying
to get you fired. i was just--

278
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,900
yeah, well,
nonetheless, you did.

279
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,500
all right, everybody,
that's it for me,

280
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,000
but before i go,

281
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,700
there is no such thing
as fat-free mayo.

282
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,100
there's 125 calories of pure fat
per tablespoon,

283
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,800
<i>and i put two in every sandwich.</i>

284
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,600
ooh!

285
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,100
see you around,

286
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,200
"mode" girl.

287
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,300
(marc) nice, betty.

288
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,400
you're finally one of us.

289
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,000
no.

290
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,400
no, i'm not one of you.

293
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,500
wilhelmina, you didn't have
to go to this much trouble.

294
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,100
well, someone's gotta teach you
how to be a woman again.

295
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,200
(sighs) it's so frustrating.

296
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,000
it's like i finally got
the sports car i always wanted,

297
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,800
but i forgot
how torive a stick.

298
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
or maybe in this case,
it's more like an automatic.

299
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,400
don't worry. you're not going
through th alone.

300
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,000
i'm here. that's what
best friends are for.

301
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,800
it's so crazy. i can't
remember our friendship.

302
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,100
well, that's why
i brought this.

303
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,900
all right, all right.
girls, come on. off, off.

304
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,100
she's a tranny,
not a drag queen. let's go.

305
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,000
<i>(woman) dr. fishman
to radiology.</i>

306
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,900
i have pictures
of all kinds of fun

307
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,600
the two of us had
the past year.

308
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,900
maybe it'll jog your memory.

309
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,900
oh, here we are
at fashion week,

310
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,100
and that's my birthday.
you made me drink

311
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,200
something called
an irish car bomb.

312
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,300
mm. i had a hangover
for the first time in 20 years.

313
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,500
thank you very much.

314
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,000
sorry. i guess a bit of alex
must have slipped in there.

315
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
oh.

316
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,100
we square dance?

317
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,900
wow. i don't remember
any of this.

318
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,000
oh, uh, apparently,
we love to do-si-do.

319
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,700
and here we are...
marching for gay rights.

320
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,300
so are we...

321
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,100
no, no. just political.

322
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,400
i really have to go. i need
to check on your father.

323
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
i hope he's gotten
out of bed today.

324
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,000
well, what's wrong?
is he sick?

325
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,700
no, no, no. it's...
it's--it's nothing.

326
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,200
just forget
i said anything.

327
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,900
besides,
bradford would kill me.

328
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,200
wilhelmina,
you have to tell me.

329
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
i mean,
we're friends, right?

330
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,200
best friends.

331
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,000
god. i have missed
talking to you.

332
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,900
look, i'm really worried
about your father.

333
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,000
he's been devastated since
he postponed his wedding.

334
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,800
what?

335
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,300
he's getting married again?
to who?

336
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,000
to your...

337
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,300
best friend.

338
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,400
i'm actually kind of bummed
mr. meade's not my father.

339
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
i mean,
he is rich and bald.

340
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,000
(gasps)
your daddy warbucks fantasy.

341
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,800
i don't know
why that's so strong.

342
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,100
okay, can we forget and focus on your mother

343
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,300
and what being fey sommers'
daughter can get us?

344
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,100
and by "us," i mean you,
and by "you," i mean me.

345
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,800
think about it--
the invites, the swag.

346
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,100
(gasps) you are right.

347
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,600
i am freakin'
fey sommers' daughter.

348
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,500
and... genius idea.

349
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,100
your coming-out party

350
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,500
is tonight
at the black & white ball.

351
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,000
yay!
(gasps) it is?

352
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
it's perfect.
this was fey's big event.

353
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,600
every year, she would arrive
in some fabulous red gown

354
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,200
and utter her famous lines...

355
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,700
(imitates fey)
"black & white ball?

356
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,300
i guess
i didn't get the memo."

357
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,300
i can totally do that.

358
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,700
and when you arrive
holding her ugly mutt,

359
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,800
there will
be a media feeding frenzy,

360
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,100
and i will be right there
to feast on whatever scraps

361
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,200
are left after they're done
with your carcass.

362
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,100
nope. too angry.

363
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,300
calm down, henry.

364
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,400
(marc)
hey, grubstink!

365
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,300
grubstink!
we need our checks early.

366
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,700
yeah, i gotta buy me
a red dress, grubstank.

367
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,400
it's grubstick.

368
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,200
<i>(pounds desk)
grubstick. got it?</i>

369
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,600
it's one of the oldest
and most honored names

370
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,300
in dutch history,
which loosely translates to,

371
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,500
"he who gives the fairest price
for his bricks."

372
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,200
<i>the name is venerated, and i am
proud to be a grubstick.</i>

373
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,400
did he just get
really hot?

374
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,000
i've never been more attracted
to anyone in my life.

375
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,300
charlie, this is henry.

376
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,700
call me as soon as you get this.
we need to talk.

377
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,500
hey, justin.
how you doing?

378
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,400
okay.

379
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,900
been having kind of
a tough time lately, huh?

380
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
i guess.

381
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,200
do you know
how to play basketball?

382
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,100
sure.

383
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,000
back at harvard, they used to
call me dr. swish.

384
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,300
it's just
a basketball term.

385
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,500
why do you ask?

386
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,200
i want to learn how to play.

387
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,000
really? basketball?

388
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,700
my dad loved it.

389
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
this was his.

390
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,000
come on.

391
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,100
let's go shoot some hoops.

392
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,200
wait. sandwich guy!
oh, man.

393
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,400
gio! look, i'm sorry
about what happened today,

394
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,700
but i just finished talking
to your boss,

395
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,100
and you can
have your job back.

396
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,700
wow. that was...
that was nice of you.

397
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,700
see? i'm not a "mode" girl.

398
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,700
a "mode" girl
wouldn't have done that.

399
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,200
yeah, i guess not,
but that's okay.

400
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,500
i don't want it back.

401
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,700
why?

402
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,800
because losing that job

403
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,100
was exactly the kick
in the butt i needed.

404
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
it was taking me away
from my 5-year plan.

405
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,300
what's happening in five years?

406
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,300
to start my own place,
you know?

407
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,000
gio's sandwich depot.

408
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
300 seats, a thousand kinds
of sandwiches

409
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,300
and the world's longest
condiment bar.

410
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,900
you name it, it's on there.
go ahead. name one.

411
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,800
um... mustard?

412
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,200
of course there's gonna
be musrd there.

413
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,600
come on.
use your imagination.
sorry.

414
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,000
????

415
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,600
gio's could be huge.

416
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,100
look, i don't know why, but i
still feel kind of guilty

417
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,500
about getting you fired.

418
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,700
you don't have a job.

419
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,500
well...

420
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,900
something will turn up.

421
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,100
hey!

422
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,000
(betty) wait!

423
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,700
you have a van.
we need a van.

424
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,200
would you drive me to new jersey
to pick up a wheelchair?

425
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,000
we'd pay you.
sure, i could do that.

426
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,800
get in.

427
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,000
sauerkraut?

428
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,100
don't embarrass yourself.

429
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,500
my father left my mom for you?

430
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,900
oh, this memory loss
must be frustrating.

431
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,100
claire is the one
that left your father.

432
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,600
and you were right there to move in.

433
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,900
well, it--
it wasn't like that at all.

434
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,300
i was just trying
to be there for him--

435
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,900
a shoulder to lean on,

436
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,700
someone to bring him soup--

437
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,100
and i never could have predicted
that we'd fall in love,

438
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,200
but we did.

439
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,300
well, if he loves you so much,
why'd heall off the wedding?

440
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,600
because he loves you more.

441
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,100
with the accident and all,
he didn't want to upset you.

442
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,000
i just hope his...

443
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,500
his heart can take it.

444
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,700
wilhelmina, wait.

445
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,100
that was quite a beating you
gave me all those years ago.

446
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,100
<i>as i remember, it was to protect
rosa from one of your beatings.</i>

447
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,600
she was my wife.
i had the right.

448
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,100
<i>get your feet down,
you animal!
ay! aah!</i>

449
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,700
my cook ran away
with my wife.

450
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,500
you humiliated me.

451
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,900
the only thing that kept me
going through the years

452
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,500
was the hope that...
maybe one day...

453
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,200
i could have my revenge.

454
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,300
it seems
that day has come.

455
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,300
so you want me dead?

456
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,800
perhaps.

457
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,500
but right now,

458
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,900
i want my flan.

459
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,600
your flan?

460
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,700
your best dessert.

461
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,500
sometimes i wake up,
and i miss my wife.

462
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,600
sometimes i miss my flan.

463
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,100
you're insane.

464
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,200
no.

465
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,600
just hungry.

466
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,000
you'll make your flan...

467
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,500
maybe i spare your life.

468
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,800
remember that. all right,
you can do this. let's shoot.

469
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,700
but you're dribbling
with one hand, right? not two.
okay.

470
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,800
all right, so you wanna
step off with your left,

471
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,700
bounce it in with your right,
okay?

472
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,300
all right, one handed.

473
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,000
(man) oh, nice, nice.
okay, let's try again.

474
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,300
maybe lose the bracelets,
i don't know.

475
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,100
come on, justin.

476
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,400
we can do this.
you just gotta concentrate.

477
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,100
(daniel) one hand, justin.
(justin) i can't.

478
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,500
justin, you have
to visualize, okay?

479
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,600
okay, so line it up
and make the shot.

480
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,800
left foot.
(grunts)

481
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,900
no, no, no.
here, just watch me.

482
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,000
you can walk?

483
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,300
uh... basketball miracle.

484
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,000
take it, betty.

485
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,300
uh, mm...

486
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,800
(off- key) * t-the hurt
you caused when you walked *
ahem. that's a...

487
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,800
(turns off radio)
that's a really hard song
to sing.

488
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,400
so tell me,
if you're not a "mode" girl,

489
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,900
then why do you work there?
it's a great opportunity.

490
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,800
it's gonna open
a lot of doors for me.

491
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,300
i want to have
a magazine of my own one day.

492
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,500
ah. how--
how do you do that?

493
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,600
i'm an assistant now, but then
i want to be writing for one.

494
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,700
you're a writer?
mm-hmm.

495
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,300
that's cool.
what have you written?

496
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,700
a lo

497
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,900
actually, i practically ran
the queens college newspaper,

498
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,800
but since i've left,
the quality has gone way down.

499
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,100
no, i mean lately.

500
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,100
uh, well... (sighs)

501
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,700
nothing really, but i do
have a lot of ideas.

502
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,000
good.
keeping it all up there.

503
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,500
that's how hemingway did it.

504
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,300
he was thinking,
"what a nice morning,"

505
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,700
and "the sun also rises" just
magically appeared on the page.

506
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,700
are you making fun of me?

507
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,500
no, no, no. i'm sorry.
i just, you know,

508
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,200
i hope you're not
one of these people

509
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,900
who just waits
for things to happen.
no.

510
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,100
i mean, what are you,
like, 30 now?

511
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,400
i'm 23.

512
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,200
all right, you know what?
i can take care of myself.

513
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,400
how about you worry
about driving? okay?

514
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,500
(scoffs) you're faking it
to meet girls?

515
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,500
it's this one girl.
she's my new physical therapist.

516
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,700
she is just--
she's so totally...

517
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,200
smart.

518
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,200
look, we don't have
to tell your aunt betty, do we?

519
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,900
she already thinks
i'm a total screwup.

520
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,600
i promise i will have
a total recovery next week,

521
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,100
just as soon
as i've had one,

522
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,200
uh, really smart conversation
with her. deal?

523
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,700
you're kind of a dog.

524
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,100
i am.

525
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,100
you remind me of my dad.

526
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,400
now this machine has to come
back in pristine condition.

527
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
you got it? pristine.

528
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,100
how do i want it back?

529
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,800
don't worry.
it'll be perfect.

530
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,200
(quietly) i think he wanted you
to say "pristine."

531
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,400
pristine.

532
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
now just one second.

533
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,200
this...

534
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,000
this isn't
the ibot we reserved.

535
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,400
yeah. nick lachey's people
just called.

536
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,800
he twisted his ankle
in a gyrotonics class.

537
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,800
probably didn't stretc
anyway, we're giving it to him.

538
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,500
but... but...
my boss wanted the ibot.

539
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,800
yeah, sad story.
you're getting this one.
(cell phone rings)

540
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,000
hello?

541
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,100
but that's not fair.
(man) yeah.

542
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,700
we reserved the ibot.
we paid for it,

543
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,600
and he's giving us
the... tulip?

544
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,300
daniel can't ride
a tulip.

545
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,700
give him a good reason
to give it to you.

546
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,500
come on.
you're a writer.

547
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,400
make up a good story.

548
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
(man) we'll deliver it
tomorrow.

549
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
excuse me.

550
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,500
yeah,
i'll call you back.

551
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,300
sir?

552
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,600
um, look, i probably shouldn't
even be talking about this,

553
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,900
but my boss works
for the c.i.a.

554
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,900
yeah, and we really need
that chair.

555
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,600
how could he have believed
that crazy story?

556
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,700
'cause it was good.

557
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,200
well, i y have borrowed
a little of it

558
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,900
from "casino royale,"
but i did put my own spin on it.

559
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,200
hells yeah, you did.

560
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,000
you know, maybe you are
a writer after all.

561
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,900
thanks. maybe i am.

562
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,400
wait a minute.

563
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,100
is this real?

564
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,300
am i pinning
an endangered species here?

565
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,700
if you really want
to feel bad,

566
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,600
i have a hat
made of bald eagle.

567
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,100
(singsongy) guess who just
called bradford to her bedside.

568
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,400
took herong enough.

569
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,300
looks like she'll be giving
her blessing for this wedding

570
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,200
within the hour.

571
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,800
perfect. everything is going
according to my plan.

572
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,300
(gasps) soft.

573
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,000
oh! hard.
what was that for?

574
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,300
square dancing.

575
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,200
better than i remember.

576
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,400
kill him anyway.

577
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,800
this one almost went in,

578
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,000
but i touched something gross
on the pole.

579
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,700
wow, honey. good for you

580
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,200
so...
this basketball thing--

581
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
this is something
you're gonna be doing for, um,

582
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,000
a little while?

583
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,600
yeah. i like it,
and i think i'm getting better.

584
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,000
(glass shatters)
(justin) oh!

585
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
yeah, definitely.
i can see that.

586
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,900
wait a minute.
wait a minute.

587
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,800
i thought daniel was supposed
to be in a wheelchair.

588
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,300
daniel, it's betty again.

589
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,400
we got you your chair,
but it's almost 7:00,

590
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,700
so you're just gonna
have to meet us here.

591
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,000
and i've got
the lint roller,

592
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,500
so i'll just go over you
when you get here.

593
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,000
(laughs) man.

594
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,700
what?

595
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,000
you know, i think i know
the reason why you don't write.

596
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,500
you're too busy
de-linting your boss' ass.

597
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,300
see, no.
i didn't say the "a" word,

598
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,900
and my job
doesn't just consist

599
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,000
of silly little things
like that.

600
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,300
i have some very important
responsibilities.

601
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,700
excuse me. what is that?

602
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,500
that--the check
isn't supposed to be that big,

603
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,200
and we asked for it to be blue.

604
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,100
how is that gonna look
next to daniel's tiny pale head?
(laughs)

605
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,300
stop laughing at me.

606
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,200
and not that
it's any of your business,

607
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,900
but i will get back
to my writing.

608
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
(gio) i'm sure you will.
i will.

609
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,800
i just don't have
a lot of time right now

610
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,500
because i'm going through
some huge family problems.

611
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,300
quack.
excuse me?

612
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,500
every time you make an excuse,
i'm gonna quack.

613
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,300
you... you have no right
to quack.

614
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,600
you don't know my life.

615
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,800
my dad is stuck in mexico.

616
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,600
quack.
no, seriously,
and my sister's fiancé--

617
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,700
quack. quack.
will you just let me finish?

618
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
quack. all excuses.

619
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,000
the problem is
you don't have a plan.

620
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,700
you go through life--
woof!

621
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,400
what the hell is that?

622
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,500
well, if you're gonna quack,
then i'm gonna woof

623
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,900
every time you mention
your stupid plan.

624
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,700
quack.

625
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,000
no, quacking.
that wasn't an excuse.

626
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,700
yeah, well,
i changed the rules.

627
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,400
quack! quack!

628
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,600
woof! woof! woof!
woof! woof!
quack! quack! quack!

629
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,400
your phone's ringing.

630
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,900
woof! hello?

631
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,700

632
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,300

633
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,200
what's black and white
and rich all over?

634
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,800
why, the guests
at "mode's" black & white ball

635
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,400
benefiting the children's
hospital of blah, blah, blah,

636
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,200
like it matters.

637
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,300
let's talk about
what eva mendes is wearing.

638
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,600
forget eva mendes.

639
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,800

illegitimate daughter,

640
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,700

643
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,300

653
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,100
ugh. this is so unfair.

654
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,600
they took pictures
of the wrong bitch.

655
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,200
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.????

656
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,800
i was naive to think that the press
would automatically care.

657
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,000
you've got to work
for your celebrity.

658
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,500
does paris hilton have
everything handed to her?

659
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,000
well, actually, she does,

660
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,900
<i>but that celeb-utard
works hard to stay in the news.</i>

661
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,900
you're right. i have
to do something outrageous.

662
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,600
should i do skanky? 'cause i
could totally do skanky.

663
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,100
what if i just go pee
on the carpet?

664
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,100
oh, sweetie, courtney love did ???

665
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,700

666
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,900
out-britney britney.

667
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,100

668
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,700

670
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,400

00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,000

672
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,400

673
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,400

674
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,000
yeah. there you go.

675
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,100
michael bolton.
not the good one.

676
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,500
oh. how are you?
nice to meet you.

677
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,100
bradford meade,
you're engaged to him.
oh, darling. mm.

678
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,000
tell me, how's our alexis doing?
everything all right?

679
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,900
it seems someone
told her about us.

680
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,600
oh, i'm--i'm sorry.
i didn't want to,

681
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,700
but she's a smart girl,

682
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,600
even with some of
her brain missing.

683
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,900
it's all right.

684
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,400
she's now completely onboard
with the wedding.

685
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,500
she is?
that's wonderful!

686
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,600
yeah, i was surprised, too.

687
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,700
she's always been very close
to claire.

688
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,000
as long as you're not close
to claire. here.

689
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,900
(bradford)
i'm not wearing that thing.

690
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,200
this is a bad idea,
fish.

691
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,500
i have to see bradford.
it's the only way.

692
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,100
black & white ball, huh?

693
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,100
this looks like
an all-white ball to me.

694
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,300
come on.

695
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,600
oh!
this wheelchair is sexy!

696
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,500
not to mention, useful
for people who can't walk.

697
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,800
i mean, look at this.
this is so cool.

698
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,000
ooh, sorry.

699
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,800
sorry.

700
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,800
(laughs) this is great.

701
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,100
hey, daniel, thanks
for helping justin out today.

702
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,600
oh, he's a great kid, you know?
yeah! (laughs)

703
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,700
oh, sorry.
it must have been hard playing
basketball without your legs.

704
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,700
whoa. sorry.
how'd you manage?

705
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,800
yeah, no,
uh, justin was really good.

706
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,200
betty?

707
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,300
betty,
how do i stop this thing?
i don't know.

708
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,000
whoa!

709
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,700
(man) okay, i got it.

710
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,500
uh...

711
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,700
i forgot. the doctor called.
i can walk!

712
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,100
how could you?

713
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,700
betty, i'm sorry.
come on.

714
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,500
you know, i wasted my entire day
trying to get that stupid thing,

715
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,600
all so you could
play grab ass? that's right.

716
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
that just happened.
i said "ass."

717
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,100
i heard you.

718
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,900
do you have any idea what i could've been doing
with that time?

719
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,300
i could've written a short story
or--or a whole bunch

720
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,400
of short stories, depending on
how short they were.

721
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,500
or written in my journal,
because i'm pretty sure

722
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,000
my last entry went something
like, "i love lance bass.

723
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,100
i want to marry him."

724
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
i don't know
if you've heard--

725
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
yeah, i know!

726
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,700
hector, don't do this.

727
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,100
for 30 years, i thought
i killed your father.

728
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,400
it--it tortured me.

729
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
shut up.

730
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,500
don't become him.

731
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,000
you're not a monster.

732
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,500
he is the way he is
because of you.

733
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,800
that's not true.

734
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,000
hector, don't you remember?

735
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,500
you were 5 years old,

736
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,800
and rosa would--
would hide you in the kitchen

737
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,400
when your father
was drunk.

738
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,800
no, i don't remember.

739
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,600
<i>i'd make you arroz con leche
to keep you from crying,</i>

740
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,300
so he wouldn't hear you
and come in and hit you again.

741
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,000
stop it!

742
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
hector...

743
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,700
rosa cared for you
as if you were her own,

744
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,200
but we thought you'd be safe
with your mother.

745
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,100
stop it!

746
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,200
you weren't, were you?

747
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,200
hector, were you?

748
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,800
and speaking of honoring genius,

749
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,200
i'd also like
to take this moment

750
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,100
to thank one of the biggest
philanthropists

751
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,300
in all of fashion--

752
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,200
kenneth cole.

753
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,900
(kenneth) thank you, daniel.
thank you, everybody.

754
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,700
i am so honored to be here,

755
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:41,200
associated with such a worthy
and important cause.

756
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
(lowered voice)
what's this for again?

757
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,200
(whispers) uh,
new york children's hospital.

758
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,300
(normal voice) right.

759
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
thank you so much,
ladies and gentlemen.

760
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,500
are you remembering
to take your heart medicine?
claire?

761
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,000
oh, my god. you're all right.
where have you been?

762
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,300
she been with me, that's where
she been, and she is fine.

763
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,700
we got a life now.

764
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,600
yoga, really,
i'd like something chocolate.

765
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,800
it--it--
it's not what you think.

766
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,100
well, almost once.
claire, this is dangerous.

767
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,500
someone might see you.
i don't care.

768
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,700
bradford, come with me.
walk out that door right now.
don't do this.

769
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,100
please, just hear me out.

770
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,300
we can do this.
we can disappear.

771
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,800
we still have
those offshore accounts.

772
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,600
there's money to live on.
a fresh start--

773
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,800
new names, new lives.
for god sake, claire,
listen to yourself.

774
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,800
i know. i sound crazy.

775
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,000
after everything that's
happened, how could i not be?

776
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,900
but, please.

777
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,300
god, i love you,

778
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,400
and i know you love me.

779
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,500
(marc) my god, what that woman
will do for an open bar.

780
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,300
do you want me
to call the police

781
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,000
the police will
just put her back in jail.

782
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,500
i know
how to really hurt her.

783
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
i suffered

784
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,800
through your relationship
with fey for 20 years.

785
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,700
don't you owe this to me?

786
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,400
and now accepting our donation
to new york children's hospital,

787
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,900
our very own sheldon.

788
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,200
thank you.

789
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,300
the last year
has been really hard for--

790
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,200
isn't that inspirational?

791
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,400
friends,

792
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,800
i cannot wait another moment
to share this with you.

793
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,900
despite what you may have heard,

794
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
the bradford meade-
wilhelmina slater wedding

795
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,400
is back on.

796
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,800
bradford, darling,
where are you?

797
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,700
claire, your life is over.

798
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,800
it ended
the day that you murdered fey.

799
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,300
i'm sorry.

800
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,100
why isn't he dead?

801
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,700
i can't believe you haven't
done this yet. kill him.

802
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,200
hector.
kill him.

803
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,100
you're such
a disappointment as a son.
hector.

804
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,000
kill him!

805
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,200
hey.

806
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,400
i broughyou this.

807
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,600
there's a bite out of it.

808
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,500
okay, i didn't bring it for you,
i just thought of it.

809
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,400
the point is,
i'm very sorry, betty.

810
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,700
don't be.
i'm your assistant,

811
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,800
and it's my job to do
whatever you ask me to,

812
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,800
even if it is slightly offensive
to the handi-capable.

813
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,200
i think that my meltdown

814
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,700
had a lot more
to do with me than you.

815
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
i'm sorry.

816
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,500
so we're good.
that's great.

817
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,000
daniel, there's more.

818
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,800
look,
i appreciate this job,

819
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,800
but i can't lose track
of what i want.

820
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,000
are you quitting?
no, no, no.

821
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,800
i was just wondering, if you
don't need me during lunch,

822
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,000
i'm gonna enroll
in a writing class.

823
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,100
oh, i think that's great,
betty.

824
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:23,900
really?

825
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,600
yeah.

826
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,500
great.
i'm gonna be a writer.

827
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,400
good.

828
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,100
(woman) she's such a slut.
i love her.

829
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,800
i know. god.

830
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,600
the whole office
is talking about you.

831
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,500
i know they always do,

832
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,800
but now it's with envy
instead of pity and disgust.

833
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,800
and look! that's my foot
behind that guy. aah!

834
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,100
come on.
you were a hit last night.

835
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,500
oh, i know.

836
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,900
the swag, melissa etheridge
buying me a domestic beer,

837
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,300
appearing nude
in the tabloids--

838
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,100
i didn't think i'd have it
this together until i was 40.

839
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,800
but last night
when i was standing naked on the red carpet,

840
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,100
doing all those poses
those guys were shouting out,

841
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,900
i really had time to think,
and it hit me--

842
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,100
i'm never gonna get
to talk to my mother.

843
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,300
aw.
she's gone, and i have no idea
who my father is.

844
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,100
it's like i'm an orphan.

845
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,800
hey,
you are not an orphan.

846
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,700
you've got me...

847
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,500
and you've got halston,

848
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,800
and you've got that creepy guy
that saw your picture

849
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,000
and called and asked you to step
on his junk in your heels.

850
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,200
and that means a lot,
but i need something more.

851
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,000
what could be more important
than fame?

852
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,600
marc,

853
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,700
i need to find my father.

854
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,600
if i don't know where
i've come from,

855
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,700
how am i ever gonna know
who i am?

856
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,600
(clicks tongue) oh.

857
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,400
"tried it your way--
not terrible. gio."

858
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,200
betty, hi.

859
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,400
oh, hey.
hey.

860
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,600
how are you? i heard you had
some of hilda's hangover punch.

861
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,400
yeah, i did.
kind of worked.
hm.

862
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,300
um, anyway, listen,
i-i-i really need to apologize.

863
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,500
no, you don't have to.
but--

864
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,200
it's okay.
it's not okay. it's shabby
and disrespectful,

865
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,900
and i can only say
that i will never mix

866
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,900
wine coolers
and my antihistamine again.

867
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,900
that's probably
a good idea.

868
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,700
and i wanted you to know
that i talked to charlie,

869
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,300
and she admitted everything.

870
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,900
oh, um...

871
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,000
who's the father?

872
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,800
um, we're gonna do
a paternity test.

873
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,700
unfortunately, we can't do it
until her 14th week, so...

874
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,000
i guess
it looks like you and i

875
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,100
will just have to sit tight
and wait.

876
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,500
yeah, okay.

877
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,200
uh, then that's
what we'll do. we wait.

878
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,100
bye.

879
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,900
hey, uh,
do you want to get lunch?

880
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,800
uh, oh, i can't.

881
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,900
i, um, i have
something i have to do,

882
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,400
and it can't wait. not that i
don't want to, i do.

883
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,000
um, um, but i'll tell you
all about it later.

884
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,900
okay.
okay.

885
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,700
looks like
you got your lunch anyway.

886
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,700
someone get you a present?

887
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,700
um, n-no. uh,
that's just how they wrap it.

888
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,000
it's a fancy place.

889
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,300
(hilda) creative writing?

890
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,800
uh-huh. i was really nervous
about signing up,

891
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,800
but then i found my lucky
troll pen, and i thought,

892
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,300
hey, this is a good sign.

893
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,600
oh, betty,
you're gonna nail this.

894
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,700
i mean, look at the notes
you write me.

895
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,100
<i>they're always so fun.
mira.</i>

896
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,700
"hilda,
have a splendiferous day."

897
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,200
(laughs) that's imagination,
you know,

898
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,700
because i don't think
that's even a word.

899
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,300
anybody here?

900
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,400
<i>dad?
papi?</i>

901
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,900
(gasps)
aah! oh, my god!

902
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,000
what are you doing here?
oh, my g.
i can't believe you're home.

903
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,500
grandpa!
i thought you were
coming back tomorrow.

904
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,900
oh, are you starving?
you want something to eat?
no, no, no.

905
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,400
??????

906
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,700
