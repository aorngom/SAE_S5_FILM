1
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:13,830
Oh, hey, Betty.

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,400
Could you grab me my loofah?

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,340
What is that? I got it for Halston.

4
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,313
He's supposed to come anytime I ring it,
but he's kind of a bad doggy.

5
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:26,500
Not like you, Betty.

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,070
You're a good girl! No. No, don't do that.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:30,516
Look,

8
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:34,045
Amanda I'm really glad that you're getting so comfortable living here these past couple of weeks

9
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:37,574
really, I am, but I think it's time you and I

10
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:41,177
Have a talk about something that really has been bothering me.

11
00:00:41,177 --> 00:00:44,780
Is this about that $60 that you left out for anyone to take in your bottom drawer?

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,510
It's time to let that go, Betty.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,370
Amanda, you have this tendency to treat me like I'm your assistant.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,610
What? give me an example.

15
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,190
Well, for instance, you rang a bell to summon me.

16
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,699
You're constantly asking me to take your calls,

17
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,170
-Write down your messages  -oh, that reminds me.

18
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,560
What time's my massage tomorrow?

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,480
Oh, 6:30. amanda! oh.

20
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,910
No. look, I am an assistant all day long at work.

21
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,430
I don't want to come home and be an assistant here, too.

22
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,610
But you like your job.

23
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,430
Yes, I do.t is a wonderful stepping stone.

24
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:15,928
However,

25
00:01:15,928 --> 00:01:17,764
I don't think doing menial tasks for

26
00:01:17,764 --> 00:01:20,060
You is gonna help me get ahead in my career.

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:20,973
Hey, Betty,

28
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:24,050
Is it possible you're taking your career frustration out on me?

29
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,740
I don't think of you as an assistant. I really don't.

30
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,780
I think of you as a roommate, and sometimes a maid.

31
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,980
Would you grab me a coffee while you're up? that's not my job.

32
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,120
Good morning, Betty. could I get a cup of coffee?

33
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,980
Sure. that's my job.

34
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,800
Oh, Betty.

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,760
Nick pepper. what are you doing here?

36
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,980
Oh, you know, just visiting the old haunts.

37
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,088
I bet you've all been wondering what I've been doing since I left "mode.

38
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:52,880
you left "mode"?

39
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,590
Yeah, like two months ago, when alexis left?

40
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,300
Oh, right.

41
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,020
-We really missed you. -Anyway, crazy story.

42
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,277
I get one job interview, and the next thing you know,

43
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:05,660
I am deputy culture editor of the "new york review."

44
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,080
-Boo-yah! -What?

45
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,650
You're an editor? I know. can you believe it?

46
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,720
No. no.

47
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,320
Ah, isn't life funny?

48
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,100
No, but seriously, how are you guys? things going good?

49
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,850
Oh, yeah, marc got engaged, but then he got dumped.

50
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,500
It was sad. mandy.

51
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,690
Hold that thought, you guys. my assistant is texting me.

52
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,800
You have your own assistant? oh, yeah.

53
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,430
Hey, nick, just out of curiosity, how did you manage to get that job?

54
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,722
I mean, you weren't an assistant here for very long, and no offense,

55
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:36,243
But you weren't really that good at your job either.

56
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:38,320
Yeah, but I also graduated from y.e.t.i.

57
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,060
Last year.

58
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,630
Y.e.t.i.? young editors' training initiative.

59
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,820
It started a couple of years ago, uber-selective.

60
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,340
Nearly everyone from my class has gone on to become an editor.

61
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,632
So what, there's, like,

62
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:49,366
This magical school where assistants

63
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:51,340
Go to get turned into editors overnight?

64
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,850
One doesn't become a ninja overnight, Betty.

65
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,590
The hard part is getting in. you need a sponsor.

66
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,900
You gotta present a whole magazine concept to a bunch of judges.

67
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,480
But once you get in-- if u get in--boom.

68
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,710
I got my brass ring, and I am running with it, baby.

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,350
Talk to me. nick pepper, deputy culture editor.

70
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,280
Oh! daniel, great news.

71
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,417
You get to be my sponsor for y.e.t.i.

72
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,910
the young editors' training initiative.

73
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,950
Great. uh, what does a sponsor do?

74
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,840
Just write a letter about how great I am.

75
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,430
Try and keep it under a page if you can.

76
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,210
Thanks, daniel. this means so much to me.

77
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,110
Um, okay.

78
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,350
Oh, gross. look who's here.

79
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,570
Wilhelmina, good morning.

80
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,590
Look who's here.

81
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,480
How are you?

82
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,279
Very well, thank you.

83
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:51,280
And look at you, with your hair all up and everything.

84
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,720
Aren't you coltish?

85
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,050
-Molly was just dropping me off. -I've gotta run.

86
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,260
We're doing a big thanksgiving thing at school today.

87
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,820
I have a native american from the poospatuck tribe coming to speak.

88
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,740
Mm, the life you lead.

89
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,370
Well, it's always good to see you. likewise.

90
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,410
We'll have to do brunch. really?

91
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,520
I'd rather gouge my eyes out.

92
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,451
I will shoot you in the heart before I'll let you brunch with her?

93
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:18,720
I mean, she's a mousy schoolteacher.

94
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:25,222
And he is ambitis, he's shrewd, he's competitive, he's hot, he's...

95
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:26,200
He's me.

96
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,160
He's the me-a-mina.

97
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,230
Well, why can't he see we'd make the perfect couple together?

98
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,540
Maybe you need to spend more time with him, you know, one-on-one.

99
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,480
Well, I do have that advertisers' meeting in florida.

100
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,630
Maybe I could invite him. he could see me in action.

101
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,170
Maybe he can see you in your underwear as well.

102
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,250
Marc.

103
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,380
It's not about the sex.

104
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,850
I can see a future with him.

105
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,600
And he could, too, with, me.

106
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,490
If he'd just get to know me, he'd see that we're the same.

107
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,030
Okay, but if that doesn't work, you could always wah-wah.

108
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,850
'cause you've still got it, lady.

109
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,060
Well, it's always good to have a plan "b."

110
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,650
Or a plan 34-c. uh-huh.

111
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,110
Here at y.e.t.i.,

112
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,480
we see people as more than just assistants.

113
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,660
We see you as the future leaders of the publishing industry.

114
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,640
Gosh, I feel like I'm dreaming.

115
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,360
This is exactly the opportunity that I've been looking for.

116
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,110
So here are your guidelines for your presentation.

117
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,460
You have to create a cover,

118
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,947
A table of contents and a letter from the editor for

119
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:01,530
An original magazine concept that best describes you.

120
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,980
Oh, this application is for next year. I'm looking for this year.

121
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,080
The deadline for this year is just too tight.

122
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,920
Oh. well, I can't wait another year.

123
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,380
This is my future. I need to start my future, pilar.

124
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,270
My boss works under deadlines all the time.

125
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,770
I've done it before. I can do it.

126
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,800
I hope y're right. you are adorable.

127
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,460
Thank you.

128
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,140
Oh, and so how tight is my deadline?

129
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,850
Like a month, a couple weeks?

130
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,440
You have 48 hours.

131
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,310
To create a magazine?

132
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,200
Good luck.

133
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:43,788


134
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:49,788


135
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:51,788
Y.E.T.I.

136
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,800
Dad, please, you made the posole.

137
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,230
You don't have to clean up, too.

138
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,290
Mija, you just stay right there and keep working.

139
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,924
We want you to get into this y.e.t.i.

140
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,190
I don't know how they expect you to come up with a magazine in two days.

141
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,870
Well, luckily I know exactly what a fashion magazine is supposed to look like.

142
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,920
You're doing a fashion magazine?

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,710
What? well, stop looking at me. dad.

144
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,197
Sweetheart,

145
00:07:16,197 --> 00:07:19,850
I thought the assignment was to do a magazine that expresses who you are.

146
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,142
It is.

147
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:24,579
It is, and--and I have a million ideas that I want to do,

148
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:29,060
But they're all too big, and I don't have time, so I'm being practical.

149
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,520
I have the resources at "mode" to do a fashion magazine.

150
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,360
It just has to get me in. oh, I guess that makes sense.

151
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,136
You get your foot in the door,

152
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:40,708
And then you're on your way to doing your not-fashion magazine.

153
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:41,710
okay, mom.We have to go.

154
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,380
Randy's coming over to watch "little shop of horrors."

155
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,003
The high school doing the play tomorrow,

156
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:48,684
And randy thinks that he can see the play without seeing the movie.

157
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:49,050
I know.

158
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,666
Crazy, right?

159
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,702
Okay, please through out the garbage, and we'll meet you downstairs.

160
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:54,340
Betty needs to get back to work.

161
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,270
You, too. all right. god.

162
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,130
Hey, so justin's spending a lot of time with randy, huh?

163
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,347
Yeah. it's been great.

164
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:05,177
You know, they hang out all the time you know, ever since santos died,

165
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:08,340
Justin really hasn't had any male presence in his life.

166
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,050
Hello? I'm right here.

167
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,690
You know what I mean. bye. mwah.

168
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,950
Love you. love you.

169
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,990
Betty, you're getting in. I know it.

170
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,550
>lo siento aqu?

171
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,550
Well, I hope you're right.

172
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,100
Papi, this could be the fast track to everything I ever wanted.

173
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,130
Fashion.

174
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,210
Connor, hi.

175
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,360
Hi. listen, are you familiar with doral resort wear?

176
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,610
As in the largest resort wear label in the country?

177
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,970
That's the one.

178
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:55,370
Well, they are interested in exclusive back cover  spots through 2012.

179
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,450
That's huge.

180
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,550
Well, we just have to persuade them to jump ship from "elle,"

181
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,530
And they can only meet tomorrow.

182
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,250
So, uh, will you join me for the meeting?

183
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,460
I'm supposed to speak at molly's school in the morning.

184
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,650
Can we schedule it for the afternoon? oh, I forgot to tell you.

185
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,900
Doral's corporate offices are in key largo, florida.

186
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,100
Uh, so you and I are going on a little trip.

187
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,420
Right. okay, betty, which one of these vests do you want for your cover?

188
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,630
Um, I like the spotted one.

189
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,500
Really?

190
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,610
Well, I don't know. the... the blue one?

191
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,060
Or I mean, does it even need a vest?

192
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,040
Maybe a blazer or a bolero.

193
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,390
Well, betty, now you're just saying words at me.

194
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,750
I just--i can't wrap my head around this letter from the editor.

195
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,970
Betty, how hard can it be? daniel does it. what do I do?

196
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,420
What don't you do?

197
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,050
Thank you. christina, would you sign this out?

198
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,600
I'm not really feeling the red tie today.

199
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,470
What is all this?

200
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,320
Oh, uh, we're working on my magazine for y.e.t.i.

201
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,890
So you're doing a fashion magazine?

202
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,090
Mm-hmm. why?

203
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,910
Great. yeah, so... carry on.

204
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,430
Christina, am I on the wrong track? no. no, no, no, no, no.

205
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,220
Right now. come on. concentrate, missy.

206
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,480
Which of these vests do you want for the cover?

207
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,540
That one?

208
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,190
Yes! that's my girl. all right!

209
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,090
It's easy.

210
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,280
So what do you think so far? I like it.

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,110
You know, the guy who plays the dentist is really good for high school.

212
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,100
You're as good as him. you could totally play that part.

213
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,570
You think so? mm-hmm.

214
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,750
Randy.

215
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,790
Hey, man, what's up? what's up, man?

216
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,700
What are you doing here? just watching the show.

217
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,890
Oh, the one about the singing plant? yeah.

218
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,830
It's pretty lame, dude. skip the rest. let's hang out. are you insane?

219
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,290
They haven't even done "suddenly seymour" yet. wait.

220
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,820
You guys are watching the show together?

221
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,700
Mm-hmm.

222
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,320
Okay, man. well, have fun.

223
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,640
See ya. well, some people enjoy a musical, thank you very much.

224
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,520
Come on. let's go back inside.

225
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,050
Okay. betty, this is it. I think we've got it-- the winning look.

226
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,440
Christina... yes!

227
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,290
It's great.

228
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh, I think my cover is gonna be amazing.

229
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,730
God, that took a really long time.

230
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,929
I guess choosing this stuff doesn't really come natural to anybody.

231
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:32,950
Okay, write this down.

232
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,452
I need the elie tahari, mm, this dusty rose dior,

233
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:40,374
Whatever this fabulous thing is, and, oh,

234
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:43,370
You know what would be gorge with this?

235
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,220
Those amethyst drop earrings by pippa small. ooh.

236
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,060
Mm. we're signing all of this out. thank you. for what?

237
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,420
Marc's y.e.t.i. presentation.

238
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,300
What? marc, wait! marc!

239
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,490
You're applying to y.e.t.i.? I didn't know that.

240
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,960
Well, you know me. I like to keep a low profile.

241
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,480
I'm applying to y.e.t.i., too.

242
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,480
Really? you're my competition?

243
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,590
What's your magazine? what's your vision?

244
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,350
Um... betty's doing a fashion magazine.

245
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,440
Really? oh, my god. brilliant.

246
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,530
I'm as good as in. betty, you know fashion means clothing, right?

247
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,540
Betty's magazine is gonna kick your magazine's ass.

248
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,300
Oh, really? what's it called, "clashing patterns digest"?

249
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,600
Okay, okay. all right. no need to be so snarky.

250
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,410
We could both get in.

251
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,500
Actually, that's where you're wrong, betty.

252
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,690
Y.e.t.i. never takes two people from the same magazine.

253
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,600
Really?

254
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,780
Yep. so when it's this... against this...

255
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,870
In the fashion world, I think you know who the winner is.

256
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,940
Good luck.

257
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,440
Oh, there's my baby boy.

258
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,440
I thought we talked about that.

259
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,540
Oh, right.

260
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,330
There's my big strong man.

261
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,390
How was the play?

262
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,530
You know, you'd think I'd be tired of seeing "little shop," after, like,

263
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,350
14 times, but you'd be wrong.

264
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,640
And how about Randy?

265
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,470
Um, he liked it... I think.

266
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,130
He had to go home right after.

267
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:19,240
Mm. do you think Randy would like to go with you to a broadway show?

268
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,950
"In the Heights,"

269
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,490
Winner of the 2008 tony for best musical? mm-hmm.

270
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,250
Third row orchestra? mom, I'm goin' blind.

271
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,092
All right, all right. don't go blind. just have fun.

272
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,092
Randy's gonna flip.

273
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,900
Mwah. thank you.

274
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,430
All right. I love you. love you.

275
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,460
Justin, slow down.

276
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,210
Mija, what a surprise.

277
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,410
Mm. papi, I need a pan of your capirotada and a spoon.

278
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,610
Two spoons. I need one going at all times.

279
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,080
Uh-oh. two spoons. never a good sign.

280
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,752
Did you finish your presentation?

281
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,342
No, I quit.

282
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,880
I can't do a fashion magazine.

283
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,630
Told you so!

284
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,700
Not helping!

285
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,660
And now I have to wait another year to apply to Y.E.T.I.

286
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,990
I was just kidding myself. It wasn't me.

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,380
Sweetheart, that's the problem.

288
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,872
Wasn't the assignment to do a magazine that shows who you are?

289
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,482
-Yeah.

290
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,550
-Well, do that. -Dad, there isn't any time.

291
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,620
Of course there is.

292
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,900
When you are passionate, you can do anything.

293
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,230
Remember when your mother was in the hospital the first time?

294
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,270
You wanted her to know everything you guys were doing, so you made...

295
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,100
A magazine for her. remember?  oh!

296
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,700
Oh, you saved "the betty review"? oh!

297
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,440
I save everything you girls do. oh!

298
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,740
Look at this--articles,

299
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,010
Pictures of all the things that are important to you.

300
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,210
Look at my hair! I looked so good.

301
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,990
And as I remember,

302
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,772
You were able to make this whole magazine in one afternoon

303
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,250
because it mattered to you. oh.

304
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,480
So why don't you just give them this?

305
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,572
This? you're not helping.

306
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,202
No, wait. that does help. that does help.

307
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,050
Hilda, thank you. papi, thank you.

308
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,742
Okay, I'm going back to work now.

309
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,022
Work? there's nobody at work.

310
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,870
-Doesn't matter. -What about the capirotada?

311
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,900
I'll eat it later.

312
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,420
Morning, daniel.

313
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,250
Got your phone sheet, your schedule and your coffee.

314
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,750
Might have had a few cups myself.

315
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,240
Uh, is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday? good eye.

316
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,100
Good eye. yeah.

317
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,090
I stayed up all night working on my Y.E.T.I.

318
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,360
Application, but I finished,

319
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,692
And I was wondering if you could maybe take a look at it,

320
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,532
you know, like a dry run sort of thing?

321
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,912
it would mean a lot to me,'cause your opinion matters.

322
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,622
uh, sure. but I haven't even sat down yet.

323
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,780
Right, right, right, right, right.

324
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,240
Well, you know, settle in, take your time,

325
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,460
But just not too much time 'cause my presentation's at 2:00.

326
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,730
-Man, I had a lot of coffee. -You okay?

327
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,582
Borderline, on the edge-- the good side of the edge--

328
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,572
So don't you worry about me.

329
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,962
Hey, did you finish my letter of recommendation?

330
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,080
Uh, no, not just yet.

331
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,600
-You forgot?  -No, I didn't forget. just...

332
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,940
You know, if you're anxious about it, maybe you should write the letter,

333
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,520
And that way, I could sign it.

334
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,850
You can write whatever you want, make yourself sound great.

335
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,920
Daniel, have you got a second?

336
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,760
Uh, yeah, sure. thanks, Betty.

337
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,700
So Wilhelmina and I are about to head off to Florida.

338
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,230
Oh, right, the doral account.

339
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,542
Good luck with that. you'll definitely need it.

340
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,612
thanks. yeah.

341
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,850
Anyway, uh, I'm in a world of trouble with Molly.

342
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,590
I promised her I'd talk to her class today about the magazine business.

343
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,860
Now feel free to say no to this, but...

344
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,320
You want me to talk to Molly's class?

345
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,530
I know she'd really appreciate it, and I know you think she's great.

346
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,120
No, I don't.

347
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,112
-What? -no, uh, I like her,

348
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,470
but I don't like her like you like her

349
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,300
Uh, I'd love to talk to her class.

350
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,640
Great. all right. I'll get you the details.

351
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,090
Thanks for going for me, mate.

352
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,030
Yeah.

353
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,350
Daniel, are you going out of the office?

354
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,460
Uh, when do you think we can do the dry run of my presentation?

355
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,450
Oh, I'm not gonna be gone long, hour, tops.

356
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,190
You got something in your hair.

357
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,350
Oh. I was looking for that.

358
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,390
If I get called out there and I don't make it back...

359
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,160
I want you to know, you have been an excellent teammate, Sherman.

360
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:32,140
Red rover, red rover, send daniel right over.

361
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,660
Okay. okay, everyone.

362
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,910
Everyone, quietly, quietly get in line for potty break and juice.

363
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,440
Go with miss Haskell, quietly in line.

364
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,190
Great call with the red rover.

365
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,760
I knew I was in trouble when I asked them who wanted

366
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,230
To be an editor when they grow up, and little Emmy said...

367
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,540
"um, I want to be a dancer/monkey/ chinese person."

368
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,120
So you're good with kids.

369
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,390
Yeah, well, it's definitely something I've been thinking about lately,

370
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,080
You know, starting a family.

371
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,140
-Oh, come on. what?   -No. nothing.

372
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,480
You are just not the Daniel Meade that you read about in the tabloids.

373
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,730
Well, I'm just full of surprises. mm.

374
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,500
So what's next? um, finger painting?

375
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,190
macaroni art?

376
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,800
Hey, if you got the time, I got the pasta.

377
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
I guess that's that.

378
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,010
I've been an aistant to the editor-in-chief at

379
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,560
"mode" magazine for two years now, and I love my job there.

380
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,910
But as we all know,

381
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,180
The goal of a fashion magazine is to create

382
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,820
And sell an image that women will want to become.

383
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,010
I have imagined a magazine that celebrates what women already are...

384
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:35,528
A magazine for the young woman looking to

385
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:38,690
Be inspired beyond celebrities and clothing.

386
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,930
Sounds like my daughter.

387
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,520
Well, then your daughter might be interested in reading...

388
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,310
"b magazine," a lifestyle magazine for young women.

389
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:55,749
This magazine says that it's okay to get involved, to use your mind,

390
00:19:55,749 --> 00:20:00,280
Be thoughtful, be confident, be yourself.

391
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,540
"b magazine."

392
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,700
Nice, miss suarez.

393
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,880
Let's hear your letter from the editor.

394
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,610
Okay, okay, okay.

395
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,610
So how did it go?

396
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,100
I think I nailed it.

397
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,110
Yay! she nailed it! yes! my daughter!

398
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,450
Shh, shh, dad. she's my daughter. this is my daughter.

399
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,690
Dad, dad, shh.

400
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,980
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

401
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,607
Andre, heather, emily,

402
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:57,050
Sven-- would you mind setting up the powerpoint screen in there, please?

403
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,790
Thank you so much. you're the best.

404
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,450
Marc.

405
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,480
You brought a team.

406
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,170
Oh, just some of the interns from "mode"

407
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,260
Helping out with the heavy lifting. no big whoop.

408
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,720
"a-list" magazine-- for all things fashion, fabulous and famous.

409
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,260
See that? all fluff.

410
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,550
-You showed 'em you were smart.  -A celebrity magazine?

411
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,160
I mean, hasn't that been done?

412
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,225
Well, instead of just exploiting the celebrity culture,

413
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:27,820
I'm commenting on it, ruminating on america's obsession with fame.

414
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,210
Why can't we get enough?

415
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,500
-That sounds kind of smart.  -I know.

416
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,477
Actually, david sedaris wrote a really great feature for us about--well,

417
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:37,490
You know what? why don't you just take a look?

418
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:43,980
-You can keep that.  -Wait. you did an entire magazine?

419
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,140
Marc, sorry we're late.

420
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,760
There they are.

421
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,495
Suares, you're familiar with the super chic,

422
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:53,470
Iconic stylings of fashion house badgley mischka.

423
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,340
Meet mark badgley and james mischka.

424
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,930
Marc's y.e.t.i. sponsors. uh!

425
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,970
We read your magazine. it's so sharp.

426
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,440
-It's right on the money.  -Where has wilhelmina been hiding you?

427
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,140
Oh, mark, james.

428
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,230
-Marc st. james?  -Yes.

429
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,920
-francesca.  -james!

430
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,800
I didn't know you were a judge for this.

431
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,710
-You're gonna love our friend marc.  -Come in.

432
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,610
Yes. we're eager to see your presentation.

433
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,430
Thank you.

434
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,240
There's my favorite girl.

435
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,830
Hey,are you applying to y.e.t.i. again?

436
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,010
I don't know.

437
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,000
Daniel, I've applied for 49 years in a row.

438
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,770
Maybe if you finally gave me that letter of recommendation...

439
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,350
Oh, come on, betty. don't be such a nag.

440
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,920
Hey, would you mind grabbing me a cup of coffee?

441
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,140
That's my job.

442
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,390
Don't run now.

443
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,070
Wouldn't want you to hurt yourself...

444
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,190
Because you're gonna be my assistant until your dying day.

445
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,240
You're my betty.

446
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,120
Betty.

447
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,330
Sorry I'm late. I lost track of time.

448
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,090
I'm ready to help you with your y.e.t.i. thing.

449
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,880
Oh. excuse me.

450
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,770
"you missed it"?

451
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,420
Betty, why are you texting me?

452
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,200
"can't talk to you right now!!!"

453
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,000
Hmm. all capitals, one, two, three exclamation points.

454
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,940
Okay, I get it. you're mad at me.

455
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,250
Look, I feel terrible.

456
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,920
Is there something I can do, someone I can talk to for you?

457
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,010
"too late." happy face?

458
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,570
-That's supposed to be an unhappy face.  -Ha! I got you to talk.

459
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,570
You can't go back now.

460
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,140
I'm shutting my phone off. listen to me.

461
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,410
Betty, I am sorry.

462
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,560
Whatever, daniel.

463
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,490
Recommendation letter, dry run-- none of it would have helped.

464
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,240
I'm not getting into y.e.t.i.

465
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,180
Daniel meade's office. how can I help you?

466
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,020
Yes, this is betty.

467
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,530
What?

468
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,310
Wait. I got in? I got into y.e.t.i.?

469
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,350
That's amazing!

470
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,270
Yes!

471
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,190
All right!

472
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,680
That's so great! should I come down there?

473
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,190
You were brilliant. ah.

474
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,057
You got that guy to lock in the premium rate for the

475
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:55,200
Next five years and make him think that it was his idea.

476
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,360
I thought I was pushing it.

477
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,160
Well, sometimes people want to be pushed a little.

478
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,740
You were magnificent.

479
00:25:02,741 --> 00:25:05,141
Well, we certainly do make for a well-oiled machine

480
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,240
Yes, we do. so shall we go out and celebrate?

481
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,260
Yes. absolutely.

482
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,240
Although the restaurant we passed on the way in

483
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,400
Had a sign in front that says, uh, "we've got crabs."

484
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,110
Hmm. okay, what do you suggest?

485
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,870
Well, believe it or not, this hotel is the best place in town.

486
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,380
Maybe we could, um, order room service, a bottle of wine?

487
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,470
Sounds great.

488
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,330
Yes, it does...

489
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,340
Doesn't it?

490
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,464
Okay,

491
00:25:44,464 --> 00:25:46,813
So you are never gonna guess where we are

492
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:49,850
Going tomorrow night-- "in the heights" on broadway.

493
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,620
Okay. you're speechless.

494
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,080
I was, too, but hello! four tonys, two tickets.

495
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,880
Um, I can't go. I'm busy.

496
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,095
Well, you're gonna have to cancel whatever you're doing,

497
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:08,105
Because you don't even understand how great these seats are.

498
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:09,967
-Look, justin, I don't--  -What?

499
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:11,830
I don't think we should hang out anymore.

500
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,720
Why? is there something wrong?

501
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,985
Dude, stop following me around.

502
00:26:20,985 --> 00:26:23,140
It's pathetic. get a life.

503
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,130
See you in dance class.

504
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,690
Oh, man, what a loser.

505
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,850
Hi, marc.

506
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,802
Marc, isn't in right now, but if you leave your name and number,

507
00:26:41,803 --> 00:26:42,867
He'll never speak toou again

508
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:46,360
you odious sea cow, betty. beep.

509
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,900
Okay.

510
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,880
Obviously you got your y.e.t.i. news.

511
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,330
Look, I know you must be disappointed

512
00:26:53,331 --> 00:26:55,662
but for whatever it's worth,

513
00:26:55,662 --> 00:26:57,790
I really liked your presentation.

514
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,610
It was really good.

515
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,580
Only about a thousand times better than yours.

516
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,150
Okay, well, I don't know about that.

517
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,782
Look, maybe the judges just saw how much I wanted it, you know,

518
00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:09,330
How much I want to be an editor.

519
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,380
Mm-hmm. you're right, because I don't want to be an editor.

520
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,650
I didn't go to f.i.t.

521
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,743
Or spend a summer abroad studying menswear in milan

522
00:27:15,743 --> 00:27:19,044
Or spend the last four years of my life slaving for the

523
00:27:19,044 --> 00:27:21,285
Best creative director in the industry,

524
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:25,590
Who doesn't even know and wouldn't even care that I applied to y.e.t.i.

525
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,880
Okay, well, clearly you wanted it.

526
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,097
Look, maybe they just liked my concept better or, you know,

527
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:39,980
Who knows why they would pick me. i-- yeah, okay.

528
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,630
What? nothing. forget it.

529
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,760
No. what, marc?

530
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,077
You really think that what you did in two days

531
00:27:47,077 --> 00:27:49,920
Is better than what I spent three months working on?

532
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,240
Y-y-you're really gonna make me say it?

533
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,200
Say what?

534
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,490
You helped them meet their quota.

535
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,480
What are you talking about?

536
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,540
I mean, they picked you, betty suarez of queens, becausyou're latina.

537
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,550
You're the token ethnic girl.

538
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,460
Wha-- what? n-- they picked me...

539
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,370
That doesn't even...

540
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,490
Wow, marc.

541
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,950
You have said a lot of really ugly things to me in the past,

542
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,840
But that is by far and away the ugliest.

543
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,370
Well, I'm sorry, betty.

544
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,490
It may be ugly, but it's the truth.

545
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,240
Surprise! surprise! you're in the y.e.t.i.

546
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,900
Guys, guys, guys, guys, no.

547
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,260
No, no. it's not really a good time right now. what?

548
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,850
Bui brought the capirotada. yeah!

549
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,860
Yay, betty! she did it. ow!

550
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,750
God!

551
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,530
Guys, I don't feel like celebrating right now.

552
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,020
Why? what--what-- what's wrong, mija?

553
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,299
Marc told me that the only reason y.e.t.i.

554
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,740
Accepted me is because I'm latina.

555
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,630
What? sounds like sour grapes to me.

556
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:26,440
Yeah. yeah, well, I called, and they didn't exactly deny it.

557
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,420
Who cares why you got in? you got in.

558
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,010
I care. look, you gotta take every advantage you get in this life.

559
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:36,294
When I have to go to the butcher shop, I put on my tightest tank top,

560
00:29:36,294 --> 00:29:38,550
And thank you to the pointer sisters right here,

561
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,438
Abundio the meat man--

562
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,650
Is that fair? no. so what?

563
00:29:42,651 --> 00:29:44,350
who cares? I don't care. thank you

564
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:45,830
I can never show my face in that butcher shop again.

565
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,170
Please. betty, it doesn't matter.

566
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,229
When your mom and I came to this country,

567
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:51,160
We wanted to start a better life.

568
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:53,800
oh, here goes the young immigrant story.

569
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,772
All over the city, I looked for woras a chef, but nobody would hire me.

570
00:29:56,772 --> 00:29:57,967
One guy told me flat out,

571
00:29:57,968 --> 00:29:59,490
"puerto ricans don't touch the food.

572
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,220
You can wash the dishes."

573
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,390
I said, "i'm not puerto rican. I'm a maxican.

574
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,580
Know what he said to me? "even worse."

575
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,576
papi, look, i-- all I'm saying is,

576
00:30:09,576 --> 00:30:13,570
If being mexican helped this time, then good. take it.

577
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,510
No, papi.

578
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,940
I wanted to be accepted because I earned it.

579
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,750
You did.

580
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,400
So, wil... yes?

581
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,446
Tell me, no mann your life,

582
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:34,210
or are men just disposable to you?

583
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,450
Well, yes, there's been men, but, uh... what?

584
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:45,300
Well, it sounds awful, but they've all been such terrible disappointments.

585
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,813
Well£¬I've seeyou in action,

586
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:52,190
and you are a very formidable woman.

587
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,520
I'm sure they find it hard to keep up.

588
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:00,610
So molly--um, she teaches children how to color?

589
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,730
Yeah, she's great.

590
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,650
Molly--she's, um, very free-spirited, very forthright.

591
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,370
You always know exactly what she's thinking.

592
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,410
Yes, yes, yes.

593
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,130
I met her. she's a peach.

594
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,304
But a schoolteacher doesn't seem like a

595
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:18,020
Natural fit for a powerful business mind as yourself.

596
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,661
Well, I guess at first,

597
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:26,310
It was the differences that were challenging and exciting.

598
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,850
It was an aphrodisiac-- opposites being drawn together.

599
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,090
And, uh, now?

600
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,930
And now...

601
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,740
We're engaged.

602
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,530
Let's, uh, have some more wine, shall we?

603
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,460
Justin, easy on the door. leave me alone.

604
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:01,990
Excuse me.

605
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,742
Lose the attitude or you're not going to "in the heights" tomorrow.

606
00:32:05,742 --> 00:32:07,050
I'm not going anyway.

607
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,140
Justin, what happened? why are you so upset?

608
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,880
Randy doesn't want to be friends anymore. why not?

609
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,130
I don't know, mom. I don't know.

610
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,950
But I'm not going to the stupid show.

611
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,920
Justin, I'm sure that randy did not mom.

612
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,900
Please stop. I don't want to talk about it.

613
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,680
"dear, daniel, thanks for coming to our class.

614
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,320
You are old."

615
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,260
Hello.

616
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,880
Oh, hey. uh, it's daniel. um...

617
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,670
Just got your thank-you notes.

618
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,370
Just calling to, um, thank you for those.

619
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,780
You're thanking me for thank-you notes?

620
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,370
It's kind of weird. I'm sorry.

621
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,760
Um, i-i didn't mean to bother you.

622
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,990
You're not bothering me.

623
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,787
It's nice to talk to a grown-up.

624
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,968
Connor's still in florida, so I'm working late tonight.

625
00:33:20,968 --> 00:33:25,150
By the way, the macaroni earrings you made are surprisingly wearable.

626
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,570
Why is it that I'm stonkered and you're fine?

627
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,460
Well, I guess I can hold my liquor better than you.

628
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,930
You know, wil, I disagree with everybody at the office.

629
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,180
I think you're great.

630
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,460
Oh, that reminds me of boarding school.

631
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,310
We used to play spin the bottle.

632
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,320
That sounds like a dangerous game.

633
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,000
Well, no, it's harmless.

634
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,820
Of course never wanted the bottle to land on me.

635
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:11,250
I was, uh, always afraid of just what might happen.

636
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:16,880
You are very hard to resist.

637
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,030
Well, then stop resisting.

638
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,580
No.

639
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:23,480
Stop.

640
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,580
Wilhelmina, I'm engaged.

641
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,940
You need to stop what you're doing and accept that.

642
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,620
Here. you're in.

643
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,420
What?

644
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,600
You were right.

645
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,590
Your presentation was better. so I dropped out, and you're in.

646
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,260
Betty, are you crazy?

647
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,060
I have been discriminated against my whole life.

648
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,540
If I was given an advantage like you, I would take it and run with it.

649
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,040
Marc, you're a gay man in the fashion industry.

650
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,720
You have plenty of advantages.

651
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,490
That gets me nothing.

652
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,950
Madonna--tickets, backstage passes.

653
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,920
Thanks, bitch.

654
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,850
Okay, but outside the fashion world, it's a different story.

655
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,160
Look, marc, at the end of the day, you deserved it more.

656
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,100
-And I could just... apply next year. -I-I...

657
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,970
Marc, just--please, before I change my mind.

658
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,290
Okay.

659
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,430
I'm sorry for the things that I said yesterday.

660
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,890
I hope you don't think I'm a racist.

661
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,660
Just so you know,

662
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,260
Some of the hottest guys I've ever dated have been Latino.

663
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,760
You're welcome.

664
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,250
Thank you.

665
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:12,330
You know, you might feel better if you just tell me what happened.

666
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,730
I don't know.

667
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,070
I'm on your side.

668
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,900
Well, one minute Randy's my best friend,

669
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:33,170
and... now he-- he hates me.

670
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,180
That's not possible.

671
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,310
No, it is...

672
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,090
Because... I don't fit in with his friends.

673
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,680
Well, then that's their problem, because you're perfect.

674
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,200
Yeah, okay.

675
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,440
No.

676
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,850
Sweetie, listen to me.

677
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,480
You are perfect.

678
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:58,130
But you're gonna meet a lot of stupid people in your life,

679
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,190
And they're just not gonna get you.

680
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,010
Screw 'em.

681
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:09,790
All that matters is that you never, for a second, change who you are.

682
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,370
I know.

683
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,140
Promise?

684
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,190
Yeah.

685
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,620
Mom?

686
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,720
Yeah?

687
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,820
Did you get rid of the theater tickets yet?

688
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,280
No. Do you want to go?

689
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,900
I mean,

690
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,980
Just because Randy's an idiot doesn't

691
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,570
Mean we have to waste perfectly good tickets.

692
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,440
Yeah, man.

693
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,960
I would love to see "in the heights."

694
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,310
Are you kidding me? oh, my baby boy.

695
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,140
Sorry. sorry. I know you don't like that.

696
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,020
It's okay. you know, I love you, mom.

697
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,800
Oh... I love you, baby.

698
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,490
So how was the trip with Connor? was there nudity?

699
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,040
-Did you get a look... down under? -It was a complete bust.

700
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,610
For some reason, he's completed devoted to that...

701
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,210
Molly.

702
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,460
Ugh. devotion.

703
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,820
Does he see that she doesn't use eyeliner?

704
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,940
So what's the plan? what do we do now?

705
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,720
Nothing. there is no plan.

706
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,510
I'm not gonna beg.

707
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:38,820
If he wants to marry that do-gooding gremlin, that's his choice.

708
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,990
I'm sorry, willie.

709
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,560
Sorry for what?

710
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:52,170
Oh, and, uh, marc, I heard you got into the Y.E.T.I program.

711
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,980
I trust that's not going to interfere with your job here.

712
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,070
Oh, of course not.

713
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,010
Good.

714
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,060
I can't think of anyone more deserving.

715
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,850
Congratulations.

716
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,390
Betty, can you come in here a moment?

717
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,590
Betty...

718
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:32,880
I know how important Y.E.T.I. was to you,

719
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,680
and I dropped the ball.

720
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,280
It's fine. no, it's not.

721
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,500
And now I'm hearing you dropped out so marc could get in?

722
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,820
Y.E.T.I. won't take two people from the same magazine.

723
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,170
Yeah, that's why I made a couple calls.

724
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,440
I just thought, you know,

725
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,460
They should know you worked at "player" this year, too.

726
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,560
Just don't drop out this time.

727
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,180
Did you get me accepted?

728
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,230
All you had to do was say I worked at "player"?

729
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,010
Yeah. now you and marc are from different magazines.

730
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,680
I'm sure this didn't hurt either.

731
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,020
I'm sorry it took me so long to write your recommendation.

732
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,710
Daniel, this is six pages.

733
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,520
That's short. you should have seen the first draft.

734
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,380
Well...

735
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,370
I don't--i don't even know what to say.

736
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:30,480
Uh, sorry about before?

737
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:34,230
Look, I know you're going places, just--you gotta do me a favor.

738
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,070
Try not to get there too fast.

739
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,120
I'd be lying if I didn't say I wish you

740
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,230
Were my assistant for the next 20 years.

741
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,420
But don't worry.

742
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,470
I know in 20 years, I'll probably be your assistant.

743
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,530
Daniel told me we both got in.

744
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:19,660
Pretty cool, right? did you see the schedule of speakers?

745
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,540
Anna Wintour and Tina Brown in the same week. ah!

746
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,050
This is just the first step, you know?

747
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,430
We're gonna be huge.

748
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:32,180
-Betty, phone. -Marc, where is my moisturizer?

749
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,270
Coming, willie.

750
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,850
Daniel Meade's office.

751
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,800
Oh, thank you for calling back. I wanted to confirm...
