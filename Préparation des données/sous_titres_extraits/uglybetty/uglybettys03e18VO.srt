1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,400
??? i promise you will not be disappointed.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,400
- my dad makes the best breakfast in queens.
- great.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,600
well, not just
queens--all of new york.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,800
- you haven't had breakfast
at the four seasons.
- neither have you.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,500
i just know everything
they do is first-class.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,200
- tell 'em, matt. you're rich.
- justin...

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,500
- no, it's okay. i have had
brunch there a few times.
- matt, you are going to love...

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,100
- my guadalajara scramble <i>espectacular.</i>
- mmm.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,900
i dream
about eating these.

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,400
mm-hmm. and you'll
keep dreaming.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,200
only grapefruit and egg whites
for you this morning, mist.

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,000
hot!

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,600
 <i>mija,</i> where's the fire?

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,800
slow down.

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,600
- i have to meet daniel at the office.
- on a saturday?

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,500
he's working so hard to keep
this company from sinking,

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,200
and besides, matt and i are
going to a ranger game today.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,500
- wow.
- i don't get hockey.

19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,100
- all that ice, and no one's figure skating?
- betty, i didn't even know

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,000
- you liked hockey.
- no, she doesn't. actually,
i have to go for work and--

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,600
and i owe him. he stayed in
my office for, like, an hour

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,100
- when i worked late.
- yeah, i read every issue of "mode"

23
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,000
over the last three years--
a lot of boobs.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,700
i'm just saying.
oh, don't forget to meet me

25
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,400
at my mom's place.
um, i'm staying there

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
- while they fix my apartment.
- moms love betty. they don't love me.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,700
- actually, we haven't even met yet.
- well, she's away, but, uh, 
she's dying for meeting betty.

28
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,800
- uh, she says betty sounds like
the daughter she never had.
- aww.

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,600
- it's, uh, 2921 madison avenue.
- what apartment?

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,500
- uh, the whole building.
- how rich are you?

31
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,600
- how much money do you have?
- justin! hilda...

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,200
what?

33
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,500
- anybody home?
- oh, crap. i forgot i have
a haircut appointment.

34
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,500
- hi, archie!
- hi!

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
- that's the councilman?
- yeah.

36
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,300
please come in,
your excellency.

37
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,600
- ignacio, i keep telling you,
please just call me archie.
- no, sir,

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,800
stay and eat. then you can
have a haircut.

39
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,900
- he's cute, hilda.
- and he's single, and he likes her.

40
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,900
that's why he comes here
every week to get his "haircut."

41
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,300
- go out with him.
- yeah, i don't know.

42
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,800
- he's nice, but he's missing something.
- what, a wedding ring like your last boyfriend?

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,300
oh, no!

44
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,700
okay, i'm leaving.
have fun.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,900
behave.

46
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,900
okay.

47
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,500
hilda, he's a nice guy.
give him a chance.

48
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,100
- don't.
- don't.

49
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,900
you're crazy.

50
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,500
derek jeter
is a good-looking guy.

51
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
sorry, but he doesn't
do it for me.

52
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,900
- are you kidding me?
that guy gets so much--
- don't be gross.

53
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,700
fun. the guy
gets so much fun,

54
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,300
- you wouldn't believe it.
- i like fun.

55
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,100
i hate that you have to go
to work on a saturday.

56
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,200
i know, but until "mode"
gets back on its feet,

57
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,400
- it's gotta be seven days a week.
- you know, when you're gone,

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,700
- i think i'll take a little
hike in prospect park.
- whoa, whoa, whoa. no no no no.

59
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,100
hey, look, why don't you
just hang out?

60
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,000
i'll bring you some soup,
watch tv, you can stay warm.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,100
i have cancer, daniel.

62
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,900
it's not like a bowl of soup
and a nap, and i'll be over it.

63
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,800
look,
will you do it for me?

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,100
please.

65
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,400
okay.

66
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,600
your meeting
with miles foster's at 4:00.

67
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,700
wilhelmina's on the way.

68
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,300
i put out a spread
in the conference room--

69
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,200
cheese, olives, salami--

70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,800
- not the kind that makes you gassy.
- betty, that was once. it was a flue.

71
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,500
yeah...
i wouldn't risk it.

72
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,200
also, great news--
the doctor you want for molly

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,400
is in town for the rest
of the week.

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,600
- here's his number.
- dr. simon? that's fantastic.

75
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,400
betty, thank you so much
for everything today.

76
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,900
- i know you're not getting paid.
- oh, stop, daniel.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,800
if you need my help,
i'm always here.

78
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,600
and you get to go meet
your boyfriend right now.

79
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,500
matt is not my boyfriend.

80
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,300
if i've learned one thing
from molly's illness,

81
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,200
it's that if you have
something good,

82
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,300
you have to enjoy it.

83
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,500
i am enjoying it.

84
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,400
i just don't want
to put a label on it.

85
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,600
you know, what's the point?
boyfriend, girlfriend--

86
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,500
- what does that mean?
- um, i think it means
you're getting serious.

87
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,800
daniel, all i'm thinking
about right now

88
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,700
is going
to a hockey game.

89
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,900
go, rangers! whoo-hoo!

90
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,000
so i learned miles has
wall-to-wall meetings

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,800
- with every editor in town.
- well, no surprise.

92
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,800
whenever he shoots a cover,
issues fly off the newsstands.

93
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
i know.
we get him first, though.

94
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,900
we have a good chance.

95
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,500
i'm afraid
we can't afford him.

96
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,300
i know. he costs more
than our entire photo budget.

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,800
well,
let's make it tasty.

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,700
- promise him complete creative control.
- yeah, great.

99
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,600
make him want us
more than we want him?

100
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,800
- just make sure you play it cool in there.
- i always play it cool.

101
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,200
well, right now you've got
that upper-lip sweat you get

102
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,500
- when you're desperate.
- it's water. i just washed my face.

103
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,200
if that's what you say.

104
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,700
we've got
a lot riding on this,

105
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,300
so let's make it happen.

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,200
??? to have you here in mode.

107
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,100
we're such fans
of your work.

108
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,400
that "brady bunch"-inspired
shoot you did

109
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,500
with brad and angelina
and the six kids--genius.

110
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,500
how on earth did you get
jennifer aniston to play alice?

111
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,200
i don't know
what's hip or cool.

112
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,700
i just... take pictures.

113
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,700
i'm trying to do something that
makes me feel happy inside.

114
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,600
well, wilhelmina and i
would certainly love

115
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,400
- to make you feel happy inside.
- daniel.

116
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,000
sorry. did that sound weird?
you know what i mean.

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,200
yeah, yeah, no worries.

118
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,300
this all sounds good.
let's do it.

119
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,000
and you will have
complete creative control

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,700
- with no editorial interference.
- fantastic.

121
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,200
and we appreciate you
taking a cut in your fee.

122
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,500
and it's off.

123
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,600
you, uh, you do understand that
we're in a bit of a crunch.

124
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,800
so i have to suffer?
mnh-mnh, sorry.

125
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,600
i am a freakin' genius, man.
you said it yourself.

126
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,200
i can go down the block
to "vanity fair,"

127
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,500
and they'll pay my fee.
so listen.

128
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,900
you have until friday.
if you have the money,

129
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,300
i'll sign the contract,
and if not... sayonara.

130
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,300
we need him.

131
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,200
yes, we do.

132
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,600
so this is gonna have to come
out of our own pocket.

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,900
wilhelmina, if you want,
i can cover this.

134
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,000
no, that won't be
necessary.

135
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,700
i'll cover my half.

136
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,800
come on. i have
more resources than you.

137
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,700
- how about i pay?
- how about you worry
about your end,

138
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,500
and i'll worry
about mine, okay?

139
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,000
i got this. no problem.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,500
hello?

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,100
matt! hello?

142
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
matt! hello.

143
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,900
oh, good.

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,900
i'm back early. left my bags
by the service entrance.

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
if you could go
and, uh, bring them in.

146
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,100

ugly betty 318</font>

170
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
- dying to meet me." matt, she
didn't even know who i was.
- i--

171
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,400
- she thought i was your maid!
- i know. i screwed up. i'm sorry.

172
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,900
why did you tell me
that i was

173
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,500
- "the daughter she wished she had"?
- yeah, i don't know why i added that details.

174
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,900
- it's weird, uh, especially
since i have a sister.
- what?

175
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,300
- no, no, i don't have a sister.
it's a bad joke!
- so what, were you, like, hiding me from her?

176
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,600
no, i was hiding her
from you. i--

177
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,000
look, my mom
is tricky, betty.

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,900
she's judgmental
and controlling,

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,200
and no one i date
is ever good enough for her.

180
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,500
well, then why didn't you
just tell me that?

181
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,200
moms love me, matt.
she'll love me.

182
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,900
- she just has to get to know me.
- you know, i just didn't want to put you

183
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,000
through the victoria hartley
taste test.

184
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
but you have to
put me through

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,300
the victoria hartley
taste test.

186
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,200
she's your mother. and if my
family didn't like the taste

187
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,800
of someone i was dating,
well, then that would matter.

188
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,000
- can we drop the whole taste thing?
- yeah, let's.

189
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,200
look, i'm just saying,
it matters if your mom likes me.

190
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,700
it matters for us, you know?
when can i meet her again?

191
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,500
seriously?

192
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,400
yeah. i can handle anything.
dinner, lunch, coffee--

193
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,300
i'm really good at coffee.

194
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,300
how about a party?

195
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,100
she's having this... thing
on friday night.

196
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,500
- hmm. i didn't get an invitation.
- okay! okay, okay.

197
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,200
would you like to go
to a party with me

198
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
- at my mother's apartment friday night?
- ooh, friday?

199
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,500
i think i have an online
scrabble tournament.

200
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,100
i'm just kidding. yes!
let's do it.

201
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,600
you're the best,
you know that?

202
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,900
okay, let's go. i don't want
to be late for the game.

203
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,500
- keep the change, buddy.
- thanks.

204
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,700
willie...
selling your possessions?

205
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,300
isn't that, like,

206
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,200
one rung above appearing
on a reality show?

207
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,400
i have to, marc.
it's not just that photographer.

208
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,300
running meade costs a fortune.

209
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,400
- i can't let daniel leverage me
out of the company.
- but you're rich.

210
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,200
- in certain things--
real estate, clothing, attitude.
- mm.

211
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,500
but daniel has cash,
and i don't.

212
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,400
- your taste is extraordinary, ms. slater.
- i know.

213
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,800
that sable is spectacular.
is the lining hand stitched?

214
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,100
oh, yes, by a seamstress
from paris

215
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,800
whose great-great-grandfather
was furrier to napoleon.

216
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,300
wow. really?

217
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,200
- how the hell should i know?
- oh.

218
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,500
hey, why can't you just ask one
of your rich friends for money,

219
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,200
like the donald or sumner
or martha?

220
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
and have one
of those bitches own me?

221
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,600
no way.
my money, my equity.

222
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,300
wow, you're, like, the world's
sexiest economics teacher.

223
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,300
marc, if i panic now,
i will lose everything.

224
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,000
so with a few
short-term cutbacks

225
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
here and at the office,
i'll be fine.

226
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,400
- ms. slater, may i--
- let's cut the bryn mawr niceties, okay?

227
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,900
- do you want my things or not?
- we do.

228
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,500
don't worry ms. slater, we're very discreet.

229
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,400
good.

230
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,700
come back on friday with
the check for the down payment.

231
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,500
oh... for god sake.

232
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,100
marc, stop crying.

233
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,200
if you'd like,
you may try on the sable...

234
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,800
one last time.

235
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,700
hey, betty, a little bird
told me about your fancy dinner

236
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,100
- with your rich boyfriend.
- oh, was the little bird
looking at the calendar

237
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,500
- on my desk?
- well, what am i supposed to do?

238
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,300
you never open up to me
anymore.

239
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,100
- when we were roomies,
we shared everything.
- no. amanda, you shared everything.

240
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,600
and some of it
was weird.

241
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,300
you know, b., you are playing
this matt thing perfectly.

242
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,800
a few more moves,
and you will be

243
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,900
- in the gold digger hall of fame.
- i am not a gold digger.

244
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,700
i could care less
about matt's money.

245
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,300
and...
cut, print, oscar.

246
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,000
don't change a word.
you nailed it.

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,900
amanda, i really like matt,
and he likes me.

248
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,100
- and now i just need
his mom to like me.
- hmm.

249
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,400
the show was tragic.

250
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,600
but if i know henri,
he'll be back on top in no time.

251
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,300
excuse me.

252
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,000
marc! it's 4:00.

253
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,700
i'm sorry, it's time

254
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,100
for my afternoon caviar
and champagne.

255
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,100
i'll have to call you back.

256
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,000
good grief.

257
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,800
what the hell is this?

258
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,300
marc!

259
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,600
what is this?

260
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,200
it's an almond,
and that's seltzer.

261
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,700
where is the beluga?
where's the krug?

262
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,200
we can't afford it
with our new office budget.

263
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,700
i was worried that you
might react this way,

264
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,700
- but remember, you said that
you wanted to make sacrifices.
- you're right, you're right.

265
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,000
this is exactly
what i was talking about.

266
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,300
it's what we need.

267
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,600
so, um...
almonds, you said?

268
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,800
yes.

269
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,800
almonds...

270
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,500
mmm. is there anything else
that i can...

271
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,200
do for you?

272
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,200
i'm fine. i have
everything i need.

273
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,200
so... 

274
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,400
eight years ago,
molly was diagnosed.

275
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,200
- they didn't catch it early.
- yes, i can see the cancer
was rather advanced.

276
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,700
- that's why the treatment
was so aggressive.
- but it worked.

277
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,100
i mean, look at her.
she's healthy.

278
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,200
listen, all that matters
is her ability

279
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,900
to respond to my treatment,
and based on what i'm seeing,

280
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,100
there's only a small chance,
but it is a chance.

281
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,300
i'm about to begin work
on a new clinical study.

282
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,500
i will send the information
to your office.

283
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,900
you'll let me know
what you want to do.

284
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,500
- could we have a couple of days
to think about it?
- molly, no.

285
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,400
dr. simon, we don't need
to take a few days.

286
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,500
we have our answer.
we're in.

287
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
mrs. meade!

288
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,800
i was wondering if you could
help me with something.

289
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,200
oh, you're worried about
victoria hartley's party.

290
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,100
- daniel told you?
- he tells me everything.

291
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,500
oh, by the way,
hilda should totally go out

292
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,800
with that councilman.

293
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,600
so, uh, you--
you know mrs. hartley?

294
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,800
oh, yes.

295
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,100
see, i've never been
to anything this fancy.

296
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,400
- what do i need to know?
- oh, betty, please, you know which fork to use.

297
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,600
- outside in.
- mm-hmm. and the bread plate is on...

298
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,800
- my left.
- and the big glass is for...

299
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,200
- red wine!
- so you're fine. what's the topic?

300
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,700
- uh, topic?
- all these east side cows always
have a topic of conversation

301
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
they like to introduce
during the meal.

302
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,500
- last week, mine was the romanov dynasty.
- oh, no, i don't know what the topic is.

303
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,600
- what if it's something
that i know nothing about?
- well, do you have the phone number?

304
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,600
- yes.
- dial it.

305
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,100
- uh...
- we'll get one of the maids to tell us.

306
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,000
oh, that's a great idea.
okay.

307
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,100
hello, yes, may i please
speak to consuela?

308
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,700
there's always
a consuela.

309
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,600
hola, consuela.

310
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,900
 <i>Como esta?</i>

311
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,700

312
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,100
oh, um...

313
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,400
hola, senora.

314
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,900
hola. um...

315
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,600

00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:37,000
 <i>Y queria saber si sabias,</i>
 <i>uh, el tPico de discusiN...</i>

317
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,900

318
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,800

 <i>gracias!</i> ha! torture!

320
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,000
the topic is torture!
isn't that great?

321
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,100
that's a little obvious.

322
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,100
arianna did torture
at her luncheon last year.

323
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,300
we waterboarded liz smith.

324
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,200
i just read this article
in "the new republic"

325
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,000
about the ethics of torture.

326
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,000
oh, i'm so happy.
thank you.

327
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,900
i'm so glad.

328
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,600
hey, willie, i just got
a bulletin from engineering.
major fashion news

329
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,300
all the tvs need to be turned
off. they're doing some sort

330
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,600
of test or something.
no computers, either.

331
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,300
- there's a virus going around or something.
- marc, what is going on?

332
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,000
nothing, it's just tech stuff.
it's completely normal.

333
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,200
- don't read any papers tomorrow--bad ink.
- don't make me hit you.

334
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,800
 <i>okay!</i> i got a call from
my source at "fashion buzz,"

335
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,000
and there's a story
going around

336
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,200
that might have something
to do with you.

337
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,900
<i> but i've saved</i>
 <i>the best piece of gossip</i>

338
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,400
 <i>masquerading as news</i>
 <i>for last.</i>

339
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,800
 <i>which fabulous</i>
 <i>fashion world editor,</i>

340
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,500
"mode"-ivated <i>by a recent</i>
 <i>reversal of fortune,</i>

341
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
 <i>has begun to sell off</i>
 <i>her clothes</i> willy-nilly?

342
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,400
 <i>oh, and this tidbit</i>
 <i>positively</i> slay-ter-ed <i>me.</i>

343
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,700
 <i>her daily snack</i>
 <i>is now a healthy combination</i>

344
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,700
 <i>of food-stamp-friendly nuts</i>
 <i>and soda water.</i>

345
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,000
 <i>it's all so delicious...</i>
 <i>and humiliating.</i>

346
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,900
 <i>i'd tell you more,</i>
 <i>but i'm on my way out</i>

347
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,600
 <i>to a local thrift store</i>
 <i>to purchase</i>

348
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,100
 <i>one of wilhelmina slater's</i>
 <i>former possessions.</i>

349
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,000
 <i>oops.</i>
 <i>did i say her name?</i>
wilhelmina slater

350
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,200
 <i>i'm sorry.</i>

351
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,600
 <i>because you know i'd never</i>
 <i>mock someone when they're down.</i>

352
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,800
i have <i>no</i> idea
how it got out.

353
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,700
i swear i didn't
tell anyone.

354
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,100
it's fine, marc.

355
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,600
obviously,
there's a mole here somewhere.

356
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,100
and i promise you,
i will find it,

357
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,700
and i will have it removed.

358
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,700
cancel my calls and meetings.
i'm done for the day.

359
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,700
- can i get you anything?
- no, i'm fine.

360
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,600
- willie--
- i said i'm fine.

361
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,800
there are some
who would argue

362
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,700
that under
certain circumstances,

363
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,000
torture is permissible.

364
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,200
but others would say--

365
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,800
ow! justin,
that is tight!

366
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,100
don't you want
to look good for matt's mom?

367
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
- yes.
- well, this is one of those instances

368
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,400
where torture is necessary.

369
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,000
good luck.

370
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,500
elena, that's
one too many plates.

371
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,300
- remember? betty's leaving.
- oh, that's all right. just leave it.

372
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,800
- no, i'll take it into the kitchen.
- no, no, don't bother.

373
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,000
it's no bother.

374
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,600
what is going on?

375
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,200
hilda, remember how you
asked me to let you know

376
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,600
when you do that thing
with your eyebrows

377
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,400
that makes you look
like the son of sam?

378
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,000
hey, everyone.

379
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,700
thanks so much
for having me over.

380
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,200
hey, archie,
great to see you.

381
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,900
councilman?

382
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,600
 - <i>bienvenido, seOr.</i>
- hey, hey.

383
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,900
welcome. here--here,
take the wine.

384
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,500
- thank you.
- it's so good to see you. come on in.

385
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,200
- bye, hilda.
- unh-unh. i am gonna get you for this.

386
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,200
oh, come on, hilda.
try and have a good time.

387
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,400
 archie is great.
you deserve a good guy.

388
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,100
willie.

389
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,600
willie, the auction house people
are here to do the pickup.

390
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,800
one second.

391
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,700
willie?

392
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,000
wilhelmina, are you here?

393
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,600
hello, marc.

394
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,300
you know what?

395
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,600
- i am not happy about this.
- come on.

396
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,100
just give him
a chance.

397
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,400
i hope
you' hungry.

398
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,700
because ignacio's
been cooking up a storm.

399
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,300
well, i can't tell you how good
it is to get a home-cooked meal.

400
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,000
- really, thank you so much
for having me over.
- please, you must be always having dinner 

401
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,600
- oh... 
- with mayors and governors and princes
and bishops--

402
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,100
no, it's more like
chinese takeout

403
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,400
- alone in my apartment, really.
- he's so modest.

404
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,600
the man's a celebrity,
and he's so modest.

405
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,900
<i>papi,</i>
he's a queens councilman.

406
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,700
he's not justin timberlake.

407
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,100
thank you, hilda,

408
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,900
for keeping my feet
on the ground.

409
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,700
you see that? hilda could
be good for you.

410
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,600
hey.

411
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
excuse us
for a second.

412
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,500
stop scowling.

413
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,400
i don't like surprises,
elena.

414
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,000
mom...
here's your medication.

415
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,100
thank you.

416
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,200
- thank you.
- enjoy.

417
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,400
wow. everything's
so fancy.

418
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,100
and everyone looks so...
perfect.

419
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,600
yeah, only 'cause they've
had an army of people

420
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,000
working on them all afternoon.

421
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,800
and you look beautiful.

422
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,200
thank you.
you look so...

423
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,900
- hello, honey.
- ah.

424
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,000
don't you look handsome?
i love that tie on you.

425
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,300
- where'd you get it?
- you bought it for me.

426
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,900
oh. well, aren't i clever?

427
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,500
- um, you've met betty.
- oh, yes, of course.

428
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,800
i'm, uh, i'm so happy
that you could make it.

429
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,800
and i won't ask you

430
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,200
to bring up any of
my bags tonight. 

431
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,900
matthew, don't just
stand off to the side.

432
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,500
make sure you circulate.

433
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,400
edith, i love
your new labradoodle.

434
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,800
- well, that didn't go so bad.
- right, and remember,

435
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,500
- you still have "torture"
to look forward to.
- mm-hmm.

436
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,100
- stuffed mushroom?
- ooh.

437
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,600
i'll be right back.
excuse me. hello there.

438
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,800
- oh, uh, hi, judge wincroft.
- we're right over there.

439
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,900
- mmm.
- he has an s&m dungeon

440
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,200
- in the basement of his weekend house.
- hmm. this is great.

441
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,000
uh, betty.

442
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,100
i'd like you to meet
judge wincroft.

443
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,900
it's very nice
to meet you.

444
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,200
matt, i don't know where
my mushroom cap went.

445
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,300
excuse me.
dinner is served.

446
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,900
but first, i would like
to introduce everyone

447
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,100
to the newest piece
in the hartley art collection.

448
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,300
beginning in december,

449
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,500
it will be on display
at the louvre.

450
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,800
but right now it is here
in my living room.

451
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,900
oh, my god,
is that a mushroom cap?

452
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,900
oh, it's ruined.

453
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,800
what is an appetizer

454
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,500
doing on my painting?

455
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,500
actually, miss--

456
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,200
it was me, mom.
that's my mushroom cap.

457
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,200
i was fooling around, tossing
stuff at, uh, mr. randolph.

458
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,800
i-i apologize.

459
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,300
oh, no, that's fine.

460
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,200
if the artist were alive,
he'd get a good laugh,

461
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,500
but he's dead,
which is why it's so valuable.

462
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,500
into the dining room,
everyone.

463
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,600
so unlike matthew
to do something like that.

464
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,200
i guess you bring out his...
playful side. hmm?

465
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,400
i'm so sorry.

466
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,800
it's okay.
don't worry.

467
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,100
marc, i thought
i would be fine,

468
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,400
selling everything...

469
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,500
but i'm not.

470
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,200
so then don't.

471
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,400
but i need the money.

472
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
why, god? why?

473
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,800
what have i done
to anger you?

474
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,500
i just hate seeing you
like this.

475
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,500
are you taking a picture of me
on your cell phone?

476
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,600
no. <i>no.</i> oh!

477
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,300
this is killing me
as much as it's killing you.

478
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,500
do you think i like living
without your luxuries?

479
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,100
that's just it, marc.
they're not just luxuries.

480
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,100
these things are who i am.

481
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,000
each fur tells a story.

482
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,600
each piece of jewelry
is a piece of me.

483
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,200
it reminds me that
i've achieved something,

484
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,900
because, damn it, i have.

485
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,900
i came from nothing,
and i've accomplished something.

486
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,400
- but your father was a senator.
- oh, shut up.

487
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,500
it's the woman
from the auction house.

488
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,800
what do you want me
to tell her?

489
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,500
take it. take all of this.

490
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,900
do with it what you want.
i don't care anymore!

491
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,600
just bring me the money!

492
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,100
- marc, do you like what you see?
- uh-huh.

493
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,400
well, get used to it,
because starting now,

494
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,200
mama is downsizing.

495
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,300
not where it counts, baby!

496
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,600
all right. so i am gonna
run by the office,

497
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,100
close the deal
with this photographer.

498
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,200
then i'm gonna be back

499
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,400
with a couple of steaks,
bottle of wine.

500
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,000
- you and i are gonna celebrate.
- have you read about the treatment, daniel?

501
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,300
- some of these side effects are rough.
- i know, but, i mean, molly, it could work.

502
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,600
10% chance, and considering
my history, more like 2%.

503
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,200
yeah, but it's still 2%.

504
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,000
i mean, come on,
think about our future.

505
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,500
there is no future, daniel.

506
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,800
this, what we have right now,
is our future.

507
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,100
- don't say that.
- i'm dying, daniel.

508
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,100
no!

509
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,900
i realize that it's so hard
for me to understand

510
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,700
what it is
you're going through.

511
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,500
molly,
i'm not going anywhere.

512
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,500
i'm gonna be right by your side
through all of this.

513
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,800
i promise. please.

514
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,000
i'm sorry, honey.

515
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,700
i know how i want to live
the rest of my life,

516
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,400
- and it's not like this.
- molly, don't--

517
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,500
i can't do it.

518
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,900
so anyway, this council meeting
went on forever,

519
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,900
and it was just so hot in there,
i actually fell asleep.

520
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,600
i mean, i even snored.

521
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,800
- you didn't.
- well, it could have been embarrassing,

522
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,300
but i managed to turn
my snore into a "nay."

523
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,400
that's hilarious.
isn't that hilarious, hilda?

524
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
really.

525
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,500
oh, yeah, that is funny.

526
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,000
well, i know i'm gonna hate
myself in the morning,

527
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,700
but i'm gonna treat myself
to one more new potato.

528
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,000
this was an incredible meal,
ignacio.

529
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,700
it was my pleasure,
your honor.

530
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
i just hope we can make
a habit of this.

531
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,800
- right, hilda?
- oh, yes. absolutely.

532
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,300
you should just come
whenever you want.

533
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
everybody,
please be seated.

534
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,200
- are you sure there's nothing i--
- don't worry about it.

535
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,100
matthew, i thought it would be
fun if we split couples up.

536
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,100
- come. i want you back there with me.
- um, mom, i want to sit with betty.

537
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,700
no, stop. the name cards
were placed hours ago.

538
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,400
- it's all been settled.
- it's okay.

539
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,100
ignacio, come help me
with dessert.

540
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,400
oh, yeah. excuse us.

541
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,300
oh, justin.

542
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,400
- i'm trying to enjoy my new potato.
- mm-hmm.

543
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,800
hey. excuse me.

544
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,000
so how awkward
is this for you?

545
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,400
what? no!
why would this be awkward?

546
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,500
because they're working their
butts off trying to fix us up.

547
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,400
archie, i'm sorry.
honestly, i didn't know.

548
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,000
they just sprung this on me.

549
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,900
please.
it happens all the time.

550
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,900
i'm a reasonably
attractive man in his 40s

551
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,600
with a midlevel government job.

552
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,900
i'm a... catch.

553
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,800
and you, your eyes

554
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,100
have a story
that they wish to tell,

555
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,800
and i have my whole life,

556
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,900
and i listen well.

557
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,500
that's a justin timberlake song.

558
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,000
oh, i'm so glad
you got that,

559
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,700
'cause that would have
been really weird.

560
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,400
oh! thank you.

561
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,500
i'm so pleased you could
all be here tonight.

562
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,400
there's just so much
to talk about,

563
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,900
so many interesting
things happening.

564
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,100
but, um, you know me.
i like to stick to one topic,

565
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,200
and it's something that
has been, uh, much on my mind,

566
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,700
because it speaks to how
civilized people should live.
betty says: torture!

567
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,100
what is going to be...

568
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,000
the future of opera?

569
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,300
opera?

570
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,100
you have a thought, betty?

571
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,000
i was just so excited
to hear the topic.

572
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,800
i'm sorry. please go on.

573
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,100
oh, no. really,
why don't you start us off?

574
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,000
everybody, this is,
uh, betty suarez.

575
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,700
she is a friend of matthew's.

576
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,500
please, betty. i'd be fascinated
to hear your opinion.

577
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,300
the future of opera.

578
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,900
go.

579
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,100
my experience with opera...

580
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,200
is not so vast.

581
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,200
so i guess my opinion...

582
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,500
is not so...

583
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,500
you know, fully...

584
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,700
you know, formed...

585
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,500
as... as some of you...

586
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,100
matt says:mode photo spread "opera" last november
gareth pugh

587
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,000
carmen

588
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,900
aida

589
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,800
the ring

590
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,700
rigoletto

591
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,300
opera is fashion.

592
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,600
meaning?

593
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,300
meaning that the opera
will thrive

594
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,200
as any art thrives--

595
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,500
uh, by evolving
and embracing new ideas

596
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,200
and, of course, by giving
its audience a grander,

597
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,600
more hopeful
version of themselves.

598
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,900
that is as succinct
and insightful

599
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,700
a piece of criticism
as i have ever heard.

600
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,400
do you mind if i use it
in my next column?

601
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,200
but what do you mean
when you say "fashion"?

602
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,600
well, i work at "mode."

603
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,800
i love "mode."
it's like my bible.

604
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,800
you know,
and in some respects,

605
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,900
what is more archaic
than couture dresses?

606
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,700
- like opera.
- exactly, and eventually,
these couture collections

607
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,600
have an enormous influence
on our modern style.

608
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,000
and opera can do
the same thing.

609
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,400
absolutely right.

610
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,500
i saw "don giovanni"
on the lawn last year...

611
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
here you go, councilman.

612
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,500
- ah. thank you for the takeout, ignacio.
- it was my honor.

613
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:00,000
- who knows? my cooking
may be eaten by royalty.
- well, i was thinking of leaving a little

614
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,700
for my cleaning lady tomorrow.

615
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,200
just as good.

616
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,000
uh, honey, could you come help
me in the kitchen with, uh...

617
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,300
- you know.
- oh, yeah. the "you know."

618
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,700
- that--that thing.
uh, good night.
- mm-hmm.

619
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,700
- excuse us.
- thanks again.

620
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,300
yeah. subtlety doesn't run
in this family's genes, so...

621
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,700
i guess according
to their plan,

622
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,500
this is when i'm supposed
to ask you out.

623
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,700
yeah.
yeah, that's the plan.

624
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,900
- well, good night.
- whoa, wait a minute.

625
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,400
you're gonna
disappoint them like that?

626
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,700
- my dad cooked you dinner.
- hilda, you're great.

627
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,200
and nothing
would make me happier

628
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,300
than to take you out
on a real date--

629
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,300
- one that you know about.
- that sounds good.

630
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,200
okay, guys. i asked her out,
and she said yes.

631
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,700
- what? oh, my god!
- what? what a surprise!

632
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,300
- we had no idea!
- oh, we're shocked.

633
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,800
 <i>ay,</i> please.

634
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,700
miles, what can i say? we just
couldn't live without you.

635
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
well, listen,
i am so sorry about the way

636
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,000
our last meeting ended.
i just hate getting caught up

637
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,600
- in all these messy business details.
- and yet you do.

638
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,800
- i know. i'm so cute.
- so i guess we'll check in next week,

639
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,700
- start kicking around a concept?
- whatever. i am easy.

640
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,900
love to you both.
air kiss.

641
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,800
air kiss. au revoir.

642
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,700
so i see you put
your money together.

643
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,400
daniel, if we're
gonna be partners,

644
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,200
we need to be partners
all the way.

645
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,600
so i did what i had to do.

646
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,300
you know... 
i know you think

647
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,400
i'm always looking for a way
to muscle u out,

648
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,200
but really, i'm not.

649
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,900
life is too short.

650
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,100
well, how about that.

651
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,300
daniel meade is
waxing philosophical.

652
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,800
just beginning to realize
what's most important...

653
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,900
because of molly.

654
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,100
she's just determined to
live life on her own terms,

655
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,000
even if it kills her.

656
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,700
oh, mrs. hartley.

657
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,800
hi. i was just looking
at your pictures.

658
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,200
- they're great.
- oh. mm. so, betty,
where did you go to college?

659
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,300
- um, queens college.
- oh, lovely.

660
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,700
and were you the first person
in your family to go?

661
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,600
yep.
yeah, i-i lived at home,

662
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,700
and i worked the whole time,
but i did it.

663
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,200
good for you.
that's wonderful.

664
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,400
you're ambitious.
i can see you're going places.

665
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,100
oh, wow. thank you.

666
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,900
yes. uh, matthew went to yale.
he speaks three languages.

667
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,400
uh, he spent a year in rome
on a fulbright.

668
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,500
- have you heard him play the piano?
- nope, not yet,

669
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,400
but i can wait to.

670
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,200
oh, well,
he plays beautifully.

671
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,100
he took lessons for years
at the turtle bay music school.

672
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,400
- do you know it?
- no. i haven't heard of it.

673
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,900
oh, it's a wonderful place.
all the kids study there.

674
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,300
so, uh, tell me, what exactly

675
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,500
do the two of you
have in common?

676
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:19,200
uh, w-well, loads.

677
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,600
uh-huh. loads.

678
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,800
betty, i have high hopes
for my son.

679
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,900
he's been given
every privilege,

680
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,700
and i expect him
to take advantage of that.

681
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,400
okay. uh, i'm not sure i
understand what you're saying.

682
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,600
what i'm saying is that,

683
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,300
uh, i hope you enjoyed
your meal tonight,

684
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,900
but i don't think that
we'll be seeing you again.

685
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,100
you know, if you're, uh, cold,
you could just say something.

686
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,300
we have, like,
17 fireplaces.

687
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,500
your mother just told me that
i'm not good enough for you

688
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,400
and we don't have a future.
i'm leaving.

689
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,500
- no, betty, please, please don't go. please.
- matt-- what if she's right?

690
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,600
- matt, what if it matters
that i didn't go to yale?
- it <i>doesn't</i> matter.

691
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,200
- this is too much for me.
- hey, hey, hey.

692
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,500
- i am not gonna come between
you and your mother.
- no, you won't. i'd like have you both in my life.

693
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,500
- what, and just keep us
apart all the time?
- now, betty, please listen.

694
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,400
look, i want this relationship
to have a future.

695
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,900
you have to trust me,
all right?

696
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,300
don't worry about her.

697
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,300
oh, matthew,
dessert is ready.

698
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,500
- come in after you say
good-bye to your friend.
- i'm not saying good-bye to her, mom.

699
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,000
- oh?
- i'm saying good-bye to you.

700
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,800
betty and i are leaving.

701
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,900
- oh, don't be ridiculous. just come--
- no, i don't know exactly what you said to her,

702
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,200
- but i can guess.
- matthew--

703
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,900
good night, mother.
i'm leaving with my girlfriend.

704
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,400
are you okay?

705
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,400
of course.
why wouldn't i be?

706
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,700
no reason. nothing.

707
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,200
i just don't want
our budget snacks

708
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,600
to set off another one
of your... episodes.

709
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,400
i swear, marc,
if you took a picture of me

710
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,200
on your cell phone,
i will kill you and eat you.

711
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,100
but i've arrived
at a better place,

712
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,900
- and daniel helped me get there.
- the boy blunder? how?

713
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,900
molly wants to live her life
till the day she dies.

714
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,500
and damn it, so do i!

715
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,200
but what about the cash?
what about the equity?

716
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,000
i can live without
the furs and the jewelry.

717
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,100
but to hell if i'm gonna
sacrifice everything.

718
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,400
i've worked too hard
to let it all slip away.

719
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,400
 so... how are you
going to pay for it?

720
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,000
i will do
whatever i have to do.

721
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,000
maybe i'll take out
a second mortgage.

722
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,200
all i know for sure is,
as god is my witness,

723
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:34,000
i will never go without
champagne and caviar again.

724
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,500
now pass me a bellini, please.

725
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,500
and i know it's horrible,

726
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,800
- but i'm just so frustrated about it.
- because she won't do the treatment?

727
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,100
i get what she'saying.
i do. it's just...

728
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,900
i've done everything right,

729
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,300
and for the first time
in my adult life,

730
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,300
i am really in love,

731
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,200
and i don't want to lose it.

732
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,600
- and--and this treatment, it could work.
- but, daniel--

733
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,900
no, i know, i know
i'm not the one with cancer.

734
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,600
of course
it's her decision, but--

735
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,800
look, she's just trying to
give you

736
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,300
- the time she does have left.
- but i want more.

737
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
sometimes you can't get more.

738
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,400
sometimes you have to take
what you get.

739
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,500
oh, hold the door!

740
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,600
- hi, mrs. meade.
- hello, betty.

741
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,800
so did you wow victoria hartley
with your take on torture?

742
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,200
no, not quite.
she changed the topic.

743
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,000
oh, that old trick.

744
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,600
and then she told me that i was
completely wrong for her son.

745
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,100
ooh. she's really playing by
the rich bitch handbook.

746
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,000
i keep thinking there's
gotta be something i can do

747
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,400
- to make her like me.
- oh, please, betty.

748
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,300
- you're never going to win
that woman over.
- well, maybe that's true,

749
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,300
but i just
don't understand why.

750
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,700
well, grow up, because not
everybody's going to like you.

751
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
you've just got to
suck it up and embrace it.

752
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,900
- there's nothing i can do?
- hell, yes, there's something you can do.

753
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,000
you can throw it
right back at her.

754
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,100
when one of those
silk stocking hags

755
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,200
stares me down,
do you know what i do?

756
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,200
stare back?

757
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,100
you got that right.

758
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,900
hey.

759
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,700
hey, it's cold out.

760
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,900
what's going on?

761
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,500
you want to live life?
we're gonna live life.

762
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,900
put on your jacket.
we're going hiking.

763
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,900
- and tomorrow,
we're gonna go to the beach.
- but it's freezing.

764
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,100
i don't care.

765
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,600
look, all i know
is every free moment

766
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,500
of every free day i have
is gonna be spent with you.

767
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,700
you want to go traveling?

768
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,100
you want to stay home?
you want to go to the movies?

769
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,400
you want to ride around
on the friggin' subway all day?

770
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,100
it doesn't matter. all that
matters is, i love you, molly,

771
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,000
and i'm gonna treasure every
moment i have left with you.

772
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
you got a problem with that?

773
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,700
no problem.

774
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,900
good.

775
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,900
let's go play in the snow.

776
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,800
okay. 

777
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,500
hey, where are you?
i'm here.

778
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,300
well, hurry up.
it's a beautiful day.

779
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,500
okay.

780
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,000
hi, mrs. hartley.

781
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,200
- waiting for my son?
- he's on his way down.

782
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,000
oh, that's right.

783
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,300
matthew's moving back in
to his apartment today.

784
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,300
i won't apologize for who i am
or what i think, betty.

785
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,400
well, neither will i.

786
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,300
what can i say?
my judgments are severe.

787
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
it's just the way
i look at the world.

788
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,500
well, i'm sorry for you.

789
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,700
but i might
be around for a while.

790
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,000
hey!

791
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,900
hey.

792
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,900
- ready to go?
- all set. want to get a cab?

793
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,200
no, let's walk.
it's a nice day.

794
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,100
so you play the piano?

795
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,100
oh, no.
