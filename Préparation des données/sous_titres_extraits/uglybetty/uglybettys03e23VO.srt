00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,430
suzuki st.Pierre here on day seven of "molly watch,"

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,170
where daniel meade's bride is about to leave the hospital.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,220
For those of you living on mars or in one of those weird religions that shuns tv,

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,170
molly's illness took a dramatic turn when she collapsed on her wedding night.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,400
the only bright spot has been daniel's transformation.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,830
The onetime man-whore is now a devoted husband,

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,630
and new york can't get enough of their new "it" couple...

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,360
prince charming and soon-to-be-sleeping beauty.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,060
here they come now.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,250
daniel,we love you!

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,880
So many well-wishers,even that adorable clown,

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,790
obviously on break from entertaining all those sick kids.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,440

Season 03 Episode 23</font>

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,560
I have been to his house.Why does he always do that?

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,870
Okay,before I forget,"the view" called.They want you on the show tomorrow.

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,100
All this attention's insane.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,140
I think it's great that people are finally seeing who you really are.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,950
-How is molly?
-Good.

19
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,140
She,uh...kicked me out of the house this morning.

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,030
She said I was too stressed.

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,750
I just can't help it.

22
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,330
I feel like I need to be there.

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,850
Well,I made a packet of work for you to take home with you,

24
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,160
and I will be available all day except for the one hour

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,840
that I'm meeting with jodie.

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,490
That's right.

27
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,780
Your,uh,Y.E.T.I. Interviews start tomorrow,huh?

28
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,870
And with someone like jodie papadakis in your corner,

29
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,980
I'm sure you're gonna end up with something good.

30
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,710
I don't know.We'll see.

31
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,140
Come on,betty.I mean,you deserve this.

32
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,840
Believe me,if I had a job for you here at "mode,"

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,710
-you know I'd give it to you in a heartbeat.
-I know,I know.

34
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,260
I don't want to think about leaving "mode" yet,okay?

35
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,720
Just one step at a time.Water.

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,640
Ah,there you are.

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,670
So,betty,what's it like working for the most beloved man in the city?

38
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,970
Oh,very gmorous.

39
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,630
So did you hear about the new citi field?

40
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,430
Yeah,you're gonna be advertising on the jumbotron,huh?

41
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,710
Tomorrow night.I'm a sponsor.

42
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,110
I've got a luxury suite and tickets for you.

43
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,830
And they're field level.

44
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,370
Matt's gonna love this.

45
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,310
Yeah,I'll definitely see if molly's up to it.

46
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,730
Oh,I hope she is.I've arranged for her to throw out the first ball.

47
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,470
The press will eat that up.I think it will really help promote the wedding issue.

48
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,640
Uh,cal,I'm not really comfortable asking molly to do that.

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,370
All right,fine.Then you do it.

50
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,190
why does god hate me?

51
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,340
I'm a good person.

52
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,720
You are.And more important,you're pretty.

53
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,240
First hartley makes claire senior vice president of meade,

54
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,140
and now daniel's getting all the attention?

55
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,510
I should be the one going on "the view.

56
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,350
" You should!The wedding issue is yours.

57
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,020
Just because dumb danny was lucky enough to marry a woman with cancer,

58
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,440
I have to take the backseat?

59
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,920
It's criminal,willie.I am apoplectic.

60
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,020
Wilhelmina,you really need to rethink the cover of this wedding issue.

61
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,530
I dot know what it's saying.

62
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:54,860
Well,that's because it's speaking a language you don't understand--fashion.

63
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,590
it's generic.

64
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,030
And cal agrees with me.

65
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,920
So I'd like to see some other options,and as soon as possible,please.

66
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,420
-This is...
-disgraceful.

67
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,190
-This is...
-outrageous.

68
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,000
-This is...
-unspeakably odious!

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,100
-Oh,marc.
-Sorry.

70
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,570
Why would hartley give claire that kind of power?

71
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,160
There's a connection there.

72
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,760
We need to find out what that connection is and rip it apart.

73
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,770
hi!

74
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,630
Ooh,yogurt.Yummy.

75
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,160
Well,I figured it was time for your post-breakfast,pre-lunch slump.

76
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,370
-It is.
-And...

77
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,730
I have a surprise for you.

78
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,800
Oh,my gosh.Your first painting?

79
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,930
You finished it.

80
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,280
it's me...naked.

81
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,550
No,no,no.You have a-a thing over you.

82
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,860
You're,uh,you're draped.

83
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,780
It sorta looks like I'm naked.

84
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,070
What,you don't like it?

85
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,860
No,I do.It's beautiful.

86
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,060
You're very talented,but...

87
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,900
why'd you have to paint me?

88
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,270
Because you inspire me.

89
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,830
I'm in your apartment.

90
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,030
Mm-hmm,and,uh,and that's your toothbrush and,uh,the yogurt you like on the table...

91
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,980
And your robe is on the chair.

92
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,350
I should be wearing that.

93
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,830
Betty,I'm trying to tell you something.

94
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,200
Look,I know it seems like sometimes I don't know what I want,

95
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,610
but I do know that I want you.

96
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:26,230
And I see a future for us,together.

97
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,020
What are you saying?

98
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,830
-Are--are you asking--
-move in with me?

99
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,160
I mean,we already spend so much time together,and I love it.

100
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,670
But it just makes me want to spend more time with you.

101
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,050
are you freaked out?You look freaked out?

102
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,510
No,no,no,I'm not.I'm not freaked out.

103
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,050
It--it--it's exciting.It's just big.It's big.

104
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,010
I know it is.I'm just asking you to think about it,okay?

105
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,180
But try to think good things.

106
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,620
I will.

107
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,910
It really is very beautiful.

108
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,960
Oh,my god!That is hideous!

109
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,650
it's like looking at the butt of satan.

110
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,690
Oh,my eyes!

111
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,020
My eyes.

112
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,490
Options.

113
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,590
oh,thank you,wilhelmina.

114
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,440
Now I'd like to talk to you about your choice of stylist.

115
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,690
I have a problem...

116
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,820
hello,claire.

117
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,500
Victoria.

118
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,330
It's nice to see you.

119
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,450
Is it?

120
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,930
Uh,you must be victoria hartley.

121
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,180
I'm wilhelmina slater.

122
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,660
Nice to meet you.

123
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,490
If you'll excuse me,I'm,uh,meeting my ex-husband.

124
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,490
I prefer to do that before my muscle relaxer wears off.

125
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,220
Uh,so you were talking about my stylist choice?

126
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,350
It's fine.

127
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,100
It's fine.

128
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,240
Normally I don't like or notice older people,but that was interesting.

129
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,870
Hartley's ex-wife is clearly not a fan of claire'S.

130
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,420
That could be useful.

131
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,630
I don't want to put too much pressure on you,but this is a tough hiring year.

132
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,580
You're gonna have to blow tm away the second you walk into that room.

133
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,330
Okay,gotta go.

134
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,610
Jodie,I can't thank you enough for mentoring me.

135
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,040
Oh,hell.No,don't get me a cake.

136
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,390
I don't eat cake.Get me a boysenberry pie.

137
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,510
okay,I will.

138
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,520
God,I just...I can't believe it.

139
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,240
I mean,I might actually be leaving "mode.

140
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,000
" It's like everything in my life is changing.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,090
That's a good thing.

142
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:59,620
Now remember-- what sets you apart is who you are.

143
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,470
Let them see that.

144
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,140
Thank you.

145
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,520
Betty...

146
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,930
has,um...

147
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,020
has...marc said anything about me?

148
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,010
No,he hasn't,not to me.

149
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,050
you know what?That's fine.

150
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,440
What am I supposed to do,wait by the phone?

151
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,890
mija,you'reo quiet.

152
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,520
You worried about the interviews tomorrow?

153
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,780
A little.Uh,but I'M...

154
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,920
I'm more worried about what I need to tell U.

155
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,330
Matt asked me to move in with him.

156
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,900
I know it sounds sudden,but--but I told him I would talk to you first.

157
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,660
And,papi,I've been thinking,you'much so better now.

158
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,130
And nothing's gonna change.I mean,I can still help out.

159
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,470
And--and matt loves it here,so we'll be here all the time.

160
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,700
Well,then I think...

161
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,340
I think it's fine.

162
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,440
really?

163
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,510
What,you can grow and I can't?

164
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:13,600
I get it.My girls have lives of their own.

165
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,340
though I don't understand why no one's talked about marriage first.

166
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,260
Wow,look at you,living with a rich guy.

167
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,250
Hilda,stop.

168
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,330
Does he have a maid?

169
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,650
wait,so you're saying yes?

170
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,410
I'm saying yes.

171
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,660
I'm so glad.

172
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,710
I already painted the kitchen your favorite color.

173
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,450
yellow?

174
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,400
I thought it was purple.

175
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,290
Oh,I like purple.Purple's a nice color,too.

176
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:46,080
You are,like,the worst liar.Of course I painted it yellow.

177
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,410
what,what,what are you-- wh are you thinking?

178
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,520
Just that I'm really happy.

179
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,740
I'm interviewing for an editor position,I'm moving in with you--

180
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,870

187
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,030
We're on to your rotation,betty lou.

188
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,680
Do I have any messages?

189
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,450
Oh,it looks like you do,and it's urgent.

190
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,390
"Bradford needs to see you in his office immediately.

" Mandy,this is from six months ago.

194
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,580
Honestly,I did you a favor.

195
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,150
He had that awful red hair.

196
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,710
Are you sure I don't have any other messages?

197
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,060
Yes.That is it.

198
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,960
Why are you all up in my grundle?

199
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,820
I just saw henry get into a cab.

200
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,430
oh,my god.

201
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,690
Are you sure it was him?

202
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,810
Because it is pretty normal to think you see people after they die.

203
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,900
Mandy,henry didn't die.

204
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,590
He just dumped betty and moved to tucson to raise his bastard child with his slutty ex-girlfriend.

205
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,020
Oh,cool.

206
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,720
Why would he be here?

207
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,000
Hey,if he calls,do y want me to tell him that you're out

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,580
or that you're busy or that the tribe of mole people kidnapped you and made you their queen?

209
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,560
Could you please just put him through?Thanks.

We're very excited out the issue.

214
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,830
Um,actually,I probably shouldn't mention it,but,

215
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,080
uh,tracy reese has designed her first wedding dress for--

216
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,760
wow,speaking of weddings,how's the bride?

217
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,170

um,uh,thank you.Yeah,she's doing great.

220
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,690
Uh,but there's just one more thing I wanted to mention about the--the wedding issue...

221

But just to be clear,you're totally a changed man?

224
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,740
Because not too long a,you were a player.

225
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,780
-You were a dog.Right?
-Total player.

226
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,190
I don't know how you found time to put the magazine out.

227
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,010
But how about our boy now,huh?

228
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,600
I'll tell you,it looks like you've got some "faniels" out there.

229
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,750
-Oh,that's cute.
-You love that--faniels?

230
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,450
-Faniels.I do.It's cute.
-I thought it up this morning in the shower.

231
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,590
Don't you love it?

232
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,220
I'm really here to talk about the magazine,which--

233
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,690
you can talk about the magazine...

234
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,750
right after you give me a lap dance.

235
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,040
okay-- who cares?So what?Barbara's not here today.

236
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,240

Okay,here.

238
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,740
This is everything I could find out about victoria hartley,

239
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,840
including a lesbian rumor from a very reliable source.

240
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,820
And if you're gonna be friends with her,you're gonna need this.

241
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,450
Congratulations.You are now the youngest and most ethnic member of her tennis club.

242
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,360
Ah,perfect.

243
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,040
Okay,outfits.

244
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,850
Personally,I recommend the dark one because it's more forgiving of body fluids.

245
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,180
Not that you sweat.

You know,I got my first subscription to the "new york review" when I was 7.

274
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,890
John cheever was on the cover,and--and there was an article about estonia

275
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,740
and--and how the kroon had just replaced the soviet rubel.

276
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,840
I wasn't really like other kids.

277
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,080
I somit,metimes that was hard,but I did always have my magazines.

278
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,200
And the "new york review" took me out of my little corner in queens,

279
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,120
helped me imagine a much bigger world.

280
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,560
I just really hope that one day,I can give someone else that gift.

281
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,920
I'm sure you will.

282

284
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,020
you even got a smile from that woman from "harper's,"

285
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,260
and she recently had several deaths in her family.

286
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,660
did anyone love me?

287
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,960
To be honest,they thought you were selfish.

288
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,670
They were hurt you never called back.

289

what exactly happened between the two of you?

292
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,080
Oh,it was awful.There were kisses and boobs and lots of tears.

293
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,560
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

294
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,380
-How did it go?
-Terrible!

295
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,660

298
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,200

Well,you won't have to suffer yet.We won't know till tomorrow.

Henry's probably still there.

302
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:30,740
We could drop in and say hi.There's no harm in that,right?

303
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,730
What am I saying?He didn't even want me to know he was in new york.

304
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,320
I could take a peek.A peek?What am I,like,5?

305
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,780

-Make up your mind,woman!

Wilhelmina,I didn't know you were a member.

342
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,660
Well,I just joined,and go figure--my first day,and my partner doesn't show.

343
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,700
Oh,it'd be a shame to lose your court.

344
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,640
I'm always up for a game.Are you any good?

345
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,620
Because this one?She doesn't even t anymore.

346
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,140
I have to let you win,or you pout.

347
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,700
well,I can hold my own.

348
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,090
daniel!

349
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,800
We love you,daniel!

350
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,050
I love you,daniel.

351
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,290
why do you keep watching that?

352
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,980
It's fascinating.Man,you are gonna get so much tail when I'm gone.

353
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,840
Please don't talk like that.

354
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,870
you're a national treasure.

355
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,180
See?

356
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,680
Hey,what about a celebrity,like anne hathaway?

357
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,830
Too much baggage?

358
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,560
Molly,stop,okay?I...

359
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,870
I don't like this bit.

360
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,290
I'm sorry.

361
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,480
Okay,so,uh,you're still feeling up for the game?

362
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,710
Oh,yeah.I'm dying to get out.

363
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,070
It was an accident.

364
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,630
Enough!

365
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,200
Victoria,you win.

366
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,470
I...I must be rusty.

367
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,520
Oh,don't feel too bad.I've been playing since I was 3.

368
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,530
20 years is a long time.

369
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,630
so you and cal must've played a hell of a game.I...

370
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,320
he's so good at so many things.

371
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,490
Oh,cal never stuck around long enough for us to do anything together.

372
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,830
Oh,I know that story,sister.

373
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,030
So do you have anyone special in your life right now?

374
00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:00,250
Oh,just an r-ol-yead poodle named walter,and even he sleeps in another room.

375
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,800
what kind of world is it that two fabulous women like us are single?

376
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,740
Oh,if we're gonna talk men,we're gonna need alcohol.

377
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,570
oh,boy.Sorry.

378
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,890
Somehow this ended up on my desk.

379
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,730
"Daniel,if you want to talk,my number's sewn on the bow.

380
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,590
" Convenient.

381
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,950
Jersey area code.

382
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,540
All right,this is getting out of control.

383
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,450
All this female attention is really starting to get to molly.

384
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,340
I mean,she--she makes these jokes about other women.

385
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,740
I-I think she's becoming obsessed about who I'm gonna be with after...

386
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,540
she...

387
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,630
llwe,maybe it helps molly to think about you being with someone else.

388
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,010
That way,she doesn't have to worry that you'll be lonely.

389
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,720
I can't think about life after molly.

390
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,680
I mean,I-I...

391
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,100
I try every day not to think about it.

392
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,090
Okay,so we're going to the game with your ex-boyfriend.

393
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,180
I sort of got roped into it.But we don't have to go.

394
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,670
I mean,I could just tell him that you're sick.

395
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,690
You coughed earlier.

396
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,940
No,it's okay.I'm fine with it.

397
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,280
-Really?
-Yeah,let's do it.

398
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,720
You know what?You're kinda great.

399
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,840
hi,jodie.

400
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,800
Oh,my god.

401
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,990
daniel.

402
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,240
I'm gonna be an editor.

403
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,190
It's not official yet.

404
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,550
Uh,but jodie just called and--and

405
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,590
said that the "new york review" wants to call me tomorrow and make an offer.

406
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,570
I know.

407
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,580
I mean,that'S...incredible.

408
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,690
The "new york review"
never hires anyone.

409
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,220
Jodie couldn't believe it either.

410
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,970
I can.

411
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,990
I mean,they saw what I see...

412
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,290
every day.

413
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,650
daniel,I don't know what to say.

414
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,770
I do.

415
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,300
Thank you,betty...

416
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,190
for everything.

417
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,830
So how am I gonna find
someone as good as you?

418
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,890
You won'T.

419
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,850
but I can help you find a close second.

420
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,590
and now,mets fans,please
turn your attention

421
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,880
to the field for r
celebrity first pitch.

422
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,040

423
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,400
{\a6}as "mode" magazine's
editor-in-chief daniel meade...

424
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,070

00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,770
Nice throw.

428
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:40,900
I've got a taste for champagne
and there's this fortune

429
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,320
I've,uh,I've got something for you.

430
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,820
Really?  A credit card?

431
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,380
It's a key to our apartment.

432
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,280
- Sorry we're late.
- My fault.

433
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,330
But we're girls,right,betty?

434
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,190
Uh,henry,this is matt.  Matt,henry.

435
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,760
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

436
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,010
- And chloe.  - Hi,I'm chloe.
- Hi,chloe. How are you?

437
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,820
So,henry,I've,uh,heard a lot about you.

438
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,060
Betty says you're an accountant.

439
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,090
Yeah,I work for a small firm in tucson.

440
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,650
He does the mayor's taxes.

441
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,370
Well,the--the firm
does his taxes.

442
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,930
what do you do?

443
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,470
Uh,not much of anything right now.

444
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,050
That's not true.  You're
an--you're a painter.

445
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:24,170
Matt's a painter,and he's very good.

446
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,580
And he has a law degree.

447
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,360
Uh,part of a law degree.

448
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,770
Still,you could have one if you wanted.

449
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,750
stop selling matt.  He's great.

450
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,390
Should I mention he's
rich?  No,that's gross.

451
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,720
Maybe there's a way for
it to come up organically.

452
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,610
Seriously,I whipped this boy into shape.

453
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,090
You should take a look at his six-pack.

454
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,440
Look at this.  Look at it.

455
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,770
Chloe,they don't want to see my abs.

456
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,770
- Why?  Why not?
- No,really.  They don'T.

457
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,280
Yeah,you know,I should
really work out more.

458
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,190
I'm--I'm
so lazy.

459
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,600
Y-y--I wouldn't say
you're lazy.  Come on.

460
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,440
Well,okay,I eat too much junk food.

461
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,340
Now it all goes right here.

462
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,100
Please don't make your belly
button talk.  Please don'T.

463
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,450
Look,look.  I'm skinny-fat.

464
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,500
Feed me.

465
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,200
that's good.  That's good.

466
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,930
molly.

467
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:35,660
Cara!  Oh,my god.  How are you?

468
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,750
Good.  Fine.

469
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,500
Daniel,this is cara from school.

470
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,750
Hey,nice to meet you.

471
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,970
Cara...

472
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,040
cara is such an amazing human being.

473
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,110
You should see her with the kids.

474
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,100
I've wanted you guys
to meet for,like,ever.

475
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,950
Oh,my god.  You've
got to get to know her.

476
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,090
You're gonna love her.

477
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,330
And you two have so much in common.

478
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,060
You both went to
harvard,you're both jocks,

479
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,870
and you both hate
desserts,which is stupid.

480
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,390
Molly,what are you doing?

481
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,730
- Nothing.
- I mean,this is crazy.

482
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,310
Look,I'm sorry,cara.

483
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,650
I'm sure you're very nice.

484
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,860
I-I don't want to go out with you.

485
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,110
- I don't know what he means.
- Neither do I.

486
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,970
Um,I should get back to
andrew...  my husband.

487
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,430
So this preschool we put
nate in is really progressive.

488
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,350
And the first day I had to pick him
up, he walks out of the school and goes,

489
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,540
"where's other daddy?

490
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,050
" I love that story.

491
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,970
henry's so thoughtful.

492
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,190
I really like his hair this way.

493
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,440
- ah,two waters.
- oh,thanks.

494
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,840
- thank you.
- And a hot dog.

495
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,310
and with extra onions,even
though we're gonna kiss later.

496
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,880
was henry staring at me?

497
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,820
God,he really looks good.

498
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,500
I forgot how nice his has arE.

499
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,810
- are you okay?
- Uh,yeah,I'm fine.

500
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,860
Stop it,betty.  This
is not a competition.

501
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,300
You are with matt,and henry
is with his dumb girlfriend.

502
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,710
Oh,stop it.  That's mean.

503
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,420
henry just got this
amazing new apartment.

504
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:25,640
Oh,well,it's big,but it came with
a family of western banded geckos.

505
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,980
interesting fact,they're one of the
few lizards   that has moveable eyelids.

506
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,530
- Really?
- The only problem is that he's moving further away from me.

507
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,910
Well,uh...  we have
some,uh,big news,too.

508
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,970
Yes,of course.

509
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,940
Um,I wasn't gonna say
anything yet,but...

510
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,070
I got offered an editor
position at the "new york review.

511
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,680
" That's amazing.

512
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,440
- Betty,that's been your dream job forever.
- I know.

513
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,490
When do you start?  Why
didn't you say anything?

514
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,760
Well,I-I didn't want to jinx it.

515
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,260
It's not official ye

516
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,040
well,that went pretty well.

517
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,570
maybe we could go to dinner
with them before they leave.

518
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,360
Although that might be
difficult with chloe.

519
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,010
She eats eight small meals a day.

520
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,540
Honestly,I don't really get her for him.

521
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,490
I mean,she's nice,but
not really his type.

522
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,460
What's wrong?  Is everything
okay?  Was that too weird for you?

523
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,680
Henry's nice.

524
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,310
The only weird thing is
that you didn't even once

525
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,660
mention the fact that
we're moving in together.

526
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,740
Did you,uh,did you forget?

527
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,460
No,no,I didn't forget.

528
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,180
Well,what was it then?

529
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,760
Did you...

530
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,310
not want henry to know for some reason?

531
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,780
- So rean?
- I don't know.  Maybe you were,you know...

532
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,600
leaving the door open
for him or something.

533
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,160
Matt,that's crazy.  I'm with you.

534
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,020
Look,I'm sorry I didn't say anything.

535
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,990
Maybe I did forget for one minute.

536
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,240
But it doesn't mean
anything more than that.

537
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,320
No.  no,you're right.  I'm sorry.

538
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,180
Maybe meeting henry was a
little harder than I thought.

539
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,870
- Let's--let's just forget
about it,okay?  - Okay.

540
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,330
You,uh,still want to move in,right?

541
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,920
Yes,yes,of course.

542
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,970
let's get out of this rain,hmm?

543
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:30,610
ever since this world began
there is nothing sadder

544
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:39,170
than a one-man woman
lookin' for the man

545
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:51,350
that got away away

546
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,480
ah,excuse me.

547
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,990
claire meade.

548
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,890
Leave me alone,you pill-popping hag.

549
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:07,160
I'm sorry.  That was
completely inappropriate.

550
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,290
Claire and I have A...

551
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,850
complicated relationship.

552
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,800
Oh,you don't have to tell me.

553
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,320
That bitch almost ruined my marriage.

554
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,110
I mean,before I did.

555
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,910
Okay,I have had too much to drink.

556
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:23,480
well,victoria,you're
gonna have to tell me more.

557
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,510
oh,god.

558
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:28,190
oh,it was so long ago.

559
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,380
And,you know,at
werst,were all so close--

560
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,920
the meades and the hartleys.

561
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,300
Unfortunately,cal and claire
got a little too close.

562
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,240
Oh,you poor thing.

563
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,120
There was an affair?

564
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,710
Worse.

565
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,600
There was a baby.

566
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,360
I don't know,betty.  Moving in
with matt's a pretty big deal.

567
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,710
How could it just not come up?

568
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:01,420
I don't know.  I don't know.

569
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,990
Was matt right?  Was I trying to
leave some door open for henry?

570
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,220
You're the only one who can answer that.

571
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,480
I love matt.  I do.

572
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,770
It's just,when I saw hen...

573
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,080
it took my breath away.

574
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,510
It took me right
back to that place--

575
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,410
the way I used to feel when I saw him,

576
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:24,300
those same butterflies in my stomach.

577
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,040
Do you remember the pain you felt,too?

578
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,120
'Cause I do.

579
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,800
All I'm saying is...

580
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,750
before henry came along,yowere so
excited about moving in with matt.

581
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,150
- I still am.
- Then remind yourself of something.

582
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,040
Henry isn't real.

583
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,260
He lives 2,000 miles away.

584
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,510
He's got a kid.  He's got a girlfriend.

585
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,520
trust me,just because a
guy makes your heart flutter

586
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,480
does not mean that you're
supposed to be with them.

587
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,360
I'm not saying I want to be with him.

588
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,670
I'm with matt.

589
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,900
And I don't want to screw that up.

590
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,230
Okay,then...don't see henry again.

591
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,850
I'm sorry.

592
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,370
I...I don't know what I was thinking.

593
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,580
Hey,maybe you should go out with her.

594
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,860
I mean,you already have a
funny story to break the ice.

595
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,010
Now see?  That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

596
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,900
When you do that,can you blame
me for jumping to conclusis?

597
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,710
You keep making these comments
about me being with someone else.

598
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,340
I'm sorry.

599
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,460
I know this isn't easy for you.

600
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,730
For either of us,molly.

601
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,830
The only thing I care about
is the time we have left.

602
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,890
I don't care about anything else.

603
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,360
I don't want you worrying for one second

604
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,190
about me being lonely or anything.

605
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,250
You want to know why I
make all those stupid jokes?

606
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,280
because I am trying to wrap my head

607
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,430
around the worst thing I can imagine...

608
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,910
that I will die,and
you will meet someone

609
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,240
and move on and forget me.

610
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,680
- Molly...
- that's the thing I'm most afraid of...

611
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,580
that the world will
just go on without me,

612
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,260
and everyone will forget I was here.

613
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,680
I promise you...

614
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:21,460
I will never,ever forget you.

615
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,810
hi,jodie.  I'm leaving
you another message.

616
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:43,130
Sorry.  But I-I still ven't heard
from the "new york review" yet.

617
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:48,170
Call me.  Um,okay.  Bye.

618
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,320
oh,my god.  You're not gonna believe it.

619
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,280
I got three ofrs.  it's
a total bidding war.

620
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,760
It's like I'm yentl,and mandy patinkin,

621
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,520
amy irving and the talmud are
all vying for my attention.

622
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,130
Congratulations.  That's really great.

623
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,150
What about you?  Have
you heard anything?

624
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,170
well,I guess I can tell you.

625
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,200
Jodie called me yesterday,

626
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,770
and the "new york review" is supposed
to make me an offer today,but--

627
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,880
oh,I knew you got an offer!

628
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,290
I got nothing,nothing.

629
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:38,150
- What?
- I lied to get you to talk.

630
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,700
Nobody wants me,betty.  Nobody's called.

631
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,420
And I gave such a good
interview at "vogue.

632
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,640
" marc,you are so talented.

633
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,740
Don't!  My flesh rots
where you touch it.

634
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,820
It's just that I wanted it so much.

635
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:57,470
And...I worked so hard.

636
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:01,900
And I would've made the best
junior editor "vogue" has ever seen.

637
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,160
Yeah.  You would.

638
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,920
They should know that.

639
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,830
Why don't you call 'em?

640
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:14,130
Tell them just who marc st.  James is.

641
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,420
What do you got to lose?

642
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,450
You're right.

643
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,360
If they're gonna reject me,then
they have to tell me why.

644
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,110
Thanks.

645
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,660
this is betty suarez.

646
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:00,180
Uh,I interviewed with
erika,and I was wondering if...

647
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,290
well,do you mind me asking why?

648
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,360
You stole my job?

649
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,520
I didn't steal it.

650
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,300
I just convinced them
to hire me instead.

651
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,360
Yeah,that's sort of like stealing.

652
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,240
Please don't shout.

653
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,150
I was in such a good mood.

654
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,080
All I digivewas them the opportunity

655
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,940
to hire me at a very reduced salary.

656
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,990
But unfortunately,it
still ate into the budget

657
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:43,320
for the two junior editor positions.

658
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,050
One of which was supposed to be mine!

659
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,070
I'm sorry,betty.

660
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,950
Do you know how hard it was to sit back

661
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,690
and watch some cheery
20-something just waltz in

662
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,430
and take what I dreamed
of my whole career?

663
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,420
Jodie,you were my hero.

664
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,250
I idolized you.

665
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,300
It's been a crappy year.

666
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:14,750
I lost my 401,my cat died,and
I'm hitting on gay guys,

667
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:20,000
and I am just so tired of helping
other people get what they want.

668
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,720
Who said I'm done?

669
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,500
I guess you aren'T.

670
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:37,500
Hey,willie.  I just wanted
to see how you were doing.

671
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,400
My entire body has nnis elbow,

672
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,830
I have a hangover that's
worthy of a college freshman,

673
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,710
but I'm feeling wonderful,

674
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,970
because I have information

675
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:51,460
that will split up old man
hartley and grandma meade.

676
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,870
Oh,marc.  I'm happy.

677
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,390
Why does it look like your
feelings are different than mine?

678
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,390
I guess because of
my Y.E.T.I.Interviews.

679
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,820
You didn't get any offers?

680
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,040
Well,times are tough,darling.

681
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,100
Just be grateful you have a job.

682
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,660
But I did get an offer...

683
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,780
from "vogue.

684
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,230
" I start in two weeks.

685
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,960
anyway,matt,um...

686
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,170
sorry to cry on your voice mail.

687
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,540
You probably won't get this
till after your art class anyway.

688
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:36,050
I just...  wanted to tell
someone what happened.

689
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,360
Henry Grubstick is
enjoying a Creamsicle Float

690
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,870
in City Park on his last night in NYC!

691
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,090
Did you bring french fries?

692
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,310
Something better.

693
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,590
I wanted to show you the new
cover of the wedding issue.

694
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:16,090
it's gonna sell millions.

695
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,980
I promise you...

696
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,190
everyone will know molly was here.

697
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,300
thank you.

698
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:34,220
* I found god on the corner
of first and amistad *

699
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,570
do I look fat?

700
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,340
* all alone *

701
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,020
I can't believe she stole your job.

702
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,340
I know.

703
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,270
I'll be fine.  I'll be fine.

704
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,990
I just...needed somebody to talk to.

705
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,000
Well,I'm glad you called me.

706
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,150
Why do you think I was updating
my facebook status so much?

707
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,280
I wanted you to find me.

708
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,390
It took you 3 days,11
hours and 27 minutes.

709
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:04,520
- I'm not good with technology.
- yes,you are.

710
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,320
I have to tell you something.

711
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,410
I'm moving in with matt.

712
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,900
Do you love him?

713
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,460
I do.

714
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,750
Henry,what we had was
amazing and exciting.

715
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:32,090
Probably because you were my first love,

716
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:36,490
and probably because it
always felt so impossible.

717
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:40,780
What I have with matt
is totally different...

718
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,510
but it's really good.

719
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,490
Matt's a great guy.

720
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,380
He is.

721
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,360
And chloe is a great girl.

722
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,300
I don't know why I'm with her.

723
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,330
The only thing we have in common is
that we can both do one-armed push-ups.

724
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,730
she does look strong.

725
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,520
I don't know if I'm ever gonna
feel this way about anyone else.

726
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,940
Me,neither.

727
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,860
So what do we do?

728
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,410
Well...I guess I have to just accept

729
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,350
that I'm always gonna be a
little bit in love with you.

730
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,230
And that's okay...

731
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,770
as long as it doesn't
keep us from moving on.

732
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:38,700
You're pretty damn smart,you know that?

733
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:48,700
so...I guess this is good-bye...

734
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,790
again.

735
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,530
I guess so.

736
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:57,060
* lying on the floor  *

737
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,590
* where were you?  *

738
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,760
* Where were you?  *

739
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,500
* Lost and insecure  *

740
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,010
* you found me,you found me  *

741
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,470
* lying on the floor  *

742
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:15,720
* surroded,surrounded
why'd you have to wait? *

743
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,190
* Where were you? *

744
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,570
* Where were you? *

745
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,910
* Lying on the floor  *

746
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:28,180
* surrounded,surrounded
why'd you have to wait? *

747
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:34,370
* Where were you?Where were
you?Just a little late  *

748
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:43,450
* you found me you found me  *

749
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:49,230
* why'd you have to wait to find me? *
