1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,900
Previously On Ugly Betty,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,000
You Are The Gym Teacher?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Yes.

4
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,900
Is There Any Chance That You Know 
Who My Father Is?

5
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,100
I Didn't See Anything
But The ??? Bird Tattoo On His Ass.

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,000
??? Is My Father.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,700
Daddy?

8
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,400
Daughter?

9
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,200
I'm Having Your Father's Child.

10
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,100
My Only Concern Is Giving It 
Everything It Deserves.

11
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,000
And What Would That Be?

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,300
One-Third 

13
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,000
Of The Mead Empire.

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,700
Henry.

15
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,600
You Are Not In Tucson?

16
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,600
I'm Going Back.

17
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:25,600
What?

18
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,600
My Brother's Totally ??? On Your Girlfriend.

19
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,700
I'm Not A Big Believer 
In This Whole Fantasy Thing

20
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,300
But I Believe That You Want To Have 
A Bit Of Yours.

21
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm Lucky.

22
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,900
Except For The Part When Henry's 
Leaving Me After His Baby's Born.

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,700
Oh, God.

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,900
Did You Hear Her
Crying Last Night?

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,500
<I>Ay, It's Only Been
Two Weeks, Papi.</I>

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,700
She Loved Henry.
She Needs To Go Through This.

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,500
I Just Wish There Were
Something We Could Do.

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,800
- There Is. You Can Buy More Tissues. 
- Hi.

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Hilda, You're Out
Of Your Puffy Eye Cream Stuff.

30
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,500
- Sorry. 
- Oh, Don't Worry, Aunt Betty. I'm On It.

31
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,000
Well,
I Hope You're Hungry,

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,700
'Cause You're Just In Time
For Eggs A La Hilda.

33
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,300
- What's Eggs A La Hilda?
- It's Scrambled Eggs.

34
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,500
<I>Papi,
I Don't Want To Hear It.</I>

35
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,400
You're Sick.
I'm Making Breakfast.

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,500
<I>- Hilda, I'm Not Very Hungry. 
- Amor, You've Barely Eaten Since 
Henry Went Back To Tucson.</I>

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,400
It's True, Aunt Betty.

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
<I>You've Been Looking
Really Skinny.</I>

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,200
- That's Supposed To Sound Bad.
- Guys, You're All Being So Sweet,

40
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,400
But I Do Not Want You
Worrying About Me, Okay?

41
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,800
Henry And I Agreed
A Clean Break Would Be Best.

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,600
You Know, When I Break Up
With A Guy...

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,400
I Like To Get A Little Bit Scary
So He Doesn't Forget Me.

44
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,000
All Right, Justin, Come On.
We Gotta Go.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,500
- I Gotta Get Ready For 
The P.T.A. Thing This Morning. 
- Since When Are You On The P.T.A.?

46
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,700
- Since She Has A Crush On My Gym Teacher. 
- What? Who? Tony? He's Okay.

47
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,900
- Why? Did He Say Something? 
Do You Think He Likes Me? 
- What's Not To Like?

48
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,600
Oh, My God. He's Such A Good...
Mwah. Mwah. Mwah.

49
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,600
- Such A Good Boy. Here. Have Some
Juice A La Hilda. 
- What Is This?

50
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,900
It's Juice.

51
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,700
<I>Mija, You Seem Tired.</I>

52
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,200
Can't You Take
A Little Time Off Work?

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,500
No. Are You Kidding?
Work Is The Only Thing

54
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,900
That Kind Of Keeps My Mind
Off Of Henry.

55
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,500
I'm Secretly Hoping
The "Mode" Drama Doesn't End.

56
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,800
Will The Drama
At "Mode" Ever End?

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,000
Fashion Diva
And Headline Stealer

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,900
Wilhelmina Slater
Is Back On The Scene

59
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,100
With Child... Ish.

60
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,900
She'll Be Using
An Unnamed Surrogate

61
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,000
To Birth The Baby.

62
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,700
Wilhelmina... A Mother Again?
She's Certainly Been Called One.

63
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,900
The Babe Was Confirmed To Be
The Spawn Of Bradford Meade,

64
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,300
Who Gifted Wilhelmina
With His Frozen Swimmers

65
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,900
Just Before His Death.

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And They Say Romance Is Dead.

67
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,400
Will La Slater
Return To "Mode"?

68
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,700
<I>Will The Baby Own A Share
Of The Meade Fortune?</I>

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,900
Insiders Tell Me

70
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,900
<I>The Meades Are Fighting Her
Tooth And French Tip Nail</I>

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,100
<I>With A Legal Decision
Expected This Morning.</I>

72
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,100
No, Daniel Is Not Available.

73
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,900
- We Will Be Releasing A Statement
This Afternoon. 
- Any News Yet?

74
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
No, They're On The Phone
With The Lawyer Right Now.

75
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,800
I Don't Know.
Maybe The News Will Be Good.

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,700
- Maybe Wilhelmina Will Have Lost. 
- Wilhelmina Never Loses.

77
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,800
Oh, Why Did I Agree
To Have This Baby?

78
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
Christina,
You Didn't Have A Choice.

79
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,300
- You Needed The Money For Stuart's Operation.
- Ohh, Oh. Claire Meade Looked At Me.

80
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,800
- She Hates Me. I Don't Blame Her. 
- She Doesn't Hate You. And She'll 
Totally Understand.

81
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,000
Look, Look, Look.
They're Coming Out Now.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,500
Just Take A Deep Breath...

83
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,100
Look Her In The Eye
And Just Explain It...

84
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,200
So... Is It Bad?

85
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,400
It's Terrible.
Our Father's Will Divided

86
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,000
The Company Evenly
Among His Children.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,900
- Unfortunately, That Includes 
Future Children? 
- None Of This Makes Any Sense.

88
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,300
Bradford Never Wanted
To Have Another Child,

89
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,600
- <I>And Now To Have One With Her? 
- It's Happening, And Until That Kid Turns 18,</I>

90
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,700
Wilhelmina Controls
A Third Of This Company.

91
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,600
So... That Means?

92
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,700
Wilhelmina Is Back.

93
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,500
Let's Do This Bitch.

94
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,400
<I>If She Tries Anything,
Call Security.</I>

95
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
I Can Take Her.

96
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,400
What? I Can.

97
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,600
Whatever Happens,
I'm Right Here.

98
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,900
Family Meade,
I Just Want To Say,

99
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,800
How Thrilled And Honored
I Am To Be Back Here.

100
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,600
Today Is A New Day,

101
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,400
And I Hope We Can All
Put The Past Behind Us.

102
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,200
Wonderful Seeing You All.

103
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,900
<I>Oh, Now That Was Fun.</I>

104
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,100
Am I Smiling? I Can't Tell.

105
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,200
I Think You Are.
Oh, Willie...

106
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,700
It's So Good
To Be Back

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And To Have
Health Insurance Again,

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,100
Because I Have
This Weird Mole Thing.

109
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,000
But Daniel Still Runs "Mode,"
And Alexis Still Runs Meade.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,100
What's Our Next Move?

111
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,500
To Divide The House Of Meade.

112
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,300
We'll Start
With The Weakest Link.

113
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,800
Did You See The Look
On Daniel's Face?

114
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,600
Terror.

115
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,300
If There's One Thing I Know
How To Do, It's Manipulate Fear.

116
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,800
You Are A Horror Movie
I Wish Would Never End.

117
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,200
I Can't Believe
This Is Happening.

118
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,600
<I>I Mean, I've Had Nightmares
About Her Coming Back.</I>

119
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,900
They Usually End With Her
Stabbing Me With A Stiletto

120
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,900
And Turning Into A-Poof!
Bat.

121
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,100
- Daniel, Keep It Together. 
- How Can I? She's Been After My Job 
Since I Started Here.

122
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,500
Well, She's Not Gonna Get It,
So Stop Panting.

123
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,700
Wilhelmina Has No Creative Input
Here Whatsoever.

124
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,200
She's Nothing More Than
A Chanel Suit With An Office.

125
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,100
Yes, But She's One-Third
Of This Company,

126
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,300
<I>And She's Got
The Devil On Her Side.</I>

127
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah, But The Devil
Doesn't Get A Vote.

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,800
There's Two Of Us,
And There's One Of Her.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,300
Do You Know What?
You're Right.

130
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,100
- It's Two Against One.
- Exactly, So Relax.

131
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
We Won't Make A Move
Without One Another.

132
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,700
Whew.

133
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,700
Mrs. Meade,
I'm Taking Lunch Orders.

134
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,600
- Could I Get You Something? 
- Actually, I Was Just About To Call You.

135
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,100
There Is Something
You Can Do For Me.

136
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,600
- <I>You Can Write An Article
For "Hot Flash." 
- An Article?</I>

137
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,200
Yes. I'm Short
Four Pages Of Content.

138
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,600
Now I Know "Hot Flash" Is
A Magazine For Older Women,

139
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,000
But You Could Give It
Its Youth Perspective.

140
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,700
300 Words
By Tomorrow Morning.

141
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,600
Yeah. Okay.
Uh, I Can Do This.

142
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,000
So, Like, When You Say,
"Youth Perspective,"

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,100
What Does That Mean Exactly?

144
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,400
Betty, Betty,
You're The Writer.

145
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,300
Figure It Out.

146
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,300
I'm The Writer.

147
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,600
Okay.

148
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
Uh, Okay.

149
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,200
Oh, And, Mrs. Meade?

150
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,500
Thank You.

151
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
You're Welcome.

152
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,200
Mad Props
On The Dramatic Entrance.

153
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,700
I Wanted To Use A Strobe Light
As We Hit The Tube,

154
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,600
But Wil Said
It Was Over-The-Top.

155
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,900
<I>- O- M-G, We Have So Much
To Catch Up On. 
- I Know.</I>

156
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,600
- Me First.
- Oh.

157
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,100
You Know How I've Been
Working With My Father,

158
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,600
Gene Simmons From Kiss,
On A New Reality Show?

159
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,900
Well, Prepare Yo'self.

160
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,000
<I>* This Is The Story</I>

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,800
<I>* The Story Is True</I>

162
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,000
<I>* How I Found My Daughter</I>

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,700
<I>* He Never Even Knew-Ew</I>

164
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,500
<I>* She Tracked Me Down
* With Only One Clue</I>

165
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,300
<I>* It Was On My Butt</I>

166
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,200
<I>* That Fateful</I>

167
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,300
<I>* Tattoo
* Tattoo</I>

168
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,200
<I>* On My Butt
* What? What?</I>

169
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,800
<I>"Daddy's Little Girl."</I>

170
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Mandy...

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,100
You're Gonna Be
A Reality Tv Star.

172
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,300
It's What Every Pretty Girl With
No Specific Talent Dreams Of.

173
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,100
I Know, Right?
And Every Episode,

174
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,200
We Do A New Fun,
Father-Daughter Activity.

175
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,300
You Know, Like Camping
Or Riding Bikes

176
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,800
- Or Trashing A Hotel Room. 
- Oh, You Know What? 
Every Successful Tv Show Has

177
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,700
- A Shticky, Gay Best Friend Sidekick. 
- No. No, No, Marc. You Can't Be On The Show.

178
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,900
Come On. Why Not?
Marc And Amanda.

179
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,400
We're So Funny Together.
Everyone Says So.

180
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,300
Okay.

181
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,900
There's No Other Way
To Tell You This-

182
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,500
You Know How, In Real Life,
You're Always So Jumpy

183
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,700
And Bopping Your Head
And Moving Around...

184
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,300
Like...

185
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
Well,
That Makes You Blurry,

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,100
And On Tv, People Can
Actually See Your Face.

187
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,200
Wow.

188
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,800
You're Cute,
But You're Not Tv Cute.

189
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,200
- I Am So Glad I Got That Off My Chest. 
I Feel So Much Better. 
- Oh.

190
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,900
- You Wanna Watch It Again?
- Sure.

191
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,900
Okay, Eight Turkey,
Six Veggie,

192
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,200
Four Chicken Curry Salad

193
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,700
- And Two Salami.
- Mm-Hmm.

194
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,300
Man, You Sure Are
Hungry Today.

195
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Hey, That's The First Time
I've Ever Gotten A Smile

196
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,800
- Off That Joke. 
- Well, Today Has Turned Out To 
Be Not So Terrible.

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,500
Claire Meade Asked Me To Write
An Article For "Hot Flash."

198
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,200
Hey, That's A Big Deal.

199
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,000
- Yeah. I Guess It Is A Big Deal.
- Here, Have A Black-And-White Cookie.

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,300
- I Haven't Even Told Anybody Yet. 
- Oh, I'm The First Person You Told, Huh?

201
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,900
- Mm-Hmm.
- Figures.

202
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,400
- What Does That Mean?
- You Tell Me Everything.

203
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,600
- No, I Don't.
- Yes, You Do.

204
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,400
- No, I Don't.
- Oh, Yes, You Do.

205
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,900
You're Always Down Here,
Telling Me About Your Day,

206
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,300
- Flirting, Ordering Sandwiches... 
- Uh, It's A Sandwich Shop, And I Wasn't Flirting.

207
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,200
Oh, Come On. Every Time
I Turn Around, You're There.

208
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,800
You Know, You're Kind
Of Stalking Me A Little Bit.

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,500
Uh... What?

210
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
You Like Me.
There's Nothing Wrong With That.

211
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,400
- Just Admit It.
- You Are Insane.

212
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Come On. You'll Feel Better
If You Say It Out Loud.

213
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,900
- You Want Me To Be Your Rebound Guy.
- I Came Down Here For Sandwiches,

214
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,400
And All Of The Sudden,
You're My Rebound Guy?

215
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,500
Gio, I Just Got
Out Of A Relation-

216
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Mm.

Guess Who Ordered The Tongue
At Gio's Deli?

224
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,000
Betty Whorez Is Out Of Control!

225
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,900
As Far As The November Cover
Is Concerned, I Was-

226
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,900
I'm Sorry I'm Late.
I Must Not Have Gotten The Memo.

227
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,600
No, Wilhelmina.
You Weren't Invited.

228
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,700
I Realize That,

229
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,800
And I Was Speaking
To My Lawyer,

230
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,700
And Apparently, I Have
Every Legal Right To Observe.

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,100
Okay, Fine, But You Have
No Official Capacity At "Mode,"

232
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,600
- And That Means Zero Input.
- I Understand.

233
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,400
I'm Merely Someone
Who Controls

234
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,300
One-Third
Of The Parent Corporation,

235
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,600
Which Owns Everything
And Everyone In Here.

236
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,400
But You Won't Even Notice Me.
Quiet As A Mouse.

237
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,500
Oh, My God.
It Looks Like She's Eating Him.

238
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,800
I'm Gonna Pee.

239
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,700
<I>She Does Realize That
That's The Sandwich Guy</I>

240
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,000
And Not An Actual Sandwich,
Right?

241
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,900
Oh, Mandy,
How I've Missed This.

242
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,100
I Know You Two Sent
That Picture Around,

243
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,300
And I Just Want To Say-

244
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,400
Betty, We Are So Glad
You Finally Found A Rebound Guy.

245
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,000
- I Mean, You And Henry?
- Mismatch

246
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
One Time I Saw Him Changing
His Shirt In The Bathroom,

247
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And I Wasn't Staring,

248
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
And I Definitely
Did Not Take A Picture,

249
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,600
<I>But For A Nerd Accountant,
He Has Body Karate.</I>

250
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,700
Ooh.
But Gio Smells Like Salami.

251
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,900
- And He's Perfect For You!
- Gio Is Not My Rebound Guy,

252
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,700
And I Have An Article
To Write Today,

253
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,100
So I Don't
Have Time For Your Games.

254
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,100
If You Could Just Write
A Retraction E-Mail,

255
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,500
- Send It Out-
- Betty, Gio Loves You.

256
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,300
And That's A Direct Quote From
The Stall In The Men's Room.

257
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,600
Oh.

258
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,600
Now For The November Cover,

259
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,400
I Was Thinking
We'd Be A Little Bit More Bold.

260
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,600
Ladies, Gentlemen,
I Give You...

261
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,900
The W-

262
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,200
The War Iss-The War Issue.

263
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,800
Sexy Soldiers
Surrounded By Danger.

264
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,400
Definitely Gonna Keep
The Focus On Fashion,

265
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,100
But, Uh, With A Bit More
Political Edge, As Well.

266
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,000
I Don't Know.
It Seems A Little Too Risky.

267
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,400
- I Think It's Fantastic.
- You Don't Get To Talk.

268
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,200
- Uh, Wait, Uh, You Think It's Good? 
- I Think It's Genius.

269
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,700
In Fact, It's So Genius

270
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,600
That "Elle" Is Doing
The Exact Same Thing,

271
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,100
Uh, A Month Earlier,

272
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,600
But I'm Sure You've Got
Some Terrific Backup Ideas.

273
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,900
Yeah. Yes, I Do.
Of Course.

274
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,500
Um, We Could...

275
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,700
The...

276
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,500
Backup Ideas For The Cover...

277
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,000
We're Thinkin', Uh,
We Might...

278
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,200
Um... Yeah.

279
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,400
Uh, C-W-Why Don't We,
Uh, Just Take Five Minutes?

280
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Uh, I'll Be Right Back.

281
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,500
Get It Together, Daniel.
Come On.

282
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,900
Aren't You Supposed
To Be In A Meeting?

283
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,000
Wilhelmina Is In There,
And She Is Freaking Me Out.

284
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,400
What Are You Doing
In The Men's Room?

285
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,800
Ugh. There Was
A Graffiti Situation.

286
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,600
Marc Wrote A Very Raunchy Poem
About Me And Gio.

287
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,800
It Was More Of A Haiku, Really.
Anyway, I Took Care Of It.

288
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,500
Shouldn't You Be Writing
Your Article?

289
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,100
How Do You Know About That?

290
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,300
Daniel?

291
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,400
Did You Tell Your Mother
To Give Me That Article?

292
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
I Know I'm Self-Involved,
But Even I Could Tell

293
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,900
You Needed Some Cheering Up...

294
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,800
- And Besides, You're Gonna Do Great.
- Great? I Haven't Written Anything Yet.

295
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,800
I've Had A Few Distractions.

296
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,500
Well, Stop That. Get Back
In There And Start Writing.

297
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,100
Fine. You Get Back In There
And Run That Meeting,

298
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,300
- And Don't Let Wilhelmina Get To You. 
- Yeah. We Can Do This.

299
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Yes, We Can.

300
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,100
Uh, That Was Unexpected.

301
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,900
Yeah. Let's Pretend That
That Didn't Happen.

302
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,500
- Here You Go. Oh, Hey, Hilda. 
- Hi.

303
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,300
What Brings You By?

304
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,300
Oh, Yeah, I Was Just Doing
A P.T.A. Thing This Morning.

305
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,200
I'm Really Big On Volunteering.
Anything For The Kids.

306
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,400
Anyway, I Got
Turned Around In Here.

307
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,100
This Place Is Like A Maze.

308
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,200
Didn't You Go Here?

309
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,500
You're So Funny.

310
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,600
So What's Up, Tony?
What's Shakin'? What's New?

311
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,600
Just P.E.

312
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,300
Fun. Fun.
I Love Sports, You Know?

313
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,800
Too Bad There's Not
A Big Game On Tonight,

314
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,800
'Cause I Got Nothing To Do.
Nothing. Nothing At All.

315
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,500
We're Short A Chaperone
For The School Dance. I...

316
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,900
Yeah, I Could Do That, Totally.
Anything For The Kids, You Know?

317
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,900
- Why Didn't You Tell Me There Was A Dance? 
- I'm Not Going.

318
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,000
It's Tacky, And Everyone Dresses
Like They're Going To A Hayride.

319
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,000
Of Course
He's Going To The Dance.

320
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,300
He's Always Dancing.

321
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,600
We Got Kicked Out
Of Church Once

322
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,200
- 'Cause He Was Doing The Funky Chicken. 
- Never In My Life Have I Done 
The Funky Chicken.

323
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,400
- Zip It. 
- So I'll See You Both Tonight Then?

324
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,200
Yeah. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. See
You Tonight. No. No. Mnh-Mnh.

325
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,000
God Bless You.

326
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,800
<I>Oh, No. God Bless You, Coach.
God Bless You.</I>

327
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,200
I'll Get Right On It,
Ms. Slater.

328
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,700
All Right. Let's Talk Cover...
What's Going On?

329
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
Wilhelmina Just Pitched
A Great Concept.

330
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,700
- What? 
- Well, It's Just A Takeoff On Your Idea.

331
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,700
Instead Of Doing The War Issue,
We're Doing The Peace Issue.

332
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,500
That's Not A Takeoff On My Idea.
That's The Exact Opposite.

333
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,300
Daniel, Give Peace A Chance.

334
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,800
What About Not Making Decisions
Without Each Other?

335
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,100
What About Two Against One?

336
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,800
- You Left The Meeting.
- I-

337
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,800
I've Got 20 Other Magazines
To Supervise, Including Mom's,

338
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,800
Which Is Going To Tank Unless
She Gets Some Advertisers.

339
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,300
Look, It's Starting Again.
Wilhelmina Is Taking Over.

340
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,200
It Was Just One Idea.

341
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,900
Stop Being Paranoid.

342
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,400
<I>Oh, Great Bracelet.
J'adore.</I>

343
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,200
Oh, Thank You.

344
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,400
<I>The Big Story Of The Day</I>

345
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,300
<I>Was Wilhelmina Slater's
Triumphant Return</I>

346
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,700
<I>To "Mode" Magazine,</I>

347
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,500
<I>Where She Greeted
Her Former Rival Daniel Meade</I>

348
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,600
<I>With A Hug.</I>

349
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,700
<I>Hmm. Uncomfortable.
Threatened Much, Daniel?</I>

350
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,300
She Leaked That Photo!

351
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,000
<I>Looks Like Someone Is Afraid
The Diva Will Return "Mode"</I>

352
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,600
<I>- To Its Former Glory. 
- What? "Former Glory"? 
Can You Believe This?</I>

353
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,900
Now If "Mode" Does Well,
They're Gonna Think

354
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,400
- It's 'Cause Of Wilhelmina?
- Oh, My God.

355
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
What Do You Mean,
"Oh, My God"?

356
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,500
This Is The Part
Where You Usually Tell Me,

357
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,000
- "Daniel, You're Being Crazy." 
- I Know, I Know, But-But That 
Kind Of Makes Sense.

358
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,600
I Mean, I-I Can Totally See
Why You're Worried.

359
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,800
- Is There Something I Should Do? 
- You Know What?

360
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,800
Go Home. I Want You
To Work On That Article.

361
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,800
I'm Gonna Handle This.
If She Wants To Spin The Press,

362
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,500
Then We Are Gonna
Spin The Press.

363
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,100
<I>...The Official Announcement,</I>

364
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
<I>But I'll Be Happy
To Answer Any Questions.</I>

365
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,000
Just Give Me
One Minute, All Right?

366
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,600
Marc,
What Are You Doing Here?

367
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,500
Just Wanted To See You
In Your Element.

368
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,100
- Ooh, Pastries.
- Crafty Is For Talent Only.

369
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,200
That's Short
For "Craft Services,"

370
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,800
Which Is Long For "Food."
I'm Sorry. It's Industry Lingo.

371
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,900
- Now, Uh, Just Get Out Of Here.
- Why? Why Can't I Be On The Show?

372
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,500
<I>It's Not Me.
I Want You On The Show.</I>

373
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Oh, Yeah.

374
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,800
It's, Um-It's Gene.
He Hates The Gays.

375
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,500
- No.
- Yes. Okay. Now, Um, Please.

376
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,100
It Would Be So Much Easier
For Me If You Just Left.

377
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,300
Hey, You And I Come
As A Package...

378
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
So He Is Just Gonna Have
To Get Used To It.

379
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,600
- Gene Simmons?
- Yeah.

380
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,700
I'm Marc St. James,

381
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,200
Amanda's Best Friend
In The Whole Wide World.

382
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm Here, I'm Queer
And I'm Eating Your Pastries.

383
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,300
You're Funny.

384
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,000
You Know, We Could Use
A Funny Gay Guy

385
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,600
- In Our Next Segment. Uh,
Wanna Be On The Show? 
- Yes.

386
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,300
- This Is Fabulous.
- Thank You.

387
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,000
What I Was Thinking-

388
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,700
What? Tell Me.
Please, I'd Love To Hear It.

389
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,200
How You Doing Over There?

390
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,400
I Can't Concentrate.

391
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,300
Why? Is It Henry Again?

392
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,300
I Keep Trying
To Focus On My Work,

393
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,500
And Then Gio Went
And Kissed Me.

394
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,600
<I>What?
Gio Kissed You?</I>

395
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,400
Girl, Spill It!
Can He Kiss?

396
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,200
Don't Get Excited.
It Was Awful...

397
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,000
- Ooh.
- And I Feel Guilty.

398
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,700
Guilty? Why?

399
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,500
Because You Liked It.

400
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,100
No, I Just Miss Henry.
That's All.

401
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,800
And-And I'm Not Even Close

402
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,500
To Being Ready
To Think About Another Guy.

403
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,800
It's Not Time Yet.

404
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,500
Is It?
Oh, God, I'm Terrible.

405
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,200
<I>Ay, Please. You Think
You Can't Have Feelings</I>

406
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,700
For More Than One Guy
At A Time?

407
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,800
I Know You Lost Henry,
But You Cannot Plan

408
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,200
When You're Gonna Start
Feeling Things Again.

409
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Big Man On Campus
Coming Through.

410
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,300
It's An Homage To "Grease."

411
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,400
Danny Zuko Meets Couture.

412
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,600
If I'm Going
To This Tacky Thing,

413
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,800
<I>- I'll At Least Make A Splash.
- Papi, Will You Get Out Of Here</I>

414
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,600
Before You Get
The Rest Of Us Sick?

415
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,100
- You're Already Sick. 
- I Am Not. You Are Crazy. I'm Fine.

416
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,300
But Is It, Like,
1,000 Degrees In Here Or What?

417
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,300
Ow.

418
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,600
Hilda, You're Burning Up.

419
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,400
- There Is No Way You're Going To That Dance. 
- No, Tonight Is The Night

420
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,800
That I Find Out
If The Coach Likes Me.

421
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,300
<I>So Help Me God,
I Am Going To That Dance.</I>

422
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,200
- You Want All Those Kids To Get Your Cold? 
- To Hell With The Kids.

423
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,600
- Hilda!
- What?

424
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,800
Besides, If I Don't Go,

425
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,700
Then They're Gonna Be Short
A Chaperone. Please. Mm.

426
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,500
I'll Go.

427
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,300
What?

428
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,000
I'll Go. I'll Be Surrounded
By Kids All Night.

429
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,300
I Can Interview Them. I'll Get
Their Youth Perspective.

430
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,900
I'll Build My Article Around
Their Quotes. It's Perfect.

431
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,100
I Can't Concentrate
Around Here Anyway.

432
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,600
<I>- Do I Still Have To Go? 
- Yes.
Because You Gotta Spy On The Coach.</I>

433
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,400
- Hilda.
- I'm Gonna Go Get Ready.

434
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,700
I Think I Still Have
My Homecoming Dress.

435
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,300
No Velour Or Lace
Or Paisley.

436
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Better Go Up There.

437
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,600
Here.

438
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,200
<I>Oh, Thanks, Papi.</I>

439
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,400
You Know,

440
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,300
From The First Moment
I Looked Into Your Eyes,

441
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,500
It Was Like Some Kind
Of Cosmic Connection.

442
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,700
I- I Don't Know What It Is,
But, You Know,

443
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,500
I Knew You Were My Daughter.
Happiest Day Of My Life.

444
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,300
Gene, Do You Mean That?
I Really Do.

445
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,200
Stand By.
We Have Sound Problems.

446
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,800
Oh. Reset, Everybody. Back In Ten.

447
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
No, It's-It's Okay.

448
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,500
Um, Hey, Tell Me
About My Mom.

449
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,400
Can I Have A Water? Asap.
Hello? Yes, Mr. Simmons.

450
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,100
Hey, Uh, Did, Uh, Did She Ever Contact
You? I'm So Sorry. I've Got To Get This.

451
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,500
Hello. Brian.

452
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,800
That Was Weird.

453
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,600
<I>Oh, No.
That's Classic Gene.</I>

454
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,400
He's Always On His Phone.
It's Kind Of A Celebrity Thing.

455
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,200
You Wouldn't Really Understand It. H
- He Was So Sweet When The Cameras Were On,

456
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,100
And Then He Did, Like,
A Complete 180.

457
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,400
What Do You Mean? 180? It
Means, Like, Complete Opposite.

458
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,500
No, I Know What 180 Means.
Are You Trying To Say

459
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,100
That What My Father
And I Have Isn't Real?

460
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,900
This Is Exactly Why
I Didn't Want You To Come Here.

461
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,600
You-You Are So Jealous
That I'm Rock Royalty.

462
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,300
Well, What Are You?

463
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,000
Oh, My God. Look At This Place,
All The Decorations.

464
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,900
Yeah, It's Still The Gym.

465
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
It's Like Putting Lipstick
On A Pig.

466
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,900
Okay, So I Guess
I Should Start Getting Quotes.

467
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,600
Are You Ready To Have Fun?

468
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,500
Yeah, But We're Here.
I'm Gonna Go Find The Coach.

469
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Okay.

470
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,400
Hi, Uh, Could-

471
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,200
Excuse Me, Do You Have
A Second? I Just-

472
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,800
* I Could Make You Excited *

473
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,400
Excuse Me. Hi.

474
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,600
I'm Writing An Article
For A Magazine

475
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,200
On The Youth Perspective.

476
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,700
As A Young Woman,

477
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,100
What Do You Think
About The Older Generations?

478
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,700
You Know, Like, What Would You Say
To Somebody Who Was 60?

479
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,100
Like You?

480
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Um, Okay.

481
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,300
Let's Try This
A Different Way.

482
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,600
I Know You From Somewhere.
Nope. I Don't Think So.

483
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,900
Yeah, Braces.
You Know My Brother.

484
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,400
Who's Your Brother?

485
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,500
I Knew You Were Stalking Me.

486
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,000
<I>You Are Stalking Me. What Are
You Doing Here? I'm A Chaperone.</I>

487
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,300
Well, Me, Too,
But I'm Also Working,

488
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,100
So If You Don't Mind...

489
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,100
Oh, I See. You Get Your Kiss,
And Now You're Blowing Me Off.

490
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,600
<I>You Kissed Me. Yeah,
Well, You Kissed Me Back.</I>

491
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,100
I Even Felt Your Tongue.
I Was Blocking Your Tongue.

492
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,800
You Frenched Me, Suarez.
You Frenched Me Good.

493
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,600
I Did Not French You.

494
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,200
Gio, I Have An Article
That I Need To Write,

495
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,600
And My Deadline Is Tomorrow,
So Please Stop Distracting Me.

496
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,000
What? I'm Chaperoning Here.

497
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,150
And Who Calls It "Frenching"?

498
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Hello?

499
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,500
Is He There? The Coach?
Yeah.

500
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,000
He's Talking To Miss Kazlauskas,
The Social Studies Teacher. "Miss"?

501
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Is She Young? Is She Pretty?
Is She Prettier Than Me?

502
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,500
Uh, No Competish.
She Has A Lazy Eye.

503
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,000
Ooh. Tough Break For Her,
But Yay For Us.

504
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,800
So Are You Saying That
The Return Of Wilhelmina Slater

505
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,700
Is Not Going To Affect
Things At "Mode" At All?

506
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,000
Well, No, It's Irrelevant.

507
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,500
As Far As The Magazine
Is Concerned,

508
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,500
Wilhelmina Is Back In Name Only. Let's
Take Some Calls. Uh, Burlington, Vermont,

509
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,800
You're On The Air
With Daniel Meade.

510
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,300
Hi.
Uh, I Wanna Know,

511
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,800
Why Don't You Give
Wilhelmina Slater Some Credit?

512
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,200
Isn't That A Little Sexist?
Oh, No. Not At All.

513
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,500
I'm-I'm Just Here Trying
To Set The Record Straight.

514
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,900
Well, What About The Photo Where
You Were Shoving Her? Wait A Minute.

515
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,450
Do We-Do We Have
That Photo In The System?

516
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,200
Uh, It's Actually Not Me, Uh
- Wait A Minute. Wait A Minute, Daniel.

517
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,300
There It I-Whoa. You Are
Really Shoving Her There.

518
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,100
Uh, Do You Have Problems
With Successfu Women,

519
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,400
Or Just Women Who Don't Want
To Sleep With You?

520
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,300
Oh, I Know What This Is.
It's Wilhelmina's Assistant

521
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,300
Putting On A Female Voice.
I'm Sorry.

522
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,200
It Sounds Like A Girl.
Thank You, Larry.

523
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,400
You're Welcome.
Uh, Isn't It Also True,

524
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,500
Wilhelmina Put In
20 Years Of Hard Work

525
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,700
While You Got Your Job Through
Nepotism? Fair Question.

526
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,700
No.
It Wasn't Nepotism.

527
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,149
My Father Gave Me The Job.
That's Not What I Meant To Say.

528
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,500
I, Um, I Deserved It.

529
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,400
And This Call Is A Fake.
It's Marc From My Office.

530
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,400
And Wilhelmina Is
A Backstabbing, Conniving,

531
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,800
Vicious Little-
Now, Daniel, Wait A Minute.

532
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:05,000
<I>My Producer Says That This Call
Is Coming From Vermont.</I>

533
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,900
Beautiful Foliage,
Uh, Up There.

534
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:12,900
Question-

535
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,400
What Kind Of Colorful Phrases
Are Kids Using These Days?

536
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,100
Is It Still "Bling-Bling"
Or Is It Just One "Bling" Or...

537
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Whoa.

538
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,800
He'll Be Back.

539
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,900
I Need Your Help. Oh, I
Thought I Was Distracting You.

540
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,600
I Don't Have A Single Quote
For My Article,

541
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,000
Not One Without Profanity,
Anyway.

542
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,900
I Literally Have
Kids Running From Me,

543
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,700
And You Are Surrounded By Them.
How Do You Do It?

544
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,200
I Just Talk To Them
Like A Normal Person.

545
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,700
They're Pretty Much The Same
As Everybody You Know.

546
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,900
I Mean, Look.
There's A Daniel.

547
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,200
And, Uh, There's An Amanda.

548
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,200
Oh, That Kid
Is Definitely Me.

549
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,900
Ugh! I Hate That Little Kid!

550
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,900
I Busted Him Twice Tonight
For Defacing Posters.

551
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Yeah.

552
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,000
And Now We Know Who You Were
In Junior High School-

553
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,900
The Girl Who Never
Had Any Fun.

554
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,850
Um, I Had Plenty Of Fun.

555
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:16,400
Yeah.

556
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,000
I Did Yearbook And, Uh,
Young Environmentalists

557
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And-And Multicultural Club,

558
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,300
<I>And, You Know,
I Don't Like To Brag,</I>

559
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,300
But In Eighth Grade, I Did Win
The Good Citizen Award.

560
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,700
Of Course You Have A Good Citizen
Award. Well, I Don't Technically Have It.

561
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,000
I Gave It Back So That Everyone
At The School Could Enjoy It,

562
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,800
Which Kind Of Sucks,

563
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,300
Because I Worked Really Hard
For That Award,

564
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,900
And Now I Can Barely See It
Through The Trophy Case,

565
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,900
But That's Okay,

566
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,900
Because Giving Back
Is What A Good Citizen Does.

567
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,600
Oh, Found Her-
Little Betty.

568
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,300
She Must Be Covering This Thing
For The School Paper.

569
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
No.

570
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,500
She's Waiting For Someone
To Ask Her To Dance.

571
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,600
Okay, I'll Try Again...

572
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,800
Your Way.

573
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,300
I'll Talk To Her
Like A Normal Person.

574
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,300
I Have Heard

575
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,700
That Your Advertising Problems
Haven't Gotten Any Better.

576
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,700
May I Suggest
- I'm Really Not Interested In Your Opinion.

577
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,900
You Would Sabotage Me
In A Heartbeat.

578
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,100
Ancient History, Claire.

579
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,000
Why Don't You Just Say
What You're Going To Say And Go?

580
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,600
Have You Ever Considered Giving
Away Your Advertising For Free?

581
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,800
<I>Why Would I Possibly Do That?</I>

582
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,900
Because Advertisers
Are Like Sheep-

583
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,900
You Give Free Space
To One "It" Brand

584
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,200
In Exchange For A Promise

585
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,000
That They Don't Tell
Anyone Else It's Free,

586
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,500
And All Of The Sudden,
You've Landed A Big Account,

587
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,200
You're Legit
And All The Other Buyers

588
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,700
Are Willing To Pay Top Dollar To Be In
Your Magazine. 

589
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,700
Why Are You Helping Me?

590
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,600
Because I Have A Real Stake
In This Company Now. Ah.

591
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,900
Your Failure Is
One-Third My Failure.

592
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Ah.

593
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,800
Good Luck, Claire.

594
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,900
Hey, Gene.
Yeah.

595
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,900
I'm Really Upset.

596
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,800
I Just Had
This Huge Fight With Marc,

597
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
And I Feel Terrible.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

598
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,700
Are You About To-
Are You About To Start Crying?

599
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
That's Great.
Just Hold That Thought.

600
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,100
Hey, Pal, Do Me A Favor. Would You Come Over
- No, No, No. Please, Please No Cameras.

601
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,800
Come On. I- I Really Just
Need A Father-Daughter Moment,

602
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
One-On-One.

603
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,100
Okay. Okay. Calm Down.
Yeah.

604
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,400
Excuse Me? Can You Get
That Camera Over Here Right Now?

605
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,000
Hurry Up. Be Right There, Mr. Simmons.

606
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,200
Gene, What Happened
To Your Tattoo?

607
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,400
It Looks Fake.

608
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,100
Gene,
Are You My Father Or Not?

609
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,900
Um...

610
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,100
What Are You
Looking Forward To Most?

611
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,900
Graduation.
This One Goes Out
To Betty From Gio.

612
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,700
All Right, Kids,

613
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,200
Grab That Special Someone
And Hit The Dance Floor.

614
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,800
So What Do You Say, B.?

615
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,900
Do You Wanna
Do Something Crazy

616
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,200
And Actually Dance
At A School Dance?

617
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,600
Aw, Don't Worry About Her.
I've Got That Covered.

618
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,100
Do You Wanna Dance?

619
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,200
I Don't Know.

620
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,400
Go. Have Fun.

621
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,600
Well, That Was Very Nice.

622
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,100
Come On.
Take A Break From Your Article.

623
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,200
<I>* Always In Time *</I>

<I>* Huh, Huh, Huh, Hu-Uh, Huh</I>

634
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:23,500
<I>* I Know This Much Is True *</I>

635
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Hey.

636
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Oh, I'm Fine. How Are You?

637
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,700
I'm Good.

638
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,800
You Realize I Didn't
Actually Ask, "How Are You?"

639
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,000
Oh, I'm Fine.
Thanks.

640
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,200
You're Really Good
At Hiding It.

641
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Yeah.

642
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,600
It's Just,
I'm Not The Type Of Person

643
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,150
Who Can Have A Boyfriend
And Forget About Them...

644
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,200
Especially Someone I Love.

645
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Loved.

646
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,750
What Am I Doing
Dancing With You, Gio?

647
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,000
What Does That Say
About Me?

648
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,850
God, Betty,
It Must Be So Exhausting...

649
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,800
Always Worrying
About The Right Thing To Do.

650
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,200
What Do You Mean?

651
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,400
Didn't You Give Back
Your Good Citizen Award

652
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,150
Because That's
What A Good Citizen Does?

653
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,200
And Maybe
You Should Stop Worrying

654
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,600
About How
You're Supposed To Be,

655
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,100
And Just... Be.

656
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,900
I'm Really Sad.

657
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,700
Well, Sad I Think
We Can Work With.

658
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,500
Talk To Me. I Don't Know What Happened.

659
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,900
Coach Was Standing
By The Bleachers,

660
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,000
And Then He Disappeared.

661
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
<I>I May Have Left My Post Briefly To
Dance. You Know What, Sweetie? I Am Sorry.</I>

662
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,100
I've Been Bugging You All Night.
Go Have Fun.

663
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,000
Mom, You Aren't Bugging Me.

664
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,200
I'm Really Glad You Found
Someone You Like Again.

665
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,500
Oh, Thank You, Sweetie,

666
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,100
But Obviously,
This Wasn't Meant To Be,

667
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,900
So I'll Just See You
When You Get Home, Okay?

668
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,700
Bye.

669
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,500
Okay. Bye.

670
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,400
<I>* I'm High-Class *</I>

671
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,600
<I>* I Ain't No Trailer Trash *</I>

672
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,400
<I>* I'm High-Class,
I Ain't No Trailer Trash *</I>

673
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,800
Oh, Hey, Justin.

674
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,700
Hey, Um, My Mom Would
Kill Me For Doing This,

675
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,150
But She Wants To Know
If You Like Her.

676
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,900
If I Like Her?
Yeah.

677
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,300
What Is This, Junior High?

678
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,259
Actually, Yes,
And She Totally Likes You.

679
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,060
Actually, Yes,
And She Totally Likes You.

680
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,500
Over My Dead Body.

681
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
Mom, I'm Sorry. It's Done.

682
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,100
Uh, What's Going On Here?

683
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,200
Go Ahead.
Tell Your Brother.

684
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,100
I Reinstated Wilhelmina
As Creative Director Of "Mode."

685
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,900
What? Do You Know How Much Easier
It Was Having Her Around Today?

686
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,800
I Mean,
She Saved Your Cover.

687
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,200
She Helped Save "Hot Flash"
In Under A Minute.

688
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:15,900
She's The Best In The Business. And She's
A Ruthless, Immoral, Ambitious Snake.

689
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:20,000
That's What Makes Her So Good. What Happened
To Not Making Any Moves Without Each Other?

690
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,600
Like You Going
On National Television

691
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Making An Ass Out Of Yourself
And This Magazine?

692
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,000
This Is Damage Control.
You're Making A Huge Mistake.

693
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,500
No, I'm Making
A Tough Decision,

694
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,800
Which Is My Job
As President Of This Company.

695
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,600
This Discussion's Over.

696
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,100
I Can't Steal
My Good Citizen Trophy.

697
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,400
Oh, Come On.
You Know You Want To.

698
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,400
It'll Make You Feel Better,
I Promise.

699
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Okay. Yep. There It Is.
I Can See It Kind Of.

700
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,500
All Right. Maybe I Could
Just Hold It For A Second,

701
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
And Then Put It Back.

702
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,500
Or You Could Take A Picture
Of Me With Your Cell Phone.

703
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
No, No.
That Could Be Evidence.

704
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,800
"Betty, Come Get Me.

705
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,500
You Worked So Hard.
I Belong To You."

706
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Shh. My Trophy Speaks
With A Mexican Accent?

707
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,000
All Trophies Do.

708
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Okay.

709
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Oh, My God.

710
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,700
Oh, My God. Oh, My God.
Oh, My God. I Got It.

711
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,400
I Got It. It's A Lot Lighter
Than I Imagined.

712
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,800
Stop Right There.

713
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,200
Principal Hayward.

714
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,700
Betty Suarez?

715
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,300
Stealing?

716
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,000
You're A Bad Citizen,
Betty Suarez.

717
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,400
Wilhelmina.

718
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,800
Alexis May Be Onboard With You
And Your Little Act,

719
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,500
But I Am Not. I Haven't
Forgotten Who You Are.

720
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,400
Really, Daniel? Who Am I?

721
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,000
This Morning,
I Was Nothing At All,

722
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,900
This Evening,
I'm Creative Director,

723
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,000
And Tomorrow, Who Knows?

724
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,250
Maybe
I'll Be Editor-In-Chief.

725
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,100
Oh, Wait, That's Your Job,

726
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,400
Isn't It?

727
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,800
Sweet Dreams.

728
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,900
Well, If It Isn't
Miss Fancy-Pants Celebrity

729
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,200
Back Among The Muggles.

730
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,300
Stop. Hey, If You're
Really Such A Celebrity,

731
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,400
Then Where's Your Posse, Huh?
Where's Your Hybrid?

732
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,800
Where's Your
Inappropriately Named Baby?

733
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm Sorry.

734
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,500
I Was Mean.

735
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,400
Look, If You Think
That You And Gene

736
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,000
Have Such
A Great Relationship, Fine.

737
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,500
It's None Of My Business. Marc, You Were Right. I Didn't Want You Around,

738
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,800
'Cause I Didn't Want
You To See

739
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,200
That He Only Loved Me
On Camera.

740
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,900
It Wasn't Real.
He's Not Even My Father.

741
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,100
What Do You Mean?

742
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,500
It Was All A Publicity Stunt.

743
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,500
He Needed A Gimmick
For His Reality Show,

744
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,000
And I Was Just
A Gorgeous Ingenue

745
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,700
Looking For A Dad.

746
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,600
Well, I Didn't Want
To Say This Before,

747
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,100
<I>But I Am So Relieved.</I>

748
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,900
I Mean, Thank God
You're Not Related.

749
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,700
In Ten Years,

750
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,300
That Massive Forehead
Could Be You.

751
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,600
You're Right.

752
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
But I'm Sorry
You Still Don't Know

753
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,300
Who Your Family Is.

754
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,400
Yes, I Do.

755
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,000
Who Is It?

756
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,600
It's, Um, Tony Diaz.

757
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,300
Oh. Oh, God.

758
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,600
Just A Second, Okay?
I'll Be Right There.

759
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,400
Okay.

760
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,900
Oh, My God. Oh, God.

761
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,900
Tony. Hi. How Are You?

762
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,100
I'm Good.
Oh.

763
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,500
Missed You At The Dance.
Heard You Had A Nasty Cold.

764
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,400
Yeah, You Know, I Just Have
A Little Bit Of An...

765
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Ah.

766
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,300
Tickle In My Throat.

767
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,200
That Doesn't Sound Too Good. No.

768
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,400
Here. I Brought You Some Soup. What?

769
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,000
That Is So Nice.

770
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I Am So Embarrassed.
I Look Horrible.

771
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,100
Oh, No, No, No,
What Are You-No.

772
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,900
You-You Look Great.

773
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,350
Do You Wanna, Um, Come In?

774
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,500
Uh, I-I Think
I Should Get Going,

775
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,400
But, You, Um,
You Feel Better Soon, Okay?

776
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,300
Thanks For The Soup.

777
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,900
Um, Whenever
You're Up To It,

778
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,600
I Don't Know, Maybe We Could
Hang Out Sometime?

779
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Yeah, I Would Like That.
Really?

780
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,100
Yeah.

781
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,500
Okay. Good.

782
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,459
All Right. Enjoy The Soup.
Okay. Thank You.

783
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,360
All Right. Enjoy The Soup.
Okay. Thank You.

784
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,600
* He Likes Me *

785
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,700
* He Really Li...*

786
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,700
It's Only A Matter Of Time

787
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,250
Before I Break
This Family Apart For Good.

788
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,300
Wow. I Love This.

789
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,850
You're Back
And Wilhelmeaner Than Ever.

790
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,000
Well, I Couldn't Have Done It
Without Your Help.

791
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,200
I Especially Liked The Caller
On Larry King From Vermont

792
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,400
Putting Daniel
Through The Ringer.

793
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,300
Well, He Is A Sexist Pig.

794
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,500
Brilliant Move Getting
A Vermont Cell Phone.

795
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,500
You Told Me To.

796
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,500
Like I Said, Brilliant Move.

797
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,600
So The Principal
Turns To Her And Says...

798
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,150
"Betty Suarez, You're Expelled."

799
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,300
No Way.
Badass.

800
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,200
No, It Is Not Badass
To Get Expelled From School,

801
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,700
So Don't Go Gettin'
Any Ideas.

802
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,600
Too Late. You're Officially
A Bad Influence.

803
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,600
Okay, It's Time For Us
To Go Inside.

804
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,900
Your Mom's
Probably Waiting.

805
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,800
All Right. Bye.
Bye.

806
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,600
Wait Right Here.
I'm Gonna Go Say

807
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,700
A Proper Good Night
To Betty, Okay?

808
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,800
I'm Sorry
I Got You Into Trouble.

809
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,100
Don't Worry
About It. I Had Fun.

810
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,100
And Besides, I Figured Out

811
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,900
What My Article's
Gonna Be About-

812
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,200
"You Can Be Young
At Any Age."

813
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,500
I Mean, I Just Had
My First Junior High Dance,

814
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,200
And I'm 24.
I'm Glad I Could Help.

815
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,300
Well, I Better Get Inside And Start
Writing. Right, Right. The Deadline.

816
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,700
Yeah.
Good Luck.

817
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
Thanks.

818
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,000
Hey, Uh, Crazy Idea.

819
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,200
Um, Do You Wanna,
Uh, Maybe,

820
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,300
Uh, Do Something
Some-Sometime?

821
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,900
What, Like-Like A Date?

822
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,300
I Don't Know. Yeah.

823
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,700
Betty, Um,
I Don't Think So.

824
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,700
What?

825
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,300
I Just-I Don't Think
It's A Good Idea.

826
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Um... Okay.
I'm A Little Confused.

827
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,000
Um... Okay.
I'm A Little Confused.

828
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,000
See, You Kissed Me,

829
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,400
And Then
You Danced With Me,

830
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,500
And You Talked About
Being My Rebound Guy,

831
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,200
So I Mean,
What Was That All About?

832
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,650
