1
00:00:00,695 --> 00:00:02,094
Previously on "Ugly Betty"...

2
00:00:02,124 --> 00:00:03,411
How bad is it between them?

3
00:00:03,441 --> 00:00:04,867
It's like Cain and Abel.

4
00:00:05,022 --> 00:00:06,141
Cut it out!

5
00:00:06,171 --> 00:00:07,715
It's time for us
to get practical.

6
00:00:07,745 --> 00:00:08,871
I will handle this.

7
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:10,267
Hey, whether you
like it or not,

8
00:00:10,297 --> 00:00:11,971
he asked me to pick him
up from school today.

9
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:14,377
Last night,
a friend from home showed up...

10
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:16,750
My ex-girlfriend.

11
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:18,309
Wow.

12
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:19,575
Where do we stand?

13
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:23,401
Maybe it wouldn't kill us
to try and work together.

14
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:25,240
You do believe I'm innocent,
don't you?

15
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:26,422
I want to.

16
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:28,742
I know who killed Fey Sommers.

17
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:31,562
It was me.

18
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:39,853
Betty.

19
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:43,542
Betty, you're snoring.

20
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:48,683
Mrs. Meade?

21
00:00:48,857 --> 00:00:51,322
I killed her, Betty.
I killed Fey Sommers,

22
00:00:51,357 --> 00:00:53,331
and I'll kill you, too,

23
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:56,361
if you tell anyone,
especially Daniel.

24
00:00:57,717 --> 00:01:00,371
Now... where do you
keep the Vermouth?

25
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:10,770
Hey, Betty.

26
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:15,992
Henry.

27
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:17,183
Cute headgear.

28
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:19,523
You met my girlfriend?

29
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:30,900
It's nice to meet you.

30
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:34,400
It's too bad it didn't
work out between us.

31
00:01:36,258 --> 00:01:37,990
Claire Meade's gonna
kill you, anyway.

32
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,853
It's gonna be a long night.

33
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,371
Alexis, please.

34
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:03,823
You're my brother, Danny.
I'll call you whatever I want.

35
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:04,800
Fine.

36
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:07,452
Well, will you be at the
ad sales meeting at 10:00?

37
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:10,320
That might be awkward if we're
both sitting at the same table.

38
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:12,532
Daniel, we're both in charge.

39
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:15,561
It's only gonna be awkward if you
still shove grapes up your nose.

40
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:18,163
I did manage to get three up there once,
though, didn't I?

41
00:02:19,495 --> 00:02:21,201
Hold on.
Your collar's going crazy.

42
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:23,061
Thank you.

43
00:02:29,857 --> 00:02:30,790
Good morning, Betty.

44
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,283
Good morning.

45
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:35,850
Oh, right. Stella McCartney's
having that party tonight.

46
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:38,100
You know, I got plans with Becks.
You want my invite?

47
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:40,601
Um, yeah, sure, maybe.

48
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:41,981
Maybe?

49
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:44,392
Betty, last week I gave you
a calendar from my bank,

50
00:02:44,408 --> 00:02:46,732
and you were all like, "shut up.
I can have this?"

51
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,310
This is Stella McCartney.

52
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:50,083
Daniel, I need to talk to you.

53
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:50,941
Okay.

54
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:54,273
Let me, um,
call Chloe from Prada first, okay?

55
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,723
Your mother killed Fey Sommers!

56
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:03,150
You don't need to
sign for this.

57
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:11,262
They were being so
nice to each other.

58
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:13,963
Maybe daddy told Daniel and
Alexis if they didn't play nice,

59
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,832
he'd take away their
private planes.

60
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:17,781
Oh, but they were smiling.

61
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,332
Stop fondling my limes
and do something!

62
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,591
And breathe in happy air.

63
00:03:24,898 --> 00:03:27,461
Let me put out a gay-p.b.
among the assistants,

64
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,063
and I'll find out
what's going on.

65
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:35,051
You rang?

66
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:38,523
Do you want something hemmed?

67
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:41,152
You're not here to stitch.
You're here to snitch.

68
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,931
She needs information, bitch.

69
00:03:43,728 --> 00:03:45,241
I thought we were rhyming.

70
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:49,260
What exactly do
you want from me?

71
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,823
Has  your friend Betty
told you exactly

72
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:54,771
what's going on between
Daniel and Alexis?

73
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:56,500
- How do you mean?
- Don't be a cluck.

74
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:59,793
The cold front between the
Meade boys has clearly thawed.

75
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:01,462
Who turned up the heat?

76
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:03,510
Okay. Here's the skinny.

77
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:06,630
Word is,
Alexis' calendar is empty.

78
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:07,963
Nobody's returning her calls.

79
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,462
No lunches, no nothing.

80
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:12,713
It looks like she's
reaching out to her brother

81
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:15,440
because she's friendless.

82
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,101
Really?

83
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:20,991
This might mean an in for me.

84
00:04:22,736 --> 00:04:23,783
What are we thinking?

85
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:26,622
Okay, so I'm not
part of the "we,"

86
00:04:26,656 --> 00:04:28,821
so unless you need
my sewing skills,

87
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,440
then I'm just going to leave.

88
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:33,153
Looks like that one's
gonna be trouble.

89
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:36,320
I want you to make sure that pasty
seamstress stays on our side.

90
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:38,701
Become her best friend.
Be her new Betty.

91
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,381
Oh, no. I guess
I have to start eating potatoes.

92
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:47,270
Betty, my mother tends to be a
bit delusional when she drinks.

93
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:48,771
She said she cut her brakes.

94
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:50,891
Yeah, and after a few cocktails,
she's also claimed

95
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:52,651
she's won the Boston marathon

96
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:54,232
and caused the tsunami.

97
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:57,983
She followed her in her Aston Martin
and watched her crash into a tree.

98
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:04,631
Call Rikers.
Tell them need to see my father.

99
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:12,423
Your mother did not kill Fey.

100
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,461
What are you listening
to that assistant for?

101
00:05:14,495 --> 00:05:16,660
Why would mother confess
to something like that?

102
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:19,490
Here's a surprise, Daniel.
She's a drunk.

103
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:22,421
She may have her demons,
but she's not a murderer.

104
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,951
Why don't you try focusing on
something a little more important,

105
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:26,893
like  finding me a new lawyer?

106
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:28,583
I need someone better.

107
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:30,663
- I need "The Chin."
- The who?

108
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,601
The Chin. You wanna help me,

109
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,741
get me Grace Chin.

110
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,493
Grace Chin?

111
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:40,240
You dated that?

112
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:42,841
No, actually, I stood that up.

113
00:05:42,878 --> 00:05:43,692
Good call.

114
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:45,883
Not enough beer in the world
to make that look good.

115
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:47,633
She was my T.A. sophomore year.

116
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,930
I promised her if she
helped me pass criminology,

117
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:52,712
that I'd take her to the
Sigma Phi New Year's kegger.

118
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:54,523
That's so man-whore of you.

119
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,341
Yeah, except that was the night
Cindy Howard showed up at my room

120
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:01,370
and decided being a virgin
wasn't cool anymore.

121
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:05,261
That's interesting, because she
decided that two weeks earlier

122
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:06,533
in my room.

123
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:11,771
Becks, Grace Chin will
never take my father's case,

124
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,450
not after what I did to her.

125
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:15,370
That was last century.

126
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:17,102
Look at this fatty.

127
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:19,381
She's probably got three,
four chins by now.

128
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:20,732
Give her a call.

129
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,851
She'll be happy to 
hear from a man.

130
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:30,992
- What are you doing tonight?
- I've absolutely no idea,

131
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:32,881
but it involves a
buttload of alcohol.

132
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:36,101
Perfect. Daniel ge me his invitation
to the Stella McCartney party,

133
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,043
and you are gonna
be my plus one.

134
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:40,661
- It says "V.I.P."
- I know.

135
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:42,263
I've never even been
an I.P. before.

136
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:43,923
And look at the lettering.
It's so rich.

137
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:46,731
Oh, honey. You're feeling up a piece
of paper. You need to get out more.

138
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:48,593
I do. I really do.
I need to do something

139
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,382
to  get my mind off of Henry
and his slutty girlfriend.

140
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,411
You met her?

141
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:54,762
No, but you know she is.

142
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:58,912
Hello. Christina McKinney.

143
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:02,280
Yes, very good.
Who is this, really?

144
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:04,709
Really?

145
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:08,455
No--yes. Yeah. A-absolutely.

146
00:07:10,224 --> 00:07:12,381
I'm on hold for
Sarah Jessica Parker.

147
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,991
- What do I do?
- You're doing it.

148
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:14,741
I can't.

149
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:16,223
You talk to celebrities
all the time.

150
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:17,930
I know, but not ones I like.

151
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:23,403
Hello. This is
Christina McKinney.

152
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:25,292
I'm Scottish,
not an australian hooker.

153
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:27,942
You saw my work at
the fashion week?

154
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:30,672
Of course I can create
an Oscar dress.

155
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:32,821
When do you need it?

156
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:35,103
Tomorrow! Crikey!

157
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,093
She'll do it! I'll do it.

158
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:40,362
Good day, mate.

159
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:44,252
No, Betty! What the whale?
I can't whip up a dress in a night!

160
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:45,981
It's gotta be done by tomorrow!

161
00:07:47,186 --> 00:07:49,313
She's leaving for L.A.
You can do this!

162
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,062
You're one of the Top
Ten Designers to Watch.

163
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:54,281
No, no, but it's Sarah Jessica Parker!
It's the Oscars!

164
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:57,300
It's the chance of a lifetime.
Get psyched.

165
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:59,631
Oh, I can't. Yes, I can. I can.

166
00:07:59,668 --> 00:08:00,801
Silk sheath...

167
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:02,852
low back...

168
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,771
And don't worry about tonight.
I will find another plus one.

169
00:08:06,808 --> 00:08:08,240
Cut on the bias...

170
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:10,700
Good luck.

171
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:17,160
What? $14 for a
brownie and a sandwich?

172
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,661
They keep prices high
to discourage eating.

173
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:24,130
I'm--I'm sorry. I'm $2 short.

174
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:26,900
Uh, but what if I just
took part of the brownie?

175
00:08:26,937 --> 00:08:29,382
Oh, no, no. Don't worry about it.
I got it. Here.

176
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,703
Oh, that's so sweet.

177
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:33,231
I've been in this city for two days,
and the kindest thing anybody's said is,

178
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:35,452
"hey, your ass could make
a nice chunk of change."

179
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:38,211
Well, that is just New York's
way of saying, "welcome.

180
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:39,891
You look good in your jeans."

181
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:43,612
Charlotte, by the way.
Everybody calls me Charlie.

182
00:08:44,826 --> 00:08:46,840
You have an amazing aura.

183
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,530
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

184
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:54,482
You haven't even studied
at beauty school yet.

185
00:08:54,518 --> 00:08:57,202
Cosmetology institute, please.

186
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,401
And if I'm gonna get a leg up,
I have to practice, so...

187
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:02,581
Come on, papi. You said that
you would help me with this

188
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:04,012
if I gave you a beer.

189
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:05,582
Yeah, but you had two.

190
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:06,583
I was nervous.

191
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:07,970
Mom, emergency.

192
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:10,303
The weatherman said there's
gonna be a blizzard tonight.

193
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:12,733
Well, Justin, don't worry.

194
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:15,400
We will get you into the city
for "Hairspray," I promise.

195
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:18,621
Like you promised me the new Fergie CD,
which I still don't have?

196
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,601
Come on, mom.
Don't phunk with my heart.

197
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:24,831
Justin, your father's not even
gonna be here until 6:00.

198
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:26,002
It'll be okay.

199
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:28,083
Fine, but if I miss one
minute of the first act,

200
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:29,982
you think this is diva now?

201
00:09:31,477 --> 00:09:33,261
Santos is going to "Hairspray"?

202
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:35,143
He knows that's not
a strip club, right?

203
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:40,461
I-I might not have told him that he's
going with us to a musical just yet.

204
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:42,201
Honey, what are you doing?

205
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:45,722
If Santos wants to spend
more time with his son,

206
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:48,680
then Santos should do
stuff that his son likes.

207
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:50,672
It's a good idea, right?

208
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:55,253
It is... it is... isn't it?

209
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:57,421
Ay, I need another beer.

210
00:09:59,257 --> 00:10:01,101
So what kind of art do you do?

211
00:10:01,865 --> 00:10:03,290
Mostly jewelry.

212
00:10:03,508 --> 00:10:05,770
I love working with
found objects, but...

213
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:07,410
the only thing I've
found so far in New York

214
00:10:07,446 --> 00:10:09,421
are hypodermic
needles and condoms.

215
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:10,912
You could sell that here.

216
00:10:11,097 --> 00:10:12,820
No, really, it's New York.

217
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:18,142
Actually, I think this
city is a little scary.

218
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:20,152
Most people seem to
feel that way at first,

219
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,722
but it's really great once you get
past the crowds and the traffic

220
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:27,363
and that occasional mystery smell
you can't get out of your hair.

221
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:29,372
It's not so bad.
Hey, you know what?

222
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:32,080
Do you wanna come with me to the
Stella McCartney party tonight?

223
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,683
Come on. It would be really fun.
It's a V.I.P. invite.

224
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:38,542
V.I.P.? I've never
even been an I.P.

225
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:40,492
Me neither.
Feel this lettering.

226
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:42,023
- Oh. Oh, ooh.
- I know.

227
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:42,963
Charlie?

228
00:10:43,186 --> 00:10:45,150
- Henry.
- Henry.

229
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:46,993
- Betty.
- Hey.

230
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:48,512
- Hi.
- Hi.

231
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,101
Wow, I guess you
two already met.

232
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:53,752
Betty, this is my
girlfriend Charlie.

233
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:54,972
Hey.

236
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:31,161
Yes?

237
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:33,732
Uh, am I interrupting?

238
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,043
No, no, no. I'm just...

239
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:37,611
What, no lunch date?

240
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:39,952
No, I've just been so busy.

241
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:46,170
Maybe not so busy.

242
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:49,031
Perfect.

243
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:52,722
I have two tickets to "The Flying
Dutchman" at the Met tonight.

244
00:11:52,756 --> 00:11:54,650
I was thinking of maybe
a girls' night out.

245
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:58,033
We could start with drinks at the St.
Regis, and...

246
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,263
Oh, darling, what--what is it?

247
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:02,891
It's complicated...

248
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:05,621
coming back from the dead.

249
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:09,522
Please, Donna Karan does
it every three years.

250
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:14,163
I just didn't expect my
old friends to be so...

251
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:16,490
unforgiving.

252
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:19,702
Honey, you don't have to
apologize for who you are.

253
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:24,212
People cried at my funeral,
and now I'm back, and...

254
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:27,243
they want nothing
to do with me.

255
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:28,912
To hell with them.

256
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:31,672
One good friend
is all you need.

257
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:34,062
Thanks.

258
00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:53,420
Shh.

259
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,810
Hey,  accountant man,
looking for Betty?

260
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:58,130
She's right down here.

261
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:01,122
What? I'm bored.

262
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:05,903
Oh, hey, Henry.

263
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:09,182
I just, um, I lost a contact.

264
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:10,750
Not mine.

265
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:15,780
Listen, I just wanted to thank you
for getting Charlie to go out tonight.

266
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:18,911
All we've done since she got here is
order in and watch movies in bed.

267
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:22,650
Sounds... rough.

268
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:26,410
Um, so just tell her that I'll meet
up with her at 7:00. Okay, bye.

269
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:27,340
Betty.

270
00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:30,260
You--you sure this
isn't weird for you?

271
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:33,441
It's fine. It's totally fine.
Why would it be weird?

272
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:37,241
Well, you know, 'cause we--
there was that thing...

273
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,870
feeling... vibe... between us.

274
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:45,680
No. Uh, no,
there is no "us," so there was no...

275
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:48,721
vibe... feeling... thingy...

276
00:13:48,797 --> 00:13:50,133
to be felt.

277
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:51,263
Really?

278
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:53,291
Okay, then.

279
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:55,551
Good.

280
00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:57,623
Well, have fun tonight.

281
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:03,070
I'm still bored.

282
00:14:03,118 --> 00:14:05,451
Watching nerd love
is so tedious.

283
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:08,581
There is no love. We don't have
any love. He has a girlfriend.

284
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:11,890
Yeah, who you invited
to a party. Pathetica.

285
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:13,920
Well, I don't want to,
but I'm stuck.

286
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:15,812
Oh, grow a set, Bambi. 

287
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:17,362
You've been working
here long enough.

288
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:20,151
It is time to seize
your inner "Mode" girl.

289
00:14:20,185 --> 00:14:21,033
My what?

290
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,822
"Mode" girls aren't
the other woman.

291
00:14:22,857 --> 00:14:26,071
We are the only women.
Fight for your little dweeb.

292
00:14:26,107 --> 00:14:28,382
Find this chick's
weakness and exploit it.

293
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:31,292
No, that's terrible.
I'm just gonna take her to the party.

294
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:33,712
- I said I would and I will.
- Doormat.

295
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,572
Or  maybe I'm just a
bigger person than you.

296
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:37,703
Don't. It's too obvious.

297
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:42,641
A musical?

298
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:44,261
Forget it. I'm not going.

299
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:45,892
Would you--oh, come here.

300
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:48,080
Justin is the one who
wants you to come with us.

301
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:51,051
He made me get three tickets because
he wants to share this with you.

302
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:53,420
He shouldn't even be going
to see this kind of stuff.

303
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,591
You ever think that maybe
that's why he is the way he is?

304
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:56,542
Okay, stop.

305
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:59,131
You're the one who wants to
spend more time with your son.

306
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:03,710
All right, look.

307
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,072
I got money on the
basketball game tonight.

308
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:09,152
No, listen. How about I ride with
you guys into the city on the train?

309
00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:10,801
I'll catch the
game at some bar,

310
00:15:10,836 --> 00:15:13,021
and when the show's over,
I'll come pick you up.

311
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:17,111
Wow, father-son
bonding on the e train.

312
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:19,410
That's some real quality time.

313
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:27,643
That's "The Chin"?

314
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:29,493
Yep.

315
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:31,770
Why would you stand her up?

316
00:15:32,586 --> 00:15:34,803
Well, back in school
she was a mess.

317
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:38,501
She had braces and glasses
and this crazy hair...

318
00:15:40,135 --> 00:15:42,703
which totally works
for some people.

319
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:47,513
Would you please stop looking at
me like that and just send her in?

320
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:53,781
Miss Chin.

321
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:58,153
Hi, Grace. How are you?
Let me take that for you.

322
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:00,433
Please, have a seat.

323
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:04,081
Well, this is, uh...
it's, uh...

324
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:07,582
- awkward, isn't it?
- Is it?

325
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:09,462
Look, let me just start with...

326
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:14,123
- I'm an idiot.
- Great, and I'm a pisces.

327
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:16,381
Now do you want to discuss
your father's case?

328
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:20,762
Uh, so there's nothing we
need to discuss first?

329
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:23,641
You do realize I charge by the hour,
Mr. Meade.

330
00:16:23,677 --> 00:16:25,363
It's me. It's Daniel.

331
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:27,290
And I'm Grace. That was $40.

332
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:29,021
Wait a minute.
You don't remember?

333
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:31,303
Why should you? 

334
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:33,902
'Cause we've never met.

335
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:36,693
Okay... so I've had
a look at the case,

336
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:39,600
and I'll be honest with you.
It is not an easy one.

337
00:16:39,637 --> 00:16:41,473
But you've done the right
thing by calling me,

338
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:43,360
because I am the only
one who can win it.

339
00:16:43,398 --> 00:16:46,232
- Great! So you'll take it?
- Not a chance in hell.

340
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:49,220
Whoa, wait. You just said you're
the only one who could win it.

341
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,212
And  you said you were gonna meet me
at the Sigma Phi New Year's party.

342
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:53,351
Oh, crap.

343
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:58,011
And by the way, Cindy Howard pulled
that virgin act with everyone.

344
00:16:58,045 --> 00:16:59,282
So I've heard.

345
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:03,922
I was so excited about my
date with Daniel Meade.

346
00:17:04,507 --> 00:17:08,660
Instead I ended up back at the dorm room
playing "Wolfenstein" on my computer

347
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,810
all night long.

348
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:13,440
"Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein,
Wolfenstein"!

349
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:17,612
Thanks to you,
1995 started off with a bang...

350
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:20,133
or should I say, without one?

351
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:21,913
Grace--

352
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:24,253
I bought a corsage for you.

353
00:17:24,345 --> 00:17:26,942
I know that's weird,
but I was new to dating.

354
00:17:26,977 --> 00:17:29,243
Look, I was a jerk, okay?

355
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:30,751
I probably still am.

356
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:32,402
Too little, too late.

357
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:36,450
I only came here to see the look
on your face when I rejected you.

358
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:39,161
Grace, I--listen.
I know you don't owe me anything,

359
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:40,603
but this isn't about me.

360
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:41,943
It's about my father.

361
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,693
He didn't stand you up.

362
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:47,021
Isn't there anything I can
do to make it up to you?

363
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,322
Every vendor in this city is
closed because of the snow.

364
00:17:53,356 --> 00:17:57,112
Oh, right. You need fabric for
the Sarah Jessica Parker dress.

365
00:17:57,148 --> 00:17:58,862
I see the gay-p.b.
is in full force.

366
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:01,523
Oh, please, it's Carrie Bradshaw.
We're on level pink.

367
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:03,303
Oh, are these the designs?

368
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,900
Taffeta?

369
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:08,332
Taffe-don't, and you're not thinking
of putting her in an autumn palette.

370
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:10,132
She's totally a spring.
Come on.

371
00:18:10,337 --> 00:18:11,532
Do you know something?

372
00:18:12,015 --> 00:18:14,430
You're the one gay I don't like.
Now will you piss off?

373
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:16,242
- You're confusing me.
- Confusing you?

374
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:18,610
Try saving your career.

375
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:20,971
Now let's start over.

376
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,360
Start over?
I don't even have any fabric.

377
00:18:23,397 --> 00:18:27,460
Oh, shell-o.
Just repurpose something around here.

378
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:29,533
I can't.
This is Sarah Jessica Parker.

379
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:32,093
I can't just use something from
another designer. She'll know.

380
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,111
It'll burn her flesh.

381
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,183
And anyway,
she wants a McKinney original.

382
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:40,972
Okay, then we need to
think outside the box.

383
00:18:41,357 --> 00:18:42,492
"We"?

384
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:46,052
Yeah. Sometimes it's good
to be on a team. Oh!

385
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,031
Are you sure the subway's
the safest way to go?

386
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:56,672
Yeah, I'm positive.
Look, all the cabs are off duty, anyway.

387
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:58,752
Besides, the subway's
perfectly safe.

388
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:00,522
What about all the mole
people down there?

389
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:02,263
Oh, they're nice,
just misunderstood.

390
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:04,193
Oh, god. Are you okay?
Are you--

391
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:06,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

392
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:09,583
Oh, god. I don't know--

393
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:12,331
I don't know why Henry wants
to live in this city. I mean,

394
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:14,813
you know,
we need accountants in Tucson, too.

395
00:19:14,847 --> 00:19:17,670
Well, maybe he has
bigger dreams than that.

396
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,521
Here, stay close.

397
00:19:27,895 --> 00:19:30,170
Hey, like the music,
leave a dollar.

398
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:32,380
Thanks.

399
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:38,093
That was nice of you, but don't
you worry he'll spend it on crack?

400
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:41,331
Aw, Henry's girlfriend
thinks you're nice.

401
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:42,301
Hit her.

402
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:43,830
Amanda?

403
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:48,162
So what's your story?
Are you seeing anyone?

404
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:51,042
Um, nope, not anymore.

405
00:19:51,528 --> 00:19:52,813
Oh, his loss.

406
00:19:53,335 --> 00:19:55,361
I'm sure you're gonna
find someone great.

407
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:01,510
You did, and she took him.
She has got to go.

408
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:03,740
Just push Stevie Nicks
in front of the train.

409
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:20,311
God, this is crazy.
There's so many people.

410
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,991
Don't let go of my hand.

411
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:27,191
Here's your chance. Lose her.

412
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,871
She'll freak and be on
the next bus to Tucson.

413
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:34,732
- Ditch her.
- Ditch her.     - Ditch her.

414
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:40,962
Betty? Betty?

415
00:20:40,997 --> 00:20:42,992
No, no, no, no! No, Betty!

416
00:20:43,027 --> 00:20:44,531
I-I don't know what happened!

417
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:47,690
- Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty!
- Get off at the next stop!

418
00:20:47,728 --> 00:20:51,922
Get on the opposite train and come back!
I'll wait for you here!

419
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:57,072
Bitch move, Betty.

420
00:20:57,845 --> 00:20:58,893
Nice.

421
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,492
I can't get through.
There's no signal.

422
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,363
Well, here, try the pay phone.

423
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:09,033
Or not.

424
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,862
Ew, wet.

425
00:21:10,897 --> 00:21:12,862
I don't understand.
How did this even happen?

426
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:16,533
Well, it was...
sort of--kind of an accident.

427
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,831
There were a lot of people,
and everyone was shoving,

428
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:21,301
and the doors just closed.

429
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:22,983
Great. Great.

430
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:24,893
She's on the subway by herself.

431
00:21:24,928 --> 00:21:26,393
She's already
terrified of New York.

432
00:21:26,427 --> 00:21:29,711
I know. I feel so bad, Henry.
I'm... I'm sorry.

433
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:31,322
Betty, it's not your fault.

434
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:34,770
Actually, it is--it is.

435
00:21:36,636 --> 00:21:39,723
I think that I kind of...

436
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:43,141
lost Charlie... on purpose.

437
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:50,103
I am so sorry
about this, Alexis.

438
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:53,120
We will find a driver that
actually does have snow tires.

439
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:56,141
But don't worry,
I've never missed a curtain at the Met.

440
00:21:56,176 --> 00:21:59,650
No big deal. You know,
I used to come to places like this...

441
00:21:59,836 --> 00:22:00,893
before.

442
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:03,192
Why don't we sit and have
a drink while we wait?

443
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:05,821
- Peanut?
- No, thanks.

444
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:08,570
The band-aid in the bowl
puts me off a little.

445
00:22:10,356 --> 00:22:11,442
Heads up!

446
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,540
That was you.

447
00:22:15,706 --> 00:22:17,903
I threw that like
a girl, right?

448
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,640
I knew it--20 to 8:00.
I told you we should've left earlier.

449
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,200
I promise you,
we'll make the overture.

450
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:31,373
Mom, I appreciate the
whole effort thing,

451
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:34,630
but everyone knows that there's
no overture in "Hairspray."

452
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:37,132
Yeah, Hilda.
Everyone knows that.

453
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:41,010
Is there something you
wanna tell your son, Santos?

454
00:22:43,415 --> 00:22:46,943
Yo, Justin, about tonight,
mijo, I don't--

455
00:22:46,976 --> 00:22:49,292
No way. This is not happening.

456
00:22:50,397 --> 00:22:52,910
Why, God, why?

457
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:57,681
Staples? Envelopes?
Coffee filters?

458
00:22:57,715 --> 00:22:59,451
You were supposed to
be looking for fabric.

459
00:22:59,485 --> 00:23:01,160
Yeah, there's none
in the building.

460
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:04,362
But we don't need it.
Think "Project Runway."

461
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:06,833
Those people made dresses
out of corn husks.

462
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:10,143
If I told you these were from Paris,
you'd pay 1,000 bucks for them.

463
00:23:10,177 --> 00:23:11,613
I can't do this.
I'm gonna say "no."

464
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:14,812
No! You do not say no to
Sarah Jessica Parker.

465
00:23:14,846 --> 00:23:17,142
She's the holy
grail of fashion.

466
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:17,902
I know!

467
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:21,122
This is your big chance,
and my big chance to meet her husband--

468
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:23,940
Ferris Bueller Parker.
Here, hold this. Spin.

469
00:23:23,988 --> 00:23:26,431
Mm. You may not get a call
like this again, Christina.

470
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:28,410
You have to do this.
Make it work.

471
00:23:28,445 --> 00:23:30,922
- She does have a quirky style.
- Quirky style.

472
00:24:04,738 --> 00:24:07,682
No, no, no, you can't be closing.
It's just a little snow.

473
00:24:07,768 --> 00:24:09,273
I-I don't need a waiter.

474
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:11,571
I don't need a cook.
I just need a table for two

475
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:14,282
with some candles and a few flowers.
That's it.

476
00:24:15,526 --> 00:24:17,842
This is Daniel Meade.
Do you know that?

477
00:24:18,778 --> 00:24:20,683
Hello? Hello--

478
00:24:22,248 --> 00:24:23,823
That used to mean something.

479
00:24:24,268 --> 00:24:26,523
- Should've used my name.
- Hey.

480
00:24:27,338 --> 00:24:29,082
Thanks for meeting me here.

481
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:31,460
So what's the big surprise?

482
00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:35,663
Actually, I was planning, um,
this amazing dinner at Babbo, but--

483
00:24:35,696 --> 00:24:37,372
Let me guess--you're
blowing me off again.

484
00:24:37,406 --> 00:24:40,743
No, no, no, no, it's not me.
It's the stupid blizzard.

485
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,551
Grace, I just wanted to give you
the New Year's Eve we never had.

486
00:24:44,587 --> 00:24:47,800
Oh. Then maybe I should stand
out in the snow for three hours

487
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:49,600
and cry icicle tears.

488
00:24:49,718 --> 00:24:51,310
Worked on that one for a while?

489
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:52,692
12 years.

490
00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:55,891
Look, we can still do this.

491
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:59,320
Grace, we--we got party hats,
we got--we got noisemakers.

492
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:01,890
Look at this gift basket
Paul Smith sent over.

493
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:04,053
We can have a lot
of fun right here.

494
00:25:04,986 --> 00:25:06,550
- Drink?
- I don't drink.

495
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:08,541
- Do you eat?
- Not often.

496
00:25:08,577 --> 00:25:11,312
Listen, did you really think
it was gonna be that easy?

497
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:14,853
I would just come over here, and we'd
have a few laughs about that night?

498
00:25:14,885 --> 00:25:17,590
I wasn't the only one you
hurt in college, Daniel.

499
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:19,432
Let's see.

500
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:22,360
Julie Dwyer--remember her?

501
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:24,423
- Not, uh...
- Exactly.

502
00:25:24,715 --> 00:25:28,723
Julie now has a husband,
two kids and a dog.

503
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,091
Well, that's great.

504
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:31,940
In her mind.

505
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:33,861
She's in a mental institution.

506
00:25:33,897 --> 00:25:35,323
Way to go, Daniel.

507
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:38,472
Does the name "Sarah
Hayden" ring a bell?

508
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:44,172
Sarah now has the largest "Indigo
Girls" fan site on the internet.

509
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:45,620
Are you gonna kill me?

510
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:46,830
No.

511
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,771
I am gonna make you apologize.

512
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:53,483
If you want me to even consider
taking your father's case,

513
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:57,081
you're gonna make it up to every
woman you ever hurt in college.

514
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,600
Oh, yeah.

515
00:26:00,188 --> 00:26:02,711
The Chin's all about justice.

516
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:08,983
I swear the town car will
be there within 15 minutes.

517
00:26:09,018 --> 00:26:11,713
- Ow! That's flesh.
- Well, don't move.

518
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,523
What's going on over there?

519
00:26:13,556 --> 00:26:15,803
Christy and I are making a
dress for Sarah Jessica Parker.

520
00:26:15,838 --> 00:26:17,231
I need a staple gun.

521
00:26:17,656 --> 00:26:20,533
"Christy"? I take it
she's on our team?

522
00:26:20,565 --> 00:26:22,542
Oh, we are so besties.

523
00:26:22,578 --> 00:26:24,293
She taught me how to
do a butterfly stitch.

524
00:26:24,305 --> 00:26:26,981
Perfect. I want the two of you
to be braiding each other's hair

525
00:26:27,016 --> 00:26:28,493
before the night's over.

526
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:33,983
Whoo-hoo-hoo. Come on, WNBA.
The girl's on fire!

527
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,150
That's just lucky.

528
00:26:35,186 --> 00:26:37,631
Actually, I'm the
one who's lucky.

529
00:26:37,668 --> 00:26:40,081
No blizzard tonight,
and I'd be home on Staten Island,

530
00:26:40,117 --> 00:26:41,971
and I wouldn't be
here with you.

531
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:45,682
I'm Joel, by the way.

532
00:26:46,226 --> 00:26:48,270
- Alexis.
- Alexis.

533
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:49,981
Can I buy you a cocktail?

534
00:26:50,267 --> 00:26:54,553
Um, I won't be staying very long.
My friend has tickets to the opera.

535
00:26:54,587 --> 00:26:57,210
- Oh, that sucks.
- Tell me about it.

536
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,561
How about one more
game before you leave?

537
00:27:00,445 --> 00:27:01,710
All right.

538
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:05,540
Good news.
Marc found us a town car.

539
00:27:05,575 --> 00:27:07,773
- Oh, great.
- You look familiar.

540
00:27:07,805 --> 00:27:09,722
- Have we met?
- We're not even meeting now.

541
00:27:09,757 --> 00:27:11,400
Let's wait outside. Come on.

542
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:16,620
Willy, any chance you wanna skip
the Met and stick around here?

543
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:18,860
What? Are you serious?

544
00:27:18,895 --> 00:27:21,083
This was the plan.
We had girls' night out.

545
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:23,460
Well, isn't the point of girls'
night about meeting guys?

546
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:26,902
I mean, look, he's cute,
and he has friends.

547
00:27:27,086 --> 00:27:29,241
Oh, dear god.

548
00:27:29,276 --> 00:27:32,162
Come on, one shot.
What do you say? It's free!

549
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,642
Come on.

550
00:27:36,317 --> 00:27:37,220
Yeah.

551
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:40,861
All right, here we go.

552
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:50,380
Nice release.

553
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:55,002
One minute until curtain.

554
00:27:55,036 --> 00:27:57,872
This is the worst thing that's ever
happened, and I am not exaggerating.

555
00:27:57,906 --> 00:28:00,390
Justin, honey,
you know the whole show inside and out.

556
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:02,200
If you miss some of it,
you know how it starts.

557
00:28:02,236 --> 00:28:03,682
But dad doesn't!

558
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:06,170
And the curtain is up.

559
00:28:06,437 --> 00:28:09,062
I am so sorry.

560
00:28:09,096 --> 00:28:10,671
I think I'll be okay.

561
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:14,472
It's too bad.
I know you really wanted to see it.

562
00:28:15,546 --> 00:28:16,742
Idea!

563
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:18,042
I'll catch you up.

564
00:28:18,235 --> 00:28:19,651
Let me set the scene.

565
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:23,183
Baltimore, 1962--

566
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:26,601
the height of segregation and the
beginning of the teenybop revolution.

567
00:28:26,636 --> 00:28:28,221
Our heroine's...

568
00:28:28,857 --> 00:28:30,273
Tracy Turnblad--

569
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:32,231
chubby, but totally adorable.

570
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:35,483
She wakes and begins to sing.
Excuse me.

571
00:28:36,435 --> 00:28:39,653
# Oh, oh, oh, woke up today #

572
00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:43,761
# Feeling the way I always do #

573
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:47,083
# Good morning, Baltimore #

574
00:28:47,117 --> 00:28:50,522
# Every day's like
an open door #

575
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:53,611
# Every night is a fantasy #

576
00:28:53,776 --> 00:28:57,350
# Every sound's
like a symphony #

577
00:28:57,387 --> 00:29:00,863
# Good morning, Baltimore #

578
00:29:02,118 --> 00:29:03,200
Excuse me.

579
00:29:03,236 --> 00:29:06,503
Ay, Justin, honey, don't dance near
the guy with his hand under his coat.

580
00:29:12,107 --> 00:29:14,891
I don't understand. Did something
happen between you and Charlie?

581
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,903
No. Nothing.

582
00:29:18,246 --> 00:29:19,610
Did she say something?

583
00:29:19,976 --> 00:29:21,031
No.

584
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:26,142
Well, then I-I don't get it.
You just don't like her?

585
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:27,670
- No, I like her.
- Then what's the problem?

586
00:29:27,706 --> 00:29:29,021
I like you, too!

587
00:29:29,056 --> 00:29:30,542
There. I said it.

588
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,540
Why--why didn't you tell me?

589
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:37,262
Why didn't you tell me
you had a girlfriend?

590
00:29:37,298 --> 00:29:39,640
- Because you have a boyfriend.
- Who I broke up with...

591
00:29:39,675 --> 00:29:41,500
- What?
- For you.

592
00:29:50,265 --> 00:29:53,121
I've thought a lot
about what I did to you.

593
00:29:53,685 --> 00:29:55,341
I'm so sorry.

594
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,713
I never meant to hurt you.

595
00:30:00,695 --> 00:30:03,092
Okay, so... thank you, nurse.

596
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:06,882
You'll make sure to give Julie that
message when she gets out of the quiet room?

597
00:30:07,888 --> 00:30:09,442
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

598
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:16,652
Okay, so, um,
Debra Rossner is next.

599
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,892
You know,
you actually sound sincere.

600
00:30:21,496 --> 00:30:24,111
You really would do anything
to help your father.

601
00:30:25,118 --> 00:30:28,462
Come on. It's not like I don't regret
some of the things I've done in life.

602
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:33,281
You know, your sadness is...

603
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:36,833
kind of a turn-on.

604
00:30:41,025 --> 00:30:42,963
The Chin likes remorse.

605
00:30:45,638 --> 00:30:49,002
I am sad. I am so sad.

606
00:30:49,036 --> 00:30:51,251
Shh. Don't talk.
You'll ruin it.

607
00:30:56,017 --> 00:30:58,412
Hello? Hello?

608
00:30:58,446 --> 00:31:00,770
Daniel, you there?

609
00:31:01,085 --> 00:31:03,511
How many more of these calls
am I gonna have to take?

610
00:31:04,415 --> 00:31:06,302
Okay, I'm hanging up.

611
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:11,263
Okay. I'm not hanging up.

612
00:31:12,177 --> 00:31:13,300
Nice.

613
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:24,561
Alexis, our driver's here.

614
00:31:24,597 --> 00:31:26,632
Oh, Willy,
would you hate me if I didn't go?

615
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:28,843
Opera's totally wasted on me.

616
00:31:28,878 --> 00:31:30,652
- Yes!
- What'd I miss?

617
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,180
Sweet 3-pointer.

618
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:34,922
So much for our night.

619
00:31:47,507 --> 00:31:48,913
What's this?

620
00:31:49,186 --> 00:31:51,833
Hopefully your phone number.

621
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,200
Got it!

622
00:32:11,578 --> 00:32:13,720
- What's going on?
- My boys back there bet me

623
00:32:13,756 --> 00:32:16,180
I didn't have the stones
to get your phone number.

624
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:19,682
I don't live in a cave, dude.

625
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,262
I know exactly who you are,

626
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:25,450
and I don't hit on freaks

627
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:28,220
unless I know I'm
getting paid for it.

628
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,071
Pardon me. You know, Joel,

629
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:35,562
I was rude not to introduce
myself to you earlier.

630
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:42,192
That's what friends are for.
Come on.

631
00:32:47,106 --> 00:32:50,150
Tracy totally ends up dancing
on "The Corny Collins Show."

632
00:32:50,188 --> 00:32:51,281
It's way satisfying.

633
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:53,620
And then she has
this killer song--

634
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:56,630
Hey, kid.
Think maybe we've had enough?

635
00:32:59,885 --> 00:33:00,942
Fairy.

636
00:33:00,976 --> 00:33:02,603
Excuse me?

637
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:03,961
No, no, no, hold on.

638
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:08,471
Hey, you got
something to say, man?

639
00:33:09,305 --> 00:33:10,541
Dígame, chico.

640
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:14,732
And now my son's gonna finish
telling me about the "Hairspray."

641
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:17,132
And when he's done,
you better clap.

642
00:33:17,165 --> 00:33:18,163
All right?

643
00:33:29,268 --> 00:33:31,891
Keep going, mijo.
I wanna know what happens to Tracy.

644
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,301
And you're right.
It's way satisfying.

645
00:33:38,188 --> 00:33:39,403
Reprise...

646
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:51,212
Oh, let it go, sweetie.

647
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:54,993
Two weeks ago,
that idiot wasn't even walking upright.

648
00:33:56,157 --> 00:33:59,970
I had all these ideas of how
it would be when I came back.

649
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:04,833
But people are kind of awful.

650
00:34:06,808 --> 00:34:11,312
Well, don't forget, there are some
people that have been good to you.

651
00:34:11,346 --> 00:34:12,570
You have...

652
00:34:17,137 --> 00:34:18,553
and so has Daniel.

653
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:21,923
What?

654
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:25,053
I thought he'd reject
me like my father did,

655
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:26,533
but he didn't.

656
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,730
Uh, okay,
now you're making me nervous.

657
00:34:29,088 --> 00:34:31,692
You are going to fire Daniel

658
00:34:31,727 --> 00:34:33,810
and make me editor
in chief, right?

659
00:34:33,848 --> 00:34:35,791
He's my brother, Willy.

660
00:34:35,828 --> 00:34:37,570
He is the enemy.

661
00:34:37,607 --> 00:34:39,262
See, that's the thing.

662
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:42,220
I've kind of realized he's not.

663
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:44,163
But think about
what you're saying.

664
00:34:44,568 --> 00:34:46,050
We worked for months--

665
00:34:46,088 --> 00:34:49,143
Look, you're the best creative
director in the business.

666
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,601
We can talk about salary.

667
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:53,580
- Stop the car.
- Willy...

668
00:34:54,037 --> 00:34:56,511
You know,
you may be new at being a woman,

669
00:34:56,606 --> 00:34:59,033
but you're an old
pro at being a bitch.

670
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:15,113
Betty, can we talk?

671
00:35:15,145 --> 00:35:17,522
No. I'm getting some food,
and I'm going home.

672
00:35:17,557 --> 00:35:19,362
Please tell Charlie
that I'm sorry.

673
00:35:19,398 --> 00:35:21,130
At least let me pay
for your pretzel.

674
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:23,011
No, I don't want
anything from you.

675
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,633
Okay, a dollar.

676
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:29,183
- Thank you.
- You're... welcome.

677
00:35:30,286 --> 00:35:32,601
Betty, here.
I know you like extra mustard--

678
00:35:32,635 --> 00:35:35,710
Listen, Walter and
I--it wasn't about you.

679
00:35:35,988 --> 00:35:38,493
I broke up with him because I
wasn't in love with him anymore,

680
00:35:38,526 --> 00:35:40,652
and I don't know why I
blamed it on you.

681
00:35:41,136 --> 00:35:43,040
Maybe it was easier.

682
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:51,851
Well...

683
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:55,511
if you didn't love him,
then you did the right thing.

684
00:35:59,906 --> 00:36:01,172
Timing sucks.

685
00:36:07,526 --> 00:36:10,602
Well, now you'll probably
meet someone new...

686
00:36:12,566 --> 00:36:14,750
someone who'll see how
wonderful you are...

687
00:36:17,435 --> 00:36:19,692
and caring...

688
00:36:24,427 --> 00:36:25,683
and beautiful.

689
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,381
Is this a good idea?

690
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:39,563
No.

691
00:36:40,078 --> 00:36:41,171
Henry!

692
00:36:41,686 --> 00:36:42,740
Charlie?

693
00:36:42,777 --> 00:36:44,533
- Charlie!
- Betty!

694
00:36:49,435 --> 00:36:50,901
Oh, uh, are you okay?

695
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:53,301
Oh, that subway ride rocked!

696
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,783
People are so nice
in this city!

697
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,082
There was this one guy--he
kind of touched my butt,

698
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,953
but after I maced him,
he totally got me on the right train!

699
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,453
So you like New York?

700
00:37:02,538 --> 00:37:05,363
Oh, I heart New York.

701
00:37:05,905 --> 00:37:09,011
Honey, oh, honey, I'm staying.

702
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:11,733
I wanna try and
make it work here.

703
00:37:12,048 --> 00:37:15,173
Oh, and, Betty--oh, oh,
Betty, it was like--

704
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:18,023
it was like fate that
got us separated.

705
00:37:18,055 --> 00:37:20,962
Yeah. Yeah, fate's awesome.

706
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:25,072
So are we still gonna
go to that party?

707
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:28,671
Because we could just get on the
d train and change at Chambers.

708
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:31,911
I totally sound
like a New Yorker.

709
00:37:34,457 --> 00:37:35,633
That was my shoe.

710
00:37:35,665 --> 00:37:36,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

711
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:41,970
You know what?
Um, I think I'm gonna go home.

712
00:37:42,005 --> 00:37:43,642
You guys go to the party.

713
00:37:43,905 --> 00:37:45,853
Henry should be your plus one.

714
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:49,831
- Betty...
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.

715
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:52,662
So, um, I'll see you tomorrow.

716
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:01,500
Hello, media!

717
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:04,323
It's amazing what you can
accomplish when you're sober.

718
00:38:04,357 --> 00:38:05,660
Harsh words.

719
00:38:05,696 --> 00:38:07,602
And Sarah Jessica's gonna love.

720
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:08,661
I know!

721
00:38:08,695 --> 00:38:09,921
Listen up, people.

722
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:12,180
Our dear friend Alexis
has betrayed us.

723
00:38:12,216 --> 00:38:14,883
She's keeping Daniel
as editor in chief.

724
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:16,020
What?

725
00:38:16,057 --> 00:38:18,723
Don't worry. I'm not going
gently into this good night.

726
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:20,190
We need a new plan.

727
00:38:20,225 --> 00:38:22,881
Excuse me.
Where do you think you're going?

728
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,081
I'm not one of your flying
monkeys, Wilhelmina.

729
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:29,382
Like hell you aren't.
I gave you your wings.

730
00:38:29,418 --> 00:38:31,621
Sarah Jessica Parker
wouldn't even know your name

731
00:38:31,658 --> 00:38:34,082
if I hadn't put you
in fashion week.

732
00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:36,271
Don't cross me, sweetheart,

733
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:38,101
'cause you'll lose.

734
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,972
So, uh,
let's talk about your father's case.

735
00:38:46,006 --> 00:38:48,913
Now? It's kind of
a buzz kill, no?

736
00:38:48,945 --> 00:38:50,593
Ooh, not for me.

737
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,172
The law makes me hot.

738
00:38:58,226 --> 00:39:01,143
My friend at the D.A.'s office told
me the case against your father

739
00:39:01,177 --> 00:39:03,961
isn't as strong as they're
leading everyone to believe.

740
00:39:03,997 --> 00:39:06,792
All right, quick,
before the blood leaves my brain--

741
00:39:06,828 --> 00:39:08,122
How so?

742
00:39:08,155 --> 00:39:10,991
Mostly circumstantial evidence, really.
Barely a motive.

743
00:39:11,026 --> 00:39:14,532
Plus they can't even track down
their star witness. Person's a ghost.

744
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:17,022
What do you mean?

745
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:19,970
Mmm, a couple of other
witnesses claim they saw

746
00:39:20,005 --> 00:39:22,750
a blue Aston Martin stopped on
the other side of the road.

747
00:39:22,786 --> 00:39:24,883
Probably saw the
whole accident.

748
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:27,320
No luck tracking the
witness down, though.

749
00:39:30,646 --> 00:39:32,332
Blue Aston Martin?

750
00:39:39,118 --> 00:39:43,283
Why would you tell our son's
assistant that you killed Fey?

751
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:45,702
Our family is falling apart.

752
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:47,360
Don't get angry at me.

753
00:39:47,415 --> 00:39:50,540
You were supposed to stay quiet
and let me handle everything.

754
00:39:50,577 --> 00:39:52,472
And look where it got you.

755
00:39:53,698 --> 00:39:55,331
You're here because of me,

756
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,301
because of what I did.

757
00:40:01,095 --> 00:40:02,843
I'm turning myself in.

758
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:05,432
No! Claire?

759
00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:06,763
Claire!

760
00:40:10,218 --> 00:40:11,263
Claire!

761
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:17,290
Claire.

762
00:40:22,315 --> 00:40:24,700
Hello. Christina McKinney.

763
00:40:25,146 --> 00:40:26,241
Yes.

764
00:40:26,546 --> 00:40:27,702
Oh, yeah.

765
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:31,171
Oh. Right.

766
00:40:31,738 --> 00:40:34,582
No, no, no, no, no. It's fine.

767
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,970
Of course,
I-I understand completely.

768
00:40:37,006 --> 00:40:40,350
It's... just... okay.

769
00:40:40,697 --> 00:40:41,883
Bye.

770
00:40:45,115 --> 00:40:47,332
That was Sarah Jessica
Parker's people.

771
00:40:47,366 --> 00:40:49,073
They're going with
another designer.

772
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:56,413
Wilhelmina works quickly,
doesn't she?

773
00:41:00,315 --> 00:41:01,950
It gets easier.

774
00:41:06,555 --> 00:41:07,810
Yes, Willy.

775
00:41:08,497 --> 00:41:10,251
Oh, I'll get right on it.

776
00:41:10,675 --> 00:41:14,330
Yes. I promise you,
the town car's on its way.

777
00:41:14,427 --> 00:41:15,660
No, I...

778
00:41:15,797 --> 00:41:17,651
Yes, of course.
