1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,530
This is for your father--

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,590
loaded with antioxidants and good for his heart muscle.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,460
Ignacio suarez drinking pomegranate juice.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,410
He used to hate this stuff.

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,710
Elena,you are a miracle worker.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,050
Just doing my job.

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,220
Try it.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,650
Pomegranate ice was my idea,you know.

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,060
Oh,here we go.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,180
Way before it was in the stores. 
Way before.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,750
And now some lady who stole my idea is 
living in a mansion in beverly hills.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,150
I should be in beverly hills.

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,050
No,i should be living in beverly hills.

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,440
You don't want to live in beverly hills,okay?

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,730
I worked there for a year--

16
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,500
bunch of stuck-up old hags with pulled-up faces...

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,840
and their wives.

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,400
good morning,familia!

19
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,570
It's a beautiful 30-degree day in queens,new york.

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,710
Perfect weather for a brisky,blood-pumping walk.

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,670
I don't think "brisky's" a word.

22
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:03,990
It is today.

23
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,860
Ignacio,you gotta drink your juice before your walk.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,050
Crazy idea. We can drink and walk at the same time.

25
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,500
Have a nice walk!

26
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,330
Yeah,have fun!

27
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,690
Wow,I am so happy.

28
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,440
I can't believe how quickly papi has 
bounced back from his heart attack.

29
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,620
I know,and how great is elena?

30
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,550
She's like the big sister I never had.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,200
Ay,now I know how important I am to you.

32
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,630
Well,she is amazing...

33
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,370
and it's just so nice not to have to worry.

34
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,130
I know.I'll see you later.

35
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,170
Ms. Meade?

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,560
Good morning,betty.

37
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,150
I tried to reach daniel.

38
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,040
I'm in a bit of a pickle.

39
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,820
Could you come to the drugstore at 58th 
and lex and bring some cash?

40
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,320
There's been a misunderstanding.

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,920
I apprehended the suspec leaving 
the store with this in her purse.

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,980
okay.

43
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,540
Well,first of all,
you don't have to call her a "suspect."

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,710
It's claire meade.

45
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,780
I don't care who she is.

46
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,620
Woman got the sticky fingers.

47
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,240
Oh,mrs. Meade,did you shoplift?

48
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,550
Oh,betty,it is not shoplifting 
if you can afford the item

49
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,320
but simply do not have the funds on you.

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,300
Wait. What? That--

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,410
I think that is shoplifting.

52
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,880
Well,we could debate this all day.

53
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,540
Betty,why don't you pay the man his $24?

54
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,990
And we'll be on our way curtis,have a nice day.

55
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,350
shoplifting? 
I don't even know what that means.

56
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,210
Yeah,neither did your mother.

57
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,790
Look,do you think something could be going on with her,

58
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,110
something that could be provoking all of this?

59
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,650
Well...

60
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,460
oh!

61
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,580
Oh?

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,460
Yeah. 6-0,actually.

63
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,070
It's her 60th birthday next week.

64
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,830
Wow. Well,that could freak someone out.

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,480
Maybe she just needs a little attention.

66
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,810
You know,I always tell her 
she doesn't get out enough and meet people.

67
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,760
hey,we could throw her a surprise party.

68
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,230
That's a good idea. You know what?

69
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,790
She loves a party.

70
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,100
You know what else we could do?

71
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,640
A tribute video.

72
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,930
A tribute video?

73
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,120
Wow,that,sounds like a lot of work.

74
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,390
That's okay.I could do it.

75
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,050
Really?

76
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,880
Yeah. I mean,your mom has always been 
so great to me and--and my family.

77
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,400
I-I wanna do this for her.
Do you have any old home movies I can watch?

78
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,310
joy to the world

79
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,010
and all that stuff

80
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,260
let's see how much dough santa spent.

81
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,350
oh,my... balls.

82
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,270
This tree is overdecorated.

83
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,030
Wow,it's kinda hard to watch it.

84
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,370
Yeah. Also kinda hard to live it.

85
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,920
And they're all pretty much the same.

86
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,000
Though the 4th of july barbecue-in-the-pool 
spectacular is pretty damn entertaining.

87
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,840
Yikes. Well,I'm sure I can find something in here.

88
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,520
And,hey,if you get me a camera,
I could interview her friends and family

89
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,750
saying nice things about her and 
then edit that into a warm,wonderful video.

90
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,720
Great.

91
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,860
Hello,daniel.

92
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,660
Mrs. Meade.

93
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,710
Hey,mom,I was just coming to see you.

94
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,630
I know,I know.

95
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,810
I'm due for a talking-to after my little bout 
with the drugstore police this morning,

96
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,430
but I thought it might be more pleasant to do it over dinner.

97
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,740
How about michael's at 8:00?

98
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,960
That sounds great,but I ac--

99
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,600
oh,great. I'll call and see 
if he'll make your favorite--

100
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,390
spaghetti and meatballs.

101
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,710
well,they're good.

102
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,690
hey,mom.

103
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,430
Uh,you know,I'd really love to do that,

104
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,360
but molly has a surprise special date planned.

105
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,290
Oh. Well,that's fine then.

106
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,550
But,um,you know,we should do something fun together.

107
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,560
Maybe just later in the week.

108
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,600
That would be nice.

109
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,250
We better make sure this party is good.

110
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,880
Oh,we will.

111
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,740
justin?

112
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,520
justin.

113
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,870
How do I know if this thing is on?

114
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,320
You see the red light?

115
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,910
If it's on,then you're recording.

116
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,130
How did you know that?

117
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,760
I'm a teenager.Technology doesn't faze me.

118
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,770
Betty,what are you doing with that camera?

119
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,730
Are you filming something?

120
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,340
Uh,yes,hilda,I am.

121
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,610
Which you obviously know,

122
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,570
because you are dressed like J.Lo on the red carpet.

123
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,260
What are you talking about?

124
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,480
I always act like this.

125
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,300
Mom.

126
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,670
What? If we're doing home movies,
I wanna look good.

127
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,850
I want my grandchildren to see how hot I was.

128
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,920
Disturbing.

129
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,990
Ay. Please.

130
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,970
We're not really making home videos.
I'm just practicing.

131
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,090
But I promise,when I'm done with claire's video,
you can get all glammed up again,okay?

132
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,430
All right.

133
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,830
How do I turn this off?

134
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,520
Red button.

135
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,400
you want me to make dinner?

136
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,280
- no. 
- Why?

137
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,850
you know,I'm not really sure this was a good idea.

138
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,680
Well,loosen up.It'll all come back to you.

139
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,570
Yeah,but I never really learned how to skate.

140
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,650
I was always the kid with the double blades on.

141
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,750
No,look,you're doing great.

142
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,250
This isn't so bad.

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But--

144
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,400
watch what you're doing,you dumb-ass.

145
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,330
Oh. You.

146
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,370
well,this is awkward.

147
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,800
is it?What,just because my ex-fiance is 
here with her new boyfriend

148
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,960
who's my mate?

149
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,720
You're here with your girlfriend.

150
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,500
You know what?We've been skating for a while.

151
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,230
We're gonna go.

152
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,820
No,you stay. We'll go.

153
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,350
Oi! Look,this is ridiculous.

154
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,460
Come on,what's the big deal?We're all grown-ups.

155
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,900
it was,uh,in bhutan,winter of 2002.

156
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,890
We took the elephants up into the hills.

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,330
it was 2006,actually.

158
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,960
You remember how weird that guide was?

159
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,410
Oh! He was a freak!

160
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,920
and then it got dark.

161
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,730
the elephants.

162
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,060
We slept in the forest with the elephants.

163
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,520
Yeah. Then it rained all the way back.

164
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,300
oh,yeah.

165
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,820
Oh! And molly gets these terrible rashes from wet clothes.

166
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,510
Awful,giant red blotches.

167
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,060
I could only imagine.

168
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,490
Are they painful?

169
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,810
So,of course,molly went home disappointed.

170
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,430
Well,I'd hoped to make it up to tibet,
and we never got the chance.

171
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,080
I've always wanted to go. And the food is incredible.

172
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,750
I didn't know they had food.

173
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,390
I mean,tibetan food.Who knew?

174
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,650
It's getting late.

175
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,790
Yeah,it's,uh,7:30,

176
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,430
- so we should probably- 
- are you ready?

177
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,700
Never been more.

178
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,600
oh,daniel,great!I'm glad you're here.

179
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,320
I want to interview you for your mom's video.

180
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,850
Yeah,before we do that,can we check to see

181
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,990
if there are any direct flights,J.F.K. To tibet?

182
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,010
Tibet?

183
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,750
Yeah,I just thought it'd be a nice surprise trip for molly and me.

184
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,000
She's always wanted to go.

185
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,720
Wow,uh,that's,

186
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,270
what,too much?

187
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,350
Kinda.

188
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,950
Uh,not to mention we might run into some visa issues,

189
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,280
a military occupation,civil unrest...

190
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,300
yeah,but the food is supposed to be excellent.

191
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,990
Besides,I want to do something special with molly.

192
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,430
She has all these...amazing memories with connor.

193
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,680
Well,you'll get there.

194
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,380
It just takes a little time.

195
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,080
Betty,that's what I'm worried about.

196
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,840
I don't exactly have the best track record 
when it comes to long-term relationships.

197
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,190
Molly's different.I see you two together.

198
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,420
You will get there,but it might be a good idea 
to start a little closer to home.

199
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,670
Okay.

200
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,700
you know what?You're right.

201
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,570
Let's do this interview.

202
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,870
Great.

203
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,490
- That's weird. - What?

204
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,040
It won't record.

205
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,350
Maybe 'cause it's full?

206
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,690
Impossible. It's just probably broken.

207
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,540
I only used it for ten minutes.

208
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,850
Here.

209
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,570
Okay.

210
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,720
No,not broken.

211
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,810
Just a lot of great shots of your front hall.

212
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,080
Front hall,front hall...

213
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,820
oh,wait.

214
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,080
Uh,there's something.

215
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,940
It's your father and... oh.

216
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,610
What?

217
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,930
nothing.

218
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,140
What?

219
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,880
oh,that's just my dad and his nurse.

220
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,260
oh,my god.

224
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,170
see? There!

225
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,820
I don't know.

226
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,700
You don't know?You don't know what?

227
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,570
He's grabbing her booty.

228
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,900
It's a very vague area.

229
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,430
Sort of her hip,lower backside.

230
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,180
Hilda,he is in there.

231
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,820
Fine.

232
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,630
we have to talk to dad.

233
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,950
and say what?

234
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,660
"Papi,we saw you going for the junk 
in your nurse's trunk"?

235
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,850
Yes.

236
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,670
she could sue us for harassment.

237
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,570
Elena is not gonna sue us.

238
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,050
Well,what if she quits?

239
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,310
Oh,no. No,no,no.

240
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,410
We cannot lose her.

241
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,870
See? So then we have to deal with it.

242
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,400
ay.

243
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,830
Fine. I'll talk to elena,and you talk to papi.

244
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,490
No,why do I have to talk to papi?

245
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,370
Yes,'cause this was your idea.

246
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,420
What,you think I'm gonna ask dad

247
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,060
if he's turning into the booty bandit of jackson heights?

248
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,170
No.

249
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,660
Okay,fine.

250
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,650
This is a wonderful idea.

251
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,450
I never come into the city anymore.

252
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,890
Yeah,well,I thought it would be really nice 
for us to have lunch together.

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,530
Um,and there's something I wanted to ask you.

254
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,970
I'm just not quite sure how to bring it up.

255
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,600
Did my father grab a handful of your ass last night?

256
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,540
Of course,sweetheart,I do miss eating cupcakes,

257
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,060
but why would that be awkward to ask?

258
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,680
Well,'cause I know elena's been 
pretty strict on your diet.

259
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,250
Oh,hey,since you brought her up,

260
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,400
how are things going with her,everything okay?

261
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,800
'Cause I wouldn't want to lose you 
if papi accidentally slipped

262
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,800
and tried to brace himself on your butt.

263
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,800
Don't worry about your father,hilda. 
He's a lovely man.

264
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,480
excuse me.Too much pomegranate.

265
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,690
I'm just saying,you know,
we can always get someone else,like a male nurse,

266
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,900
if you feel uncomfortable having a woman around all the time.

267
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,540
No. I'm usedo it. I've got two daughters,remember?

268
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,510
If he got out of line,you would tell me,right?

269
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,020
You don't have to worry,hilda.

270
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,770
I mean,I've been doing this for a while.

271
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,380
I can handle myself just fine.

272
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,650
All right,I feel better.

273
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,740
'Cause you're so good for him and you're good for us,

274
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,350
and I just--I don't want you to quit.

275
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,120
I promise I'm not gonna quit.

276
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,010
Okay.

277
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,270
Honestly? I don't know what I'd do without her.

278
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,050
I know,dad,she is great.

279
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,260
Elena is wonderful.

280
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,070
And that's why I think it's important that

281
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,120
we treat her with professional and appropriate courtesy.

282
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,960
Betty...what's on your mind?

283
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,780
Nothing.

284
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,670
Let's go to lunch.

285
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,830
connor and molly have trekked the wilds of south asia together,

286
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,970
and I haven't even seen the inside of his apartment.

287
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,440
Well,has he ever invited you?

288
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,750
Of course he has,marc,but he lives in murray hill.

289
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,040
I'm not a barbarian.

290
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,610
willie.

291
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,910
He's seen her rashes.

292
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,190
I mean,my god,aren't some things better kept 
between you and your dermatologist?

293
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:41,320
Personally,I'd like to think that everything 
underneath that is pure,unblemished mocha.

294
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,160
Well,I will not be hiking in some wet,green,

295
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,980
buggy climate where people grow rice.

296
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,400
No way.

297
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,040
That's not who I am.

298
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,120
Willie...

299
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,470
maybe you want to consider opening 
yourself up just a teensy bit to connor.

300
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,830
I don't do intimacy.

301
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,340
Tried it once. It didn't work out.

302
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,540
You don't have to reveal your 
uncomfortable secrets overnight.

303
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,490
This isn't "the bachelor."

304
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,290
but baby steps--

305
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,730
going in to see his apartment,

306
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,170
letting him know that you really care,that you want more.

307
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,170
That was really nice,mija.

308
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,350
- Thank you. 
- Of course,dad.

309
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,590
Where's your bathroom?

310
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,300
Right there.

311
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,350
Oh. Be right back.

312
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,260
Oh! Betty.

313
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,650
Ms. Meade.

314
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:35,690
My friend liz smith tells me that 
you have wanted to ask her some questions about me.

315
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,040
Oh,thank you.

316
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,030
well,I-I meant to tell you--

317
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,210
this is the island of manhattan,betty.

318
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,050
Anything you think is a secret isn'T.

319
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,900
Oh,it's not a secret.

320
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,890
Uh,I'm just doing an assignment for Y.E.T.I.

321
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,570
Uh,a video on someone who 
I admire in publishing,and I chose you.

322
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,640
I'm very flattered.

323
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,910
Was that your father I saw?

324
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,020
Yes,we...just had a very unsuccessful lunch.

325
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,970
What happened?

326
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,520
He did this weird thing,and 
I couldn't bring myself to ask him about it.

327
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,560
What was it?

328
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,190
Really,ms. Meade...it's fine.

329
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,940
I'm no stranger to weird behavior,betty.

330
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,470
Well...we caught him grabbing his nurse's butt.

331
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,210
oh.

332
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,760
Bradford went through the same thing after 
his first heart attack.

333
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,950
He could not keep it in his pants.

334
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,270
Uh,night and day,he would not leave me alone.

335
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,840
finally I had to slip him an extra 
sedative so I could get some sleep.

336
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,260
well,I don't think I could drug my father.

337
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,320
But I did try talking to him,and,that was...

338
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,530
awkward.So...

339
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,960
well,would you like me to talk to him?

340
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,390
Oh,well,I--

341
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,350
hello. Buenos dias,mrs. Meade.

342
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,350
Buenos dias,ignacio.

343
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,010
Oh,I was just aut to get a cup of coffee.
Would you care to join me?

344
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,580
Well,sure.

345
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,230
have fun!

346
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,700
I love it,thank you

347
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,640
well,all set.

348
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,360
I'm meeting tomorrow morning with the saatchi brothers in london.

349
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,360
Great. Separate those bastards from their ad budget.

350
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,950
Godspeed.

351
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,150
Uh,uh,of--of course,I'm gonna miss you.

352
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,230
a lot.

353
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,370
you'd better****

354
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,940
But I'd rather be in bed with you...

355
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,800
sharing feelings.

356
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,630
thank you,marc.

357
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,880
Um,is there anything I can do for you 
while you're away?

358
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,260
Oh,darling,I hate to bother you.

359
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,970
No problem,really,whatever it is.

360
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,930
nice to meet you.

361
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,910
Wilhelmina slater,meet olivia newton bird.

362
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,970
you're kidding,right?

363
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,010
She was a birthday gift 
around the time "grease" came out.

364
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,250
I had the biggest schoolboy crush on ms. Newton-john.

365
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,150
I had no idea.

366
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,730
Well,that's because you've never been around my apartment.

367
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,710
Ah,there they are...

368
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,660
My two best birds.

369
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,550
I'll touch base when I land.

370
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,910
Well,hello there.

371
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,450
Olivia newton bird want a cracker?

372
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,840
pretty molly.

373
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,150
Pretty molly.

374
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,400
Pretty molly.

375
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,040
elena says it's perfectly normal for 
someone who's been through

376
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,610
- what papi has to get a little... 
- Justin,

377
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,040
- come on. Let's go.You're gonna be late for school.  
- frisky.But she can handle it,yeah,yeah,yeah.

378
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,990
and she's not gonna quit?

379
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,220
No. God. Thank god.

380
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,360
How did your talk with papi go?

381
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,260
betty.

382
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,960
I couldn't go through with it.

383
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,480
- What? - Hilda!

384
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,630
But claire meade did.She talked to him.

385
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,500
And she said that it was probably better for him

386
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,530
to talk to someone his own age,anyway...

387
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,060
someone who's not his daughter.

388
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,260
- I can't believe you. You're such a-- 
- good morning.

389
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,130
good morning.

390
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,470
Good morning.

391
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,990
What were you two whispering about?

392
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,750
nothing.

393
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,570
Nothing. I was just,telling hilda 
how we ran into claire meade yesterday,

394
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,600
and the two of you had a lovely chat.

395
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,360
Yes,she's an amazing woman.

396
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,530
Yeah,sure,if you can get past the booze 
and the pills and the murder.

397
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,100
Why a biography has not been written about that woman--

398
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,130
it's criminal.

399
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,250
I'd buy it.

400
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,000
And she told me you two were worried about me.

401
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,490
But I want you to know that everything is fine.

402
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,090
In fact,better than fine.

403
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,180
oh,my goodness.I'm gonna be late.

404
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,330
Papi,I am so glad that everything is okay,
but I have to run.

405
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,400
I'm interviewing some of 
claire meade's friends for her tribute video.

406
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,920
And they were really eager to talk,

407
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,380
so I think it's gonna be great.

408
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,900
So what is claire's best quality?

409
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,270
Wouldn't it be better 
if you turned the camera on?

410
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,170
red button.

411
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,960
Okay.

412
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,950
Uh,what's claire's best quality?

413
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,460
Claire's best quality?

414
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,580
well,she's a fun drunk.

415
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,960
She's fun drunk.

416
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,900
Well,for the first five drinks,that is.

417
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,600
The next five,it's all tears and scenities.

418
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,770
But if you can hang in there till the seventh drink...

419
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,780
till number 11...

420
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,970
well,then it gets to be fun again.

421
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,050
She's a stumbling delight.

422
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,870
tell me something that you admire about claire.

423
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,340
Well,

424
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,540
- Well... - that's a tough one.

425
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,520
Mm. How surprisingly well she managed to round from th...

426
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,000
murder conviction.

427
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,060
Okay,um,what's the most fun 
you've ever had with claire meade?

428
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,950
well...

429
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,960
claire wasn't actually there.

430
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,270
It was when she was on the lam.

431
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,250
See,viveca and i were leaving le bernardin,

432
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:37,460
and we saw a woman who looked exactly 
like claire eating out of a garbe caN.

433
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,330
oh,we laughed.

434
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,910
it was priceless.

435
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,680
Honey,are we done?

436
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,870
thank you.

437
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,640
Oh,hey,betty,how's the claire with project going?

438
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,550
oh,those women were horrible.

439
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,270
Claire meade has no friends.

440
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,850
This tribute video's gonna be really sad.

441
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,910
Here. Shoot me. I'll give claire a little birthday greeting.

442
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,260
Really?

443
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,740
and... action.

444
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,790
Happy birthday,mrs. Meade.

445
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,910
You killed my mother.

446
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,880
Not helping.

447
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,430
Pretty molly.

448
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,190
you sound like an idiot.

449
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,460
See,marc,this is what happens 
when you put yourself out there.

450
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,810
Well,you could have watered his plants.

451
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,650
You didn't have to offer to bird sit.

452
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,150
Well,I guess people in love do stupid things.

453
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,180
did you just say the "l" word?

454
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,740
Oh,willie...

455
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,370
have you told connor yet?

456
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,080
Has that bird crap rotted your brain?

457
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,180
Of course not.

458
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,110
Well,why not,if it's how you feel?

459
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,210
Have I taught you nothing about power?

460
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,010
I can't say it first.

461
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,730
It's like when you call bill clinton.

462
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,790
You put him on hold,and then you get me on the line.

463
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,770
I don't think it's the same thing.

464
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:57,610
Until he makes the first move,no one outside this office will er hear me say,

465
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,150
"I love connor.

466
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,960
" I love connor.

467
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,270
did that just say...

468
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,670
I love connor.

469
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,110
I didn't hear anything.

470
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,970
I love connor.

471
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,880
I love connor.

472
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,080
New york's best-kept secret.

473
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,890
I know how much you like tibetan food,so...

474
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,780
the pride of little tibet.

475
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,850
You remembered.

476
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,140
That is so sweet.Thank you.

477
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,330
Surprised?

478
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,960
Yes,I am.

479
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,070
But there's something you should know.

480
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,620
Miss molly,welcome back!

481
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,640
Hi,sam.

482
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,800
I've kind of been here before.

483
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,900
You're not mr.Connor.

484
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,930
No,I'm not.

485
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,290
Where's mr.Connor?

486
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:55,290
Uh,we don't know where mr.Connor is,sam,but you have me

487
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,440
-- mr.Niel.

488
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,820
Mr.Connor's not sick,is he?

489
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,710
No,I don't know.

490
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,030
Look,it doesn't-- 

491
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,100
I'm sorry.I didn't mean to snap.

492
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,610
Uh,w-would you show us to our table,please?

493
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,000
Absolutely.

494
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,340
daniel.

495
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,230
These women are supposed to be claire meade's friends,

496
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,030
but they're like vultures,fur-wearing vultures.

497
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,800
Can we see the tape?

498
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,140
No.

499
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,820
Papi!Dinner!

500
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,700
Now I don't know what I'm gonna do.

501
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,740
I mean,I guess I could always interview ms.Meade.

502
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,860
So she'll be doing a tribute video...

503
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,260
to herself?

504
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,470
Don't stress me out.I don't know what else I can do.

505
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,580
Isn't there,like,home videos you could use or something?

506
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,380
you should see the home videos.

507
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,460
I saw claire meade fall into a christmas tree.

508
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,200
And apparently,there's a 4th of july barbecue-in-the-pool spectacular.

509
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,030
Ooh,you remember that 4th of july where we got the inflatable pool

510
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,240
and papi couldn't get the chemicals right?

511
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,810
Oh,and mami's hair turned green.

512
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,260
She was so mad at papi.

513
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,390
I know.I remember that green hair.

514
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,610
I think that is why I became a beautician.

515
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,470
Papi,dinner!

516
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,040
He's still upstairs with elena doing his physical therapy.

517
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,420
Elena's still here?

518
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,190
I thought she would' been gone hours ago.

519
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:28,440
No,papi asked her to stay for dinner,so can you go get them?

520
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Thank you.

521
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,030
oh,my god.

522
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,930
Betty.

523
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,390
are you two...

524
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,270
together.

525
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,150
Mijas,I knew this would be awkward.***********

526
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,150
*****************

527
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,520
********

528
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,910
I needed to come clean about it.

529
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,860
Elena and I were gonna tell you after dinner.

530
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,060
Wait.

531
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,950
So mrs.Meade said that this was a good idea?

532
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,670
Yes.

533
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,890
She's a very smart woman.

534
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,960
Hey,I askedou if there was something weird going on with my father,

535
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,560
and you lied to my face.

536
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,680
-Hilda-- 
-no,that's not her fault.

537
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,510
I ked her not to say anything.

538
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,820
Papi,comen,this is crazy.

539
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,350
She's your nurse.

540
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,850
You're recovering from open-heart surgery.

541
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,620
You're not in a place to think clearly.

542
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,220
And you-- you came into our house to take care of our sick father.

543
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,710
He's your patient.

544
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,850
-Okay,hilda,just listen to me-- 
-no,no,no,this is so inappropriate.

545
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,940
What is wrong with you?

546
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,260
That's enough.

547
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,160
Okay,maybe I should leave.

548
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,880
No,no,no.

549
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,400
No,it would be better if you left.

550
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,510
That is not up to you.

551
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,440
Hey,yeah,it is.

552
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,240
We are the only ones making sense here.

553
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,490
Y qu?sabes t?de making sense!

554
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,530
Papi,please.You should calm down.

555
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,050
I'm sorry,I can't do this.I can't do this.

556
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,100
-Elena.
-No,please.

557
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,150
dad,please...

558
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,040
don't be angry with us.

559
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,590
Listen to me.

560
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,700
I know I haven't dated since your mom.

561
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,600
I know it can't be easy for you.

562
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,310
But there is no way ena would ever...

563
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,260
-replace your-- 
-stop.

564
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,320
Don't say her name in the same sentence as mom.

565
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,260
-Betty-- 
-no.

566
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,390
You can't date elena.

567
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,130
You know what?

568
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,810
This isn't about me.

569
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,710
It's about you two.

570
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,500
compliments of the chef.

571
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,020
Thank you.

572
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,660
Let me guess.

573
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,990
A mr.Connor favorite?

574
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,160
Actually,it's for me.

575
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,500
I'm into the weirder stuff.

576
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,800
Connor stuck to the noodles.

577
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,720
Really?

578
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,450
Oh,connor can keep his noodles,'cause I am all about the adventure.

579
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,870
So,um...

580
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,680
what is this?

581
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,740
It'S...

582
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,330
it's blood sausage.

583
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,150
Sure can taste the,um...

584
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,090
blood.

585
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,540
are you ready to order?

586
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,810
I'm still deciding.

587
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:46,670
You go.

588
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,610
You kn what?How about,uh...

589
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,870
uh,I-I'll get this.

590
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,130
One brled yak tongue.

591
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,970
uh,you know what?

592
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:57,380
Uh,actually,I'll just,uh...I'll get the number...

593
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,380
uh,46.

594
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,190
Don't tell me what it is,though.

595
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,100
Ah,yes,bean thread noodles.

596
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,150
Mr.Connor's special.

597
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:14,110
could you...please give us another minute or two?

598
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,130
are you okay?

599
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,330
Yeah,no,fine.

600
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,670
It's just...

601
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,410
it's connor,you know?I...

602
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,510
it just...

603
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,260
it makes me feel...

604
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,110
makes you feel what?

605
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:38,580
Uh,t-- sort of weird.

606
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,910
What are we drinking?

607
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,770
Fermented yak butter tea...

608
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,350
tibetan delicacy.

609
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,130
Why?

610
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,470
Daniel,daniel.

611
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:04,390
I can't believe your class would be interested in a day in the life of claire meade.

612
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:08,780
Well,why no you are a big part of meade publications.

613
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:13,890
So tell me,how are things at "hot flash"?

614
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:16,070
oh,I'm starting an advice column.

615
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,780
Advice.

616
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,160
How...

617
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,700
-interesting.
-I hope so.

618
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:27,030
I'm thinking about calling it "claire cares" or "i claire about you.

619
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,270
" I'm sorry.

620
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,600
I have something I have to ask you.

621
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,890
Um,did you tell my father it was okay to sleep with his nurse?

622
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,260
-Betty-- 
-I thought you were gonna talk some sense into him.

623
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,380
I'm just a little surprised that you encouraged him to...

624
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,060
get busy.

625
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,010
He found someone he liS.

626
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,350
I told him to follow his heart.

627
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,420
But she is way too young for him.

628
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,210
And he just had heart surgery.

629
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,950
He's not ready for something like this.

630
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,610
He's not ready...

631
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,430
or you're not ready?

632
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,820
Ms.Meade.Did you just take something?

633
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,190
Maybe.So what?

634
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,440
What?Wh--so what?That's stealing.

635
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,090
Keep your voice down,betty,and keep moving.

636
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,830
Well-- let's be done for the day.

637
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,990
I think I saw a gyro cart on the corner.My treat.

638
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,590
mrs.Meade,give it to me.

639
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,220
Um,where are you going with that?

640
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,150
Well,uh...

641
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,880
I was just going outside.I-- 

642
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,070
that's what you think.Let's go.

643
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,660
Come on.

644
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:39,080
Ot of nerveor a lot of confidence,lady.

645
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,870
Look,did not do this.

646
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,810
I'm not trying to implicate anyone else,I'm just saying,

647
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:51,630
I have never,ever stolen anything...in my entire life.

648
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,160
Betty.

649
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,540
Ms.Meade.I am so sorry.

650
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,710
This young woman didn't steal anything.

651
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,690
I did.She tried to stop me.

652
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,050
You know what?I think I'll let the cops sort this out.

653
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,320
The cops?

654
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,010
I don't understand why you're doing this.

655
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,930
what are you gonna do if the press finds out?

656
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,270
Oh,please,betty.

657
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,670
Nobody pays any attention to me.

658
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,300
That is not true.

659
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,450
Getting older is very strange,betty.

660
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:32,080
You marry,you have children,everybody depends on you,and then one day you wake up,and...

661
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,730
you're invisible.

662
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:35,960
You are not invisible.

663
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,660
You have your family.

664
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:43,890
No,bradford's gone,alexis and D.J.Are in france,daniel has molly.

665
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,400
I'm alone.

666
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:54,530
Today's my birthday,which you are aware of,since thisite video presentation

667
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:59,650
is obviously part of the surprise party that daniel is having for me.

668
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,780
You knew?

669
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,410
Oh,betty.

670
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:05,070
You are so good at so many things.

671
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,170
Subtlety isn't one of them.

672
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:13,360
Daniel just really wanted to do something special for you.

673
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,910
You know what I wish he'd do?

674
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:21,610
I wish he would give me just a little time alone with him.

675
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,060
Be careful with your father,betty.

676
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,460
You and your sister aren't going to live with him forever.

677
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,950
And if he can find someone to share his later years with,

678
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:37,990
it won't hurt quite so much when you can't meet him for dinner.

679
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,200
We checked the security tape.

680
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,950
you're free to go.

681
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,190
-oh,good.
-You're not.

682
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,810
Mrs.Meade,you need to come with me.

683
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,510
What?

684
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,750
It--it's okay,betty.

685
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,090
I'll be fine.

686
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,020
How you feeling?

687
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,430
Oh,god.Those better not be leftovers.

688
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,050
Yak tongue always tastes good the next day.

689
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,870
It's like pizza.

690
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,040
no.I brought you some supplies.

691
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,180
Club soda,medicine.

692
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,250
I'm so sorry about last night.

693
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,940
Worst date ever.

694
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,130
No.

695
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,040
I threw up on a buddha statue.

696
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,070
So you come back as a rat.

697
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,860
I really wanted it to be special...

698
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,670
you know,something we could remember as "our night.

699
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,260
" You and connor have so much history together.

700
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:44,310
Daniel,you and I will have our own history.

701
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,670
I've never had a relationship that's lasted than six months 

702
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,150
I'm afraid of screwing this up.

703
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,500
Well,I won't let you.

704
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:02,180
And for the record,last night may not have been perfect,but it was memorable.

705
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,950
I'm sorry.

706
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,480
betty.

707
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,780
Yeah,what's going on?

708
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,520
Hi,mom.

709
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,980
Oh,god.Daniel.

710
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,460
I was expecting the police.

711
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,710
Yeah.Betty called.

712
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:36,320
I had our lawyer smooth things over,so...

713
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,470
you're free to go.

714
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,480
I've been a bit of a mess.

715
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,480
I'm sorry.

716
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,220
No.I'm sorry.

717
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,270
I haven't been a very good son recently.

718
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,310
I guess we should get going.

719
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,070
I don't want to be late for my party.

720
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,850
you know about that?

721
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:14,550
I was almost relieved to spend the night in jail rather than with those piranhas I call my friends.

722
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,860
But what the hell.

723
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,540
I'll make the best of it.

724
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,860
I love prada.

725
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,310
I love connor.

726
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,260
I love gucci.

727
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,800
I love oscar de la renta fall 2009.

728
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,610
keep it simple,mary.

729
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,390
forget it.

730
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,570
Just throw it out the window.

731
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,860
I love connor.

732
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,230
But...

733
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,240
that's bird-er.

734
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,020
Oh,the little monster has wings.

735
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,940
Let it fly south and torment some poor family in staten island.

736
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,230
you'd throw your boyfriend's beloved pet out the window so he doesn't find out you love him?

737
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,240
Yes.

738
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,000
May I say something,friend tfriend?

739
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,980
No.

740
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,810
-Man to woman?
-Oh,god.No

741
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,090
-Employee to employer?
-What is it,marc?

742
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:13,570
Waiting for someone else to say "I love you" first doesn't mean you're more powerful.

743
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,730
It just means you're afraid.

744
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,860
Hi.

745
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,520
Sorry.

746
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,150
I-I hope you don't mind.

747
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,030
I-I just needed to talk to you.

748
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:46,140
Something you forgot to accuse me of last night?

749
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,120
No.I just want to say I'm sorry.

750
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,470
Look,this...

751
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:55,560
thing with you and my father,it just took us by surprise.

752
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,720
Me,too.

753
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,820
ten years I've been a nurse.

754
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,210
Not once in my life have I ever felt this way about one of my patients.

755
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,240
Now hilda thinks I'm some kind of predator.

756
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,820
No,she doesn'T.

757
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,950
Maybe a little.

758
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,090
But we're just worried about our father...

759
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,520
and his heart.

760
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,160
Romance is good for your heart.

761
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,200
What do you think,we were swinging from the chandeliers?

762
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,540
No!God.No.

763
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,590
Well,I wasn'T.

764
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,950
Betty,I wasn't looking for this to happen.

765
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,080
Believe me.

766
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,520
But your father's a good man.

767
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,510
He's kind,smart...

768
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,150
a great cook.

769
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,220
And he's good for my heart,too.

770
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:14,900
um,we're gonna be five tonight.

771
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,760
**********

772
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,750
Hilda,it might not feel good,but...

773
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,410
we don't have the right to stop papi from being with elena.

774
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:39,260
Yes,we do,because it's wrong.

775
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:44,310
Or maybe it's just hard for us to see him with another woman.

776
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,860
hilda...

777
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,130
mom is gone.

778
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:55,090
That doesn't mean that papi has to spend the rest of his life alone.

779
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,010
I know.I don't-- 

780
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,650
I don't want that,either.It's just...

781
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,370
it's hard enough to keep mami's memory alive.

782
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,380
And I feel...

783
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,010
like she's disappearing.

784
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,450
It's just...

785
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,630
I know.

786
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,450
Look...

787
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:22,830
no matter what happens with elena,your mom will never disappear.

788
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,420
Papi,I'm sorry.

789
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:32,330
This was more about us than it was about you.

790
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,330
It's okay,mija.

791
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:36,530
I know it's complicated.

792
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,790
guess what.

793
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,150
Elena knows kiefer sutherland.

794
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,500
I don't know him.

795
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,800
I gave him a b12 shot once.

796
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,800
He cried like a girl.

797
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,290
this is going straight to the message boards.

798
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,780
Anonymously,of course.

799
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,510
Well,I guess I'll get another plate.

800
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,750
Can I help with anything?

801
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,680
No,I got it.

802
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,310
Don't worry.

803
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,970
She'll come around.

804
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:10,770
Come on.

805
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,880
how was london?

806
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,570
I closed the deal.

807
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,620
Of course you did.

808
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,660
oh,I missed you.

809
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,420
Oh,I missed you,too.

810
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,540
How's olivia newton bird?

811
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,200
sleeping.

812
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,820
I hope she didn't drive you too crazy.

813
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,400
Connor,I love you.

814
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,560
Uh,I-I don't know what you feel,but...

815
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,530
I-I needed to tell you,be-- mm.

816
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,310
I love you,too.

817
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,050
I love connor.

818
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,670
I love connor.

819
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,700
Daniel,if we do this,we are going to be late for my surprise party.

820
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,830
I just have to pick something up in my office.

821
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,220
It won't take a minute.

822
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,220
what's this?

823
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,730
Surprise.

824
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,350
I thought it'd be nicer if you and I just had a little dinner together...

825
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,360
alone.

826
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,940
Happy birthday,mom.

827
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,090
thank you.

828
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,420
Shall we?

829
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:57,940
* from behind these walls I hear your song *

830
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,000

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,920
