00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,460
<i>Your One And Only Source
Into The Scandalous Lives</i>

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,780
<i>Of Manhattan's Elite. I Remember
The First Time I Ever Saw Him.</i>

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,020
I Knew. He's The One I Wanna Marry.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,630
I Think You Dropped
This At The Ball.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,830
I Hate Secrets More Than Anything.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,810
You're Dismissed, Jenny... For Good.
Something About Uh, Uh, Mom And A Neighbor?

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,640
Yeah, It's... Complicated. Mom's Having
An Affair. It's Easy For Me To Say It.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,170
Mom, It's Time For
You To Come Home.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,210
I Was With My Friend Vanessa.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,540
We're Very Close, And She
Moved Away To Vermont Last Year,

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,640
And Now She's Back.
You Said You Love Me.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,250
Dan, Hungry?

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello. Hi.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,800
Hi. Nathaniel, I'm Shocked.

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,100
I Thought You Were Strictly An
Herbal Man. The Drugs Were Dad's.

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,890
I Mean, I Guess He Thought
It Would Be Easier On Everyone

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,150
If I Took The Hit. I Have To Say,
Every Time I Look At Anne's Finger

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,510
And See Blair's Future
Engagement Ring... Ah.

19
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,100
I Can Hardly Contain My Joy. It Seems
Your Father Is Facing Some Other Charges.

20
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,040
For What? Embezzlement And Fraud.

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,470
You Should Deal With Your Father.

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,330
He Needs You. I
Don't. Where's Nate?

23
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,980
I Think We Just Broke Up. What?

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,930
I Don't Wanna Talk About
It. I Just Want To Escape.

25
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,090
That's What This
Place Is For, Right?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And Who Am I?</i>

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That's A Secret I'll Never Tell.</i>

28
00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:00,034
<i>You Know You Love Me.</i>

29
00:00:00,052 --> 00:00:00,069
<i>X.O.X.O., Gossip Girl.</i>

30
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,050
<i>According To The Catholic Church,</i>

31
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,470
<i>Mortal Sin Can Only Be Absolved</i>

32
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,240
<i>Through The Sacred
Act Of Confession,</i>

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,680
<i>But It Looks Like A
Certain W.A.S.P. Princess</i>

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,200
<i>Has Recently Found Herself</i>

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,710
<i>Desperately In Need Of
A Little Unburdening.</i>

36
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,200
<i>And Who Is The Man
Upstairs To Discriminate?</i>

37
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,640
Forgive Me, Father,
For I Have Sinned.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,210
It's Been...

39
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,290
A While Since My Last Confession.

40
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,780
What Troubles You, My Child?

41
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,430
After Being Broken
Up With My Boyfriend

42
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,010
For Exactly 20 Minutes, I...

43
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,850
Succumbed To Inebriation,

44
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,520
Performed At A Speakeasy

45
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,730
And Surrendered My Virtue
To A Self-Absorbed Ass.

46
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,490
The Only Good News Is
That He's A Total Pig

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,200
Who Will Act Like It Never
Happened. Thank God. Ahem.

48
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,310
Sorry. Truthfully, I'm Not
Even Catholic. You Don't Say.

49
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,570
But Losing My
Virginity To Chuck Bass?

50
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,640
None Of My Friends
Will Ever Understand.

51
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,770
I'm Ready For My Punishment.

52
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,990
Whatever You And
God Think Is Fair-

53
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,760
Flogging, Fasting,

54
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,970
Putting That Thing With
The Teeth Around My Thigh,

55
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:44,770
Like Silas.

56
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,970
How About Some Food
For Thought Instead?

57
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,080
Don't Drink.

58
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,050
Keep Your Clothes On.

59
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,820
Try Avoiding Those Who
Might Cause You To Stray.

60
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,790
Oh, I Plan To.

61
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,470
Thank You, Father. It
Was Very Good Advice.

62
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,610
You Don't Grant
Birthday Wishes, Do You?

63
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,860
I'm A Priest, Not A Genie.

64
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,960
<i>Well, The Next Time
You Talk To Him,</i>

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,960
Would You Ask Him To Send
My Boyfriend Back To Me?

66
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,850
Mm. I Gotta Say...

67
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,630
No Need To Say Anything.

68
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,550
God, I Hate People In Love.

69
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,900
Wow.

70
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,690
Awkward.

71
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,040
Vanessa?

72
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,020
<i>Serena. Dan.</i>

73
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,990
<i>No, No, No, No, No,
No. Vanessa's Here.</i>

74
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,140
Ah. Lovebirds Ready To Order?

75
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,420
Oh, I'll Take 'Em. Hi.

76
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,500
Hi. So, Uh, You-You Work Here Now?

77
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,170
I Did Mention That, But
You've Been Distracted.

78
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,340
Vanessa. Hi. Nice To See You.
This Time You're Seeing Less Of Me.

79
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,990
Sorry About That. Walking In
When You Were, You Know... Yeah.

80
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,840
So You Guys Are Up Early.
What'd You Do Last Night?

81
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,360
Oh, My God. I Totally
Didn't Mean To Pry.

82
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,030
You're Not Prying. Why Would
You Think You're Prying?

83
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,110
No Reason. Did You Tell Her?

84
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,820
What? No. What's To
Tell? I Know Nothing,

85
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,930
But If You Guys Did The
Thing I Know Nothing About,

86
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,500
Then I Would Totally Support
That. Thanks, Vanessa.

87
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,870
Good To Know In The
Event That Should Happen.

88
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,900
Oh, Meaning It Didn't Happen? Meaning I Don't
Even Know What We're Talking About Right Now.

89
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,920
<i>I Know I'm Lost. And
I Should Get Lost.</i>

90
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,610
First Day. I Have Lots Of Tables.

91
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,200
Clearly.

92
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,630
So Vanessa Works Here Now.

93
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,150
Yeah, We Should Make
This Our Regular Spot.

94
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,130
Well, This Is The Last
Place I'd Expect To Find You.

95
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,770
Go Away, Chuck. I've
Been Given Orders

96
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,890
Practically From God Himself To Avoid You.
Would You Consider Avoiding Me Over Breakfast?

97
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,980
Sorry, But As Is Tradition
On The Day Before My Birthday,

98
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,280
I'm Heading To The Jeweler's
To Put Some Pieces On Hold

99
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,600
For Eleanor And
- Nate? Oh, I Don't Think

100
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,830
He'll Be Singing "Happy
Birthday" This Year.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,600
No One Knows That
Nate And I Broke Up,

102
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,940
And It's Gonna Stay That
Way So I Can Fix This,

103
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:31,850
And I Don't Think Your Best Friend

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,430
Would Still Be Your Best Friend If He Knew
- If He Knew How Much I Enjoyed The Removal

105
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,730
Of A Certain Chastity Belt In The Back Of
This Very Limo? From This Moment Forward,

106
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,700
The Events Of Last Night
Will Never Be Mentioned Again.

107
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,910
Is That Clear? Not As Clear As The
Memory Of You Purring In My Ear,

108
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,630
Which I Have Been Replaying Over
And Over. Well, Erase The Tape,

109
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,600
Because As Far As I'm
Concerned, It Never Happened.

110
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,460
I'll See You At Your Party Tonight.
You're Officially Uninvited.

111
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,270
Never Stopped Me Before.

112
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,260
<i>Speak Of The Devil,</i>

113
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,860
<i>And He Doth Appear,
Wearing His Trademark Scarf.</i>

114
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,060
<i>Careful, B.</i>

115
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,160
<i>Hell Hath No Fury Like
A Chuck Bass Scorned.</i>

116
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,950
Hey, Dad.

117
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,300
Hi, Honey. How Was Hudson?

118
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,320
Your Mother Must Have Been
Kind Of Surprised To See You.

119
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,530
Yeah, She Was.

120
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,900
Hi, Rufus.

121
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,370
Alison.

122
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,160
What Are You Doing Here?
Well, I Asked Her To Come.

123
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,340
You Know, I Thought
You Guys Could... Talk.

124
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,930
Ahem.

125
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,350
Or Not.

126
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,570
Okay, Dad, I Know
It Wasn't My Place

127
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,680
To Ask Mom To Come Back... Jenny.

128
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,020
It's Your Life. I Get
That, But It's My Life, Too,

129
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,060
And It's Dan's, And I Just Felt
That Nothing's Ever Gonna Change

130
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:55,210
If Someone Doesn't Do Something.
Jenny! Stop. Breathe. I'm Not Angry.

131
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,200
You're Not?

132
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,810
Not At You.

133
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,540
While You Can't
Get Un-Angry At Mom

134
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,140
If She's In Hudson,
And You're Here, Dad.

135
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,510
I Mean, Nothing's Ever Gonna Change

136
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,770
If You're Not In The Same Room.

137
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,870
Can't You Just Give It A Chance?

138
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,910
Not On An Empty Stomach.

139
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,280
Come. I'll Make Us Breakfast.

140
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,460
Who Wants Waffles?

141
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,100
I Mean, You Do Still Like
Waffles, Right, Rufus?

142
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,530
You Know Me, Al.

143
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,020
I'm A Loyal Guy. Once I Commit
To Something, I Stick With It.

144
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,730
Ahem.

145
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,730
I'll Get The Syrup.

146
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,030
Hey, Mom. I Just Got
Back From The Jeweler's,

147
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,210
And I Have To Say
- Have You Seen This?

148
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,970
Since When Does
Drunk And Disorderly

149
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,250
Get This Much
Attention? Since Never.

150
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,090
The Captain Is Being Charged
With Embezzlement And Fraud.

151
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,540
This Is An Absolute Disaster.
It Must Be Awful For Them.

152
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,260
<i>I Meant For Me. The Captain
Is Supposed To Represent Me.</i>

153
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,240
The Contracts Are
About To Be Signed.

154
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,140
What About My I.P.O., Huh?

155
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,310
What Is Gonna Happen To My Bendel's
Deal? Nate Looks So Helpless.

156
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,640
I Have To Call My Attorney.
I-I Have To Put An End

157
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,570
To This Deal Before
It Goes Any Further.

158
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,830
I Have To Talk To Nate.

159
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,150
I Don't Know Why

160
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,930
Everybody's Making Such
A Big Deal Out Of This.

161
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,680
It's Just A Misunderstanding.
It'll Be Cleared Up In Time.

162
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,800
Yes, It Will, At Your
Trial. This Is Real, Howard.

163
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,630
The Only Reason You're
Not Behind Bars Right Now

164
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,160
Is Because Your Wife Could Afford Your Bail.
And I Would've Paid Ten Times That Amount.

165
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,400
You're Not Going To Jail. And
We're Gonna Do Everything We Can

166
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,590
To Make Sure That Doesn't Happen,

167
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,830
But In The Meantime, This Is Not
Something To Be Cavalier About.

168
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,080
It's Clearly A Setup. Someone's Got A Agenda.
Dad, Would You Just Shut Up And Listen To Him?

169
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,850
Nate. Look, Sir, What
Exactly Do We Need To Do Here?

170
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,570
Remain Calm And Give Them
Nothing But A United Front

171
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,090
As We Fight This. Well,
What About Some Sort Of, Um,

172
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,230
Some Sort Of Plea?

173
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,490
A Plea? You Think I'm Guilty?

174
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,900
Dad, It's Just A Question.

175
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,250
How Would That Work Exactly?

176
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,510
It Wouldn't. Nate, I'm
Sure You're Very Tired,

177
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,500
And This Is A
Conversation For Adults.

178
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,070
Why Don't You Go Get
Some Rest, Sweetheart?

179
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,290
Hey, Dad.

180
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,690
Jenny.

181
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,350
And-And Mom.

182
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,780
Hi, Honey.

183
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,050
Well, Look At This. The
Whole Family's Together...

184
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,440
Eating Waffles.

185
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,470
Want One?

186
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,030
You Bet.

187
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,930
Just One Question.

188
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,090
Am I The Only One Who Thinks
This Is Extremely Weird?

189
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,300
I
- I Mean, Given Everything.

190
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,440
Dan, Just Forget About It.

191
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,440
If Dad Can Let It Go, So Can
You. What Do You Mean, Let It Go?

192
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,330
You Know, The Guy In
Hudson. You Told Her?

193
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,770
No, Of Course I Didn't Tell
Her. Rufus. I Would Never.

194
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,760
I Overheard Dan And Dad Talking.
He Heard Us Arguing On The Phone.

195
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,070
Yeah, If You Want To Keep
Secrets, Maybe We Should All

196
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,390
Abandon The Loft And Move
To A Place With More Walls.

197
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,250
It's Always Gogood
To Give Him A While.

198
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,310
Yeah, No, I Knew-I Knew That.

199
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,040
I Can't Believe He Told Her
You Guys Were Gonna Do It.

200
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,340
Well, I Told You. That's
Different. I'm A Girl.

201
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,520
Yeah, Well, So Is She. Exactly
My Point. But Even If She Wasn't,

202
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,770
When You Get A Boyfriend,
You Become The Best Friend,

203
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,220
And The Best Friend Becomes
The Second Best Friend.

204
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,830
That's Just How It Has To
Be If It's Ever Gonna Work.

205
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,230
Hey, You Still Haven't
Told Me How Nate's Doing.

206
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,880
It's All Over The News.

207
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,510
Uh, When I Talked
To Him This Morning,

208
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,900
I
- I Told Him To Focus On His Family Today.

209
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,500
But He's Still Coming To
Your Party, Right? Here.

210
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,220
Uh, I Told Him Not
To Worry About It.

211
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,790
I Mean, Only If He's Up To It.

212
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,020
You're Such A Good
Girlfriend, B., Really.

213
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,650
Hey, Um, I'll Just Pick You
Up, And We Can Go Together,

214
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,300
But I Really Hope Nate Can Make It.

215
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,350
<i>* We'll Walk Around * Nate, Here You
Are. I've Been Looking Everywhere For You.</i>

216
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,620
I Was Up In Your Room.

217
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,340
I Was Calling Your
Name For 20 Minutes.

218
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,590
Hey, Take Your Earphones Out.

219
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,490
Take Your Earphones Out.

220
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,070
Nathaniel, I've Been
Calling You For 20 Minutes.

221
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,840
I'm Sorry. What Is It?

222
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,730
Blair's Birthday Party
Is Tonight, Isn't It?

223
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,260
Yeah.

224
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,690
I Was Thinking Maybe You Should
Give Her Something Special.

225
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,880
I'm Sure She's Already
Picked Out Something

226
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,020
At The Jewelry Store
And Put It On Hold.

227
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,680
Something More Special Than That.

228
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,250
Mom, That's A Family Heirloom.

229
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,350
I'm Not Giving It To Blair.

230
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,860
It's An Engagement Ring.

231
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,530
I'm Not Asking You To
Propose, But It's Important

232
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,050
That Blair Knows How Much
You Value Her Loyalty.

233
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,290
Her Loyalty Or Her Mother's?
Eleanor's Lawyers May Have Called.

234
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,130
What Difference Does It Make?

235
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,440
One Day We'll All Be Family,

236
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,760
And They Won't Have A Choice In These
Matters. Blair And I Broke Up Last Night.

237
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,350
Well, Then Get Back Together.

238
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,750
I Don't Think So. May I Remind
You It Was Your Own Rash Actions

239
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,300
That Got Us Into This Predicament?

240
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,510
We're In This Predicament
Because Dad Has A Drug Problem.

241
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,390
I Was Trying To Help
Him Then Help Him.

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,440
Your Father's Acting The Way
That He Is Because He's Scared.

243
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,060
He Needs You So Much Right Now,

244
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,300
More Than He Ever Has.

245
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,450
We All Do.

246
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,360
<i>Whoever Thought Monarchy Was Dead</i>

247
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,690
<i>Didn't Realize It
Just Changed Zip Codes.</i>

248
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,150
<i>So What Will It Be, Nate,</i>

249
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,950
<i>Blair Waldorf's Hand
Or Your Father's Head?</i>

250
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,090
Hi. Are You Okay?

251
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,520
Uh, I've Been Texting You All Day.

252
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,900
Yeah, I'm-I'm Fine. Thanks.
I, Um, Just Been A Little Busy.

253
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,730
I Just Wanted To Check On
You, See If You Need Anything.

254
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,700
Yeah, I Kinda Do.

255
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,690
Oh?

256
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,310
Um... Blair, Do You
Think We've Been A Little-

257
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,880
A Little Hasty With
The Whole Breakup?

258
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,180
I
- I Don't Know, Nate.

259
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,350
Um, It Was A Pretty
Difficult Decision.

260
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,010
Yeah, Look, I-I
Totally Understand.

261
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,690
I'm Sorry. I, Um, I
Shouldn't Have Brought It Up.

262
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,880
Uh, But We Do Have A
Lot Of History Together,

263
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,790
And, Uh, It Was In
The Heat Of The Moment,

264
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,380
But You'd Have To Be Willing
To Really Work For It.

265
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,620
Yeah, Yeah, Of Course.

266
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,930
Listen, We'll Just Take It
Slow And See How It Goes.

267
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,350
And, Um,

268
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,720
I've Got A Birthday
Present For You.

269
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,910
It's, Uh, Something Special.

270
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,610
I Can't Wait To
Open It At My Party.

271
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,130
I'll See You There.

272
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,810
I...

273
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,570
Hi. This Is Blair Waldorf.

274
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,060
I Was Wondering If Any Of
The Pieces That I Put On Hold

275
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,230
Were Picked Up Today.

276
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,030
The Diamond Necklace? Really?

277
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,240
Okay.

278
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,590
Thank You.

279
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,300
Thank You!

280
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,210
Thank You.

281
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,770
Thank You.

282
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,980
Hey.

283
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,060
Can We Talk?

284
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,620
Well, That Depends. Are
You-Are You Back For Good?

285
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,530
I Don't Know.

286
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,210
Your Father And I Haven't Really
Had A Chance To Talk, So...

287
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,500
<i>Well, Do You Want To Come Back,</i>

288
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,110
Or Do You Wanna Live In
Hudson With, Uh, Neighbor Guy?

289
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,850
Okay, Look, Dan, I Understand
That You're Mad, All Right?

290
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,640
And I'm Not Gonna
Defend What I Did.

291
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,360
No, You-You Don't Get It, Do You?

292
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,390
You Think I'm Only
Mad About The Cheating?

293
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,320
Okay. What Else?

294
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,180
Maybe That You Promised

295
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,550
You Would Be Home
By The End Of Summer,

296
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,340
And Then You Weren't.

297
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,250
Maybe The Fact That
You Left At All.

298
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,540
I Asked If You Were Okay With
Me Going Away, And I'd Hoped

299
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,670
That If There Was A Problem,
You Would Say Something.

300
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,790
Like What? "Your Daughter's
A Freshman At A School

301
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,960
"Populated By Mean
Girls And Date Rapists?

302
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,670
I Think She Needs Her Mom. "

303
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,590
Or Maybe "My Father Is
Madly In Love With You

304
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,730
And Will Probably
Never Get Over This"?

305
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,270
Why Should I Have To Tell You This?

306
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,620
Where Are You Going?

307
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,910
Out. I'll Call Later.

308
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,490
Well, That Went Well.

309
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,090
You Know, I Was Thinking
Of Going Out Also.

310
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,980
There's Something I Kinda Need To
Do. Oh, Yeah. You Need Some Help?

311
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,230
Can I Help You? No,
I'm Good. Thanks.

312
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:19,800
Come On, Man.

313
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,850
I Can Hear You Breathing On
The Other Side Of The Door.

314
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,540
Is She Anybody You Can Get Rid Of?

315
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,950
I Just Really Need To
Talk To You, Man. Please.

316
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,660
Nathaniel.

317
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,080
Where's The Girl?

318
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,700
In My Dreams. I Was Trying
To Get Some Shut-Eye.

319
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,460
What's On Your Mind? It's My Mom.

320
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,730
Sounds Freudian.

321
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,250
She Wants Me To
Give Blair Her Ring.

322
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,660
What? You Guys Broke Up.

323
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:50,640
Yeah, I Know. I Mean,
Uh, Wait. How Do You Know?

324
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,270
Predictably, Your Ex

325
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,830
Ran The Old, Uh,
Grill-The-Best-Friend Play.

326
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,950
Tried To Find Out
Where Your Head Was At.

327
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,410
So, Uh, Where, Uh,
Where Is Your Head?

328
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,720
Spinning.

329
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,590
I Mean, My Mom Wants Me
To Get Back With Blair

330
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,710
So Eleanor Doesn't Pull
Out Of Their Business Deal.

331
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,550
It's All Because Of My Dad's
Whole Trial Thing, You Know?

332
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,780
Yeah. I'm Sorry About All That,

333
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,810
But Look, If You're
Done With Blair, Be Done.

334
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,340
Don't Cave To Your Parents' Wishes

335
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,900
If They're Not Your Desires.

336
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,890
Excuse Me? Where's My Boy?

337
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,990
"Seal The Deal. Tap That Ass.
Money Marries Bigger Money"?

338
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,740
Look, I Care About
Three Things, Nathaniel-

339
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,340
Money, The Pleasures
Money Brings Me And You.

340
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,950
I'm Just Trying To
Have Your Back Here.

341
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,480
Your Parents Have Been
Controlling You Your Whole Life.

342
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,310
If It Doesn't End
Now, When Will It Ever?

343
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,630
Oh, My God.

344
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,950
Hey, Guys!

345
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,350
Hey, Serena! Blair! Happy
Birthday! Happy Birthday!

346
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,540
Oh, My God, Kati. Your
Brother's Place Looks Fabulous.

347
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,390
Yeah, I Know, Right? I Know. It's
Incredible. Come On, Guys. Let's Check It Out.

348
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,360
<i>Hai. Douzo.</i>

349
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,500
<i>Arigatou Gozaimasu.
Douitashimashite.</i>

350
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,370
Thank You. Hey. So Where's Nate?

351
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,350
Um, I'm Sure He'll Be Here Soon.

352
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,690
What About Dan? Oh,
Uh, He Said He's Coming,

353
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,660
But I Haven't Talked To
Him Since This Morning.

354
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,650
Well, You Better Check In On Him.

355
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,620
Make Sure The Best Friend
Hasn't Whisked Him Away

356
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,220
To Do Some Friendly
Activity. Oh, Shut Up.

357
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, There's Chuck. I Bet
He Knows Where Nate Is.

358
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,470
I Think Nate Probably Just
Snuck In While We Were Dancing.

359
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,890
Chuck.

360
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,290
Well, Thanks For Listening To Me

361
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,160
Complain About My Family All Afternoon.
Oh, Look, I Know It's Hard Right Now...

362
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,720
But Your Family's
One Of The Good Ones,

363
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,610
And Your Parents
Really Love Each Other.

364
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,910
They'll Figure It Out,

365
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,980
And In The Meantime, You've Got Me.

366
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,920
Um, Actually, I Was Gonna
Go Meet Up With Serena.

367
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,340
Oh, Sure. Have Fun.

368
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,260
I Will. What Are We Doing?

369
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,740
<i>I Thought You Said We
Weren't Doing Anything.</i>

370
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,850
I Like Serena, And I Like
You, And She Likes Me,

371
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,830
And You Like Me, So How-How
Can You Not Like Each Other?

372
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,340
It's Mathematically Impossible. Who Said
I Didn't Like Her? I Just Don't Know Her.

373
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,270
Yeah, And You're Making A
Real Effort To Change That.

374
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,130
I Mean, Why Spend Five Minutes

375
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,260
<i>Trying To Be Nice To Serena,
When I Can Spend Day After Day</i>

376
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,320
Forced To Choose
Between The Two Of You?

377
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,570
Okay, Fine. You Want To
See Me Get My Nice On?

378
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,250
Let's Do It Tonight. Just
You, Me And Serena. Um...

379
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,460
Tonight-Tonight Is Blair
Waldorf's Birthday Party.

380
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,000
Uh, I Think We Might Want
To Start By Dipping A Toe

381
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,880
Rather Than Diving Off Of A Cliff,

382
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,190
Headfirst, Into The
Rocks With The Sharks.

383
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,540
Why? We All Know
How To Swim. Come On.

384
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,550
You Want To Do This, Let's Do It.

385
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,210
Are You Ready For Your Present? Ow!

386
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,850
If You Wanted To Play Rough,
All You Had To Do Was Ask.

387
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,510
Hi. Hi. Hello There.

388
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,690
Happy Birthday To Me.

389
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,310
You Nauseate Me.

390
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,740
All This Talk About How
You Have To Be With Nate

391
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,990
Or The World Will End.

392
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,070
Face It. It's Over.

393
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,710
You Sound Like A Jealous Boyfriend.

394
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,540
Yeah, Right. You Wish.

395
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,280
No.

396
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,480
<i>You Wish.</i>

397
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,580
Please. You Forget
Who You're Talking To.

398
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,120
So Do You.

399
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,370
Do You...

400
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,700
Like Me?

401
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,170
Define "Like. "

402
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,610
Oh.

403
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,410
Uh, You Have Got To Be
Kidding. I Do Not Believe This.

404
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,400
<i>How Do You Think I Feel?</i>

405
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,210
I Haven't Slept. I Feel Sick,

406
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,480
Like There's Something
In My Stomach, Fluttering.

407
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,810
Butterflies?

408
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,970
No, No, No, No, No, No, No.

409
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,180
This Is Not-Not Happening.

410
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,720
Believe Me, No One Is More
Surprised Or Ashamed Than I Am.

411
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,310
Chuck, You Know That I
Adore All Of God's Creatures

412
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,070
And The Metaphors
That They Inspire,

413
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,350
But... Those Butterflies
Have Got To Be Murdered.

414
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,860
Fine. It Wasn't That Great Anyway.

415
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,360
Thanks.

416
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,690
Jenny.

417
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,500
Oh. Hi, Nate.

418
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,730
Hey. I Told Blair, And I
Shouldn't Have. I'm Sorry.

419
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,050
Oh, About What
Happened At The Ball?

420
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,700
It's, Uh, It's Not Your Fault.

421
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,090
So... How Have Things
Been Between You Guys?

422
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,160
Uh, Strange,

423
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,650
But Again, Not Your Fault.

424
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,100
So You Gonna Go Inside?

425
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,190
I Was Planning On It, But Now
That I'm Here, I'm Not So Sure.

426
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,440
Yeah. Me Neither.

427
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,050
Blair Invited Me Before Our Fight,

428
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,440
And I Was Gonna Run In
And Give Her This Card,

429
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,190
Which Says "I'm Sorry,
" Like, 30 Times.

430
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,210
Maybe You Could Just
Deliver It For Me, Though?

431
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,380
Uh, Do You Wanna Go
Take A Walk Or Something?

432
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,170
With You?

433
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,700
Um, What Would Blair Think?

434
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,840
Well, Blair's Up There.

435
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,200
Unless, Of Course, You Wanna Go.

436
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,300
It's Up To You.

437
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,860
A Walk Sounds Good.

438
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,620
Thank You.

439
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,760
Dan, You're Here!

440
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,890
And, Um, And You Brought Vanessa.

441
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,880
Hey. Good To See You.

442
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,480
Um, Kati And Is, You-You Know Dan.

443
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,200
Uh, Blair, This Is, Um,
Dan's Friend Vanessa.

444
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,420
Wow. You Didn't Mention
They Were So Nice.

445
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,600
Now I Get It.

446
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,430
Oh, Sweetie, You Did Not
Tell Me She Looked Like That.

447
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,870
This Is Such A Problem.

448
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,170
Rufus, I'm Sorry.

449
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,290
I Know That You're Upset.

450
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,900
You're Getting That, Huh?

451
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,170
Can You Please Talk To Me? Please?

452
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,140
I Only Have One Question,
And I'm Pretty Sure

453
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,490
I Don't Want To Hear The Answer.

454
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,390
It Happened One Time, And I
Wish It Hadn't, And It's Over.

455
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,740
Then Why Did Our Daughter
Have To Go To Hudson

456
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,430
And Drag You Back Here? Because
When We Spoke On The Phone,

457
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,650
I Didn't Really Get The Impression

458
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,970
That You Wanted To See Me.

459
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,730
I Thought I Should Give You Some Space.
This Family Has Had Way Too Much Space.

460
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,090
You Never Should Have Left. Can We
Not Go Through This Whole Thing Again?

461
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,930
Please. You Know
That I Wasn't Happy.

462
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,190
Yeah. You Happy Now?

463
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,340
In Some Ways, I Am. I Know
You Don't Want To Hear That.

464
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,220
Look, Please Don't Act
Like You Care What I Want.

465
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,950
Rufus.

466
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,480
I Was There For You When You
Were All About Your Music,

467
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,470
When You Were On The
Road For Months At A Time

468
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,080
And Everything That Went With It.

469
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:35,610
My Whole Adult Life
Has Been About You.

470
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,390
<i>And Now I'm The One
That's Screwed Up.</i>

471
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,350
I Guess I Was A Late Bloomer.

472
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,430
I Just Need You To Care
Enough About Me To Try.

473
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,040
Alison...

474
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,690
I Care.

475
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,690
I Care.

476
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,760
Whoo!

477
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,500
Whoo!

478
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,520
Stalk Me Much?

479
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,080
What Are You Still
Doing Up Here All Alone?

480
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,660
I Don't Know Where Nate Is,

481
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,140
And He Always Calls Me At Midnight,

482
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,480
When It Turns Into My Birthday.
Well, I Wouldn't Count On It Tonight.

483
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,760
Doesn't It Strike You
As, Uh, Just A Little Bit

484
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,830
Of Coincidence, The Timing Of
Everything? What Do You Mean?

485
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,930
Well, Nate Suddenly Decides
He Wants To Get Back Together

486
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,990
Just Moments After Your Mother

487
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,580
Puts The Brakes On Her
Deal With The Captain?

488
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,390
So You're Saying That Nate
Is Only Pretending To Like Me,

489
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,410
And That He's Actually
Using Me To Get To My Mother?

490
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,290
He Wouldn't Do That.

491
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,370
Yes, He Would.

492
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,880
If It Was To Help His
Family, You Know He Would.

493
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,890
Nate Loves Me.

494
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,260
Whatever He's Doing,
Wherever He Is,

495
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,300
He Will Call At
Midnight. You'll See.

496
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,780
Care To Make A Wager?

497
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,070
If He Calls, I'll
Leave You Alone Forever.

498
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,900
If He Doesn't, You
Spend The Night With Me.

499
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,390
I Will Not.

500
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,800
I Thought You Were Sure.

501
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,130
You're Gonna Lose.

502
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,650
He's Never Missed My Birthday.

503
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:31,660
<i>Careful, B.</i>

504
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,460
<i>There's No Safe Wager
When You Bet On A Bass.</i>

505
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,600
<i>You Just Might Lose Your
Shirt And Your Pants.</i>

506
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,100
So You Brought Vanessa As
Your Date To Blair's Party?

507
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,130
<i>No, No, You're My Date.
I Just Thought It Might</i>

508
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,120
Be A Good Opportunity For All Three Of Us
To Hang Out. Oh, Yeah, 'Cause It Was So Fun

509
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,880
And Not Remotely Awkward
At Breakfast This Morning.

510
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,090
Fine. You're-You're- You're
Right. I Actually Thought

511
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,450
This Would Be A Very Bad
Opportunity For Us To Hang Out,

512
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,000
But I Kind Of Suggested To Vanessa

513
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,410
That She Wasn't Making An
Effort To Get To Know You,

514
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,980
So, Uh, She Decided
To Start Tonight,

515
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,820
But If It's Weird,
I Can Go Talk To Her.

516
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,550
No. No, No, No, Don't Do That.

517
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,950
Look, Tell Me Something
Vanessa Likes Besides You,

518
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,840
And I Will Make An
Effort To Bond. I Promise.

519
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,680
Oh, Thank You.

520
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,920
So What Now?

521
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,700
Ever Play "Guitar Hero"?

522
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,080
Yeah!

523
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,710
Thank You. Thank You.
Oh, She Owned You, Serena.

524
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,990
Yeah, You Went Down Almost As Hard

525
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:41,100
As Britney At The V.M.A.S. Okay,
You Know, You're Good, Vanessa.

526
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,650
I'll Admit It, But I Have
Been Holding Back Until Now.

527
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,970
There's A Little Birdie
That's About To Be Free.

528
00:27:48,005 --> 00:27:48,005
<i>And You're Rockin'.</i>

529
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,560
That's My Girl!
That's It. Right There.

530
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,210
Thank You. Thank
You. Who Got On Now?

531
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,850
Not Bad, But Skynyrd
Is Meat And Potatoes,

532
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,160
And I'm Bringing Dessert,
So What Do You Say

533
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,240
To A Slice Of "Cherry Pie"?

534
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:09,840
No Pie. I Say No, I Beg You. Come On.
There's Nothing Like A Little '80s Hair Metal

535
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,390
To Put A Smile On Your Face.
After The Day You've Had?

536
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,020
The-The Day You've Had? What-
What Kind Of Day Have You Had?

537
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,670
You Didn't Tell Her?

538
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,480
Uh, No. No, Not Yet. Not Yet.

539
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,830
Um, It Was Kind Of An Odd
Day At The Humphrey Loft.

540
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,610
Uh, Actually, Jenny
Brought My Mom Home.

541
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,360
Your Mom's Back?

542
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,360
Yeah.

543
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,640
Excuse Me.

544
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,140
I Can't Believe You Didn't
Tell Me Your Mom Came Home.

545
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,710
I'm Sorry, Really. Uh...

546
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,770
What? You Didn't Think It Was
Important? No, No, Of Course It Is.

547
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,620
Why Bother? You
Already Told Vanessa.

548
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:58,330
I Tell Vanessa Everything, All
Right? I Have Since I Was 6.

549
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,810
Well, You're Not 6 Anymore, Dan.

550
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,680
I Just-I Was Just Hoping
That I Would Be The Person

551
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,670
That You Would Wanna
Tell These Things To Now.

552
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,280
I Want You To Be That Person, Too.

553
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,720
Really, I Do.

554
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,340
This Whole Girlfriend Thing
Is Very New To Me, You Know?

555
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,210
I
- I Just...

556
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,110
I Don't Know All The Rules Yet.

557
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,660
Well, Blair Says In A Relationship,

558
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,060
The Best Friend Is
- Serena, You're Really Taking Relationship Advice From Blair?

559
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,100
Good Point.

560
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,090
Look, I Just Don't Want To
Have To Compete With Vanessa.

561
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,400
You Know, With
"Guitar Hero, " Okay.

562
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,350
<i>I'm Way More Awesome, If
You Didn't Happen To Notice.</i>

563
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,760
But, Um, Not With You.

564
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,930
That's Fair.

565
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,520
All Right, So Tomorrow, You And I

566
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,300
Will Go Somewhere Together,
Just The Two Of Us,

567
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,120
And We Will Talk About My
Family In Excruciating Detail

568
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,980
Until You Are
- You're Just So Bored,

569
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,570
You're Begging For Vanessa
To Take Over, All Right?

570
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,470
How's That Sound?

571
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,100
Perfect.

572
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,210
All Right.

573
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,120
Come On. It's Almost Midnight.

574
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,900
What Happens At Midnight?

575
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,860
I Heard About Your Dad.

576
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,270
I'm Sorry.

577
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,050
Well, If It Makes
You Feel Any Better,

578
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,070
My Family's Not Doing That
Great Right Now Either.

579
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,820
You Know, I Actually Didn't
Want To Come To Blair's Party

580
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,350
As Much As I Just Wanted
To Get Out Of My House.

581
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,340
Yeah, I Know The Feeling.

582
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,980
Blair's Birthday Present.

583
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,980
Your Mother's Ring.

584
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,770
Blair Told Me About It.

585
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,430
Wow. It's Beautiful.

586
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,150
I'm, Uh, Supposed To
Give It To Blair Tonight.

587
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,400
I'm Guessing That Wasn't Your Idea.

588
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,510
Blair And I Broke Up,

589
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,400
And I Know It Was
The Right Thing To Do.

590
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,150
I Mean, We Just Shouldn't Be
Together Right Now, You Know?

591
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,850
Sounds Like You're
Pretty Sure Of That.

592
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,300
I Am, And As Much As I
Wanna Do The Right Thing

593
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,150
And Help Out My Parents,
It's Just-It's Not Fair.

594
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,890
I Mean, To Me Or To Blair.

595
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:11,020
I Just Think That If I Do This Now,

596
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,310
When Does It Ever Stop?

597
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,130
It'll Only Stop When You Stop It.

598
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,190
12:01. I'm Sorry.

599
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,750
No, You're Smarmy.
There's A Difference.

600
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,940
If You're Coming To
Collect, You Can Forget It.

601
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,350
Turn Around.

602
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,040
You Get Grosser By The Second.

603
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,230
You Get Older. Look.

604
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,570
Happy Birthday!

605
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,670
Blair, Blow Out
Your Candles. I Know.

606
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,580
Make A Wish, Blair.

607
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,970
It Already Didn't Come True.

608
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,120
<i>Happy Birthday To Who?</i>

609
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,550
<i>Forget Cake And Ice Cream.</i>

Hey.

613
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,540
So I Don't Know How It Was Possible

614
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,560
Given How The Day Started,

615
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,450
But, Um, I Actually Had
Kind Of A Good Night.

616
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,990
Your Parents Won't Be Mad You're
Coming Home So Late, Right?

617
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,290
Oh, No, They Think
I'm With A Friend.

618
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,920
Huh. Well, They Think Right.

619
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,970
I Had Fun.

620
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,270
Me, Too. You Have A Good Night.

Did You Guys See This? I Can't Believe
Gossip Girl Would Do This To Her

626
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,550
On Her Birthday. You Know
What? Maybe She's Wrong.

627
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,820
It Wouldn't Be The First
Time. Blair, Hey, I'm So Sorry.

628
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,270
I Never Would've Thought That This Would
Happen. I Hope The Slut Gave Him Herpes.

629

Cheater Totally Deserves Herpes.

630
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,040
He Isn't Cheating.

We Broke Up, Okay?

632
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,770
He Was Gonna Get
Back Together With Me,

633
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:22,450
But Only So My Mom
Would Help His Dad.

634
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,980
You Satisfied?

635
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,410
Blair.

636
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,960
Blair, Stop, Okay? Talk To Me.

637
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,400
We Ended It.

638
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:44,000
I Wanted To Tell You, But-But
Part Of Me Thought That

639
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,090
If I Didn't Say It Out Loud,
Then It Wouldn't Be True.

640
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,400
Shh. Shh.

641
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:54,310
It Was My Birthday Wish
For Us To Get Back Together.

642
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,350
Now I Think It's Really Over.

643
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,700
Oh, Blair, Shh.

644
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:03,010
Is It Okay If I Just Wanna
Be Alone For A Second?

645
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,240
Nate, Hey. What Are
You Doing Home So Early?

646
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,440
It's After Midnight. We Just
Thought You'd Be With Blair.

647
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:16,460
How Did She Like Her Gift? I
Didn't Make It To The Party Tonight.

648
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,150
Well, Her Actual Birthday Is Today.

649
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,550
You Can Call Her In The
Morning, Maybe Take Her To Lunch.

650
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,900
It's A Good Plan. Really
More Special This Way.

651
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,130
Dad, I Know You Think
Blair Will Help Save You,

652
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,370
But I'm Not Doing This.

653
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,870
It's Over.

654
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,010
Nate.

655
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,010
There's Nothing In This World

656
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,920
I Wouldn't Do To
Protect Our Family,

657
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,040
And I'm Sure You Feel The Same.

658
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,940
I Need Your Support
Here, Son, And Your Trust.

659
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,540
Well, You Better Hope For Your Sake

660
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,160
They Don't Call Your
Son To The Stand.

661
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,590
Hmm.

662
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,560
God, I Have Missed Your Smile.

663
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,250
Mm. I Have Missed Everything.

664
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,690
Mm.

665
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,690
Please Tell Me That Is Someone
Coming To Rob The House.

666
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,800
Hey, Mom.

667
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,120
Hey, Dad.

668
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,050
Hey, Jenny.

669
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,300
As You Were.

670
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,250
Is Your Friend Gonna Be Okay?

671
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,220
Um, I'm Not Sure.

672
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,020
She Just Broke Up
With Her Boyfriend,

673
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,580
And Then They Got Back
Together And Then, Um,

674
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,070
I Don't Know What Just Happened.

675
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:50,540
Well, She's Lucky To Have
You. Being A Good Friend Is...

676
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,530
Challenging At Times?

677
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,170
Hey, If I've Been Acting
However I've Been Acting,

678
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,010
It's Just 'Cause I'm
Protective Of Dan.

679
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,810
And I'm Protective
Of Our Relationship.

680
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,390
I've Never Actually Had One Before.

681
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,400
You Guys Just Have
Everything In Common,

682
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,790
And, Um, I'm Just
Getting To Know Him.

683
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,610
So, You Know, It Can Be
A Little Intimidating.

684
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,270
Talk About Intimidating.

685
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,560
<i>You Just Admitted That
You Find Me Intimidating,</i>

686
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,510
So How Cool Does That Make You?

687
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,970
I Think You Forgot To Mention

688
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:27,060
My Superior "Guitar Hero" Skills.

689
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,800
No, I Didn't Forget That.

690
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,400
And At The Next Party,
I'm Asking For A Rematch,

691
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,910
'Cause You Were
About To Get Smoked.

692
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,850
Oh, Really? Well, I Think
The Only Thing Getting Smoked

693
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,830
Is Your Pale Imitation Of A Guitar
Player. Hey, I Am A Golden God.

694
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,720
Oh, Really? Are You Now? Hey.
Am-Am I Interrupting Anything?

695
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,700
Um, Actually, You Are.

696
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,690
I'll Give You Guys A Moment.

697
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,820
Might That Have Been Bonding
That I Just Walked In On?

698
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,910
A Little Bit. Yeah? What
Were You Talking About?

699
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,680
Nothing You Need To Know About.

700
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,960
Oh, So You Have Secrets Now? I See.

701
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,920
Well, Listen, Um, If You
Want To Get Out Of Here,

702
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,160
Vanessa Can Only Fit Two On
Her Vespa, But I Can Walk.

703
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,350
Oh, Well, You Know
I Love Me A Vespa,

704
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,760
But, Um, I Think I Gotta
Stay Here And Be With Blair.

705
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,790
You're Not The Only
One With A Best Friend.

706
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:12,950
Yeah.

707
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,490
I'm Not In The Mood, Chuck.

708
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,650
This Is Pretty Much
The Worst Birthday Ever.

709
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,750
Maybe It Can Be Salvaged.

710
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,440
Is That Our Sex Tape?

711
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,210
It's The Erickson Beamon Necklace.

712
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,920
No, I Couldn't.

713
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,680
Yes, You Can.

714
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,690
Something This Beautiful

715
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,550
Deserves To Be Seen On
Someone Worthy Of Its Beauty.

716
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,670
I Really Am Sorry.
