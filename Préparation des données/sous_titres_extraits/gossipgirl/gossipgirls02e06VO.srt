Morning, miss blair.

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,200
<i>And some are the dreams
we've had our whole lives.</i>

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,300
Docaeve??
That i just ihree short hours,

48
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll be stepping through
the gates of yale?

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,900
You used to sleep??

50
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,000
Until it fell aparel??

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
I'll get a new one,

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,500
Right after i attend the dean
of admissions' e receptiourse.??

53
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,400
??

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
But daddy was invited
when he visited.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,300
Your mother already left??

56
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,900
But she was very specific
about your breakfast.

57
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,700
Some kombucha, miss blair?

58
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,100
Since the dean handpicks the guests
right after their interviews,

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
I'm a shoo-In.

60
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,200
If there's one thing i know,
it's that i give good interview.

61
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
I could make larry king cry.

62
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,700
I am so proud of you.

63
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,200
And i'm so ready to be surrounded
by people more like me and less like...

64
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,600
Her.

65
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,200
??

66
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,000
You've got to be kidding me.

67
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,100
Ready?

68
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,700
Oh, yeah. Um,

69
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm all packed up.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You excited,
me at your alma mater?

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So i guess that means
you turned down this, uh,

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,600
Personal invitation to tour yale?

73
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,800
Brown's always bn my plan,
just like it was for you.

74
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
And i loved it there.

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,200
But if yale had invited me,

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,000
I would have said yes.

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The, uh, invitation is
handwritten, serena, in cursive.

78
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,100
Yale is for overachieving
bookworms and preppies--

79
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,800
The blairs of the world.

80
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,400
Even though the two of us
aren't exactly on speaking terms,

81
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,000
There's no way i would step
on that particular land mine.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,600
Miss serena and you
are still not speaking?

83
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Not a word in a week,
though i can't seem to escape her.

84
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,700
Ever since my mother's show,

85
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,200
Manhattan has turned into serenaville.

86
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,700
I heard marc jacobs
named a purse after her.

87
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,400
<i>Well, i simply don't understand
the fascination.</i>

88
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,000
Fortunately,
yale is out of her reach.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,500
It's okay, serena. You don't
have to hide the photo.

90
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
I've seen it.

91
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,900
I'm sorry they called you
my unidentified friend.

92
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,600
Well, i guess it's better
than "mother."

93
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,500
What's in the bag?

94
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,300
It's my dress for
the fall dinner at the frick.

95
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,900
Eleanor sent them over.

96
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,600
I don't know why there's two.

97
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,700
This one's a little edgier
than i thought,

98
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,700
But i like it.

99
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,600
Apparently it's for me.

100
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, this must be mine.

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,800
It is a really nice color, though.

102
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,400
Dad, what do you think??

103
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Of the paper?

104
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,000
- It's white.
- No, no. It's not white.

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,100
It's soft ecru. This is--
That's white.

106
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,400
I like the ecru myself,
but i'm not sure about the font.

107
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,200
Don't worry. You'll be fine.
More than fine.

108
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,400
- You're the perfect yale candidate.
- Maybe,

109
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,700
??That yale is for presidents,
not humphreys.

110
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,400
As the man who cursed you??

111
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,000
I didn't say "cursed."
"Cursed" would be cruel.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,700
I now feel compelled
to give a speech.

113
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,500
Daniel, my son, you have
near perfect grades,

114
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,800
Excellent s.A.T.S, more talent
than money could ever buy.

115
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,700
Yeah, but...

116
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,100
After that, you find a "but"?

117
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,000
What if it's not enough?

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,800
If that's not enough,

119
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,100
Then there's something wrong
with yale, not you.

120
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,700
Thanks, dad.

121
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,200
All right, wei'm--I'm off.

122
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,500
It's just me, the best
english department in america

123
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,300
And a hundred other highly competitive
extremely nervous, wannabe yalies.

124
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,700
Get excited, archibald.

125
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,400
We are three hours away from
horny women's studies majors

126
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,200
Wanting to work out all their anger
towards men in their bunk beds.

127
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,800
My heart's still set on u.S.C.

128
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,600
I-I just wish my mom
wouldn't push yale so hard.

129
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,500
I think she's only pushing it

130
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,000
'Cause the vanderbilt side of
her family practically owns it.

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,200
Think of it this way.

132
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,600
Yale is your safety school.

133
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,700
I mean, i guess i could get away
from all the drama

134
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,300
On the other side my family

135
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,500
And go someplace where they
don't know me the captain.

136
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,700
We blow off??
And focus on what really matters--

137
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,500
Creating your own freshman 15.

138
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,200
Are you not seriously considering
going to yale either?

139
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,600
I'm, uh, evaating colleges
based on secret societies.

140
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,300
Yale has the cr??

141
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,600
??

142
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,900
My goal is to get inside
their inner sanctum.

143
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,100
And how exactly are you
o do that???

144
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,100
By showing up.

145
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,200
??

146
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,600
??Rvard, yale d,brown--

147
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
Are among the best in the world.

148
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,900
You are ambassadors
of constance billard and st. Jude's,

149
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,500
As well as your own families.

150
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,400
We urge you to present yourselves
in the best possible light. Good luck.

151
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,100
I wonder what lucky school will
be the subject of the next nursery rhyme

152
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,800
Penned by brooklyn's
lamest fiction writer?

153
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,600
Actually, chuck, i think
the dean of admissions at yale

154
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,100
Will actually appreciate my ability
to write about, uh, damaged characters.

155
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,000
Looks like we'll be spending??

156
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How nice.

157
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Say hello to the characters
on public transportation for me.

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,900
Hey.

159
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,400
So you're off to yale?

160
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,300
Your deductive reasoning skills
are perfect for a place like brown.

161
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,400
A place like brown?

162
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,900
An enclave of trustafarians
and children of celebrities

163
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,800
Who major in drum circles
and semiotics, whatever that is.

164
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,300
I can't wait for you
to come home next thanksgiving

165
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,200
A militant veganista,
anemic and proud.

166
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,000
Brown is ??

167
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,200
Everyone knows that the only
real ivies are the holy trinity--

168
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Harvard, yale and princeton.

169
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,700
I know you may find this
hard to believe,

170
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,200
But not everyone wants to go to yale

171
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,500
Beca1 e not evyo e blair waldorf.??

172
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,200
<i>Not everyone can be.</i>

173
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,800
Since friends anymore,
e, spenkly.??

174
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,200
??That smart.

175
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
??You lack focla and discindine.

176
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Charm is all well and good,

177
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,000
But in the real world,
knowledge is power.

178
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,200
You wo't make it past
the first round admissions at yale,

179
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,900
No matter how hard you tried.

180
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,600
Have fun in providence.

181
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Oh, and, you know,

182
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,900
Maybe you can get your hair
dreadlocked while you're there.

183
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,600
<i>Gossip girl's hardly a war buff,</i>

184
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,100
<i>But i did cram for a quiz
or two on the american revolution.</i>

185
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,100
<i>??The last te e new haven
was invaded was in 1779.</i>

186
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hey, mom.

187
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Change of plans.

188
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,900
Tell the driver we're going to yale.

189
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,500
<i>Heads up, b.</i>

190
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,800
<i>There's a cannonball
coming your way.</i>

191
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,500
Oh, after that shower, there won't
be any hot water left in the building.

192
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,700
I wasn't in the shower the whole time.

193
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,200
I was waiting for something.

194
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,000
I got here as fast as i could.

195
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,900
I know. I, uh, saw you
??Runningrom my win

196
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,000
What's going on here?

197
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,900
Did you know that vanessa's
applying for n.Y.U. Next fall?

198
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,300
Something??
Without finishing high school.

199
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,100
Which she's doing??

200
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,000
Which she has to do because
she has to work to support herself.

201
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,400
Living as an adult
when you're a teenager

202
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,500
??Is not something any parent
ens for their child.

203
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,800
Well, what about??

204
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Well, until you're 18,

205
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,000
What you want gets trumped
by what i want.

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,900
Plan "b."

207
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,000
Come to the atelier with me today.

208
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,200
- Come with you?
- I'll make you a deal.

209
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,900
Spend the day with me,
and by the end of the day,

210
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,000
If you honestly think that i should
go back to constance on monday, i will.

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,700
Jenny, i've seen ??

212
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,900
Heard about your internship
all summer long.

213
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,200
What more is there?

214
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,000
Well, things are different now.

215
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,500
Well, at least we'll be moving
forward in one way or another.

216
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
It's a deal.

217
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,800
- You mean it?
- You have my word.

218
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Thank you!

219
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,000
<i>We hear there's nothing
like yale in octobin??--</i>

220
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,400
<i>The crisp air,
the turning leaves,</i>

221
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,700
<i>The invasion
of prospective freshmen.</i>

222
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
<i>Better hurry up, lonely boy.</i>

223
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,400
<i>Your future's waiting.</i>

224
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,900
To summarize, i-I really feel that
i have something to say.

225
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,400
Well, by all means, say it.

226
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,300
Via my writing. Uh, with--

227
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,900
With its world-Class
english department,

228
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,000
Yale wouldthe ideal place
for me to grow as a--

229
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
As a writer, to--
To flourish and, uh, thrive.

230
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,600
Kudos to you and your
inner thesaurus, mr. Humphrey,

231
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,500
But there's a problem
with your application.

232
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,500
A-A-A pr--No, there's um,
i double--I triple-Checked it.

233
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,200
It seems you only have one letter
of recommendation from j.L. Hall.

234
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Noah shapiro declined
to write on your behalf.

235
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,000
Um, mr. Shapiro and i
had creative differences,

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But--But if you iok
further dorty application,

237
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,900
You'll see that i spent the summer
interning with jeremiah harris.

238
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,600
A fact which mr. Harris
has not been able to confirm himself.

239
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,500
Did you--Did you call him
early in the morning?

240
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,200
'Cause he's not--
He's not a-??Aning person.

241
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
I mean, he's not
an afternoon person either.

242
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
- If you try, like, after 7:00--
- Mr. Humphrey,

243
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,300
If you want
your application to stand out,

244
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,300
You need another letter,

245
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,100
One about your work.

246
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,300
Another letter from whom and how?

247
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,400
This is yale.

248
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,200
If you haven't noticed,

249
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,400
We traffic in brick buildings
full of professors.

250
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,200
I suggest you put on
your walking shoes,

251
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,900
Head to the english department
and find someone to read your work.

252
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,800
I thought we were gonna do something.

253
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,600
What happened to your master plan,
finding the skull and bones?

254
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,100
You don't find them.

255
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,900
They find you.

256
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,700
That's good.
So we'll just sit here and wait.

257
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,400
I mean, there's a l-Ll game at 1:00??

258
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Or a tour of the university
art gallery at 3:00.

259
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,700
Good luck sitting on your ass.

260
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,000
Hey. Excuse me.

261
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,500
Can i ask you a question?

262
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,600
Oh, my. The dean hasn't
laughed like that in years.

263
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,300
It was an utter delight to
meet you, miss van der woodsen.

264
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,500
What a lovely surprise.

265
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,800
Oh, and who doesn't like a surprise?

266
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,100
I do hope you enjoy
the rest of your visit.

267
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,400
Thank you so much.

268
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,900
Looks like he's ready for you.

269
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,600
Shall we, miss waldorf?

270
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,400
I've never been more prepared.

271
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,500
So whatever major you decide on,
you n mix up with electives.??

272
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,400
Yale's are better than most.

273
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,500
Oh, really?
Well, what's your favorite?

274
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,600
It's a toss-Up

275
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,300
Between the role of sex in art
and great hoaxes in archaeology.

276
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,200
Those are seriously classes?

277
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,000
What school are you here from?

278
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,400
- St. Jude's in new york.
- St. Jude's?

279
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,600
Then you must know,
uh, nate archibald.

280
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,000
I heard he's on campus
this weekend.

281
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,100
Why does that name??

282
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,600
He's the son of
howard "the captain" archibald.

283
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,700
We've been talking about him in econ.

284
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,800
The guy's like a modern milken.

285
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,300
Hey, uh, jordan, do you want
to show me around campus?

286
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,300
I'd love to see it.

287
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,900
Sure, but before i go anywhere
with a stranger,

288
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,000
I think maybe you should
tell me your name.

289
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,900
Oh, my name, of course, um,

290
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,200
Is dan.

291
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,400
Dan humphrip.

292
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,500
All right.

293
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,800
Chuck bass,
heir to bass industries,

294
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,300
Champion of the legendary
lost weekend.

295
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,100
Rumor has it you've slept with more
"maxim" covers than john mayer.

296
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,500
And better, i might add.

297
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
If our intel's correct,

298
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,400
You're our prime candidate
from next year's class,

299
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
But we don't take anything on hearsay.

300
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,200
We need to know firsthand
if you're as good as your advertising.

301
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,600
Well,

302
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,500
I come prepared.

303
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,800
??How about w little private party
to kick things off?

304
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,600
What do you have in mind?

305
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,400
I have to say,

306
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,900
Your application is
most impressive, miss waldorf.

307
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,600
There's just one thing
i'd like to know.

308
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,200
Tell me something about you
that isn't in that packet.

309
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,100
Not in there?

310
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,200
Do you like to drive race carsac

311
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,300
Can you cook authentic szechuan?

312
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,000
The young lady before you
told me a delightful story.

313
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,800
She was recently
in a fashion show just for fun.

314
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,500
I know i must seem ??Traditional
compared to that young lady

315
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,400
But isn't tradition
what yale is all about?

316
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,200
Well, yes, but we've been
trying to change that age.??

317
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,600
Too stuffy.

318
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,600
So?

319
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,800
Well...

320
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,300
<i>I'm aware i lack some people's</i>

321
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,800
Easy grace with strangers,

322
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,500
And i don't exactly
make you feel like

323
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,700
You've known me forever
even though we just met.

324
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,900
When i laugh,

325
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,300
You might not smile just
at the coquettish sound of it.

326
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,400
And i may not be "spontaneous"

327
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,000
Or "delightful"
or "full of surprises,"

328
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,700
And my hair might not sparkle
when it catches the light...

329
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,300
Everything worth knowing
about me is in that folder.

330
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
I sure of it.

331
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,600
Well, isn't there anything else
you'd like to ask me?

332
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Maybe about what my plans are
for tonight?

333
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,500
There's so much to do on campus.
I'm sure you'll find something.

334
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,300
It was so nice to meet you.

335
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,100
Right.

336
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,200
Good luck then.

337
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,700
Oh, god.

338
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,800
Great hoaxes in archaeology--

339
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,000
Is that even a class?

340
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,300
What are you doing, serena?

341
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,900
These lovely people were just
showing me the course catalog.

342
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,800
No, here. Yale.

343
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
Yale is mine.

344
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,300
Well, i'll admit,

345
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,800
I came to punish you for the things
you said to me this morning.

346
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,100
Fine. Consider me punished.
You can go home now.

347
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,700
I actually like it here.

348
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,600
The campus is beautiful,
the people are so nice,

349
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,700
And do2 now how great
the drama school is?

350
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,000
Of course i do.

351
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,900
??

352
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,700
The dean made me realize
that by being so set on brown,

353
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,100
I closed myself off
to all other options.

354
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
??That's a lovely epiphany.

355
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,700
I'm afraid it's irrelevant.

356
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
It's not as if you
actually get in here.

357
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,700
Hello?

358
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,100
An intimate gathering
at the dean's house tonight?

359
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,900
I'd be honored.

360
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,200
Thank you.

361
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,400
You were invited to my gathering.

362
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,200
You might want to make other plans.

363
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,900
She said i was her last call.

364
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,300
Of all the things--

365
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,500
Nate...

366
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,200
My mom...

367
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,200
The girls at school--

368
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,600
You wouldn't take this from me...

369
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,300
Because if you do,

370
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,800
I swear i will take you down.

371
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,400
I'm not taking anything
from you, blair. I was invited.

372
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,000
And as for taking me down,

373
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,600
I'd love to see you try.

374
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,800
<i>When it comes to w??,</i>

375
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,800
<i>The rule is never retreat,
never surrender.</i>

376
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,200
<i>??Oever said that
never met the new serena.</i>

377
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,200
<i>Spotted--</i>

378
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,600
<i>Little jenny humphrey
off her high horse</i>

379
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,400
<i>And in high demand.</i>

380
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,600
Did you look at the resort samples?

381
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,800
Eleanor wants your opinion.

382
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
Oh, no, i didn't,
but i'll do that right now.

383
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,600
And we got in the chambray you like.

384
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,700
We need your advice
on whatterns they go with.

385
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,500
I didn't realize it was
bring your father to work day.

386
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,800
Yes, well, ??

387
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,900
To show me why this is
so important to her.

388
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,700
- Do you have a moment?
- Just.

389
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,400
I gave jenny my wordmething this m??

390
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,500
But i'm not sure if i can keep it.

391
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,000
- I need your help.
- What can i do for you?

392
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,300
Fire her.

393
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,600
I will do no such thing.

394
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,100
Fashion is a young person's career,
and this is jenny's moment.

395
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,500
She's only 15 years old.

396
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,300
The opportunity can wait
till she's ready.

397
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,200
Do you remember the dreams you had
when you were 15, mr. Humphrey?

398
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,900
What if they all started to come true?

399
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,100
Would you have told them to wait?

400
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,000
Just make sure
they're up for anything.

401
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,600
This crowd can get particular.

402
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,800
Well, i know
you're not a geography whiz,

403
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,000
But you aware that providence
is in rhode island?

404
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,300
I don't have time to explain.

405
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,900
I've been invited
to the dean's house tonight.

406
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,800
- I have to get ready.
- The dean's house?

407
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,700
Nice. What's your answer
to his question?

408
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,300
- Yes?
- No, no, no, no.

409
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,800
"What person, real or imagined,
living or dead,

410
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,600
Would you most like
to have dinner with?"

411
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,900
The rumor is, if your answer
impresses the dean enough,

412
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
It's gets you on the short list
for early admission,

413
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,200
Or so says blair.

414
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,600
I should have given my spot to her.

415
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,000
You got invited, and she didn't?

416
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,600
You're lucky to be alive.

417
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,400
Yeah, well, i won't be much longer
??I don't find an answer fast.

418
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,800
Steal blais.

419
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,500
She has no use for it anymore.

420
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,300
No. No, i can't,
no matter how good it is.

421
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,100
George sand.

422
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,500
I did not want to know that.
And how do you even know that?

423
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,900
Wait. Why does blair want to go to
dinner with some guy named george.??

424
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,800
??Hot girl named george.

425
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,700
She dressed like a man

426
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,000
And apparently is
the dean's favorite writer.

427
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
And i know this
because talking with blair

428
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,900
About how she's going to get
into yale gets her really--

429
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,500
Chuck, no. You just told me two
things i never wanted to hear,

430
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
And one is gonna haunt me
for the rest of my life.

431
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Okay,

432
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,000
Before we go any further...

433
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,000
I have to know something.

434
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,600
Tell me the truth.

435
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,900
As a writer,
what do you think of m??

436
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,700
??Um,

437
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,600
That's a tough one.

438
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,800
Okay, you're right.
It's too broad.

439
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,300
Let's just talk "cholera."

440
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
Very painful.

441
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,200
No, i'm not kidding.

442
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,000
I tried to read it,
and i couldn't get through it.

443
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,500
It's ridiculous.

444
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,200
U're funny...

445
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,700
And sweet.

446
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,200
Not like most writers i meet.

447
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,400
Hello?

448
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,300
Hi. Jordan steele?

449
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,300

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,200

of the lit department.

Yeah. Um, can you ???

452
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,600
I apologize for hunting you
down now, but i'm--I'm desperate.

453
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,500
I need someone to read my work and
write a letter before the weekend's out,

454
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,900
And i-I was, uh, i was hoping
you could help me.

455
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,900
- Nate?
- Um, help you what?

456
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,900
Th-That's, uh,
that's nate archibald.

457
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,900
No, that's dan humphrey.

458
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,100
N--What?

459
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,000
Nate archibald.

460
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,100
Dan humphrey.

461
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,500
<i>No, she was really into me,
and next thing i know,</i>

462
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,700
She's throwing a book
at my head.

463
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,300
<i>Yeah, faulkner. It looked
not that you'd know.</i>

464
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,200
No, what i do know is that you didn't have to
mess it up for me right then and the andwell, wh

465
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,400
??? Watch you continue to screw up
my last chance at making a connection

466
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,200
In the lit department
for pseudonymous sex?

467
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,500
- No, that's not why i did it.
- Is it funnfor you?
Because my future's utjoke.

468
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,700
- It's not.
- ???

469
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,500
Look, 3 i'm sure that
your life is complicated with--

470
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,400
With your family
and, um, i don't know, girls,

471
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,300
But you can't pretend
to be me.

472
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,600
Maybe it's okay to use people like
that in your world, but it's not in mine.

473
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,700
Do ever get tired of carrying around
that chip on your shoulder, dan?

474
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,800
No wonder serena dumped you.

475
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Hello, shirley.

476
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,300
I would like an invitation to the private
reception at the dean's house tonight,

477
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,700
And you're going
to get me one.

478
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,900
I'm sorry.

479
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,700
I'm not in charge
of the dean's private affairs.

480
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,000
???

481
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,000
???

482
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,500
Interviews are so stressful
for you students.

483
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,900
Check your e-Mail.

484
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,900
18th century.

485
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,200
Do you know how rare
a pair is from that era?

486
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,700
I had someone at christie's
put them on hold

487
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Just in case.

488
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,900
1100 hillhouse avenue.

489
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,300
<i>Poor s. She should know
b.'S rules by now.</i>

490
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,100
<i>When someone leaves you
off the list,</i>

491
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,900
???

492
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,100
Well?

493
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,700
I'm impressed.

494
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,900
You're clearly valued here.

495
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You handle yourself
very professionally.

496
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Thank you.

497
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,100
But...

498
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,300
I think you should
go back to school.

499
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,000
But you just said
you were impressed.

500
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,300
I don't...

501
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,400
I don't understand.

502
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,600
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

503
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,900
I just think
school's too important.

504
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,200
Okay.

505
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,200
If that's what you think,
that's what you think.

506
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,900
We made a deal,
and i agreed to it, so...

507
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,100
I have to say, i thought
there'd be som10yelling.

508
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,900
You said you'd give me a day,
and you did.

509
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,700
Gcan, um,

510
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,400
Can you at least take me to complete one
last errand before we go home?

511
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,800
- Sure.
- Thanks.

512
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,700
Trying to come up with an answer
for the dean's parlor game?

513
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,600
You manipulated
your way in here?

514
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,000
I get what i want, serena, just
like i'm gonna win tonight.

515
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,600
What's your answer?

516
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,500
Oh, no, let me guess.

517
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
Lauren conrad.

518
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,300
Try george sand.

519
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,100
- Wait. That's--
- Your answer? Not anymore.

520
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,900
If you're gonna cheat your way
in, then why should i play fair?

521
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,200
Oh, and i heard that the dean asks
his question in alphabetical order,

522
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,100
So since "v" comes before "w,"

523
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,000
It looks like the answer
is all mine.

524
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,300
How kind of you.

525
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
???

526
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,400
Your party has arrived,
straight from...

527
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,400
I can't tell you
where they're from actually,

528
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,000
But they're the best
money can buy.

529
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,900
Before you ask,
they don't snglish,

530
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,900
And they don't care.

531
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,000
By the way, that's not one
for each of you.

532
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,300
They do their best work
in threes.

533
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,900
Not bad, bass,

534
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,600
But you're not done.

535
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,600
The girls are all right,
but they're just girls.

536
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,100
You still need
to prove your loyalty.

537
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,600
We want nate archibald.

538
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,800
We know you're tight with him.
We know he's on campus.

539
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,900
- Archibald's
not worth your time.
- We think he is.

540
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,100
My family lost our compound
in newport because of his father.

541
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,100
Pull him in. Take him down.

542
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,200
You've got one hour.

543
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,600
If you want in,
you'll bring u bibald.

544
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,300
<i>- Ment-Vous
les fis du lelouch?
- Oh, j'adore lelouch.</i>

545
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,800
<i>"Roman de gare" 'tait un de
mes films préférés cet année.</i>

546
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,900
<i>Et toi?</i>

547
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,800
<i>Actually, it's "vous,"
as a sign of respect.</i>

548
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,900
I'm sure that's why
you don't know it very well.

549
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,600
- Blair waldorf.
- Enchant?Mademois

550
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,300
You were
re father's favorite teachl-.

551
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,100
I've b(#oking for you.

552
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,400
You inspired
his expatriation to france.

553
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,300
<i>I'd love for youto hear about
oh, oui.</i>

554
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,100
Where have you been?

555
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,100
I got tied up.

556
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,500
Hey, look. You wouldn't want
to lea tonight, would you?

557
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,700
I mean, i think i am completely
done with this place.

558
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,200
- Did you strike out?
- More like abruptly thrown out.

559
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,000
People here know who i am. They
know all the stuff about my dad.

560
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,300
Plus, there was this whole thing
with dan humphrey.

561
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,700
Well, i'd love to say, "tell
but since i can't,

562
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,800
Why don't we just meet up
and get blazed?

563
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,500
Yeah, yeah, okay.

564
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,700
Look. There's this
placef campus called

565
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,700
I'll meet 8ere.

566
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,900
??? Put.

567
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,100
Perfect.

568
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,800
It's done. Let's go.

569
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,300
Although i love henry viii,
i prefer sir thomas more.

570
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,100
I think it's great that pope benedict
canonized him when he did.

571
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,000
Oh, thank you.
Don't you mean pope pius xi?

572
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,100
That's quite right, miss, uh...
van der woodsen.

573
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,500
- Van der woodsen, is it?
- Hi.

574
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,700
- Most people don't know
their popes in succession.
- Oh.

575
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,500
- Excuse me.
- Can i borrow you
for a minute?

576
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,700
How do you even know that?
Yot through history class last year.

577
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,100
I love "the tudors."
Henry cavill is a total babe.

578
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,600
You look pretty calm for someone who no longer
has the perfect answer to the dean's question.

579
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,300
You don't think i came all the way
here without a backup answer, do you?

580
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,000
Oh, and it's a real
crowd-Pleaser. It's gonna kill.

581
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,000
Everyone. Everyone.

582
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,500
It's time for my favorite part
of the evening,

583
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,900
<i>Which has delightfully become
known over the years as probatur.</i>

584
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,500
That's latin for "the quiz."

585
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,900
We will begin
with mr. Applebaum.

586
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,500
Whoa. Hey.

587
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,800
Hey! Whoa!

588
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,300
Go hey! Aah!

589
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,500
Hey! A

590
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,200
And now
on to miss... steinberg.

591
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,700
Your answer is artemis.

592
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,700
Artemis is the goddess
of the forests and the hills.

593
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,000
As a freegan, i believe in all living
things being equal to all people.

594
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,600
I'm so glad
they did this alphabetically,

595
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,600
'Cause now i get to see
the look on your face

596
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,200
When i use your answer
even sooner.

597
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,400
I can tell you right now,???

598
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,000
...and also screw the man
at the same time.

599
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Very nice, miss steinberg.

600
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,300
Uh, now on to
miss van der woodsen.

601
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,400
The person you would most like
to have dinner with, real or imagined,

602
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,900
Living or dead is...

603
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,100
Pete fairman.

604
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,000
Uh...

605
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,800
I do not know this person.
Who is pete fairman?

606
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,300
Um...

607
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,700
He, uh, he...

608
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,000
He's..

609
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,700
He's the man she killed.

610
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,300
???

611
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,300
Why? It's not like
you don't deserve it.

612
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,100
Miss van der woodsen,
would you like to, uh, explain?

613
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,800
No, of course, dean berube.

614
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,300
Um, pete fairman was
a man that i knew.

615
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,900
- Man/dealer.
- Miss waldorf, let her speak.

616
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,100
He died almost two years ago
when i was with him.

617
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,900
What happened was a tragedy,

618
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,400
And i am filled with
regret over it,

619
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,500
- But i was not responsible--
- Were you responsible
for the sex tape?

620
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,900
- Blair.
- It wasn't very sexy,
if you ask me.

621
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,300
Blair, that's enough. Let's go.
Dean berube, do you mind if we, um,

622
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,900
Sort this out
privately, please?

623
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,700
Take all the time you need.

624
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,600
My answer was george sand.

625
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,200
Love her, idolize, worship!

626
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,800
Get your hands off of me!
Or are you trying to kill me, too?

627
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,400
A guy died, and you use it
as part of a game. Who does that?

628
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,600
It isn't a game, and this isn't just
anotus thing on a laundry list.

629
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,100
This is yale, my dream.
You crossed the line.

630
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,200
And so did you ???

631
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,000
As far as my being here, you
take that up with the school.

632
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,400
You did not just dirthat.

633
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,000
Why did you think
you were invited?

634
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,900
You know on paper
you're not yale material.

635
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Could it be your face
on "page six,"???

636
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,600
Yale needs
to up their "q" rating,

637
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,700
Just like
all the other schools,

638
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,600
And they're gonna use
girls like you to do it.

639
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,800
You shut up!

640
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,900
You shut up!

641
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,100
Aah! No!

642
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,800
Blair!

643
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,200
- And i reallye
those stupid headbands.
- Aah! My headband!

644
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,100
Aah!

645
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,100
You--Aah!

646
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,900
No! You!

647
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,600
Oh! Aah!

648
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,800
Are you sure it's okay for us
to just come up here like this?

649
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,600
Yeah. The maid's expecting me.
Larissa?

650
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,700
Whose maid
is larse exactly?

651
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,600
You didn't say
where we were going.

652
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,100
- Jenny.
- Lily's not here.
I didn't think you'd mind.

653
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,000
Rufus.

654
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,300
Whoa.

655
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,200
Oh, um...

656
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,500
This is not my d.

657
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,100
I was just trying it on...
for fun.

658
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,200
Sorry. When i called, um,

659
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,000
Larissa said were going out tonight,
and i could leave this with her.

660
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,400
<i>I forgot to include it in the
garment bag with your dress.</i>

661
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,700
Oh.

662
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,600
But clearly, um,

663
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,000
I don't even think
you need it.

664
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,200
Uh, this dress
looks so great on you.

665
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,900
The only thing wrong
is the shoes.

666
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,300
I can totally go pick you out
a different pair if you want.

667
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,000
Oh, upstairs,
third door on the left.

668
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,500
Okay.

669
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,000
How have you been?

670
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,600
Fine. Sorry for the intrusion.

671
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,100
Oh. It's no bogo.
I'm always happy to see you.

672
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,400
Uh...

673
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
The house seems quiet.

674
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,800
Well, bart is out of town,

675
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,800
Serena and charles are
on college visits,

676
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,800
And eric has a new friend,
so i hear.

677
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,400
Well, the place looks amazing,
azas do you.

678
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
It's quite a dress.

679
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,100
Of course it is.

680
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,100
Your daughter made it.

681
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,600
You're so lucky

682
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,800
To have a daughter that's this good

683
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,700
At what she wants to do
so early in her life.

684
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,600
It's a gift.

685
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,100
You had one, too,
if i remember correctly.

686
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,200
Here you go. The p(#ct pair
of jimmy choos.

687
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,000
Mm. I will lend these to serena
when she wears the dress.

688
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,700
Okay.

689
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,200
- Jenny, we should get going.
- Okay. See you.

690
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,400
Bye.

691
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,900
By the way,

692
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,800
No matter what you wear,

693
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,400
You look fantastic.

694
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,100
Hey, man. Where are you?

695
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,900
I've been sitting here forever.
Please, just call me back.

696
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,100
- A round of shots, mike.
- Coming right up, guys.

697
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,700
We just taught nate archibald
a lesson,

698
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,900
And he'll never
come back to yale.

699
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,500
Yeah, archibald's such a loser.

700
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,300
Excuse me.
Did you say "nate archibald"?

701
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah, we just tied that chump
to the statue in the gazebo.

702
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,100
- It's priceless.
- I hope he freezes his ass off.

703
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,500
Well, you got the wrong guy.

704
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,900
<i>I'm nate archibald,</i>

705
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,200
And i look forward to coming here
next year and kicking your ass.

706
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,700
In fact, why wait?

707
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,200
- Okay, it can wait.
- Go! Get him!

708
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,100
- Come on!
- Get him!

709
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,800
Hey, excuse me.
Excuse me. Uh, hi.

710
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,500
Um, i know this is a strange
request, but could you untie me?

711
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,400
Sir. Hey. Yeah.
Hey. Come on. Hey. Excuse me.

712
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,400
Would you be so kind
as to, uh...

713
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,900
Dan?

714
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,200
I hope you at least bought
the statue a drink first.

715
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,200
No, you know, i don't know
want you to help me.

716
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,400
Well, you might, if you knew
that the only you're here

717
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,600
Is because they
thought you were me.

718
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,400
How is ??? I-I didn't lie about my name.

719
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,600
Yeah, but i have a feeling
someone else did for you.

720
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,000
Why would anyone want to hurt,
uh, ipperfect nate archibald?

721
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,700
Apparently my legacy at yale involves
a lot of people hating my father's guts.

722
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,300
Urns out he killed
a few trust funds around here.

723
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,700
- By tir,
this knot is ridiculous.
- Yeah, i know.

724
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,100
Could you, uh, could you
try a little faster?

725
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,800
'Cause i see something
approaching that looks female.

726
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,200
I'm not entirely proud
of my choice of boxers.

727
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,200
You two again?

728
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,100
- Yeah.
- Hi.

729
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,500
Is this performance art piece your
new plan to get my attention?

730
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,800
Uh, w-Would--
Would it work if it was?

731
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,200
Move over.
My mom was in the navy.

732
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,600
Oh, my god.

733
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,200
I can't do it anymore, blair.

734
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
That's because
you almost lost.

735
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,100
I had you pinned with that
chicken wing. Don't deny it.

736
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,500
I don't mean this.
I mean everything--

737
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,400
The wars, the betrayal,

738
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,900
The watching out
for every possible land mine.

739
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,000
- It's exhausting.
- I'm sick of it, too.

740
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,700
I'm sick of always
looking like darth vader

741
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,000
Next to sunshine barbie.

742
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,000
Life's too short.

743
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,700
???

744
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,700
Well, if that's
how we really feel, may--

745
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,600
Maybe we shouldn't
be friends.

746
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,100
We were probably gonna
grow apart in college anyway,

747
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,600
So we might as well
just start now, right?

748
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,100
Fine by me.

749
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,700
You live your life.
I'll live mine.

750
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,000
Sounds great.

751
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,400
I agree.

752
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,600
<i>From comrades to combat,
we thought we'd seen it all,</i>

753
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,300
<i>But we've never seen this--</i>

754
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,200
<i>Serena and blair
calling a cease-Fire.</i>

755
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:57,100
<i>After so much scorched earth,
can either side claim victory?</i>

756
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,400
Why do i feel like you're gonna
tell me the cat died?

757
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,100
No, no. It's nothing bad.

758
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,700
Uh, when i was your age, all i
wanted was to be a musician,

759
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,900
But my parents didn't think
it was a good idea,

760
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,900
And it made for some
pretty uncomfortable years.

761
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,400
And last night,
i realized that--

762
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,200
That we don't have
to do things that way.

763
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,400
I don't understand.

764
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,100
Your dad asked me to bring over
all my stuff on homeschooling.

765
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,200
Aah!

766
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,500
After christmas,
we can reevaluate.

767
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,300
??? To the professional children's
school for next semester.

768
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,200
Like vera wang. Aah!

769
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,500
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

770
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,500
I won't let you down.
I promise.

771
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,200
I know you won't.

772
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,500
What are you doing here,

773
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,500
Making sure the dean knows
it's all mult?

774
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,200
No.

775
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
I came to tell him
that yale is your dream,

776
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,400
And you deserve
to ghere more than i do.

777
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,500
What are you doing here?

778
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,700
Doing the same thing
for you.

779
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,400
I was up all night
thinking about

780
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,100
The first time we came here
together when we were 9.

781
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,600
Your dad took us
to that harvard/yale game,

782
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,900
And you tackled
senator schumer's daughter

783
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,300
For wearing
a harvard swtshirt.

784
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,800
I bet those grass stains
never came out.

785
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,100
I don't want
g ot know you.

786
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,100
I can't not know you.

787
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,500
Maybe we just had that fht because

788
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,500
The reality of being
separated next year

789
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,500
Is just too scary
to think about.

790
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,800
So?

791
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,700
Wait here for me.

792
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,900
We'll ride home together.

793
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,400
Okay.

794
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,400
So you think you can, uh,
maybe help him out a bit?

795
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,100
Well, i can't promise anything,

796
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,300
But i'm pretty se i can get
someone in the department...

797
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,800
- Ooh!
- To read these and write
you a recommendation.

798
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,800
Yes. Thank you so much, really.
It's so nice to know

799
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,100
That my dream of going to yale
isn't dead.

800
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,000
It might be, uh, embarrassed
and humiliated, but not dead.

801
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,000
And i'm sorry i just needed to be
someone else for a while.

802
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,000
Yeahssll, next time you're up here,
why don't you just be yourself?

803
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,800
- Okay.
- Yeah.

804
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,000
I would have liked you
whatever your name was.

805
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,100
- Bye, dan.
- Bye. You know what?

806
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,100
- You--You do dan humphrey
better than dan humphrey.
- Really?

807
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,100
That, uh, that thousand yard
squint--Can i steal that?

808
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,200
Well, thank you.

809
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,300
Here he is.

810
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
It looks like someone
messed up last night.

811
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,800
You sent us
after the wrong guy.

812
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,700
He may have been??? But he was
the right guy for me.

813
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,600
You'll pay for this???

814
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,200
Oh, i'm not coming here
next fall.

815
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,500
Those girls i brought
to the party last night?

816
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,400
They witnessed some pretty incriminating
acts with their lipstick cameras.

817
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,700
You may be the future
leaders of america.

818
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,900
You're now under the control
of chuck bass.

819
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,900
I own you.

820
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,600
Keep it.
I've got plenty.

821
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,300
Missed you last night.

822
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,100
Did you?

823
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,500
Or was it your plan all along
just to get me out of the way?

824
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
- What?
- I know what you did.

825
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,000
You should be glad. Those guys were
coming for you. Saved your ass.

826
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,200
You didn't have
to send them after dan.

827
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,300
Two birds, one stone.
Seemed good to me.

828
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,100
Besides, since when do you care
about humdrum humphrey anyway?

829
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,100
He's nothing.

830
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,300
- He's less than nothing.
- I actually think ???

831
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,900
We'll talk about this
in the car.

832
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,600
No, i think--I think ???

833
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,500
So the dean seemed inscrutable
to you, too?

834
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,200
I don't think he even blinked.

835
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,900
Well, since we're probably both gonna
end up at hunter after what happened,

836
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,100
I think we ought to say
a proper good-Bye.

837
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,300
- Hello?
- Serena, dean berube.

838
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Oh, hello, sir.

839
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,500
I just thought you should know that

840
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
Despite events
at last night's reception,

841
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,000
I-I remain most impressed
with you,

842
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,000
And come time for
early acceptances in december,

843
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,800
Gd check that list to see
if your name was on it.

844
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,900
Okay, but what about blair?

845
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,900
Well, like all the other students
with blair's qualifications,

846
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,100
She wi learn her fate
in the spring.

847
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,400
If it's all right with you, i'd
like to issue a press release

848
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,400
That you came up
to visit our glorious campus.

849
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,600
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

850
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,900
I won't accept.
I can't, like this.

851
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,100
What? No, you have to.

852
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,600
It doesn't matter
how you got it or why.

853
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,500
It's an opportunity.

854
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,600
No, you're my best friend.
What's mine is yours.

855
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,300
You can't share this.

856
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,100
???

857
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,800
<i>Dreams--Everybody has them--</i>
