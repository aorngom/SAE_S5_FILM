1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,700
(Gossip girl) gossip girl
here-Your one and only source

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:05,300
Into the scandalous lives
of manhattan's elite.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,700
You're the guy who gave us our first
joint, snuck us into our first club.

4
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:12,800
I'm in this weekly game- High
stakes, big mey.. You set me up.

5
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:15,667
No one forced his hand. Your
boy lost fair and square.

6
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:18,465
I know who blair and those
girls are, but i know who i am,

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,300
And i'm not gonna forget that
just 'cause i hang out with them.

8
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:21,967
You're dismissed, jenny,be good.

9
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:23,951
(Rufus) i'm sorry i kissed you.

10
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:26,093
Your mother must have been?

11
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:28,165
Yeah, she was. Hi, rufus.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,600
If she's in your life, you're
never gonna get over her.

13
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:33,000
You should deal with your
father. He needs you. I don't.

14
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:34,867
We broke up, okay?

15
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,665
I like
you-Only you.

16
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,800
That's good, because i
feel the same about you.

17
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:42,265
-Do you like me?
-(Chuck) define "like. "

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,600
Tell me you didn sleep
with chuck for revenge.

19
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:47,400
Well, it wasn't because
i like his natural musk.

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,700
And who am i?

21
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,300
That's a secret i'll never tell.

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,900
You know you love me.

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,600
X.O.X.O., gossip girl.

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,600
Hey, upper east siders,
it's that time of year again,

25
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,700
When the mere act of
descending a staircase

26
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:10,965
Means you're a woman.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,600
That's
right-Debutante season.

28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm actually glad i'm going with
prince theodore instead of nate.

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,650
The further we get from the breakup,

30
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:26,092
The more self-Involved i see he was.

31
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,500
Always so brooding, so tortured. Ugh.

32
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:31,100
A girl wants romeo, not hamlet.

33
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:32,165
Romeo died.

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,265
Yeah, but he died for
something exciting,

35
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,900
And i want my debutante ball
to be something to die for.

36
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,100
Hey, so, uh, has blair
mentioned who's escorting her?

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,100
Why? Are you having remorse
sex fantasies about your ex?

38
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,000
What? No.

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,800
Don't eff with an
effer. I know that look.

40
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,065
No, man, it's just every
time i see her lately,

41
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,600
Something's different. You know,
she's lighter. She's happier.

42
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,465
(Sighs) she's just-
Less-Less blair.

43
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,950
She does have a certain
glow about her, doesn't she?

44
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:02,400
I don't understand why
you don't get this, okay?

45
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,400
A debutante ball is all
a girl could ask for.

46
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:08,417
It's gorgeous and formal
and totally legendary.

47
00:02:08,452 --> 00:02:11,365
Don't forget out of touch
and totally classist.

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,100
And if that's how you feel,
then why are you even going?

49
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:14,965
I'm not going and neither
is serena, actually.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
I'm just going to meet her
grandmother to make a good impression,

51
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,200
And, uh, take off before i put my
foot in my mouth, like i usually do.

52
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:24,400
All i get with nate is some
ros? In the back of a town car,

53
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,365
But with the prince,
i get a security detail

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,900
And a high-Speed chase to
the pierre after it's over.

55
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:31,400
Ooh! I can see you on the
cover of "hello!" Already.

56
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:33,700
Yeah, well,?

57
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,665
They've chosen me for
"a night out with,"

58
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,450
And i'm gonna give them the most
perfect night out of the year.

59
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:42,200
With my dad in rehab, it's like
the pressure's finally off me.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
You know, i can see
blair clearly, and it's...

61
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,400
(Sighs) i don't know, man.
I think i might miss her.

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,900
(Scoffs) you don't miss her, man.

63
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,100
Is your mom mad that
you're not being presented?

64
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:55,865
Well, she doesn't really?

65
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,100
Since i found out she used to be
my boyfriend's father's biggest fan.

66
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:02,167
Yeah. Ew! It sounds so gross
when you say it out loud.

67
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:04,200
Silly me. Here i actually
thought you wanted to go.

68
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:05,965
Uh, i'm here with you,?

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,100
Yeah, only 'cause your
grandmother's meeting you here.

70
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:09,400
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,365
Oh! You're here! I'm so glad. Hey!

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
Oh! You're here! I'm so glad. Hey!

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,400
You're just gonna love
her. (Dan) i'm sure i will.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,300
Well, if you don't listen to me,
you're gonna hear it from her,

75
00:03:58,335 --> 00:04:01,017
And i promise, you don't
want that to happen.

76
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:03,700
The brands i listed are
the key to her happiness,

77
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:05,800
And that includes tanqueray.

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,900
Dan, jenny, it's so good to see you.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,765
Dan) hi. Hi.

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,300
Oh, hey, jenny, what
are you even doing here?

81
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, she loves these things, apparently.

82
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:16,265
Well, i wish serena did.

83
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,965
It would make my life
a whole lot easier.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,300
My grandma was the chairwoman
for this event for 15 years,

85
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:24,265
And now the committee's
asked my mom to join.

86
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,100
And my daughter could not
wait to go for ten years,

87
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:29,900
And then suddenly,
she's not even coming.

88
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
Jenny? Jenny?

89
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,500
Why don't you volunteer?

90
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,600
Uh, well, blair's lead deb,
and we're sort of on the outs.

91
00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:41,700
You know, i'm sure if she wanted
my help, she would've asked.

92
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:43,400
Well, i'm asking.

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,665
I mean, of course,

94
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,300
We'd have to get your
parents' permission first,

95
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:50,965
But, um, we could use more help.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,700
I'm sure it'll be fine.
Um, see you saturday.

97
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:55,400
Oh, actually, it's sunday.

98
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:58,000
Uh... can i call you?

99
00:04:58,035 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay.

100
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,300
Ah! There is my
magnificent granddaughter.

101
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:08,600
(Gasps) grandma. Oh! (Laughing)

102
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,700
Oh, hello, mother.

103
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,600
Is there a bar in this place?

104
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,465
(Gasps) no!

105
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,000
I should've known i had
to bring the party myself.

106
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,165
So this must be daniel.

107
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,165
Dan, actually. Dan humphrey. Yeah. Hi.

108
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,365
My granddaughter told me
that you were delighted

109
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,900
When she decededuh, not to
make her debut this weekend?

110
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:34,300
Yeah, go ahead. Tell her what you think.

111
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,000
Grandma loves honesty. It's okay.

112
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,200
Well, cotillions just
seem antiquated to me.

113
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:41,100
You know, remnant of a different age.

114
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:43,065
Well, do go on.

115
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,850
People spend all this money
to have their daughters

116
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:46,600
Basically dance in front
of others for attention.

117
00:05:46,635 --> 00:05:48,365
Uh, when, if you ask serena,

118
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,700
I bet she'd do that for you
right now, free of charge.

119
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:52,965
The cotillion?

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,165
That women should always
have in their arsenal.

121
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,100
I think serena's graces are
pretty spectacular as they are.

122
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,565
Oh, besides, grandma,

123
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
You haven't used your
graces in a while, rith

124
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:03,500
Oh, you.

125
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,565
(Laughs) oh, isn't she great?

126
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,100
She's... she's great. She's something.

127
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,000
Dan humphrey, was it?

128
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
Yes, mother.

129
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,800
You looked pretty hot on
princess theodore's arm today.

130
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:39,200
Oh, is that what i am to
you? Just an accessory?

131
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,700
(Chuckles) next to him, yes.

132
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,865
On me, you'd be so much more.

133
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,850
Yes, well, i can't be on you, remember?

134
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:49,800
Because you don't want nate to find out,

135
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:51,400
And i don't want anyone to,

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,200
But you'd have to learn how
to behave yourself first.

137
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,300
(Dorota) miss blair, mr. Nate for you.

138
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,400
What are you doing here, nate?

139
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,600
Well, i, um...

140
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,965
Look, you know, after rehearsal,

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,600
I just, uh, i couldn't
stop thinking about you.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,750
I mean, the ball's
something we've talked about

143
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:29,500
Doing together since we
were, like, 10 years old,

144
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,600
And i've given you
every reason to hate me.

145
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:35,000
True. Keep going.

146
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,400
And the prince-
He's, uh, you know,

147
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:38,900
He's a great dancer and all,

148
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
But is there any chance
you'd go with me instead,

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,300
For old times' sake?

150
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,765
Nate, after what you
pulled on my birthday,

151
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,100
The only thing we should be
doing together is moving on.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,800
Yeah, i know.

153
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,400
(Chuckles) look, i haven't worn
this sweater in, like, forever,

154
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,400
And i, uh, i just pulled it
out today, and i found this.

155
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,065
It's my pin.

156
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,900
I sewed it there so you'd always
have my heart on your sleeve.

157
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,400
(Chuckles) i know.

158
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,900
Yeah, i figured you might need
it back or something, if...

159
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,200
No, it was a gift.

160
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,000
The prince will understand.

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,800
Maybe we should go to
the ball together...

162
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
As friends.

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,765
Absolutely.

164
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,400
But only as friends.

165
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:32,500
Just friends.

166
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,000
Hey, dad.

167
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,800
Hey, sweetheart.

168
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,500
I sense a favor about to be asked.

169
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:44,700
It's just...

170
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,165
Oh.

171
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,165
Well, it turns out

172
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,100
I got a volunteer position at a charity.

173
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:50,600
That's great. Mm-Hmm.

174
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:51,400
When is it?

175
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,865
Sunday night, and i
know it's mom's opening,

176
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,800
And i know it's really
important, but i can do both.

177
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,165
As a family, we support each other.

178
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,565
And when one of us has
something important,

179
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,500
We all show up for it. Maybe
you can volunteer next year.

180
00:09:02,535 --> 00:09:03,800
Dad. Volunteer for what?

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Nothing, it doesn't matter
'cause dad said i can't go.

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,600
Hey, i, uh, went thrift store shopping,

183
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:15,065
And i found great stuff.

184
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,565
I got you some black vintage pumps.

185
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
They're gonna go perfectly with the
dress you're gonna wear for the opening.

186
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,300
(Scoffs) mom, the kids i go to
school with shop at saks and bendel's.

187
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:28,600
I can't be walking around
in someone's old shoes.

188
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,200
I know. It's gross.

189
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,865
Oh, that reminds me.

190
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,900
I still haven't shown you
pictures from my summer abroad.

191
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:43,965
Oh, yes.

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,800
(Squeals) be right back.

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,500
(Chuckles) well, i know you
must not be happy, mother.

194
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:52,400
I remember how unhappy
you were when i didn't go,

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,500
And i imagine you came all this
way to change serena's mind,

196
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:59,000
But she is intractable on this.

197
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,900
That's not the reason i came.

198
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,700
Everything okay?

199
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,100
Lily, my darling, the, uh...

200
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,500
The doctors think they found something.

201
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,600
Something?

202
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,000
What something?

203
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,800
Something in my lungs.

204
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,665
Oh, no. Mom.

205
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,465
Well, they're-
They're running tests,

206
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,800
But they said that, uh,
it might not be good.

207
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:24,065
Look, i-I didn't want to worry you.

208
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,000
I- I don't want to be
a burden to you. I...

209
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:28,900
Oh, no, it's no burden at all.

210
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,400
All i want to do is to see my
granddaughter make her debut

211
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:35,900
The way i did,

212
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,750
The way my mother did before me.

213
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:41,100
Oh, mother, anything for you.

214
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,800
What's going on?

215
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,300
Um, serena,

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
You're going to the debutante ball.

217
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:57,065
Serena van der woodsen,

218
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,500
Looks like your
invitation just arrived...

219
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,065
With strings attached.

220
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,300
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

221
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,965
Everything all right, mr. Archibald?

222
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,965
Oh, yes, everything's fine.
It's just my... my date-

223
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,300
She's never late, and, uh,
she likes to have finaapprpral.

224
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:13,300
Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry.

225
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,200
My cappuccino was decaf,
and i couldn't find my phone.

226
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:18,400
It took forever to get a cab.

227
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,900
But you live up the street.

228
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,900
I wasn't home.

229
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,500
Well, everything's taken care of.

230
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,300
I'll pick you up at 5:00 in the car.

231
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,400
I got that laurent-Perrier you like.

232
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,700
(Cell phone chirps) i also thought we'd
stop by the modern afterwards for dessert,

233
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,800
'Cause that's your favorite.

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,900
Blair.

235
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, um, we don't have to go
anywhere afterwards. It's fine.

236
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,500
Sorry. Who's texting you so much?

237
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,400
Serena.

238
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,465
Uh, i gotta go back to my house.

239
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,865
My mom was supposed to throw this tea

240
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,700
For serena's grandmother,
and she had to jet to paris

241
00:11:56,735 --> 00:11:57,865
At the last minute, so it's all on me.

242
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,100
Okay, hey, uh, w-I'll
stop by and help you out.

243
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:01,800
It's all right.?

244
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Who are you, and what did
you do with blair waldorf?

245
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,000
Not bad, archibald.

246
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,400
I almost forgot how handsome you are.

247
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,965
Spotted- Nate
archibald learning

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,300
You don't know a good
thing till it's gone

249
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,400
And found someone else.

250
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,900
So your mom really didn't
mind your coming to, um,

251
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:31,900
Our ball with... me?

252
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,365
No, not at all.

253
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,100
(Lily) and your father is okay

254
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:36,800
With you volunteering as well?

255
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:38,900
Um, excuse me. Jenny.

256
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,500
Alison.

257
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,800
Ah. Didn't expect to see you... here.

258
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,065
(Chuckles) that's me, unexpected.

259
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,800
Um, mom, can i talk to you for a minute?

260
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,400
Uh, no, sweetie, we'll have?

261
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,800
You know what? It is so nice of you

262
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:56,865
To let jenny come to our little event.

263
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,350
You know, cotillions
really are instructive.

264
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:01,800
They teach young girls
good social graces...

265
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:03,500
Well, then i'm sure she'll learn a lot.

266
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm gonna go. Um, i'll come with you.

267
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:09,400
No need. I'll see you later.

268
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,165
Thank you so much for
being so understanding.

269
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,800
Oh, come on. I would do
anything for an ill grandparent,

270
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,565
And besides, my mom has her art opening,

271
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,565
So we're both doing
things for our families.

272
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,765
Well, my thing isn't without
conditions, believe me.

273
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,300
I had a long talk with my mom,
and i said if i'm gonna do this,

274
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:38,665
Then i'm gonna be myself
in every possible way.

275
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,400
Well, then can you promise me being
yourself as they auction you off,

276
00:13:41,435 --> 00:13:44,100
That you won't go for anything
less than a million dollars?

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay. Did you get that out of your
system? Yeah, i think i'm good.

278
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,200
Grandma. Serena, darling,
this is carter baizen,

279
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,900
Your escort for tomorrow night.

280
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Do you two already know each
other? Actually, we used?

281
00:14:01,235 --> 00:14:02,900
Just a couple years apart. (Cece) oh.

282
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,065
Hi. I'm carter.

283
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,565
This is daniel humphrey. Dan, actually.

284
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,200
Serena's friend. (Serena)
no, my-My boyfriend.

285
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Oh, nice to meet you,
man. Nice to meet you.

286
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,900
I'm sorry. You're not-
You're not escorting her or...

287
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:15,865
No, well,
actually, i'm-

288
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,800
Unavailable. Familial obligation.

289
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,865
Yeah. There you are.
Are you ready for tea?

290
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't like my ice to get
lonely, dear. (Ice cubes rattling)

291
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:25,065
(Woman) of course, ma'am.

292
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,000
Carter, it is such a pleasure
to have you back with us.

293
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,167
True gentlemen are a rare breed.

294
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,151
So it is true that you're back.

295
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:34,100
Back? Um,
where-Where were you?

296
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:35,265
(Kati) oh, where wasn't he?

297
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,200
He disowned his parents and
took off around the world.

298
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:38,365
Everyone?

299
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,600
Gossip girl even had a dedicated
carter baizen map on "spotted. "

300
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,565
Whoa. A map, huh?

301
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,500
In all honesty, i did go
a little out of bounds.

302
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,900
I'm just grateful my parents
are giving me a second chance.

303
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:53,165
Carter saw the error
of his wayward ways,

304
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,200
And he rose ke a phoenix
from the ashes, serena.

305
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,765
Yes, i see that, grandma.

306
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,700
I mean, they weren't all errors, but...

307
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,900
Well, your mother did tell me
that you got into a bit of a-

308
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,065
Ahem-A scrape
in dubai.

309
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,900
Oh, i love dubai. Did you
stay at the burj al arab?

310
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,900
No, i stayed on palm island.

311
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,400
I think dubai is overrated.

312
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:13,565
You know what isn't, though?

313
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,465
The, uh, prince's crown bombardier.

314
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,000
And i also went pheasant
hunting with the sheikh

315
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:18,900
While i was there.

316
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,300
I kept the tags.

317
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,900
I'll return everything tomorrow.

318
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,200
Look...

319
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,800
I know that my coming
back has been rocky...

320
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,865
But i can't keep being afraid

321
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,165
That if i act more like your mother

322
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,600
And less like your friend,
that i'm gonna lose you.

323
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,200
If you were still in
hudson, i'd be able to go.

324
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,065
Well, i am not there. I am here,

325
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,750
And i don't really care if
that makeyou happy or unhappy.

326
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:01,400
I'm still your mother. You
can come to my show tomorrow,

327
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:03,200
And then you are grounded for a week.

328
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
What?!

329
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,000
Come on, mom. That's so unfair!

330
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
I just don't get it. I organized
everything the way she likes it.

331
00:16:11,635 --> 00:16:15,100
I mean, i even made sure my
bow tie matched her dress.

332
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:17,200
Like the book says, she
just not that into you.

333
00:16:17,235 --> 00:16:20,200
Man, i have to find
out?It's killing me.

334
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,500
You guys are still
pretty close, aren't you?

335
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,000
Uh, yeah.

336
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,900
Could you find out who she's seeing? Me?

337
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:29,500
Yes. Come on, man. Whbetter?

338
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
Who better, indeed.

339
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,800
Do you like it here, mr. Humphrey?

340
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,600
Well, it's a little bit
like a museum, a little cold,

341
00:16:46,635 --> 00:16:48,600
Although the water
pressure is unparalleled.

342
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:50,465
That's not what i meant, but of course,

343
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,900
You would make a joke,
that goes to my point.

344
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,700
Excuse me? Did i miss something here?

345
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:57,700
Oh, yes. The way you feel?

346
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,100
It never goes away.

347
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,765
It just gets worse.

348
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,965
I'm sorry. I
don't quite-

349
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,065
You'll always use your
dessert fork for your entrée.

350
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,350
You'll always feel underdressed,
no matter what you wear,

351
00:17:09,385 --> 00:17:12,600
And at dinner parties, it will
be as if there's a language

352
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:15,917
That sounds like english,
and you think you speak it,

353
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:19,200
But they don't hear you, and
you don't understand them.

354
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,300
As time passes, you'll feel
that people never see you

355
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,500
When they look at you

356
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,965
Or her... charity case,

357
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,600
Until the day comes when you
realize that girls like serena

358
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:37,200
Don't end up with dan humphrey.

359
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,000
They end up with the
carters of the world,

360
00:17:39,035 --> 00:17:41,065
And, um, people
like you-

361
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,300
They turn into cocktail party anecdotes

362
00:17:44,335 --> 00:17:46,200
Of their foolish youth.

363
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,000
So why don't you, uh, give it up

364
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:54,400
And spare yourself the pain, hmm?

365
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,200
I'm sure serena will understand.

366
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,650
This just in-We hear
there's a cold war brewing

367
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:02,992
Between lonely boy and
a certain blue blood.

368
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:05,300
We never thought we'd
say this ourselves...

369
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,117
There you are. What's going on?

370
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,865
I'll tell you what's going on.

371
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,100
I just became your escort to the ball.

372
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,900
But our money's on brooklyn for the win.

373
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,365
Thanks so much for
your time, miss waldorf.

374
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,600
I guess i'll see you and the prince
later tonight. Uh, actually, i'm not going

375
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:26,317
I'm going with nate archibald. Ah.

376
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:27,965
Given our history, it was only right.

377
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,900
He is the perfect
gentleman, the perfect date.

378
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:33,867
Chuck bass. Hi. John
mayberry. "New york times. "

379
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:36,800
I'd just like to say how
proud i am of miss waldorf

380
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:38,765
And her commitment to mr. Archibald,

381
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,900
Even though he ruined her
17th birthday and slept with-

382
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,900
Thank you. That was
great, right? Take care.

383
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:47,400
All right. Have a good one.

384
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,500
What was that? I should
ask you the same question.

385
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:54,517
"Perfect gentleman"? "Perfect date"?

386
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:56,465
That broken record was a hit last year.

387
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Get with the times. He bores y..
You almost made a fool of me in

388
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,750
Which proves my very
point- You can't be trusted.

389
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:06,600
Nate is a gentleman. He
would never cause a scene.

390
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:08,165
Never get your blood going either.

391
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,100
Speaking of going,
that's what you should do.

392
00:19:10,135 --> 00:19:11,965
Carter baizen is on
his way here right now.

393
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,500
What? What the hell are you doing
with carter baizen? He left his jacket

394
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:18,000
And i'd rather you be
gone when he got here.

395
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,400
There's been enough scenes for today.

396
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,200
So i s it's true what they say
about the apple and the tree.

397
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,400
Hello, celia. I'd say
it's nice to see you,

398
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:39,565
But i know how you hate dishonesty.

399
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,400
It appears that your son
is taking my granddaughter

400
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:43,500
To the ball tonight.

401
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,865
He is?

402
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,700
I'd rather see that not happen.

403
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,100
There's no point in being
presented if it's improperly,

404
00:19:51,135 --> 00:19:54,700
And your daniel is
not a proper companion

405
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,265
For a girl like serena.

406
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,700
He's a, um, temporary distraction.

407
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,000
I need her to focus on heruture.

408
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Hers or yours?

409
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,900
I am willing to purchase all
the paintings in this gallery

410
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:13,965
In exchange for you

411
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,100
Convincing your son
not to accompany serena.

412
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,365
Before you answer, remember,

413
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,500
A grown man with children is
in a very different position

414
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:24,500
Than a young man.

415
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,600
The money could be useful now.

416
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,800
Not to mention, how
much this sale would mean

417
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:31,800
To your wife's career as an artist.

418
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,500
Your money was no good for me then,

419
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,500
And it's still no good with me now.

420
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,300
And you can rest assured that like me,

421
00:20:44,335 --> 00:20:45,700
My son can't be bought.

422
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,065
And i can assure you,

423
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,900
Just like her mother,
my granddaughter can be.

424
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,065
What do you mean?

425
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,965
All those years ago, i told lily

426
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,100
To choose between you
and her inheritance.

427
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,250
I'd tell you the end of that story,

428
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:02,300
But i think you know it by heart.

429
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,865
You're a little
overdressed for an art show,

430
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,150
Don't you think? Dad, listen.
Um, i've been meaning to tell you.

431
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:20,400
I'm sorry. Don't worry about
your mom. I'll take care of it.

432
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:22,100
You don't mind? (Sighs)

433
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,165
I thought i'd be grounded
when you found out,

434
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,500
Just like jenny was. I gotta
admit, it would be worth it.

435
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:29,865
I don't mind at all. Yeah.

436
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,865
Tux looks great. Shoes look great.

437
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,000
You look so great. You're
gonna make me proud.

438
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,300
Show that celia rhodes what
us humphrey men are made of.

439
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,250
What's going on here, dad?
You're-You're doing that thing

440
00:21:41,285 --> 00:21:43,100
Again where you're acting
really weird for no reason.

441
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,265
It's kind of freaking me out.

442
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Oh, uh, serena's grandmother
just came to see me.

443
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,900
Um, we need to talk.

444
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,900
Have you seen serena's
presentation statement?

445
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:04,065
Wants to take a year off of school,

446
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,365
Teach english in south asia?
This simply won't suffice.

447
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Well, what do you want me to do
about it? Well, if serena's doing this

448
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,500
Besides, it took me years
to restore our family name

449
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:15,765
After your exploits.

450
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,300
Trust me, you don't want to do the same.

451
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,465
Hello?

452
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,865
Hey, volunteer. Where are you?

453
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,465
You were supposed to be
here a half an hour ago.

454
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Oh, um, didn't your mom tell you i'm not
coming anymore? What? I don't understand.

455
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,765
I thought that this
was, like, your dream.

456
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,600
Besides, don't you want to
see your brother in a tux?

457
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:49,865
Wait. What? You know,

458
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,865
Your brother dan- The
guy who thinks dancing

459
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,400
Is making fists and pumping 'em into
the air? Dan's going to the ball?

460
00:22:55,435 --> 00:22:58,300
Yeah, it-It was just
a last minute thing.

461
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm sure he just forgot to tell you.

462
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:02,200
Um, i'm on my way.

463
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,200
Hey!

464
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,200
W- Wow. You look incredible.

465
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,200
Thank you.

466
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,200
You're early.

467
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,565
Well, uh, yeah, we
need to talk. What's up?

468
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,400
Is your grandmother here? Where is
she? Oh, yeah, she's in the other

469
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:53,700
Why? I gotta be honest
about something here.

470
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,665
Um, i don't think your grandmother

471
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,765
Is who you think she is.
What are you talking about?

472
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,700
I know she's got the whole free
spirit act perfected... act?

473
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:06,100
But i don't think she has
your best interests at heart.

474
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,900
Where are you going with
this, dan? She came by

475
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,700
Well, she probably just wanted to
see your mom's art. No, she was trying

476
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:18,200
So i wouldn't go with you
tonight. No, she wouldn't

477
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:20,567
Serena, that's what
i'm trying to tell you.

478
00:24:20,602 --> 00:24:22,900
That woman is the most
manipulative person

479
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:24,000
I've ever met.

480
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,000
She makes your-Your
mother look like gandhi.

481
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,200
That's my grandmother you're
talking about. I love her.

482
00:24:31,235 --> 00:24:33,617
I know. I know, and i'm so sorry,

483
00:24:33,652 --> 00:24:35,965
But maybe you love her so much

484
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,400
That you can't see what she's doing.

485
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,500
(Sighs) i said it. There.

486
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,100
Mae we s suldn't be doing this.

487
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Maybe we shouldn't.

488
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,000
Um... i'll just talk to you later.

489
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,700
Let's get carter on the phone.

490
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,900
Yeah.

491
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,665
(Nate) carter baizen's dating blair?

492
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,600
He's got everyone fooled.
Blair thinks he's reformed.

493
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,300
He's obviously just toying
with her to get at you.

494
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:39,565
Yeah, well, it's working.

495
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,400
We just need to wait until we
can get him in a public place,

496
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Where everyone who thinks
he's changed can see the truth,

497
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,500
And we can get him back for
everything he's done to you

498
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,500
And everything he's doing to blair.

499
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah, when's that gonna happen, huh?

500
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,500
Sir.

501
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,100
I have a feeling it may
be sooner than you think.

502
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,200
And one more, ladies. If
you don't pull it together,

503
00:26:17,235 --> 00:26:18,600
I'm gonna go naomi
campbell on you. (Sighs)

504
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,800
Maybe jenny can help you.
No, i'm fine. Thank you.

505
00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:25,365
Serena, uh, miss erlich needs to know

506
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,500
How to pronounce that word in
your presentation statement.

507
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,300
I assume it's a family name.

508
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,100
Hey. Beautiful. What's wrong? I
didn't write this. My mother did.

509
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,200
"Serena hopes to continue to
live on the upper east side,

510

511

And junior league and have two
wonderful children. " Let me see that.

512
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,100
(Blair) make it stop. You sound
like me. Serena, where'dadan?

513
00:26:46,135 --> 00:26:47,400
(Serena) he's not coming.

514
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,100
Here you go. Thanks.

515
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,300
What is he doing here?

516
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
(Chuck) carter's clever.

517
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,200
He's using serena as a
cover. It's not the time yet.

518
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,200
Nate, look, i was hoping to
see you. I wanted to apologize,

519
00:27:12,235 --> 00:27:13,965
Put the past in the past.

520
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,700
You don't get to say what goes on here.

521
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,300
I'm on to you.

522
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500

(Guests murmuring) (woman) oh, my god.

545
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,600

(Woman) here you go. Thanks.

550
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,400
You're back. What happened?

551
00:29:05,435 --> 00:29:07,200
Uh, cece won.

552
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,265
She has a habit of doing that,

553
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,400
But maybe it's for the best.
You're here with your family.

554
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,800
(Man) * you don't know
what's right anymore *

555
00:29:14,835 --> 00:29:17,300
Hey. Where's jenny? Have you seen her?

556
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:18,965
Actually, uh, no.

557
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,350
She's probably still upset
with me for grounding her

558
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,642
And is trying to teach
me a lesson. I don't know.

559
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:25,900
Maybe let her be ten minutes
late before you get mad?

560
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Mom, this looks great. All of this is
beautiful. Thank you. Come on. Tour.

561
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,150
Okay.

562
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:34,065
Let's go.

563
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,600
(The pierces) * got a
secret, can you keep it? *

564
00:29:36,635 --> 00:29:39,267
* swear this one you'll save *

565
00:29:39,302 --> 00:29:41,701
* better lock it in your pocket *

566
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:44,065
* taking this one to the grave *

567
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,000
* if i show you, then i
know you won't tell... *

568
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:48,965
What's going on?

569
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,200
* 'cause two can keep a secret *

570
00:29:51,235 --> 00:29:53,665
Hmm? Nothing.

571
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,550
* got a secret, can you keep it? *

572
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:59,365
* swear this one you'll save *

573
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,300
We're friends now,
right? You can tell me.

574
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:03,965
* taking this one to the grave *

575
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
* if i show you, then i know
you won't tell what i said *

576
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,300
* 'cause two can keep a
secret if one of them is dead *

577
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,100
* got a secret, can you keep it? *

578
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:20,465
* swear this one you'll save *

579
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,600
And now for someone
with only one left foot.

580
00:30:22,635 --> 00:30:24,265
* taking this one to the grave *

581
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,600
He just told her what he's
going to do to her later.

582
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,450
* you won't tell what i said *

583
00:30:30,485 --> 00:30:31,942
They might not know who you are,

584
00:30:31,977 --> 00:30:33,400
But i sure as hell never forgot.

585
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,100
Nate, what are you doing?
(Nate) she's my girlfriend!

586
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
Oh, my god.

587
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,465
(Carter) get off me!
Ugh! They ripped my dress.

588
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,300
Take him outside. Let's get
out of here. Come on. Come on.

589
00:30:44,335 --> 00:30:46,065
You don't understand. It was
custom-Made. Blair, it's okay.

590
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,600
My mom is gonna be angry. Jenny!
Jenny, hey, hey, we need you. Please?

591
00:30:48,635 --> 00:30:50,565
I have to go. I have my mom's thing.

592
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,000
(Blair) jenny, fix my
dress, and all is forgiven.

593
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,465
Oh, you make a fool

594
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,865
Of the presenter,
then you start a brawl.

595
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,965
I mean, what's next,
serena? "Girls gone wild"?

596
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,265
Serena van der woodsen wants
to work for the junior league

597
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,300
And have two children? It's a society ball,
serena. You have to represent yourself well.

598
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,800
How is it representing
myself well if it's all lies?

599
00:31:13,835 --> 00:31:15,900
What happened to you
between our talk and now?

600
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,465
I did this because i knew

601
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,465
How important it was
for you and grandma,

602
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,600
And you said that if i
did it, i could be myself.

603
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,165
You don't really want that, do you?

604
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,400
No, it's not entirely true. All you
care about when people look at me

605
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,400
Is what they think of you.

606
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,465
How am i supposed to accept myself

607
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,500
If my own mother doesn't
accept me? Oh, honey,

608
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,865
No.

609
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,700
No, you don't, but let
me tell you something.

610
00:31:46,735 --> 00:31:49,100
If i ever do have those two children,

611
00:31:49,135 --> 00:31:50,900
I would never do this to them.

612
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,250
I would accept them for who they are,

613
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:55,642
Including who they date, no matter what,

614
00:31:55,677 --> 00:31:58,000
And i'd make sure
they damn well knew it.

615
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,100
Hello?

616
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,100
Really?

617
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,000
Okay.

618
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,665
Ooh.

619
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,865
I'm so sorry.

620
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,900
I know this is not
what you signed up for.

621
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,200
It's okay.

622
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,865
It doesn't hurt nearly as bad

623
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,400
As waking up that morning
in santorini and...

624
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,800
Finding you'd jumped on a boat.

625
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,565
Yeah, well, um,

626
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,600
That night wasn't exactly
what i signed up for either.

627
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,800
The whole thing caught
me a bit by surprise.

628
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,700
No, i, um, i get it, which
is why i was surprised

629
00:32:52,735 --> 00:32:54,500
When your grandmother
called me last week.

630
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,900
Wait. Last week?

631
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,900
I wasn't even ing to
cotillion last week.

632
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,100
Yeah, but cece said she
thought you'd change your mind.

633
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,400
What are you doing
here? Shouldn't you be...

634
00:33:14,435 --> 00:33:16,265
Anywhere but here, yes. Huh.

635
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,000
So please listen to
me and don't interrupt,

636
00:33:19,035 --> 00:33:21,700
Because what i have
to say is hard for me.

637
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,765
Okay.

638
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,465
When i was your age,

639
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,200
I would have been lucky
to find a guy like you,

640
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,600
And i kind of did, but
when it came down to it,

641
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,167
I thought my mother knew who i was

642
00:33:33,202 --> 00:33:34,700
Much better than i knew myself.

643
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,100
I'm not sure exactly
who my daughter was,

644
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
But i know who she's
become since she met you.

645
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,200
She returns home every
night at a reasonable hour.

646
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:48,300
She doesn't drink. She doesn't do drugs.

647
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,800
I don't know if you're
responsible for that,

648
00:33:50,835 --> 00:33:52,800
But i don't think it's a coincidence.

649
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,500
You belong with my daughter,

650
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,400
And i think everyone should know that.

651
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,000
Will you come with me?

652
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,100
Yes, mrs. Van der
woodsen. I would love to.

653
00:34:04,135 --> 00:34:06,800
Good. And it's lily.

654
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,765
Have you seen nate?

655
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,200
Nate was asked to leave, but here i am.

656
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
I know that look.

657
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
That's your look when
your plan falls into place.

658
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,900
You're enjoying this.

659
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,800
You knew carter was going to my house.

660
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,000
You tipped off gossip girl.

661
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,900
You ruined my cotillion on purpose.

662
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,450
You did all this for your own enjoyment

663
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:49,900
And didn't care what it would do to me,

664
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,800
Which is exactly why you
and i could never work.

665
00:34:52,835 --> 00:34:55,200
Wait. Slow down there,
waldorf. You make me sick.

666
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,900
This thing between
us- It's over for good.

667
00:34:59,935 --> 00:35:01,300
Look, blair, wait.
I didn't mean to-

668
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:02,200
Don't talk to me.

669
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,100
Blair!

670
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,900
That was quite a mess you made,

671
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,300
But i was able to clean it up.

672
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,900
The chairs agreed to reissue
your presentation statement

673
00:35:24,935 --> 00:35:26,600
In the committee's winter newsletter.

674
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,900
I stood up for you.

675
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,500
What are you talking about?
With dan-I defended you.

676
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,100
Mm, we'll talk about that later.

677
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,200
No, we don't need to
talk at all, grana. A.

678
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,300
I just want to know one thing.

679
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,900
Are you even ill?

680
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,500
No. (Chuckles)

681
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,565
But i could be.

682
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,500
All those cigarettes and cocktails.

683
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,600
Why did you do this?

684
00:35:54,635 --> 00:35:56,400
Oh, serena.

685
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,200
There is so much you don't understand.

686
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,000
A woman has to earn the
right to create her own rules.

687
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,700
Things aren't the way they were
when you were young, grandma.

688
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,100
You may be right about that.

689
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,300
Hey. Have you seen blair waldorf?

690
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,700
Up there.

691
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,100
It was so hot how you
punched carter out.

692
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
I'd never seen you do
anything like that before.

693
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,300
Spotted- Chuck
bass losing something

694
00:37:18,335 --> 00:37:20,600
No one knew he
had to begin with-

695
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,500
His heart.

696
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,100
Mom, i'm sorry.

697
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,700
I thought i could make it in time.

698
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,400
Yeah, i know.

699
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,200
I accept your apology,

700
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,800
But it doesn't really make it okay.

701
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,800
Sweetie.

702
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,300
Honey, as you get older,

703
00:38:01,335 --> 00:38:03,165
Every choice that you make

704
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,000
Defines who you're gonna turn into,

705
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,000
So rather than apologizi to me,

706
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,265
You need to look at yourself

707
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,500
And ask if you like the
person you're becoming.

708
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,100
We're not supposed to talk, remember?

709
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:34,765
Oh, i had
to. I-

710
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,700
Your mother came to see me,
and she mentioned something

711
00:38:37,735 --> 00:38:40,400
About why you left me
all those years ago.

712
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:41,700
Oh.

713
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,200
Yes, well, she made me an
offer i couldn't refuse,

714
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,500
And i wasn't strong enough then.

715
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,400
Why didn't you tell me?

716
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,600
Oh, come on. You never
would have understood.

717
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:54,565
But if i had known

718
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,500
You hadn't actually
left me for-For him,

719
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,467
I- I... i mean, maybe-
Listen, don't. Don't.

720
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:03,400
Don't say it. (Chuckles)
don't even think it.

721
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,300
I can't help myself.

722
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,400
I never should have let you...

723
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,300
Let me go.

724
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,800
It's often said that
no matter the truth,

725
00:39:45,835 --> 00:39:48,165
People see what they want to see.

726
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,765
Some people might take
a step back and find out

727
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,800
They were looking at the
same big picture all along.

728
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,665
Some people might see

729
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,100
That their lies have
almost caught up to them.

730
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:13,100
* i said it's too late to apologize *

731
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,600
* it's too late *

732
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,800
* yeah, yeah, yeah *

733
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,600
* i'd take another chance, take a fall *

734
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:32,600
* take a shot for you *

735
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,900
* mm, i need you like
a heart needs a beat *

736
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,500
* but it's nothing new *

737
00:40:40,535 --> 00:40:42,065
* yeah, yeah *

738
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,165
* i loved you with a fire red *

739
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,200
* now it's turning
blue and you say sorry *

740
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,900
* like the angel heaven
let me think was you *

741
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,500
Some people may see
what was there all along.

742
00:40:58,535 --> 00:41:02,165
* it's too late to apologize *

743
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,550
And then there are
those other people-

744
00:41:04,585 --> 00:41:06,865
The ones who run as far as they can

745
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,000
So they don't have
to look at themselves.

746
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,300
Where to, mr. Bass?

747
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,200
The airport.

748
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,765
And as for me?

749
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,700
I can see clearly now.

750
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,000
X.O.X.O., gossip girl.

751
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,100
