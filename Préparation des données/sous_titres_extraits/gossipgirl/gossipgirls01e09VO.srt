00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,701
Gossip girl here--

2
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:05,822
Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.

3
00:00:05,822 --> 00:00:07,496
How's your mom doing with the divorce and everything?

4
00:00:07,496 --> 00:00:10,666
So my dad left her for another man. she lost 15 pounds,

5
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:11,889
Got an eye lift. it's been good for her.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,095
My mom kind of left us a couple months ago.

7
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:17,057
My dad and my sister don't really see that.

8
00:00:17,057 --> 00:00:19,322
I don't know what's happened with my wife or my marriage,

9
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:22,632
And you showing up here randomly doesn't make figuring that out any easier

10
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:24,519
Am I the only one who thinks this is extremely weird?

11
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,271
Forget about it. if dad can let it go, so can you.

12
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:28,087
I can't believe you didn't tell me your mom came home.

13
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:29,408
Your wife despises me.

14
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:30,628
I wouldn't say that. well, she did.

15
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:33,585
You should deal with your father. he needs you. I don't.

16
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:36,284
We broke up, okay? he was gonna get back together with me,

17
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,929
But only so my mom would help his dad.

18
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:39,778
I need your support here, son, and your trust.

19
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:40,863
Well, you better hope for your sake

20
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:41,841
They don't call your son to the stand.

21
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:46,201
Do you like me?  define "like."

22
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:52,766
And who am i?

23
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:55,138
That's a secret I'll never tell.

24
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:55,984
You know you love me.

25
00:00:56,978 --> 00:00:59,867
X.o.x.o., gossip girl.

26
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,790
As per gossip girl's thanksgiving tradition,

27
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,320
I'm trading my laptop for stove top,

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,290
And for the next 16 hours,

29
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,320
The only thing I'm dishing is seconds.

30
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,290
When the cat's away, the mice will play.

31
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,290
Have fun, little rodents.

32
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,090
I mean, who gets wasted on thanksgiving?

33
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,090
The holidays are lonely for people.

34
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,660
I wanted to keep 'em company. whoo!

35
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,760
Your mom is freaking out, so my mom is freaking out.

36
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,960
What, which means you freak out?

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,120
Blair, just cut the cord. go nuts. come on.

38
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,890
Let's do shots. come on! I told lily that you were buying a pie.

39
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,960
Oh, pie.

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,260
Where is your purse? uh, my purse...

41
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,890
Oh, great. all right. you stay here, okay?

42
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,360
I'm gonna go look.

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,060
Don't drink or hit on anything.

44
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,560
Pie's been secured.

45
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,390
Thanksgiving no longer needs to be canceled, all right?

46
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,420
Hey, mom, you know, I need to go. I'm sorry. bye.

47
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,760
Oh, man.

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,460
Hey! what are you doing?

49
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,520
Hey, right of way, pal.

50
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,020
Screw you, buddy! hey, uh, excu--excuse me.

51
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,290
D-do you need, like, a crossing guard or a cab maybe?

52
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,790
Oh, pie.

53
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,320
It's more like roadkill now,

54
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,220
But, uh, better it than you, right?

55
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,020
Um...

56
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,320
I'm--i'm dan... humphrey. hi.

57
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,120
Hi. uh, I don't know. we met last year.

58
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,920
Uh. you m-- you might not remember.

59
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,460
Yeah, i--you probably don't, but look,

60
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,420
You should be more careful. you need to keep your hands off of her.

61
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,460
Blair! trying to take advantage of her on the holidays.

62
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,820
Come on. let's go, serena.

63
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,620
Bye, dave.

64
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,160
Bye.

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,060
Bye.

66
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,720
Bye, serena.

67
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,960
Hey.

68
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,460
And hello to you.

69
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,860
Big national holiday. you excited? kind of am.

70
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,460
Might be the first thanksgiving in a while

71
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,660
That I actually remember. yeah, I bet.

72
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,820
Huh?

73
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,490
Nothing. uh, you-- uh, you at blair's?

74
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,490
Almost. her dad's gonna be home for the first time

75
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,010
Since he left, so she's really excited.

76
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,920
Oh, well, family reunions are all around then.

77
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,390
Uh, we, too, have a full humphrey household.

78
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,590
Hopefully, it'll stick. well, it seems like your mom is really trying.

79
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,220
Better thanksgiving than never.

80
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,420
Call me between every course?

81
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,460
Okay.

82
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,090
Mwah. bye.

83
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,090
Mom, is it really okay to cook with this much heavy cream?

84
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,698
Our arteries give us a free pass on turkey day.

85
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:40,990
It's a shame our family doesn't have a few hundred more members.

86
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,690
Do you think I bought too much? only by several tons.

87
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,720
But it's our first holiday back.

88
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,986
I wanted to make sure it was special.  mm.

89
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:51,287
I think they call that guilt. yeah, I guess they do.

90
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:54,757
But if it means more midnight turkey sandwiches for all of us,

91
00:03:54,757 --> 00:03:57,757
Then so be it. yeah, see, dan? uh, we on this side of the kitchen

92
00:03:57,757 --> 00:04:00,757
Choose to be positive. yeah, dan. what's it gonna be?

93
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:02,757
You with us or against us?

94
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:05,257
Uh....  fine. fine. but only if I can

95
00:04:05,257 --> 00:04:07,387
Take the cranberry sauce out of the can.

96
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:08,887
That is my specialty.

97
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:10,887
I have to find this recipe before my dad gets here.

98
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,887
Harold waldorf's famous pumpkin pie.

99
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:14,917
Well, it may have been bobby flay's,

100
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:17,887
But it didn't stop my dad from taking credit for it.

101
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:21,457
It's gonna be perfect! look at you. quite the chipper sous-chef.

102
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:23,417
Well, I'm in a good mood.

103
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:25,787
It happens. sometimes 'cause I increase my lexapro,

104
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:28,357
Sometimes because my dad's in town.

105
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:31,387
And sometimes, mostly because things are good with a boy.

106
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:33,917
You and nate get back together?

107
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:35,917
You mean since gossip girl

108
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:37,917
Published pictures of him and some skank?

109
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:40,587
So that's a no. what's chuck doing today?

110
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:43,257
Why are you asking me?

111
00:04:43,257 --> 00:04:45,187
Well, you guys are friends.

112
00:04:45,187 --> 00:04:48,587
And, blair, look, you know you can tell me anything.

113
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:51,357
I'd be the last person to judge anyone.

114
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,317
With good reason.

115
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:55,357
Blair, I saw you with chuck.

116
00:04:57,417 --> 00:05:00,017
I don't know what I was thinking.

117
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:03,017
I mean, sleeping with him once,  maybe you could understand,

118
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:05,257
But twice? wait. you slept with him?

119
00:05:05,257 --> 00:05:06,957
Shh! ugh. blair!

120
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:08,261
What happened to no judging?

121
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:10,357
I'm not, but I thought you wanted to wait.

122
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:11,778
I thought you wanted to make things special.

123
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,457
Oh, so nate gets the free pass, and I'm the slut?

124
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:15,917
Tell me you didn't sleep with chuck for revenge.

125
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:19,057
Well, it wasn't because I like his natural musk,

126
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:21,057
And besides, nothing hurts more

127
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:23,787
Than sleeping with the best friend, right, s.?

128
00:05:23,787 --> 00:05:25,787
Way to prove a point.

129
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:28,817
Well, I learned from the master. if you're sleeping with chuck,

130
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:31,117
I'd say the student's become the master.

131
00:05:31,117 --> 00:05:34,157
Are you jealous you didn't get to sleep with him first?

132
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:37,117
There had to be somebody left on the upper east side.

133
00:05:37,117 --> 00:05:40,317
Blair, darling, are you going to help me at all?

134
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:43,557
Serena, do you know when your mother's arriving?

135
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:47,117
She's not. we're not doing thanksgiving here anymore.

136
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:49,157
Oh. why?

137
00:05:49,157 --> 00:05:51,717
Because I uninvited them.

138
00:05:57,117 --> 00:06:00,087
Happy holidays, eleanor.

139
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:08,317
Mom, I know it'sy fault that we're here,

140
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:09,106
But let's not get crazy.

141
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:10,817
Well, I don't know what you're complaining about.

142
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:13,763
I'm just trying to provide my family  with a home-cooked meal.

143
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:16,318
You don't know how to cook.

144
00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:18,318
Well, don't blame me. talk to your sister.

145
00:06:18,318 --> 00:06:21,318
She's the one that got us exiled from the waldorfs. oh, I'm sorry.

146
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:23,375
And even if you did cook, we don't have an oven.

147
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:24,918
Preaching to the converted, eric.

148
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,918
Look, we'll just pick up a few things and try to make do.

149
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,988
Like peking duck on thanksgiving. hmm. not a bad idea.

150
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:34,358
No, mom. all the other shops are closed. there's nothing wrong

151
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:36,758
With having chinese food on thanksgiving.

152
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:39,888
What? jews having been doing it on christmas since forever.

153
00:06:39,888 --> 00:06:42,588
Look, a pumpkin. isn't this...

154
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:44,458
This is festive, yes?

155
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,788
We're gonna eat a pumpkin?

156
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:48,918
Mom.

157
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:51,958
Oh.

158
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,488
So you couldn't make it past the salad, huh?

159
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:57,088
I opened the cranberries. my work is done.

160
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:58,258
How's blair's?

161
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:01,258
Uh, I wouldn't know. she gave me the boot.

162
00:07:01,258 --> 00:07:04,918
Wh--she kicked you out of her house? what happened now?

163
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:06,988
Uh, don't ask, but the good news is,

164
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:09,388
My mom is gonna slice us up a pumpkin.

165
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:10,888
Oh, and there's duck.

166
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:15,558
No, no, no. you can't eat duck and raw pumpkin on thanksgiving.

167
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:17,118
Uh, you know what?

168
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:20,018
I'm the guardian of vanessa's sister's van for the weekend,

169
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:22,058
And we here at the humphrey manor

170
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:25,488
Have an oddly large kitchen table. what are you suggesting?

171
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:28,858
These smell great. yes, so we can starve in a fragrant hotel room.

172
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:31,888
We're not starving. look, I got us into this mess,

173
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:34,488
So I'm gonna get us out of it. elaborate, serena.

174
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,718
Thanksgiving at the humphreys.

175
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:39,658
Dan invited me, and eric's friends with his sister,

176
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:42,718
And his dad's really cool.  awesome. I'm leaving the pumpkin.

177
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:44,658
What do you say, mom?

178
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:59,625
Found it. sous-chef, you're needed.

179
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,155
Ready and awaiting orders. I see we have extra help.

180
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:05,395
Yes, well, serena's spending thanksgiving with us this year.

181
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:08,295
Ah, the more the merrier. happy to have you, my dear.

182
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:09,955
Whoo! yes!

183
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:12,125
The canapéS were a huge success.

184
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,155
I saved one for you, blair.

185
00:08:14,155 --> 00:08:16,195
I'm not really hungry.

186
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,195
Well, what does that mean, you're not really hungry? well, I had, like,

187
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:22,725
15 of them this morning when daddy first made them. 15?

188
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:25,195
Serena. serena!

189
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:27,155
Do you think that's wise?

190
00:08:27,155 --> 00:08:30,195
Darling, she's fine. she has been for two months.

191
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:33,655
What did the doctor say? don't drive us crazy, okay?

192
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:34,895
So, please.

193
00:08:34,895 --> 00:08:36,395
Ah, fine.

194
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:39,525
We are going to need to set another place at the table.

195
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:42,025
Laurel brought one of the models I'm working with.

196
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,225
Do I know her? what's her name?

197
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:46,325
His name is roman.

198
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,555
Ah. roman.

199
00:08:48,555 --> 00:08:51,255
Not this one, harold.

200
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,225
We have to work together.

201
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:54,695
Hey, you!

202
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:57,595
Happy thanksgiving. you, too. good to see you.

203
00:08:57,595 --> 00:08:58,543
Mwah. want one? ah, sure.

204
00:08:58,543 --> 00:08:59,620
Good boy.

205
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,010
Nate the great.

206
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,210
Mmm. so what'd I miss? mm, nothing.

207
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,089
You're about to witness the return of sober serena.

208
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:06,062
Oh, nate!

209
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:09,092
Oh, no. oh, no. or maybe not. sweetie, would you take her upstairs?

210
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:11,500
Put her in the bath before your mother gets wind of this whole situation?

211
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,500
What, and leave you all alone? thanksgiving is our thing.

212
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:18,217
Nate, will you please take care of her? please?

213
00:09:18,217 --> 00:09:19,987
Oh, I will. come on.

214
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:24,717
Here. daddy, can I help with the pumpkin pie?

215
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:26,287
Of course.

216
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:27,817
Thank you. crush them.

217
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,787
Thank you very much. crush them.

218
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:36,191
Caterers?

219
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:38,191
What's going on here?

220
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,691
Everyone is getting ready for our lovely dinner,

221
00:09:40,691 --> 00:09:42,261
And you should be, too.

222
00:09:42,261 --> 00:09:45,521
Everyone except daddy. where is he?

223
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:47,061
I thought you knew.

224
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:48,361
Knew what?

225
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:51,161
Your father isn't coming.

226
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,891
He didn't tell you?

227
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:56,861
He decided to stay in paris.

228
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:58,300
He's got either too much work,

229
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:00,388
Or roman is too much work. who knows?

230
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:03,237
I-i don't understand. if he wasn't coming,

231
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:04,298
Why wouldn't he just call me and tell me himself?

232
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:05,608
Darling, you should know by now

233
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:08,378
That your father is not a fan of the difficult conversation.

234
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:10,808
Now why don't you run along and change into something

235
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:12,108
A little more...

236
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:14,638
Enchanting?

237
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:17,608
That's good.

238
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,478
Are you sure you don't want us to stay with you?

239
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:26,478
Yeah, we don't want to leave you, mom,

240
00:10:26,478 --> 00:10:29,508
If you don't feel well. oh, no. you kids have fun.

241
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:32,508
I don't have an appetite anyway.

242
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:35,708
Oh, hold on a second. that must be dan.

243
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,338
Hey!

244
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:40,378
Room service. oh. oh, no, no, no, no, sir. you have the wrong room.

245
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:42,878
Oh, no, you're early. I lied.

246
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:43,938
Mom.

247
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:48,938
All I care about is that you two are together.

248
00:10:48,938 --> 00:10:51,378
I don't want to be an imposition. no.

249
00:10:51,378 --> 00:10:53,978
Man with van, at your service.

250
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:56,908
Hey. hey.

251
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:59,578
Uh, bold choice of attire, mrs. van der woodsen,

252
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:02,138
Unless it's what they're wearing on the runway these days.

253
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:05,138
No, my mom sicked out because she didn't want to be imposing.

254
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:05,995
You know what?

255
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:07,708
I am fine just curling up and reading a good book.

256
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,498
But you're supposed to be with your family on thanksgiving.

257
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:12,828
Yeah, and nicholas sparks is hardly family.

258
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:17,841
I'm not taking no for an answer. in fact, I'm not even asking.

259
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:20,743
You are coming with us. I'm adult-napping you.

260
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:25,375
Fine, just stop talking, and I'll get ready.

261
00:11:26,492 --> 00:11:29,132
Make it snappy. I'm double-parked. thanks.

262
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:30,762
Hey, rufus humphrey.

263
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:32,123
Leave a message, and I'll get back to you.

264
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,380
Rufus, it's lily. um, your very persistent son

265
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,483
Insisted that I join you for dinner.

266
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:43,197
I want to remind you that my kids do not know that we are friendly,

267
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:44,910
And I would like to keep it that way.

268
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,080
That said...

269
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,110
I look forward to seeing you.

270
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,480
Ugh! how could he just blow me off?

271
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,010
At the last minute.

272
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:40,208
Just like I was asked to step down

273
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,262
From the committee for the snowflake ball,

274
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,032
And how I wasn't asked back to the lincoln center foundation.

275
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:47,372
I thought at least, your father's lawyer might join us for dessert.

276
00:12:47,372 --> 00:12:49,422
Mom, stop. you were all for acting like nothing was wrong

277
00:12:49,422 --> 00:12:51,603
Until it landed on you. nate.

278
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:52,787
I forgot to call the bail bondsman.

279
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:55,297
Maybe he has nowhere to go. mom, no one is more mad than I am,

280
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:57,160
But this is not the right way.

281
00:12:57,161 --> 00:13:00,763
Nathaniel, I don't need you to fight this fight for me.

282
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:11,433
Where do you think you're going? anywhere but here.

283
00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:22,933
Thank you. what's taking dan and serena so long?

284
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:25,233
Hey, we're here. there you are.

285
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:28,233
You're lucky you made it while the turkey's still hot.

286
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:31,303
Mom, this is serena, and this is her brother eric.

287
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:31,303
It is so nice to meet you both.

288
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:34,403
It's nice to meet you, too.  nice to meet you. hi.

289
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:36,333
And this is their mother, lily.

290
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:41,303
Happy thanksgiving.

291
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,940
Just in time, but I thought you were gonna bring pie.

292
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,480
I did, but it kinda got run over by a taxi,

293
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,880
Uh, as I was trying to help this girl stay out of traffic. ah, well,

294
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,880
Who needs dessert

295
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,840
When we have a real-life hero in our midst?

296
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,880
Your brother just saved a girl.

297
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,880
I thought you needed to be near a girl for that to happen.

298
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,140
Not just any girl. the girl.

299
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,180
Oh, the blonde you stalk at school? just the one.

300
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,480
A thing for blondes. you are your father's son. not just any blonde.

301
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,180
Apparently, I like the ones who get drunk on thanksgiving

302
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,640
And almost die. well, your dad liked 'em

303
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,010
Dangerous and troubled, too, so... you were dangerous?

304
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,080
Who said I was talking about me? well,

305
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,080
I didn't realize there was anyone else.

306
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,140
Well, it is so nice to meet you.

307
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,180
Alison. right, it's nice to meet you, too.

308
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,140
Lily, was it?

309
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,640
Yes.

310
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,380
Well, I'm just gonna take these coats and put them in, um,

311
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,210
Dan's room. uh, you know what? it's okay. I've got them.

312
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,640
Oh.

313
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,680
Oh, thank you. mm.

314
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,540
Okay, eric and jenny, napkin duty.

315
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,240
Serena and dan, I want every water glass filled,

316
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,940
And every candle you can find lit. I am sorry.

317
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,940
I did not know that you were--

318
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,910
Back? well, I am.

319
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,580
And why would you know?

320
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,980
Well, dan never mentioned it when he invited me.

321
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,180
I called. I didn't hear the phone.

322
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,340
You know what? it's fine. it's fine.

323
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,980
Let's just have a great time. this holiday's about sharing.

324
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,310
Right. and if you don't mind, um, could we not share too much?

325
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,780
I haven't exactly told my kids about my past.

326
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,810
Well... our past.

327
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,940
Hey, turkey's almost room temp, guys. come on down.

328
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,010
You grab the mashed.

329
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,040
I got that.

330
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,140
Happy thanksgiving.

331
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,240
If it's on the web site,

332
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,280
Then I'll go look at it. otherwise, I'm not gonna.

333
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,380
Well, that goes without speaking. we know that.

334
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,580
And who's designing the page? well, I wanted to talk to you.

335
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,480
The guy with no hair? mm-hmm. yeah.

336
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,110
Blair...

337
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,340
You haven't touched your food.

338
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,340
Come on, darling. what has gotten into you?

339
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,080
Well, I was going to wait till after dinner,

340
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,780
But I guess now is as good a time as any.

341
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,840
Did you call daddy and say that I didn't want to see him

342
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,310
This thanksgiving?

343
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,580
Of course not. what a ridiculous accusation.

344
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,580
So you didn't tell him that I was so angry at him for leaving,

345
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,640
That I didn't even want to talk to him today?

346
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,510
You had no right to uninvite him.

347
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,310
When are you gonna get it through your head?

348
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,810
He left us.

349
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,840
He didn't leave us. he left you.

350
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,310
That's enough.

351
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,940
That's enough.

352
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,440
If you want to take this up with me,

353
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,840
We can discuss it later, after our guests have left.

354
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,510
Right now you either eat or you leave the table.

355
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,510
I told you, I'm not hungry.

356
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,640
Or maybe dessert will change your mind.

357
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,310
Where is daddy's pie? hmm?

358
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,880
Care for dessert, sir? I don't see his pumpkin pie.

359
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,272
Well, there were so many delicious choices coming from the caterer,

360
00:16:55,272 --> 00:16:57,772
We just sent that one down to the doorman.

361
00:16:57,772 --> 00:16:59,772
What is thanksgiving after all, hmm?

362
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:05,342
Now choose one of those amazing desserts.

363
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,412
Mm-hmm.

364
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:18,642
So, uh, mrs. van der woodsen,

365
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:21,642
Um, what were thanksgivings like when you were growing up?

366
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,172
Serena said you were raised in california? oh,

367
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,172
I grew up on a little ranch in montecito.

368
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:28,342
I didn't know there were little ranches. there aren't.

369
00:18:33,672 --> 00:18:37,212
I don't want to be rude, but I should take this. yeah, sure.

370
00:18:37,212 --> 00:18:40,472
Hey, we're right in the middle of di--

371
00:18:40,472 --> 00:18:43,112
Yeah. o-of course. I'm on my way.

372
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:44,442
What's up?

373
00:18:44,442 --> 00:18:47,912
I'm sorry, but I have to go. is everything all right?

374
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:50,212
No, but, um, it will be, I hope.

375
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,212
I'm sorry. I can't really say more, but it's nothing about us. okay.

376
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:57,212
I was having a lot of fun, though. bye. all right.

377
00:18:57,212 --> 00:19:00,712
I'm sorry, mom. I have to go. oh, of course. you're such a good friend.

378
00:19:00,712 --> 00:19:03,542
Look, um, I hope you don't mind, but my daughter has to go.

379
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,042
Do you need to go with her? no, no, no, mom. stay. have fun, please.

380
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:10,272
Thanks, guys.  it was nice to meet you.

381
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:11,811
Is she gonna be okay?

382
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:14,472
Yeah, uh, yeah. I don't think it has anything to do with her,

383
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:17,412
But, um, you were talking about your ranch.

384
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:19,612
Did you have any horses?

385
00:19:19,612 --> 00:19:22,212
Yes, I had a few. um, I had my own, rosewood.

386
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:25,212
My dad has a song called "rosewood." oh, but no, not that rosewood.

387
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:28,272
I completely forgot about that song. yeah, it's about my mom.

388
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:31,942
You know, 'cause she had this perfume that she always wore.

389
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:34,672
And it was rose and...  sandalwood.

390
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:37,142
Sandalwood. it was like her own personal scent.

391
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,130
I'm a fool.  you're not a fool.

392
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,859
Um, raise your hand if you're over 30

393
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:53,089
And acting really weird right now.

394
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:55,019
I'm sorry, alison.

395
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:57,689
I never told rufus about that horse.

396
00:19:57,689 --> 00:20:01,359
So I'm sure it's just a coincidence. wait a minute here.

397
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,689
Why are you talking like you know each other?

398
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:06,789
Do you two know each other?

399
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:13,519
Uh, we kinda did know each other,

400
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,559
A long, long time ago. what?

401
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,089
Know each other how?

402
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:28,089
Oh, my god.

403
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:30,589
This is unbelievable. you know what? I need some air.

404
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:32,689
Don't follow me.

405
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:40,389
You have a lot of explaining to do.

406
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:42,419
Mom, wait.

407
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,159
May we please be excused? yeah, sure.

408
00:21:02,972 --> 00:21:04,972
Watch it. come on. come on. come on.

409
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,872
I don't want a bath.

410
00:21:06,872 --> 00:21:09,912
Oh, too bad. blair's direct orders. blair's not the boss of me.

411
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:11,912
Sit. oh, are you new here?

412
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:13,912
Cause blair's the boss of all of us.

413
00:21:13,912 --> 00:21:16,872
Oh, seriously, serena, you smell like the floor of a brewery.

414
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:19,242
I do not. yes, you do.

415
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:21,542
Oh, my god. yes, I do.

416
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:22,842
Yeah.

417
00:21:22,842 --> 00:21:26,712
Brewery floor with a hint of secondhand smoke?

418
00:21:26,712 --> 00:21:29,042
And a pint of old spice.

419
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:30,472
Whoa. whoa.

420
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:33,472
I totally need a bath. yeah, deal with it. please.

421
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:37,072
Blair's a bossy genius. oh, yes, she is. mm.

422
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:39,672
So what about you?

423
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:42,612
What about me? I don't smell like an ashtray.

424
00:21:42,612 --> 00:21:44,842
But you look like an ass tray. aah!

425
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:46,842
Aah! hey, serena. stop, stop, stop.

426
00:21:46,842 --> 00:21:48,772
Stop, serena. serena, stop.

427
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:50,772
What's wrong with you? god. oh.

428
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:53,742
Ow. god.

429
00:21:53,742 --> 00:21:55,372
Aah! aah! go away!

430
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:57,412
Oh, what, what, what, what, what? you started it, dude.

431
00:21:57,412 --> 00:22:01,042
You started it. you started it. oh! what? stop it!

432
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,512
What are you guys doing?

433
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:13,672
My hair! my--aah! aah!

434
00:22:15,512 --> 00:22:17,012
I got you both!

435
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:19,372
I'm king of the world.

436
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:21,212
I'm king of the world!

437
00:22:49,642 --> 00:22:51,772
Hey, it's me.

438
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,112
I didn't mean for it to happen.

439
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:16,642
I didn't see your dad downstairs.

440
00:23:20,242 --> 00:23:24,042
My mother just decides everything, you know?

441
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:27,172
Everything in the world is just totally up to her.

442
00:23:28,712 --> 00:23:30,372
I know.

443
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:39,242
Hey, why don't we get out of here?

444
00:23:39,242 --> 00:23:41,442
I'm not going back to that party.

445
00:23:41,442 --> 00:23:43,542
No, I mean, outta here, outta here.

446
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:47,242
Out of this apartment, to a place a little more sane.

447
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:52,342
Any place would qualify.

448
00:23:58,042 --> 00:24:00,742
So you actually threatened lily van der woodsen

449
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,242
With physical violence?

450
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:04,272
Mom, you are a badass.

451
00:24:04,272 --> 00:24:06,272
Yeah, well, what can I say?

452
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:09,312
I was younger then and wearing steel-toed boots.

453
00:24:09,312 --> 00:24:12,112
No, no. no, we never actually came to blows.

454
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:16,912
I focused on transforming my anger into art.

455
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:18,442
I made some collages.

456
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:21,372
I wrote a trilogy of 1-act plays about her,

457
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:24,372
Named the character milly, to try to be, you know, subtle.

458
00:24:24,372 --> 00:24:25,672
It's clever.

459
00:24:27,912 --> 00:24:30,812
So what was so bad about her?

460
00:24:30,812 --> 00:24:33,512
And I mean aside from the superior fluttering eyelids

461
00:24:33,512 --> 00:24:35,672
And punishing sarcasm.

462
00:24:35,672 --> 00:24:39,772
Well, uh, she was your dad's first great love,

463
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:43,272
As she liked to remind me every chance she got.

464
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:46,212
It's kind of hard to compete with that.

465
00:24:54,142 --> 00:24:56,472
You've uh, been in here for a half-hour.

466
00:24:56,472 --> 00:24:58,512
Yeah, well,

467
00:24:58,512 --> 00:24:59,646
Not nearly enough timeto fathom

468
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:01,512
How you allowed me to walk into this situation.

469
00:25:01,512 --> 00:25:02,672
Allowed you? th--

470
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:05,249
You were the last person

471
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:06,127
I expected to come through my front door today.

472
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:08,127
Yeah, well, at the very least,

473
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:11,327
You knew that serena would come home and tell me all about

474
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:13,627
The wonderful thanksgiving she had with dan, his father,

475
00:25:13,627 --> 00:25:15,127
Oh, and his mother.

476
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:18,338
Is this really how you think I deserve to find out?

477
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:22,867
I don't know what I do or do not owe you.

478
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:25,627
I mean, we haven't actually defined

479
00:25:25,627 --> 00:25:27,597
What we are to each other.

480
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:33,267
Well, maybe this is the perfect opportunity to do it.

481
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:35,497
But, lily...

482
00:25:35,497 --> 00:25:38,497
These past few weeks have...

483
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:41,227
Have been what?

484
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:47,397
You can't even say it, can you?

485
00:25:47,397 --> 00:25:50,527
I can, but I shouldn't.

486
00:25:54,827 --> 00:25:58,327
Look, for better, for worse, you're one of my oldest friends.

487
00:25:58,327 --> 00:26:00,567
Mm. oldest friends?

488
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:02,567
That's certainly not how it felt

489
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:04,527
When you kissed me at eleanor's party.

490
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:06,927
What?

491
00:26:10,997 --> 00:26:12,597
Alison, honey...

492
00:26:12,597 --> 00:26:14,627
Dan, will you go and...

493
00:26:14,627 --> 00:26:18,001
Uh, check on jenny and eric. yeah.

494
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:26,070
Mom, where's dad?

495
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,110
How dare you do that.

496
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,582
Leave in the middle of thanksgiving dinner?

497
00:26:29,582 --> 00:26:31,812
I need to talk to dad. dad?

498
00:26:31,812 --> 00:26:34,682
Dad? oh, my god. dad. dad.

499
00:26:34,682 --> 00:26:36,682
Mom, call 9-1-1. hurry!

500
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:40,763
Dad, please, wake up. dad!

501
00:26:40,763 --> 00:26:42,263
Dorita.

502
00:26:42,263 --> 00:26:45,663
Easy. take a seat, honey.

503
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:47,703
Oh, goodness. oh, how do I smell now?

504
00:26:47,703 --> 00:26:49,203
Uh, you smell fantastic,

505
00:26:49,203 --> 00:26:51,703
But you might not wanna keep asking people that.

506
00:26:51,703 --> 00:26:54,803
Serena, you look wonderful. that shirt was made for you. actually,

507
00:26:51,703 --> 00:26:54,803
It was made for you.

508
00:26:54,803 --> 00:26:56,833
Well, I knew there was a reason I liked it. hmm?

509
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:58,503
Yours, too, I see. and mine.

510
00:26:58,503 --> 00:27:00,633
No, no, no, no. oh, no, no, no.

511
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:02,763
Would you help me with the potatoes? yes.

512
00:27:02,763 --> 00:27:05,303
Ah!

513
00:27:05,303 --> 00:27:09,563
Don't tell me it's a big deal. I'm well aware of the stakes. hey.

514
00:27:05,303 --> 00:27:09,563
Who's dad talking to?

515
00:27:09,563 --> 00:27:12,203
What now? the office. something about that deal with the dutch company.

516
00:27:12,203 --> 00:27:14,863
So it looks like I'll have to slip out for a few minutes.

517
00:27:14,863 --> 00:27:17,033
Dad, it's a holiday. not in amsterdam.

518
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:20,133
Well, we are in america. tell them it will wait till tomorrow.

519
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:23,733
Sweetheart, I don't want to go. I have to.

520
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:25,763
I brought this deal in,

521
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:27,763
But if meltzer closes it without me,

522
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:30,763
I don't get the commission. forget the commission.

523
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:30,763
I'll write you a check myself.

524
00:27:30,763 --> 00:27:33,003
Sit. we're just about to eat.

525
00:27:33,003 --> 00:27:35,533
I think I just lost my appetite.

526
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:52,563
Your father and his headaches.

527
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:55,303
Probably took the vicodin and forgot.

528
00:27:55,303 --> 00:27:57,463
Had some whiskey, and the next thing you know--

529
00:27:57,463 --> 00:28:00,433
Mom, seriously, did you hear anything the doctor said?

530
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:03,763
With what he took, he could have cured 30 headaches.

531
00:28:03,763 --> 00:28:05,503
Mom, he's got a problem,

532
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:07,503
And ignoring it almost killed him.

533
00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:09,563
Oh, no. this is not my fault.

534
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,603
I'm not blaming anybody.

535
00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:13,470
You can blame whoever you want, just not me.

536
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,370
All I'm guilty of is trying to make his life easier. easier?

537
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,370
You've made his life impossible.

538
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,870
What do you mean?

539
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,870
He's had everything he ever wanted just handed to him.

540
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,370
My father set him up with his own firm.

541
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,170
He gave us the house that we live in, the hamptons, the boat.

542
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:30,230
He's never had to earn a dime,

543
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:30,230
And how do you think that's working out for him,

544
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,570
Mom, huh? wake up!

545
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,530
All he had to do was sit behind a desk, put on a suit

546
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,500
And not get arrested, and he couldn't manage to do that.

547
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,500
You want me to give him more responsibility in the family?

548
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,170
Look, I don't know what the answer is,

549
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:51,370
But we can't keep going on like this, or else we'll lose him.

550
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,400
Excuse me.

551
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,030
Sorry to interrupt, but mr. archibald is awake.

552
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,930
He was asking for you. thank you.

553
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,470
You're welcome.

554
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,370
I'll go see how he's doing.

555
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:08,030
No. I will.

556
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,770
I'm not saying you're overreacting per se,

557
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,770
Just having a reaction that is above and beyond

558
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:22,600
What is appropriate. I have been killing myself trying to make up

559
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,600
For what happened in hudson. which is not an overreaction, I might add.

560
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,600
And then I find out that the two of you

561
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Are making out at theme parties? oh, it was hardly making out,

562
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,600
And there is an explanation.

563
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,900
Hey, guys. I'm back, and i... brought... blair.  hey.

564
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,730
Wow. weird vibe.

565
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:42,200
Okay. where's dan?

566
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,230
There's no chance we're related, right? oh, look at eric's roots.

567
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,230
What do you mean? what's wrong with my roots? they're kind of rufus-like.

568
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,230
Hey. serena and blair.

569
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,230
Blair? yeah, it's me.

570
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,630
Explanation to follow, but first,

571
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:58,600
What's going on with our parents? oh, uh, our dad dated your mom.

572
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,100
Yeah, we're not related, though. what?

573
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,770
Ignore my roots. wait. wait. what?

574
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,770
You know what's really weird?

575
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,570
There's a garage door in the middle of your room.

576
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:12,200
Oh. is that cedric? wow. this day just got a lot worse.

577
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,770
Hold on. how serious were they--our parents?

578
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,000
Uh, I think it's safe to say that they have had sex.

579
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,530
Ew. oh. no, no, no. no, I'm gonna faint. to repeat, we are not related.

580
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:25,600
She was a groupie, and he was almost famous. suddenly,

581
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:25,600
My family seems so sane.

582
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,670
This is too much to handle on an empty stomach. well,

583
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,670
We're not going back out there, so...

584
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,300
Well, can we leave here then, please?

585
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,830
Escape. I don't know. maybe eat?

586
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,670
Well, that's why they call it a fire escape.

587
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,670
I think we're splitting hairs here, rufus.

588
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,170
An emotional affair is just as bad as a--as a physical one. oh, please,

589
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,170
Nobody's buying that.

590
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:46,300
Emotional affairs are necessary to keep a marriage alive.

591
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:46,300
And how many times have you been divorced?

592
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,130
Alison, this is not about lily. this is about you and me.

593
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,400
Exactly, and if we're gonna have any chance,

594
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Then she can't be here.

595
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,570
What, for thanksgiving? or ever?

596
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,400
Oh, you can't be serious.

597
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,870
I am.

598
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,870
Look, I have made mistakes, and I know that,

599
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:06,000
But if she's in your life, you're never gonna get over her.

600
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,130
Alison.

601
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,130
This is it, rufus, okay?

602
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,630
If you wanna make this work, then you have to make a choice.

603
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,212
Mom, is such a hypocrite, and all these years,

604
00:31:25,212 --> 00:31:27,952
She's been riding me about my behavior.

605
00:31:25,212 --> 00:31:27,952
And here she's just mad at you for being her.

606
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,482
And all this time, my dad has been giving me this advice

607
00:31:30,482 --> 00:31:33,682
Based on this girl he dated. this girl--"a lot like serena."

608
00:31:33,682 --> 00:31:37,012
It's her mom. when you think about it, it makes total sense

609
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:39,712
That your mom was a groupie. I mean, only a woman

610
00:31:39,712 --> 00:31:42,412
That had completely satisfied her sexual appetite in her youth

611
00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:44,782
Would ever marry your stepdads. blair,

612
00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:44,782
Can we not talk about mom's appetite?

613
00:31:44,782 --> 00:31:47,682
Yeah. or who-- or who satisfied it.  it's just...

614
00:31:47,682 --> 00:31:49,282
So...  gross.

615
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,282
Yeah. hi.

616
00:31:50,282 --> 00:31:52,712
Hey, mom. is everything okay?

617
00:31:52,712 --> 00:31:55,112
Yeah. mm-hmm.

618
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:58,582
Do you--do you wanna go home? we could call a car.

619
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:00,612
Oh, no, not yet. um, I need fries.

620
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:03,082
Excuse me. could I get some french fries?

621
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:05,652
And just keep 'em coming.  sure. coming right up.

622
00:32:07,982 --> 00:32:09,482
Uh, we should--

623
00:32:09,482 --> 00:32:12,082
Jenny and I should probably head back to the loft.

624
00:32:12,082 --> 00:32:15,212
I'm gonna go, too. leave you guys alone.

625
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:20,682
S.

626
00:32:20,682 --> 00:32:24,282
Thank you for today.

627
00:32:24,282 --> 00:32:25,782
The sandwich was delicious.

628
00:32:25,782 --> 00:32:28,012
I'm calling dr. sherman tomorrow.

629
00:32:30,012 --> 00:32:31,212
Bye.

630
00:32:31,212 --> 00:32:32,352
Bye.

631
00:32:37,782 --> 00:32:40,152
Is that really necessary, mom?

632
00:32:40,152 --> 00:32:44,282
From what I hear, you have been in places far dirtier than this.

633
00:32:44,282 --> 00:32:47,282
Well...

634
00:32:47,282 --> 00:32:50,382
Please.

635
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:54,682
Try spending nine hours with jane's addiction

636
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:56,252
On the ohio turnpike.

637
00:32:56,252 --> 00:32:58,982
Then we'll talk about dirty.

638
00:32:58,982 --> 00:33:02,282
Okay.

639
00:33:02,282 --> 00:33:05,552
See you later, waldorf.

640
00:33:09,182 --> 00:33:11,912
So, uh, so today was not boring.

641
00:33:11,912 --> 00:33:13,252
No.

642
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:16,852
I never should have asked mom to come home,

643
00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:18,812
But I didn't see this coming.

644
00:33:18,812 --> 00:33:21,382
Who could've? don't worry about it.

645
00:33:21,382 --> 00:33:24,382
It's so weird to think that our parents had lives before us,

646
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:27,382
You know? I know, or that they had lives before each other, huh?

647
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:28,712
Yeah.

648
00:33:28,712 --> 00:33:31,082
Lily seemed pretty upset.

649
00:33:31,082 --> 00:33:33,652
I wonder what happened while we were gone.

650
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:35,482
Uh, i-i don't know,

651
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:39,112
But it looks like we're about to find out. hey! who's in the mood

652
00:33:39,112 --> 00:33:41,812
For a little humphrey family scrimmage?

653
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,882
What'll it be? kids against the parents?

654
00:33:43,882 --> 00:33:47,152
Boys against the girls? oh, definitely girls against the boys

655
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:50,312
Because last year, I got burned by dan's weak forward pass. hey, hey,

656
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:50,312
I was nursing a rotator cuff injury

657
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:51,812
From aught-5. uh-huh.

658
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:54,812
Aw. come on, mom. let's go work out our plays.

659
00:33:54,812 --> 00:33:56,712
Yep.

660
00:33:56,712 --> 00:33:59,752
So, uh, dad, not that I'm-- not that I'm mad, exactly,

661
00:33:59,752 --> 00:34:02,752
But not telling me about serena's mom

662
00:34:02,752 --> 00:34:04,752
Was extremely uncool.

663
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:07,482
I should've said something, I know. and I'm sorry.

664
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:10,482
Given the ick factor alone, I would say that you set

665
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:14,852
My progress back by at least several months. oh, come on.

666
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:14,852
You're a humphrey man.

667
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,112
No daughter of lily's could ever resist.

668
00:34:17,112 --> 00:34:20,252
How'd you leave it back there with her?

669
00:34:20,252 --> 00:34:22,252
Well, I wouldn't be expecting

670
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:24,212
Lil over for dinner anytime soon.

671
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:27,612
Your mom and I need to focus on the future, not the past.

672
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:32,152
That's a lot easier for all of us without her around.

673
00:34:33,952 --> 00:34:35,212
Well...

674
00:34:35,212 --> 00:34:38,982
Well, let's play with the old pigskin then.

675
00:34:49,112 --> 00:34:51,652
Mom.

676
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:53,252
Here you are.

677
00:34:53,252 --> 00:34:57,052
And here you are. you had me worried sick.

678
00:34:57,052 --> 00:34:59,312
Blair, uh...

679
00:34:59,312 --> 00:35:03,152
I know i-i shouldn't have lied to you about your father.

680
00:35:03,152 --> 00:35:05,752
That never stopped you before.

681
00:35:05,752 --> 00:35:07,382
True.

682
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:10,582
But... the real truth...

683
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:15,252
Divorce papers from your father,

684
00:35:15,252 --> 00:35:19,925
And I'm supposed to sign them. I haven't yet.

685
00:35:19,925 --> 00:35:21,947
Mom...

686
00:35:21,947 --> 00:35:24,047
He's living in europe...

687
00:35:26,263 --> 00:35:27,863
With a man.

688
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:33,293
You can't be all that surprised that he wants a divorce.

689
00:35:33,293 --> 00:35:34,863
I'm not,

690
00:35:34,863 --> 00:35:36,763
But what i--

691
00:35:36,763 --> 00:35:39,863
What I am surprised about is how it makes me feel.

692
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:45,263
He was my husband, after all.

693
00:35:46,793 --> 00:35:49,393
My harold....

694
00:35:49,393 --> 00:35:51,893
For almost 20 years.

695
00:35:53,533 --> 00:35:56,733
I couldn't face him....

696
00:35:56,733 --> 00:35:58,363
During the holidays.

697
00:35:58,363 --> 00:36:00,493
It was always our happiest time.

698
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:02,963
Why didn't you just tell me that?

699
00:36:02,963 --> 00:36:05,563
And let you choose between the two of us?

700
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,593
I wonder who would've won that battle.

701
00:36:07,593 --> 00:36:11,433
Yeah, I would have been entirely alone.

702
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:13,293
Well, uh, I was anyway.

703
00:36:33,893 --> 00:36:35,533
It's still thanksgiving.

704
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:36,863
Yeah.

705
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,933
What do you want to do?

706
00:36:50,863 --> 00:36:52,093
Hey.

707
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:53,593
Oh, you're still here.

708
00:36:53,593 --> 00:36:56,033
I guess I must have fallen back asleep.

709
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:57,863
Yeah, you were, uh,

710
00:36:57,863 --> 00:37:00,893
You were pretty out of it when I first came in.

711
00:37:00,893 --> 00:37:03,033
Where's your mom?

712
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:05,663
She's getting coffee.

713
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:08,233
How's your mom?

714
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:11,533
She's gonna be all right.

715
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:12,993
We all are.

716
00:37:16,263 --> 00:37:19,193
So...

717
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:20,763
Vicodin and whiskey, huh?

718
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:24,563
I guess I forgot I took that medicine when I took that drink.

719
00:37:24,563 --> 00:37:27,363
Dad, we're not doing this anymore.

720
00:37:27,363 --> 00:37:29,993
Okay? we're just not.

721
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:33,963
I know it wasn't an accident.

722
00:37:33,963 --> 00:37:36,293
Of course it was.

723
00:37:36,293 --> 00:37:39,333
And when I found you, I thought you were dead.

724
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,393
I'm sorry.

725
00:37:44,393 --> 00:37:47,163
I just didn't... I couldn't--

726
00:37:47,163 --> 00:37:51,433
Yes, you can. dad, you have to, please.

727
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:54,363
I know it might not always feel that way, but...

728
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,333
We need you.

729
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:02,993
Dad, we need you.

730
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:16,633
Here you go, nate. ah, thank you, mr. waldorf.

731
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:16,633
My dad will appreciate this.

732
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:18,833
It's a pleasure. keep out the gravy. he's got high cholesterol.

733
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:21,693
Anne, it's thanksgiving. mom, seriously.

734
00:38:21,693 --> 00:38:24,763
Give the man some gravy. happy thanksgiving. it's okay.

735
00:38:21,693 --> 00:38:24,763
Happy thanksgiving.

736
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:27,263
Happy thanksgiving. yeah, you, too, man. all right.

737
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,563
See you soon.

738
00:38:29,563 --> 00:38:31,063
Good night, sweetheart.

739
00:38:31,063 --> 00:38:32,393
Good night.

740
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:36,233
Hello. happy thanksgiving.

741
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:37,533
Hey. hi.

742
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:39,063
Happy thanksgiving. you, too.

743
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:40,533
Hi. happy thanksgiving.

744
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:42,063
To you, as well. bye.

745
00:38:42,063 --> 00:38:43,463
Bye.

746
00:38:43,463 --> 00:38:45,133
Hi. happy thanksgiving, blair.

747
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:48,933
I am looking for my daughter. where is my little girl? oh.

748
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:51,963
Hi. um...

749
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,493
Too much turkey?

750
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:23,956
Bye, blair.

751
00:39:23,956 --> 00:39:25,526
Happy thanksgiving.

752
00:39:25,526 --> 00:39:28,086
This time, I went for the ginger tea.

753
00:39:28,086 --> 00:39:29,626
Good.

754
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:36,226
Hello. where were you?

755
00:39:36,226 --> 00:39:38,286
Exquisite. just say it.

756
00:39:38,286 --> 00:39:40,526
Give me my shoe.

757
00:40:00,086 --> 00:40:02,686
Hey, dan, will you pass the mashed? it's over...

758
00:40:02,686 --> 00:40:05,156
Ahem. what? oh, yeah, here. I'm sorry.

759
00:40:05,156 --> 00:40:07,686
Come on, son. you're asleep at the wheel.

760
00:40:07,686 --> 00:40:09,284
The humphrey family thanksgiving dinner's a well-oiled machine.

761
00:40:09,285 --> 00:40:10,526
Were you still thinking about your dream girl?

762
00:40:10,526 --> 00:40:12,226
What? no.

763
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:13,726
Uh-huh. uh-huh.

764
00:40:13,726 --> 00:40:17,526
No, no. no. I'm thinking about, um, your stuffing, mom,

765
00:40:17,526 --> 00:40:18,730
Which looks delicious. mm-hmm. yeah.

766
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,470
Your stuffing. mm-hmm. uh-huh. yeah. well, keep dreaming.

767
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,255
You know, maybe one day she'll actually know your name.

768
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:26,141
Yeah, maybe, and then I'll have something to be thankful for. oh, shut up.

769
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,089
Really. what's that all about?
