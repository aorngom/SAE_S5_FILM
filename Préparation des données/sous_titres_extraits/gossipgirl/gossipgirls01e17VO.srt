00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,940
Previously on Gossip Girl...

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,380
<i>into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite. you're one of my oldest friends.</i>

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,920
that's certainly not how it felt when you kissed me at eleanor's.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,040
he proposed before we left,  and i'm going to say yes.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,930
i'm sure you'll make a beautiful bride.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,070
last night was strange but very fun.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,650
didn't we just say good-bye?

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,000
<i>somehow, you screwing blair for sport is my fault! all right, i know how long</i>

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,580
you and i have been best friends, okay? no, it's not okay. from now on, you stay away from me.

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,620
georgina. what are you doing here? i told you i was coming.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,990
dan of all people cannot know georgie.

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,750
how about, um, dinner tonight with sarah instead? oh, sarah again.

13
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,900
what is she, your new girlfriend or something? she's new in town, and she does want to meet you.

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,200
i'm sarah.

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,650
what do you want from me? i want things to go back to how they were before that night, 

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,030
before things got so screwed up. what's georgina got on you?

17
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,440
<i>what's so bad you can't even tell me? if you put the camera over there, </i>

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,690
<i>she'll never know.</i>

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,940
you can tell me anything. i killed someone.

《绯闻少女》 第一季第17集

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>and who am i?</i>

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>that's a secret i'll never tell.</i>

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>you know you love me.</i>

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>x.o.x.o., gossip girl.</i>

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,560
<i>in our modern age, </i>

28
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,020
<i>when you can call someone and can't find them, </i>

29
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,110
<i>you can pretty much be sure they'll get the message.</i>

30
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,750
hey, s., it's georgie.

31
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,350
listen, i know it's early,  but i thought i'd...

32
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,150
so this is my third call. where are you?

33
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,480
it's me again.

34
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,660
i've left you a couple messages,  and you haven't called me back.

35
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,260
i think we should hang out today. friends hang out.

36
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,530
maybe you've lost your cell phone.

37
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,420
can't wait to see you.

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,620
<i>but if they don't call you back, </i>

39
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,870
<i>it usually means they don't want to be found.</i>

40
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,750
hey, do you think "track me down"

41
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,710
should come before or after "everytime"?

42
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,210
<i>is the "rolling stone" thing tonight? i guess i really am in one</i>

43
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,000
of the top ten forgotten bands of the '90s. it's true. i forgot.

44
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,140
yeah, but a lot of people remember.

45
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,540
there's a reason that issue was one of the highest selling

46
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,480
of the year. and i'm proud, dad. i really am.

47
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,900
you got your follow-up article and a concert, 

48
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,040
surely followed by an overpriced cd

49
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,720
sold at corporate coffeehouses for gen xers

50
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,370
without taste buds... or taste. hey, it's gonna be cool.

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,650
i mean, they're even filming it for vh1. vh1 classics. the "classic" is kind of important.

52
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,550
i'm classic. uh-oh, no retort.

53
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,750
signs of a sleepless night.

54
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,970
disinterest in making your father

55
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,790
feel old and irrelevant...

56
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,650
that can only mean one thing- girl trouble.

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,190
yeah, serena and i,  we had a fight last night-

58
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,800
this new kind we keep having where she says something, 

59
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,480
and i know it's not the whole truth. well,  have you asked her what's really on her mind?

60
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,450
only about 10, 000 times, yeah. yeah, but did you really mean it?

61
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,800
most times, when people don't offer the truth, 

62
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,920
it's because they're afraid of what someone might think.

63
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,200
and i don't know if you know this, 

64
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,220
but you can be a pretty judgmental
guy. so you're saying that i should learn

65
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,640
<i>to be someone else around
her so she can be herself around me?
i couldn't have said it better myself.</i>

66
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,500
thank you, dad.

67
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,260
i'm gonna go find her right now.

68
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,830
see you tonight... both of you.

69
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,760
and here i thought i had your schedule memorized.

70
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,420
i switched shifts and just got off.

71
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,120
i'm dan's dad's roadie for the day, 

72
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,720
so i gotta bail in, like, five.

73
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,250
um, although i don't mind the stalking...

74
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,260
when are you gonna ask me on a real date?

75
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,930
uh...

76
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,780
hold that thought. sorry.

77
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,280
hello?

78
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,690
yeah. yeah, okay,  i'll be right there.

79
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,430
look, i'm sorry. i - i gotta go. so i heard.

80
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,340
no, no, no. it's not what you think. it's just...

81
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,030
what are you doing tonight?

82
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:54,820
uh, me, lincoln hawk,  a dirty van and a lot of cables?

83
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,510
can i meet you at the concert? can you be there at 7:30?

84
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,620
<i>it's a date. finally.</i>

85
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,170
text me the address.

86
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,120
the guests will be checked into their suites

87
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,520
as soon as they arrive.

88
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,410
the walk-through is at 2:00,  and the rehearsal dinner

89
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,730
starts promptly at 7:00 p.m. the in reid salon.

90
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,540
oh, and don't forget.

91
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,750
you have your interview with "rolling stone" in one hour. the interview. how could we forget?

92
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,470
mm-hmm. hey, uh, excuse me, mr. bass, 

93
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,880
ms. van der woodsen. not for long, thank you very much.

94
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,230
morning, daniel. morning.

95
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,340
good morning. have either of you seen serena? she's not upstairs.

96
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,530
uh, ticktock, ticktock,  ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

97
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,080
no. sorry, daniel.

98
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,900
okay.

99
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,010
and her bed hasn't been slept in. well, i knew housekeeping was hiring, 

100
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,170
but i had no idea their standards were so low.

101
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,960
i hate that i have to ask you this, but have you seen serena?

102
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,180
oh, i've seen lots of serena.

103
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,830
are you drunk dialing again?

104
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,890
no, serena didn't come home last night.

105
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,600
i thought she was with you.

106
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,550
hey.

107
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,090
maybe this is blair's idea of a perverse double date.

108
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,360
miss blair asks that you should wait there.

109
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,460
she's on her way now. she's not even here?

110
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,350
well, this oughta be good.

111
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,430
you're not calling me back,  and you're not picking up.

112
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,180
i thought you understood me, 

113
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,540
but maybe i should make myself a little more clear

114
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,970
and come to you. we can talk about it over coffee.

115
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,550
i brought it just the way you like it...

116
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,330
dark but sweet.

117
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,340
oh, no.

118
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,760
hey, sarah!

119
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,160
dan! hey!

120
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,820
oh, my gosh! what a coincidence. yeah. w-what are you doing here?

121
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,520
oh, um, i actually have

122
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,240
an old friend from portland staying here. oh, okay.

123
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,900
what are you doing here? oh, i just-i came looking for serena, but she, uh, 

124
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,320
apparently didn't come home last night, so i-i'm just...

125
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,720
i don't know. i'm trying to figure out what to think.

126
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,050
she's been-well, let's just say she's not been herself lately.

127
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,050
so i-i don't know. i don't know. i don't know what to do exactly. why don't you try giving her a call again?

128
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,420
<i>and when she sees it's you calling, </i>

129
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,790
she'll immediately pick up and tell you all about it.

130
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,870
hey.

131
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,780
hey, i've been lookin' all over for ya.

132
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,470
hey, is-is this dan?

133
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,070
who's this? my name's drew.

134
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,530
i'm the bartender at one oak.

135
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,900
some girl left this phone here last night.

136
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,580
it's been ringing off the hook all morning.

137
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,780
you were the first number on the speed dial, so- some girl? what-what girl?

138
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,470
tall, blonde. left here around 2:00 with 3 guys.

139
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,260
skipped out on her tab,  which was pretty substan-

140
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,130
hey. what is it?

141
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,570
<i>spotted-lonely boy on the upper east side</i>

142
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,570
<i>learning the lesson that nothing stays missing for long.</i>

143
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,230
it's nothing. nothing.

144
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,780
<i>things always turn up,  for better...</i>

145
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,000
well, is something actually wrong, 

146
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,040
or is this just some ploy to get us both here?

147
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,340
i meant what i said on the phone. i need your help.

148
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,250
<i>we need your help.</i>

149
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,290
<i>or for worse.</i>

150
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,690
????

151
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,020
you okay?

152
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,170
what's wrong with her?

153
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,830
take her upstairs. get her upstairs.

154
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,490
dorota! coffee, fast.

155
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,750

156
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,790
here. no. come on, come on. why won't you let me sleep?

157
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,260
we have to keep her talking and awake. come on, come on.

158
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,200
let's go. let's go. dorota,  will you please get her

159
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,550
a fresh change of clothes and a bathrobe? of course, miss blair.

160
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,340
so we have every hangover cure known to man, plus bagels.

161
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:23,960
they should help

162
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,410
soak up the alcohol and whatever else she took.

163
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,470
thank you. i'll take it from here. come on.

164
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,070
come on. come on, serena. help me out.

165
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,840
b., it's cold! it's cold! just like old times.

166
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,190
you know,  why do i get the feeling

167
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,520
you're actually enjoying this?

168
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,490
call me sentimental.

169
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,030
ugh. i may not need those bagels after all. what's going on with her?

170
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,950
she was here last night,  scared.

171
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,230
she... she told me something totally crazy, 

172
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,660
but was too freaked out to find the words to explain it.

173
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,040
i went upstairs to find my mom's valium to calm her down, 

174
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,140
but when i got back,  she was gone.

175
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,740
it took me all night to find her.

176
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,220
what exactly did she say to you?

177
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,200
that's beside the point.

178
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,170
we're here to help serena,  no matter what the problem is.

179
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,660
hey, could you maybe read that somewhere else?

180
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,620
i don't like the "post." is that why you subscribe?

181
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,310
another thing i don't like-my son depressed.

182
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,050
i don't know if you've talked to him recently... we've talked.

183
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,010
he and serena- should i be worried?

184
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,970
it's been a little bumpy lately, sure.

185
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,890
i think the most recent bump is our friend sarah.

186
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,860
serena's a little jealous,  but sarah's cool, 

187
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,260
so as soon as serena gets to know her, 

188
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,170
everything will be fine.

189
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,730
<i>i love that picture of you!</i>

190
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,140
yeah, me, too.

191
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,960
tell me where you took this photograph, 

192
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,140
what undoubtedly could be called

193
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,850
the band's most well-known image? uh, well, i wouldn't go that far.

194
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,780
well, i would. it's positively iconic.

195
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,500
were you and rufus humphrey already involved

196
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,130
when you took it? excuse me?

197
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,410
rufus humphrey,  lead singer of lincoln hawk.

198
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,020
or... was this before or after - oh, well, i simply don't feel comfortable

199
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,470
<i>discussing anything other than my work. i was talking about your work.</i>

200
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,070
why'd you give up photography?

201
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,590
was it too hard to continue shooting

202
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,530
after you had broken his heart?

203
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,720
um, just-just a moment, please.

204
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,610
oh. you know, i see i'm interrupting, so i'll...

205
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,600
no, i have to say

206
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,620
i have never been happier to see you, dan.

207
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,440
oh.

208
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,350
well, i've been waiting downstairs for serena.

209
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,500
i- i figured she has to come home... sometime soon.

210
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,160
so have you heard from her? have you tried calling?

211
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,290
pretty sure she lost her phone. well, charles said

212
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,900
he was going over to blair's to pick her up

213
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,180
right after you left earlier. maybe try there.

214
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,680
ah, yes. "charles." charles. of course. thank you so much.

215
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,880
mm-hmm.

216
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,060
listen, i really appreciate your coming

217
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,520
all the way to the palace to conduct this interview, 

218
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,400
but i'm simply gonna have to ask you to leave

219
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,720
because i have a wedding to attend-my own. do you think you were able

220
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,370
to take such incredible photos of rufus humphrey

221
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,850
because of how much you were in love with him?

222
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,820
well, i wasn't in- in love with him...

223
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,680
um... that much.

224
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,060
thank you for your time.

225
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,250
mm.

226
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,760
dorota, can you bring the towels upstairs?

227
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,630
what's taking so long?

228
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,000
huh. guess i missed a chapter.

229
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,760
or... four. don't, uh...

230
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,430
don't all of you hate each other?

231
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,150
yes. absolutely.

232
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,390
no. well, that's fascinating

233
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,060
and ripe for a psychiatrist's case study somewhere, 

234
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,210
but, um,  i am looking for serena.

235
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,970
she's not here.

236
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,870
i think she is.

237
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,180
no, she just left. you must've crossed paths.

238
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,660
i- i-i don't believe you.

239
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,020
fine.

240
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,080
i- i didn't want to have to tell you this, but...

241
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,300
she doesn't want to see you.

242
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,690
come on. really?

243
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,240
yes.

244
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,280
really.

245
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,460
serena! she's telling the truth.

246
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,590
are you really gonna stop me from seeing my girlfriend?

247
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,770
whoa, man. come on.

248
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,470
what are you doing?

249
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,210
s.?

250
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,750
it's okay.

251
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,920
what's happening?

252
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,520
dan... something is going on, 

253
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,960
and i just want to be let in on what it is.

254
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,420
it's hard to explain.

255
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,140
why don't i make it easy for you?

256
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,750
i know you're keeping something from me, 

257
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,980
and i'm sick of being the only one you don't talk to about it.

258
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,340
<i>i'm not talking to anyone. then what are they doing here, </i>

259
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,010
while-while i get a call from a bartender who says

260
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,010
you left a bar at 2:00 in morning with a bunch of guys?

261
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,300
what guys, serena?

262
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,600
who-who were they?

263
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,810
i don't know.

264
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,490
did something happen last night?

265
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,730
please don't.

266
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,570
is that-is that what you're so afraid to tell me, 

267
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,480
that you cheated on me?

268
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,560
<i>did you cheat on me last night?</i>

269
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,220
all i need is a yes or a no. did you sleep with someone else?

270
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,650
yes.

271
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,350
yeah.

272
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,370
i'm done.

273
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,360
hey.

274
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,590
hey! did you find serena?

275
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,740
yeah, but i-i, uh,  i kinda wish i hadn't.

276
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,810
that doesn't sound so good.

277
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,090
i'm just in the park.

278
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,600
wanna meet me,  maybe talk about it?

279
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,610
i'm a pretty good listener.

280
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,610
dan?

281
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,500
yeah. yeah, i'd, uh,  i'd like that.

282
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,550
well, i wanted cymbidiums,  not hyacinth.

283
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,100
and why did we choose fish? it's unseasonably warm.

284
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,190
you know, i knew we should've gone with the limoges

285
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,350
instead of the lenox.

286
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,600
what's the matter? you were fine this morning.

287
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,090
now you're finding fault with everything.

288
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,450
nothing. nothing at all. i'm just...

289
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,350
i've had three perfect weddings,  and i want this one

290
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,580
to be more perfect than perfect,  that's all.

291
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,950
oh, finally.

292
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,370
so why are you still at blair's?

293
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,750
you're supposed to be here.

294
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,700
ms. van der woodsen, it is dorota, ms. waldorf's - i know who you are, dorota, 

295
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,610
but this is not a very good time.

296
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,730
oh, the wedding. i know. miss serena is here.

297
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,270
oh, yes, i know. i've heard several times today.

298
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,310
i know it's not my place,  but...

299
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,730
miss serena is...

300
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,580
like the old days.

301
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,090
what are you trying to say?

302
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,460
i think you should have worry about your daughter, 

303
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,090
worry like before she went away.

304
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,740
well, um... thank you, dorota. i'll take care of it.

305
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,890
i am so sorry,  but i'm gonna have to go.

306
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,830
where do you have to go?

307
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,260
to do something i've done too many times before.

308
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,160
can i help you? no. thank you. i'll have to do it alone. mwah.

309
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,580
i can't believe i just did that.

310
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,240
<i>then why did you? i mean, did you cheat on dan?</i>

311
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,730
no. i remember last night. i didn't do anything.

312
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,450
then why would you say that to him? because i would rather

313
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,560
dan think i cheated on him than know what i really did.

314
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,790
<i>what you really did?</i>

315
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,090
dan puts me on a pedestal.

316
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,190
if he knew the truth, he would never look at me again.

317
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,450
<i>you're starting to scare even me. what did you do?</i>

318
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,940
come on. you can tell us.

319
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:11,830
we've seen you with vomit in your hair, 

320
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,290
making out with investment bankers

321
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,080
in the men's room at p.j. clarke's.

322
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,910
you don't have to hide anything from us. she's right, serena. i mean, none of us are saints.

323
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,270
yeah, i had sex with him in the back of a limo. several times.

324
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,030
<i>i had sex with you at a wedding while i was her date.</i>

325
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,890
once.

326
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,560
i'm chuck bass.

327
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,040
you can tell us anything. we don't judge.

328
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,420
we're the non-judging breakfast club.

329
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,000
we're your best friends.

330
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,470
anything you do is something we did, too.

331
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,560
if i tell you,  it can never leave this room.

332
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,170
you all know georgina sparks. some of us better than others.

333
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,690
it's not like you didn't lose your virginity to her

334
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,920
in seventh grade. sixth, actually,  and i've been avoiding her ever since.

335
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,780
the bitch is a psycho. what about her?

336
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,140
well, something happened

337
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,370
the night of the shepherd wedding.

338
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,700
i think we're all aware of what happened that night. no, something else, 

339
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,070
something i've tried to escape,  but georgina won't let me.

340
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,810
and now she's blackmailing me.

341
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,720
blackmailing you? with what exactly?

342
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,930
well...

343
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,530
it started when blair thought you and i had too much to drink.

344
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,130
she told us to go outside,  get some air, sober up.

345
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,880
oh, if the happy couple didn't want

346
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,730
to put up the cash for the premium bar, 

347
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,480
they should've made their wedding b.y.o.b.

348
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,170
<i>instead,  we went into the empty bar, </i>

349
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,640
<i>i opened the bottle of champagne, and we... well...</i>

350
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,000
we can skip that part, okay?

351
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,460
go ahead. i'll fill her in later.

352
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,090
i left in a hurry.

353
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,010
<i>i felt so terrible, </i>

354
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,320
<i>so guilty for what i had just done.</i>

355
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,190
<i>i just-i had to get out of there.</i>

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
eastview hotel, please.

357
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,280
<i>georgina and i had plans to meet up after, </i>

358
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,170
<i>so i headed straight to her.</i>

359
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,500
<i>little did i know she had a surprise waiting for me.</i>

360
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,670
<i>she's gonna lose her mind.</i>

361
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,280
<i>a genuine</i>

362
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,800
<i>serena van der woodsen sex tape...</i>

363
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,670
<i>how are we gonna do this, exactly?</i>

364
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,540
<i>well, if you put the camera over there, </i>

365
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,210
<i>she'll never know.</i>

366
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,530
<i>are you sure she's gonna be down for this?</i>

367
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,310
it's serena. she goes down foranything.

368
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,780
hey, baby. how are the new mr. and mrs. shepherd?

369
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,050
<i>i didn't know it at the time, </i>

370
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,880
<i>but she was taping me.</i>

371
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,830
lucky for me,  i was-i was too stuck

372
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,750
on what had just happened to be much fun for anyone.

373
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,790
i can't believe i just did that. blair's my best friend.

374
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,090
what-what sort of person does that to her best friend?

375
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,080
all right, this is a therapy session, g.

376
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,470
you promised a party.

377
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,670
so break out the favors.

378
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,480
jing!

379
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,630
thank you.

380
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,290
oh. i don't- i don't feel so good.

381
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,920
she always gets frisky after she hurls.

382
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,440
<i>no, pete.</i>

383
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,430
i'm not in the mood, okay? come on.

384
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,100
<i>i'm hot, okay?</i>

385
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,620
i'm-i'm too hot. oh, you are too hot.

386
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,280
no, it's-it's hot. why is it so hot in here?

387
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:47,370
<i>* a pawn, a shove,  an eerie love *</i>

388
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,380
<i>* a whip, a crack</i>

389
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,880
<i>* you won't come back</i>

390
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,480
<i>* with your hook and line,  i still blow away *</i>

391
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,730
<i>* with your hook and line</i>

392
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,940
what is it?

393
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,160
i can't.

394
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,350
yes. yes, you can.

395
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,470
i'm scared.

396
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,780
we're right here.

397
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,530
no. you know, i can't. i can't. i can't do this, pete. okay?

398
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,390
i can't. um...

399
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,390
yeah, how about, um...

400
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,970
how about we do a couple lines first, okay?

401
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,720
whatever, baby.

402
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,180
here. go ahead. okay.

403
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,510
ahh.

404
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,030
pete?

405
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,770
pete, are you okay?

406
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,050
pete, what's happening? are you okay? georgie.

407
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,460
georgie! georgina!

408
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,590
what? why are you screaming?

409
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,920
what are you doing? i'm calling 9-1-1.

410
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,670
you-you can't!

411
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,830
there's drugs everywhere. we could get in so much trouble.

412
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,030
we can get arrested. we have to go. no! we can't leave him!

413
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,730
<i>we have to. get everything out that has you on it. go. oh, my god. oh, my god.</i>

414
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,410
oh, my god.

415
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,750
where's his phone? where's his phone?

416
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,120
what are you doing? i'm calling.

417
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,000
hello. 9-1-1 emergency. hi, uh, we have an emergency.

418
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,750
uh, can you send someone right away to the eastview hotel?

419
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,080
room, uh, 1411, please. there's a guy. he's having seizures.

420
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,250
i don't know what's wrong. get off the phone! we have to go!

421
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,340
ma'am, i'm gonna need your name and, uh...

422
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,770
hello? hello, ma'am? are you there?

423
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,180
so georgina told me we had to split up.

424
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,080
then she said that people might be looking for us.

425
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,850
but i-i couldn't go. i just couldn't.

426
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,960
<i>so i-i waited near the hotel,  across the street.</i>

427
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,400
<i>all i wanted was to see the paramedics helping pete.</i>

428
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,900
<i>but that's not what i saw.</i>

429
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,810
<i>i didn't know what to do.</i>

430
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:17,110
<i>i- i just knew i had to leave right away.</i>

431
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,280
<i>i- i took a train</i>

432
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,040
heading north, and i got a room and convinced my mom

433
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,640
that boarding school was a good idea, and...

434
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,940
never said good-bye.

435
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,660
it makes sense now.

436
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,960
but what does she even want from you?

437
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,180
well, when she came back,  i- i told her that i moved on

438
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,120
from the lifestyle that she was still in, 

439
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,380
but she didn't like that.

440
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,990
so somehow, she became friends with dan and-and vanessa

441
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,580
and-and called herself "sarah."

442
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,700
why don't you just tell dan about her?

443
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,970
because she has that tape of me,  and she'll use it.

444
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,030
it's practically a snuff film.

445
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:57,720
we need to find her. no. please.

446
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,850
promise me, please.

447
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,500
promise me you won't do anything.

448
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,380
because if you do,  then she'll show dan...

449
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,000
if he even ever speaks to me again.

450
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,310
<i>watch out, s.</i>

451
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,220
<i>just because you finally tell the truth</i>

452
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,540
<i>doesn't mean there won't be consequences.</i>

453
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,350
god. what have i done?

454
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,470
sylvia. how are you?

455
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,510
i'm wonderful.

456
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,090
good to see you again. so good to see you, too.

457
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,030
thanks for coming with me, b.

458
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,250
i'm really not feeling up to being social. of course.

459
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,060
oh. excuse me.

460
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,350
incoming.

461
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,470
you were supposed to be home hours ago. come with me.

462
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,110
i- i'm-i'm sorry, mom. and you look beautiful.

463
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,610
i hope you don't mind. i asked blair to come tonight.

464
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,070
what happened to you last night? why didn't you come home?

465
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,640
why was dan looking for you all morning?

466
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,990
and why did i get a call

467
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,390
informing me that you were on drugs? i wasn't on drugs.

468
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,960
don't lie to me.

469
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,650
i saw that little home movie that you and your friends made.

470
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,650
you-you watched that? well, only part of it.

471
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,490
i stopped when that guy had his tongue down your throat.

472
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,800
but i can pretty much guess how it ends.

473
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,760
no, it-it-it was just a joke. we were kidding.

474
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,670
it's not what it looked like. you know what? you are out of control.

475
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,560
i always knew you had a wild side.

476
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,620
but how can you look at yourself?

477
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,780
what have you become?

478
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,430
i thought we were past all of this, serena.

479
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,540
i thought you were doing so well.

480
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,510
i have nothing left

481
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,200
but to send you to reformatory school.

482
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,830
what do you think about that?

483
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,980
what's wrong? what happened?

484
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,950
hey, guys. sorry to interrupt. tuned to f-sharp minor.

485
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,470
and, lisa, sheckman told me to tell you you're almost up.

486
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,480
okay. thanks. thanks, vanessa.

487
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,550
hey.

488
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,870
hey. this is incredible, dad.

489
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,580
i hope you're sufficiently nervous, 

490
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,080
'cause there's, like,  a hundred people out there, 

491
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,060
which is 80 more than the last time you played, i think?

492
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,930
lisa, this is my sarcastic son dan and his friend sarah. hey. nice to meet ya.

493
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,910
pleasure.

494
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,900
hi. hi

495
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,990
i'll see y'all later. okay.

496
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,460
yeah. ah, no serena?

497
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:38,350
i'll take good care of him,  mr. humphrey. promise.

498
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,760
uh, jenny's already called me about 15 times from mom's

499
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,860
<i>to make sure that i call her during "something like that"</i>

500
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:46,770
so she can hear you mess up the bridge. so break a leg.

501
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,270
i'll be in the front row. okay. okay.

502
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,760
hey, georgina!

503
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,570
georgina.

504
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,240
uh, i think she thinks she knows you.

505
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,590
i've never seen her before in my life.

506
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,610
um, let's go get a drink.

507
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,500
don't send her away.

508
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,820
blair, it's-it's, uh, not polite to interrupt. i don't care who hears.

509
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,200
just don't send her away. excuse me.

510
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,250
thank you, blair, but it's not exactly your business

511
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,840
what i do with my daughter.

512
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,500
if anything,  you're one of the reasons

513
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,600
i'm having to take such strong actions.

514
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,640
i say this with all due respect, lily, 

515
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,830
but you have no idea what your daughter's been going through.

516
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,930
she's in a lot of pain, 

517
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,180
<i>and i don't think the pain's gonna go away if she goes away.</i>

518
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,260
i don't understand what you're trying to tell me.

519
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,100
serena has a secret, 

520
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,500
and she's been holding on to it for a long, long time.

521
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,160
and now it's finally catching up with her.

522
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,170
i- i'm out of my league here.

523
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,620
i can't do any more than i've done, 

524
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,690
and it's not enough.

525
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,180
<i>she needs you. i saw the video.</i>

526
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,360
she doesn't need me. she needs boundaries.

527
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,020
what you saw isn't the whole story.

528
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,720
hey, v., it's me.

529
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,890
you're not calling to cancel,  are you?

530
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,060
because waiting 20 minutes before the concert

531
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,270
maybe isn't the best way to let a girl down.

532
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,290
no, i'm calling to let you know i may be ten minutes late

533
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,390
because-drumroll, please-

534
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,460
i'm actually gonna take the subway to the show.

535
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,210
subway, huh? nate archibald,  man of the people.

536
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,850
oh. well, thank you.

537
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,200
uh, and your name's on the list,  but if you don't see me, 

538
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,970
just look for dan and our friend sarah.

539
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,250
they'll know where i am. wait, sarah's there? with dan?

540
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,480
as strange as it may seem,  dan is here.

541
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,460
it is his dad's gig. no, no,  no. i'm not talking about dan.

542
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,460
i'm talking about sarah.

543
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,720
okay, now you're totally weirding me out.

544
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,200
sarah is not her real name. it's georgina.

545
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,170
serena just told us this really messed up story about her.

546
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,290
just do not trust anything she says, please.

547
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,110
wh-what are you talking about?

548
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,260
listen, i'll tell you what i can when i get there, okay?

549
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,790
<i>okay.</i>

550
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,780
okay. i'll see you soon.

551
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,510
excuse me.

552
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,700
here's the address you asked for.

553
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,810
thank you, charles. um, excuse us.

554
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,170
hello? hey, i only have a second.

555
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,010
i'm on my way to queens. ugh. gross. why?

556
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,160
to meet vanessa at a concert. it got grosser.

557
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,160
we've been hanging out.

558
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,250
<i>not that i owe you any explanation, </i>

559
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,510
<i>but i do feel like i should tell you</i>

560
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:29,190
apparently, georgina's with her and dan. she-she's there?

561
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,740
yeah. and you know serena doesn't want us to do anything, 

562
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,240
but i just thought you might want to know.

563
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,970
where are you right now?

564
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,470
uh, 74th and lex.

565
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,090
don't move. pick you up in ten.

566
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,220
i have to go handle this thing with serena.

567
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,470
now? yes, now.

568
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,390
it's our rehearsal dinner,  and you're the bride.

569
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,200
i know, but i'm also a mother,  and...

570
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,210
that's more important.

571
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,870
so your problems are my problems.

572
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,840
let me come and help.

573
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,430
i can't. i, uh... i wish i could explain.

574
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,500
there seems to be a lot lately that you can't explain.

575
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,110
i'm sorry. but this is between me and my daughter.

576
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,810
what's gotten into you?

577
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:22,420
what if i told you i knew where georgina sparks was right now?

578
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,440
i'd say,  let's get the bitch.

579
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,430
<i>spotted-blair and chuck</i>

580
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,410
<i>reunited to defend serena's honor.</i>

581
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,810
<i>with friends like these,  who needs armies?</i>

582
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,370
so where are we?

583
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,210
it's the fairman's house.

584
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:46,230
this is where the boy who died grew up, 

585
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,550
and his parents are expecting you. mom, i can't go in there.

586
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,950
sweetie...

587
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,770
if i've learned anything in life, 

588
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,420
it is that sometimes things get in your path, 

589
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,870
and you have a choice-

590
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,300
you can either smash right into them, 

591
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
or you can adjust and move around, 

592
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,110
but you have to do one or the other

593
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:11,310
in order to move forward. how can i do this?

594
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:15,190
i'm gonna be right by your side.

595
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:19,990
ladies and gentlemen, 

596
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,720
how about a round of applause for lisa loeb?

597
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,330
b?

598
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,850
hey, everyone. how you doing?

599
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,250
i'm lisa loeb,  and i'm your host for tonight, 

600
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,130
and i am so happy you're all here.

601
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,490
thanks so much for coming.

602
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,160
i didn't realize you'd be able to hang during the concert.

603
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:43,200
do you have something you want to say to me? not that i know of.

604
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,550
you sure about that... georgina?

605
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,320
my friend says serena told him some story about you, 

606
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,970
and he's on his way to fill me in, 

607
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,450
unless you want to do that first?

608
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,150
i don't know what you're talking about.

609
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,500
i'm not a big fan of liars, 

610
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,090
and neither is dan.

611
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,240
i'm giving you a chance to explain yourself here.

612
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,790
where's sarah going?

613
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,090
i don't know who she is.

614
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,650
nate just called me and said her name is georgina. that's what that girl-

615
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,920
that's what that girl back there called her.

616
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,840
why would she lie about her name? i think there's some other stuff, too.

617
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,670
vanessa, rufus can't find the set list.

618
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,180
do you know where it is? i taped it into the top of his gibson case.

619
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,370
uh, i'll get it.

620
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,700
this will just take two minutes.

621
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,200
just don't go anywhere. stay right here.

622
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,610
i'll be right back.

623
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,470
you okay?

624
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,620
no.

625
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,840
no, i feel terrible, mom.

626
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,320
oh, you heard what they said.

627
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,930
look, peter was an addict for ten years.

628
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,170
his own parents couldn't get him to stop using.

629
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,130
there's no way that a 16-year-old girl could have.

630
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,340
they don't hold you responsible.

631
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,920
you don't need to blame yourself.

632
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,460
<i>but i am responsible, mom.</i>

633
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,900
i'm the one that gave him the line that killed him.

634
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,270
look, serena,  those were his drugs, okay?

635
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,230
if you hadn't given them to him, 

636
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,680
he would have taken them himself.

637
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,170
then why do i still feel like this?

638
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,380
because contrary to what i might have said earlier, 

639
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,430
you are a good person who, since that night, 

640
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,240
has been living your life with care and compassion

641
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:48,670
and respect for yourself and for others.

642
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,300
i'm sorry i doubted you.

643
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,470
thank you.

644
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,490
there's something else i have to do.

645
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,770
will you help me?

646
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,320
absolutely.

647
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,800
take me to see dan.

648
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,820
* you say

649
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,050
* i only hear what i want to

650
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,090
* and i thought what i felt was simple *

651
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,800
okay, so your name is really georgina.

652
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:36,550
well, i don't understand

653
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,700
why you felt like you had to lie to us.

654
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,900
because... my boyfriend-

655
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,650
well, my ex-boyfriend- when we broke up, 

656
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,150
he wasn't too happy about it, 

657
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,320
and things got out of control.

658
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,630
okay, well, what happened?

659
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,230
* i only hear what i want to

660
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,470
i came home one day,  and...

661
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,060
my car was broken into, 

662
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,410
and then a week later,  my room was trashed, 

663
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,630
and i got really scared.

664
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,760
i changed all my numbers,  i moved in with a friend, 

665
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,060
and yet he still tracked me down.

666
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,420
it was my mom's idea

667
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,990
to change my name and move out of town.

668
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,790
i hate being away from my family, 

669
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:29,540
but... it's better than getting hurt, right?

670
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,330
yeah, right.

671
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,990
i'm sorry i didn't tell you.

672
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,400
i just-i wasn't supposed to tell anybody.

673
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,270
no, no, no. no. no. i- i get that. i get it.

674
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,160
* and i thought i'd live forever *

675
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,930
and i also didn't want you to think less of me, 

676
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,620
because i haven't wanted to admit it, 

677
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,910
but, um...

678
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,070
from the moment that i met you,  i've been falling for you.

679
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,750
oh, my god. i'm sorry.

680
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,410
i'm sorry. i don't- i don't know what i'm saying.

681
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,590
