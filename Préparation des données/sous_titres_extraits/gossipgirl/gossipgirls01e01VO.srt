just like mom wants, huh?what do i want, baby?

140
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,000
for serena to sleep in her own bed, possibly wearing pajamas.

-and you're worried it's gonna cost you "mom of the year"?
-serena, you've been gone,

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,500
that i could have one.sounds very fair. the sweatshops could learn a thing or two.

175
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
dad, this is not a platform

176
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
for one of your anticapitalist rants.yes, it is.

177
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,000
besides, you make us go to private school.that's for your education.

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
so we should just be anonymous losers who eat lunch alone

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,400
-and never get invited to parties?
-works for me.

180
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,400
mom thinks it's a good idea.and her judgment is always sound, right?

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,600
jenny, you wanna go to that party, you should go.

182
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,400
you kids could use some fun.

183
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,200
nate?

184
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,300
oh, hey.

185
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,300
uh, your mom told me

186
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,700
you guys were staying here at the palace.

187
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
yeah, uh,we're renovating again.

188
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,700
you know my mom--if it's not broke, break it.

189
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,100
so what are you doing here?

190
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,800
oh, i just wanted to see how you were.

191
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,400
you seemed kind of upset last night.

192
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,800
i-i gotta get going and change for school. i'm gonna be late.serena--

193
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
no. no.

194
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,100
but you're back now--i didn't come back for you.

195
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,300
look, blair's my best friend,and you're her boyfriend,

196
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,400
and she loves you.

197
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,200
that's the way things are supposed to be.

198
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,700
hey,watch where yore gng!

199
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
serena looked effing hot last night.

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
there's something wrong with that level of perfection.

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,700
it needs to be violated.

202
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:10,000
you're telling me if you had the chance--i have a girlfriend.

203
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
you guys have been dating since kindergarten

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,400
and you haven't sealed the deal.

205
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,400
who says, "seal the deal"?

206
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,900
come on.

207
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,600
are you following us or something?

208
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,400
no, i-i go to your school.

209
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,800
identical uniforms?is that kind of a tip-off?

210
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,100
that's funny.

211
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,700
so you guys wanna sit together at lunch?

212
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,000
so cute! these should be framed or something.

213
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,900
not bad work.

214
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,300
and here's yours, as promised.

215
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,500
thanks.

216
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,100
hey.

217
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,000
here you guys are.

218
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,600
i looked all over the dining hall for you.

219
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,600
oh, hi, i'm serena.

220
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,400
i know.i mean, hi, i'm jenny.

221
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,200
hi.

222
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,900

224
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,500
saturday.

225
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,100
and...you're kinda not invited...

226
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,700
since until 12 hours ago,

227
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,300
everyone thought you were at boarding school.

228
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,100
now we're full, and, uh,jenny used up all the invites.

229
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,400
um, actually--you can go now.

230
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,100
sorry.

231
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,900
no, that's okay.

232
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,900
i got a lot of stuff to do anyway.

233
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
well,we should get going then.

234
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,900
unless you want us to wait for you.

235
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,700
looks like you got a lot of yogurt left.no, go ahead.

236
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,600
blair,think we could meet tonight?

237
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,300
i'd love to,

238
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,800
but i'm doing something with nate tonight.

239
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,200
the palace. 8:00?

240
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,800
<i>nate will wait.spotted on the steps of the met--</i>

241
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,800
<i>an s. and b. power struggle.</i>

242
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,000
i could probably do a half-hour.

243
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,700
<i>did s. think she could waltz home,</i>

244
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,900
<i>and things would be just like they were?
-thanks for making the time.</i>

245
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,200
you're my best friend.

246
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,000
<i>did b. think s.would go down without a fight?</i>

247
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,900
<i>or can these two hotties work it out?</i>

248
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,300
<i>there's nothing gossip gir</i>

249
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,200
<i>than a good catfight,</i>

250
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,000
<i>and this could be a classic.</i>

251
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,600
uh, you know--you know, dad,

252
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,000
there's this thing called myspace

253
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,000
n wheryou capost all this information online.

254
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,000
save some trees. have a blog.

255
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,600
maybe if musicians got off their blogs

256
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
and picked up their guitars,

257
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,400
the music business would be in better shape.

258
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,000
-spoken like a true relic.
-thanks, son.

259
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,100
hey, dad, listen, um, i gotta run. are you gonna be okay?

260
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,600
yeah. yeah,your mom will be back.

261
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,000
she's always been a free spirit.

262
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,800
that's one of the reasons i fell for her in the first place.

263
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,000
i meant with the fliers.

264
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,100
luckily,staple guns are old school.

265
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
* sing* na, na, na, na

266
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,000
go. i'm gonna be fine.all right.

267
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,000
* na, na, na, na

268
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,800
i talked to the nurse,and i'm kidnapping you.we're going shopping,

269
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,000
we're going to bendel's, just for an hour, though, i swear.

270
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,500
i had a really bad day.really? 'cause i had a day--

271
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,300
a couple of pills,bunch of rorschach tests.

272
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,100
they had this green jell-o for lunch.mmm! why didn't you save me any?

273
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,700
we gotta get you out of here before mom shows up.

274
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,800
jenny, what is it?

275
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,700
what's wrong?

276
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
do you like this on me?

277
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,400
<i>wait--wait a second.is that why you needed me?</i>

278
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,900
<i>i thought this was an emergency.a fashion emergency.</i>

279
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,500
i mean come on, i've never been to a big dance before.neither have i.

280
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,900
yeah, but mom's gone, and dad's allergic to department stores.

281
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,400
well, you look good, jen.

282
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,500
you do, really.

283
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,900
thanks.

284
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,900
i mean, too bad it's more than our rent,

285
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,900
but i think i can sew something like it.

286
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,700
oh, my gosh, it's serena.

287
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
hi, serena!

288
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,700

stylist and personal shopper eric. hi.

292
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,000
uh, hi.um, this is my brother.

293
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,200
or...

294
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,600
um, so is--is that your dress for the kiss on the lips party?

295
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,700
sort of.

296
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,300
speaking of that, um, here.

297
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,000
i made you one during free period,

298
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,500
but if anyone asks where you got it, i know nothing.

299
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
thanks.

300
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,100
dan? dan?

301
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,900
jenny?

302
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,200
that dress would look even better in black.

303
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,300
black. cool. thanks.

304
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,200
* all the ladies say hey *

305
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,800
this is some good stuff.

306
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,900
yeah, i'm gonna need it.

307
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,800
blair's mom's at the country house.

308
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,800
yeah? well, then maybe i should swipe some of my dad's viagra...

309
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,900
or my mom's paxil?

310
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,300
nathaniel, you're finally about to have sex

311
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,100
with your girlfriend.

312
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,800
it's like you're headed to your execution.

313
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
no, man, i'm good.

314
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,200
talk to chuck, buddy.

315
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,100
you and blair have been dating forever.

316
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,400
-all of a sudden there's a problem?
-there's no problem.

317
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,600
it's just...

318
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,200
do you ever feel like

319
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
our whole lives have been planned out for us,

320
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,800
that we're just gonna end up like our parents?

321
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,300
man, that's a dark thought.

322
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,400
and aren't we entitled to choose, just to be happy?look, easy, socrates.

323
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,500
what we're entitled to is a trust fund,

324
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,200
maybe a house in the hamptons,a prescription drug problem.

325
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,100
but happiness does not seem to be on the menu,

326
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,100
so smoke up and seal the deal with blair,

327
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,600
'cause you're also entitled to tap that ass.

328
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,800
so how's your mom doing with the divorce and everything?

329
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,700
great.

330
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,900
so my dad left her for another man.

331
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,700
she lost 15 pounds,got an eye lift.

332
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,100
-it's been good for her.
-i'm really sorry.

333
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,300
yeah, i could tell,since you didn't call or write

334
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,600
the entire time it was happening.

335
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,800
no, i-i know, i was just--boarding school is like--i don't even know why

336
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,600
you went to boarding school to being with.

337
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,000
do you know how it felt

338
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,000
calling your house when you didn't show up at school

339
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,800
and having your mom say,"serena didn't tell you

340
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,200
that she moved to connecticut?"

341
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,700
i just...i-i had to go. i just--

342
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,300
i needed to get away from everything.

343
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,100
please, just trust me.

344
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,300
how can i trust you when i feel like i don't even know you?

345
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,300
let's fix that.

346
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,500
i saw you at school with--with katy and is,

347
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,400
and i-i get it.

348
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,600
i-i don't want to take any of that away from you--

349
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,700
<i>because it's just yours to take if you want it.</i>

350
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,300
no, that--that's not what i mean. i...

351
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,800
i miss you.

352
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,500
i just want things to go back to the way they used to be--

353
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,400
you know,walking to school together,

354
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,700
dancing on tables at bungalow,

355
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,800
night swimming at your mom's country house.

356
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,000
you were like my sister.

357
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,600
you know,and with our families...

358
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,200
we need each other.

359
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,600
well...

360
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,800
you missed some classic eleanor waldorf meltdowns.

361
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,900
if it wasn't such a tragedy,it would've been funny.

362
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,900
actually, it kind of was.

363
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,200
hmm, well, i wish i could've been there.

364
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,100
you are now.

365
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,800
i have to meet nate.

366
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,700
kinda have something special planned.

367
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,000
well, i don't want to keep you, but, um...

368
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,900
i love you, b.

369
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,600
i love you, too, s.

370
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,300
<i>spotted at the palace hotel--</i>

371
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,100
<i>s. and b.having a heart-to-heart.</i>

372
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,200
<i>hmm, why so thirsty, s.?</i>

373
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,500
<i>you may have won over b. for now,</i>

374
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,000
<i>but we still think you're hiding something.</i>

375
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,100
hey.

376
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,400
ah,the invisible man returns.

377
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,300
you know, i really had no idea you could move that fast.

378
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,500
yeah, well, uh, your fashion emergency was solved,

379
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,200
-so i figured my work was done.
-come on, dan.

380
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,000
serena said hi to you
at a ninth grade birthday party,

381
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
-and you've never forgotten it.
-how could i? she was

382
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,500
and i'm pretty sure she thought i was someone else.

383
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,000
you know,she's actually nice.

384
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,100
<i>and if she did know you,i think she'd really like you.</i>

385
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,800
i don't know. i think she might be a tad overwhelmed

386
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,900
by the glitz and the glamour of the humphrey lifestyle.

387
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
well, i heard she's living at the palace hotel...

388
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,800
well, my--my point exactly.

389
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
probably sitting at the bar by herself,

390
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,900
sipping martinis, all alone.

391
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,900
you know,it's actually kind of sad.

392
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,500
oh, and, um, dad's at the gallery working late.

393
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,000
he, uh,left money for dinner,

394
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,800
so i was thinking indian.

395
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,100
you know--you know what?i think i'm...

396
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,500
i'm gonna go out.

397
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,600
ok

398
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,400
good,'cause i already ordered

399
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,800
and only got enough for one.

400
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,300
move, please.

401
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,300
i love this town.

402
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,200
i'm going to have to tell my parents

403
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,700
the hotel they just bought is serving minors.

404
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,700
and if you get a drink,they're also serving pigs.

405
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,400
-i love it when you talk dirty.
-you just love

406
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,800
actually, i prefer them when they're not talking.

407
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,700
mm, i've missed your witty banter.

408
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,300
let's catch up, take our clothes off, stare at each other.

409
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,600
how about i just get a bite to eat?

410
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,300
i've been drinking on an empty stomach.

411
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,000
i heard you didn't do that anymore.

412
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,700
special occasion.

413
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,300
oh.

414
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,300
well, how about a grilled cheese with truffle oil?

415
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
you do love truffles.

416
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,000
enough to know it's not on the menu.

417
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,300
good thing i'm connected.

418
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,500
whoa.

419
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
only 'cause i'm hungry.

420
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,300
wow.

421
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,050
hi.

422
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,680
hi.

423
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,690
is it too much?

424
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,950
i want it to be special.

425
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,960
what's wrong?

426
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,170
look,i don't know how to say this...

427
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,310
or if it's even the right thing to do,

428
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,040
but,um...

429
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,800
there's something i need to tell you.

430
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,110
alfonso,you're a stud.

431
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:01,010
now,uh,have a good night. we're closing the kitchen early.

432
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,030
oh,my god. this is so good.

433
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,860
well,if you're looking for a way to thank me,

434
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,390
i've got a couple ideas.

435
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,440
it's a sandwich,chuck.

436
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,630
(scoffs) this is... mnh-mnh.

437
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,260
this is not happening right now.

438
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,090
you worried nate'll find out?

439
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,400
what?

440
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,630
last year... the shepherd wedding.

441
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:35,050
you think i don't know why you left town?

442
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,810
<i>come on,hurry up.</i>

443
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,760
<i>you know we're not supposed to be in here. oh,if the happy couple didn't want</i>

444
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,930
<i>to put up the cash for the premium bar,</i>

445
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,030
<i>they should have made their wedding b.y.o.b.</i>

446
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,820
<i>no! let me see it.</i>

447
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,710
<i>no,make me. i can do it. i can do it.</i>

448
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,560
<i>no,you can't. let me just show you. here,come here. let me see it.</i>

449
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,410
<i>i can do it. stop. let me see it.</i>

450
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,570
<i>ooh! oh,no.</i>

451
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,260
<i>(laughs) nate! that never happens to me.</i>

452
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,200
<i>it's okay. you're still a man in my eyes.</i>

453
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,210
<i>come here.</i>

454
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,160
<i>look at you. you're a mess.</i>

455
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,630
<i>so are you.</i>

456
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,790
but... that was it.

457
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,600
you guys kissed.

458
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,800
best friend and the boyfriend.

459
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,890
that's pretty classy,s.

460
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:54,100
i think you're more like me than you'd admit.

461
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,090
no.

462
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:00,550
no,that--that was then. i... i'm trying to change.

463
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,350
i liked you better before.

464
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,240
chuck,stop it. stop.

465
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:11,510
no! chuck,stop it!

466
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:16,790
i knew it! i always knew there was something! get out!

467
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,190
chuck! no!

468
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,280
get off of me!

469
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,650
oh! oh!

470
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,400
(crash) i'm so sorry.

471
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,150
are--are you okay?

472
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,340
<i>(gossip girl) and just when b. and s. had built a bridge,</i>

473
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,640
<i>it all had to come crashing down.</i>

474
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,250
<i>but dry your eyes.</i>

475
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,470
<i>the kiss on the lips party is around the corner.</i>

476
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,630
<i>and you know who loves parties? gossip girl.</i>

477
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,510
nice try,son.

478
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,410
(chuckles) maybe next time.

479
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,130
you seem upbeat this morning.

480
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,180
did you have fun with blair last night?

481
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,910
actually,we got into a pretty big fight. oh,you want my advice?

482
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,740
apologize, even if it was her fault.

483
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,560
flowers,maybe some jewelry if she's really upset.

484
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,900
always works for your mom. i don't know. i think it might be for the best.

485
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,440
wait a minute. you guys broke up?

486
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,850
yeah,i guess we did.

487
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,640
blair is a great girl.

488
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,960
i know. i'm just not sure if she's the girl for me.

489
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:50,000
and you guys have been dating since kindergarten. so i keep hearing.

490
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,790
well,you love her, don't you? yes,i do.

491
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,270
i just think

492
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,390
it might be good for us to take a break,you know?

493
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,160
maybe not right now.

494
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,520
eleanor waldorf is gearing up to take her company public,

495
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,750
and i've been courting her for months

496
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,630
to let me handle the deal. then you should get it.

497
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:11,200
<i>i will get it. if you could just help me out a little bit...</i>

498
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,810
what? you love her. she loves you.

499
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,620
it's just a rough patch, that's all.

500
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,140
you don't give up just because things are hard,

501
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,180
not in business,or if your family is depending on you.

502
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,320
how do you know it was miss van der woodsen's

503
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,220
if you didn't read it?

504
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,430
and if you're not a guest at the hotel,

505
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,260
what were you doing here? what?

506
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,320
uh,look,when prince charming found cinderella's slipper,

507
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,110
they didn't accuse him of having a foot fetish.

508
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:42,080
uh,and you're prince charming? well...

509
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,570
well,there's miss van der woodsen now. no,no!

510
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,960
uh,serena? no,no,no,no,no.

511
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,790
what are you doing? don't. hey,um,do you know this young man?

512
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,020
<i>she doesn't know me. nobody knows me.</i>

513
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,430
it's cool. it's fine.

514
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,180
uh... from last night.

515
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,030
are you...

516
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,770
um,i'm sorry about that.

517
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,280
you remember me?

518
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,650
she remembers me.

519
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,160
well,he claims he found your cell phone.

520
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,580
oh! you found it.

521
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,360

524
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,470

00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,170

00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,890
lincoln hawk? yeah, "rolling stone" named them

537
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,200
one of the top ten forgotten bands of the '90s.

538
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,290
whoo! i'm a huge fan.

539
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,120
mm. well,this party would've been the perfect opportunity

540
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,810
for you to announce your return,

541
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,480
but i guess i'll just,uh, keep the dress for myself.

542
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,320
thank you.

543
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,490
yeah,no,uh... it's not a problem,really.

544
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,770
so you'll pick me up at 8:00?

545
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,090
you'd really go out with some guy you don't know?

546
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,990
<i>well,you can't be worse than the guys i do know.</i>

547
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,420
thanks for meeting me.

548
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,780
look,blair, i-i really hurt you,

549
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,780
and i know that, and i wanna fix it.

550
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:55,350
really? and how are you gonna do that? i'm gonna put everything in the past.

551
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,360
i'm not gonna see serena again or even talk to her.

552
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,140
it'll be like she doesn't exist.

553
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:06,110
* splashing around in the muck and the mire *

554
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,820
i think that's a good idea. let's not mention it again.

555
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,020
you gonna eat that?

556
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,040
that's it?

557
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,800
'cause you were pretty upset last night.

558
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,880
i mean, should we talk about this? there's nothing to talk about.

559
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,180
i overreacted.

560
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,330
if you say it's in the past, it's in the past.

561
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,360
i'm sure you have no feelings for her anymore.

562
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,520
* now hang me up to dry

563
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,960
ee i d st fl bafor serena. she'll really miss you.

564
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,070
what time does the limo come? 8:00.

565
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:38,530
perfect.

566
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,760
* now hang me up to dry

567
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,540
(chuckles) lily.

568
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,070
are you shopping for some art to match your furniture?

569
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,200
why is my daughter going to one of your concerts?

570
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,060
'cause we're awesome.

571
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,540
with your son.

572
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,040
dan scored a date with serena?

573
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,580
mm-hmm. well,our kids were bound to meet.

574
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,260
it's a small island. are you sure it's not some ploy, your using my daughter

575
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,510
to get to me now that your wife left you? how do you know about alison?

576
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,810
like you said-- small island.

577
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,040
oh,i get it.

578
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,120
you hear about alison,

579
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,430
use your daughter as an excuse to start something.

580
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,930
yeah. (laughs) in your dreams.

581
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,040
<i>well,you are in my dreams, lily,</i>

582
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,960
and one in particular recurs-- it involves finding you

583
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,590
in the back of a nine inch nails bus

584
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,270
with your shoes in your earrings and trent reznor--

585
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,570
oh. (chuckles) that happened.

586
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:38,530
(chuckles) no need to rehash details of decades past.

587
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,530
so i moved on--

588
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,600
yeah,from trent to layne to perry,

589
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,610
till you switched up rock stars for billionaires.

590
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,440
you think you're so cute...

591
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,940
washed-up band, crappy so-called art gallery.

592
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,010
well,not all of us have settlements

593
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,260
from multiple divorces to sustain us.

594
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,960
just stay out of my life, rufus.

595
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,360
* ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba,ba ba ba *

596
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,100
* ba,ba ba ba ba

597
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,780
you're going out with serena,

598
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,790
and i'm going to kiss on the lips.

599
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,130
who said this family wasn't cool? mm-hmm.

600
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,820
well,listen,i don't want to be late,but good luck,all right?

601
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,040
(jenny) same.

602
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,270
see you at the concert, right,dad?

603
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,660
uh... okay.

604
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,170
oh,my god.

605
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,720
my daughter's a woman.

606
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,410
dad,you could just tell me i look nice

607
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,020
instead of turning this

608
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,390
into a sermon on the passage of time.

609
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,510
you look like...

610
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,930
your mother.

611
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,270
thanks.

612
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,030
mmm.

613
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,370
blair,let me see how it looks.

614
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,490
why are you wearing that one?

615
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,380
didn't you see the dress i left on the bed?

616
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,470
i like this one.

617
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:59,240
<i>this one is not as elegant a choice as that one.</i>

618
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,310
why do you care so much?

619
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,080
because i love you.

620
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,680
blair,you will never be more beautiful or thin or happy

621
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,900
than you are right now.

622
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,170
i just want you to make the most of it.

623
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,930
i guess i have time to change.

624
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,000
