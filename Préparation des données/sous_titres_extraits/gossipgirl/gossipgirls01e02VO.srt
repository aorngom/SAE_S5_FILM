someone saw serena getting off

9
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:23,124
-everyone knows serena

19
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:45,725
must be a lot of rumors
why you're back.

20
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:48,525
yeah, but none of them
mention you.

21
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:50,525
he tries to take his own life,
and you're worried

22

<i>it's gonna cost you, mom?
you have no idea

uh, serena, um,
do you know this young man?

31
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:17,555
oh, from last night.
you remember me?

32
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:20,025
you'd really go out
with some guy you don't know?

33
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:22,025
<i>well, he can't be worse
than the guys i do know.</i>

34
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:24,025
guess whose dad is cool.
it's a trick question.

35
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:25,525
(dan) yeah,
'cause it can't be ours.

36
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:29,025
"top ten forgotten bands

38
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,425
(lily) why is my daughter
going to one of your concerts?

39
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:38,125
well, our kids were bound
to meet. it's a small island.
are you sure it's not some ploy,

40
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,224
-using my daughter to get to me

41
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,249
now that your wife left you?

42
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:43,724
<i>serena and her mystery man

45
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:50,425

she wasn't invited.

46
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:53,662
<i>but serena wasn't the only one
who made an impression...
who's the newbie?</i>

48
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,525

somewhere quieter.

49
00:01:58,525 --> 00:01:59,825
get off! stop!

50
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:02,597

<i>don't you
ever touch her again!</i>

52

hey, your life is over, slut!

53
00:02:07,925 --> 00:02:09,774
she better
not show her face again.

54
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:11,867
i'm actually hoping
she will.

55
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:15,351

at a second date?
we'll talk about it

and you're
checking up on me.

87
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:41,938
i'm okay.
really, i'm okay.

88
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,997
you know, i was okay
when you asked me at the party

89
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:46,111
and in the cab,
when we got home,

90
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:48,194
<i>before and after
i brushed my teeth.</i>

91

look, i just feel
really stupid.

92

i mean, how could
i have actually thought

93
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:56,469
that chuck bass
just wanted to talk to me?

94
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:00,111
because you trust people,

95
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:01,311
which is normally
a good thing.

96
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:04,410
yeah, except
when it involves chuck.
yeah, pretty much.

97
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,279
so the real question is,
uh, how are you?

98
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:08,813
me?

99
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:11,953
why wouldn't i be okay?

100
00:04:11,954 --> 00:04:13,454
you know, at the end
of the night, with serena

101
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,176
and the--the--the...

102
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:18,422
was it really that bad?

103
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:23,984
<i>this is me.</i>

104
00:04:27,754 --> 00:04:29,753
<i>so... good night.</i>

105
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:30,854
<i>yeah. (chuckles)</i>

106
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,545
<i>yeah.
um, yeah, good night.</i>

107
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:41,858
<i>(scoffs) go! walk her
to the door. something. go!
okay.</i>

108
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:44,896
<i>oh! oh, god.
that hurt a lot.
whoa, whoa, stop, stop.</i>

109
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:48,154
<i>oh, i think
i have brain damage.
you know what, dan?</i>

110
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:51,556
<i>you wouldn't even know
if you had brain damage.
no, let's go, please.</i>

111
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:53,253
<i>(jenny) no!</i>

112
00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:55,253
<i>h-hi.</i>

113
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,393
so he waved?

114
00:05:06,354 --> 00:05:07,554
£¿

115
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:09,054
no, he was just trying
to be funny.

116
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:11,554
maybe he's shy.
or he hates me.

117
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:14,354
no guy in the history
of the world has ever hated you.

118
00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:15,802
she probably thinks
i hate her now.

119
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:18,844
i've waited my entire adolescent
life for a date with this girl,

120
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:20,390
you know,
serena van ddsen...

121
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,753
and i decide to close
the evening with a wave.
it was a nice wave.

122
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:25,854
at the end of a date?
come on, there's no such thing.

123
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:28,354
and you only get one shot
with a girl like serena.

124
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:31,354
i got mine, and i blew it.
which means
you have nothing to lose.

125
00:05:31,354 --> 00:05:35,369
(sighs) no, nothing except
my last shred of dignity.
oh, no. i think that's gone.

126
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:39,565
you're right.

127
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:42,848
you know what? i'm just--
i'm gonna go talk to her.

128
00:05:43,054 --> 00:05:45,199
i'm gonna apologize
for the wave.

129
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:47,412
i'm gonna tell her
how much i like her,

130
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:49,288
and i'm gonna ask
for a second shot.

131
00:05:49,354 --> 00:05:51,554
<i>no, i'm gonna get
a second shot.
yeah, you are.</i>

132
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:53,556
yeah.
wait, wait, wait.

133
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,053
i love the plan,

134
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,934
but, uh, you need
a better outfit.

135
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:00,075
and maybe a shower.

136
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:06,054
whatever.
it's probably for the best.

137
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:09,256
the last thing i need
in my life is a new guy.

138
00:06:09,654 --> 00:06:11,754
he was just so smart,
th

139
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:13,172
and--and funny...

140
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:15,270
it sounds like
you like him.

141
00:06:16,154 --> 00:06:17,212
and really nice.

142
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:22,150
<i>god, blair was
so mean to me last night.</i>

143
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:23,454
i don't even know why.
whatever.

144
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:25,821
i'm sure if we talk about it,
we can work it out.

145
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,054
hey, maybe i should
go over there.

146
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:31,512
(blair) serena had better
just stay away.

147
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:33,854
thank you, dorota.
(isabel) yeah, thanks.

148
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:36,354
we love sleeping at blair's.
i don't want
to see serena at school,

149
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,954
and she better not show
at brunch today.
you're really mad at serena.

150
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:42,954
yeah, i hope you never
get that mad at us.
well, you would never do

151
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:44,785
no, never.
of course not.

152
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,998
i wonder if nate
remembered brunch.

153
00:06:47,154 --> 00:06:48,654
it would be so wrong
for me to show up

154
00:06:48,654 --> 00:06:53,654
without my boyfriend
whom i love, and who loves me.
(cell phone beeps)

155
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,015
mm.

156
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:05,795
hello?

157
00:07:06,154 --> 00:07:08,161
hi, sweetie.
did i wake you?

158
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:10,154
no, i'm up.

159
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:11,754
well,
get some strong coffee

160
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:13,454
and jump in the shower,
sleepyhead.

161
00:07:13,454 --> 00:07:14,954
chuck's dad's brunch
for his foundation

162
00:07:14,954 --> 00:07:17,761
is today at the palace.
oh, right. of course.

163
00:07:24,254 --> 00:07:26,156
nathaniel, keep it down.

164
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:29,371
some of us are trying
to regain our strength.

165
00:07:29,454 --> 00:07:30,854
your dad's brunch is today.

166
00:07:30,854 --> 00:07:32,754
alarm's set for 9:00.

167
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:33,638
it's 10:00.

168
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:41,396
ladies, double-time.

169
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:45,225
hmm?

170
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:47,849
oh, unless... nathaniel...

171
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:49,883
i'm good.

172
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:53,054
actually, could you two
bring some coffee

173
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:56,537
when you get a chance?
and some water... lots of water.

174
00:07:56,954 --> 00:07:58,163
you want ice with that?

175
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:01,371
<i>looks like
you could use some.</i>

176
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:03,243
that's enough, ladies.

177
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:05,254
and i'll be sure
to tell my father

178
00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:09,728
just how committed you are
to the hospitality industry.

179
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:15,907
that kid popped
you pretty good, huh?

180
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:19,904
never mess
with a guy's sister.
and if i knew his name,

181
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:21,254
why, 'cause you
kill people now?

182
00:08:21,254 --> 00:08:22,874
you gonna strangle him
with your scarf?

183
00:08:24,154 --> 00:08:26,554
don't mock the scarf, nathaniel.
it's my signature.

184
00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:27,354
i'm just saying,

185
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:29,954
death by scarf--
not that intimidating.

186
00:08:29,954 --> 00:08:32,135
he sucker punched me.
i told you.

187
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:35,954
besides,
better a broken nose

188
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:38,054
than a broken heart.

189
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:40,409
what? i didn't even talk
to serena last night.

190
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,647
who said anything
about serena?

191
00:08:56,254 --> 00:08:57,154
do i look okay?

192
00:08:57,154 --> 00:08:59,053
definitely
second-shot material.

193
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:00,712
all right,
then i'm gonna go.

194
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:02,897
oh, um,

195
00:09:03,654 --> 00:09:05,954
and about what happened,
you know, with, uh, chuck?

196
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:08,554
if you wanna,
like, talk to someone...

197
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:11,227
n-not your brother--
just let me know.

198
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:13,646
okay.

199
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,154
yeah, i'll...

200
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,548
all right.

201
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:20,054
hey, uh, wait.

202
00:09:20,054 --> 00:09:21,675
actually, there is someone
i wanna talk to.

203
00:09:24,754 --> 00:09:26,454
hey, hey,
where you guys going?

204
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:28,354
i was gonna make waffles.
ooh. sorry, dad.

205
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:30,286
yeah, can't.
but i wanna hear
about your date.

206
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:31,854
(dan) later.
and your party.

207
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:34,474
when we get back.
you guys missed
a really great show,

208
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:37,105
and i make
really good waffles.

209
00:09:38,054 --> 00:09:39,754
(rihanna) * my engine's ready
to explode, explode, explode *

210
00:09:39,754 --> 00:09:42,554
(man) palace hotel lobby.
hi. this is,
uh, nate archibald

211
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:45,254
calling from the bass suite.
i know you don't normally

212
00:09:45,254 --> 00:09:47,654

but can you tell me what room

213
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,154
the van der woodsens
are in, please?

214
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,454
hey, blair. it's me.

215
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:51,954
uh, i guess
you're still sleeping,

216
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:53,254
but i'm gonna come over.

217
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:54,617
i think we need to talk.

218
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:58,968
okay. uh, see you soon. bye.

219
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:03,054
* so if you feel me,
let me know, know, know *

220
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:04,354
* come on now

221
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,454
<i>it looks like
the table's all set.</i>

222
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:09,485
<i>as soon as the guests arrive,
we can start dishing.</i>

223
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:11,154
<i>here's what's on the menu...</i>

224
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:13,154
* watch me go, go, go, go

225
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,254
* get you where you wanna go,
if you know what i mean *

226
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:20,056
<i>* baby, you got the keys
(tires screech, loud crash)</i>

227
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,100
?  my michel perrys?

228
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:26,354
(groans)
i can't find anything in here!

229
00:10:26,354 --> 00:10:28,454
well, it might help
if you unpacked.

230
00:10:28,454 --> 00:10:29,154
look, you're home now.

231
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:30,854
it's your life.
you should start living it.

232
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:33,054
this is not life,
this is a hotel--

233
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:35,254
which we're living in because
you decided you didn't like

234
00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:37,617
the color of the walls
in our real home.

235
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:41,054
mom, i said
i'd go to this brunch.

236
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:43,354
what more do you want from me?
sweetie, why are you
being like this?

237
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:46,799
<i>you love parties.
this is just not like you.</i>

238
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:49,954
maybe it is like me. maybe you
don't know what i'm really like.

239
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:51,347
oh, okay, tell me.

240
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,460
so did you and dan have fun
at the concert last night?

241
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:01,809
we, um, never made it.

242
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:04,054
we actually ended up
at the kiss on the lips party.

243
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:06,619
ah. well,
that must have pleased blair.

244
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:09,054
blair? actually,
no, not that pleased,

245
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:11,154
which is why i'm going
to talk to her.

246
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:13,254
well just be back
in time for brunch, okay?
mom.

247
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:16,254
look, honey, i know how hard
it is for you to be back,

248
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:17,654
but the more
you hide yourself away,

249
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:19,754
the more people are gonna think
you have something to hide.
coming from someone

250
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:22,646
who's keeping my brother
in an institution.

251
00:11:22,654 --> 00:11:26,090
that's different.
i mean it. don't be late.

252
00:11:42,854 --> 00:11:44,854
hey. how you doing?

253
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:48,054
uh, i-i was in yesterday
with serena.
how could i forget?

254
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:52,264
yeah, well, um,
is she in?

255
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,954
just missed her, actually,
but you're welcome to wait.

256
00:11:54,954 --> 00:11:56,854
okay, maybe i will.

257
00:11:56,854 --> 00:11:58,903
she--she probably
won't be that long, right?

258
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:00,854
once she went out and didn't
come back for six months,

259
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,277
but feel free to sit.

260
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:07,812
over there.

261
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:10,433
over there
is where i'll be.

262
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,300
hi, nate.
it's great to see you.

263
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,000
hi, mrs. van der woodsen.

oh, i'm just heading out.

264
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,400
oh, is serena in?
oh, you just missed her,
but i'll tell her you came by.

265
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,500
i'm sure she'll
be happy to hear it.
uh, i don't know aut that.

266
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,400
oh, what?
come on, serena loves you.

267
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
i mean, i think she's always
had a little crush on you.

268
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
<i>of course, you and blair
are the perfect couple.</i>

269
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,300
mm. is serena gonna be long?
i could just wait.oh, well,
dexter here can take care of you.

270
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,600
i'm just gonna step out
for a while.

271
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
nate's gonna wait
for serena.

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,300
great. he can get in line
behind that guy.

273
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,400
i had a feeling
you'd be back.

274
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,800
dan, is it?

275
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,400
humphrey. yes.

276
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,900
it's nice to see you again,
mrs. van der woodsen.

277
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,600
i hope you've had
a pleasant, uh...

278
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,100
uh, 21 hours
since i last saw you.

279
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,800
yes, it has
been very pleasant...

280
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,000
until now.

281
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,700
gentlemen.

282
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,100
hey.

283
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,600
hey.

284
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,000
blair?

285
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
hey.

286
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,700
serena.

287
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,300
hey, i got two bone-dry caps
and audrey.

288
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,300
(laughs) i must
have totally blanked

289
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,000
on the part
where i invited you over.

290
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,600
i-i called you.

291
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,200
blair, it's sunday morning.

292
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,000
coffee, croissants,
"breakfast at tiffany's."

293
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,600
it's our tradition.

294
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,800
i have new traditions now.

295
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,300
well, they're not traditions
if they're new.

296
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,700
look, blair, i'm really trying
to make an effort here.

297
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,200
i thought everything
was good between us.

298
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,000
it was...

299
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,600
before i found out
you had sex with my boyfriend.

300
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,300
how'd you find out?

301
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,500
nate told me.

302
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,600
<i>at least he felt he owed it
to me to tell the truth.
i don't know what to say.</i>

303
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,900
don't bother saying anything.
i wouldn't believe you anyway.

304
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
blair, it was...

305
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,700
you know...

306
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,400
i always knew
you were a whore.

307
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,700
i never took you
for a liar, too.

308
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,400
blair, how can i fix this?

309
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,900
you don't, serena.

310
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,700
you just stay away
from me,

311
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,100
my boyfriend
and my friends.

312
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,300
you're done here.

313
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,500
<i>serena's visit was short
and apparently not very sweet.</i>

314
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,300
<i>but you know what is?</i>

315
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,500
<i>revenge.</i>

316
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,700
<i>we hear it's best served cold.</i>

317
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
<i>who's hungry?</i>

318
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,700
dorota, i told you
i didn't want to see anyone.

319
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,500
hi, jenny.

320
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,600
hi.

321
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,100
what do you want?

322
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,500
uh...

323
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,100
i realized that i still have
your calligraphy pens

324
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,400
from the party invitations,

325
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,200
and thought you might
need them for something.

326
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,100
that is the lamest excuse
i've ever heard.

327
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,900
you wanna know what chuck bass
is saying about you.

328
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,700
no.

329
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
is he... saying things?

330
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,500
is anyone?

331
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
mm... no.

332
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,600
not yet, anyway.

333
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,100
chuck likes to brag about
his conquests, not his victims.

334
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,000
come on. you can help me
get ready for brunch.

335
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,100
okay. sure.

336
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,100
nice flowers.

337
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,700
they're hydrangeas.

338
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,300
just coffee.
i'm not staying long.

339
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,600
i'd like to get out of here
before someone throws me down

340
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
and tattoos me.
this is brooklyn, lil,
not the warped tour.

341
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,100
and don't tell me you had
all your tattoos removed.

342
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,500
i mean, even that one,

343
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,200
that little heart-shaped one
between your, uh...
uh, don't try to be cute, okay?

344
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,400
those days are well behind you.
and here i thought i was getting
better-looking every day.

345
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,400
so what's the big emergency?
dan went out
with serena last night.

346
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,600
and us humphreys sure
are proud of him.well, currently,
he's sitting in the lobby

347
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,500
of the hotel
where we're living.
(woman) hi. can i help you?

348
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,800
two americanos...
one with an extra shot?
mm-hmm.

349
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,100
you don't actually think
i'm gonna tell my kid

350
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,100
who he can and can't date.

351
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,200
i mean, is that really
the reason you came down here?

352
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,800
oh, well, i know what you're implying.
admit it. you're falling for me again.

353
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,200
you're right, you're right.
it's the low-income tax bracket,

354
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
the bad v-neck t-shirts,
the awful jokes.

355
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,800
i don't know
why your wife lied  you.

356
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,700
well, she's got better
taste than you.
here you are. thanks.

357
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,100
i mean, come on.
why else have i seen you

358
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,500
more in the last 2 days
than in the last 15 years?
an unfortunate twist of fate.

359
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,900
but fate nonetheless.
unless you, uh...

360
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,500
are you seeing someone?

361
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,400
no, not really.

362
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,900
uh-huh, not serious...

363
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,700
or he's married.
that is your type.

364
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,900
that's enough, rufus.

365
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,400
what's his name?

366
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,000
i've read about him
in "forbes" or "rolling stone"?

367
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,900
well, whoever he is, i'm sure
he can't keep up with you.

368
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,000
well, i'm gonna take that
as a compliment,

369
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
but i'm serious.
i'm worried about serena.

370
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,200
i don't need some new boy
influencing her,

371
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,600
distracting her
from her needs.
well, no offense, lil,

372
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,400
but i'm guessing a kid like dan
is exactly what serena needs.

373
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,400
so, uh...

374
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,800
what do you need
to talk to serena about?

375
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,600
nothing,
just in the neighborhood.

376
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,900
you?

377
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,100
i...

378
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,900
am nowhere near
the neighborhood,

379
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,800
but i'm working
on a better excuse.

380
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,500
you guys, like...

381
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,300
oh, uh...

382
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,700
i... i don't know.

383
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,500
yeah, well,
that's serena.

384
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,300
with her,
you'll never know.

385
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,800
nathaniel.

386
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,700
there you are.
what are you doing?

387
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,900
nothing, waiting for you.

388
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,700
him?

389
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,400
hey, what are you doing here?
why, what is this--
uh, your hotel?

390
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,300
actually, it is.
yeah, so unless you have
a reason to be here,

391
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
i'll have to ask you
to wait on the curb

392
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,800
with the rest of the trash.
trash? look, man,
i live in brooklyn, all right?

393
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,400
not the ozarks...
no offense to the ozarks.

394
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,400
but don't you think we're
taking this class warfare thing

395
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,300
a little too far?
i haven't even started, man.

396
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,300
okay, man, let's just go.
don't tell me you're sticking up
for serena's new bitch.

397
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,400
if anyone's got a reason
to kick his ass, it's you.

398
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,900
he's not worth it.
not here.

399
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,400
this isn't over.

400
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,600
hey, anytime, man.

401
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,400
that one black eye
looks a little lonely.

402
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,600
(nate) come on, chill out.

403
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,900
wow. blair, it's...
it's beautiful.

404
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,000
i mean, you look...
beautiful.

405
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,000
it's average.

406
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,400
the color is last season,

407
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,900
and besides,
stella mccartney has

408
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,300
a much better version
at bergdorf's.

409
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,700
right. i... i've been meaning
to go by bergdorf's.

410
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,700
wow,
these dolls are great.

411
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,000
oh, my god.
you have a cabbage patch.

412
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,300
my brother used to have one
of these. his name was cedric.

413
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,700
your brother's name is cedric?
uh, no that was
his cabbage patch kid.

414
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,800
my brother's name is dan.
actually, you might know him.

415
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,100
he, um, he went out
with serena last night.

416
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,400
that's your brother?

417
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,200
so does that mean
you're friends with serena now?

418
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,700
i mean, i don't have
a problem with her,

419
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
but if someone did have
a problem with her,

420
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,800
i wouldn't have a problem
with that either.

421
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300
you know...

422
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,900
if you like that dress,
you can have it.

423
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,400
what? no, no.

424
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,600
i'm sure you'll
find some way to repay me.

425
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,200
oh, blair, thank you.

426
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,900
i mean,
for the dress and...

427
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,300
for the other thing
about, uh, about chuck.

428
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,000
if you want to be
part of this world, jenny,

429
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
<i>people will talk...</i>

430
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,500
eventually,

431
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,200
and you need to decide
if all this is worth it.

432
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,500
dan. (laughs) hey.

433
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,500
i-i-i was
in the neighborhood...

434
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,900
uh, give or take 70 blocks.

435
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,500
um, i just wanted
to tell you in person

436
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,300
that, uh,
the end of last night

437
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,600
may have not been
my finest hour.

438
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,500
there was a, uh, a wave.

439
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,800
i-i-i saw that, yeah.

440
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,800
yeah, yeah, and since then,

441
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,300
i've just
been wondering, uh...

442
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,000
are you hungry?

443
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,500
yes.

444
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,200
actually, i've had
g.worsmornin

445
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,100
well, you--you wanna--
you wanna talk?

446
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,100
and eat? not necessarily
in that order.
yes, i would love to do both,

447
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,200
but food first,because i'm starving.
great.just in time for brunch.

448
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,400
mom.

449
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,500
ms. van der woodsen.

450
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,700
dan... still here.

451
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,300
look, mom,
i really don't think

452
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,800
it's a good idea
for me to go to that brunch.
you promised.

453
00:22:57,915 --> 00:22:59,600
yeah, but that was bef--

454
00:23:00,104 --> 00:23:02,503
before i knew dan
was hungry, too.

455
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:04,046
i can't let the boy starve.

456
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:07,904
it would be inhumane.

457
00:23:07,904 --> 00:23:10,089
he's not invited.
yeah, that's why
i'm going with him.

458
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:13,009
because i can't go
with her.

459
00:23:13,704 --> 00:23:17,240
and we have plans
to go to brunch togeth today

460
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:19,504
we had those plans.

461
00:23:19,504 --> 00:23:21,504
serena, you're home,

462
00:23:21,504 --> 00:23:23,626
living under my roof,
my rules.

463
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:26,504
what is it gonna take
to get you dressed

464
00:23:26,504 --> 00:23:27,551
and through that door?

465
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:54,930
uh, you know what? may--
maybe this was a-a bad idea.

466
00:23:55,304 --> 00:23:57,633
(laughs)
you've got to be kidding.

467
00:23:57,704 --> 00:24:01,376
yeah, this was--this was
definitely a bad idea.
this should be fun.

468
00:24:01,404 --> 00:24:02,504
<i>looks like chuck and blair</i>

469
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:04,933
<i>showed up
with quite an appetite...</i>

470
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:07,094
<i>for destruction, that is.</i>

471
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:24,304
hey, dad,
how's the new song going?

472
00:24:24,304 --> 00:24:25,783
oh, i think
i need more coffee.

473
00:24:26,504 --> 00:24:27,371
whatever works.

474
00:24:29,104 --> 00:24:32,204
where'd you get the dress?
oh, it was a thank you-gift
from blair

475
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,704
for doing
the party invitations.
oh, and it looks like a very expensive thanks gift

476
00:24:35,704 --> 00:24:37,504
dad, she has a closet
the size of this apartment

477
00:24:37,504 --> 00:24:40,104
just full of them.
see, her mom designed it.
and her mom

478
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:45,156
but the dress you made
for yourself is much nicer.
which is why ?

479
00:24:45,204 --> 00:24:47,004
uh, one of a couple
of reasons.

480
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:48,522
hey, you think
the farmers market's still open?

481
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:51,804
yeah. why, you wanna go?
yeah.

482
00:24:52,204 --> 00:24:55,199
i thought you were getting too
old to go places with your dad.
well, you used to be cool,

483
00:24:55,504 --> 00:24:57,404
and the '90s
are having a comeback.

484
00:24:57,904 --> 00:24:59,860
you have no idea
how much that hurts.

485
00:25:03,204 --> 00:25:05,904
well, i can't say much
for his child-rearing skills,

486
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,709
but bart bass
knows brunch.

487
00:25:09,904 --> 00:25:13,004
* well, who the hell am i to
tell her how to live her life? *

488
00:25:13,004 --> 00:25:15,604
* and if you could put dumb
in a shot glass *

489
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:18,604
* i'm just another lush
who's had one too many in me *

490
00:25:19,304 --> 00:25:22,981
um, i, uh, i-i need to use
the ladies room.

491
00:25:23,204 --> 00:25:25,511
uh, you think you'll be okay
by yourself for a while?

492
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:28,204
yeah. come on.
me and, uh, some beluga caviar?

493
00:25:29,004 --> 00:25:30,604
can't get enough
of the stuff.

494
00:25:30,604 --> 00:25:31,604
okay.

495
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:32,027
great.

496
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:35,304
hey, how's it going?

497
00:25:35,304 --> 00:25:37,404
* and she's made me fiend

498
00:25:37,404 --> 00:25:38,304
no, you're--you're okay.

499
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,048
yeah, just, uh, go ahead
and do your thing.

500
00:25:41,304 --> 00:25:42,704
* oh, no

506
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,904
father.

507
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:57,904
the, uh,
the invitation said

508
00:25:57,904 --> 00:25:59,700
"black tie,"
not "black eye."

509
00:26:00,704 --> 00:26:01,475
are you okay?

510
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:05,060
i mean, if you're
in some kind of trouble...

511
00:26:06,604 --> 00:26:07,912
only of my own making.

512
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,904
why do you think
i do all this, huh?

513
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:16,004
this party is for you,
okay?

514
00:26:16,204 --> 00:26:17,704

517
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:22,126
really?

518
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:24,904
i thought it was
another excuse for an open bar

519
00:26:24,904 --> 00:26:27,911
and, uh, rehiring
of the nearly nude statues.

520
00:26:28,904 --> 00:26:30,704

which means you can listen.

527
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:48,804

00:26:48,904 --> 00:26:50,804

oh, nothing too dramatic,
i hope.

540
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,404
her line is doing very well.

541
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:23,904
i was just telling my firm what
a great investment she'd make.

542
00:27:24,104 --> 00:27:26,004
she's really going places.

543
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:28,556
hopefully places
far, far away. (laughs)

544
00:27:29,904 --> 00:27:30,717
just kidding.

545
00:27:31,204 --> 00:27:33,782

00:27:36,804 --> 00:27:37,670
* oh, no

548
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:40,604
blair seems happy.
it looks like, uh,

549
00:27:40,704 --> 00:27:42,904
you're taking care
of business, as discussed.

550
00:27:42,904 --> 00:27:45,104
dad, not everything in life's
a business deal.

551
00:27:45,904 --> 00:27:47,504

554
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:56,104
* she's only one more swallow
* hey

555
00:27:56,104 --> 00:27:59,736
* from being oh, so hollow
* hey, hey

556
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:01,620
i can't believe serena
came to this brunch.

557
00:28:03,004 --> 00:28:05,304
i told her to stay away.

558
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:09,104
you worried about nate?

559
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,704
* and bow out gracefully

560
00:28:10,704 --> 00:28:12,904
just a shot in the dark.

561
00:28:13,004 --> 00:28:15,205
i think you know what you need
to do to get his attention.

562
00:28:16,504 --> 00:28:19,104
and what's that?
the key to my suite,

563
00:28:19,104 --> 00:28:21,304
nate's heart
and your future happiness.

564
00:28:23,604 --> 00:28:26,104
* and bow out gracefully

565
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,904
i'm honored to be playing
even a small role

566
00:28:27,904 --> 00:28:29,004
in your deflowering.

567
00:28:29,004 --> 00:28:31,770
you're disgusting.
yes, i am, so why be shy?

568
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:34,604
just grab nate
and finish this.

569
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:36,304

570
00:28:36,504 --> 00:28:38,104

(chuckles) what, you have

577
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,504

578
00:28:53,504 --> 00:28:54,504

00:29:03,304 --> 00:29:04,904
mmm.

582
00:29:04,904 --> 00:29:06,683
i got us the best room
in the whole place.

583
00:29:11,104 --> 00:29:12,904
wait,
this is chuck's suite.
nate.

584
00:29:14,104 --> 00:29:14,834
serena?

585
00:29:16,204 --> 00:29:16,986
blair.

586
00:29:17,604 --> 00:29:19,204
<i>spotted--n. and b.</i>

587
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:22,043
<i>hot and heavy in the halls
of the palace hotel,</i>

588
00:29:22,204 --> 00:29:24,604
<i>only to find s.
already waiting.</i>

589
00:29:24,604 --> 00:29:26,604
<i>sparks were flying for sure,</i>

590
00:29:26,704 --> 00:29:28,704
<i>but will it be a 3-way</i>

591
00:29:29,604 --> 00:29:30,661
<i>or d-day?</i>

592
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:35,304
what is she doing here?
i was meeting nate.

593
00:29:35,704 --> 00:29:37,104
just to talk, i swear.
you said you'd never
speak to her again.

594
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:41,903
you said that?
why would you say that?
because you can't be trusted.

595
00:29:41,904 --> 00:29:43,804
it's not serena's fault.
do not defend her.

596
00:29:43,804 --> 00:29:46,504
<i>i asked her to come.
oh. oh, so you do want
to talk to her.</i>

597
00:29:46,504 --> 00:29:49,104
yes, to explain
why i'm not talking to her.

598
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:52,404
maybe i'll leave you two

599
00:29:52,404 --> 00:29:53,904
to finish that fascinating
conversation.

600
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:56,904
oh, no, no. i'll go. let you
guys get back to your quickie.

601
00:29:56,904 --> 00:29:58,304
it wasn't a quickie.

602
00:29:58,304 --> 00:30:01,104
sex is actually kind of
a big deal to some of us.

603
00:30:01,104 --> 00:30:04,671
oh, yeah, i can see that.
chuck's bed? very romantic.

604
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:06,473
classy, too.

605
00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:08,604
oh, like you?

606
00:30:08,904 --> 00:30:10,904
i'll bet your new friend dan

607
00:30:10,904 --> 00:30:13,304
<i>would love to hear
all about how classy you are.</i>

608
00:30:13,304 --> 00:30:15,004
dan? what...

609
00:30:15,804 --> 00:30:17,830
what, you really think
she would tell him?
it's blair.

610
00:30:18,704 --> 00:30:21,704
i can't believe you told her.
you just expected me
to keep it a secret?

611
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,904
yes, nate. there's nothing wrong
with keeping a secret

612
00:30:25,204 --> 00:30:27,504
if the truth
is gonna hurt someone.
that's a hell of a way

613
00:30:27,504 --> 00:30:29,504
oh, i'm sorry. i didn't
realize all of a sudden

614
00:30:30,004 --> 00:30:32,004
you're the most honest guy
on the planet.

615
00:30:35,604 --> 00:30:36,904
well, it just seems to me
that you're the one

616
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:38,404
<i>that doesn't want to be seen
together in public.
no, i do want</i>

617
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:42,087
i just don't want to see you
with anyone else.

618
00:30:42,504 --> 00:30:44,904
tell your harem
of shopgirls and models

619
00:30:44,904 --> 00:30:48,604
that you're seeing someone.
i am, but those conversations
take a little time.

620
00:30:48,604 --> 00:30:51,105
well, they've got nothing
but time, bart. they're 25.

621
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:55,122
excuse me.

622
00:30:59,504 --> 00:31:00,545
dan, wait

623
00:31:00,804 --> 00:31:03,704
look, i really don't appreciate
your lurking in the shadows,

624
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:05,704
eavesdropping
on my private conversation.

625
00:31:06,004 --> 00:31:08,404
what? no. no, no, i wasn't.
i was looking for serena.

626
00:31:08,404 --> 00:31:12,305
well, i don't see her.
do you?
no, which is why ?

627
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,504
i don't know
what you're doing here

628
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:17,404
or what you think
you heard...
nothing. i heard nothing.

629
00:31:17,404 --> 00:31:19,804
but serena doesn't know.

630
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:23,604
and neither do i, okay?

631
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:25,904
so now if you'll excuse me,
i'm gonna go back inside,

632
00:31:25,904 --> 00:31:28,404
not tell anyone a thing
and mind my own business.

633
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:33,504
* so if you feel me,
let me know,w, kw *

634
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:37,104
* come on now, what you
waiting for, for, for? *

635
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:41,004
* my engine's ready
to explode, explode, explode *

636
00:31:41,004 --> 00:31:43,712
* so start me up
and watch me go, go, go *

637
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:44,861
dan.

638
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:48,404
hi. i'm blair waldorf,
serena's friend.

639
00:31:48,404 --> 00:31:50,778
oh, hey. yeah, uh, do you
happen to know where she is?

640
00:31:51,104 --> 00:31:53,304
as a matter of fact, i do.
(serena) blair.

641
00:31:53,904 --> 00:31:56,769
serena, there you are.
uh, where were you?
she was waiting in a hotel room

642
00:31:57,604 --> 00:31:59,904
to talk.
about why
we weren't talking.

643
00:31:59,904 --> 00:32:02,704
that doesn't sound
any smarter the second time.
why weren't you talking?

644
00:32:04,804 --> 00:32:05,904
does this have
anything to do with

645
00:32:05,904 --> 00:32:07,604
why you were waiting
for serena this morning?
(blair) you were what?

646
00:32:07,604 --> 00:32:11,906
(chuck) and here i thought
you were waiting for me.
oh, exactly what ?

647
00:32:13,504 --> 00:32:15,704
now what is going on here?
we were just getting into that.

648
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:20,798
blair, please, don't do this.
sorry. oh,
do you wanna tell him?

649
00:32:21,604 --> 00:32:23,604
i'll tell him.
(nate and blair) you know?

650
00:32:23,604 --> 00:32:25,668
i know everything.
and apparently,
i know nothing.

651
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:30,804
look, dan, it--it was a long
time ago, and i regret it.
(chuck) look, serena,

652
00:32:30,804 --> 00:32:32,904
stop trying to pretend
you're a good girl.

653
00:32:33,504 --> 00:32:35,404
so you slept with
your best friend's boyfriend.

654
00:32:35,404 --> 00:32:37,047
i kind of admire you
for it.

655
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:42,197
is that true?

656
00:32:45,704 --> 00:32:49,338
well, then she ran away
and lied about it.

657
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,504
i just thought you should know
before you fall head over heels

658
00:32:56,504 --> 00:32:58,804
for your perfect girl
and her perfect world,

659
00:32:59,204 --> 00:33:00,304
and then get left all alone

660
00:33:00,304 --> 00:33:03,023
with no one
but your cabbage patch kid.
cabbage patch?

661
00:33:03,406 --> 00:33:05,887
did you talk to my sister?
ah, yes, little jenny.

662
00:33:06,604 --> 00:33:09,504
i do believe she and i
have some unfinished business.

663
00:33:13,604 --> 00:33:14,904
you stay away from her.

664
00:33:14,904 --> 00:33:18,313
poor daniel. so little time,
so many sluts to defend.

665
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:33,868
it's fine. it's fine.
everyone can stop looking.

666
00:33:35,004 --> 00:33:37,304
he's a jerk...

667
00:33:38,004 --> 00:33:40,304
but it's my fault,
and--and i'm leaving.

668
00:33:40,304 --> 00:33:41,304
i--i'll go with you.

669
00:33:41,304 --> 00:33:42,594
actually,
i'd prefer if you didn't.

670
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:48,704
hope you're happy.

671
00:33:48,704 --> 00:33:50,804
not even close.

672
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:02,005
looks like
it's just you and me.

673
00:34:04,004 --> 00:34:05,704
apparently,
my room is available.

674
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:07,704
* shut up and drive,
drive, drive *

675
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:10,004
<i>some might call this
a "fustercluck,"</i>

676
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:13,678
<i>but on the upper east side,
we call it sunday afternoon.</i>

677
00:34:15,604 --> 00:34:19,704
dan, wait. i'm so sorry.
there's no--
there's no need to be.

678
00:34:19,704 --> 00:34:21,404
really, i shouldn't have come
here today. i made a mistake.

679
00:34:21,404 --> 00:34:23,604
no, you didn't. look, i'm sorry
about blair and chuck--

680
00:34:23,904 --> 00:34:25,804
it's not about
blair or chuck.

681
00:34:26,004 --> 00:34:27,704
i mean, it is,
but it's--it's not just them.

682
00:34:27,704 --> 00:34:31,379
no, i know. trust me, i know.
this world--it--it's crazy.

683
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:33,104
yeah, it--it is...

684
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,904
(sighs)
and you're a part of it.

685
00:34:36,304 --> 00:34:39,304
what, and you didn't
know that?

686
00:34:40,504 --> 00:34:41,684
i don't know.
i-i thought you were different.

687
00:34:44,004 --> 00:34:46,164
well, i'm sorry
i'm not who you thought i was,

688
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,613
but what's happened
is in the past,

689
00:34:52,204 --> 00:34:54,959
you know, and all i can do
is try to change.

690
00:34:57,604 --> 00:34:58,819
but if you
can't accept that,

691
00:35:00,004 --> 00:35:02,016
<i>then, you know, you're
not who i thought you were.</i>

692
00:35:08,304 --> 00:35:11,004
well, i guess
we both made mistakes.

693
00:35:34,304 --> 00:35:36,904
(jenny) hi.
hey, jen said
you went looking for serena.

694
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:37,904
did you find her?

695
00:35:37,904 --> 00:35:41,424
mm. yeah, yeah, i found her,
and, uh, and then i lost her.

696
00:35:44,104 --> 00:35:46,404
oh, uh, that's, uh...

697
00:35:46,404 --> 00:35:48,704
it's fine. it's fine.
really, it's all for the best.

698
00:35:48,804 --> 00:35:51,844
serena and her friends
and her family...

699
00:35:52,904 --> 00:35:54,504
her whole world...

700
00:35:55,004 --> 00:35:57,904
turns out it wasn't for me.

701
00:36:01,804 --> 00:36:04,304
wait, dan. what happened?

702
00:36:04,304 --> 00:36:06,604
did you tell blair waldorf
about cedric?

703
00:36:07,504 --> 00:36:08,508
i...

704
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:13,904
it may have come up.

705
00:36:13,904 --> 00:36:15,804
you can't trust
these people, jen.

706
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,904
don't tell 'em anything.

707
00:36:19,504 --> 00:36:20,830
they're nice flowers.

708
00:36:22,104 --> 00:36:23,095
they're hydrangeas.

709
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:30,004
look, blair,

710
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:32,334
either you try
to forgive me and move on...

711
00:36:35,004 --> 00:36:35,916
or we end it.

712
00:36:53,904 --> 00:36:56,104
* the faces all around me

713
00:36:56,104 --> 00:36:59,404
* they don't smile,
they just crack *

714
00:36:59,404 --> 00:37:01,904
* waiting for our ship to come

715
00:37:02,004 --> 00:37:04,604
* but our ship's
not coming back *

716
00:37:04,704 --> 00:37:08,304
<i>well, serena's mystery man
is a mystery no longer.</i>

717
00:37:08,404 --> 00:37:11,204
<i>his name is... oh, who cares?</i>

718
00:37:11,304 --> 00:37:14,838
<i>now that he and s. are over,
so are his 15 minutes.</i>

719
00:37:16,204 --> 00:37:17,204
<i>but his sister jenny</i>

720
00:37:17,204 --> 00:37:20,604
<i>was spotted with a new dress...
gifted from blair herself.</i>

721
00:37:20,604 --> 00:37:22,704
<i>everyone knows
an eleanor original</i>

722
00:37:22,804 --> 00:37:25,904
<i>is the uniform
of b.'s private army.</i>

723
00:37:26,304 --> 00:37:28,504
<i>but will j. be a loyal soldier</i>

724
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,204
<i>or will she side
with s.'s rebel forces?</i>

725
00:37:31,204 --> 00:37:33,104
<i>and as for s. herself,</i>

726
00:37:33,604 --> 00:37:36,604
<i>we hear that she left
today's brunch with nofriends,</i>

727
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:39,598
<i>no boy
and nowhere left to run.</i>

728
00:37:40,404 --> 00:37:46,004
* so give me something
to believe *

729
00:37:46,004 --> 00:37:51,122
* 'cause i am living
just to breathe *

730
00:37:51,804 --> 00:37:54,904
* and i need something more

731
00:37:54,904 --> 00:37:56,504
* to keep on breathing for

732
00:37:57,804 --> 00:38:03,104
* so give me something
to believe *

733
00:38:15,004 --> 00:38:16,704
<i>it looks like
the ultimate insider</i>

734
00:38:16,704 --> 00:38:18,704
<i>has become a total outsider.</i>

735
00:38:19,104 --> 00:38:21,304
<i>it's your move, serena,</i>

736
00:38:21,304 --> 00:38:23,504
<i>and you know
who will be watching--</i>

737
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:25,904
<i>gossip girl.</i>

738
