1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,300
Gossip girl here--

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,800
Your one and only source into the scandalous lives
of manhattan's elite.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,600
Oh, my god.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,000
You'll never believe
what's on "gossip girl."

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,400
Someone saw serena at grand central.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,200
I've waited my entire adolescent
life for a date with this girl.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,600
You'd really go out
with some guy you don't know?

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,600
Well, you can't be worse ????

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,000
You're going out
with serena,

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,700
And i'm going
to kiss on the lips.

11
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,200
Who said this family
wasn't cool?
Mm.

12
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,300
Why is my daughter going to one
of your concerts with your son?

13
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,200
If you want to be part
of this world, jenny,

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,300
You need to decide
if all this... is worth it.

15
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,000
Look, if you're ready to leave,
you tell us, okay?

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,800
No matter what mom says.

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,000
I would really like
to get out of here.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,200
I did this.

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,200
My mom kinda left us
a couple months ago.

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,200
My dad and my sister
don't really see that.

21
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,400
I dated a girl
like serena once.

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,900
Your wife would not want this ???

23
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,400
She doesn't do background checks
on prospective buyers,

24
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,100
And neither do i. Besides,
it's been almost 20 years.

25
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,700
And you still ????

26
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,800
Hey, how about
you ask me out again?

27
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,500
How about
you actually show up?

28
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay. No drama,
no disruptions, i promise.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,600
Promise? Oh, no! That means
it's never gonna happen now.

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,100
Aah! Okay, quick.
I take it back. I unpromise.

31
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,200
Friday. 8:00.

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,700
And who am i?

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,400
That's a secret
i'll never tell.

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,000
You know you love me.

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,500
X.O.X.O., gossip girl.

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,500
With blair's boyfriend nate

37
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,100
Helping to close up the family
yacht for the season,

38
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,300
Blair is free to focus

39
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,500
On the most important event
of the fall--

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,400
Her annual sleepover,

41
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,800
A tradition
since the year 2000,

42
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,400
Each one more decadent
than the last.

43
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,200
No expense or reputation
is spared.

44
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,700
With everything from trundle
beds to truffles in place,

45
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,500
All that's missing

46
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,600
Is sleepover star
and waldorf b.F.F.

47
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,200
Serena van der woodsen.

48
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,400
Hey, dad.
I'm headed to the bank.

49
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,600
You want me to deposit the check
from mom's sale while i'm there?

50
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,600
Did you knock over
a parking meter?

51
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,400
No, this is
the entire contents

52
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
From my teenage mutant
ninja turtle piggy bank.

53
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,200
How long can a man
have a piggy bank

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,100
And still call himself
a man?

55
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,400
I th--I thought it was time
to break donatello open.

56
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,000
So tonight's the big night,
huh?

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It is,
and i have it all planned.

58
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,400
6 pounds of plan, actually.

59
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,400
I know it's been a while since i took someone
on a date, but, uh,

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,100
Movie ticket prices haven't
risen that much, have they?

61
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,900
Dad, this is
serena van der woodsen.

62
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,300
I can't just take her
to a movie.

63
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,000
I want this to be perfect.

64
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,100
Um... check?

65
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,200
Want me to deposit it?

66
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,600
You still haven't
told her yet, have you?

67
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
Dad,
that's mom first sale.

68
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,000
That painting sold days ago.
It's kind of a huge deal.

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,600
I know, which is why
i was thinking

70
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,500
Of surprising her myself,
heading upstate to hudson,

71
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,400
Bringing her the check
in person. What?

72
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,200
Aren't i supposed
to deliver good news in person?

73
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,600
I think that's bad news.

74
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,800
Good news might just be fine
with a phone call.

75
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,600
So you're saying
i shouldn't go see her?

76
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,700
I'm saying, i don't think mom
is a huge fan of surprises.

77
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,500
Your remember her,
uh, 30th birthday

78
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,900
With the clown
and his llama?

79
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,300
Yeah, that didn't...

80
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,500
Didn't go over well.
It tanked.

81
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,900
Yeah. I'll call her first,
just to be safe.
Need some change for that?

82
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,600
Hey! Just the little sister
i was looking for.

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,700
I need answers,
and i need them now.

84
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,300
Your brother
is being very mysterious about our date tonight.

85
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,900
Well, he's a very mysterious
guy, apparently.

86
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,400
Look, he won't even tell me
where we're going.

87
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,100
Can you just give me a hint?

88
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,300
Are we going
to some secret club

89
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,800
To see the best unsigned band
in brooklyn?

90
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,900
Or--Or a guerilla art exhibit
in dumbo?

91
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,200
Or, hey, isn't the new york
film festival still going on?

92
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
You don't leave much room
for surprise, do you?

93
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,300
Well, i don't know
how to dress for surprise.

94
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,100
Not everything goes with it,
you know.

95
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,500
Well, i'd say jeans ???

96
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,200
The humphrey men
do casual friday every day.
Oh.

97
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,500
Oh, it's my brother.

98
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Oh, i say hi.
Eric, hey,

99
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,700
Jenny says hi.
Well, hi back.
Did she spill about tonight?

100
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,600
No, not a drop.
You all packed?
Yeah,????

101
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,100
Hey, speaking of which,
is mom still there?

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,900
Yeah, she's talking
to the doctor now.

103
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,300
I can't believe she's actually letting me
come home for a weekend.

104
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,800
I don't think i even remember
what a weekend is.

105
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,700
What time's your date? Maybe
we'll cross paths at the palace.
7:00.

106
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,900
Can't wait to see u
me, too. Bye.

107
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,600
'Kay, love you, eric.
Bye.

108
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,000
What was that i heard?
Eric's coming home?

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,900
Perfect timing.
How so?

110
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,600
Well, it gives your mother
and brother time to bond

111
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Alone tonight while
you get drunk on schnapps

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,700
And moon the n.Y.U. Dorms
from the limo.

113
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,500
Blair,????

114
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,600
S., it's only the most
important night of the fall.

115
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
Oh, the sleepover.

116
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,800
I prefer "soiree."

117
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,700
"Sleepover"
is so sophomore year.

118
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,400
Look, you know i can't go
to that. I have that plan.

119
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,800
Serena, when there's
a waldorf soiree,

120
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,600
There's nothing else
on the social calendar.

121
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,100
Blair, the plan is dan.

122
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,300
Remember, the guy you realized
is actually a human being

123
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,200
And worthy of your time
and attention?

124
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,600
No offense.
None taken.

125
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Look, i'm really sorry,
but this date is unbreakable.

126
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,300
Maybe we can swing by later
or something--
I'm not a stop along the way.

127
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm a destination,
and if you refuse to attend,

128
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,200
I'm gonna have to find
a replacement.

129
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,600
Girls, the waiting list.

130
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Okay. Well, uh,
i should get going.

131
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,600
Bye.
Good luck tonight.

132
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,400
Thank you.

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,300
Little jenny humphrey. Why
didn't i think of you before?

134
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,700
You have no plans.
You're coming to the soiree.

135
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,300
Me? Really?
Her? Really?

136
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,500
The thing is, if you come,
you'll have to be up

137
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,200
To a little more
than just sleeping.

138
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,900
I'm up for anything.

139
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,400
My place. 7:00 sharp.

140
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Okay. Bye.

141
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,900
Oh, a girl's first sleepover--

142
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,600
Something she'll never forget.

143
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,300
Let's make sure of it.

144
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,500
Taking bets
on how long she lasts?

145
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,900
50 bucks say an hour
and not 1 minute more.

146
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,700
I don't understand.
He said i was ready.

147
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,600
We talked about it
in our session this morning.

148
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
What he said

149
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,200
Is that you could come home,
not that you should.

150
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,600
But, mom, i thought--
I don't wanna argue about this.

151
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,300
I need time to think.

152
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,400
Please.
Look, i told the doctor i would
take it under advisement.

153
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,000
You can't just
walk out of here anyway.

154
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,700
There's papers
that have to be signed,

155
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,400
Release forms, insurance--
I can't believe you. You want
to keep me here forever.

156
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,300
If you still think
i'm "keeping you here,"

157
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,300
That just proves how not ready
you are to come home.

158
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,500
Look, we'll talk
about this tomorrow.

159
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,100
Yeah.
Yeah, you bet we will.

160
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,000
Hey.

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,700
Hey. Hey, uh,
am i early or...

162
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,400
Uh...
um...

163
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,800
No. No, i, uh,
i'm just running late.

164
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,700
Come in.

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,100
Um... excuse me while i go

166
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,700
Slip into something
less comfortable.

167
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,800
Sure, sure.

168
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,900
Talk to me while i change?

169
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,400
I will.
Okay.

170
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,200
Say, it's a nice place
that you and...

171
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,200
800 other people
have got here.

172
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Yeah, the, uh,
identical surroundings

173
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,400
Do make you crazy
after a little while.

174
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,500
Sometimes i feel like

175
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
I'm in a secret
government experiment.

176
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,700
Most government experiments

177
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,700
Don't have plasma tvs
or maid services.

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,400
Just something i've noticed.

179
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,000
Dan.

180
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Does serena know you're here?

181
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,200
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, she let me in.

182
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,300
At least,
i hope that was her.

183
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,300
She's about, uh,
yea tall and very blonde?

184
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,500
It makes jokes. Cute.

185
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Big shopping day?

186
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,400
I had a lot on my mind.

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,700
So where are you
taking my daughter tonight?

188
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,400
I... i don't know.

189
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,900
I thought maybe we'd do a walking tour
of new york underground,

190
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,800
Visit my friends
the mole people.

191
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,900
They're great, except they
only ever eat leftovers.

192
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,500
I'm sorry. I don't know why
i just said any of that.

193
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,900
I have--I have this thing,
this nervous tic

194
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,000
Where i never stop speaking,
like, ever.

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,400
In fact, when i was
a little boy, my mom used to say

196
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,700
There was never a word i met
that i didn't like.

197
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
You know what else i like?

198
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Your daughter.

199
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
I-I really like your daughter.
I...

200
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,100
Wow.

201
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,700
You're not wearing that
with that, are you?

202
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,300
Uh, mom...

203
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,800
Here. Wait.

204
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,900
Take this.

205
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh, thank you.

206
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,300
Hey, um, where's eric? I thought
he was gonna be home by now.

207
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,600
Oh, he was too tired
to come home tonight.

208
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,400
Mom.

209
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,400
Later.

210
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,400
Come on. Let's go.

211
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,200
Home by 1:00.
Bonus points for 12:45.

212
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,900
Oh, my god, a vespa!

213
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,600
I can't believe it!
I love vespas!

214
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,800
Oh, my gosh.
You don't understand.

215
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,000
I spent one of my favorite
summers riding all around italy

216
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,700
On one of these.
How did you know?

217
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,500
My mom won't let me
learn to drive

218
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,900
'Cause she says
that's what drivers are for,

219
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,700
But really, dan,
this is amazing. Really.

220
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,000
Come on.
Where are the helmets?

221
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Mr. Humphrey.

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,100
Is he--Is he ours?

223
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,800
Yeah.

224
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,100
Okay, great.

225
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
Spotted on the steps
of the palace--

226
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,800
Cinderella
stepping onto a pumpkin

227
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,500
Instead of her carriage.

228
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,900
Lucky for lonely boy,

229
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,100
There's more than one fable
filling our in-Box.

230
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,800
It's not bad.

231
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,500
I will take that
for you, yes?

232
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,500
Jenny! Oh, i'm so glad
you could make it.

233
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,700
Here's an inside tip,
little j.--

234
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,100
The faster you rise,
the harder you fall.

235
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,800
Hope that hello kitty
sleeping bag

236
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,300
Doubles as a parachute.

237
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,000
Let the games begin.

238
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Um,
how's the braised quail?

239
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,900
Very good, sir.

240
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,800
Mm. Okay.
And the, uh, the lay-Pin?

241
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,600
Lah-Pan. It's delightful.

242
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,400
Okay, what is that again?
Rabbit, sir.

243
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Oh, well,
i won't be having that.

244
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Um, how about chicken?

245
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,500
You can't go wrong with chicken.

246
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,800
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

247
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,700
Miss?
Uh, i'll have
the lobster bisque

248
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,800
And muscovy duck, please.

249
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,200
Thank you.
Merci, mademoiselle.

250
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,400
I can't believe
the waiter forgot me.

251
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,100
I was--I was just here...
the other day.

252
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah,
i come here for the crowd.

253
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,100
You wanna play
"mistress or second wife"?

254
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,900
Because it's harder
than it looks. Believe me.

255
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,900
So is her face.

256
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,400
Uh, will you excuse me?
I, uh...

257
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,600
I'm gonna go to the restroom
to freshen up a little.

258
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,700
Yeah, of course, of course.
I think the bathrooms are--

259
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,200
Uh, don't worry.
I'll find them.

260
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,800
Oh, excuse me, sir.

261
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,400
Uh, how much is that duck
she just ordered?

262
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,100
$78, sir.

263
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,600
Okay, right. Thank you.
Um, you know what?

264
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,100
Can you just cancel
my main dish,

265
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,800
And i'll just have
the appetizer as the main?

266
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,500
Of course, sir.

267
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,300
Thank you. Thank you. Merci.

268
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,900
Too beyonc?

269
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,700
Too mary-Kate.

270
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,200
Too hannah montana.

271
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,800
Wow. Even i'm impressed.

272
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,000
Um, i don't know.

273
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,100
I mean, don't really...
feel right.

274
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,800
Well, as my mother always says,
"fashion knows not of comfort."

275
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,500
All that matters
is the face you show the world,

276
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,600
And your face looks like
it's going to a bat mitzvah.

277
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,300
But before we continue
the renovation...

278
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,000
Martini.

279
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Oh, no, thanks.
I don't like vodka.

280
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,100
Oh, that's nice,
because this is gin,

281
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,200
As it should be.

282
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,500
It's a party, jenny.

283
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,600
Either swallow that or swipe
your metrocard back home.

284
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,800
It's up to you.

285
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,700
All right, people. Who's ready
for a game of "truth or dare"?

286
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, i love "truth or dare."

287
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,300
Once i had to eat
an entire bag of marshmallows.

288
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,100
That's nice, little humphrey,
but, um, that's not how we play.

289
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,900
Well, how do you play?

290
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,800
I think i'll go truth.

291
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,400
Hello? Hello?

292
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,300
What am i, a teenager?

293
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,700
Hello?

294
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,700
Yeah, hey,
i must have the wrong number.

295
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,900
Did you just call
a second ago?

296
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,700
Sorry about that,

297
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,100
But i--I'm pretty sure
this is the right number.

298
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,900
Who are you
trying to reach?

299
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,900
Is alison humphrey there?

300
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,200
Hold on a second.
She just got out of the shower.

301
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,200
Al? It's for you.

302
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,200
Who's calling?

303
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,100
Rufus humphrey.
Who is this?

304
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,300
Alexander bancroft,

305
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,200
Uh, just her--Just...
i'm--I'm a friend.

306
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,000
So am i, it seems.

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,900
I'm here. I'm here. Hello?

308
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,800
Thank you.

309
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
Are you sure you didn't want
any of my dinner?

310
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,900
You entrée was so small.
No, no, no, no.
It was amazing.

311
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,500
I didn't realize,
uh, fish could be creamed.

312
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,100
Would you like to see
the dessert menu?

313
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,000
Oh, no, thank you.
I think we're fine.

314
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Sure you don't want dessert?
Yeah.

315
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,200
Okay, well, then we'll
just get the check, please.

316
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,000
Uh, actually i already
took care of that earlier.

317
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,600
What?
Mm-Hmm.

318
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,300
Yeah, i-I just charged it
on my mom's card.

319
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,100
It's--It's not a big deal.
Don't worry about it.

320
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,000
You know, i can pay. It's not
like i don't have the money.

321
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,700
Yeah, i'm--I'm sure you do.

322
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,500
You just shouldn't have
to spend it here.

323
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I don't understand.
Did i do something wrong?

324
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,700
No. Look,
i wanted a date with you,

325
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Just not the date
you thought i wanted.

326
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,700
It's--It's fine.

327
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,400
All right, all right.

328
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Well, then...

329
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,800
If it's a real dan humphrey date
that you want,

330
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,200
Then it's
a real dan humphrey date

331
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
That you're gonna get.

332
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Let's go.
Really?

333
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,500
Yes. Mademoiselle.

334
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,800
Spotted fleeing dessert--

335
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,200
S. And lonely boy
lighter than air

336
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,700
And heading downtown.

337
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,500
It wasn't easy getting
the entire uniform, but...

338
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,100
Done and done.

339
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,400
What's the doorman wearing?

340
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,600
Don't you worry about that,
little j.

341
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,200
Just drink up.
You're lagging behind.

342
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,300
Oh, my phone.

343
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,100
"S.O.S. Still in prison."

344
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,700
Is that
eric van der woodsen?

345
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,200
I thought he went home
for the weekend.

346
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,300
Guess it didn't happen.

347
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,500
Is, why don't you
take the girls to visconti?

348
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,000
Meet you there in an hour?

349
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,400
Let's ramp this up,
shall we?

350
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,600
Truth or dare?

351
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,900
Oh, and you already used
your truth.

352
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,200
So... dare?

353
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,100
I dare you
to jailbreak eric.

354
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,900
Blair.

355
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,000
It's perfect. You want in,
and he wants out.

356
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,800
What's it gonna be?
Do or die, little j.?

357
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,800
Spotlight on little j,

358
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,500
Now put to the test
by one queen b.

359
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,000
Will j. Take the bait
and turn from brady to britney,

360
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,300
Or will
her goody two-Shoes mind-Set

361
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,800
Turn into the night's
biggest buzz kill?

362
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,700
Let's do it.

363
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,500
Surprise.

364
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,500
Jenny, hey.
Wh--What are you doing here?

365
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,100
Your s.O.S.
Was heard and answered.

366
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,500
Come on,
we're breaking you out.

367
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,100
Wait, how...

368
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,400
Wait, what do you mean "we"?

369
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,500
Okay, i have a problem.

370
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,500
I have a big problem.

371
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,700
It starts with a capital rx.

372
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,200
What drugs
have you been taking?

373
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,300
Mm, caffeine,

374
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,000
Nicotine, ketamine,

375
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,100
G.H.B., p.C.P., l.S.D.,

376
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,000
Di--Dri--Diazepam,

377
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Lorazepam.

378
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,400
All the pams, really.

379
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,800
You know,
i don't discriminate.

380
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,400
Apparently not.

381
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,300
Code yellow, floor six.

382
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,100
Why don't you wait
right here?

383
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
I'll get a doctor.

384
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,500
And i'd love a cappuccino.

385
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,300
Come on, let's go.

386
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,400
I heard you were bored,
and figured i owed you one.

387
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Yeah, try 50.

388
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Okay, come on.
Get a move on. Come on.

389
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Hello?

390
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
What?

391
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,000
How did this happen? Wh--

392
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,000
He was with who?

393
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,300
Young, blonde and beautiful.
Yep,

394
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,700
That's his sister.

395
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,100
I'll find them.

396
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,100
Thank you.

397
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,200
Ah, of course.

398
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,800
Ooh! And another one.

399
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,200
Sorry, joe.

400
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,900
That's game.

401
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,000
Uh, that's 75 bucks.
I think that pays for your duck.

402
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,700
That it does. Thank you.

403
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
So what now?

404
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,400
You play me.

405
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,600
You?

406
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,100
Yeah, unless you're afraid to lose.

407
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,300
I think the only thing being lost in this game
would be your dignity.

408
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,200
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

409
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,600
- You think so?
- I think so.

410
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,700
Well, then rack 'em up.
I'll buy us a soundtrack.

411
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,000
This better not be my wife.

412
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,200
Rufus, do you always
answer the phone like that?

413
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,800
Lily?

414
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Listen, i need your son's cell
phone number. It's an emergency.

415
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,300
A real emergency
or a lily emergency?

416
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,900
Eric is missing.

417
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,700
Missing?

418
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,300
From where?

419
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,400
From...

420
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,000
His--His room here...

421
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
At the hotel.

422
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,300
I--I'm trying
to get in touch with him,

423
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,100
But he's not answering his
phone. I think he's with serena.

424
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,300
Did you try her?

425
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,800
She left her phone here.

426
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,500
Your son's cell number--
That's all i need.

427
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,800
They're on a date, lil.

428
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,400
If they picked eric up along the way,

429
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,000
I bet they're having fun.

430
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,500
I have a situation here.

431
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,900
A situation? Your son is
with your daughter and my kid.

432
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,600
I trust them.
Why don't you?

433
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,400
Rufus.

434
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,800
Good-Bye, lily.
Always a pleasure.

435
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,000
Hey, baby, you want to, uh,

436
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,500
Maybe show me to the bathroom,

437
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,400
Get lost somewhere
around the coat check?

438
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,600
Well, my answer is usually
"never say never,"

439
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,100
But for you,
i'll make an exception.

440
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,400
Oh!

441
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,100
Who let the hedge fund mafia
in here?

442
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,400
I thought matchy-Matchy
was over.

443
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,200
So eric's here.

444
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,200
Now it's your turn.
Truth or dare?

445
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,500
Do you have to ask?

446
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,100
I dare you to make out with that guy.

447
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,300
Easy.

448
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
And mean it.

449
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,800
Watch and learn,
little humphrey.

450
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,100
I hope amanda
never finds out.

451
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,100
Who's amanda?

452
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,800
Just my girlfriend.

453
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,900
Amanda never has to know,
does she?

454
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,800
Well, i'm not telling her.

455
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,900
Look what i got.

456
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,700
I dare you to call his girlfriend.

457
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,000
Her name's amanda.

458
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,800
Done and done.

459
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,200
Hello?

460
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,500
Amanda?

461
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,800
Hi. This is bl--

462
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Claire.

463
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,100
Yeah,

464
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,100
I just had my tongue
down your boyfriend's throat,

465
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,300
And he neglected to tell me you existed
until after it was over.

466
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,600
Just thought you should know.

467
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,200
He's a real catch.

468
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Bye.

469
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,600
All right,
sleepover of the year.

470
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,500
Whoo!

471
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,700
Hey, everybody's
gotta start somewhere.

472
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,900
Maybe little j.
Isn't so little anymore.

473
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,800
Oh!

474
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,500
Oh, no!

475
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,800
Game over.

476
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,300
You lost fair and square,

477
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
And that's squared.

478
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,300
Oh! Am i really that bad?

479
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,500
There aren't enough words
to describe the kind of bad you are.

480
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,800
Well, you promised if you
lost again, you'd teach me.

481
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,400
All right. All right.

482
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,700
That's a promise i intend to keep,
not just for you,

483
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,900
But for dive bars everywhere
all across america.

484
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,000
All right, come here.

485
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,600
Now you have to remember,
in pool, it's all about--

486
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Take this stick--

487
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,600
Remember, it's all about the angles,
the right angle, of course.

488
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,500
- Mm-Hmm.
- Take the shot.

489
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Okay.

490
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Um,
bring your hand back ...

491
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,900
- ... Here.
- Right.

492
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,300
And, uh, wait.
Oh, okay. Hold on.

493
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,200
You gotta be slow and just follow through,
all right?

494
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh!

495
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,300
Oh! This is my song.
Finally.

496
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,000
I didn't know you liked
this kind of music.

497
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,800
I think we've already established
the things you don't know about me.

498
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,700
Oh, oth--Other than you're ...

499
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,400
Total lack of pools skills,

500
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,500
What else?

501
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,300
That i'm having
the best time right now?

502
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,200
That i knew.

503
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,700
Ahem. There's something
vibrating in your pocket,

504
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,200
And i really hope it's your phone.

505
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,100
Hold on.

506
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,900
Oh, it's my dad.

507
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,300
He knows i'm with you.
He wouldn't call if it wasn't important.

508
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,900
Oh, yeah, of course.
Take it.

509
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,400
Hello?

510
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,400
What?
No, no, no, he's not.

511
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,200
Serena left her phone
at the hotel?

512
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,100
What? What's up?

513
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dad,
she's standing right here next to me.

514
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,300
We'll take care of it.

515
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,100
Wait, take care of what?

516
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,700
Slight change of plans.

517
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,600
No! No, no. No change of plans.

518
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,100
I like this plan of you
teaching me the angles.

519
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,700
I know.

520
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,200
Remember, cute girl
with total lack of pool skills?

521
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,100
I remember.

522
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
So does the table.

523
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,200
Come on, what could it possibly be
that's more important than this right here?

524
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

525
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,500
Actually, it can't.

526
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,100
You need to call
your brother right now.

527
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,100
- Hey. I was just about--
- So i made some calls,

528
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,500
But as it turns out, none of my people know
your people. Shocking, but true.

529
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,300
Either "dan humphrey" is an alias
or your son is not very popular.

530
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Regardless,
i need that number.

531
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
I realized when i got off the phone with you

532
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,000
That i could've been
a little bit more understanding.

533
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,900
- You think--
- I called dan.

534
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
Thank you.

535
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,200
And your son's
not with them.

536
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,000
He's not?

537
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,300
But serena got eric
on the phone, and he's okay,

538
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,300
And dan said they would phone
when they were all together.

539
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,300
Yeah,

540
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,000
And you didn't think
to call and tell me all of this?

541
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,800
I was just about to.

542
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,500
Now i hate to say this, but why
don't you sit and wait here?

543
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,900
We should hear from them soon.

544
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,000
Fine.

545
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,300
And i'll pass on a glass of that
nonpremium liquor that you're drinking.

546
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,200
But i will take
something to eat.

547
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,800
Thank you for offering.

548
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
What? You still know
how to cook, don't you?

549
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,800
Do you see jenny
or your brother?

550
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,400
No.

551
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,100
Are you her?
Are you claire?

552
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,600
What? No.

553
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,100
Uh, are you sure
we're in the right place?

554
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,300
Yeah.

555
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,700
Come on.

556
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,900
- Where is she?
- Hey! Whoa, whoa. Baby. What?

557
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,800
Who? I'm here
at the club with the guys.

558
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,500
Hey!

559
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,800
Excuse me. Hello.

560
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,500
- Where's my phone?
- Hey, hey, let go of her.

561
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,800
- Who the hell are you?
- Your phone is at our table.

562
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,500
If you weren't so drunk and drooling over
every girl in this place,

563
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,100
- You would've seen that.
- I'm gonna kill you.

564
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,500
Oh, you must be amanda, right?

565
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,700
Well, i would think twice
before marrying him 'cause he's a pig.

566
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,500
Wait. Hey, hey.
Back off of her, okay?

567
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,300
I don't need you to defend me.

568
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,300
It wasn't even her who called you.

569
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,200
It was me.

570
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,100
- Jenny?
- So she's the one with the tongue?

571
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,300
Tongue?

572
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
Tongue--
What are you even doing here?

573
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
You're supposed to be at a sleepover.

574
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,000
You made out with a girl from a ????

575
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,500
You made out with him?
Wait, i made out with her.

576
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
It was a dare.

577
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,300
A dare?
What are you, children?

578
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,900
Yeah, pretty much. She's 14?!

579
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,800
- 14?!
- 14?!

580
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,700
Jesus. No, i swear i had no idea, baby.

581
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,600
I mean, look at her. I mean, she's jailbait.

582
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,400
What--What's that?

583
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,900
Dan, stay out of it, okay?

584
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,600
You're just causing more problems
than you're solving.

585
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,700
The only thing is the cocktail napkin
you're wearing.

586
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,100
You got it.
That's what i'm talking about.

587
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,300
You're not talking about anything.

588
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,300
Dan! Hey!

589
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
All right, all you out
before i call the cops.

590
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,400
All right, all right.

591
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Hey, serena.

592
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,700
See? I told you everything was okay.

593
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,800
Let's go, come on.

594
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,600
Eric, come on.

595
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,500
Spotted--

596
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,900
Big brother
to the not-Quite rescue.

597
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,500
Too bad no one told him you can't save
a damsel if she loves her distress.

598
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,200
What's wrong with the sauce?

599
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,900
Mm, oh, nothing, i'm just so happy
to have a home-Cooked meal.

600
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,400
- It just needs a little salt.
- What? It's perfect.

601
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,400
No, just a--Just a pinch.

602
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,300
You haven't changed a bit.
You always have to be in control.

603
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,200
Well, i don't remember
you complaining.

604
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,900
Well, i wasn't allowed to.
It was one of your rules.

605
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,400
Yeah, well, i may hold
the reins a little tight,

606
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,400
But life is complicated,
especially once you have kids.

607
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,700
You know, when they're little,
you're their whole world.

608
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,400
And then one day,
the wall goes up,

609
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,400
And you're on one side,
and they're on the other.

610
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,300
Well, they don't like
to admit it,

611
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,200
- But they want us to break through.
- Yeah, well, maybe serena,

612
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,300
But eric-- I don't know what he wants.

613
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,200
You're off concerning about
a 14-Year-Old boy breaking curfew.

614
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,000
Well, it's not my curfew
he's breaking.

615
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,600
He's been staying
at the ostroff center.

616
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,300
- Ostroff center?
- Mm-Hmm. Yeah.

617
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,400
Is it drugs? Drinking?

618
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,500
Um, no,
he's not a bad kid.

619
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
He's just--Just, um,

620
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,600
A lonely one.

621
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,100
It's depression?

622
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,600
Is it bad?

623
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,700
Bad enough
to try to kill himself.

624
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,100
I'm sorry.

625
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,200
No, i don't know why.

626
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,500
I don't know what i did
or i didn't do, but...

627
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,700
I just don't know
what to do to--

628
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,600
To make sure
it doesn't happen again.

629
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,000
All you can do
is be there for them.

630
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,900
Oh, i hope that's dan
or serena.

631
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,300
Hello?

632
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,300
Hey, great.

633
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,100
Uh, yeah.

634
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,900
Actually, i can tell her.
His mother's here with me.

635
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,400
It's a long story.

636
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Sounds good. Take care.

637
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
So he's with dan and serena,

638
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,700
And everyone's fine.

639
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,200
All right,
i should go meet them.

640
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,200
I'll wrap this up.

641
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,200
No. You know what?
This isn't gonna travel well.

642
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,900
Why don't i just stay here
and i can eat it quickly?

643
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,600
It would be a shame
to let it go to waste.

644
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,500
What were you thinking?

645
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,400
He was bored.

646
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,300
He wanted to get out and have some fun.

647
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,600
So you took him to a bar?

648
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,200
He didn't do anything wrong.

649
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
I thought you'd be happy.

650
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,400
Well, i'm not, okay?
I-I can't believe that you did this.

651
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,100
Hey, i wasn't kidnapped, serena.

652
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,000
I left of my own free will.

653
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,800
Blair was trying to do me a favor.

654
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,600
Told you.

655
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,800
Well, it's no favor, eric.
You're in a lot of trouble.

656
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,700
Yeah, i know,

657
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,400
And you know what?
It was worth it...

658
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,100
To be out after dark

659
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,900
And to talk to someone
who isn't just you or mom,

660
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,000
Even if it is blair.

661
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,400
No offense.

662
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,600
None taken.

663
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,900
Well, i'm sorry
this was the only way.

664
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,000
We'll work on mom, okay?

665
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,900
Thanks.

666
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,200
And since she knows
you're okay,

667
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
I guess there's
no real reason to rush.

668
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,300
How about we walk?

669
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,900
Oh, call me.

670
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
Yeah, i will.

671
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,200
I was talking to eric.

672
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,700
What is wrong with you?
This is not who you are.

673
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,700
And who are you right now?
Dad?

674
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,800
Uh, we are not
doing this right now.

675
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,100
We can do this at home.
Let's go.

676
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,700
Except i'm not going home.
I'm going with my friends.

677
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,100
Coming, jenny?

678
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,200
Yeah. One second.

679
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,700
Look, all right, i'm sorry that things
got out of hand tonight.

680
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,900
To say the least.

681
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,800
I know who blair and those girls are,

682
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,700
But i know who i am,

683
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,100
And i'm not gonna forget that
just 'cause i hang out with them.

684
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,900
Come on! We're leaving!

685
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,500
I'm coming!

686
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,200
Just let me go. Please?

687
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,500
I mean, look, i'll be tucked
in bed in a half-Hour.

688
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,800
I promise.

689
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,200
Uh, all right, all right,
all right. Yeah, go ahead.

690
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,400
Thank you.

691
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,000
Hey.

692
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,600
I, uh, i gotta take him
back to the center.

693
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
So we should probably just call it a night.

694
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,400
What? No, no, no, no, no.
I'll go with you.

695
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,800
No, it's okay.
You don't have to.

696
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
I want to.

697
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,500
Come on. Let's go.

698
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,300
This just in--"Truth or dare"
has gone into overtime.

699
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,000
Looks like
no one told little j.

700
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,500
That you don't beat a waldorf
at her own game.

701
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
You want me to steal
the jacket from the mannequin?

702
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
That's right.

703
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,400
Blair,
it's your mom's store.

704
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,800
I mean, you could have anything you want.

705
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,000
So can you...

706
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,800
Unless you don't want to,

707
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,200
Which is totally understandable,

708
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,900
And i wouldn't judge you
for that.

709
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,100
I don't get it.

710
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,500
Then you don't have to do it.

711
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,800
It's just a shame,
'cause you've come so far.

712
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,200
The jacket?

713
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,900
Just the jacket.

714
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
Oh, god.

715
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,000
Five, four, three,

716
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,300
Two, one.

717
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,600
Okay, come on, run.

718
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,000
Guys! Come back! Let me out!

719
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,500
Are you still the same guy
you were when i took this photo?

720
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,700
What? You took that photo?
You weren't even at that show.

721
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,200
Oh, excuse me.

722
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,200
If i remember,
the first song was about me,

723
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,300
The second one
was about ...

724
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,900
Your motorcycle

725
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,300
And then there was the one about
that surf town. What was it?

726
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,500
Sayulita.

727
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,200
Fishermen's town.

728
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,500
Was that the one
with the villa where we...

729
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,300
Yes, indeed, it was.

730
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,300
God, i must have taken
eight rolls of film that night.

731
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,000
Wh--Why did you
give up photography anyway?

732
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,500
You loved it so much.

733
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,600
Well,
i guess i figured, um,

734
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,700
Social climbing
would be more fulfilling.

735
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,600
I even remember the black dress
i wore that night.

736
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,100
- Really?
- Yeah.

737
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,900
You know, i think
it may have actually been blue.

738
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,700
I thought you said you didn't
remember me being there.

739
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,200
Uh, can you grab that, lil?
And if it's my son

740
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,500
Be nice to him.

741
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,600
Hello, humphrey residence.

742
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
Hi, alison.

743
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,600
Yeah, it's, um, lily.

744
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,200
Yeah. H-Hold on. Just...

745
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,400
Alison?

746
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,800
Looks like you're gonna have
some explaining to do.

747
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,600
Trust me, i don't owe alison
any explanation right now.

748
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,800
You know what?
I've overstayed my welcome.

749
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,700
Okay.

750
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,000
I hope everything
turns out all right.

751
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,500
Yeah, me, too.

752
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,100
Thanks for babysitting me,

753
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,200
And thank you for being
such a good friend.

754
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Yeah.

755
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,800
It was almost fun.

756
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,700
Good night, rufus.

757
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,800
I'm gonna need you to show me some form
of identification, miss.

758
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,900
I'm only 14.

759
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,900
I don't have any.

760
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,300
What are you doing out
at this hour?

761
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,700
- I, um...
- What's your name?

762
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,200
My name is blair waldorf.

763
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,600
This is my mother's shop.

764
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,800
Her name is eleanor.

765
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,700
I left my jacket here earlier,

766
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,400
I mean--Which irritates
my mother to no end.

767
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,300
And i completely forgot
about the alarm.

768
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,300
All right, what's your home
phone number so we can call her?

769
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,700
Oh, she's not home. I mean,
she's in paris until thursday.

770
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,600
It's six hours ahead
if you want to call.

771
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
She's gonna be so angry.

772
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,500
Well, look, we can't just let you go
without confirming your story.

773
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,400
I have my own set of keys.

774
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,400
You can watch me lock up.

775
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,100
Well, i can see why your brother
would want to leave.

776
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,700
That place is, uh,
is very depressing.

777
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,500
And yet, it's designed
to treat depression.

778
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,200
He's a good kid--Eric.
He is.

779
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,300
Yeah.

780
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,900
Jenny's not so bad either.

781
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,900
Yeah?

782
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
- Yeah.
- Yeah, i-I-I know. I know.

783
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,800
I just worry
about her sometimes.

784
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,900
Well,
worry looks cute on you.

785
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,400
Look, i've seen
jenny in action,

786
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
And my hunch is

787
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,100
She doesn't let herself get pushed
in anything she doesn't want to do.

788
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,200
No, i-I know. I know.
It's just...

789
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,600
She's never mentioned that
her idea of a great friday night

790
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,300
Consists of painting her face
full of makeup,

791
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,100
And stumbling out to a hip bar
in high heels

792
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,100
And hanging out with a bunch
of drunk wall streeters

793
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,700
Who don't even care if she has a name.

794
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,000
Well, maybe that wasn't her idea
for a great friday night.

795
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,700
What do you mean?

796
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,700
It's okay for her to want to be friends
with the people she goes to school with.

797
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,500
Why?

798
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,600
I'm not.

799
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,200
And if you made
half the effort she did,

800
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Maybe we would've met
a long time ago.

801
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
That's true.

802
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,700
Then so maybe you would've
kissed me already.

803
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,200
No five-Star restaurants.

804
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,100
No town car.

805
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,200
No smoky pool hall
or bad '80s music.

806
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,000
Looks like we finally found
common ground.

807
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,000
Hey, mom.

808
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,500
Sorry about tonight.

809
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,300
No, we'll talk about it
in the morning,

810
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,700
After you've had a good night's
sleep in your own bed.

811
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
I'm going home?

812
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,300
I'm not sure exactly how
this is gonna work, you know.

813
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,400
Hey, i'm not worried.

814
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,300
It's a good thing
i didn't unpack.

815
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Catch.

816
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,700
Jenny?

817
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,700
Looks like
you came to play after all.

818
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,700
You know which trundle bed
is yours.

819
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,700
Sleep tight.
You've earned it.

820
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,100
Actually, i'm going home,

821
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,000
But, uh,

822
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,200
Thanks for inviting me.
It was a blast.

823
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,700
What do you mean
you're going home?

824
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,400
Nobody ever
leaves a sleepover.

825
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,700
Well, i guess there's firsts
for everything.

826
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,600
Oh, and i'm keeping
the jacket,

827
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,600
If that's okay with you.

828
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,300
Monday?

829
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,200
Lunch on the steps?

830
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,900
Done and done.

831
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,700
Word is jenny humphrey killed
at blair waldorf's sleepover.

832
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,900
It was a debut the likes of which
haven't been seen since blair herself.

833
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,200
If blair's
gotta watch her back,

834
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,500
Serena's needs to keep an eye
on her heart.

835
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,900
We hear it may have been stolen
by lonely boy.

836
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,800
Putting out an a.P.B,

837
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,100
Gossip girl.

838
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,100
