1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,558
Gossip girl here...

2
00:00:01,559 --> 00:00:05,398
your one and only source into the
scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.

3
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:07,190
Blair, ever since you walked
into the gallery last week,

4
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:08,524
i haven't been able to
stop thinking about you.

5
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:11,358
Is it too weird to think that maybe
fate brought us back together again?

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,087
I was up all night finishing
the story for noah shapiro.

7
00:00:14,088 --> 00:00:16,694
- The guy from "the paris review"? Which story?
- The one about chuck bass.

8
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:19,578
- You said you couldn't write that story.
- No, i could always write it. I chose not to.

9
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:21,229
You should do your own clothing line.

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,331
I can model them. Max
will do some photos.

11
00:00:23,332 --> 00:00:26,019
If you think you're getting away
with this, you are dead wrong.

12
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,316
It's too late. It's done.

13
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:32,173
Gossip Girl 210

14
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:35,061
Synchro : Flolo

15
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:38,128
French Gossip girl Team

16
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:40,902
x.o.x.o., gossip girl.

17
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:50,214
You're in for a real treat, son.

18
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:52,427
I even amazed myself
with this bolognese.

19
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:56,419
I'm amazed at how calm you're acting.
Your 15-year-old daughter's moved in

20
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:04,888
granted, agnes' mother's more
courtney love than june cleaver, but

21
00:01:04,889 --> 00:01:06,809
she's a committed parent,

22
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,239
and she's gone through
similar phases with agnes.

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,302
She promises to call
every day, so jenny's safe.

24
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:14,233
You're gonna act like
you're cool with it

25
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:16,383
so she chooses to come home
instead of being forced.

26
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:19,292
That's risky, but i like it.

27
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:21,903
- i hope it works.
- yeah.

28
00:01:21,972 --> 00:01:24,820
- so you ready for the best sauce ever?
- you know, actually,

29
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:27,647
i can't stay. I'm gonna meet
shapiro, and i know you don't agree

30
00:01:27,648 --> 00:01:29,861
with me writing a story
about chuck and his mother...

31
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:32,075
i don't believe in using other
people to get what you want.

32
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:33,907
Shapiro loved the story.

33
00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:36,319
He's writing me the
recommendation for yale.

34
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:39,143
Congratulations. I'm happy for ya.

35
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:43,335
I'm happy for you and your sister both.

36
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,638
I'm glad you're a musician

37
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,303
and not an actor, dad, 'cause
our family would have starved.

38
00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:51,826
Save me some cold pasta?

39
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:54,984
- i'll leave it on the stove for you.
- all right.

40
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:01,478
Though it seems like just yesterday

41
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,053
serena and i were 8 and playing
dress-up in my mother's vintage manolos,

42
00:02:05,054 --> 00:02:08,104
my 18th birthday has finally arrived.

43
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:11,603
The party needs to be perfect,
so blood orange martinis

44
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:15,020
or beluga and belvedere? Why don't we make
different drinks tonight and do a taste test?

45
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:18,739
I can't. I'm meeting my
mother's new boyfriend.

46
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,410
Even moms have boyfriends, and i don't.

47
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:25,590
Cyrus has been one of my mom's
attorneys since the divorce.

48
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:28,852
He asked her out when they first met but
she didn't wanna mix business with pleasure.

49
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:31,411
Finally, his amorous
overtures wore her down,

50
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:34,484
and she agreed to dinner.
She's been smitten ever since.

51
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:36,768
Oh, that's so romantic.

52
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:39,323
One thing my mom has
is good taste in men.

53
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:41,491
Maybe a dashing stepdad
is just what i need.

54
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:45,559
Speaking of good taste in men,
how's the sexy artist, serena?

55
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,553
Aaron's amazing.

56
00:02:47,554 --> 00:02:50,601
He's been sending me these maps
to the most beautiful places.

57
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:53,258
The other day i ended up in a
private room in the cloisters

58
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:56,154
- overlooking the gardens.
- spare them the details.

59
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:58,677
Hazel will kill herself from envy.

60
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:03,618
This is him again. I gotta go.

61
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:07,913
- what? What about my party?
- blood orange martinis all the way.

62
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,684
You girls have been
getting a lot of press.

63
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:13,433
- you got talent. Who's the designer?
- it's me.

64
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:16,919
And i'm the face of the line and
the brains behind the operation.

65
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,925
- who do you imagine your client will be?
- girls like us.

66
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:21,949
Sophisticated girls with a
bit of edge who can afford

67
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,187
high-end product, and i know these girls
and their style because i'm their peer,

68
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:27,716
so that's what makes
me unique as a designer.

69
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:29,828
What's the name of the label?

70
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,567
We haven't fully decided yet,
clearly, but, it really doesn't matter,

71
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:36,445
'cause we're just here to take
the work to the next level.

72
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:39,133
Definitely, which means finding
a clear vision for the brand.

73
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:41,820
Which since fashion is a
designer-based industry,

74
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,062
and i'm a designer,
that brand would be me.

75
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:47,248
No, the brand is the concept,
which we both came up with.

76
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:49,555
Can we just talk about this
later when we're alone, please?

77
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:54,232
No, we're gonna talk about this now.
If mr. Smith here wants to represent us,

78
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,906
- then he should know who he's dealing with.
- except mr. Smith

79
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:58,764
might get the wrong idea
about our professionalism.

80
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:02,179
Then cut the crap and start acting professional
instead of putting on the jenny show.

81
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,839
Me? Agnes, look at who's
acting out yet again

82
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,321
- in another business meeting.
- you wanna see acting out?

83
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:11,630
And yet another one
bites the dust, agnes.

84
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:14,210
What is the matter with you?
This guy was our last chance.

85
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:17,435
Okay, he totally overreacted.
I mean, we're artists.

86
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:20,237
We need to work with somebody
who's not gonna be freaked out

87
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,684
- by a little bit of passion.
- passion? You know the heat

88
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:25,227
from the fashion show's
not gonna last that long.

89
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:27,917
I will find us another
business manager tomorrow.

90
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,822
Good, because until we get one,
we can't meet with any buyers.

91
00:04:30,823 --> 00:04:34,779
Yes. Okay? Now it's all gonna
work out, all right? And i'm on it.

92
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:39,108
- dorota.
- dorota!

93
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:41,299
Hurry up. Cyrus will be here any minute.

94
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,192
He is the most attractive,
brilliant man i have ever met.

95
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:48,886
- darling, you're gonna love him.
- i kind of already do.

96
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:51,191
I'm so excited to meet him.

97
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:57,897
I told you to put the roses on
the table next to cyrus' seat.

98
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,544
Cary grant always looked
his best with white roses.

99
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:03,070
Dorota, are you insane?

100
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:05,374
- i don't know.
- you used the everyday china.

101
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,166
Cyrus will think we're just
common upper middle class.

102
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,148
- go get the objet, and hurry up.
- yes, miss blair.

103
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:14,406
Eleanor, you look like a goddess.

104
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:17,398
- that must be his driver.
- and you're more handsome than ever.

105
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:19,854
Not enough!

106
00:05:26,987 --> 00:05:30,474
Darling, come meet cyrus rose.

107
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:34,292
The lovely blair. Come here!

108
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:36,809
Not enough!

109
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:50,746
Happy 20th anniversary
for bass industries.

110
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:54,926
- surprised you remembered.
- not only did i remember i got you something.

111
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,926
You once told me that you snuck

112
00:05:57,927 --> 00:06:00,307
into hockey games as a
kid, sat in the back row.

113
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:01,866
You bought a box for the season?

114
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:04,289
I thought you could revisit
your childhood passion in style.

115
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,927
We can go to rangers
games together, hang out.

116
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:10,637
Nice gesture, but, misguided as usual.

117
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:15,521
I don't have time for
hockey games. You know that.

118
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:32,552
I always knew you had chops, humphrey.

119
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:37,034
- here's your letter. Have a seat.
- thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

120
00:06:37,035 --> 00:06:39,296
Don't thank me yet.
There's more to come.

121
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:42,875
Meet james wolf, senior
editor at "new york magazine."

122
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:44,113
It's nice to meet you.

123
00:06:44,176 --> 00:06:46,113
Shapiro took
the liberty of showing me your piece.

124
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,396
I'm very interested.

125
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:52,286
I'm, i'm flattered. "New york magazine"
doesn't normally publish fiction.

126
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:57,027
- it's not really fiction, though, is it?
- i told james the trout character

127
00:06:57,028 --> 00:06:59,849
is based on chuck bass,
son of bartholomew.

128
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,695
It's the 20th anniversary
of bass industries.

129
00:07:02,696 --> 00:07:05,945
We want an exposé on the
man behind the company.

130
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:09,067
You dated the stepdaughter.
You know the son.

131
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:12,584
Yeah, look, the last thing i
need is bart bass as an enemy.

132
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:15,337
Yeah, and i'm really
not the undercover type.

133
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:17,379
If you're afraid of the man's wrath,

134
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,683
we won't print your name,
but if your reporting's

135
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:22,649
as good as your fiction,
i'll assign you another piece.

136
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,349
Look, i'm sorry, sir,
but he's not an idiot.

137
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,165
He's gonna know it came from me.

138
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,016
We'll only print something if
it's true and can be verified.

139
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:34,217
If the man's clean, the story goes away.

140
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:37,225
If he's not, that's on him, isn't it?

141
00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:43,105
You just grew a pair,
humphrey. Don't lose them now.

142
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:46,604
This opportunity could
open real doors for you.

143
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:19,173
What? How did you do that? I
mean, it's amazing, but why?

144
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:22,925
You know, i've shown you the
most beautiful places i know,

145
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:25,782
and now i'm showing the
beautiful places you.

146
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,022
This is nothing, though.
I want you to pose for me.

147
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:33,649
- will you?
- sure, i guess.

148
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:36,398
Yes! Yes.

149
00:08:36,862 --> 00:08:39,622
I can't believe this.

150
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:58,944
Spotted... s. And a. Bringing
sexy back to times square.

151
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:02,615
Move over, disney. 42nd
street is steaming up.

152
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,710
I called you, like,
ten times last night.

153
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:13,240
Where have you been? I went
to the dentist at lunch and

154
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:15,194
,yesterday i met aaron in times square.

155
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:18,350
- it was the most romantic thing.
- who cares about plaque or

156
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:21,220
pretentious artists when your
best friend's having a meltdown?

157
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:23,161
- he's totally unsuitable.
- who is?

158
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,785
Cyrus. He's 5 feet tall.

159
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:28,748
He has a catchphrase, and he's a hugger.

160
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:31,591
I was expecting cary grant,
and i got danny devito.

161
00:09:31,592 --> 00:09:33,499
That sounds...

162
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,687
awful. Sorry. I gotta run. Oh, aaron?

163
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:41,394
Yeah. He asked me to pose for
him in his studio, to be his muse.

164
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:43,608
- and you said yes?
- why not? It's romantic.

165
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:46,902
No, it's a death trap. Being
the muse never works out.

166
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:50,745
Plenty of women have been both lover
and muse to famous artists, like picasso.

167
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:53,418
Serena, a guy starts
out in his blue period,

168
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:56,792
and everything's great, but it's only a
matter of time before he's all into cubism,

169
00:09:56,793 --> 00:09:58,976
and it's some other girl's eye coming
out of her forehead.

170
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:00,550
I'm gonna go.

171
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:03,260
Wait! No, what about the
gnome? I have to take him down.

172
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:05,971
B., enough already. You
always said you wanted to be

173
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,784
an elegant woman at 18 like grace kelly.

174
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:10,610
You're right.

175
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,203
I'm going to be an adult.
I'll try and tolerate him.

176
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:15,355
Good girl.

177
00:10:17,846 --> 00:10:19,339
This has been great.

178
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,367
Mr. Bass, thank you for
answering my questions.

179
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:24,054
- anything for a friend of serena's.
- as i mentioned, i'm just...

180
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:27,076
i'm kinda over the writing thing, and
i wanna see what else is out there.

181
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:29,793
You're easily the most
successful person i know,

182
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:31,987
so i figured why not at the top, right?

183
00:10:32,324 --> 00:10:35,089
Yeah, i was hoping that i might
be able to shadow you for just

184
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,332
a few days a week after school.

185
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,612
I'm a busy man, daniel.
I don't think that's gonna be possible.

186
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:44,533
Yeah, of course. I don't want to impose.
It's just... you know...

187
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:47,567
my dad... his
world is pretty narrow.

188
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:52,030
He may have had a hit song in the '90s but
he didn't build half the manhattan skyline.

189
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:55,396
Your father's a fine man, but,

190
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:57,705
i can see how you'd want something more.

191
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,595
Why don't we start with two days a week?

192
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,498
That's, that's more
than enough. Thank you.

193
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,999
Agnes, it's 3:00. I have
been waiting up for you

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,961
at the apartment since
8:00 this morning.

195
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:14,670
Will you lower your voice?

196
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:17,058
Your high-pitched shrill is
not helping my pounding head.

197
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:21,434
Excuse me? Waitress, can
i get, a revive? Thank you.

198
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:25,056
Where the hell were you? I
went out with max last night,

199
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:27,311
and then we ran into some friends,

200
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,457
and it was really good.
You should have come.

201
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,313
Then you should have answered
your phone or at least turned it on

202
00:11:32,314 --> 00:11:34,746
so that you could hear
the 50 messages i left you.

203
00:11:34,747 --> 00:11:36,444
What are you, my mother?

204
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,079
No, agnes, i am your
partner! And you promised

205
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,007
that you'd find us a new
business manager today.

206
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:45,699
And i will do it on monday or
today, if my hangover ever wears off.

207
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,871
Do you understand how much
i've given up for this?

208
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:51,708
- yes.
- no, agnes, you don't.

209
00:11:52,622 --> 00:11:54,631
I left home.

210
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:56,579
I quit my job,

211
00:11:56,621 --> 00:12:00,011
- and my dad... he basically hates me.
- you need to chill.

212
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:03,783
Take a xanax or a
tequila shot or something.

213
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:27,068
Hi. This is jenny humphrey.
I'm calling for scott smith.

214
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:30,523
Yeah, i know. I met with him yesterday.

215
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:32,197
Well, again, thank you for your time.

216
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:34,847
It's been a pleasure, dan.
Listen, do you like hockey?

217
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:37,847
Sure, yeah. I was thinking maybe
i could give you a business primer

218
00:12:37,848 --> 00:12:40,092
over a ranger game tuesday night.

219
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:41,751
What are you doing here?

220
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:44,263
I'm sorry, sir. I told
him you were in a meeting.

221
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,463
I came by to have robert clear
your schedule for the game.

222
00:12:47,546 --> 00:12:51,126
- apparently you already have a date.
- what are you doing here?

223
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:54,875
I'm newly interested in the
construction business. I thought...

224
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:57,675
i thought your dad
could show me the ropes.

225
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,734
I was just leaving. Thank you, mr. Bass.

226
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:09,920
$18 a flower? That's absurd.

227
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:12,416
Yeah, yeah, it, it is a bit steep.

228
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,480
Yeah. I'm an attorney,
and i'm telling you,

229
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:16,771
you're not paying for that peony.

230
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:21,011
You're paying for the
florist's madison avenue rent.

231
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:23,698
I am grace kelly. Grace kelly is me.

232
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,851
Blair, i would love

233
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:28,621
to fill this whole penthouse
with peonies for you

234
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:32,708
for your birthday, but would you
allow me to buy them someplace else?

235
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:34,524
I mean, it's the principle of the thing.

236
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:36,732
I prefer to get my own
peonies from my own florist,

237
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,849
but thank you so much.

238
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,938
Eleanor, over dinner,

239
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:44,717
you mentioned your
fondness for cyndi lauper.

240
00:13:44,718 --> 00:13:46,522
Mom and i love cyndi lauper.

241
00:13:46,523 --> 00:13:48,905
We used to re-enact "girls
just want to have fun."

242
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:51,390
Our first dvd was "vibes."

243
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,044
I got tickets to see
cyndi lauper at joe's pub

244
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,557
tomorrow night, and that
way, your mother and i

245
00:13:58,558 --> 00:14:02,077
- will be out of your hair for the party.
- my mother's coming to my party.

246
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:05,842
- what? You never want me at your parties.
- this year is different.

247
00:14:05,843 --> 00:14:08,392
I'm 18, and it's a grown-up party.

248
00:14:08,393 --> 00:14:10,478
I e-mailed dorota a new guest list.

249
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:12,703
- parents are invited.
- we'll return the tickets.

250
00:14:12,704 --> 00:14:15,149
No, nonsense, nonsense.
Blair and i will celebrate

251
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,021
her birthday on her
real birthday next week.

252
00:14:18,022 --> 00:14:21,287
We are going to see cyndi lauper!

253
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:26,785
Thank you so much for
giving me another chance.

254
00:14:26,786 --> 00:14:29,204
My, ex-partner had some issues,

255
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,165
so i've completely severed all
ties with her. I'm glad to hear it.

256
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,063
I'd be delighted to work
with you alone.

257
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:39,997
Really? That's amazing. I'm sure we can get
started on the incorporation right away.

258
00:14:39,998 --> 00:14:43,078
- you are 18, aren't you?
- actually, no, i'm 15.

259
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,348
- that's not a problem, though, is it?
- no, not at all.

260
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:47,270
We just have to get the
papers signed by a parent,

261
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:49,995
but that's simple, and
then we're good to go.

262
00:14:49,996 --> 00:14:52,541
Awesome. Yeah, no problem.

263
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:57,870
You can stand right here.

264
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,092
- thank you.
- you're welcome.

265
00:15:06,093 --> 00:15:10,448
So... tell me, when you're ready.

266
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:12,630
I've been practicing my poses.

267
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:15,278
Okay, zoolander. Just give me a second.

268
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,647
So what is it that you want? You
want, like, a little bit of this?

269
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:23,046
Or, like, you know, some
of this? I don't know.

270
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:27,080
How about, how about a little less?

271
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:30,592
You know, try being
still. Try... nothing.

272
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:35,874
You can try that.

273
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:42,506
You can't hide your
face. That's no good.

274
00:15:42,654 --> 00:15:44,581
I don't know what to do.

275
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:47,207
Can you say something?

276
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:50,389
Okay, okay. Put your head up here.

277
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,369
Put your feet up. Really enjoy yourself.

278
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:56,237
Okay. There you go. Look over here.

279
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:11,140
- that's too close. Get outta here.
- it's not too close.

280
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:34,092
I never thought i'd hear from you again.

281
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,693
Frankly, neither did i.
Are you still an intern

282
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,497
- at "new york magazine"?
- yeah. Why?

283
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,780
What do you know about
a guy named dan humphrey?

284
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:44,538
Nothing, except he's about to
walk into a meeting with my boss.

285
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:46,490
I have to go. I'll call you back.

286
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:48,695
Did brooklyn boy really think

287
00:16:48,696 --> 00:16:52,880
he could bury the bone in the
backyard and no one would find it?

288
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:55,823
Every bass will have his day.

289
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,013
Now how many muses come over in
the morning bearing breakfast?

290
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:14,494
Oh, my gosh. You must have
stayed up all night making that.

291
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,255
Pretty much.

292
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:18,479
What do you think?

293
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,809
It's beautiful.

294
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:23,509
It's also kind of weird, maybe.

295
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,268
Not that it's weird,
but it makes me feel that way,

296
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:29,656
you know, seeing myself...

297
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:32,109
like this.

298
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,905
I should probably be more cool
and mysterious and stop talking.

299
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:47,284
I kinda like being your inspiration.

300
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:49,412
Good. Get used to it.

301
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:54,978
- am i early?
- no, actually, you're right on time.

302
00:17:54,979 --> 00:17:57,527
Serena, this is danielle.
She models for me.

303
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:59,839
I thought modeling was our thing.

304
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,241
I'm doing a series.

305
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:05,750
I should go.

306
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,279
- no, you don't have to.
- yeah. No, i do.

307
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,060
I have this thing that i forgot about

308
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:14,824
- that i, i'm gonna do.
- oh, can i have this coffee?

309
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:17,309
Yes, yes. Have... have the coffee.

310
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,532
Noah, it's dan.

311
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:30,373
You know how i told you it might take a
while to get anything good on bass?

312
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:34,435
Turns out the story's not gonna take
as long to crack as we thought.

313
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:40,120
You have glow, miss eleanor,
like chinese lantern.

314
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:44,514
It's love, dorota.

315
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:48,895
How can you possibly love cyrus?
He does all the things you hate.

316
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:51,383
He uses the wrong fork.
He slurps his soup.

317
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:54,537
He wears sports socks.
He's short and pushy.

318
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:58,259
- he's nothing like daddy.
- which is precisely why i like him.

319
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,826
Harold was lovely in a million ways,

320
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:04,429
but he... he had his secrets.

321
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,893
Cyrus is someone i can trust.
Before i go see cyndi lauper,

322
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:11,135
i have to go pick up
my dress at barneys.

323
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:13,471
I have to get my hair done.
Would you like to come with?

324
00:19:13,472 --> 00:19:16,445
No, thanks. But have fun.

325
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:25,222
- screw grace kelly. I need to scheme.
- oh, no.

326
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:28,722
That tiny man must have some
big secret i can exploit,

327
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:31,456
and with his trusting nature,
finding it out shouldn't be too hard.

328
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:37,635
You're humphrey?
I wasn't expecting a kid.

329
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,415
I'm sorry to disappoint,
but no one else is showing up.

330
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,884
So if you got information,
i'm right here.

331
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,820
All right, in '87, your friend bass

332
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:49,824
bought a building in
midtown to convert to condos.

333
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:52,825
The market crashed, and he couldn't
raise the funds to complete it.

334
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:54,971
So wouldn't you know?
That building burned down.

335
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,566
- are you saying it wasn't an accident?
- kinberg building.

336
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,535
Bass collects the insurance.

337
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:01,906
He goes on to build an empire.

338
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:04,545
It was just like in "all
the president's men."

339
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:06,497
Yeah, and i'm thinking there's
no way this could be legit,

340
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,577
but all of the facts check
out... the date, the building,

341
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:12,235
the fire, the insurance, even.

342
00:20:12,236 --> 00:20:15,861
- and you're happy about this?
- it's huge.

343
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:18,384
An arsonist? This
article could change my life.

344
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:21,663
It could also change serena's life,
lily's life, their whole family's.

345
00:20:21,664 --> 00:20:24,384
I know, all right? And
i feel badly about that, but

346
00:20:24,385 --> 00:20:27,146
if this is true, then
people have the right to know.

347
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:29,247
Noah says all i need now is for
me to get a statement from bart.

348
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:31,894
By tricking him into telling you
information so you can exploit it.

349
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:35,275
Dad, i'm writing an important
story for a quality publication.

350
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,880
Why can't you just admit
this is a good thing for me?

351
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:44,277
Hello, alison.

352
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:47,624
Jenny asked you to sign what papers?

353
00:20:47,758 --> 00:20:51,052
All right, thanks for having my
back on this. Talk to you later.

354
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:53,480
You and i are gonna talk more.

355
00:20:53,481 --> 00:20:56,105
Now i have to go find jenny.

356
00:21:01,672 --> 00:21:05,635
My mom is so happy. I've
never seen her like this.

357
00:21:06,342 --> 00:21:09,240
Your mother is a diamond

358
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,127
in an ocean of coal.

359
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:17,458
From the moment we met,
i knew she was the one.

360
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:19,982
Have you always been so romantic?

361
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:22,564
Like, with your ex-wife?

362
00:21:22,565 --> 00:21:24,509
Certainly not.

363
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,144
Actually, i've only felt like
this once before in my life.

364
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:32,998
Tell me about it.

365
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,265
You know, alice and i were
very young when we got married.

366
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:43,014
We were very fond of each
other but never passionate.

367
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:46,032
And then i got drafted.
I was sent to vietnam.

368
00:21:46,033 --> 00:21:48,534
And i fell deeply in love with a

369
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:53,591
vietnamese girl named kim-ly.
It means "golden lion."

370
00:21:53,673 --> 00:21:55,600
How feline.

371
00:21:56,172 --> 00:21:57,471
Go on.

372
00:21:57,472 --> 00:21:59,688
I knew i could never
stay married to alice

373
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:02,885
if i could feel a passion
like that for somebody else.

374
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:06,406
And i planned to bring
kim-ly back to america.

375
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:10,578
But first, i had to go
back by myself and...

376
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,738
end my marriage.

377
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:16,160
While i was breaking the news to alice,

378
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:18,949
kim-ly was killed

379
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,805
in a surprise attack on her village.

380
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:25,330
- she died?
- yeah.

381
00:22:27,615 --> 00:22:30,308
So i was devastated.

382
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,392
But i always knew in my heart

383
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:36,381
that what i'd felt for
kim-ly was true love.

384
00:22:36,382 --> 00:22:39,190
And i think i was too much of a romantic

385
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,246
to stay forever in a loveless marriage.

386
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:46,589
So ultimately, alice and
i parted as good friends.

387
00:22:47,796 --> 00:22:51,896
I'd always hoped i could feel
something like that again,

388
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,569
and now i have with your mother.

389
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:58,895
Yeah. My prayers have been answered.

390
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:03,624
Aaron. Hey, it's me.

391
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,487
- what's up?
- it's such a beautiful day,

392
00:23:06,488 --> 00:23:09,827
i was thinking i could take you to
one of my favorite spots for a change.

393
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:12,602
Have you ever been to the old
puppet theatre in central park?

394
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:15,415
That sounds great, but i'm still
in the studio with danielle.

395
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:19,675
- i'm sorry. Are you still working?
- no, no. We're just hangin'.

396
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:22,875
Can, we do the puppet thing tomorrow?

397
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,737
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

398
00:23:26,161 --> 00:23:29,113
Looks like b.'s prophecy came true.

399
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:33,050
One day you're a muse.
The next, you're old news.

400
00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:37,650
The caterers done setting up downstairs?

401
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:39,045
Yes.

402
00:23:39,403 --> 00:23:42,465
And what about you, my sneaky daughter?

403
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:44,451
Are you done yet?

404
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,102
What do you mean?

405
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,239
Cyrus told me that you had lunch
together, and he was very touched.

406
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,841
Of course, he doesn't know yet that you
have an agenda for absolutely everything.

407
00:23:59,242 --> 00:24:01,661
I don't know what you're talking about.

408
00:24:03,928 --> 00:24:07,854
You're not a child anymore.
But you can't help it, can you?

409
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:11,804
You can't stop meddling and
scheming. Let me guess...

410
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:14,275
you played nice

411
00:24:14,276 --> 00:24:17,121
so that you could dig
up some dirt on cyrus.

412
00:24:17,477 --> 00:24:19,677
But it didn't work, did it?

413
00:24:19,678 --> 00:24:23,531
Because he is the most
upstanding man i have ever met.

414
00:24:27,785 --> 00:24:29,821
Sorry, mom.

415
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:33,115
It turns out that cyrus
is just like daddy.

416
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:37,165
He cheated on his
ex-wife. He had an affair.

417
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:39,116
He fell in love with her.

418
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,842
I'm sorry.

419
00:24:42,797 --> 00:24:46,017
It's true. You can ask him yourself.

420
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:57,680
Yeah?

421
00:24:57,681 --> 00:25:00,539
This is scott smith's office
calling for jenny humphrey.

422
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,128
This is agnes andrews.

423
00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:04,940
Oh, i'm sorry. I must have
mixed up your phone numbers.

424
00:25:04,952 --> 00:25:07,788
I'm about to see jenny right now. Is
there something you want me to tell her?

425
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:11,687
Yes, please let her know the contracts
are ready for j. Humphrey designs.

426
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:14,757
- i'll give her that message.
- Thank you.

427
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:31,871
There's a totally cute
guy over there. The busboy?

428
00:25:31,872 --> 00:25:34,429
Beggars can't be choosers.

429
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,933
How's your totally
cute boyfriend, serena?

430
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:40,662
- he's not exactly my boyfriend.
- you mean he's free?

431
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:43,928
Hazel, i can hear your
desperation from the other room.

432
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:46,183
Serena, what's wrong?

433
00:25:48,628 --> 00:25:53,261
I think you were right. The whole
muse thing kinda backfired.

434
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:57,039
I would say i told you so, but
since i'm now 18, i'll refrain.

435
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,613
- what happened?
- we had this amazing night.

436
00:26:00,614 --> 00:26:03,880
I modeled for him, and he did
this incredible installation.

437
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:06,281
He totally loves you.

438
00:26:06,473 --> 00:26:09,226
But then another girl
showed up at the studio,

439
00:26:09,227 --> 00:26:13,283
and she modeled for him, and
they've been hanging out all day.

440
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:17,017
So pablo's already moved on?
That was faster than i thought.

441
00:26:17,018 --> 00:26:20,910
It's okay, s. It's
actually a good thing.

442
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:23,429
This way, you can get out
before you're in too far.

443
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,913
You just missed your dad.

444
00:26:28,914 --> 00:26:31,412
- he was ringing the buzzer for an hour.
- my dad?

445
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:33,257
Wait, what are you
doing with my dresses?

446
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,435
When i let you in, i had no
idea you'd be such a little thief...

447
00:26:36,436 --> 00:26:39,365
stealing my contact list
and our whole business.

448
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:41,390
- i wasn't stealing, agnes...
- you know, you think you're so

449
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,658
- talented and unique, don't you?
- no, i don't.

450
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:49,276
Three weeks ago, you were absolutely nothing.
You were a little intern pinning my hem.

451
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:53,450
It was my idea to do the fashion line.
I found the photographer and the models

452
00:26:53,451 --> 00:26:55,714
for the fashion shoot.
It was also my idea

453
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:58,096
for the guerilla fashion show,
and i have all the contacts!

454
00:26:58,097 --> 00:27:00,254
I know. You're right,
okay? You're right.

455
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:02,137
Just give me my dresses, please.

456
00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:06,357
Do you know how many "talented" artists there
are living in brooklyn designing dresses?

457
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,983
Agnes, give me my dresses!
What are you doing?!

458
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:11,375
These dresses are as much
mine as they are yours.

459
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:15,222
- now they belong to nobody.
- are you totally insane?

460
00:27:15,223 --> 00:27:17,573
Yes, i'm insane, jenny!

461
00:27:20,711 --> 00:27:23,526
What are you doing? Agnes? Don't!

462
00:27:23,527 --> 00:27:25,467
Agnes, please!

463
00:27:25,468 --> 00:27:28,950
These dresses are everything!
They're my entire future!

464
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,119
You are out of your mind!

465
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:35,590
What the hell did you do, agnes?!

466
00:27:35,591 --> 00:27:37,941
You did this! Now by
the time i get back,

467
00:27:37,942 --> 00:27:40,388
i want you and your
crap out of my apartment.

468
00:27:48,315 --> 00:27:50,639
It was good to see you.

469
00:27:52,264 --> 00:27:54,396
The mythical serena.

470
00:27:54,397 --> 00:27:56,379
You must be cyrus,

471
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,205
eleanor's boyfriend. How
did you know who i was?

472
00:27:59,206 --> 00:28:01,871
Well, i recognized you
from aaron's studio.

473
00:28:02,004 --> 00:28:03,931
You know aaron?

474
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:06,778
- he's my son!
- wh...

475
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:08,980
oh, my goodness.

476
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:12,192
You didn't catch the family resemblance?

477
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:15,958
No, it's okay.

478
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:18,883
You know, i think he's
quite smitten with you.

479
00:28:18,884 --> 00:28:21,747
Really? I'm not so sure.

480
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:25,261
He told me that he
took you to the cloisters.

481
00:28:25,262 --> 00:28:28,391
He definitely doesn't
do that with just anyone.

482
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:31,659
I'm actually
gonna go stop by his studio

483
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,427
to see him now, but it was
really nice meeting you.

484
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:36,139
Likewise.

485
00:28:38,823 --> 00:28:42,445
- oh, eleanor.
- did yo cheat on your ex-wife?

486
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:48,436
- well, did you? Is it true?
- yes, it is.

487
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:50,086
Get out.

488
00:28:59,762 --> 00:29:02,116
I thought he was...

489
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:03,803
different.

490
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:08,125
I have to go lie down.

491
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,907
- there are so many hot guys here.
- my god. Look at that guy.

492
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:15,928
Cyndi lauper?

493
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:18,626
What are you doing here?

494
00:29:18,627 --> 00:29:21,769
My pal cyrus called me yesterday.

495
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:25,960
He bought out my gig and asked me to
play this girl's birthday party insad.

496
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:28,757
I guess he's madly in
love with her mother.

497
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:31,614
I'm looking for a blair waldorf.

498
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,715
How do you do?

499
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,819
Make yourself at home.

500
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,561
Dorota!

501
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:47,820
This is dorota. She's your biggest fan.

502
00:29:47,864 --> 00:29:50,503
Oh, my. Miss lauper!

503
00:29:50,504 --> 00:29:52,845
Wait! Miss blair, where are you going?

504
00:29:52,846 --> 00:29:56,727
I wanted a harry winston choker for my
birthday. Instead, i got a conscience.

505
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,644
I gotta go.

506
00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:03,798
Sorry to bother you at home, sir.

507
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,895
What was it you wanted
to speak to me about?

508
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,383
Something kind of strange happened
while i was at your office.

509
00:30:10,384 --> 00:30:13,608
I overheard this guy talking
about you to an employee.

510
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:16,848
He said that you
were responsible for a fire

511
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:20,341
in one of your own buildings.
He had a lot of details.

512
00:30:20,342 --> 00:30:22,924
I figured there must be
some kind of explanation,

513
00:30:22,925 --> 00:30:25,756
if it even happened,
which, i'm sure it didn't.

514
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,129
And look, i know it's none
of my business. I'm sorry. But

515
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,768
he was so insistent, i figured if
he was telling people at work, he...

516
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:33,886
he could be telling other people, too.

517
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:36,021
So it's out.

518
00:30:36,682 --> 00:30:40,495
I've had that man's death on
my conscience for 20 years.

519
00:30:40,496 --> 00:30:42,585
Wait. Someone died?

520
00:30:42,586 --> 00:30:44,904
Dad, don't say anything else.

521
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:48,318
He's writing a story for a magazine.

522
00:30:53,994 --> 00:30:57,315
So what's it gonna cost
to make this go away?

523
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:02,547
I don't want your money.

524
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:22,230
If you use this against my
father, i will destroy you.

525
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:24,864
Chuck, what happened is
bigger than you hating me

526
00:31:24,865 --> 00:31:27,215
or me trying to make it as a writer.

527
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:29,551
I couldn't ignore this if i wanted to.

528
00:31:29,552 --> 00:31:32,558
It will ruin our family.

529
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:35,406
Don't do it.

530
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:37,346
Please.

531
00:31:46,435 --> 00:31:48,499
You're still here.

532
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:51,602
I sent my driver to
dinner because i thought

533
00:31:51,603 --> 00:31:54,445
i'd be at the party
ringing in your birthday.

534
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:58,516
You threw in the towel rather easily.
I expected a harder fight.

535
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:02,753
I'm smart enough to know
that getting into a war

536
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,685
with eleanor's daughter
is never gonna result in a victory.

537
00:32:06,686 --> 00:32:08,995
So you retreated with dignity.

538
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:10,752
Who says i gave up?

539
00:32:12,661 --> 00:32:16,228
Oh, my god. You outmaneuvered me.

540
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:19,842
You deliberately let me
win, counting on the fact

541
00:32:19,843 --> 00:32:22,286
that cyndi lauper would
prey on my emotions.

542
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:26,216
I'm a lawyer. I do
think a few moves ahead.

543
00:32:27,064 --> 00:32:31,219
Some of us can't rely entirely
on our looks, you know.

544
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,051
Well done.

545
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:36,036
- not enough.
- fine. You're a genius.

546
00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:38,930
You better be good to my mother,
or i'll be coming for you.

547
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:41,269
Those are fair terms.

548
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,749
Now come upstairs and stand next to me

549
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,948
while i tell my mom the whole
truth about the golden lion.

550
00:32:46,949 --> 00:32:50,706
She'll be furious with me,
so i may need an attorney.

551
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:57,095
You're not what i had in mind.

552
00:32:57,096 --> 00:33:00,005
Well, you're not what i had in mind.

553
00:33:11,129 --> 00:33:12,496
Sir?

554
00:33:12,668 --> 00:33:15,935
This was left for you with
the concierge downstairs.

555
00:33:50,643 --> 00:33:53,390
I'm sorry i'm interrupting your "work."

556
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:56,682
Serena, i thought i was
seeing you tomorrow. Excuse me.

557
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:59,313
Right, because you're
seeing danielle tonight.

558
00:33:59,314 --> 00:34:02,833
I'm seeing a lot of people. You and
i just started hanging out, okay?

559
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:05,510
Did i miss a talk where
we decided to be exclusive?

560
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,758
Look, i don't know how
it works in high school, but

561
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,765
i like to date more than one person at
once. You're free to see other people, too.

562
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:15,154
Thank you for the condescending
lecture, but that's not really my thing.

563
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:31,775
Hey, dad. Can i come in?

564
00:34:31,776 --> 00:34:34,932
Of course you can,
jenny. This is your home.

565
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:38,089
- i'm happy to have you back.
- i'm not back yet,

566
00:34:38,362 --> 00:34:40,753
but i will be if you sign these papers.

567
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,999
The papers your
mother already refused to sign?

568
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,014
She only refused because she
didn't want to get in the middle.

569
00:34:46,015 --> 00:34:47,903
And here i thought you'd
come to your senses.

570
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:50,035
You don't even have your coat off,
and you're already using

571
00:34:50,036 --> 00:34:53,691
- emotional blackmail to get your way.
- spin it however you like.

572
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:59,185
- if i sign this paper, it means that
- everything you've done up to now...

573
00:34:59,186 --> 00:35:02,855
this lying, cheating, manipulation...

574
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,609
it's all okay.

575
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:08,381
And if you don't sign it,
then everything i've done...

576
00:35:08,382 --> 00:35:11,586
everything... is all for nothing.

577
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:16,675
I won't put my name on a piece of
paper condoning who you've become.

578
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:23,046
Fine. Then i'll just
have to find another way.

579
00:35:23,047 --> 00:35:25,892
What other way? You gonna sleep
on agnes' couch till you turn 18?

580
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:27,734
If that's what it takes.

581
00:35:45,222 --> 00:35:47,575
Poor little orphan jenny.

582
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:50,054
Looks like she needs a daddy warbucks.

583
00:35:50,055 --> 00:35:52,959
But daddy warbucks
don't grow on trees...

584
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,882
at least not on a tree
that grows in brooklyn.

585
00:36:12,897 --> 00:36:15,575
Mr. Smith? Hi.

586
00:36:16,396 --> 00:36:19,307
Yeah, sorry to bother you on a sunday.

587
00:36:19,843 --> 00:36:22,931
Is there any way that we can
meet at your office today?

588
00:36:26,345 --> 00:36:28,108
Can i come in?

589
00:36:28,222 --> 00:36:30,035
I can't stop you.

590
00:36:40,056 --> 00:36:42,571
I want to apologize, son.

591
00:36:44,642 --> 00:36:46,610
Apologize?

592
00:36:46,611 --> 00:36:50,092
I never blamed you for
your mother's death.

593
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:54,739
I read that short story that,

594
00:36:54,986 --> 00:36:57,678
dan humphrey wrote about
you and your mother.

595
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:59,892
I had no idea you felt that way.

596
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:02,507
It's my fault.

597
00:37:07,718 --> 00:37:12,629
I know i've had trouble
being close to you.

598
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,125
But it's not for the reasons you think.

599
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,786
It's just hard because...

600
00:37:21,238 --> 00:37:23,711
every time i look at you,

601
00:37:23,712 --> 00:37:25,502
i see her.

602
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:33,452
- you miss her.
- you have no idea.

603
00:37:33,722 --> 00:37:37,576
I've made some terrible mistakes in my
life but i don't want to make another.

604
00:37:40,848 --> 00:37:42,994
I want to know my son.

605
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:50,310
So any, interest in
going to that hockey game?

606
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:56,306
I'll... clear my calendar.

607
00:38:03,064 --> 00:38:04,977
I spoke to your sister.

608
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:08,759
My, plan didn't exactly pan out.

609
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,705
I heard. She called me.

610
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:15,798
You've been thinking about
that story on bart bass?

611
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:17,425
Yeah.

612
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:20,786
- i took your advice and killed it.
- you saved that family.

613
00:38:23,723 --> 00:38:26,580
I think it's time you saved ours, dad.

614
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:29,193
It's so important to you to be right.

615
00:38:29,194 --> 00:38:31,441
That's a trait i inherited.
I'd be the first to say it.

616
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,818
But you... you need to get jenny back,

617
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:36,060
even if it means letting her win.

618
00:38:42,665 --> 00:38:45,275
So... what's the urgent question?

619
00:38:45,276 --> 00:38:47,262
Neither of my parents
will sign the papers.

620
00:38:47,263 --> 00:38:48,892
What else can i do?

621
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:52,238
You have one other
option, but it's extreme.

622
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:54,479
You could file a suit to
become emancipated.

623
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,834
What's that mean?

624
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:57,747
You'd be empowered to
be your own guardian.

625
00:38:57,748 --> 00:39:00,563
Your legal ties with your
family would be severed.

626
00:39:00,927 --> 00:39:03,109
You mean divorce my parents?

627
00:39:10,351 --> 00:39:13,155
Okay. What do i need to do?

628
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:15,785
I can't believe aaron is cyrus' son.

629
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:19,029
Of course, you get the prince,
and i get stuck with the toad.

630
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,269
It doesn't look like i'm gonna
have the fairy tale ending.

631
00:39:22,379 --> 00:39:24,432
I went to have a talk
with aaron yesterday.

632
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:27,396
- and?
- instead, he had a talk with me.

633
00:39:27,397 --> 00:39:29,541
I really tried to deal with
the casual dating thing...

634
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:31,428
but i guess it's just not for me.

635
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:34,497
Of course not, because beneath
that free spirit facade,

636
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:36,604
you're totally
conventional, just like i am.

637
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:40,989
It's not a facade. I believe in
freedom, people following their hearts,

638
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,992
doing what they want. You know i
always wish i'd lived in the '60s.

639
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:46,969
You believe in long hair,
peasant skirts and sandals,

640
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,062
but you in an open
relationship? I don't think so.

641
00:39:49,063 --> 00:39:52,440
Speaking of relationships, how are
you faring with cyrus and eleanor?

642
00:39:52,441 --> 00:39:56,546
He's not exactly my cup of tea,
but he makes my mother happy, and...

643
00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:59,818
- he's not that bad.
- i'm proud of you.

644
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:01,987
It's not like i have
to see him that often.

645
00:40:01,988 --> 00:40:04,830
He'll come to pick her up
for dinner once, twice a week.

646
00:40:06,352 --> 00:40:08,361
- have to go.
- bye.

647
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:12,482
Darling, we have some wonderful news.

648
00:40:12,672 --> 00:40:17,341
Thanks to you, blair, we've been
up all night talking about love

649
00:40:17,342 --> 00:40:20,703
and death and the brevity of life.

650
00:40:20,704 --> 00:40:24,175
And we have decided that
he should move in today.

651
00:40:24,176 --> 00:40:28,470
Some surprises hit you over
the head like a squash racket.

652
00:40:28,924 --> 00:40:32,527
And others sneak up on you
when you're least expecting it.

653
00:40:32,528 --> 00:40:34,006
What are you doing here?

654
00:40:34,007 --> 00:40:37,510
I'm picking you up for an afternoon
of puppet theater in the park.

655
00:40:37,511 --> 00:40:40,544
But we broke up last night, remember?

656
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:43,665
Wait, how did... how did we
break up if we're not going out?

657
00:40:43,763 --> 00:40:47,263
Thanks for reminding
me. That feels good.

658
00:40:49,026 --> 00:40:51,403
Serena, i really like you.

659
00:40:51,404 --> 00:40:53,465
Even though i grew up
on the upper east side,

660
00:40:53,466 --> 00:40:56,262
i don't want the same
life that my parents had...

661
00:40:56,473 --> 00:41:00,068
social obligations and
forced conversations,

662
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,465
saying no to all the things
that i wanted to say yes to.

663
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:07,289
I thought you felt the same way.

664
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,034
And if i was wrong, i apologize.

665
00:41:11,658 --> 00:41:13,339
No.

666
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,421
No, you were right.

667
00:41:17,952 --> 00:41:21,341
Wait. What are you doing?
Don't you want to get dressed?

668
00:41:21,342 --> 00:41:22,650
Nope.

669
00:41:22,651 --> 00:41:26,860
And sometimes the biggest surprises
are the ones you spring on yourself.

670
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:28,409
Come on.

671
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:35,744
Scampering about in a slip
is one way to shed old skin.

672
00:41:35,887 --> 00:41:41,259
But will embracing free love be as easy
as flinging off a pair of fendi flats?

673
00:41:41,452 --> 00:41:45,210
Looks like someone's
going barefoot in the park.

674
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:48,441
X.o.x.o., gossip girl.
