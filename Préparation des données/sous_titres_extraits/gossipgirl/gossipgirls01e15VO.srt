I Got Three Cases Of Champagne
For Serena Van Der Woodsen.

00:00:08,624 --> 00:00:09,739
For Me?
Who's It From?

5
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:13,195
Porn And Handcuffs? This Is Low,
Chuck, Even For You.

6
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:16,670
What's This? Chuck Said It Came For
You This Morning. Whoa. Is That Coke?

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,883
How Do You Like A Brother
Who Uses You As A Drug Mule?

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,720
I Can't Believe You Think Chuck Is
Doing These Things. What's He Done Now?

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,180
I'll Tell You What He's Done. If
We're Gonna Exist Under The Same Roof,

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,050
I Am Laying Down Some House Rules. No
Need, Princess. Bart Already Kicked Me Out.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,780
I'm Moving Back To My Suite.
I Love You, Nate Archibald.

12

Always Have, Always Will.

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,850
I Want Nothing Else To Do
With You, Blair. It's Over.

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,980
Jenny, If You Walk Away
From Me Now, I Will Ruin You.

15
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,580
How Are You Gonna Do That? My
Mother's Valentino Was Stolen.

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,050
Oh, My God. That's My Mother's Dress. Do You
Think That You Can Just Send Me Off To School

17
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,050
With A Plaid Skirt
And A Metrocard,

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,850
And Everything Will Be Okay?
I'm Really Sorry, Chuck.

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,020
I Know It Wasn't You
Who Sent Me That Stuff.

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,191
Just Doing What I Was Told.
Time's Up.

56
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:30,222
I Was Instructed
That Whenever Time Was Up,

57
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:33,175
I Should Share That Information. Yes, But The
Manner In Which You Went About It-It Was Like

58
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:35,905
You Were Deliberately Trying
To Humiliate Me. How Bad?

59
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:40,644
Uh... Half. I Finished Exactly
Half In The Allotted Time.

60
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:42,800
Well, You're A Smart Kid.
I'm A Choker. I Choke.

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,816
Mm, Just In Your Head. T
- Ball. First Grade. Remember This?

62
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:48,156
Bases Loaded, And I
Struck Out. You Were 6.

63
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:50,416
The Ball Was On A Tee, Not
Moving. You'll Come Through.

64
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:53,216
You're Basing That
On What, Exactly?

65
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,216
Blind Faith?

66
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:57,863
Bye.
Wait.

67
00:02:57,863 --> 00:02:59,613
Dad, I'm Gonna Be Late.
I'm Coming With You.

68
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,999
<I>What? You're Walking Me To
School? I Need The Exercise.</I>

69
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:03,487
I Made One Mistake.
It Doesn't Mean I Need

70
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:05,999
A Human Ankle Monitor. You Used
To Beg Me To Walk You To School.

71
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:08,925
You'd Cry If I Didn't Walk You To
Class. That Wasn't Me. That Was Dan.

72
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:09,988
It's True, But I Was 6,

73
00:03:09,988 --> 00:03:13,787
And It An Emotional Time For Me. It Was
Post-T-Ball. Jenny, What You Did Was Wrong

74
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:15,050
And Really Out Of Character.

75
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,738
Grounding You Is Not
Just About Punishment.

76
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,708
We Need To Spend Some Time Together,
Reconnect. Yeah, I Want That, Too.

77
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:24,488
Just... Not In Public
And In Front Of My Friends.

78
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,237
All Right.
Tonight. Dinner.

79
00:03:27,237 --> 00:03:29,125
Okay.

Hey, Jen, You Wanna Wait Up For
A Second? We Could Take The-

2200. Fair.

86
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:47,333
It's 90th Percentile.

87
00:03:47,363 --> 00:03:49,988
Which Means Nelly Yuki
Probably Got 2300.

88
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:52,333
And You Don't Even Talk To Her.
Why Do You Care How She Does?

89
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:55,238
Nelly Yuki Has Her Sights
Set On Yale, Too.

90
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:55,833

Extracurriculars?

93
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:02,203
I Need To Kick
Her Well-Rounded Ass.

94
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:05,663
And They Say You've Lost Your
Edge. Nelly Yuki Must Be Destroyed.

95
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,833
Why Do You Keep Saying Her
Name? Because It's Nelly Yuki.

96
00:04:08,863 --> 00:04:11,550
Ew, Gross. Incoming-Chuck.
You Ready?

97
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,550
No, I Gotta Wait For Dan.
He's Pretty Stressed.

98
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,316
He Doesn't Do Well With Tests,
So... Performance Anxiety?

Bye, Blair.

100
00:04:23,403 --> 00:04:25,675

Oh, Chuck, I Had No Idea
You Felt That Way About Me.

Yeah, I-I've Been A Little
Overwhelmed Myself Lately.

160
00:06:57,566 --> 00:07:00,675
Well, You Wanna Hang Out...
Study?

161
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:02,933
Mmm. Ooh. I Wanna Take
Whatever S.A.T. Prep Course

162
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:04,316
<I>You're Signed Up For.</I>

163
00:07:04,316 --> 00:07:06,175
Well, It's Not Too Late.

164
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,378
Okay. I'm In, Then.

165
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:09,800
I'll See You.

166
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:16,222
You Always Did Know
How To Leave 'Em Wanting More.

167
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:21,104
Oh, My God, Georgina.

168
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,481
What Are You Doing Here?
Well, I Told You I Was Coming.

169
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:34,999
Didn't You Get My Gifts? Uh, You're Supposed
To Be In Switzerland Dating A Prince.

170
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:37,050
Luckily Daddy Didn't
Need The G5.

171
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,628
Haven't You Missed Me?

172
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,888
How Could I Not?

173
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,987
Okay. You Don't Want
To Throw Me A Homecoming Party.

174
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:45,999
I Get It,
But Let's Have A Cocktail,

175
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:46,999
Catch Up.

176
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:52,300
S., You're Really Gonna
Hurt My Feelings,

177
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,925
And You Know How I Get
When My Feelings Are Hurt.

178
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,425
Great.
I'll See You Tonight.

179
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:05,458
It's So Weird Seeing You.
It's Almost Like I Never Left.

180
00:08:09,812 --> 00:08:11,128
<I>Spotted In The Courtyard-</I>

181
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:13,503
<I>Serena Looking Like
She's Seen A Ghost-</I>

182
00:08:13,503 --> 00:08:16,175
<I>The Ghost Of Parties Past.</I>

183
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:25,675
Jenny, Why Did You Want To Meet
Here? Well, I've Been Thinking-

184
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:27,738
What's The One Thing
That No One In Our Group Has,

185
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:30,863
I Mean, Not Even Blair?
Compassion?

186
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:33,737
No, A Boyfriend. You Know,
If I'm Gonna Make It To Queen,

187
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:36,237
I Need A King. Queen Elizabeth
Never Had A Boyfriend.

188
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:37,800
But She Only Had
The Spanish To Conquer,

189
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,300
And I Have Blair Waldorf.
Let's Talk Qualifications.

190
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,675
He Has To Be Cute,
But Not Full Of Himself.

191
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:46,831
He Has To Be From
The Right Kind Of Family...

192
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,613
Ugh, But Not Disgusting.

193
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:54,550
Come On.

194
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,237
I'm So Sorry.
Are You Okay?

195
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:04,113
Yeah, Uh,
My Lunch Isn't, Though.

196
00:09:04,113 --> 00:09:05,987
Oh, Linus.

197
00:09:05,987 --> 00:09:10,487
Let Me Give You...
My Last Dollar.

198
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:12,441
Oh, I Couldn't.

199
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:14,941
You Shouldn't Be Walking
The Streets With No Money.

200
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:17,050
Let's Just Settle
For An I.O.U. Then.

201
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,550
It's Just A Hot Dog.

202
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,987
That Was Just My Excuse
To Give This To You.

203
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:23,613
Here's My Number.

204
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,863
Thank You.

205
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,488
I Mean, It's Fine.

206
00:09:28,488 --> 00:09:29,999
I Mean, I'm Really
Not Even That Hungry.

207
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:32,175
Well,
If You Change Your Mind...

208
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:42,956
What Are You Doing?
He's Gorgeous.

209
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:43,999
He's A Dog Walker.

210
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:47,011
I Need A King, Not A Jester.

211
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,691
Come On.
Let's Go Lurk Outside Dalton.

212
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,363
Hey.
Vanessa.

213
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:01,362
You're Nate, Right? You Play
A Very Small But Crucial Role

214
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:02,999
In My Video Project.
Oh, That's Right.

215
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:06,112
I Remember You Following Dan Around
With Your Video Camera. Hey, Nate.

216
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:08,972
What Are You Doing Here? I Mean,
I Know The Coffee's Good...

217
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:10,999
Since I've Taken Every
S.A.T. Prep And Review Class

218
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:14,613
In The Five Boroughs, I Figured Why Not
Pay It Forward? So-So You Don't Need These?

219
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:15,999
You Know, I've Actually
Already Taken It.

220
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:17,969
My Parents Don't Want Me
Going To U.S.C.,

221
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:19,253
So I Had To Make Sure
My Scores Were Good Enough

222
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:21,941
To Get In Without Their Help,
Which, Thanks To These Books,

223
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:26,722
They Were, So I'm Done. While We All Love
Hearing About The Struggles Of The Idle Rich,

224
00:10:26,722 --> 00:10:28,909
Dan's Got
A Fine Tutor Right Here.

225
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:30,675
I Ace
Every Practice Test I Take,

226
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:34,550
So We Don't Need Your Hand-Me-Downs. Um, You
Know What? Th-This Is Actually Pretty Good.

227
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,300
This Looks Good. Thank You.
Is There A Reason You Insist

228
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,862
On Looking So Desperate And Needy?
She's Been Like That Since We Were Kids-

229
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:42,190
Venomous Without Provocation. It's
Better Than Being A Charity Case.

230
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,378
She's Rude, Too.
I See That.

231
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:47,347
Yeah.
Well, I Gotta Get Going,

232
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,737
But I Hope These Are Useful.

233
00:10:48,737 --> 00:10:50,750
Oh, Yeah, Yeah, Very.
Thank You.

234
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,409
What?

235
00:10:55,563 --> 00:10:57,800
They're-Hey,
Every Little Bit Helps.

236
00:11:15,438 --> 00:11:17,550
Is This Really
The Best Place For Us To Talk?

237
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,487
You Of All People Know

238
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:20,816
Nothing Gets Me Talking
Like A Cosmo.

239
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,050
A Lot Has Changed Since
We Used To Hang Out, Georgie.

240
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,363
I Know. I Get It. No, You Don't
Get It, Or You Wouldn't Have Sent Me

241
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:34,675
All Those So-Called Gifts
In The First Place.

242
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:36,953
Oh, Come On, Sweetie.
Those Were Funny.

243
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,238
Get Over Yourself. I Was Just
Trying To Make You Laugh.

244
00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:42,175
How About This-
How About For One Night,

245
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:44,503
We Hang Out Like Old Times,
But Unlike Old Times,

246
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,425
I Won't Get Out Of Control,
Unless You Want Me To.

247
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:48,613
I Mean,
I Can Totally Get Out-

248
00:11:48,613 --> 00:11:50,282
No, Okay. I-I Won't
Get Out Of Control,

249
00:11:50,312 --> 00:11:51,847
And I Totally Respect That.

250
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:54,207
Please Stop Me Any Time You
Feel Like Answering.

251
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:57,441
Any... Time. Come On.

252
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:05,206
One Drink, But Only One.

253
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:07,000
Cheers.

254
00:12:13,454 --> 00:12:14,766
Where Are All The Tutors?

255
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:17,188
And The Masseuses?
And The Smoothies?

256
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:18,999
All That I Have Promised You
Is Waiting.

257
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,597
And While It Gives Me
Great Pleasure

258
00:12:20,597 --> 00:12:23,300
To Think Of Us Crossing That
S.A.T. Finish Line Together,

259
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,566
Before The Race Can Begin,

260
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:27,112
You Need To Be Made Aware
Of One Little Thing.

261
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:32,750
Nelly Yuki,
Top In Our Class,

262
00:12:32,862 --> 00:12:33,750
Summer Schooled
At The Sorbonne.

263
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,625
Lots Of People Do Summer
At Sorbonne, Including Me.

264
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:40,409
True. Penelope, You May Be
A National Merit Scholar,

265
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:42,612
But Nelly Yuki
Is A Merit Scholar...

266
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:43,722
A Peabody Scholar

267
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,050
And An Intel Science
Talent Search Finalist.

268
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,112
Isabel,
You're A Concert Pianist,

269
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:52,675
But Itzhak Perlman Himself Gave
Nelly Her Very First Violin.

270
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:53,982
Hazel...

271
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:57,316
You're Just Along
For The Ride, 'Kay?

272
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:59,550
But If Any Of Us Wants
To Live Out Our College Dreams,

273
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,487
We Have To Find
Nelly Yuki's Weakness

274
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:02,612
And Exploit It.

275
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:08,629
So What's It Gonna Be-
Aromatherapy Or Annihilation?

276
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:12,766
What's The Plan?

277
00:13:23,346 --> 00:13:24,362
It Was, Like,
The Worst Thing Ever,

278
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:25,487
And Then-And Then,
Do You Remember?

279
00:13:25,487 --> 00:13:27,094
Do You Remember When
We Ran Out Of Money?

280
00:13:27,144 --> 00:13:29,222
And Then I Had
To Flash The Bartender

281
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:33,457
'Cause We Ran Out Of Money.
Wait, Wait. Oh, My God.

282
00:13:33,457 --> 00:13:36,879
Remember When We Were Savannah
And Svetlana? Oh, Savannah.

283
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,206
Savannah!

284
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:41,753
I Totally Forgot About
Savannah And Svetlana. Svetlana.

285
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:44,832
Wait, No, I Think We Were
Tiffany And Angel That Night.

286
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh, You Could Talk Me
Into Anything.

287
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,566
Hey, Ladies, Can I, Uh,
Get You Guys Another Round?

288
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:52,581
Ooh.
No, Thank You.

289
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:55,800
My American Girlfriend,

290
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,237
So Uptight.

291
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,628
<I>They Think The Drink
Lead To The Sex.</I>

292
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:01,999
No, No, No,
I Wasn't Being Rude.

293
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:03,675
I Just Didn't Want
To Take Anything

294
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:05,487
If I Couldn't Offer
Anything In Return.

295
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:07,988
We'd Be Happy
With Just One Dance.

296
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:10,988
Aw. Aw. I'm Afraid I Have Two Left Feet.

297
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:14,112
Aw, This Is What Is
The Practice For. Come On, Lady.

298
00:14:14,112 --> 00:14:15,800
<I>Opa!</I>

299
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:19,128
Who Is That?

300
00:14:19,128 --> 00:14:21,675
Um, No One.
Uh, Thank You For Calling Back.

301
00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:24,550
Ahh! Nadine The Beauty
Queen. How Can I Help You?

302
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,675
I Don't Have Time
For This.

303
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:27,440
Do You Want 1 Or 2 G's?

304
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:30,800
Can You Just Give It-
Some Dealer You Know?

305
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,425
I Didn't Realize
I Brought My Grandmother.

306
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:36,238
I Have To Go.

307
00:14:37,937 --> 00:14:39,999
Hey, Come Here.

308
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,242
Whoo!

309
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:47,742
<I>I'm So Stupid,
So, So, So, So Stupid.</I>

310
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:49,782
You Don't Sound Stupid.
You Sound Drunk.

311
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:51,782
<I>What Have You Been Into?</I>

312
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:53,282
Georgina.

313
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:56,282
Good News Is, She Doesn't Want
Anything Except To Party.

314
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,782
Bad News Is, I Partied.

315
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:01,942
Care To Paint A Picture?
Does This Party Require Clothes?

316
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:04,442
I'm Supposed To Be
At Dan's Studying.

317
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:06,442
I Called
To Tell Him I'd Be Late,

318
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:09,782
But Not This Late. I-I Just
Have To Call Him And Say-

319
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:11,782
That Instead
Of Studying With Him,

320
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:13,782
You're Out
With Your Old Pal Georgina.

321
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,925
No. I Don't Want Him
To Know She Exists.

322
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:18,050
My Mom, Blair,
Even You Can't Stand Her.

323
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,142
Dan Of All People
Cannot Know Georgie.

324
00:15:22,782 --> 00:15:24,742
Can You Help Me?

325
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:26,535
Say You Need Me.

326
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:27,394
Chuck!

327
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:30,142
Hearing You Scream My Name
Is More Than Enough.

328
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:33,342
I'll Take Care Of It
And Pick You Up In Ten.

329
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:40,982
Hey, I've Been Wondering Where You
Were. You Mean All Of Your Life?

330
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:43,175
Uh, Don't Take This
The Wrong Way, Serena,

331
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,512
But You Sound Just Like This Jackass
We Know. Serena Has Food Poisoning.

332
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:51,050
She's Too Sick To Come To Your
Playdate. Put Her On The Phone.

333
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,363
The Bathroom
Doesn't Get Reception.

334
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,675
Somehow I Don't Believe You. And I'd
Like To Say I'm A Little Glad About That,

335
00:15:57,675 --> 00:16:00,512
But My Poor, Sick Sister
Has Asked For My Assistance

336
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,253
In The Matter,
So I'll Leave It At This-

337
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,487
She's Not Coming.
Don't Try Calling.

338
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:07,440
Humphrey,
Always A Pleasure.

339
00:16:22,736 --> 00:16:25,165
I'm Gonna Have To Call You Back. Hey.

340
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:29,550
Beautiful Day You're Ruining, Isn't It? Do
Me A Favor, Please, And Leave Serena Alone.

341
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,065
<I>It Was Serena
I Was Doing A Favor For.</I>

342
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:33,065
All I Know Is
Before Spring Break,

343
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:34,613
Everything Was Great.
It Was Good.

344
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:36,238
Now Break's Over,
She's Not Quite Herself,

345
00:16:36,238 --> 00:16:39,643
And I'm-I'm Trying To Think,
What Has Changed In Her Life?

346
00:16:39,643 --> 00:16:42,316
Oh, The Bass Family
Moved Into It.

347
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:43,143
Dan, Hi.

348
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:47,050
Hey.
Hey, How You Feeling?

349
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,675
Good. My Migraine's Gone.

350
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:52,300
Migraine? I Thought
You Had Food Poisoning.

351
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,675
Yeah, That Came After.

352
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:56,956
What Exactly Happened
Last Night?

353
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:58,488
I Already Told Him.

354
00:16:58,488 --> 00:17:00,488
<I>I'm Asking You.</I>

355
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,562
Well, I Got Food Poisoning,
And Then Chuck Helped Me Out.

356
00:17:04,612 --> 00:17:05,800
Okay,
Where Exactly Did You Eat

357
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,707
That You Got This Killer Food Poisoning
Migraine? Can We Drop The Interrogation?

358
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:13,237
As Soon As You Tell Me Where My
Girlfriend Is. I'm Right Here With You.

359
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,238
Look,
I- I Gotta Go To Class.

360
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,753
I Can't-
I Can't Do This.

361
00:17:24,906 --> 00:17:26,703
This Is Exactly Why
I Didn't Want Her To Come Back.

362
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:29,737
She's Been Back A Day Already
And Look What's Happening.

363
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:30,878
If It's Really That Bad,

364
00:17:30,878 --> 00:17:32,999
Why Don't You
Just Tell Him About Her?

365
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,312
I Can't.
I'll See You Later.

366
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,438
Look, I'm Not Stupid.

367
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:41,641
I Know You're Not
Really Interested

368
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:44,284
In How My Family Owns Half Of
Tribeca. Of Course We're Interested.

369
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:48,566
You're The Newest Member Of Our Little Club. Which
Is Only For The Smartest Girls Of The Junior Class.

370
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,125
Our Junior Class
Only Has 30 Girls.

371
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:52,863
We're Already An Elite Club.
Can I Go Now?

372
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,652
We're Already An Elite Club.
Can I Go Now?

373
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,624
You What Would Be Hot? You,
Us At G Spa. I Don't Drink.

374
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,922
Saks Fifth?
Hate Shopping.

375
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:01,914
Yogurt On The Steps? Lactose-Intolerant.
Look, I Really Don't Want Any Friends.

376
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,100
All I Want Is To Be Alone

377
00:18:03,101 --> 00:18:05,633
<I>And To Never Listen To Flo Rida Ever Again

378
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,030
 What
Happened? A Little Backstage Hit It And Quit It?</I>

379
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:12,343
What? No, My Boyfriend Broke Up
With Me At A Flo Rida Concert.

380
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:14,044
One Minute We Were
Waving Our Hands In The Air

381
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:16,312
Like We Just Didn't Care,
And The Next...

382
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:28,544
Since The Dalton Guys
Were A Bust,

383
00:18:28,545 --> 00:18:29,914
How About Collegiate?

384
00:18:29,915 --> 00:18:32,837
The Boys' Lacrosse Team
Is Working Out Just Around...

385
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,102
Jenny, Look.

386
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:36,938
What Did I Tell You
About That Dog Walker?

387
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:39,038
There Are No Kings
On Craigslist.

388
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:43,727
But I Don't Think
He's The Walker.

389
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:45,511
I Think He's The Owner.

390
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:51,763
I Spy My King.

391
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,869
Hi.

392
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,230
Hi. How Have You Been?

393
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,010
<I>* Hey, My First Flo Stopped
A Gold Diggin' Woman *</I>

394
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,010
<I>* Money Cash Flow
All Big-Faced Hundreds *</I>

395
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,550
<I>* Stuntin' On The Pole,
Got Them D-Boys Runnin' *</I>

396
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,050
<I>* Shorty Got Both Broke,
Can't See What's Coming *</I>

397
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,817
<I>* On My Elevator,
Get It Up *</I>

398
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:18,878
Oh, God. Not That Song.

399
00:19:19,724 --> 00:19:23,259
Nelly Yuki, What's Wrong? It's
Like It's Happening All Over Again.

400
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,448
That Song Just Reminds Me
Of My Boyfriend...

401
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:27,015
My Ex-Boyfriend,
I Should Say.

402
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:31,638
Oh, No. Did He Dump You?
That's Horrible.

403
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:34,389
W- W-What Was His Name?
Brad? Bill?

404
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:36,768
Todd... Jansen.

405
00:19:38,532 --> 00:19:42,140
There's Nothing Like The Fresh,
Sharp Pain Of A Breakup.

406
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:44,659
Believe Me, I've Had
My Fair Share Of Heartache,

407
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,730
But This Is About You.

408
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:47,842
Tonight You're Gonna Come
Over To My House,

409
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:51,274
And Just Cry Till You Get It All Out Of Your
System. I Can't. I Have To Be Focused Tomorrow.

410
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,617
You Can't Focus
When Something's On Your Mind,

411
00:19:53,618 --> 00:19:57,486
Now Can You? Come, Come, Come.
Tell Me All About It.

412
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,973
I Guess I'll Just Take
The Check, Please. Okay.

413
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:11,673
Hey, Hold That, Will Ya?

414
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:15,575
Daylight Savings Moved To March.
Maybe No One Told You. I Know I'm Late.

415
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:17,048
Coffee, Nate?

416
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,574
Yeah, Thanks, Cora.

417
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:22,477
You Two Know Each Other?
I've Been Here Before.

418
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:24,634
Are You Telling Me You Come
All The Way To Brookn

419
00:20:24,635 --> 00:20:27,501
<I>For Greek Food? Well, When I'm In
Brooklyn, I Like To Come Here, Yes.</I>

420
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:30,022
'Cause You're In Brooklyn
All The Time.

421
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:33,080
Well, My-My Father's In Rehab
A Couple Blocks Away,

422
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:35,946
And, Uh, Which, By The Way,
Is Why I'm Late. I Was...

423
00:20:35,947 --> 00:20:39,784
Visiting Hours...
I'm Sorry. I Didn't Mean To-

424
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:41,973
No. I Mean, It's Not Like
It's Some Big Secret.

425
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,890
It Was On The Front Page Of
Every Newspaper In The City.

426
00:20:45,205 --> 00:20:46,565
I Guess It Was, Yeah.

427
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:48,926
Sometimes After
I'm Done Seeing Him,

428
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:51,168
I'm Not Ready To Go Back
And See My Mom Just Yet,

429
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,492
So I Come Here And I Sit
And Just, Uh...

430
00:20:54,123 --> 00:20:55,978
Think About How Hard It Is

431
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:57,605
To Know Whose Side
You're Supposed To Be On,

432
00:20:57,606 --> 00:21:00,226
Mom Versus Dad,
Kid In The Middle?

433
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:07,626
Confession... I Read One
Of Your Practice Essays.

434
00:21:07,627 --> 00:21:10,003
You Left It In A Book
That You Gave Dan,

435
00:21:10,947 --> 00:21:14,571
And That's Why I Called You-
To Apologize.

436
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,130
Why?

437
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:23,007
Because...
I Judged The Cover,

438
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:24,981
But Now That
I've Read The Book,

439
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:27,635
I Figured You Were Owed
Some Apologetic Souvlaki,

440
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:29,414
At The Very Least.

441
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:41,146
Hey, Georgie. It Was Good
To See You Last Night.

442
00:21:41,303 --> 00:21:43,078
When Did You Say
You Were Going Back To Belgium?

443
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,444
Uh, Switzerland, Actually,

444
00:21:44,445 --> 00:21:46,052
And I'm Supposed
To Leave Tomorrow,

445
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:47,420
But I'm Not Going
Until I Get A Chance

446
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:50,424
To Make It Up To You First. Oh,
Nothing To Make Up. I Had Fun.

447
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:53,675
No, You Didn't.
I Mean, Until After You Left,

448
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:55,707
I Don't Think I Really Heard
What You Were Saying.

449
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:59,706
I- I Didn't Get It.
You've Really Changed.

450
00:22:00,225 --> 00:22:01,256
Yeah, I Have.

451
00:22:01,257 --> 00:22:02,466
I Don't Mean
To Sound Corny,

452
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:05,876
But... It's
A Real Inspiration To Me.

453
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:07,179
Really?

454
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,456
I Mean, Look,
I've Always Thought

455
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:11,505
That I Am Who I'm Going To Be
For The Rest Of My Life,

456
00:22:11,787 --> 00:22:15,923
And Even Those Times
When I Maybe Don't Like Myself,

457
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:20,403
Well... You Can't Decide
To Be Somebody Else.

458
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,340
No, You Can. Yeah,
Listen, Let's Have Dinner.

459
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:25,876
I- I Mean, I Want
To Hear About Your Life,

460
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:29,424
And If You Can Change,
Maybe There's Hope For Me, Too.

461
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:31,733
No, I-I Have To Study.
I Have S.A.T.S In The Morning.

462
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:33,940
It'll Just Be An Hour.
We Can Time It. I Promise.

463
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:37,824
The Hardest Drug On The Table
Will Be... Perrier.

464
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,322
<I>Spotted-
Serena Van Der Woodsen</I>

An Hour.

<I>None Of The Above.</I>

472
00:22:58,381 --> 00:22:59,206
Good.

473
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:01,209
<I>Hope That Wasn't
The Wrong Answer, S.</I>

474
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,455

475

Card)
All Right, "Capacious"-

476
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:09,850
Looks Like "Spacious."
What Does It Mean? Roomy.

477
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:11,683
Oh, Yeah.

478
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:13,572
"Captious."

479
00:23:13,573 --> 00:23:15,456
Looks Like...

480
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:17,638
That Looks Like
"Capacious."

481
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,729
Oh. I Can't Concentrate.

482
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,218
Sound Of Your Own Voice
Distracting You?

483
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:24,902
No. It's, Uh, Serena,
Actually.

484
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,032
We Had An Argument.

485
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:27,288
I'm Home!

486
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:30,936
Look It. Trig Identities
Are Memorized,

487
00:23:30,937 --> 00:23:33,604
My Latin Is Resurrected,
And My Lit Paper's Finished.

488
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:35,393
Impressive.
Mm-Hmm.

489
00:23:35,403 --> 00:23:37,624
Huh. Seeing As You've
Returned The Valentino,

490
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,612
And You've Logged Ten Hours
Of Volunteer Work

491
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:40,659
With Betty At The Shop...

492
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,535
I'm Not Grounded Anymore?
I Have Something For You.

493
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,362
No Way!

494
00:23:51,337 --> 00:23:53,936
Oh! It's Not Exactly The
Same As The One You Pawned,

495
00:23:53,996 --> 00:23:55,626
But...

496
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:57,758
Thank You, Dad!

497
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,079
You Know, Jen, No One's Happier
Than Me To See This.

498
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,991
Do You Know How Much It Costs
To Get A Zipper Repaired?

499
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:04,196
Yeah, I Figured Since You'd Be Spending
So Much Time At Home... Wait. What?

500
00:24:04,748 --> 00:24:06,580
So I Guess You're Still Grounded. Dan.

501
00:24:06,974 --> 00:24:08,653
Dad, Wait.
I Met This Really Nice Guy,

502
00:24:08,654 --> 00:24:11,709
And I'm Supposed To Meet Him In The Park For
Lunch Tomorrow. Well, Grounded Or Not Grounded,

503
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:14,869
You're Not Old Enough To Date.
It's Not A Date. He's Just A Friend.

504
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,642
Who Is This Guy? You Don't
Know Him. He Goes To Unity.

505
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:20,311
<I>Wait, Upper East Side Unity?
Technically, That's Upper West Side, Dad.</I>

506
00:24:20,312 --> 00:24:22,584
How Are You Helping? I Thought You Wanted
To Take A Break From That Whole Crowd.

507
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:25,524
What "Whole Crowd"? The One That Made
You Feel Like Compromising Your Character

508
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:29,110
Was A Prerequisite To Hanging Out With Them. So
It's Okay For Dan To Date Someone Rich, Though?

509
00:24:29,111 --> 00:24:31,014
Well, It's Not Without
Its Complications. Believe Me.

510
00:24:31,015 --> 00:24:32,968
I Thought You Said
It Wasn't A Date.

511
00:24:36,486 --> 00:24:37,872
Ugh!

512
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:44,521
It Was Nice There For A Minute. It Was.

513
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:45,848
Hey, S.

514
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:47,746
I'm Just Sipping
A Gingko Biloba Blended

515
00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:50,283
And Wondering How
Your Stomach Migraine Is.

516
00:24:50,284 --> 00:24:52,086
Call Me So I Don't Worry.

517
00:24:52,804 --> 00:24:54,439
How You Doing, Nelly Yuki?

518
00:24:55,523 --> 00:25:00,093
My Upper Trapezius
Seems To Hold A Lot Of Sadness.

519
00:25:01,764 --> 00:25:04,541
Something Tells Me You'll
Be Feeling Better Very Soon...

520
00:25:05,477 --> 00:25:06,710
Any Minute.

521
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:09,051
No. I Think I Should Just
Go Home And Study.

522
00:25:15,566 --> 00:25:18,260
Uh, Mr. Jansen Is Here
To See Miss Yuki.

523
00:25:18,627 --> 00:25:20,007
Todd's Here?

524
00:25:20,813 --> 00:25:22,076
Do I Have Cushion Face?

525
00:25:22,077 --> 00:25:23,289
A Little.

526
00:25:29,743 --> 00:25:31,007
Hello, Todd.

527
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,123
Hi, Nelly. Blair Said
It Was All Right If I Came.

528
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,331
For A Siberian Ginseng Pedi?

529
00:25:36,332 --> 00:25:37,634
No.

530
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:43,308
I Really Feel Bad
About How Things Ended, Nell.

531
00:25:43,444 --> 00:25:44,336
So Do I.

532
00:25:44,337 --> 00:25:46,600
Can We Talk About It? In Private? Okay.

533
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:52,598
Thank You, B.

534
00:25:58,316 --> 00:25:59,143
Lucky For Us,

535
00:25:59,144 --> 00:26:02,583
Mental Acuity And Common Sense
Rarely Come In The Same Package.

536
00:26:04,114 --> 00:26:05,950
Oxygen Facials, Anyone?

537
00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:08,282
Next Time Your Sister's Band
Is In Town,

538
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:09,932
I Want Front Row Seats.

539
00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:12,959
You Don't Strike Me
As A Lesbian Punk Fan.

540
00:26:13,522 --> 00:26:15,373
You Know, I Am Almost
Offended By How Much

541
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,173
You Underestimate Me,
Ms. Abrams.

542
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,106
<I>You Like Punk? Oh, I Didn't Hear You S
- You Said "Punk"?</I>

543
00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:22,072
'Cause You Had Me
At "Lesbian."

544
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:24,875
Oh, Right.
Didn't See That One Coming.

545
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,125
Hey, Tell Me Something.
Yes?

546
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:30,038
Why Do You Do
S.A.T. Practice Tests

547
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:32,865
If You're Not Planning
On Taking The Exam?

548
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:35,037
To Help Dan Study.

549
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,492
I'm A Filmmaker. Best Education
For Me Is Making Films.

550
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:40,988
I Can't Never Met Anyone

551
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:43,048
Who Thought College
Was Optional.

552
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:46,015
My Parents Are Artists.
My Sister's A Musician.

553
00:26:46,016 --> 00:26:48,243
Just Like Going To An Ivy
Is Your Family's Way,

554
00:26:48,244 --> 00:26:50,025
<I>Not Going To College
Is Mine.</I>

555
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,968
Think Your Parents
Want To Adopt A 17 Year Old?

556
00:26:53,198 --> 00:26:54,388
Maybe?

557
00:27:01,391 --> 00:27:03,693
So...

558
00:27:04,674 --> 00:27:06,722
I Guess This Is
Good Night, Then?

559
00:27:08,016 --> 00:27:09,803
I Don't Live Here,
You Know.

560
00:27:09,804 --> 00:27:11,080
No, I Know.

561
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:14,113
I'm Just Grabbing
My Laptop.

562
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:19,430
Do You Want To Come Inside?

563
00:27:25,193 --> 00:27:28,013
God. It Does Feel
Like That Doorstep Moment.

564
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:29,932
And What Moment
Would That Be?

565
00:27:36,677 --> 00:27:38,441
Yeah. That's The Moment.

566
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,888
Can I Get You Two
A Cocktail?

567
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:58,759
Oh. I'm Fine With My Diet Coke.
Thank You.

568
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,948
Um, Yeah, Me, Too.
Thanks.

569
00:28:03,904 --> 00:28:06,034
So... Tell Me About Dan.

570
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:07,265
I Did.
Oh, Come On.

571
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:10,445
His Last Name And His Zip Code?
Scintillating Details.

572
00:28:10,446 --> 00:28:13,107
Come On. He's Part Of
Serena Second Edition.

573
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:15,856
<I>* So Tell Me</I>

574
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:19,207
Well...

575
00:28:20,276 --> 00:28:23,170
I- I Like The Way I Feel
When He Looks At Me.

576
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,536
How?

577
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:27,532
Like...

578
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,597
Like I Wanna
Believe In Myself.

579
00:28:32,428 --> 00:28:33,499
I- I Know.

580
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,096
You Think It's A Clich?

581
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:38,581
Uh, No. No, Sweetie.
I- I-I Think It's...

582
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:41,352
It's Incredible.

583
00:28:41,718 --> 00:28:42,913
Yeah.

584
00:28:42,914 --> 00:28:45,865
Look...
I Know I May Not Be

585
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:47,380
Your Most Trusted Friend
Right Now,

586
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:50,553
But I Think I Know
The Old You Pretty Well.

587
00:28:51,127 --> 00:28:53,314
Yeah, Better Than, Um,
Anyone, Actually.

588
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,704
Well, From Where I Sit,
It Would Take...

589
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:59,389
A Lot To Bring
That Person Back.

590
00:29:02,953 --> 00:29:06,112
Um... I'm Gonna Call Him,
Actually.

591
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:07,610
He's Pretty Nervous
About Tomorrow,

592
00:29:07,611 --> 00:29:09,797
So I Wanna Wish Him Luck.
So I'll Be Back.

593
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:14,186
<I>* Whole Thing</I>

594
00:29:14,216 --> 00:29:18,516
<I>* It's Time To Let It Explode</I>

595
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:21,516
<I>* I'm Starting, Ooh</I>

596
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,554
That Was Quick.
Yeah, He Didn't Pick Up.

597
00:29:40,555 --> 00:29:42,867
Oh, You Can Try Him Again Later. Yeah.

598
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:46,132
Okay, I'd Like To Propose A Toast. Okay.

599
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,505
To The New You.

600
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:50,904
To The New Me.

601
00:29:51,102 --> 00:29:52,313
Cheers.

602
00:30:11,155 --> 00:30:13,379
Ooh. You Don't Look So Good.

603
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,844
You Okay, S.?

604
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:17,035
No, I'm Not Okay.

605
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:20,604
Wait, How Did We Get Here?
What Are We Doing Here?

606
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:24,989
Oh, My God. I'm Supposed To Be
At Hunter College.

607
00:30:25,376 --> 00:30:28,216
If Memory Serves,
And It Usually Does,

608
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:30,771
They Don't Let You In If
You're Late. Oh, My God.

609
00:30:31,023 --> 00:30:32,583
I'm Thinking Eggs.

610
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:37,158
Do You Want...
Florentine Or Benedict?

611
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:39,155
Wait.
I Was Drinking Soda, Georgie.

612
00:30:39,156 --> 00:30:41,170
Yeah, Until You Switched
To PatrN.

613
00:30:41,545 --> 00:30:44,068
Look, Don't Worry. I Called Lily
And Covered Your Ass.

614
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:46,134
So... You're Welcome.

615
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,718
No, You-You Knew
I Had S.A.T.S This Morning.

616
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:49,915
<I>Which Is Why
I Brought You Here</I>

617
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:52,296
Instead Of Letting You Go Home
With One Of Your Many Suitors.

618
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:54,227
You Know The Guy
With The Ironic Mustache?

619
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:58,361
You Two Took Over The Deejay Booth. Wait,
A Mustache? What Are You Talking About?

620
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:00,950
I Guess You Haven't Changed
As Much As You Thought.

621
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:16,868
Chuck?
Chuck, Hey. I'm In Trouble.

622
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:18,188
Look, I Think
I Can Still Make It,

623
00:31:18,189 --> 00:31:19,961
But Please Go To Hunter,

624
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:22,285
Try To Keep The Doors Open
Until I Get There.

625
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:26,946
Hey!

626
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:33,797
Last Night Was Strange,
But Very Fun.

627
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:37,861
???Like... Five Hours Ago?

628
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,024
I'm Taking You Somewhere.
I'm Going Somewhere-To Work.

629
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:42,748
Get Someone To Cover For You. I
Can't Just Jump In The Car With You

630
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:44,624
Because You Decide To Show Up.
Well, I'm Not Asking You To.

631
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,879
This Is A Onetime Offer,
And There's A Clock Ticking.

632
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:52,390
But...

633
00:31:56,694 --> 00:31:58,914
Fine. I Am Intrigued.

634
00:32:08,824 --> 00:32:10,504
You Wish Your Brother
Good Luck Today?

635
00:32:11,326 --> 00:32:12,462
Yeah.

636
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:18,341
May I Be Excused?

637
00:32:18,342 --> 00:32:19,840
No, You May Not.

638
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:22,243
And We Are Not Gonna
Walk Around This House All Day

639
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:23,598
And Not Talk To Each Other.

640
00:32:25,247 --> 00:32:28,656
Fine. You Want Me To Speak?
I'll Speak.

641
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:31,451
You've Completely And Entirely
Prejudged The Upper East Side.

642
00:32:31,452 --> 00:32:33,954
Maybe You Shouldn't Speak. Dad, I
Learned My Lesson On My Birthday.

643
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:35,871
Asher's Not Like Those Girls.
He's Different.

644
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:39,171
I Mean, He's Nice And Polite
And He Likes Animals.

645
00:32:41,068 --> 00:32:42,623
Please Let Me Go Today?

646
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,713
So You Didn't Cancel?

647
00:32:46,023 --> 00:32:47,652
I Thought
You'd Change Your Mind.

648
00:32:51,117 --> 00:32:52,236
I Haven't.

649
00:33:01,226 --> 00:33:03,081
Nate,
I Don't Know About This.

650
00:33:05,348 --> 00:33:07,833
I Can't.
I Didn't Even Study.

651
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:09,285
Yeah, And You Still Made
Great Scores

652
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:10,527
On Your Practice Tests.

653
00:33:10,528 --> 00:33:12,156
That Was For Fun.

654
00:33:12,794 --> 00:33:15,891
Listen, There's Nothing Wrong
With Keeping Your Options Open.

655
00:33:15,892 --> 00:33:17,584
I Don't Think Your Parents
Are Gonna Be Mad At You

656
00:33:17,585 --> 00:33:18,758
For Choosing Your Own Path...

657
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:21,535
<I>Unless They're Related
To My Parents.</I>

658
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:30,470
Okay. Right Now
I'm Going Inside,

659
00:33:30,471 --> 00:33:33,529
And I'm Not Looking Back,
Or I Might Change My Mind.

660
00:33:42,456 --> 00:33:43,939
...Do Really Well.
What?

661
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,428
Rough Night?

662
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:49,331
<I>Yeah,
And Not In A Good Way.</I>

663
00:33:49,602 --> 00:33:52,294
Todd Doesn't Wanna
Get Back Together. No?

664
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:53,264
But He Said...

665
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,252
We Stayed Up All Night
Having The Same Conversation

666
00:33:55,253 --> 00:33:59,820
About Why We Broke Up Over And Over Again.
Unbelievable. I Can't Believe It. Crazy.

667
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:02,091
Dogboy. I'm So Sorry.
Oh, My Gosh. That's Awful.

668
00:34:02,092 --> 00:34:05,132
I Got No Sleep,
Spent The Whole Night Crying.

669
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,819
Okay. Well, Good Luck.

670
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:14,379
Do You Really Think
This Is Gonna Work?

671
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,438
Yes, But I Also Believe
In Insurance.

672
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:20,172
From Her Calculator.

673
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:22,690
You Never Did Tell Us
How You Got Todd To Play Along.

674
00:34:23,138 --> 00:34:25,136
Isabel, What Are You Doing
Later Tonight?

675
00:34:25,321 --> 00:34:27,632
<I>Uh, Not Todd.
Okay, Well,</I>

676
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,883
I Guess I'm Gonna Have
To Come Up With Something Else.

677
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,794
Dan... Where's Serena?

678
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,943
Uh, I Don't Know,
But I Bet Chuck Does.

679
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:40,410
Ugh. Well, I'll Try To Save A Seat
For Her. Yeah, I'll-I'll Keep Calling.

680
00:34:43,397 --> 00:34:46,284
Hey, Serena, It's Me-
A- A Very Worried Me

681
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:47,961
Concerned About
A Very Missing You.

682
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:50,031
Hi.
I'm Serena Van Der Woodsen.

683
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,348
How'd You Do?

684
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:00,770
Uh, Not My Finest Hour.

685
00:35:00,771 --> 00:35:03,953
I Finished, But... I Kinda
Had A Lot On My Mind.

686
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,304
I'll Keep Calling.

687
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:06,922
Yeah. I Think I Know
Where To Find Her.

688
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,136
Hey, S. It's B.

689
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:12,789
Now I'm Really Worried.

690
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:15,171
I'm Gonna Go Home
And Change,

691
00:35:15,172 --> 00:35:16,242
And Then...

692
00:35:23,683 --> 00:35:25,473
Call Me. Bye.

693
00:35:53,128 --> 00:35:54,031
Hey.

694
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:58,453
What's Going On?

695
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,239
Um... Nothing. I'm Fine.

696
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,409
No, You're Not, And You Need
To Stop Saying That.

697
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,001
Hey. Come Here.

698
00:36:06,926 --> 00:36:08,341
Where Were You?

699
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:09,915
She Was With Me.

700
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:14,034
What He Means Is,
We Were Both At Home.

701
00:36:14,035 --> 00:36:18,206
Um, My Stomach Started Acting Up Again.
Oh, Okay. A Food Poisoning Relapse?

702
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:19,969
Look, If-If-If You Didn't
Study Enough

703
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,772
And You're Freaked Out, I Can
- I Told You. I Was Sick.

704
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:26,750
You Paid Someone Else
To Take The S.A.T. For You,

705
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,727
And That's The Best You Can
Do? What Are You Talking About?

706
00:36:29,728 --> 00:36:31,895
I'm Talking About
The 5-Foot-Nothing Redhead

707
00:36:31,896 --> 00:36:33,369
Claiming To Be
Serena Van Der Woodsen.

708
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:37,442
I'm-I'm Pretty Sure That Wasn't You. Chuck, What
Did You Do? I Told You To Keep The Doors Open.

709
00:36:37,443 --> 00:36:40,791
When I Got There, They Were Closed.
Yeah, They Don't Keep The Doors Open.

710
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:43,621
I Was Thinking On My Feet,
Just Trying To Help.

711
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,680
I'm Not Mad.
Okay, I'm Just Worried.

712
00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:49,925
I've Been So Worried
About You.

713
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,909
<I>Please, Help Me Understand
What's Going On Here.</I>

714
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,983
Can We Talk Tomorrow?

715
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,825
I'll Call You.

716
00:37:03,468 --> 00:37:05,009
I'm Sorry.

717
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:15,325
I'm Sorry, Too.

718
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:27,675
Chuck, You Went Too Far.

719
00:37:27,676 --> 00:37:28,703
And So Did You, Sis.

720
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,333
Look, I Feel Foolish
For Admitting It,

721
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,706
But Obviously,
I've Come Late To This Party.

722
00:37:34,707 --> 00:37:35,802
English, Please.

723
00:37:35,803 --> 00:37:38,748
What's Georgina Got On You?
Chuck...

724
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:42,358
Dan I Understand, But What's
So Bad You Can't Even Tell Me?

725
00:37:56,413 --> 00:37:57,702
Oh, Hi, Sweetie.

726
00:37:57,703 --> 00:37:59,116
Let Me Just, Uh,
Call Some Room Service-

727
00:37:59,117 --> 00:38:01,042
I Don't Want You
To Ever Contact Me Again.

728
00:38:02,591 --> 00:38:04,366
Just Because Of
A Few Nights Of Harmless Fun?

729
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:07,778
It Wasn't Fun Waking Up
And Not Knowing Where I Was,

730
00:38:07,928 --> 00:38:10,409
It Wasn't Fun
Missing The S.A.T.S,

731
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,154
<I>And It Definitely Wasn't Fun
Lying To Dan.</I>

732
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,777
And This Is All My Fault
Because...

733
00:38:15,778 --> 00:38:17,082
<I>It's My Fault,</I>

734
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,851
Because I Make Huge Mistakes
When I'm With You.

735
00:38:20,552 --> 00:38:22,617
So You Want To Distance Yourself
From Your "Mistakes"

736
00:38:22,618 --> 00:38:24,290
By Staying Away From Me?

737
00:38:24,376 --> 00:38:26,278
You Were There, Too, Serena.

738
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:31,138
It Was Just As Much You, If Not More
- This Is Not About Last Year. It's About Last Night.

739
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:32,759
Like You Were
Just Some Innocent Bystander

740
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,409
<I>Who Walked In On
- I'm Not Talking About It, Georgina! Okay?</I>

741
00:38:39,592 --> 00:38:41,507
And Neither Are You.

742
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,403
<I>If I Go Down,</I>

743
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,279
<I>You Go Down With Me.</I>

744
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:47,827
In The Meantime,

745
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:49,555
Stay Out Of My Life.

746
00:38:51,249 --> 00:38:53,761
I Don't Need Anybody In My Life
Who Doesn't Want To Be There.

747
00:38:53,762 --> 00:38:55,313
Then We're Agreed.

748
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:23,135
You Must Be The Unity Boy.

749
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,503
Uh, Hopefully, There's Not
Another One On His Way.

750
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:28,189
Name's Asher,
And I Do Go To Unity.

751
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,892
Hi.

752
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:34,858
Asher?

753
00:39:37,772 --> 00:39:39,153
What Are You Doing Here?

754
00:39:39,228 --> 00:39:41,050
I Was Just Gonna Ask
The Same Thing.

755
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:42,849
Uh, Since You Couldn't
Come To The Hot Dogs,

756
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,347
I'm Bringing Them To You.

757
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,504
Sorry To S-Surprise You, Sir.

758
00:39:48,702 --> 00:39:50,364
That's So Sweet,
Especially Since

759
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:52,806
My Unreasonable Father
Has Grounded Me For Life.

760
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,920
I'm Standing Right Here.

761
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:56,190
I Wish
More Of My Friends' Parents

762
00:39:56,191 --> 00:39:58,389
Cared Enough To Ground Them
When They Messed Up.

763
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:02,580
<I>Looks Like Our Queen Wannabe
Found Her Perfect King.</I>

764
00:40:02,718 --> 00:40:04,368
Well, Since You're Here...

765
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,286
With A Year's Supply
Of Hot Dogs,

766
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:09,926
Maybe You'd Like To Come In.

767
00:40:10,056 --> 00:40:12,138
<I>We Hear He's A Unity Man.</I>

768
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:14,445
<I>Guess Big Brother's
Been Teaching Little Sis</I>

769
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:16,830
<I>How To Snag The Ones
With A Trust Fund.</I>

770
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,885
Hi.

771
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,977
Hey, Buddy, There You Go.

772
00:40:25,978 --> 00:40:28,626
Aw! Georgie, Hey!

773
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:30,241
Bad Boy.

774
00:40:30,242 --> 00:40:31,974
Sorry He Disturbed You.

775
00:40:31,987 --> 00:40:33,438
Uh, It's Fine.
I Love Dogs.

776
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:36,592
Really? Do You Have Any?
No. Uh, We Used To Have A Cat,

777
00:40:36,593 --> 00:40:38,760
But, You Know...
Sister... Allergies.

778
00:40:38,761 --> 00:40:42,438
Now The Cat-Iggy-Lives
In Florida With My Grandma.

779
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:45,015
I... He Doesn't Write.
He Never Calls.

780
00:40:45,717 --> 00:40:46,952
I'm Sorry To Hear That.

781
00:40:46,953 --> 00:40:48,233
It's Just A Cat.

782
00:40:50,821 --> 00:40:53,144
Um. I'm Sarah, By The Way.

783
00:40:52,844 --> 00:40:55,585
I'm Dan.
Nice To Meet You, Sarah.

775
