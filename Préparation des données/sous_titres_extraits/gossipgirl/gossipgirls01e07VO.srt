00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,713
gossip girl here--your one and only source

2
00:00:02,154 --> 00:00:05,654
into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.

3
00:00:05,654 --> 00:00:07,300
you'll never believe what's on "gossip girl.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,500
" someone saw serena getting off a train at grand central.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,000
i thought everything was good between us.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,300
it was, before i found out you had sex with my boyfriend.

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,600
i didn't come back for you.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,959
look, blair's my best friend, and you're her boyfriend,

9
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,857
and she loves you. you'd really go out with some guy you don't know?

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,087
well, you can't be worse than the guys i do know. this party is for you.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,959
okay, so you can meet people, become a part of something.

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,200
nathaniel i'm shocked.

13
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,915
i thought you were strictly an herbal man. this isn't mine.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,500
...which is how i found this.

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,279
it isn't mine, and it isn't your father's.

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,000
what do you have to say for yourself, nate?

17
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,000
you said you love me.

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,336
loved you. i'm sorry i kissed you, but i did it

19
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,600
because i thought he should know how it feels to lose you.

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,400
i like you, only you.

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,800
that's good because i feel the same about you.

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,600
the masks come off at midnight, and i kind of need my disguise.

23
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,670
you know what? you wanna trade? sure.

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,000
serena, i know we both care about blair,

25
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,100
but maybe the best thing is for me

26
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,200
to just tell her the truth. i'm not over you. oh!

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,200
nate? serena.

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,100
hey! have you seen nate?

29
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,500
jenny.

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,200
have you heard, upper east siders?

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,100
burlesque is all the rage again,

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,600
and sometimes a little raging is exactly what you need.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,400
and as always,

34
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
chuck's aiming to be ahead of the curves.

35
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,400
who's that girl?

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
i have no idea.

37
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,300
but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

38
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,001
- δĻ -

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,100
you want your dad to invest in a strip joint?

40
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,300
how midtown. a burlesque club-- a respectable place

41
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,600
where people can be transported to another time,

42
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,200
where they can feel free to let loose.

43
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
no judgment. pure escape.

44
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,600
what happens at victrola stays at victrola.

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
well, it does have franchise potential.

46
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,600
chuck bass,

47
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,907
i do believe all your years of underage boozing

48
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,300
truly, i am proud.

49
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,971
and you are my toughest critic. well, second toughest.

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,900
so do you think your father will go for it?

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,500
it is exactly the kind of innovative thinking

52
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,300
upon which the bass empire was built.

53
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,267
it is the perfect thing. i've been waiting for this. we are so late.

54
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,300
gotta pitch it to bart.

55
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,300
victory party here tomorrow.

56
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,044
i wouldn't miss it. i'll send a car.

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,300
don't be nervous. he's gonna love it.

58
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,700
they all seem very discreet. it's up to you,

59
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,523
but you will choose a facility,

60
00:03:17,523 --> 00:03:19,700
and you will get the help that you need, after our dinner

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,800
unless you'd like to ruin the celebration honoring

62
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,900
anne, it's all right. let me talk to him.

63
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,000
how could you not tell her the drugs were yours?

64
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,100
you're not gonna end up in one of these places.

65
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,040
let me talk to her. you know how your mother overreacts.

66
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,100
yeah, 'cause it's mom who's the problem, right?

67
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,300
look, work's been kicking my ass lately.

68
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,500
the old man doesn't wear the hours as well as he used to.

69
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,200
this young viper at the office, frank meltzer,

70
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,000
saw me fading one night, so he offered me a pick-me-up.

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,700
it was stupid. i didn't even like it.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
hey, i'll flush the bag right now, all right?

73
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,000
dad, i just want you to be--

74
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,000
look, let's not put a damper on the upcoming festivities.

75
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,700
i've landed the waldorf account,

76
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,200
and my son has landed the waldorf.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,600
so that's it?

78
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,400
hey, i'm not cutting the conversation short.

79
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,800
drinks after school at the club?

80
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,100
nonalcoholic, of course.

81
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,100
no, you don't understand, vanessa.

82
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,400
okay, the store lent it to me for the ball,

83
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,100
and if i don't find it, blair is gonna kill me.

84
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,300
it's under her name,

85
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,500
and she doesn't even know i went.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,500
no, alison, i sent that two weeks ago.

87
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,800
dad, have you seen a bracelet?

88
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,500
you know, round, silverish, sparkly? yeah, i think i saw that

89
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,580
next to that ambiguous vague thing by the nondescript place.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,700
he hasn't seen it.

91
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,800
no, alison, i-wh--i haven't told them anything yet.

92
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,400
well, what should i be telling them

93
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,500
when i don't even know what's...

94
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
who you talking to?

95
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,100
your mother. tell her i say hi.

96
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,500
jenny says hello.

97
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,200
who are you talking to?

98
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,900
where's the other humphrey?

99
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,600
ow. brick not comfortable.

100
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,900
all right, i'll take one for the team.

101
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,000
ooh! yeah, this is definitely not very comfortable.

102
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,700
i know. you'd think all the money that we spent

103
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,000
on this private school, they could at least

104
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,600
or a better chemistry teacher. mr. peiser is a little weird.

105
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,000
wait, you're thinking about mr. peiser right now?

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,100
we are at school.

107
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,500
hey, serena. ugh.

108
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,873
why don't you get a room? oh, that's the plight of the manhattan teenager.

109
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,100
no cars.

110
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,800
you know, we could find a place more private.

111
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,000
our parents aren't always home.

112
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,000
that's true.

113
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,400
they must eventually leave.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,600
the problem is waiting for eventually.

115
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,200
what's the rush? really, it's not like this sucks.

116
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,900
minus the brick and the paparazzi.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
spotted-- serena and not-so-lonely boy

118
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,200
clearly past courtship in the courtyard.

119
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,000
bye.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,800
you know, we should talk about this, though,

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,300
about us,

122
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,900
about eventually.

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,200
definitely. yes.

124
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,600
or we could just get it over with in a broom closet.

125
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,200
in a broom closet?

126
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,500
that is-- that is rich, serena.

127
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,700
mr. peiser's waiting.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,700
but can brooklyn keep up with the uptown express?

129
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,800
oh. serena, right?

130
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,800
uh, that's... funny.

131
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,800
mm, not really. no.

132
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,200
no.

133
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,200
uh, what are you doing in the girls' hall?

134
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,800
i was actually looking for you.

135
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,100
you know, i really didn't mean anything i said

136
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,000
about having feelings for serena. maybe you didn't. i just--

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,300
i mean, i don't even care, but other people might.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,500
yeah, i know.

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,800
yeah, including my brother.

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,400
you brought me chocolates?

141
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,500
well, i know you care about being friends with blair,

142
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,700
and your brother-- he's with serena,

143
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,300
and i just really need you to help me out here.

144
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,400
you promise?

145
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,200
promise what?

146
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,600
uh, promise to help me

147
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,500
oh. i'm sorry for taking you for granted lately, okay?

148
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,800
that is so sweet! but i prefer the gold collection,

149
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,400
but thank you.

150
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,700
hey, cinderella.

151
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,400
i think you dropped this at the ball.

152
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,600
i hate secrets more than anything.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,700
you know that.

154
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,500
friends don't lie, and we're friends, right?

155
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,800
right.

156
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,800
jenny humphrey's rise to the penthouse

157
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,600
but if she crosses blair waldorf,

158
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,100
it's straight back to the basement.

159
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,800
looks like this little lamb needs to stay silent or else.

160
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,000
when can i go public with you?

161
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,000
my kids have to know first.

162
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,200
well, your secret's safe with me.

163
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,100
father.

164
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,700
chuck.

165
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,000
um, well... bart,

166
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,300
um, i think your points earlier were excellent...

167
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,600
mm-hmm. and, um, i plan to bring them up

168
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,800
at the next parent/teacher meeting.

169
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,600
um, thank you, lily.

170
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,200
not much future as an actress.

171
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,900
you don't say anything to serena.

172
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,200
you don't say anything to anyone.

173
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,300
lily would like this to play out in a certain way.

174
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,700
so you're serious about her?

175
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,700
what's with the business formal?

176
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,500
are you being arraigned for something?

177
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,100
i have an investment idea

178
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,400
i think is utterly unique to your company.

179
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,600
something avant-garde, yet nostalgic.

180
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,800
it is the perfect way for you

181
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,000
like you've been wanting, sir.

182
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,200
i am so pleased.

183
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,400
you are?

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,700
are you kidding me?

185
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,500
do you how long i've been waiting for you

186
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,500
to be interested in something other than partying?

187
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,400
you should come see the place.

188
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,200
it sells itself.

189
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,500
i have some meetings, but, uh, how's after--

190
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,100
a-after's--after's great.

191
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,100
after's good.

192
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,300
so... i heard on "gossip girl"

193
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,200
that you were having sex with dan out here...

194
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,500
in streaming video.

195
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,100
ugh! god, kati and is filmed us?

196
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,500
oh, it's all very

197
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,500
and no, they haven't streamed it yet, but...

198
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,100
i heard it was... aggressive.

199
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,061
i must say, dan has been surprisingly good

200
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,000
at everything we've done. which is... everything?

201
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,900
no!  but feel free to ask any personal questions.

202
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,122
but you've talked about it, right? no, mom, we haven't.

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,200
may i remind you that this is your first real boyfriend, s.,

204
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,000
and in relationships, you talk about stuff.

205
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:04,400
i know, but i don't know, sometimes talking about it

206
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,100
i would know.

207
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
well, as long as you're not worried.

208
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,400
well, i'm not, but i don't know, he might be.

209
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,600
is it possible for a guy to want to slow things down?

210
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,000
only the guys we like.

211
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,300
but... with you,

212
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,500
i can't imagine why.

213
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,500
how was i?

214
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,400
i don't know. let's ask the judges. hmm.

215
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,800
i was gonna give you a 3,

216
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
but since you're a virgin, i gave you an extra point.

217
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,000
hey, i chose to wait.

218
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,300
sex is meaningful, like art, and you don't rush art.

219
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,600
who's art? did you sleep with him?

220
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,200
did you sleep with him?

221
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,900
did you or did you not sleep with him?

222
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,300
yes, alison, i did encourage you to do your paintings,

223
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,920
not the next door neighbor. hello?

224
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,700
hello?

225
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,900
ah, dan, i-i didn't realize you were home.

226
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,800
i'm sorry you had to hear that.

227
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,700
well, i did. something about, uh, uh, mom and a neighbor?

228
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,700
yeah, it's... complicated.

229
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,880
mom's having an affair. it's easy when you just say it. not to your son.

230
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,300
well, she hasn't exactly been rushing back to us.

231
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,500
it's good to know why.

232
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,100
i'm home. what's going on, dad?

233
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,300
uh, nothing. just gotta get some groceries.

234
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,900
dan?

235
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,900
uh, sorry, jen. i got a lot of homework, so...

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,500
ey, dad. i'm, like, ten blocks away.

237
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,200
what?

238
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,200
oh, sorry, nate.

239
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,000
i have to take a rain check on our drink.

240
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,200
why?

241
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,500
client in crisis. can't get out of the office,

242
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,200
but i'll be home as soon as i can.

243
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,600
well, dad, our talk was kind of important.

244
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,880
it's business, nate. you understand, right?

245
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,000
we'll talk later.

246
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,700
looks like parents can be deceiving n both sides of the bridge.

247
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,300
you are...

248
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,900
really talented.

249
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,900
dad.

250
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,500
i, uh, ahem. i didn't think you'd make it.

251
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,200
and you want me to pour hundreds of thousands of dollars

252
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,900
into an excuse for you to be around booze and women?

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,300
no. no, i... did you read the proposal?

254
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,300
it shows a much bigger picture.

255
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,300
i came down here because i saw the effort you made.

256
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
you want to impress me with your commitment to something?

257
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,600
try getting a few a's in school or maybe a part-time job.

258
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,800
s like the pot calling the kettle black

259
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,300
and if we know chuck, he's not one to let things lie.

260
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,700
someone pour that man a drink.

261
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,900
you need to look elegant for the archibald dinner

262
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:31,301
tomorrow night, so what do you think? yes, it would be very nice,

263
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:32,200
if i was sailing up on the mayflower.

264
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,100
anne archibald was wearing

265
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
her amazing cornelius vanderbilt diamond ring the other night.

266
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,300
she was going on and on

267
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,300
about how it would end up on your finger...

268
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,200
wait. nate spoke to his mother about our future?

269
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,600
he actually asked for the family ring?

270
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,800
oks like cold, hard cash an get you the cold, rd truth.

271
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,800
didn't anyone tell you, n.? be careful what you fish for.

272
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,900
can't believe we actually got the apartment to ourselves.

273
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,100
you got downtown pretty fast. well, with an opportunity like this,

274
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,100
one needs to take advantage. mmm.

275
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,500
how long do you think ill your dad and sister will be back?

276
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
uh, anywhere from an hour to 20 minutes?

277
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,000
well, 20 minutes is plenty.

278
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
it's kind of bright in here, don't you think?

279
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,000
mm, how about next time?

280
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:17,301
(vanessa) hey, dan. hungry?

281
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,900
hello.

282
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,000
hi.

283
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,700
hi. vanessa, right?

284
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,200
good to see you. good to see you.

285
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,200
and good to see you seeing us

286
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,640
seeing you.

287
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,100
excuse me.

288
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,300
you really need to start using that door. which you're showing me to.

289
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:40,700
well, practice makes perfect. leaving, out the door.

290
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,973
and we appreciate it.

291
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,656
orry.

292
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,300
so do you think we should talk about it?

293
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,100
oh. you mean about-- about vanessa?

294
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,200
no, you know what? she's like family. it feels comfortable,

295
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,400
and so therefore, she often shows up without calling.

296
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,500
no, i-i mean about what almost, maybe, might have just happened.

297
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,200
oh, you mean if vanessa hadn't entered,

298
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,400
and we...

299
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,900
or we could not talk about it.

300
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,100
dan, we're home.

301
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,300
we got breakfast.

302
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,700
hungry?

303
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,900
spotted-- bass drunk off his ass t the palace bar,

304
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,600
drinking away his woes and investment capital.

305
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,700
nathaniel, your position in my esteem

306
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,000
has been replaced by your voice mail.

307
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,400
so... bart didn't go for victrola,

308
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,400
but truth is i bought the house out already for tonight,

309
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,600
and it's not a par-tay without my people r any people.

310
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,300
i'll see you there.

311
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,300
long night?

312
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,400
alfonso made me an omelet.

313
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:22,900
i may have washed it down with a bellini or two.

314
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,100
you father didn't go for your business proposal.

315
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,000
come on.

316
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,300
he was born poor. i was born loaded. yeah.

317
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,300
but if the only way to impress him

318
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,700
is if i started with nothing,

319
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,400
then why doesn't he just take it all away?

320
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,500
because he loves you.

321
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,200
no good parent likes to see his child go without.

322
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
i had the idea. i did the work.

323
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,600
he tells me i can't be committed,

324
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,300
and he's the one screwing 25 year olds...

325
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,300
when he's supposedly committed to you.

326
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,400
we're newly committed, as recent as last week.

327
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,000
i wonder why he was pawing some asian chick

328
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,300
n his limo yesterday.

329
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,300
how could i be surprised, really?

330
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,300
i'm on my way.

331
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,700
uh, i'm late for my blowout at arden's.

332
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,500
mom, please.

333
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,700
the drugs were dad's.

334
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,300
i mean, i guess he thought it'd be easier on everyone

335
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,900
if i took the hit, but they were his.

336
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,325
i don't understand.

337
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,100
no, he promised me he'd flush the coke,

338
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,200
then i caught him buying more.

339
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
the lengths that you will go to to get out of trouble, nate.

340
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,900
mom, he has a problem. i need your help, please.

341
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,000
you look down at the floor

342
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,956
every time someone tries to tell you the truth.

343
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,700
just look at me.

344
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,600
mom.

345
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,500
i saw dad buying drugs yesterday.

346
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,600
he's been under a lot of pressure,

347
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,800
and if you hadn't been so difficult lately...

348
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,800
what?

349
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,100
your latest rebellions have been very hard on your father, nate.

350
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,400
all this business with dartmouth,

351
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,400
your issues with blair.

352
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,300
mom, dad needs your help.

353
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,200
not another word of this.

354
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
we have a celebratory dinner to get to.

355
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,500
please wear a tie.

356
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,600
see...

357
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,600
you curl your fingers into a fist,

358
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,100
and with simple thrust of force,

359
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,200
you knock on the door.

360
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,600
hey, i didn't use the fire escape.

361
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,500
baby steps.

362
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,700
and what are you doing watching porn?

363
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,500
it's not porn. it's art cinema.

364
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,000
oh, from what i saw earlier, you don't need to be doing research.

365
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,100
i can't talk about this with you.

366
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,368
i'm curious, though, about the change in your attitude,

367
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,400
because may i remind you,

368
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,700
that in your pale, romantic, tortured days,

369
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,500
you'd wax on, and i quote, that,

370
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,300
"sex is meaningful, like art, and you don't rush art."

371
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,200
that was in, uh, 2005.

372
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,000
i was more idealistic then. i was much younger,

373
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
and there wasn't an actual girl who wanted to have sex with me.

374
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,300
you're...

375
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,500
going to lose your virginity.

376
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
ooh, can you...

377
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,500
my friend dan.

378
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,400
please not turn my sex life into a country song?

379
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,800
it's okay. i'm sure  serena knows what to do,

380
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,400
what with her vast experiences

381
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,600
with boarding school professors,

382
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,100
pamplonian bullfighters,

383
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,500
best friends' boyfriends...

384
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,400
that's enough now. you can go. please.

385
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,300
but if it were me with you...

386
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
i'd want you to hide cedric,

387
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,600
maybe get some candles

388
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,000
and replace the football sheets.

389
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,900
but... take it or leave it.

390
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,600
thanks.

391
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,700
i didn't know a broken clasp could cost that much.

392
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,600
oh, it was my pleasure. oh, wait. no, it wasn't.

393
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,300
game recognizes game, little j.,

394
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,800
but you have to show more respect.

395
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,800
this is the last time i've helped you.

396
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,000
next time you cross me, i won't be as forgiving.

397
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,400
don't worry. there won't be a next time.

398
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,100
good, 'cause i wanna tell you something,

399
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,200
something nobody knows, not even serena.

400
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
you can keep a secret, right? of course.

401
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,100
nate is planning on giving me his family diamond.

402
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,100
it's the most incredible ring you've ever seen.

403
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,600
uh, ring as in engagement ring?

404
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,600
i remember the first time i ever saw him.

405
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,200
maybe we were just little kids,

406
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,300
but i knew-- he's the one i wanna marry.

407
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,600
now it seems like he feels the same way, too.

408
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,700
why are you not happy for me?

409
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,900
i'm sorry.

410
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,000
it's--it's just been a really weird week.

411
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,500
um, there's this stuff with my parents

412
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,200
and my family, so maybe i should just go.

413
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,800
no, maybe you should look at me in the eye

414
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,900
and tell me what you're hiding.

415
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,900
e you jealous? of you and nate?

416
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,600
do you like him? what? no.

417
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
do you think because you talked to him once in the hall

418
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,100
that you might have a shot? blair, it's nothing like that.

419
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,400
then tell me, what is it like? i don't want to hurt you.

420
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,089
how could you hurt me?

421
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,616
yesterday wasn't the first time i talked to nate.

422
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,600
at the ball, he told me he wasn't over serena.

423
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,500
why would he tell you that?

424
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,800
cause i was wearing her mask,

425
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,400
and he thought i was her.

426
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,100
he kissed me.

427
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,400
that's enough.

428
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,800
blair, i-i didn't want you to find out.

429
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,100
you're dismissed, jenny... for good.

430
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,400
you look beautiful tonight.

431
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,700
anything on your mind?

432
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,100
no.

433
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,000
is there anything you wanna say?

434
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,000
no.

435
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,300
the leg wrap-- that's interesting.

436
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,500
sexy, right? and it increases stability.

437
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,500
mm-hmm. sure. yeah, i can see that.

438
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,500
he hair grab-- does that really work?

439
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,400
oh, yeah. every time.

440
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,600
okay, so leg wrap to hair grab.

441
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,700
do... hold on a second.

442
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,000
do--do i have to keep my shirt open and billowing like that?

443
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,400
well, it never hurts.

444
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,400
nice.

445
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,300
i'm--i'm doomed.

446
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,800
"sensuous massage." something we should talk about?

447
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,200
oh, uh, no.

448
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,800
you know, i have a lot of-- a lot of tension, stress

449
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,200
in between my, um, shoulder blades.

450
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,000
so...

451
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,400
i'm headed to the gallery

452
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,200
to, uh, test run a 24-hour projection installation.

453
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,300
vanessa and jenny are over there. do you want to come?

454
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,900
um, 24 hours is a very long time to be working straight.

455
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,700
so i think i might just chill here.

456
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,100
alone?

457
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,700
on a saturday night?

458
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,300
with your new girlfriend?

459
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
son...

460
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,400
dad, we've had the talk already.

461
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,700
do you need a refresher?

462
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,600
etched in my brain. thanks.

463
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,700
well, just be safe.

464
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,500
don't do anything you're not ready to do--or she's not.

465
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,100
oh, and, uh, lose the football sheets...

466
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,000
and cedric.

467
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,300
well, you look pretty good for a dead messenger.

468
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,700
i thought i was doing the right thing.

469
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,400
you did. now blair knows the truth,

470
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,400
and she and nate can talk about it.

471
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,800
honest communication

472
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,500
is what every good relationship is based on,

473
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,700
at least, that's what i hear. i just--i think how i'd feel, you know,

474
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,800
if i loved someone, and they betrayed me.

475
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,750
how would you ever get things back to the way they were?

476
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,400
wait, are we still talking about blair and nate here? yeah, of course.

477
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,500
what else can we be talking about?

478
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,780
i don't know. your parents?

479
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,400
look, maybe you don't go back, maybe you go forward.

480
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,000
get two people in a room willing to be balls-out honest?

481
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,900
it might get ugly, but eventually,

482
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,400
the dust has to settle, and then you can see if there's hope.

483
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,200
we've celebrated the partnership,

484
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:57,200
but i don't think we've given eleanor her just due.

485
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,000
this lady is fantastic.

486
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,500
oh, well, uh, thank you, howard.

487
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,700
more cheese?

488
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,500
have you tried the humboldt fog? it's quite good.

489
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,400
eleanor's right. enough business talk. right.

490
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,600
let's focus on our families' other joint venture-the union of our children.

491
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,837
i have to say, every time i look at anne's finger

492
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,950
and see blair's future engagement ring... yes.

493
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,200
i can hardly contain my joy. blair, why don't you try it on?

494
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,700
no, thank you. it's all right.

495
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,027
yes, i would like to see it. anne, give it to blair.

496
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,300
dad, she doesn't want to try on the ring.

497
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,700
howie,why don't we just let it alone?

498
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,700
just give it to the girl, anne.

499
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,000
eleanor, do we have another bottle?

500
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,000
if there was ever an occasion for the toast, this is it.

501
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,000
they're gonna make such a beautiful couple.

502
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,000
now come on. slide that thing on.

503
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,900
that's what i'm talking about, huh? oh, it's very pretty.

504
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,500
it looks magnificent to me. thank you.

505
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,400
everybody, yeah? yeah?

506
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,967
it's perfect on her. oh, now how about that toast? come on. everybody,

507
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,400
bottoms up.

508
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,914
dad, why don't we go smoke the cigars we got, huh? mm, mm. good idea.

509
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,700
excuse us. certainly.

510
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,400
this seat taken? father.

511
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
wow. the light of day doesn't do this place any justice.

512
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,600
i told him he had to check it out

513
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,700
when the joint was in full swing.

514
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,100
chuck, this is pauletta cho.

515
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,500
chuck bass. pleasure. all mine.

516
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,700
pauletta interviewed me for that recent piece in "the observer,"

517
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,700
roped me into a lunch yesterday to pitch me on the idea

518
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,600
of helping her with a career change. what can i say?

519
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,800
i'm tired of reporting on titans.

520
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,991
i wanna be one myself. right. well, uh, who better to help than my father?

521
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,800
as a test, i gave her your proposal

522
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,569
that i was given to take a look at.

523
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,000
the math was fine, but what interested me

524
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,500
was the wish fulfillment quality to the report.

525
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,200
so perhaps, some, uh, old-school thinking and fatherly bias clouded my judgment.

526
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,400
what do you say?

527
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,742
hmm?

528
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,600
i love the idea of being a patron of burgeoning talent.

529
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,600
shall we take a full tour?

530
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,400
yeah. you know, i've been trying to get ahold of lily,

531
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
but, uh, i don't seem able to.

532
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,500
uh, dad.

533
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,500
there's something i have to tell you.

534
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,100
dad, you have a problem. i don't have a problem.

535
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,900
you're tweaked and embarrassing.

536
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,100
you're trying to tell me you don't have a problem? don't be so dramatic.

537
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,600
no, you reminded me every day

538
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,353
how important this business deal is to you.

539
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,300
i mean, you've been selling me out trying to make it happen,

540
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,900
pushing me towards dartmouth, towards blair. you don't understand.

541
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,200
dad, you're totally sabotaging all of it tonight. hey,

542
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,773
who the hell are you to tell me?

543
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,000
i'm the adult. you're the kid.

544
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
i know.

545
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,500
i'm going back inside.

546
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,000
dad, don't.

547
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,700
nate, let go of me.

548
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,500
what's going on here? nothing. he's my son.

549
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,900
is everything all right?  i said everything's fine.

550
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,170
i'm not asking you.

551
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,780
sorry, dad. you need help.

552
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,100
check his pockets while you're at it.

553
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,500
all right, sir, just relax.

554
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,800
my father went home sick.

555
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,600
spotted on 5th avenue-- a father and son showdown.

556
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,500
too bad not all the witnesses can be bought off.

557
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,500
she's not taking my calls.

558
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,100
i can't believe you did this.

559
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,500
i made a mistake. this isn't high school, chuck.

560
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
i'm sure she'll take you back once you explain.

561
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,707
i'm not so certain about that.

562
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,700
if she doesn't, i'm not sure that's my fault.

563
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,000
there's a reason she was so quick to believe me.

564
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,300
there's a fire-eater in the ladies lounge.

565
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,900
you two should set a meeting,

566
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,200
see if this place can really be something.

567
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,400
i'm gonna try and find lily and fix this.

568
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,800
what are you doing?

569
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,500
i'm going to victrola.

570
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,500
i promised chuck. it's important to him.

571
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,500
i saw your father get arrested. why didn't you come to me?

572
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,400
i would've listened.

573
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,302
i've tried, blair.

574
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:34,800
but every time i try, something's got your attention--

575
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,200
a dinner party, you know, a masked ball.

576
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,100
yeah, let's talk about that masked ball.

577
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,000
let's talk about how while i was waiting for you to find me

578
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,400
so that we could finally be together,

579
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,900
you were confessing your feelings nd kissing serena.

580
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,900
i thought i was doing everything right. it's not your fault.

581
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,700
do you love me?

582
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,300
you should deal with your father.

583
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,733
he needs you.

584
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,300
you know what?

585
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,900
i don't.

586
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,100
okay, i'm ready.

587
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,300
may i?

588
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:27,800
i know it may not compare to, uh,

589
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,100
a suite at the ritz in paris or a chalet in aspen,

590
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,500
and it might be a fire hazard, but...

591
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,700
it's perfect.

592
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,900
where's nate?

593
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,900
i think we just broke up. what?

594
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,800
i don't want to talk about it. i just want to escape.

595
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,400
that's what this place is for, right?

596
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,100
i know you don't want to talk about what happened, but--

597
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,795
relief. i feel relief.

598
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,000
you know, i got moves.

599
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,300
really? then why don't you get up there?

600
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,300
no, i'm just saying, i have moves.

601
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,500
come on, you're ten times hotter than any of those girls.

602
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,400
i know what you're doing, bass.

603
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,800
you really don't think i'd go up there. i know you won't do it.

604
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
guard my drink.

605
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,400
who's that girl? i have no idea.

606
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,484
you go, baby vamp.

607
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,200
s you might have guessed, upper east siders,

608
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,393
prohibition never stood a chance against exhibition.

609
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,600
it's human nature to be free.

610
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,100
and no matter how long you try to be good,

611
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,500
you can't keep a bad girl down.

612
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,700
ell, this is a new strain of obsessive-compulsive.

613
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
the, uh, art piece projects up to the ceiling.

614
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,400
oh, still doing anything to get a girl on her back, huh?

615
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,100
what are you doing here, lil?

616
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,700
oh, uh-- let me ask you that question another way.

617
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,800
did you break up with bart again?

618
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,800
well, what did i do to deserve such a thorny welcome?

619
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,400
i'm sorry. i'm really not in the mood to play games.

620
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
i don't know what's happening with my wife or my marriage,

621
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,100
and you showing up here randomly and often

622
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,900
doesn't make figuring that out any easier.

623
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,400
i'm sorry i bothered you, really.

624
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,600
l, wait.

625
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,400
you know, if you wanna stay and see the, uh, installation,

626
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,900
i could really use the company.

627
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,900
oh, i don't want to be in your way.

628
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,500
since when, van der woodsen?

629
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
i'm really happy to be here with you right now.

630
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,800
wait.

631
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,700
what? what, did i do something wrong?

632
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,900
no. i knew the hair thing was too much.

633
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:16,900
no.

634
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,400
no, it's just, um...

635
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,400
um, "um" is never good. what?

636
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,100
i... i'm scared.

637
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,100
of me? no.

638
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,800
well, yes, but...

639
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,500
no, it's just-- i've never, um...

640
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,300
you've--you've never-- you're not...

641
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,700
no. all right.

642
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
no, i-i wish.

643
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,400
it's just, nobody's ever looked at me he way you just did.

644
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,300
in fact, i don't think they looked at me at all.

645
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,800
you think i'm crazy, don't you?

646
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,600
no. no, i don't.

647
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,700
are you mad?

648
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,600
come here.

649
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,900
thank you.

650
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,400
mom, hey.

651
00:39:08,551 --> 00:39:08,800
what's going on?

652
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,500
what do you think?

653
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,300
i'm headed down to the police station.

654
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:24,900
the lawyers will meet me there

655
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,100
along with someone from the district attorney's office.

656
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,700
wait, what? why can't we just pay his bail?

657
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,100
his bail is set at a million dollars.

658
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,600
what are you talking about? it wasn't even that much coke.

659
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,200
it seems your father is facing some other charges.

660
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,200
for what?

661
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,600
embezzlement and fraud.

662
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,100
i guess they've been building their case for a while.

663
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,500
well, are you coming?

664
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,100
mom...

665
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,700
it's time for you to come home.

666
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,300
thanks for the lift home.

667
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,200
you were... amazing up there.

668
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,200
are you sure?

669
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,700
