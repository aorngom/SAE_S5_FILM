00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,365
Gossip girl here
- Your one and only source

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,965
Into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,365
How's your mom doing? My
dad left her for another man.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,700
Something about uh-Uh, mom and a
neighbor? Yeah. It's complicated.

5
00:00:10,735 --> 00:00:12,400
Mom's having an affair.
It's easy for me to say it.

6
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:14,665
It happened one time,and it's over.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,900
Then why did our daughter have to
go to Hudson and drag you back here?

8
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,665
I'm sorry i kissed you,
but i did it because

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,200
I thought he should know
how it feels to lose you.

10
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:23,867
So when can we go public?

11
00:00:23,902 --> 00:00:25,465
My kids have to know first.

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,100
My friend Vanessa-She moved
away to vermont last year,

13
00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:29,065
And now she's back.

14
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,450
You guys just have
everything in common,

15
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:33,800
And, um, i'm just getting to know him.

16
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,865
This thing between us
- It's over fogood.

17
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,000
Nate is a gentleman. He
would never cause a scene.

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Where to, mr. Bass? The airport.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,100
And who am i?

20
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,600
That's a secret i'll never tell.

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,200
You know you love me.

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,500
Hey, upper east siders.
It's christmas in new york,

27
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:07,965
And along with the season

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,165
Comes the constance
billard/ st. Jude's bazaar,

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,900
Where the only thing bizarre
are the donated items for sale.

30
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:16,065
How about an antique butter churn?

31
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,400
Oh, my gosh. That would
go so well with my loom.

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,900
I know what i'm getting you
for christmas now. All right.

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,865
Oh, for when i move to siberia? No.

34
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,600
Come on. New york hardly
even gets cold anymore,

35
00:01:27,635 --> 00:01:29,665
And it never snows.

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,300
Who wants chestnuts roasted on an
open fire when it feels like florida?

37
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:33,965
Okay, global warming grinch.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm just saying, christmas
should be white and snowy.

39
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:40,100
I'd even settle for
Manhattan slush. Mm.

40
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
There you are.

41
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,900
Hey, Vanessa. What are
you doing here? Hey.

42
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:46,200
Merry christmas.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,265
This is a copy of "the new yorker. "

44
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,600
Thank you, but you know i
already have a subscription.

45
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:53,000
There's something else

46
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,500
What does it say, serena?

47
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,100
"Dear mr. Humphrey, we
are pleased to advise you

48
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:01,465
"That we would like to
publish your short story

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,465
In our summer fiction issue
featuring '20 under 20.'"

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,100
It's a contest for young unknown
writers, and i might have...

51
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:08,465
Oh, my god! Submitted you.

52
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,900
I'm gonna be published in
"the new yorker. " That-Oh.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
This ca-This can't be real.
Is-Is this-Is this real?

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,065
This is so great.

55
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,700
I haven't even read
one of your stories.

56
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:19,365
Oh, don't worry.?

57
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,500
I swiped this one out of his drawer
on the pretense of borrowing a stapler.

58
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:24,800
Slick. You never did return
that stapler, by the way.

59
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:25,565
Mnh-Mnh.

60
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,200
Let's see. You story
is called "10-8-05."

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,300
What's that date?

62
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,500
Vanessa, thank you. I
don't know how you did this,

63
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:38,665
But this is the best present ever.

64
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,900
* so hurry down the chimney tonight *

65
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,300
* hurry tonight *

66
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:46,100
* santa, baby *

67
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,165
I can't believe we
just took a cab for $32.

68
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,600
Well, i can't believe you were gonna
wait an hour for another subway.

69
00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:55,700
They said another train was on its way.

70
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,600
Uh, excuse me. Pardon me. Oh.

71
00:02:58,635 --> 00:03:01,600
Oh. Rufus, alison, hello.

72
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:02,165
Hi.

73
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,365
Oh, rufus.

74
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,700
Uh, you remember my
friend bartholomew bass?

75
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:09,567
Hi. From, uh, eleanor's? Yeah. Hello.

76
00:03:09,602 --> 00:03:12,400
Eleanor's? Oh, this is my wife alison.

77
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:13,800
Hi. How do you do?

78
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,300
Well, it's lovely to see you both.

79
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,300
Excuse us, please.

80
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,065
I guess lily's targeted
her next billionaire.

81
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,600
Actually, i think she's had
him in her sights for a while.

82
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,965
Well, that was awkward.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,100
It wouldn't be if you let people
know what we were doing together.

84
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,065
I'm just starting?

85
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,000
And the only reason you
didn't trust me last time

86
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:44,000
Was because of a misunderstanding.

87
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:45,265
Yes, and to avoid another one,

88
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,400
That if it doesn't work
out between us again,

89
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm gonna feel twice as humiliated.

90
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,000
Not telling people about us
ensures that we don't work out.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,700
Look, when i committed
myself to you, i meant it.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You know i am in love with you.

93
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,800
What are you waiting for?

94
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,800
Blair.

95
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,365
Oh, happy holidays.

96
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,265
Happy holidays-Mwah-
Ms. Van der woodsen.

97
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,800
Mr. Bass, i didn't think
that you were still in town.

98
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:12,265
I figured that you were
with... with charles? No. Sadly,

99
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,900
I am stuck here on business while he
suns himself at my hotel in monaco.

100
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,100
I have my staff keeping an eye on him,

101
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:19,500
And i'll join him for new year's.

102
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,565
Oh, right. I
- I, uh, was wondering

103
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,400
Why he'd been so quiet, and
monaco answers my question.

104
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:26,965
Yeah.

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Lovely to see you two. Bye. You, too.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,400
Blair, there you are.

107
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,700
I- I can't talk right now,
serena. I'm late, and i have-

108
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:47,065
A huge sweet tooth?

109
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,800
They're for my dad and
me. We get them every year,

110
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:51,600
And he landed om parar 27 minutes ago.

111
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:53,900
Oh, then vite, vite!?

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,400
Come on. I said vite!

113
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,300
Hey!

114
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,165
Nice holiday spirit, scrooge!

115
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,800
Oh, gosh. So it's gonna be
a real waldorf christmas?

116
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:06,617
Well, a real waldorf christmas eve.

117
00:05:06,652 --> 00:05:08,376
Eleanor drew the line at christmas day.

118
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:10,100
That's only for me, her and dorota.

119
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:11,565
Well, you still have?

120
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,400
No, it'll be more than
just a couple days.

121
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:15,200
I'm gonna convince him
to stay in new york.

122
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:16,965
What about paris and roman?

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,600
Roman is a phase. My
father belongs here with me.

124
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:22,200
He only left new york to
ride out the scandal. Oh!

125
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,850
Time to come home, don't you think?

126
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:25,200
Hey, did you want to ask me something?

127
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:27,365
Yes, a gift idea for dan?

128
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,365
The most thoughtful
dan-Like present ever.

129
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,300
Why don't you just buy
him? And call it a day?

130
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:35,200
Thank you for being
totally not helpful at all.

131
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
See you tomorrow night.

132
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,900
Bye.

133
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,000
Hi! Blair-Bear!

134
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh! Oh, look at you.

135
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,900
Mm. More beautiful than ever.

136
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,900
Uh, sweetheart, you remember roman?

137
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,100
Blair.

138
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,565
Ah. Mm.

139
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
You are still perfection.

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,400
Delicate, yet full with flavor,

141
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,600
Like a macaron.

142
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,800
Imagine my surprise when
the elevator door opened

143
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:14,300
And out popped both of 'em.

144
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,065
Well, i didn't think you'd mind.

145
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,300
It's the perfect opportunity for you
two to get to know each another better.

146
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,465
Absolutely. It's for you.

147
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,900
Oh, sweetheart, you remembered.

148
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:25,800
It, uh, our tradition.

149
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,500
That's for you.

150
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Merci, blair.

151
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,300
My pleasure.

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
My son, the writer.

153
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,265
(Alison) published writer.

154
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,400
Yeah, you got your dream girl and
your story in "the new yorker. "

155
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:47,500
(Jenny) maybe you should just die now.

156
00:06:47,535 --> 00:06:49,700
That's true. I may have peaked.

157
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,700
This one is from the smiths.

158
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,265
"Season's greetings. "
That's very original.

159
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,300
Their name's smith. They
don't have to be original.

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,700
This one is from, uh, alex.

161
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:01,265
What?

162
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,300
"Alison, meet-Meet me on
the 24th for-" No, dan.

163
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,800
And that's not a christmas card.

164
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,300
(Lowered voice) why
is he writing to you?

165
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,000
Sending cards to the
house? Asking to see you?

166
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,300
I don't kn. W

167
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
Guys, we're-We're still
here. We can hear you.

168
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,600
Rufus, it's over with alex, okay?

169
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:37,700
I- I-I'm home now
with my family.

170
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,700
Good.

171
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,700
Let's all rewind and just pretend
this never happened. (Clears throat)

172
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:48,800
This is not gonna
ruin our Christmas.

173
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,500
I can't believe you're okay with
this. Who said i am okay with this?

174
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,665
What am i supposed to do, make a scene?

175
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,700
Behave like some
pathetic, scorned wife? No.

176
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,700
(Speaks french) roman does
not even know how to ice-Skate.

177
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:14,365
Can't you escort him out of the park

178
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,900
On your way to the meeting?
Maybe drop him at a nail salon?

179
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:21,400
I cannot bother myself trying
to wrestle roman away from you.

180
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,700
I have to mentally prepare.

181
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,100
I am meeting with the C.E.O.
Of victoria's secret, after all.

182
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,265
Victoria's secret?

183
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,565
Yes, i'm- I'm
designing a line

184
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,900
Of retro-Chic sleepwear
and lingerie and i-

185
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:35,317
I'm looking forward to the samples.

186
00:08:35,352 --> 00:08:36,665
We're all very proud.

187
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,100
In fact, mom, why don't
you tell roman all about it?

188
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:39,865
Oh, yes.

189
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,200
I'm sure he'd be fascinated.

190
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,950
It's so good to have you here.
Well, it's good to be here.

191
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:47,400
Now where's the handsome Nate?
Am i gonna see him tonight?

192
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:49,465
Well, he's in connecticut with his mum.

193
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,765
He said he would try to catch a train

194
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,500
And make it to the party
tonight. Yeah, well,

195
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,600
Another New York 
institution that i miss.

196
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,800
You know, you don't
have to miss any of it.

197
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,100
I wish that i could be
in two places at once,

198
00:09:02,135 --> 00:09:04,500
My dear, but impossible. Sorry.

199
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,100
You know that chateau near
lyon that i told you about?

200
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:10,300
Mm-Hmm. Roman and i bought it.

201
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,800
You bought that place? Yes.

202
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,500
And with roman?

203
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,100
The house is flooded with light.

204
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,700
The fireplaces are big enough.
I mean, you can walk into them.

205
00:09:19,735 --> 00:09:22,100
The gardens are incroyable.

206
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,800
Uh, pardon me. I'm
taking my niece skating,

207
00:09:26,835 --> 00:09:29,300
And i can't seem to locate the rink.

208
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,100
But it's- It's
right over there.

209
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Of course. The throng
of children in mittens

210
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:37,500
Should have tipped me off. Thank you.

211
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,500
You're welcome.

212
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,700
The handsome man was
just flirting with you.

213
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,900
That's absurd. He was
not flirting with me.

214
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,300
Roman, it is going to be so dull for you

215
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:57,765
To sit and watch them skate.

216
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,700
Yes. Why don't you go to the petting zoo

217
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:00,800
And feed the sheep?

218
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,900
Or why don't i join you
on the rink? It looks fun.

219
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,450
Wonderful.

220
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:06,665
Yes. Super.

221
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
I'll get you skates. See you there.

222
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,900
Super.

223
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,000
You're not autographing those
and selling them on ebay,are you?

224
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:26,165
No. No, no.

225
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
I'm just checking out some
of the previous publishees,

226
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,600
And i'm-I'm in great company
here. It'sthe new yorker. "

227
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:34,865
V., how can i top this?
I can't, really,

228
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,900
Unless i rig the oscars for
one of your documentaries.

229
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:38,065
You got in on your own merit.

230
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,000
The only gift i gave you was
to lick a stamp, and as for me,

231
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:44,317
The annual Dan Humphrey
christmas cd mix

232
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,600
Is more than enough. All right, yeah.

233
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,200
Hey.

234
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,900
What's in the bag? Perfection.

235
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,500
Look, i know it's not christmas
yet, but open it, please.

236
00:10:58,535 --> 00:11:00,000
I can't wait. I'm too excited.

237
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Oh, my.

238
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,265
I noticed the other day
that you don't wear a watch,

239
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,500
And then it occurred to me it's
because you don't have a watch,

240
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:12,700
And you're gonna need one to
be punctual for all the meetings

241
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:15,100
With editors and publishers
now that you're a fancy

242
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:18,100
And apparently, self-Important writer.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,600
You don't like it. You
want the brown band.

244
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:24,500
No, no, no. I love the band.

245
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:25,565
I love the whole thing.

246
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,000
It's-It's the most amazing
watch i've ever seen,

247
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,800
But i can't accept this.

248
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:32,600
What? Oh, yes, you can.

249
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,265
Look, it's more of a gift for me

250
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,500
Because i had so much fun
picking it out for you.

251
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:37,565
You have to.

252
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,750
Serena, i buy a book for
my dad every christmas.

253
00:11:39,785 --> 00:11:42,492
I think the most elaborate
gift i've ever given

254
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:45,200
Has been a pair of rubber
boots from I.L. Bean.

255
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,200
So then i overdid it?

256
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,500
I think even your underdoing it

257
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,300
Would be overdoing it.

258
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,400
Look, um, let's-Let's-
Let's set some rules,

259
00:11:57,435 --> 00:11:58,900
Maybe some helpful guidelines.

260
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,500
Fine.

261
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Deadline?

262
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,100
Um, tomorrow morning.

263
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:07,200
Price limit?

264
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,700
50 bucks.

265
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,300
All right. May the best gift win.

266
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,400
(Lowered voice) hey, um... hey.

267
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,300
If it's any help, i can tell you
dan's favorite used book shop.

268
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,200
That's okay. I think i got it.

269
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,100
Are you alex? Who are you?

270
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:46,200
Rufus humphrey.

271
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,150
Unless you want to be
carried out of here,

272
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,800
You're gonna stay the
hell away from my wife.

273
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:51,665
Calm down now.

274
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,500
You sent a letter to my wife

275
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,600
At my house where my children live?

276
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,400
Whatever you had with her is over.

277
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,500
Why don't you sit down? She
told you to leave her alone.

278
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,900
I'm sorry.

279
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,900
That's not what she told
me a couple days ago.

280
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Excuse me. You...

281
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,800
You spoke to her?

282
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,600
(Mcguire sisters) * "c"
is for the candy trim *

283
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:22,100
* around the christmas tree *

284
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,765
* "h" is for the happiness *

285
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,500
Damn it. You can do it. You can do it.

286
00:13:26,535 --> 00:13:27,465
Look at all these children.

287
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,700
They're skating around
fearlessly. Come on.

288
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:31,917
They got a lot shorter way to fall.

289
00:13:31,952 --> 00:13:34,065
Blair, will you help us here?

290
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,900
Just a second. My laces came undone.

291
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Only 1 question:how did
you fake ur virginity for n?

292
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,465
(Harold) now here we go.

293
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,800
Ready? Now go to blair. Okay.

294
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:49,000
You can do it! Blair!

295
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,000
Come give us a lesson.

296
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,565
Spotted spinning
at wollman rink-

297
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,400
The blair capades. All the
grace of nancy kerrigan,

298
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:59,900
But packing the punch of tonya harding.

299
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,600
(Harold) pauvre roman.

300
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,400
a va?

301
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,365
Are you all right?

302
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,800
I'm so clumsy. My foot got
caught behind the skate. Oh.

303
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:15,100
(Harold) oh. Here. Let me help you.

304
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,831
(Elevator bell dings) i cannot believe

305
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:26,300
that daddy decided to stay with roman

306
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:28,400
Instead of having tea
at the carlyle with me.

307
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,200
The E.R. Doctor said he
would make a full recovery.

308
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,165
Everything is ruined.

309
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,000
Why wod you say that? You
and i had a marvelous time.

310
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:40,065
Well, i'm sorry, mother.
It's just not the same.

311
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,365
I don't understand how that
french fox stole my father

312
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,120
And your husband and always seems

313
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:47,100
to come off like a-an innocent lamb.

314
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:49,500
Roman was not always
so innocent, you know.

315
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,765
Really? What's his story?

316
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,865
Mm, well, when i first met him,

317
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,800
He was going out with
this model named freddy,

318
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:58,700
And freddy was a horrible scoundrel.

319
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:00,365
Roman would actually?

320
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,100
Into him? He was-He was
absolutely infatuated with him.

321
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,765
Freddy had him under
some kind of spell.

322
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,565
I was the one who got
him to break out of it

323
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,300
And turn his life around. Don't
mention freddy to your father.

324
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:10,565
It is a sore subject.

325
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,400
Okay. What was freddy's last name?

326
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,665
Hey. Where were you?

327
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,700
I tried to call you,
but your phone was off.

328
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,000
I kept your date for you with alex.

329
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,865
He's actually a pretty cool guy

330
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,900
Other than the fact that
he's in love with my wife.

331
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,100
He told me about your phone call.

332
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,600
He... felt that i owed
him an explanation,

333
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:52,200
And he was right.

334
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,300
And you didn't tell me that because...

335
00:15:54,335 --> 00:15:56,000
Because there was nothing to tell.

336
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,900
I told alex that i
was back with my family

337
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
And to stop calling.

338
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,700
Would you have come back...

339
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,800
If jenny hadn't shown up to bring you?

340
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,100
If i hadn't, would
lily be here right now?

341
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,700
I guess by turning our
backs on these other people,

342
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,500
We thought we could fix ourselves.

343
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,800
Maybe other people aren't the problem.

344
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,800
Maybe we changed.

345
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,600
And at what point do we admit

346
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,400
That no matter how much we
want it or how hard we try...

347
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,900
It'sujt t not rking.

348
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
I know it's been maybe ten
minutes since i last asked,

349
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:53,200
But are you still sure you
don't want to talk about it?

350
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,765
Dad said he didn't want?

351
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,000
That's what i'm trying to do.

352
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,650
Hey, well, just in case?

353
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,800
You're here. I know.

354
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,065
Okay. How about this?

355
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,900
At least you know it's
something serena doesn't have.

356
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:09,700
A year of cheese for $600?
Are these people kidding?

357
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,400
I could buy a cow for that much

358
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:12,500
money and make my own cheese.

359
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:14,408
You just said "make my own cheese. "

360
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,500
That's disgusting.

361
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,300
I'm never gonna find this
gift for serena.

362
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:18,765
Yeah, and your gift needs to be?

363
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,465
To make up for the
rest of her christmas.

364
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,124
What do you mean?

365
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,300
Well,she's living in a hotel.

366
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:23,700
You know, how homey can it be?

367
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:24,965
It's not exactly festive.

368
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Eric told me they
don't even allow trees.

369
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,100
(Chuck) leave a message,
and i might listen. (Beep)

370
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,065
(Scoffs) chuck, you are
not answering my calls,

371
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,968
To torture me, i am sure, but

372
00:17:38,969 --> 00:17:40,900
please, for the love of god,

373
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,600
Do not tell anybody about us, okay?

374
00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:45,965
Please? Please.

375
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,200
Hey. You told me to come right away.

376
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:48,567
Is everything all right? Yeah.

377
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:49,900
Why aren't you with your dad?

378
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,400
Uh, i need your log-In?

379
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:54,500
From your modeling days.

380
00:17:54,535 --> 00:17:55,565
My modeling days?

381
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
I did one print ad
for gap when i was 12.

382
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,280
What,are you holding an
open call or something?

383
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,490
I have one specific look in mind.

384
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,100
Uh,okay,well i don't know

385
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,930
If it'll still even be in here,but...

386
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,310
Well,look at that.

387
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,000
Addresses and phone numbers. Perfect.

388
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,760
You know,i called you an
hour ago. B.T.W.,you're late.

389
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,430
Um,you're lucky i'm even here at all.

390
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,618
It's christmas eve,and i still

391
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:23,700
haven't found a gift for dan.

392
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,180
Now all the stores are closing,
and i'm totally screwed.

393
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,210
Do you have any idea what you can buy

394
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,515
For under $50 these
days? I don't know.

395
00:18:30,516 --> 00:18:32,660
A single entrיe at a
mid-Priced restaurant?

396
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,540
Three-Quarters of a dvd box set?

397
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,660
Maybe a pair of wolford stockings.

398
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,550
Oh,stockings. Yes,great idea for dan.

399
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,720
Blair,please, this is serious.

400
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,040
I don't know. Why don't you
buy him a gold money clip

401
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,592
From cartier,say it's $49.99?

402
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:47,080
He won't know the difference.

403
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,990
What are you doing anyway?

404
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,700
I'm booking me a model.

405
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,430
Hey.

406
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,370
I come to you hat in
hand, tail between my legs

407
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,510
And off my high horse. (Chuckles)

408
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,220
I spent the entire day searching
for the perfect gift for dan.

409
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,440
Now all the stores are closing,
christmas day is looming,

410
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,790
And,um... i need your help.

411
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,250
I could take this opportunity to gloat,

412
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,970
But i actually like you.

413
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,812
So let's get down to business.

414
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:36,270
What do you have so far?

415
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,000
Um,i found a first
edition J. L. Hall book,

416
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,550
Original italian poster
of the "400 blows"

417
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,167
And a montblanc fountain pen

418
00:19:43,168 --> 00:19:44,940
All very thoughtful.

419
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,570
And all exceed $50.

420
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,770
Right.

421
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,470
Well,dan's not really that into things.

422
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,250
Which makes shopping
for him kind of hopeless.

423
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,280
The only thing he wants
for christmas is snow.

424
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,640
It's not like i can give him that.

425
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,590
You sure?

426
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,780
(Eleanor) happy holidays.

427
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,970
Welcome. Welcome.

428
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,200
(Lily) oh! Hi. Hi. Hi. I
don't know if you've noticed.

429
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,290
We're doing things a little
untraditionally this year.

430
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,840
I don't know if you've heard.

431
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,990
I'm desiining a ne of
lingerie for victoria's secret.

432
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,610
I walked into the store,and
i fell in love with this tree.

433
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,750
Isn't that lipstick clever? Isn't it?

434
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,390
Good. Have some eggnog.

435
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,070
Hello? (Rufus) hey. It's me.

436
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,260
Hey. So,uh,running into each
other at the school fair-

437
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,370
Kind of awkward.

438
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,690
I suppose so,especially
after our last phone call.

439
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,040
Rufus,we really shouldn't be speaking.

440
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,980
No,i know.

441
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,440
But if there's something
you want to say,

442
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,390
You should go ahead and say it

443
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,800
Is there something you want me to say?

444
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,360
Rufus...

445
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,310
Why are you calling?

446
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,540
Oh,i...

447
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,640
Just wanted to say merry christmas.

448
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,950
Hope you have a good holiday.

449
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,170
Yes,well...

450
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:18,010
I'm,um,flying to anguilla
with bart tonight,

451
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,840
So i'm expecting it to
be a-A great holiday-

452
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,000
One for the ages,in fact.

453
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,090
Good night,rufus. Good-Bye.

454
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,800
(Whispers) anguilla.

455
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,860
What is the matter with me?

456
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,790
(Laughs) i don't think so. Oh.

457
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,680
Oh. Excuse me.

458
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,608
What are you doing here?

459
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:47,490
Well,i was hoping to see you again.

460
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,897
I thought it great good fortune

461
00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:50,050
that roman tracked me down

462
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,670
At the skating rink and
extended an invitation.

463
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,470
Oh,well...

464
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,590
En-Enjoy
the party.

465
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:58,625
Hmm.

466
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,960
How dare you invite a
strange man into my home.

467
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,470
Jack came?

468
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,650
Go talk to him.

469
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,180
Bring vodka. Roman...

470
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,352
(Whispers) you practically

471
00:22:12,353 --> 00:22:13,570
picked him up off the street.

472
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,670
And then i googled him.
His name is jack roth.

473
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,780
He owns a prominent hedge fund

474
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,200
With offices in london and barcelona,

475
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,340
And he finds you very attractive.

476
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,930
Well,that's no excuse,

477
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,570
And-And-And i
am doing just fine

478
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,330
Without your romantic help.

479
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,640
Are you?

480
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,300
Eleanor,we've been
friends for a long time...

481
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,920
Since before marc
jacobs went into rehab.

482
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,920
Friends don't steal
other friends' husbands.

483
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,300
Is nate there?

484
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,630
Oh. A few hours ago?

485
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,010
Chuck bass didn't call for him, did he?

486
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,789
Uh,never mind. Did nate

487
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,570
say where he was going?

488
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,800
No,no. Don't-Don
disturbrb mrs. Archibald.

489
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,010
Um,i'm sure he's on his way here now.

490
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,400
All right. Thank you.

491
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,779
Dorota's gonna kill you if

492
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,200
you get glue on that comforter.

493
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,385
Sorry we've turned your

494
00:23:12,386 --> 00:23:13,500
room into an art studio,b.,

495
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,410
But the clock is
ticking. (Computer beeps)

496
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,100
I'm done.

497
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,450
(Laughs) oh,my gosh.

498
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,770
Wow. That-That's
amazing.

499
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,626
Thank you so much,vanessa.

500
00:23:29,627 --> 00:23:31,970
This is gonna be... incredible.

501
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,180
Good. I'm glad i could help.

502
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,590
I think he'll really love it.

503
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,150
Vanessa?

504
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,370
I think i'd like to help
with this little project.

505
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,770
Would you come and help me

506
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:49,960
find another pair of scissors?

507
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,040
It's so nice what you're
doing for your friend dan,

508
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,020
Helping his girlfriend
make his christmas present.

509
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,100
Serena is so grateful

510
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,780
Because she likes to
see the best in people.

511
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,300
I like to see the truth.

512
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,730
Yeah? And what's that?

513
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,440
I think you like dan a little too much.

514
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,640
Just thought i should let you know

515
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,770
Someone's watching.

516
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,120
Merry christmas.

517
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,560
I'm taking off. Call
me when you're done?

518
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,980
Okay. Where you going?

519
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,860
I'm gonna go check
on my daddy. I thought

520
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,190
You were gonna help?

521
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,510
I think my work's done here.
Oh,hello.

522
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,320
Hi. Good-Bye. When you two

523
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:48,980
are done hiding up here,

524
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,386
I'm taking you both out for

525
00:24:50,387 --> 00:24:51,840
dessert. Can't,mom. I'm busy.

526
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,370
But this is important for our family.

527
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,376
It'll just be the three

528
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:55,430
of us. Mom,anytime you say

529
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,765
It means you're dating

530
00:24:56,766 --> 00:24:58,340
someone new. Whoever it is,

531
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,524
I don't care. I'll just meet

532
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:02,860
him at the wedding. Fine,fine.

533
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,650
Then i will just tell you who it is,

534
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,810
Because you're gonna be

535
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:07,230
seeing him around from now on.

536
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,460
It's Bart Bass.
(Eric and serena) Bart Bass?

537
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,610
Mom,you cannot date bart bass.

538
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,386
You just said a moment ago you didn't

539
00:25:15,387 --> 00:25:16,880
care who it was. That was before

540
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,340
He only has one facial
expression. He scares me.

541
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,920
And he raised chuck.
That scares me.

542
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,070
Oh,serena,as usual, you're
being overly dramatic.

543
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,250
I'm not marrying Bart.

544
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,480
This is very casual,

545
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,420
And regardless,i'm not
asking your permission.

546
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,260
You know when i suggested this plan,

547
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,656
I didn't know that it would

548
00:25:43,657 --> 00:25:45,120
entail a robbery. Hey,hey,hey.

549
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,200
I left a donation,

550
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,180
So it was more of a
rescue than a robbery.

551
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,760
You know,those abandoned
trees in that lot

552
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,140
Were just gonna be kindling
the day after christmas,

553
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,638
And this tree that we have here

554
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,040
is gonna be loved and admired.

555
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,556
Oh,yeah,you have a real talent

556
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:57,840
for spin,my brother. Okay.

557
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,240
I wish i had more talent
for heavy lifting. Oh.

558
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,279
Oh. Yeah,well,what you're doing

559
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,240
for serena is really romantic.

560
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,080
I wonder what mom and dad

561
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,270
Are getting each
other for christmas.

562
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,580
I thought that if i got
them under the same roof

563
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,750
That things would go
back to the way they were.

564
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,080
They haven't,have they?

565
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,110
I think there's a real possibility

566
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,220
That they might split up.

567
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,360
If i hadn't brought her back, though,

568
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,550
We could've just kept pretending

569
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,160
That she's just in Hudson
doing her art.

570
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,160
You did the right thing, jen.

571
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,640
Really,you did, 'cause
whatever happens now,

572
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:49,180
At least,uh,we're not
living in a fantasy,you know?

573
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,260
Wonderful party,eleanor.

574
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,090
So you... ice-Skate?

575
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,200
Occasionally, with my niece,

576
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,190
But she's much more talented than i am.

577
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,280
(Clears throat) well, i
haven't skated since ages,

578
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,740
But i used to love it when i was a girl.

579
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,375
You must have been very beautiful out

580
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:20,020
there on the ice. (Elevator bell dings)

581
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
Oh,thank you.

582
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,710
Excuse me.

583
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,600
Merry christmas. Merry christmas.

584
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,510
(Chuckles) excuse me.

585
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,246
Freddy,what on earth are you

586
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:34,160
doing here? Oh,roman invited me.

587
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,360
(Eleanor) what?

588
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,700
Freddy,what... what are you doing here?

589
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,910
He said that you invited him. What?

590
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,930
Freddy.

591
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,350
Roman,explain this.

592
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,170
I can't.

593
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,283
And so true. How does one

594
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:52,770
explain the indescribable pull

595
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,280
To see an old lover,to feel
that jolt of electricity?

596
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,899
So you couldn't last two days

597
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,560
in town without contacting him?

598
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:03,720
I can't believe you'd trust
appearances and not me.

599
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:13,270
Harold,dear,i- Roman
did not invite freddy.

600
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,800
I think blair did.

601
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,760
Blair?

602
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,140
Freddy...

603
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,153
If you want to be the featured

604
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:26,800
model in my spring catalog,

605
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,940
You'd better tell us the truth.

606
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,340
She might have offered
to buy me a cruise...

607
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,280
Oh.

608
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,960
And renew my gym membership.

609
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,400
(Chuckles) well,you might
as well take that cruise,

610
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,000
Because you'll be
featured in my catalog

611
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,280
When hell freezes over.

612
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,590
Now please,get out.
Thanks for the champagne.

613
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,940
Merry christmas.

614
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,770
Looks like daddy's little girl

615
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,890
Isn't sugar and spice and
everything nice after all.

616
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,870
I wish you would just
slow down for a second

617
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,070
And let her be. Well,i
just can't believe

618
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,400
That blair would do something so cruel,

619
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,490
And roman,who's only ever
been completely kind to her.

620
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,960
It isn't roman blair's
lashing out at-It's you.

621
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,590
She was so looking forward to
spending time with you alone,

622
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,550
And then you show up at our
doorstep with your lover,

623
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,230
Without a word of warning. How
did you expect her to react?

624
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,700
Well,i hoped that once
we were together,

625
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,540
It would all work out.

626
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,400
I suppose that was pretty naive.

627
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,680
Blair learned scheming from her mother

628
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,620
And unrealistic
dreaming from her father.

629
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,100
She tries really hard
to act all grown-Up,

630
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,840
But don't you be fooled.

631
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,380
She's still a little
girl who needs her daddy.

632
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,630
(Grunts) okay,stop,stop,stop. Ow.

633
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,450
Okay. What now?

634
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,140
Now you go in there,

635
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,490
You distract dexter, the
humorless concierge... okay.

636
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,491
While i try and sneak this into an

637
00:30:08,492 --> 00:30:10,450
elevator. All right,um,who's gonna

638
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,974
So you can carry this thing by

639
00:30:11,975 --> 00:30:13,780
yourself? (Groans) i did-I did not say

640
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,090
this plan is fool-proofed,

641
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,440
(Jenny) yeah.

642
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,890
Hey,Ms. Van der
woods- Lily,hi.

643
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,790
Dan. Jenny. Tree. Hi.

644
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:27,480
Yeah,um,they don't allow
christmas trees inside,

645
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,160
Which is why we're out here.

646
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,580
Which is why dan's about
to ask you for a favor.

647
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,690
Ah,does it involve distracting dexter

648
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,119
And sneaking into the elevator

649
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,130
Why? Would that work?

650
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,130
No. Never. He has the eyes of a hawk,

651
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,800
And he takes his job very seriously.

652
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,930
So i've noticed.

653
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,810
But bobby at the
service entrance-

654
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,410
I think he could be bought.

655
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,250
Come.

656
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,440
I just sent him a text, and
dan's on his way. (Squeals)

657
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,250
Thank you so much.
It's really no problem,

658
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,960
And since there are no
problems,i should go.

659
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,470
Oh,no,no,no. Stay,please.

660
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,570
You don't need me. We talked
about how to turn everything on.

661
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,390
No,i know i can do it,but i
just want you to see dan's face.

662
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,339
I've really gotta get going.

663
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,310
Okay. Well,i'll tell
him how much you did.

664
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,520
Please don't. It's your present.

665
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,130
Just... enjoy your night.

666
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,842
(Nate) hey,this is nate.

667
00:31:33,843 --> 00:31:35,290
I can't come to the phone (Beep)

668
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,400
Can i come in?

669
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,010
Our flight leaves in a few hours.

670
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,960
I wanted to say good-Bye.

671
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,950
Please forgive me,blair.

672
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,190
I should have told you
that i was bringing roman.

673
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,204
I knew that having him

674
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,290
here would be hard for you,

675
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,910
But i love you so
much, and i love roman,

676
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,366
And i was hoping that if

677
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:02,010
we were all thrown together,

678
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,900
That something... perfect would happen

679
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,110
And that you would love him,too.

680
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,943
I was gonna convince you

681
00:32:09,944 --> 00:32:11,690
to move back to new york,

682
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,440
But you bought a vineyard

683
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,080
In france with roman.

684
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,730
What's next, a commitment ceremony?

685
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,240
(Scoffs) great.

686
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,380
There's no room in your
life for me anymore.

687
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,930
Sweetheart, there is
always room for you.

688
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,192
No matter where i am,

689
00:32:32,193 --> 00:32:34,480
no matter who i'm with.

690
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,240
I,uh...

691
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,410
This is part of your christmas gift.

692
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,380
(Blair) yourouse in france.

693
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,490
It's very nice,daddy.

694
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,870
I'm sure you and roman
will totally enjoy it.

695
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,650
And so will you,

696
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,230
Because this... (gasps)

697
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,220
Is your room.

698
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,140
* i hardly believed it at all *

699
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,390
It's beautiful.

700
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,050
We're having it decorated just for you.

701
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,470
(Chuckles) a cat.

702
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,500
A cat named "cat," like
in your favorite movie.

703
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,240
It was roman's idea.

704
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,590
* plants and animals *

705
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,680
So... merry christmas, sweetheart.

706
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:31,911
We're hoping that you'll

707
00:33:31,912 --> 00:33:33,150
spend the whole summer with us.

708
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,560
* was coming on *

709
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,250
* only for *

710
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,830
* you *

711
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,280
Merry christmas.

712
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,740
Do you like it? Do
you think it's cheesy?

713
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,930
No.

714
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,220
No,no, it's-It's
incredible.

715
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,600
How did you do this?

716
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,340
Well, i had help from my elves.

717
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,060
* that i know *

718
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,040
* and running a blender
in a lightning storm *

719
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:16,470
* disguised as a blessing, i'm sure *

720
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,750
Your present is waiting
for you at home,

721
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:23,720
But,um,i did bring a
little pre-Present for you.

722
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,110
* up here *

723
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,790
* there comes a fork in the road *

724
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,760
* the pants have gotta go *

725
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,660
Wait. This is your story.
Yeah,it's the original.

726
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,740
It's right out of the spiral notebook.

727
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,580
I'm kinda scared to read it.

728
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,720
What happened on october 8th,2005?

729
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,970
Well, i was accidentally invited

730
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,660
To a birthday party where i met a girl.

731
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,930
She only spoke two sentences to me,

732
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,180
But i've never forgotten her.

733
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,470
Wait. Your story's about me?

734
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,990
* gna wash my bones *

735
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,840
* in the atlantic shore *

736
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,850
* only for *

737
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,630
* you and me *

738
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,990
Are we really gonna do this?

739
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,400
Yeah.

740
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,830
The arts and crafts were impressive,

741
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,320
But how did you manage the real snow?

742
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,220
I'm well-Connected. (Laughs)

743
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,350
This is,without question,
the best christmas ever.

744
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,610
Ever in the history of christmas.

745
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,510
I hate to break the spell,

746
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,501
But,uh,we better get home

747
00:36:22,502 --> 00:36:24,710
before our families wake up.

748
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,830
(Whispers) eleanor... hmm?

749
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,500
You are a marvel.

750
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,860
Oh,stop it. Mmm.

751
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,790
(Whispering) who knew
there were men like you

752
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,020
Wandering around central
park,lost? (Laughs)

753
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,020
(Normal voice) oh.

754
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,720
Eleanor,good morning,

755
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,020
And,jack,nice to see you. Good morning.

756
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,030
Yes,wonderful.

757
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,022
The flights were all canceled

758
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:53,050
because of the weather.

759
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,300
I wanted to tell blair in person.

760
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,252
Do not worry.

761
00:36:55,253 --> 00:36:57,500
We-We have a room at the pierre.

762
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,190
No,it's nonsense.
You-You'll stay with us.

763
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,200
Thank you.

764
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,040
You'll call me later?

765
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,320
Oh,yes.

766
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,280
I'll be spending christmas
with my... family.

767
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,550
Bye.

768
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,150
What's going on?

769
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,910
We're back for christmas.

770
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,100
Well,roman, you are in for a treat,

771
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,180
Because a waldorf
christmas is like no other.

772
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,520
Come on,you.

773
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,620
Oh.

774
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,350
Whew. Merry christmas,dad.
You're up early.

775
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,210
And you're getting in awfully late.
Oh,yeah,well,

776
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,320
I left you a message.

777
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,150
Saying the tree shenanigans
were taking all night,

778
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,740
But i didn't think you
meant literally all night.

779
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,775
Oh. Yeah... yeah,the tree.

780
00:38:02,776 --> 00:38:04,670
It was a big production.

781
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,227
Uh,luckily serena's mom was

782
00:38:06,228 --> 00:38:07,790
there to help with the plan.

783
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,840
Lily was there?

784
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,104
I thought you mentioned she was out

785
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:13,400
of the country. No. No,they're here.

786
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,700
They're gonna go see
"the nutcracker" tomorrow.

787
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,460
Do i smell Chocolate chip waffles?

788
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,900
(Rufus) with hot caramel
sauce. Your father's

789
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,150
Christmas specialty.

790
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,050
Good morning. (Giggles)
after breakfast and presents,

791
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,340
I need to go to the
gallery... (alison) mm.

792
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:30,900
To take care of some
stuff. On christmas morning?

793
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,990
Well,yeah,you know, art never sleeps.

794
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:33,624
But you know what?

795
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:34,830
The three of us could hang out together.

796
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,370
It'll be great. We'll drink
hot cocoa and watch a movie,

797
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,891
And then when your dad comes

798
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:41,470
back,we can all go for a walk.

799
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,124
Hear those silver bells?

800
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,360
It's christmas time in the city.

801
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,350
Some families actually
do make the yuletide gay,

802
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,090
Managing to leave their
troubles far away...

803
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,030
Mom. Oh,it's beautiful.
Thank you. Thank you.

804
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,970
Oh,look. You look like a
brunette catherine deneuve.

805
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,560
Quelle magnifique.
(Blair) it's so gorgeous.

806
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,270
Merry christmas,dorota.
It's so we can text.

807
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,630
Do you like it? Thank you,miss blair.

808
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,190
Other families have a
merry little christmas

809
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,090
Even when their troubles
aren't so far away...

810
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,490
So what did dad have to
do at the gallery,exactly?

811
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,510
Uh,paperwork,i-I think.

812
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:27,590
(The weepies) * carols
'cross the water *

813
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,840
You're going back to
Hudson, aren't you?

814
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,390
* all that i want *

815
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,310
Yeah.

816
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,640
* all that i want *

817
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:41,020
But,hey, we are gonna be okay.

818
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,450
Come here.

819
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,530
* above the rooftops *

820
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,000
We know.

821
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:48,910
I'm sorry.

822
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,640
* golden spoon *

823
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:54,120
* i wait on clip-Clops *

824
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,010
Some presents might end
up getting returned...

825
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,810
I know how you like florida.

826
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,750
Yeah. Wow.

827
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,810
Uh,number one fan.

828
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,860
You know,i'm-I'm sorry i
didn't get anything for you,

829
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,189
Mr. Bass,but,uh,i didn't know

830
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,490
you'd be coming for christmas.

831
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:16,650
Ah,no worries,eric. Please,call me bart.

832
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,210
But some gifts are for keeps.

833
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,150
For you. Thank you.

834
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,260
Eric,serena,

835
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,920
I just want you to know

836
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:29,710
That i have deep
feelings for your mother.

837
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,220
Mom,your phone.

838
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,037
Oh. Uh,lily,you're not gonna

839
00:40:34,038 --> 00:40:35,930
want to interrupt this moment.

840
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,750
Other presents come
when you least expect em.

841
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,080
* the world grows older *

842
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,490
Hey,lil. You know everything's
closed on christmas?

843
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,260
Diners that claim
to be open 24/7-

844
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,100
It's false advertising.

845
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,660
* all that i want *

846
00:40:58,810 --> 00:40:59,870
And everyone knows

847
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:03,560
The biggest present
comes in the smallest box.

848
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,300
So,uh,alison's leaving.

849
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:08,520
She's spending time
alone with the kids.

850
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,310
And i seem to have walked
all the way from brooklyn

851
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:13,160
To your doorstep

852
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,250
Without a jacket, in the snow.

853
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,550
So what the hell?

854
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,020
I miss you...

855
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,690
And i have been
missing you for a while.

856
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,360
* all that i want *

857
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,440
Lily...

858
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:38,550
Would you do me the
honor of being my wife?

859
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,930
(Eleanor,roman,dorota) fromage! Cheese!

860
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,320
Ah,perfect.

861
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,720
Then there are those boxes

862
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,570
You wish you had never opened...

863
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,280
(Eleanor) oh,i
like the pa-

864
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,600
Don't worry, b. Who would i tell?

865
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,930
Have a holly jolly christmas. (Beep)

866
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,560
