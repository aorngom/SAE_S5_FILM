(Gossip girl) gossip girl
here--Your one and only source

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,110
Into the scandalous lives  of manhattan's
elite. I've decided to take over bass industries.

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:12,010
There is one stipulation-- That should
you in any way act inappropriately,

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,550
The board has the option to
replace you with your lel guardian,

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,130
Which--Wouldn't
you know it? Is me.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,020
I had enough trouble with the
idea of mom and rufus dating,

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,000
But now i share a
sibling with my boyfriend?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,030
Maybe we weren't meant to be a family.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,830
Serena,dean berube.

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,170
I'd like to issue a press release that
you came up to visit our glorious campus.

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,870
Princeton is a trade
school. There is only yale.

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,060
He said that yale could really
use a girl like blair waldorf.

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,250
(Laughs) oh,b.,i'm so happy for you.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,860
And who am i?

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,330
That's a secret  i'll never tell.

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:47,950
You know you love me.

17
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,180
X.O.X.O.,gossip girl.

00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,580
True love and betrayal,
revenge and more revenge,

20
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,930
A heroine  with an
impossible goal--

21
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,860
If only mozart had lived
on the upper east side.

22
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,280
(Harold) blair bear,you'll be late!

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
But you can keep  your
magic flute,amadeus.

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,430
All this queen wants is
a golden ticket to yale.

25
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,960
You look like a firing squad.

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,480
More like a welcoming
committee. It's the big day.

27
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,720
It's all the color of yale. You see?

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,880
That's just what i need to perk
me up. I couldn't sleep a wink.

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,840
We know. We heard you
watching "gilmore girls"

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,640
All night,again. (Chuckles)

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,880
Oh. I am so a better fit
for yale than that rory.

32
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,790
Dorota.

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,700
Don't be sad. I'm not going
anywhere for six months.

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,530
That wasn't dorota,dear.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,380
That was handsome dan.

36
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,310
Look at him. Yeah,he's
a gift from all of us.

37
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,850
He's the yale
mascot,bulldog--

38
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,660
Just like you after today.

39
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,680
I don't know about the name,though.

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,420
We should just call him "handsome."

41
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,960
(Baby voice) you're adorable.
Yes,just don't look behind sofa.

42
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,170
No,you're a shoo-In,darling. (Laughs)

43
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,400
Mademoiselle.  Merci.

44
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,560
A shoo-In.

45
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:09,630
The personal letter that i wrote to
dean berube should simply cinch it.

46
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,560
We will celebrate your acceptance tonight at
the opera with champagne at all intermissions.

47
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,410
We will be so drunk. By the time
someone dies,we'll just laugh.

48
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,830
Is chuck joining us?

49
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,970
You know how he loves a good
tragedy. Yes. Where is mr. Chuck?

50
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,820
I wouldn't know,and i don't care.

51
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,000
He's as dead to me as his
father is to him. More bluerries.

52
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,090
Whew! Yale day.

53
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,760
Good morning. Mm.

54
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,550
I thought we could walk to
school together for support.

55
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,680
I keep telling myself that
everything happens for a reason.

56
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,470
You know,i'll--I'll end
up in the right place,

57
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,070
But what if i don't get in?

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,000
Pfft. Forget you. What
if i do and blair doesn't?

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,730
Fire and--And brimstone
and a lot of bitchy asides,

60
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,070
Death by dorota. Thanks. You
don't have to worry either.

61
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,740
Blair's a lock. The dean
told her as much,right?

62
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,490
Yeah. Yeah,yale is good.

63
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,380
We're good.

64
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,490
Everything will be fine.

65
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,010
You're referring to the
recent not fun event,

66
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,050
Uh,also known as the
"you two share a brother,

67
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,920
Oh,wait. No,you don't" roller coaster.

68
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,210
(Chuckles) not to be
outdone by the tilt-A-Whirl

69
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,480
Called "discovering
this fact has only served

70
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,850
To bringing rufus and
lily closer than ever."

71
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,580
(Chuckles) look,getting into
yale will change our lives.

72
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,060
It'll give us a chance
to reinvent ourselves.

73
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,930
Yeah. Yeah,and in the meantime,

74
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,450
At least our pents are
keeping it on the down low.

75
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,070
Yeah. Rufus,stop it.

76
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,150
Oh,hello.

77
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,270
I was planning on sneaking
out before anyone got up,

78
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,990
But lily and i got to bed so late. Oh,you
don't--You-- That's--Just stop there.

79
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,750
Right.

80
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,680
Well,now that this is
all out in the open,

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,960
Maybe we can stop sneaking around.

82
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,810
I mean,we've had the awkward
run-In,and it isn't so bad.

83
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,580
I don't know why we thought
this would be so weird.

84
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,100
Let's leave now. Nice try,mom.

85
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,650
Ah,seriously good effort.

86
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,320
So i was
thinking,tonight--

87
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,480
More than four hours of sleep?

88
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,130
That,and there is a
charity gala at the opera.

89
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,670
A full 12 hours then.
Oh,everyone will be there.

90
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,810
It's the--It's the
event of the season,

91
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,300
And i'm really feeling ready
to get back to the world.

92
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,940
Aren't you worried about people
seeing us together so soon?

93
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,310
The kids know. Why shouldn't the world?

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,600
And,uh,we might as well make
our society debut in style.

95
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,280
I was just trying to get out of
the opera part. I'm not a fan.

96
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,860
Well,you can become one tonight.

97
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,200
I would say,"get a room,"
but yours is right above mine.

98
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,590
Please try to remember that.

99
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,370
(Whispers) oh,my god.

100
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,040
No,i told you,under
18,and i want verification.

101
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,780
I don't care where you
have to import them from.

102
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,570
I want them young and unstable.
(Mouth full) you can cancel that order.

103
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,600
I already ate.

104
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,910
I'll get right back to you.

105
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,110
Your bush league
attempts to take me down--

106
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,770
They're getting boring.
Although,i must admit,

107
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,100
Having the freshman class of brearley hold
their annual sleepover in my hotel room--

108
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,170
That was a nictouch. By
the way,don't be alarmed,

109
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,810
But,uh,our stock might
take a little dip today.

110
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,540
I'm still adjusting to a learning curve.
No,what you're doing is trying too hard.

111
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,040
You're obviously not
cut out for the job,

112
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,560
Which is why bart never
let you out of the outback.

113
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,050
You should be more careful.

114
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,680
Or what? It's my company
now,kid. You saw to that.

115
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,600
Will the,uh,board and i be
seeing you at the opera tonight?

116
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,660
Even though you're no longer in charge,

117
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,520
You are still the public
face of the company.

118
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,050
I think it's important you display it,

119
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,920
Show there's no hard feelings.

120
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,550
Oh,wait. You're already doing
that for me,aren't you? No matter.

121
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,050
We probably won't be seeing
much of each other anyway.

122
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,320
I'll be in your father's seats,

123
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,130
And you'll be,well,somewhere else.

124
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,930
There's a new ki that "kid" is
my shakespeare teacher,miss carr.

125
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,800
That-That's miss carr? Does she
have benjamin button syndrome?

126
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,290
(Chuckles) here. Let us help you.

127
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,840
It's all right. Oh,thank you,serena. It's
like holding a door never occurred to anybody.

128
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,600
No,not on the upper east
side. These kids have probably

129
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,060
Never touched a door in their life. They
just magically open for them,don't they?

130
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,760
Oh,uh,this is my
boyfriend,dan humphrey. Hi.

131
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,540
Dan,this is miss ca. She's my favorite new
teacher. Well,i've heard a lot about you,

132
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,130
Although i-I wasn't expecting
you to look so... out of place?

133
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,300
No,i was gonna say "young." You could pass
for a student. Well,i was,until recently.

134
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,010
I've been doing teach for america
the past two years in alabama.

135
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,130
This is my first salaried job.

136
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,550
I've never even been to new york before.

137
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,710
It's a lot different than des moines.
My family is in the hotel business,

138
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,670
And the palace lobby is a wonderful
place to get away from the noise.

139
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,800
Yeah,and,you know,if
you're ever in brooklyn,

140
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,070
Uh,my dad has a gallery. There's a pretty cool cafe.
Brooklyn--That's,uh,the place across the bridge,right?

141
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:07,260
Ha ha. Yeah. You'll fit in just fine
here. Oh,hey,don't let the city get to you.

142
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,880
See you third period. Mm-Hmm.

143
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,130
Nice meeting you,daniel.
Nice meeting you,miss carr.

144
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,300
So good luck today.

145
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,500
You,too. May the best get in.

146
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,060
Refresh. Refresh. Refresh.

147
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,390
That's not my eli account. No,it's
mine. I applied to yale,too,remember?

148
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,460
Yes,but your application was merely a
formality to appease your overbearing parents.

149
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,140
You know very well there's no way
yale is going to accept someone

150
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,520
Who got a 2360 on her s.A.T.S,

151
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,410
So give up and go for
the gold,my gold. Refresh.

152
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,340
Hey,are you going to
the opera thing tonight?

153
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,330
Um,yeah. Serena's taking me.

154
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,850
Yeah? I might go,too.

155
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,290
You know,for a while,i couldn't
take vanessa anywhere really nice,

156
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,740
'Cause of the whole no money thing,

157
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,920
But i saw a dvd of the
"ring" cycle at her house,

158
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,680
And i figured she might like
some champagne in my family's box.

159
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,620
Yeah,that's good. That's good.
Don't tell her you saw that dvd,

160
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,450
Though,'cause i-I pointed it out once,

161
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,320
And she made me watch the whole
thing with no subtitles. Wow.

162
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,530
If you've ever seen
"a clockwork orange,"

163
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,910
You know how that ended up.
Wait. What's "a clockwork orange"?

164
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,930
Charles,i didn't
expect to see you today.

165
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,690
Or ever,if i had it my way.

166
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,300
Yes,well,i missed you,too.

167
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,250
I'm trying to do something.

168
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,230
I really wanted to do it on my own,

169
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,780
But that's not working.

170
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,840
I'm thinking you're the only
person left who can help.

171
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,380
What do you say?

172
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,270
What are you guys doing? Shh.
Don't talk to them. They're working.

173
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,320
Refresh.

174
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,020
My... god.

175
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,640
What? What is it?

176
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,420
I'm sorry. I...

177
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,630
i simply can't read it.

178
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,090
The font's too small. I have
to check it on a real computer.

179
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,960
It says "wait-Listed" in bold.

180
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,800
I got in. I did it.
I got in. Oh,my gosh!

181
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,950
I can't believe it. Oh,did you?

182
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,120
No. No,no. Um,i'm
wait-Listed,just like blair.

183
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,250
Well,don't worry. You'll get in.

184
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,020
We'll be together next fall.
Even if you have to wait

185
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,990
Another couple of months
to find out for sure,

186
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,450
It's all good,or it will be.

187
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,820
Yeah,i know it will.

188
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,910
(Blair) i need to see the headmistress.

189
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,580
Right now!

190
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,340
They say that it's not over  till the fat lady sings.

191
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,410
But who's that i hear
tuning up in the wings?

192
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,180
Sorry,b.  I think it's curtains.

193
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,010
??

194
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,730
??

195
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,130
??

196
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,370
??

197
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,760
??

198
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,930
?

199
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,770
??

200
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,640
??

201
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,090
You're living alone. Why
don't you move back in here?

202
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,080
It'll make it a lot easier to work together.
I'm not interested in a family reunion

203
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,780
Nor in assuaging your guilt
over my father's death.

204
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,290
Do you believe in my cause or not?

205
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,410
I do,

206
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,020
But your shenanigans--
Planting coke in his gym bag,

207
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,440
Ambushing him with a
transsexual hooker...

208
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,200
Two. They owed me a favor.

209
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,530
Will only cast a negative light
on you in the board's eyes.

210
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,130
I don't care about the board anymore.

211
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,650
You should. You need them.

212
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,610
So let me help you by
handling this like a grownup.

213
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,240
My 20% stake in bass industries
must count for something,

214
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,370
And when i'm done,

215
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,090
Perhaps you'll reconsider
your living situation.

216
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,430
Don't hold your breath.

217
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,110
Meet me here at 2:00?

218
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,480
How did this happen?

219
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,760
Dean berube said i was a perfect fit.

220
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,350
His exact words were,

221
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,820
"Yale could use a girl
like blair waldorf."

222
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,000
Well,apparently,they
found one somewhere else.

223
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,530
Calm yourself.

224
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,200
When i spoke to dean
berube this morning,

225
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,620
He assured me that if the student
they've accepted turns them down,

226
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,400
You are next in line.

227
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,630
Dan humphrey?

228
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,430
He's like a cafeteria
lady who won the lottery.

229
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,610
You couldn't pry that acceptance
from his hands with the jaws of life.

230
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,920
I wasn't speaking about mr. Humphrey.

231
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,230
Someone from constance got in?

232
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,510
Blair,in our school's
history,most wait-Listed students

233
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,230
Ultimately get into the
college of their choice.

234
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,510
Your transcript is a
series of unblemished a's.

235
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,970
All you have to do is keep up
your g.P.A.,and you'll get in.

236
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,600
I know that patience and trust
aren't necessarily your strong suits,

237
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,640
But you'll just have to
rise to the occasion,hmm?

238
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,480
Thank you. I'm sure i can do that.

239
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,750
Just tell me who got in.

240
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,960
You got in? Congratulations.

241
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,610
Oh,shh. Don't say it too loud.
I haven't told anyone yet,

242
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,810
Not even dan,especially not blair.

243
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,850
Well,why not? Oh,i-I couldn't.

244
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,680
She was wait-Listed. It
would have been a disaster.

245
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,420
A word of
unsolicited advice--

246
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,040
It sounds like you're
worrying about other people

247
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,370
When this is a decision about you.

248
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,510
Do you want yale?

249
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,820
Do you know you're the first
person that's ever asked me that?

250
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,140
The truth is,i
don't--I don't know.

251
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,920
The wholreason i went there in the
first place was because of blair,

252
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,280
And then i applied because of dan.

253
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:11,150
Honestly,i think yale might be
accepting me for the wrong reasons.

254
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,360
I would never advise anyone to
turn down a great opportunity,

255
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,390
But going to the right school for
you is the most important thing.

256
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,470
Serena,did you hear someone
from constance got in?

257
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,010
I bet it's that little nelly.

258
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,500
When i find her,she's
not gonna know--Hello.

259
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,510
Blair,i missed you first period.

260
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,150
I had a meeting.

261
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,290
You also missed getting this back.

262
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,420
I'll talk to you later,serena.Bye.

263
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,640
Well,if you're on a witch hunt,

264
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,100
That means you can't be too upset,right?

265
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,320
Witch hunts are my valium,serena.

266
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,300
I'm just trying to stay calm.

267
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,450
What about you?

268
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,070
I have to say,i'm totally
surprised yale passed up

269
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,090
The p.R. Of accepting "it"
girl serena van der woodsen.

270
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,900
They have more class than i thought.

271
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,280
Well,like you pointed
out,they didn't want me for me.

272
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,760
Dan must be pissed.

273
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,690
His hope of arriving on campus
with cachet has been shot to hell.

274
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,920
Now he'll just be lumped in with the
rest of the financial aid-Iots and poets.

275
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,420
Oh,my god.

276
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,860
What?

277
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,010
I have to go.

278
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,110
Hello? (Woman) miss van der woodsen,

279
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,170
This is shirley from
dean berube's office.

280
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,720
The dean would love to
issue a press release

281
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,480
That you'll be joining yale's
freshman class in the fall,

282
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,800
Assuming you're accepting.

283
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,750
Would you mind? Miss van der woodsen?

284
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,580
Um,i-I-I'm gonna have to call
you back. (Snaps phone shut)

285
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,620
Charles has left us no choice.

286
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,650
We wish you had been left
in charge of the company,

287
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,210
Of course,but that's
not how it laid out.

288
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,710
Well,surely there must be
something. Jack is charles' guardian,

289
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,070
And the contract clearly states
that his guardian has control.

290
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,650
Short of being able to prove
he's completely negligent,

291
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,930
All we can do is our best
to temper his actions.

292
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,750
Minority shareholders' meeting.

293
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,570
We were just finishing up.

294
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,610
See you soon,i hope,lilian?

295
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,270
Yes,peter,i'd like that.

296
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,220
Had i known my own personal
mata hari was going to be here,

297
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,300
I would have come sooner. Yes,well,i
was just being brought up to date

298
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,990
On your progress or lack thereof.
I'll right myself eventually.

299
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,640
I just have to get my
legs under me. (Sniffles)

300
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,730
Maybe the two of us could
come together in some way,

301
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,350
Help me find my strength...
or use it all up.

302
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,850
What's that for? Your nose.

303
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,050
You don't seem so worried about the same
morality clause that cost charles this company.

304
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,410
They won't touch me.

305
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,970
Although i may not be
doing a bang-Up job yet,

306
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,280
It beats having a won of
your reputation at the helm.

307
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,310
This is a "b."

308
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,630
Yes,it is.

309
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,130
You're new here,so you
don't know how it works.

310
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,040
I have a feeling you're about to explain.
Second semester seniors get a free pass,

311
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,900
Like pregnant ladies or
14-Year-Old chinese gymnasts.

312
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,690
Constance wants their students
to get into the best colleges.

313
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,990
That's why this free pass exists.

314
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,470
The headmistress-- If she
knew about this grade--

315
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,810
She'd rap you on the wrist.

316
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,230
Maybe in time,i'll get in trouble

317
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,190
For not inflating grades like
everyone else,miss waldorf,

318
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,670
But until then,i'll
give them based on merit.

319
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,920
I need to keep my g.P.A.
Perfect to get into yale.

320
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,680
You should have thought of that before.

321
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,690
What's wrong? I think i
might have just lost yale.

322
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,020
What am i gonna do?

323
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,410
I didn't apply anywhere else.

324
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,770
Just hold on a second.

325
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,730
There's a phone call i have to return.

326
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,910
??

327
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,830
??

328
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,830
??

329
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,200
??

330
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,270
???

331
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,410
??

332
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,940
??

333
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:29,020
??

334
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,390
Look,i understand why you're
trying to do these things,

335
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,540
But we have got to do
something that is not illegal.

336
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,390
I've put calls in to jack's
business associates in australia.

337
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,460
He's not the most upstanding citizen.

338
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,280
I'm sure we will find something.

339
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,480
You know,i,um,i thought i lost
you the day of the funeral,

340
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,430
And,um,i'm sorry

341
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,080
That jack's the one to
bring us back together,

342
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,710
But i'm glad that we're doing this.

343
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,490
If your people don't
come up with anything,

344
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,740
Maybe we could try number 26.

345
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,630
"Crash jack in plane."

346
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,140
The bass jet is kind
of expensive,charles.

347
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,310
There's insurance. (Cell phone rings)

348
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:10,900
Hello?

349
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,710
Yes. Yeah,that would be fine.

350
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,230
I can't really talk right now.

351
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,020
Yes,the,uh,the opera
has an early curtain.

352
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,110
Rufus,stop it.

353
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,430
Okay,okay. I'll see you then.

354
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,680
Bye.

355
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,860
I can't believe you.
You're actually going

356
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,150
To take your half-Price
hustler out on the town tonight.

357
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,300
I thought we were putting
this behind us,charles.

358
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,460
I'm here to help you.

359
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,800
And what part of you dating someone else

360
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,270
A month after my father's
death is helping me?

361
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,510
You say you want to be
family,but if you really meant it,

362
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,460
You wouldn't parade
your mistress in public.

363
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,260
You'd have some tact,

364
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,610
Some respect.

365
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,010
This isn't about your father,charles.

366
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,530
I should have known from your
history i couldn't count on you.

367
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,750
You think of yourself.

368
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,890
Your kids and my dead
father are proof of that.

369
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,910
Hey.

370
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,080
Hey,i was thinking maybe we
could go to yale this weekend,

371
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,480
Get some hope into you.
(Whispers) she's going down.

372
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,350
(Blair) yes,she's gonna go.

373
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,360
Would you excuse me for a
second? (Scoffs) not really.

374
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,900
I know that look. You're up to no
good. (Scoffs) good is subjective,

375
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,550
And if you don't believe me,you can look it up. You
want to get rachel back for the grade she gave you.

376
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,990
A new teacher's like a child.
It has to be taught. And spanked.

377
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,840
And i can't risk not getting into yale,

378
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,150
So it's open season on miss iowa.

379
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,420
(Blair) time to shuck the corn.

380
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,090
I wasn't supposed to say anything,but
you--You are going to yale.

381
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,090
You got in,an early admission. What?

382
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,610
How do you know that?

383
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,980
Because i declined my
acceptance. You're next in line.

384
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,400
They're gonna call you in a couple
hours. Whoa. You--You got in?

385
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,020
You're the constance student?

386
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,070
Cancel the nelly yuki project now!

387
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,340
S.,why would you turn down yale?

388
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,510
And don't say for me,because
even i wouldn't believe you.

389
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,950
Yeah,why--Why
would you do that?

390
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,010
I'm--I'm sorry. I-I
wanted to tell you.

391
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,400
You don't want to go?

392
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,470
No. No,i don't.

393
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,410
No,please. I'll--I'll
see you later.

394
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,130
So--So you're not gonna
go after rachel now,right?

395
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,400
What would be the point?

396
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,850
Okay,okay. Hey,so the reason i
asked you to come down is because--

397
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,400
No,wait,wait,wait. Me first.

398
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,370
Okay. Okay,ever since
you got your money back,

399
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,230
You've been taking me to do
all these archibald-Y things,

400
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,480
Which i love. I just can't keep up.

401
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,960
So i decided to do something for us.

402
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,010
We're going to the opera tonight.

403
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,560
Wow. That is fantastic.

404
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,410
They're nosebleed seats,but
at least they're something,

405
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,800
And i got them. So what did
you bring me up here for anyway?

406
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,170
Well,there's no reason.
I just wanted to see you.

407
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,960
And then the--The
queen of the night

408
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,810
Sings this kick-Ass aria,

409
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,200
"Der holle rache kocht
in meinem herzen,"

410
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,020
"The vengeance of hell
boils in my heart."

411
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,610
Lovely. It is.

412
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,290
It reaches a high "f"--That--
That never happens in operas.

413
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,050
You know,that's a good fact.

414
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,990
You should talk about
it at intermission.

415
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,000
You're gonna love "the magic flute."
It's,uh,well,it's... it's okay. You can say it.

416
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,450
Opera for amateurs.

417
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,250
(Chuckles) if anybody asks you
what you thought,just tell 'em,

418
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,400
"Ist war wunderschien.  Danke. Und sie?"

419
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,540
That's what klaus always used to say.

420
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,900
Well,that and--And
"geh zum teufel,"

421
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,450
But,um,whatever you do,don't--Don't
say that. Okay,this is ridiculous.

422
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,300
Dad,lily loves you 'cause you're not that
guy. Eh. This feels a little different.

423
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,640
Only 'cause you're letting it. No,he's
right. In our world,people say one thing,

424
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,000
But they expect something
else. If you can hd your own,

425
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,880
It'll go a long way with
my mom and her friends.

426
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,490
Everyone can geh zum teufel.
I just want to do right by her.

427
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,820
Let's talk "singspiel,"
shall we? "Singspiel."

428
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,210
The devil would say,

429
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,670
"You're already in
yale. You ha security.

430
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,760
Now more than ever,you
can do what you want."

431
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,150
And an angel would say,

432
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,000
"All the more reasonnotto.
Youhavewhat you want."

433
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,020
You don't have a perfect transcript.

434
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,410
But you don't need one. You're in.

435
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,870
Ugh! I hate having to play the angel.

436
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,080
I know. The devil is so much better.

437
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,080
So,b.,who won?

438
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,460
Gimme.

439
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,650
Hello. Miss carr? It's blair waldorf.

440
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,830
How did you get my number? I wanted
to apologize for my behavior earlier.

441
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,710
I was hoping you'd afford me the chance
to move past it. I'd like that,too,

442
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,470
But couldn't this have waited
till we saw each other again?

443
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,090
That's precisely why i'm calling.

444
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,610
Did you know the school
has a block of tickets

445
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,410
To the opera tonight? To the
opera? No,i didn't know that.

446
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,380
Oh,yes. It's a gala event,and my famil

447
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,430
Who's heard all about you,asked
if you could come to dinner

448
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,970
And then join us in our
grand tier seats afterwards.

449
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,760
I don't think that's such a
good idea in light of today

450
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,850
Or at all. Nonsense.
We have an extra ticket.

451
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,620
You're not gonna let
our little disagreement

452
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,360
Stand in the way of the opera?

453
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,030
I-I have always wanted to go.

454
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,150
Do you have a pen handy?

455
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,120
Yeah.

456
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,750
Spotted--B.
Hot for teacher.

457
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,680
Too bad miss carr

458
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,720
Doesn't remember  the
devil is in the details.

459
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,760
What do you say the
boathouse in central park?

460
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,150
We meet at 6:30 and walk
over for curtain at 8:00.

461
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,540
Thank you. Sounds wonderful.

462
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,060
Yes. Yes,it does.

463
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,050
That sounds great. I can't wait.

464
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,980
Box two. Uh,row two. Two for you.

465
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,550
Thanks.

466
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,900
You know what? Uh,if you'll excuse me?

467
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,060
(Speaks indistinctly) uh,no,thank you.

468
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,460
Uh... am i glad to see you.

469
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,490
Serena and i had to meet up with
our parents before we got here,

470
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,230
And it went from "family
ties" to faulkner...

471
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,550
Ooh. In one cocktail flat.

472
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,820
Uh,hey,you excited about your box?

473
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,870
My what? Oh,hey,we're on the
third tier,actually. Yeah.

474
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,910
It's,um,a better view and straight on.

475
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,910
Oh. Oh,yeah. Well,third tier's awesome.

476
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,680
Yep.

477
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,450
What's going on here?
Nothing. Nothing's going on.

478
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:32,260
Okay,so there might be some
other seats \available to us.

479
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,810
Lily. Didn't know you'd be here.

480
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,070
O's your lky escort this evening?

481
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,240
Someone you picked up at the funeral?

482
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,940
Mm,this is rufus
humphrey,the man i'm seeing.

483
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,550
Mm. You remember pauletta cho?

484
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,280
She's head of publicity for
my company.  Our company.

485
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,450
Yes,hi. It's nice to see you,pauletta.

486
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,890
But your choice of
companion? Not so nice.

487
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,480
I'm here to keep an eye on
him more than anything else.

488
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,710
Hope you both enjoy the show.

489
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,000
And if not,you can ponder why

490
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,250
You thought coming here
together was a good idea.

491
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,240
Enjoy "tristan und isolde."

492
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,600
Okay.

493
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,110
This isn't "e magic flute"? Oh,no.

494
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,350
That opera ended weeks
ago,and it's mainly for kids.

495
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,470
Ah,kids. You gotta love
'em. (Sighs deeply) yeah.

496
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,660
They do such great things,like
misread the opera calendar.

497
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,470
Bruce,hello.

498
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,760
Hey,my condolences about bart.
I-I haven't wanted to call.

499
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,500
I-I didn't want to be a bother
in your--Your time of grief.

500
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,140
Uh,well,now that you're here,what
do you want me to do about those,

501
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,120
Uh,documen i'd been working on?

502
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,250
Um... could you wait
here for just a moment?

503
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,140
What's going on? I just
need to talk to charles.

504
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,350
Um,you two can just talk
about opera while i'm gone.

505
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,890
The answer is so simple. How
could i have forgotten it?

506
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,730
Any chance you could try and forget me?

507
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,450
Just meet me back here in 15 minutes.

508
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,840
And if you don't like what i suggest,

509
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,480
I won't bother you
again. You have my word.

510
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,980
You don't have any binoculars,do you?

511
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,320
(Whispers) oh,or how about
those cool little spy glasses?

512
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,490
Or a telescope.

513
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,580
All right,i get it. You
want to go to the stupid box.

514
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,880
Not if you don't want to.

515
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,150
Once the show starts,i'm sure
it'll be great from up here. Yeah.

516
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,920
Candy,dear?

517
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,250
You know,it's not that you don't
want to go to the same college as me.

518
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,960
It's not? No. A lot of couples
go to different schools.

519
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,110
But,you know,for months,

520
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,750
You acted like going to yale
together was what you wanted.

521
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,570
Well,i didn't figure it out until today.

522
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,960
And brown is just a
better fit for me,dan.

523
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,390
Well,and what about us?
I mean,do we still "fit"?

524
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,290
Well,it's--It's not like we
have to decide anything now.

525
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,470
We can just-- What? We can
go on having you make choices

526
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,060
That affect both of our lives
without you talking to me?

527
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,280
Look,i'm sorry. (Sighs
deeply) i'm sorry.

528
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,130
I was just-- I was
so happy about yale.

529
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,730
If we went together,you know,

530
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,960
We'd get four years away
from--From everything and from...

531
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,430
everyone.

532
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,330
But   are gonna follow us
to college,wherever we go.

533
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,820
And what if our parents stay together?

534
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,590
What happens then? More
uncomfortable dinners?

535
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,550
Adjoining rooms on family vacations?

536
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,030
Pretending not to hear what we hear
in the middle of the night? (Chuckles)

537
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,450
I mean,who knows how long
that's gonna last for?

538
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,850
Well,you know,i think we'll just
have to compartmentalize everything.

539
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,820
The--The two of them
will be its own thing

540
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,930
That we'll put in a box and
just keep away somewhere.

541
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:32,680
Things don't just go in
boxes. They go all together.

542
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,590
No,they don't.

543
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,870
No,they--They go in boxes
with really tight lids

544
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:42,180
That you bury deep in holes
at the bottom of the ocean.

545
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,540
Okay. (Laughs)

546
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,730
Providence is just a
train ride from new haven.

547
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,440
I think we're just gonna have to try and
push through the next couple of months.

548
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,410
Yes.

549
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,550
And knowing them,it--It
won't last,right?

550
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,140
I mean,it can't.

551
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,250
It could never.

552
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,240
I,uh,studied the wrong opera.

553
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,080
I wanted to impress
you and your friends,

554
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,440
And prove that i could exist
in both your world and mine.

555
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,450
Oh,rufus. I don't care
what anyone thinks.

556
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,740
You exist in our world,and it's
the only world that matters.

557
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,910
Thanks for trying.

558
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,530
Oh. Oh,god. Where are
the boxes with the lids?

559
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,570
Why don't you guys
head,um,up to our seats?

560
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,220
I have to handle first.

561
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,520
Okay. Yeah.

562
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,680
(Dan) right behind you.

563
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,420
Here we go.

564
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,600
And,uh...

565
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,870
(cell phone rings)
darling,turn off your phone.

566
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,130
Remember the kevi

567
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,820
Hello,headmistress queller.

568
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,320
(Queller) blair,i'm sorry
to call you after hours,

569
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,270
But ms. Carr told me how upset
you were about your grade.

570
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,800
She did? I confirmed with her

571
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,530
That so long as the rest of your grades

572
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,800
Were up to your usual high standard,

573
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,930
That you would still end
the course with an "a."

574
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,830
It was sweet of ms.
Carr to be so concerned.

575
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,890
She's a good asset to the school.

576
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,200
I think she cares about her students.

577
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,390
She cares about their futures.
Have a good weekend. Thank you.

578
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,050
I'm sorry,but i have to go.

579
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,280
The opera's about to begin.

580
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,150
It can wait. I have to fix something.

581
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,070
Who's this? Bruce caplan. I'm
your father's family lawyer.

582
00:31:59,070 --> 00:31:59,660
Before he died,

583
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,110
Your dad was going to
legally adopt serena and eric.

584
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,990
And i was going to legally adopt you.

585
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,910
We were serious about
becoming a real family,

586
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,550
And we'd had the papers drawn,and
your father had signed them.

587
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,650
I just didn't get to it in time.

588
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,500
Your stepmother asked me to have
these faxed over to the box office.

589
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,090
So if you adopt me...
then i'm your guardian.

590
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,800
Give me a pen.

591
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,330
Just to be clear,this doesn't
make us family,just even.

592
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,080
What do you think you're doing?

593
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,300
You can't sign anything
without my consent.

594
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,720
Not anymore.

595
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,360
I'm sending you back where you belong.

596
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,960
You just lost the company.

597
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,640
Sticks and stones  may break bones,

598
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,810
But a poison pen  is the best revenge.

599
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,080
Now if you'll excuse me,i'm going home.

600
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,660
I was on my way to find you and
apologize. "On your way" an hour later?

601
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,280
I feel terrible. I do.

602
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,110
And...

603
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,510
as much as i wish i
wasn't,i'm still learning.

604
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,770
It's like you not inflating your grades.

605
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:47,070
I can't not act out against people.

606
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,660
But i'm trying.

607
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,790
So... (sighs) please forgive me.

608
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,950
I accept your apology.

609
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,700
Come. Let's see if we can
find you another ticket.

610
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,650
I'm actually quite tired.

611
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,390
I'll just see you monday?

612
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,190
Yes,of course.

613
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,110
Thank you again.

614
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,080
Headmistress? (Queller) rachel?

615
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,050
I'm sorry to bother you.

616
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,380
I just need to talk
to you about something.

617
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,020
I hate losing.

618
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,180
You didn't lose. Mm-Hmm.

619
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,680
You just admitted defeat.

620
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:46,030
You know what's great about a box? Hmm?

621
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,860
(Whispers) when the opera gets boring...

622
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,730
* i don't care what
you did so long ago *

623
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,940
* it don't move... *

624
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,130
What do you think you're
doing? (Locks door)

625
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,820
I should ask you the same thing.

626
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:15,160
It's what bart wanted. I'm sorry.

627
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,290
So you say. I'm not so sure.

628
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,590
I'm not scared of
you,jack. You should be.

629
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,100
You're high and you're
not thinking clearly.

630
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,300
You need to think about the
repercussions of what you're doing.

631
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,120
I don't think i do.

632
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:36,920
I just had a full conversation with
this opera-Goer about "the magic flute."

633
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,460
And he pretended like that was
exactly what he just watched.

634
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,370
I'm beginning to get
these society people.

635
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,760
It's all a big game of pretending like
you know what you're talking about. Mm.

636
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,730
Where's lily? I don't know. I
haven't seen her all intermission.

637
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,750
Keep an eye out for her,huh? All right.

638
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,470
Chuck.

639
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,100
As much as i hate to ask you
anything,have you seen lily?

640
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,450
My dad's looking for her.

641
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,620
She said she was going
to the powder room.

642
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,400
But that was a while ago.

643
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,140
What's going on here?

644
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,510
What are you doing?

645
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,040
Why is this door locked?

646
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,300
* you only look at what
you see in the mirror *

647
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:29,000
* you never look at what
you see around here *

648
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,020
You think you can squeeze
me out,take away my power?!

649
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,980
I worked for this! I earned it!

650
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,950
* you only look... *

651
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,690
Jack,it's over.

652
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,770
Stop it! You can't do this! Get off me!

653
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,980
I can't? Who in this town
wouldn't believe that the whore

654
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,820
Didn't ask for it?! Stop! Please!

655
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,650
Hey! Get off her!

656
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,230
(Pts) you stup kid.

657
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,730
* suicide *

658
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,450
Oh,rufus! Oh,my god. Lily!

659
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,700
Come on.

660
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,330
Get off of me!

661
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,300
Oh,my god. Thank you.

662
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,390
??

663
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,960
I heard from the board that jack
is on his way back to sydney.

664
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,670
You didn't press charges.

665
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,840
No,i just wanted him gone.

666
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,300
But now i'm the,uh,interim
head of bass industries,

667
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,850
Believe it or not. Is that
why you called me here?

668
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,230
What you did for me
last night-- Lily...

669
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,410
It's okay. You don't
have to feel the same way.

670
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,470
But i do have faith
that when you're ready,

671
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:26,790
You will do wonders
with bass industries.

672
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,410
What are you talking about?

673
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,260
On your 18th birthday,i
want you to have everything.

674
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,370
I don't want this job
or the corporate jet

675
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:37,150
Or anything related to this business.

676
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,050
Just you,

677
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,860
As a part of my family.

678
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,540
Look...

679
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,910
i know what happened to
my father was an accident.

680
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,750
It was a terrible accident.

681
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,520
And,um...

682
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,670
if the offer still stands...

683
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,190
i'd like to move back in.

684
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,670
I would love that.

685
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,290
The thing about new beginnings

686
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,150
Is that they require
something else to end.

687
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,700
Hey! I'm just on my way out.

688
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,310
Miss blair,we must go or
we be late. (Mouths words)

689
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,780
The headmistress asked if i
could come meet her at school.

690
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,470
I figured she wants to have tea like
we did when i first applied to yale.

691
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:33,290
What are you doing? I'm just
reading the brown catalogue.

692
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,830
Oh,and i ordered a
home dreadlocking kit.

693
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,260
Wanna meet up later?

694
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,030
Definitely. Maybe we can get
a jump start on your veganism.

695
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,520
Have some celebratory
seitan at angelica kitchen?

696
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,170
Mm,i can't think of anything better...

697
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,480
Or grosser. (Laughs)

698
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,640
I'll call you after.

699
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,670
Okay.

700
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,940
Some endings take a long
time  to reveal themselves.

701
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,480
But when they do,they're
almost too easy to ignore.

702
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,760
Hey,ms. Carr. What are you doing here?

703
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,320
Rachel.

704
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,510
And i'm taking your advice to
come out to brooklyn sometime.

705
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,110
Can i--Can i get you anything?
I make a mean cappuccino.

706
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,920
Well,all i have to do is press "start," but
i like to pretend. That sounds great. Yeah.

707
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,050
Here,sit.

708
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,080
Some beginnings  start so quietly,

709
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,110
You don't even notice  they so
you've been on the subway now.

710
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,550
You've made it out to a borough.

711
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,370
How's the city working out for ya?
I think i'm getting the hang of it.

712
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,080
Like anything else,you just
have to make it work for you.

713
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,700
But most endings come
when you least expect them,

714
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,930
And what they portend

715
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,530
Is darker  than you've ever imagined.

716
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,760
I called you here this morning

717
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,750
Because ms. Carr told me what you did.

718
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,700
You leave me no choice
but to give you detention.

719
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,840
Yale has been notified.

720
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,920
Your acceptance has been placed on hold.

721
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,080
If you complete detention
to my satisfaction,

722
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,910
Yale will still be possible.

723
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,530
But if you do not...

724
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:17,870
(cold war kids) * lock all exit doors *

725
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,330
* "now i wanna be your dog" *

726
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,530
Put that puppy down,dorota.

727
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,870
What happened,miss blair?

728
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,630
* high tide rattling off *

729
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,850
It's what's going to happen
that you should be worried about.

730
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,470
Not all beginnings  are
cause for celebration.

731
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:36,250
A lot of bad things
begin--  Fight,flu season,

732
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,810
And the worst thing of all...

733
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,030
Uh-Oh. Is it war?

734
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,600
Yes.

735
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,630
But this one will be different.

736
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:48,720
I need to wait for my moment,and
then i'm going black ops--

737
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,800
Off the radar,no accountability.

738
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,600
This war,i'm gonna win.

739
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,410
Wanna be starting somethin'.

740
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:59,200
