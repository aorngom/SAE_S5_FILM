00:00:05,564 --> 00:00:09,409
- What's so important, Jenny?
- Holland's telling them everything...

4
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:12,403
The truth about you and Holland working
together to split up my dad and Lily.

5
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,138
We should call the police.
If we wait, he'll be gone for good.

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,428
I got to my dad before the cops did.

7
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,259
So I guess now you know
why I don't talk to you about things.

8
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:22,969
- Thanks for coming with me.
- You wanna talk about it?

9
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:26,304
I don't see what's so wrong about
wanting my life to go back to normal.

10
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,065
You need to get back to normal.

11
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:30,529
I'll be waiting
at the Empire State Building.

12
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,032
At 7:01 I'm closing
my heart to you forever.

13
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,700

Rufus,
teenage girls are a nightmare.

25
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,211
As soon as they realize that you'll
love 'em no matter what they do,

26
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:27,376
you lose all of your power.

27
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:30,005
You just have to wait
till they finish college.

28
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:32,966
Or in the case of Serena,
rebel and not go.

29
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,304
Just talk to her.
Is she in her room?

30
00:01:39,037 --> 00:01:40,804
I sent her to the loft
to stay with Dan

31
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:43,060
so I could consider
the best course of action.

32
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:45,626
Grounding her again
probably won't work.

33
00:01:46,142 --> 00:01:49,014
Short of sending her away,
I don't know anything else that will.

34
00:01:49,178 --> 00:01:50,776
I think that would be a mistake.

35
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:54,469
And I would hate to separate
her and Eric. They need each other.

36
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,084
Don't worry about me.

37
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:58,868
After what I witnessed yesterday,
you can do whatever you want with her.

38
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:00,828
She is your sister.

39
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,038
No, not by choice.
She said so herself.

40
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,212
So go ahead
and send her crazy ass away.

41
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,426
You should do it
sooner rather than later,

42
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:09,030
before she hurts anybody else.

43
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,141
Finally.

44
00:02:22,998 --> 00:02:25,269
Jenny. Hey.
You're still here.

45
00:02:26,138 --> 00:02:28,205
Thanks.
As if it wasn't humiliating enough

46
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,339
when you fell asleep
in the middle of my sentence.

47
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:31,711
Don't you mean monologue?

48
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:34,338
Seriously, though, thanks...

49
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,470
- Thanks for listening to me last night.
- Yeah, no problem.

50
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:39,623
You know I'm here for you,
whatever you need.

51
00:02:40,283 --> 00:02:40,993
But...

52
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,496
I don't want you to get
the wrong impression.

53
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:45,926
Don't worry. I get it.

54
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:48,163
You and I are friends.
You love Serena.

55
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:51,134
Although it looks like love's
a one-way street right now.

56
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,755
Did she call?

57
00:02:53,164 --> 00:02:55,031
She's mad, but she'll cool off.

58
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,009
Morning, sunshines.

59
00:02:57,582 --> 00:03:00,221
Jenny's on her way out, actually.
She just crashed the night.

60
00:03:01,204 --> 00:03:04,266
Save it. I know nothing
untoward happened.

61
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,685
That was clear by the sound
of you snoring at 2:00 A.M.

62
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:09,850
And <i>New Moon</i>
on the pay-per-view bill.

63
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:12,403
Although I was hoping
to catch you two

64
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:14,777
in the midst of something
more than a heart-to-heart.

65
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,072
I'm gonna go get dressed.

66
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,569
Be careful, Nathaniel.

67
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,248
You and Serena are on thin ice.

68
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,629
All it takes is someone to tap
their foot and that cracks.

69
00:03:29,754 --> 00:03:31,627
Oh, what do you know
about relationships?

70
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:32,890
A lot.

71
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:35,878
In fact, I'm about to save mine.
I suggest you do the same if you can.

72
00:03:38,578 --> 00:03:40,924
I'm sorry.
I cannot reach table.

73
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,682
Just this once, Dorota.

74
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,892
But if that baby does
not arrive soon...

75
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:49,716
We're going to have to
look into getting you help.

76
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,625
Believe me, I want this baby to
come out as much as you do.

77
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,519
Now as soon as that moment comes,

78
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:56,902
your mother and I are
heading straight back to Paris.

79
00:03:57,316 --> 00:03:59,619
So are you coming with us?
What are your plans?

80
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:02,929
Nothing, beyond having a second date
with Cameron this afternoon

81
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:05,793
and staying as far away as possible
from the Empire State Building.

82
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:08,539
What's the Empire State Building
have to do with anything?

83
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:11,625
<i>An Affair to Remember</i> was on TCM
last night. It gave me nightmares.

84
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:14,311
Blair loves
the Empire State Building,

85
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:16,759
even though she doesn't want to,
and she should just admit it

86
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:18,286
and make all our life easier.

87
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:20,467
Miss Blair loves nothing,

88
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,385
except for shoes, clothes and
anything Harry Winston.

89
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:28,220
Now, Dorota, would you please get me
some steamed milk? This is ice cold.

90
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,551
Actually, no. I will help you.

91
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:37,174
Since it appears
you have taken an interest

92
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:40,229
in the deadline
a certain Bass-hat set for me,

93
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:43,602
- I'm calling you into service.
- But I already ironed your sheets

94
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:47,708
And alphabetized shoes by designer,
like you ask. What more is there to do?

95
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,998
I'm ordering you to chaperone
my date with Cameron.

96
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:53,198
I need to make sure that

97
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:55,461
I don't go anywhere near that
stupid art deco landmark.

98
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:01,425
I defriend
Mr. Chuck in Facebook and in life.

99
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:04,672
But this is pretty
romantic thing he's doing.

100
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,039
If not going means never
having Chuck in your life again,

101
00:05:09,814 --> 00:05:11,520
are you prepared to live like that?

102
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,728
Yes.

103
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:14,563
But even if I'm not,

104
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,261
if you let me go near 34th street,
there won't be a miracle but a massacre.

105
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:19,693
Now...

106
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,279
Put on your walking shoes.
We're going on a date.

107
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,041
Georgina Sparks?

108
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:37,127
Is that you?

109
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,791
Nice hotel, by the way...
for the Upper West Side.

110
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,576
I hope you're not here to hurt me.

111
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:45,746
"Operation ditch the bitch in Belarus"
was Blair's idea.

112
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,347
I don't want revenge.

113
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:50,330
I need help. I'm scared.

114
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:52,599
Even if I believed you,
I wouldn't care.

115
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,020
This isn't like the other times.

116
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,225
The Russians don't mess around.

117
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,804
It's really cold there,

118
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:01,944
and there's, like, barely any designer
jeans, and the average citizen

119
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,214
drinks about 38 pints
of pure alcohol a year.

120
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:07,536
Unless a one-way ticket on the "Siberian
express" is what you're looking for,

121
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,118
I'm out.

122
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:11,704
So if you wouldn't mind,
I have some business to attend to.

123
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:14,039
I could just wait here
until you get back?

124
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,624
Or I could see you out now.

125
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,877
It's either me or security.

126
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,280
What time is it?

127
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:16,783
It's later than either of us
wants it to be.

128
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:19,563
By that, I mean morning.

129
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:21,357
Oh, my gosh.

130
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,287
That's not usually the reaction I hope
for when waking up next to a woman.

131
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,529
It's not that and you know it.

132
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,457
- Last night...
- Don't even finish those words,

133
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:35,456
unless they end with "was a mistake."
I mean, right?

134
00:07:36,638 --> 00:07:38,562
Right. My thoughts exactly.

135
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:41,008
We're both in relationships.

136
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,545
Yeah. It was totally meaningless.

137
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,037
We just fell asleep.

138
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,091
Yeah, after an entire bottle of wine

139
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:49,394
And a whole lot of talking.

140
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:51,135
And one kiss.

141
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:54,790
Did that even happen?
I'm not sure.

142
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,275
All I remember is
you falling asleep on my arm,

143
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:01,690
and then my not being able to move it.
In fact, I don't even know if I can.

144
00:08:02,227 --> 00:08:04,875
I was just upset,
and you were there for me.

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,376
It was a couple of friends

146
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:09,423
falling into a comfortable pattern
for a minute... or ten.

147
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:11,471
- And I love Nate.
- I love Vanessa.

148
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,830
Do we have to tell anyone?

149
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,035
No.

150
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,241
There's no reason
to explode our whole world

151
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:21,346
Just for some meaningless
kiss between old friends.

152
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:23,933
Whatever this was, it's
just between us.

153
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:26,755
It's not like
we can't keep that safe.

154
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:29,621
Call me if you need anything.

155
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:31,853
- Okay. All right. Bye.
- Bye.

156
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,096
That was a mistake.
It was random.

157
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:35,931
- It was gravity.
- Okay.

158
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,341
You were going going for the hug.
I went for the...

159
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,869
<i>Spotted... a family reunion</i>

160
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,939
<i>only Faulkner would approve of.</i>

161
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:54,694
<i>I used to think that
S. and lonely boy</i>

162
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:57,280
<i>were the most boring couple
on the Upper East Side.</i>

163
00:08:57,903 --> 00:09:00,205
<i>But what makes them
actually great together?</i>

164
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:07,742
<i> Is when they're supposed
to be with other people.</i>

165
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,560
76th and 5th, please.

166
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:41,833
Actually, make that
the Empire Hotel, and quick.

167
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:46,768
<i>Good luck talking
your way out of this one, S.</i>

168
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:59,707
- I hope you're on your way to see Nate.
- You saw the blast?

169
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,715
Yes, and although
I'm inclined to say

170
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,551
that she doesn't know what she's saying,
since she also posted some blurry photo

171
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:07,606
of a mail-order bride
and said it was Georgina,

172
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,733
that really did look
like you and Humphrey.

173
00:10:10,037 --> 00:10:13,278
Isn't that a little '08,
like maxi dresses and Miley Cyrus?

174
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,282
We all try on old clothes
from time to time,

175
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,166
We may be
surprised when they still fit,

176
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,405
but that doesn't mean
we should wear them again, ever.

177
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,973
Nothing happened.

178
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:26,708
And as for the photo,
it was obviously the work of Jenny.

179
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,087
I knew she hated me,
but apparently she hates Dan, too.

180
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:33,664
<i>I wish she would hole up in Brooklyn
and leave the rest of us alone.</i>

181
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:35,926
Brooklyn. Is that where
she is right now?

182
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:39,555
I guess so. Look, I gotta go call Dan
and make sure he knows what's going on.

183
00:10:39,924 --> 00:10:40,924
<i>Bye.</i>

184
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,287
We have to get off this island.

185
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:54,512
Cameron, would you mind
if we made a little detour?

186
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:56,574
How little?

187
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,414
So now that our morning seems to have
made it all over Manhattan...

188
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,590
Yeah, I saw that.

189
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:09,418
I just wanna make sure
we're still on the same page.

190
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,363
Absolutely. I don't wanna jeopardize

191
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:13,683
my friendship with Nate
or my relationship with vanessa

192
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:16,503
just as much as you don't want to
jeopardize your relationship with Nate

193
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:19,177
or your friendship with vanessa.
Are you friends with vanessa?

194
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,556
Friendly enough to not want her
to get upset over a meaningless kiss.

195
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,460
I mean, it was meaningless, right?

196
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:25,790
Dan, is that you?

197
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:28,015
You know, I gotta go. Good luck.

198
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,766
Was that my Lincoln Hawk
t-shirt Serena was wearing?

199
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,235
- You saw "Gossip girl"?
- I kinda glanced over Eric's shoulder.

200
00:11:35,622 --> 00:11:38,447
Have you seen Jenny? I need to talk
to her about why she took that picture.

201
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,056
I thought she was with you.

202
00:11:40,181 --> 00:11:42,364
No, she wasn't there when I woke up

203
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:45,933
she wasn't there when I went to sleep
either, which wasn't until, like, 4:00.

204
00:11:46,058 --> 00:11:48,435
I wish I didn't have to say this,
but she's out of control.

205
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,779
Yesterday, it was your marriage,
and today

206
00:11:50,904 --> 00:11:53,600
it's Nate and Serena, Vanessa and me.
She's gotta be stopped.

207
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:57,675
We should go wait for her at the loft.
She's bound to show up there.

208
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:12,416
- Have you seen Nate?
- I have no idea where he is,

209
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,423
Though I do have a good
idea where you've been.

210
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:19,145
Look, before you go
and use whatever line you've prepared,

211
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,320
Think hard.

212
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,644
Nate knows who he loves
and what he wants.

213
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:25,827
So unless you can say the same,
look him in the eye and tell him that

214
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,595
or stop playing games.

215
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:31,874
<i>Courage, ma soeur.</i>

216
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:33,816
Please.

217
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,925
I wish I could say
I was happy to see you.

218
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,805
Nothing happened with Dan.
We just fell asleep talking.

219
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,224
- Oh, really?
- Nate, you and I both screwed up.

220
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,102
I only turned to Dan
because I was mad at you

221
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,229
for calling the cops on my father.

222
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:55,065
And what your dad did
was really wrong, Serena.

223
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,025
That was not for you to decide.

224
00:13:00,944 --> 00:13:01,947
I love you.

225
00:13:02,654 --> 00:13:04,991
I just wanna make things work again.

226
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,320
Nothing happened?

227
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,248
Nothing happened.

228
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,960
I just wanna go back to being us.

229
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:17,154
I know that it'll be hard,

230
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:19,423
but I do wanna try.

231
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:31,399
Blair. What are you doing here?

232
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:34,563
Someone has to give you
the smackdown you so richly deserve.

233
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:37,607
That's it me who gets to do
it is just the cherry on top.

234
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:40,815
Bring it on.

235
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:44,656
I knew when I sent the blast
there'd be fallout.

236
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:46,741
When are you gonna get it?

237
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:49,786
For three years, you've tried
to worm your way into our world,

238
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,404
but you will never be a part of it,
no matter what you do.

239
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:56,934
This isn't copycat
dressing at constance

240
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:59,744
or dumping dairy on your best friend
to prove a point.

241
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:02,382
Nate and serena? That's mythic.

242
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,259
You don't mess with that
and survive.

243
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:06,536
You're hurting people I love.

244
00:14:07,384 --> 00:14:08,889
You're hurting people you love.

245
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:13,671
- I wasn't trying to...
- Nate loves serena,

246
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,589
Dan loves Vanessa God knows why,
and Chuck loves me.

247
00:14:17,714 --> 00:14:19,014
But, you, Jenny?

248
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:21,739
No one loves you, except your daddy.

249
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,571
And after what you pulled yesterday,

250
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:26,865
who knows if that's
even true anymore?

251
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:34,765
I guess you'll find out now.

252
00:14:39,465 --> 00:14:42,089
- It's so beautiful. I can't believe it.
- Are you okay?

253
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,008
- The life growing inside of you.
- I'm in luck!

254
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,594
- Two smackdowns for the price of none.
- What are you doing?

255
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,794
Don't screw up Nate and Serena.

256
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,681
- Nothing happened.
- So said Serena,

257
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,862
but I'm thinking she left
a little something out.

258
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:55,987
All right.

259
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,734
Say life is giving you signs, and
you're ignoring them because

260
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:05,748
you're afraid of the thing
they're signaling you to do.

261
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:08,573
But you Think "What if
these signs are here for a reason,

262
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,742
and ignoring them just
makes me a coward?"

263
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,693
Signs are for the religious,
the superstitious and the lower class.

264
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:16,718
I don't believe in them
and neither should you.

265
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,130
Damn you, Chuck Bass.
Damn you to hell.

266
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:27,634
Why... When did we start
talking about Chuck Bass?

267
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:32,057
<i>Spotted atop the Empire...
State Building, that is...</i>

268
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,105
<i>A boy billionaire, flowers in hand.</i>

269
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:37,962
<i>Oh, chuck.</i>

270
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,339
<i>If you could only see to brooklyn,</i>

271
00:15:40,464 --> 00:15:42,914
<i>You might turn
that frown upside down.</i>

272
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,763
Okay, Dorota.
We got a deadline to make.

273
00:15:49,476 --> 00:15:50,726
My water break.

274
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,645
- Oh, my god. Holy... Okay.
- All right, come on. This way.

275
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,370
Slowly. A little faster.

276
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,500
<i>Then again, maybe you should
guard your heart.</i>

277
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:01,626
Lennox Hill hospital right now.

278
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,130
<i>Dorota's water might not be
the only thing breaking tonight.</i>

279
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,178
I spoke to your mother this morning,

280
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:14,824
And we decided that you should spend

281
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:19,165
the summer in Hudson
and finish high school there next year.

282
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,903
- What?
- I thought you'd be happy.

283
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:23,690
It's a fresh start...
somewhere without mean girls

284
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,708
and drug dealing boyfriends
and "Gossip girl."

285
00:16:26,973 --> 00:16:27,973
Dad...

286
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:31,531
The city's all I have.

287
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:35,489
- If I leave, I have nothing.
- I'm sorry.

288
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,538
That's the way it's gonna be.
It's done.

289
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:56,181
- Dorota, did I miss it?
- Of course not.

290
00:16:59,343 --> 00:17:03,271
Now, you have at your service one of
the best lamaze coaches in the world.

291
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:06,254
I've been present at the
labor of many of my clients.

292
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:08,086
One of them didn't know
she was pregnant.

293
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:09,311
Hello, dear.

294
00:17:10,414 --> 00:17:11,988
You must go now, Miss Blair.

295
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,406
If you don't arrive before 7,
he will be gone forever.

296
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:18,578
- No, I can't leave you.
- I have plenty help.

297
00:17:18,968 --> 00:17:20,918
Please. You have my blessing.

298
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,625
We both get what we want now.

299
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:25,101
Go.

300
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:28,004
Okay. I'll be back.

301
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:31,091
- Where's she going?
- What's that about?

302
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,885
- Nate's getting...
- Sorry! I can't talk!

303
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,503
I have to go!
I hope I'm not too late!

304
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:44,317
- I've been feeling guilty all day.
- Yeah, I know. I got your text.

305
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:46,815
I'm not sure right now
is the right time to tell Nate.

306
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,362
There are babies being born and water
is breaking, and I don't even know

307
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:53,738
- what we would say to him anyway.
- You don't have to say anything.

308
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,448
I think I already know.

309
00:17:58,197 --> 00:17:59,297
Blair. Stop.

310
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,790
Georgina?

311
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,209
What are you doing here?

312
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,081
I followed your mom and
Cyrus from your apartment.

313
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:10,656
I need to talk to you.
I'm in trouble.

314
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,340
Big trouble.

315
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,427
And while it warms my heart
hearing that, I'm late.

316
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:19,180
Good-bye, Georgina.
May God save your soul... Again.

317
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:24,125
No, a kiss is not nothing. People don't
kiss because they're upset.

318
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:27,057
People kiss because
they have feelings for each other.

319
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,492
- So do you?
- That's ridiculous.

320
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:31,860
I'm with you, and...
and he's with vanessa.

321
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,539
What about vanessa?

322
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:36,215
I seriously doubt she's reading
Gossip girl in Haiti.

323
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,035
But just in case she is, maybe you
should call her, bring her up to speed.

324
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,840
- Don't threaten him.
- Please. I can stand up for myself.

325
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:44,873
Really? Because you're
awfully quiet right now.

326
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,141
It's because he knows I'm right.

327
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,212
It's time! The baby is coming!

328
00:18:58,195 --> 00:18:59,495
<i>Come on, Dorota!</i>

329
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:01,595
Push!

330
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,851
Not enough! Not enough!

331
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,100
- It's a girl!
- She's beautiful.

332
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:03,169
Hi. I'm meeting a young man here...

333
00:20:03,294 --> 00:20:06,294
Probably in a bow tie,
possibly carrying peonies.

334
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:25,675
Nate?

335
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:38,236
- Chuck, what are you doing?
- Trying to forget.

336
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:44,075
I did the most romantic thing
I could think of, and it didn't work.

337
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,303
It was never going to.

338
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:49,817
I'm sorry.

339
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:54,014
Well...

340
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:56,439
I guess if nate's not here, I'll go.

341
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,508
Not that I really have
anywhere to go.

342
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,676
You can stay here if you want.

343
00:21:03,351 --> 00:21:05,680
It's not like
you haven't done it before.

344
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:09,505
But that was always with Nate,
playing video games

345
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,811
or watching movies or whatever.

346
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:16,543
I don't play video games, so if you
wanna hang with me, you do what I do.

347
00:21:24,376 --> 00:21:26,826
I'm trying to forget
some things, too.

348
00:21:28,273 --> 00:21:31,973
Mostly how happy I thought I'd be
once I made it in this world.

349
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:38,446
The world you're looking
for only exists from the outside.

350
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,719
The only reason I survive in it...

351
00:21:43,187 --> 00:21:45,637
Is because I always
knew it was empty.

352
00:21:47,504 --> 00:21:49,304
Yeah. And now I know, too.

353
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,166
I found out the hard way.

354
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,290
The hard way,

355
00:21:57,558 --> 00:21:58,858
is the only way.

356
00:22:21,735 --> 00:22:23,285
If you want to leave,

357
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,010
Now would be the time.

358
00:22:27,672 --> 00:22:29,422
I don't want to be alone.

359
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,429
Neither do I.

360
00:22:54,045 --> 00:22:57,052
I didn't expect to find
you here staring at babies.

361
00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:59,252
Turns out I'm a big fan of babies.

362
00:22:59,675 --> 00:23:01,713
Everything for them is so simple.

363
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,081
They start out with a clean slate.

364
00:23:04,206 --> 00:23:07,368
They have no idea how complicated
everything is gonna get for them.

365
00:23:07,493 --> 00:23:08,493
Yeah.

366
00:23:08,978 --> 00:23:12,493
That baby is gonna grow up to be
smarter than the rest of them,

367
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:14,809
which will make him
feel like an outsider,

368
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,739
giving him a bit of
a chip on his shoulder.

369
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:19,961
Oh, really? Well...
You see that baby there?

370
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:23,609
She's gonna grow up to have
fabulous hair and a great smile,

371
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,781
but her daddy issues are gonna make
it real hard for her to trust people.

372
00:23:31,131 --> 00:23:33,190
- Wanna take a walk?
- Yeah.

373
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:51,345
And this baby's gonna do some things
to make all the other babies hate her.

374
00:23:53,685 --> 00:23:55,255
Anastasia.

375
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:58,888
- It's a beautiful name.
- Can I hold her? I know it's soon,

376
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:01,613
but she's so pink and
perfect, and, oh...

377
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,841
Who knew babies
could be so astonishing?

378
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:05,116
Miss eleanor.

379
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,366
In fact...

380
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:14,118
Yes, Dorota and I were talking...

381
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,940
Miss eleanor,

382
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,814
Mr. Cyrus,

383
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,458
Would you be Ana's godparents?

384
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,810
Would we?

385
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,135
Paris, schmaris.

386
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:27,984
I am never letting go

387
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:31,677
of this precious creature.

388
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,220
- I feel terrible about nate.
- God, I know.

389
00:24:37,047 --> 00:24:38,783
Which part, exactly?

390
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:42,414
Was it the kissing me part
or the him finding out part?

391
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,518
Or wait, was it the part where he asked
us if we had feelings for one another?

392
00:24:45,643 --> 00:24:46,993
All of the above.

393
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,970
I need to tell vanessa.
She gotta hear this from me.

394
00:24:51,095 --> 00:24:52,865
You guys really are happy,
aren't you?

395
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,786
Yeah, We are, definitely.
But I, you know, I can't lie.

396
00:24:56,954 --> 00:25:00,392
Knowing someone so well, you think it's
gonna be easier. But in a lot of ways,

397
00:25:00,517 --> 00:25:01,815
it makes it harder.

398
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,040
Maybe ignorance really is bliss.

399
00:25:04,525 --> 00:25:06,786
Is that why it was so easy with us?

400
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:09,161
You mean because we were strangers?

401
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,764
Yeah. Sure.

402
00:25:12,347 --> 00:25:14,247
Everything is a discovery...

403
00:25:15,232 --> 00:25:17,082
This unknown person who can

404
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:19,433
do or think anything.

405
00:25:29,282 --> 00:25:31,042
That was perfectly timed.

406
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:32,995
Very.
It's vanessa.

407
00:25:34,312 --> 00:25:37,615
The good news is, she does not
get Gossip Girl blasts in Haiti,

408
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,190
but she does get Nate's texts,
and he sent her that photo.

409
00:25:41,315 --> 00:25:44,015
- How could he do that?
- How could he not?

410
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:53,442
Are you okay?

411
00:25:57,446 --> 00:25:59,390
You're welcome to stay the night.

412
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,952
You're not kicking me
out into the street?

413
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:03,257
Lucky me.

414
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:07,227
Some people don't get the offer.

415
00:26:11,392 --> 00:26:13,429
- Nate?
- <i>Chuck?</i>

416
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,300
<i>Chuck!</i>

417
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:27,242
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

418
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:30,017
- Is there someone in there?
- No, nobody.

419
00:26:36,806 --> 00:26:40,371
Excuse my confusion.
I didn't expect to see you tonight...

420
00:26:40,496 --> 00:26:41,696
Or ever again.

421
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:48,648
You went.

422
00:26:57,432 --> 00:27:00,330
- Sorry I was so late.
- I waited.

423
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:03,055
Dorota went into labor.
She had her baby.

424
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,957
I wasn't going to show up.

425
00:27:06,256 --> 00:27:07,856
I was resolved not to.

426
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,211
Every bone in my
body tried to slow me.

427
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:13,381
Every voice
in my head screamed, "don't!"

428
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,841
- But...
- But I didn't listen.

429
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:18,886
I followed my heart
because I love you.

430
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,915
I can't deny that our path
has been complicated,

431
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,840
but in the end, love
makes everything simple.

432
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,580
Why don't I make you a drink?

433
00:28:02,756 --> 00:28:05,195
How about some music?
My ipod's in my room.

434
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,720
- We don't need music.
- I want everything to be perfect.

435
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,755
- Jenny.
- Go away.

436
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:45,533
No.

437
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:49,991
We may get mad at each other sometimes,
but if you're really hurting,

438
00:28:50,116 --> 00:28:52,616
- I'm here for you.
- You say that now.

439
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:56,414
But I'll do something
to let you down.

440
00:28:57,937 --> 00:29:00,800
Then you'll turn your
back like everybody else.

441
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:01,925
My dad,

442
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,407
Dan,

443
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,968
Nate, Serena,

444
00:29:05,438 --> 00:29:06,438
Blair.

445
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,310
Everybody hates me, even...

446
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:15,064
- Even chuck.
- Chuck?

447
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:18,591
What did you do to chuck?

448
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:24,220
It was such a mistake.

449
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:25,917
Mistake? Chuck?

450
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:36,398
Why would you do that?

451
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,862
I was sad. He was sad.
I don't know.

452
00:29:43,487 --> 00:29:46,623
It's not the worst thing. It's not worse
than that time with Damien...

453
00:29:46,748 --> 00:29:48,598
I didn't do it with Damien.

454
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:51,834
- What?
- I wanted you to think it.

455
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,550
I didn't, and...

456
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,603
I wanted to wait. I...

457
00:29:58,342 --> 00:30:00,727
I wanted it to be special, and...

458
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,469
Don't touch me.

459
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:08,473
Don't tell anyone?

460
00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:32,538
Nate, we need to talk.

461
00:30:33,442 --> 00:30:35,666
I was just gonna say the same thing.

462
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,799
Have you seen my dad and Lily?
They're supposed to be.

463
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,717
No, I haven't seen them,
but Jenny's here...

464
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,681
- She needs help.
- You're just now realizing this?

465
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,224
Okay. What happened?

466
00:30:52,745 --> 00:30:55,345
You need to ask her,
She's in the chapel.

467
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,109
I guess I thought
when my dad came back,

468
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,605
that I would start
making different choices

469
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,930
and stop making the same mistakes.

470
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,991
Well, at least that's honest.

471
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:16,450
Yeah, I think I need to
be alone for a while.

472
00:31:17,224 --> 00:31:18,459
Whoa... Wait.

473
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:21,906
I find it in my heart to forgive you

474
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:25,041
for kissing another guy,
and you're gonna break up with me?

475
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:28,066
It's not breaking up.
It's just taking a break.

476
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,639
- It's not you...
- "It's not you. It's me." Right?

477
00:31:32,449 --> 00:31:34,475
Yes, Serena, it is you.

478
00:31:35,498 --> 00:31:37,973
I think it's great
that you want to work on yourself,

479
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,523
but I'm not gonna wait
to see how things go.

480
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,761
So if you're out, you're out.

481
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:48,572
That's fair.

482
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,393
Nate, I love you.

483
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:53,987
I really do.

484
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,332
But if we're ever gonna have
a real chance, this is the only way.

485
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,397
Despite the false start earlier,

486
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,310
this night is perfect.

487
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,814
There is one thing
that would make it even better.

488
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,447
I am so sorry
for the pain I've caused you.

489
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,285
And I know I can't take it back,
but I wanna try and make it up to you,

490
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,164
even if it takes me
the rest of my life.

491
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,666
Blair, will you...

492
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,089
Humphrey!
Have you lost your mind?!

493
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,547
- What the hell are you doing?!
- You, Tell Her.

494
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,593
Tell me what?
What's going on?

495
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,829
- You didn't.
- Blair.

496
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,322
You did.

497
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,166
You.

498
00:33:17,556 --> 00:33:18,662
Get out of here now.

499
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:21,790
And not just out of this hospital,

500
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,422
but off this island.

501
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,253
Go and never come back,

502
00:33:26,794 --> 00:33:29,632
because if you ever set foot
in Manhattan again, I will know...

503
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,465
And I will destroy you.

504
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,511
Blair, I'm sorry.

505
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,015
You have no reason to be sorry.
This begins and ends with Chuck.

506
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,019
Who's hungry?

507
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,787
I got enough bagel chips
to feed an...

508
00:33:47,195 --> 00:33:48,738
What'd I just walk into?

509
00:33:49,443 --> 00:33:50,190
Dad.

510
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,281
- Rufus.
- Come here. Let's go sit.

511
00:34:01,657 --> 00:34:02,498
You okay?

512
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,937
Hey, let me walk you home.

513
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,637
I thought
you didn't love me anymore.

514
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,556
I didn't care if I lived or died.
Jenny was...

515
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,141
Don't say her name!

516
00:34:21,635 --> 00:34:24,062
Or anything else to me ever again.

517
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:28,141
This whole night didn't happen.

519
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,553
Are you sure you wanna do this?

520
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,336
It's my idea this time.

521
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,744
Dad!

522
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:56,098
- Come here, kiddo. No tears!
- Don't worry. I'm done crying.

523
00:34:57,368 --> 00:34:58,220
I meant me.

524
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,805
I'm gonna miss you so much.

525
00:35:01,647 --> 00:35:03,299
Your mother's thrilled to have you,

526
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,820
But you can come home anytime.

527
00:35:05,945 --> 00:35:07,604
You are my daughter, Jenny,

528
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,357
and I love you forever
and always, come whatever.

529
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:14,278
I love you, too. There's nothing
here for me anymore, though.

530
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:16,985
I'm here.

531
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:20,422
Please don't go.

532
00:35:20,796 --> 00:35:23,223
You may be a total bitch sometimes,

533
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,247
but you're still my best friend.

534
00:35:25,931 --> 00:35:28,083
What am I gonna do next
year at school without you?

535
00:35:28,515 --> 00:35:30,335
Who's gonna dump yogurt on my head?

536
00:35:32,326 --> 00:35:33,797
I'll skype you every day.

537
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:39,762
All right, Dan, Jenny. Humphrey hug.
Eric and Lily, get in here, too.

538
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:45,642
- All right, I gotta go.
- No. A little longer.

539
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,449
But I love you. Bye, guys.

540
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,473
I'm actually excited
to have an entire summer

541
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:08,332
with nothing to do
but figure things out.

542
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:09,833
First of all,

543
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,075
you didn't go to school this year and
you haven't had a real job in months,

544
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,546
so life is kind of like summer
for you.

545
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,565
Thanks.
Kick a girl when she's down.

546
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,721
- I really am gonna change.
- Why?

547
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,312
All the drama, it's you,

548
00:36:22,437 --> 00:36:25,722
like I'm not gonna stop
looking for love because I've lost it...

549
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,192
which is why I'm going
directly into the belly of the beast

550
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:30,066
Paris...
And why you're coming with me.

551
00:36:31,938 --> 00:36:34,691
I was gonna do a cleanse and yoga.

552
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,780
And maybe keeping a dream journal.

553
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:39,780
Haven't you heard of retail therapy?

554
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:43,241
Everyone goes to Paris to write their
memoirs, not that you'll have the time,

555
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:45,619
what with all the riding around
on vespas in cute outfits.

556
00:36:47,786 --> 00:36:51,707
- We have never been single together...
- Or traveled to a foreign land!

557
00:36:52,034 --> 00:36:54,040
La <i>premiere</i> on Air France
has turndown service,

558
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:56,268
And the chef
has three Michelin stars.

559
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,712
Come on. Shopping at Palais Royale,

560
00:36:58,837 --> 00:37:00,579
People watching at Café de Flore?

561
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:03,095
Oh, lingerie and Pierre Hermé?

562
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,021
Thank you!
I really think I need this.

563
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,474
Me, too.

564
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,026
It's gonna be OK, B.

565
00:37:11,514 --> 00:37:14,106
As long as we have each other,
we're both gonna be okay.

566
00:37:15,804 --> 00:37:16,601
Paris.

567
00:37:18,715 --> 00:37:20,346
Hey, man, thanks for calling.

568
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,046
You gonna apologize or you waiting
for me? 'Cause I don't mind going first.

569
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,452
No, I'll go.

570
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,163
<i>Sorry for Vanessa.</i>

571
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:32,236
I mean, you fired a shot at me.
I fired a shot at you.

572
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,877
But it was a dick move.

573
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,471
And I don't blame you for what happened
between me and Serena.

574
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:40,728
Thanks, but I didn't exactly help.

575
00:37:40,853 --> 00:37:43,340
So... I'm sorry for that.

576
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,140
As for Vanessa,
maybe if I told her the truth,

577
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:51,018
- it wouldn't have hit her so hard.
- That bad, huh? What'd she say?

578
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,480
Nothing, since she's not currently
returning my calls.

579
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,899
But I'm about to write her the world's
longest and most plaintive e-mail.

580
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,784
- You trying to get her back?
- I'm trying to explain what happened,

581
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:02,660
to her and to myself, you know?

582
00:38:03,143 --> 00:38:06,241
Let me know if you wanna take a break
from the little soul searching.

583
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:09,111
When he took off for Prague
Chuck left me his little black book.

584
00:38:09,774 --> 00:38:11,663
I didn't realize you and Serena
were over.

585
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,491
I'm not gonna spend the entire summer
waiting for her to figure things out.

586
00:38:15,818 --> 00:38:18,378
Right, yeah, that makes sense.

587
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:20,631
I'll have to pass
on the little black book thing.

588
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,813
But, you enjoy yourself.
All right, man?

589
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,930
Oh, I'm sure gonna try.

590
00:38:40,169 --> 00:38:41,762
Hey, Dan. I mean, <i>bonjour</i>!

591
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:44,237
No, you mean, <i>au revoir</i>.
Good-bye, humphrey!

592
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,447
- <i>We're leaving!</i>
- Is that Blair? Where you going?

593
00:38:46,572 --> 00:38:48,867
- Paris.
- <i>Paris? Oh, wow.</i>

594
00:38:51,051 --> 00:38:53,914
- Well, have fun.
- Thank you. You called me. What's up?

595
00:38:55,552 --> 00:38:58,293
Just calling to talk about things.

596
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,095
But obviously, now's not a good time.
So just call me when you get back.

597
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,329
I'll miss you!

598
00:39:02,454 --> 00:39:05,300
I'll miss you, too, Humphrey!
<i>Bonnes vacances</i>!

599
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,096
- I'll see you in september, okay?
- Okay, sounds good.

600
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,750
Okay, bye.

601
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:15,140
No, it doesn't.

602
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,058
Come in! It's open!

603
00:39:29,446 --> 00:39:30,951
Hi, Dan.

604
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:35,630
- What are you doing back in town?
- Looking for you, actually.

605
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:39,793
I have something of yours.

606
00:39:40,231 --> 00:39:42,713
What? I don't remember
giving you anything.

607
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,800
You gave me this.

608
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,089
What?!

609
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,469
Congratulations, daddy.

610
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,848
He looks just like you.

611
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,356
<i>And all in an instant,
everything changes.</i>

612
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,768
<i>We leave the past behind and
speed toward the unknown...</i>

613
00:40:06,543 --> 00:40:07,589
<i>Our future.</i>

614
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:11,478
<i>We set out for far-off places</i>

615
00:40:11,603 --> 00:40:13,243
<i>and try to find ourselves...</i>

616
00:40:18,651 --> 00:40:20,268
<i>Or try to lose ourselves...</i>

617
00:40:21,608 --> 00:40:23,944
<i>Exploring pleasures closer to home.</i>

618
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:39,895
<i>The problems start
when we refuse to let change happen</i>

619
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,277
<i>and cling to old habits.</i>

620
00:40:43,228 --> 00:40:45,200
<i>Dekuji</i>, ladies.

621
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:47,759
A velvet revolution indeed.

622
00:40:53,677 --> 00:40:54,870
I got him.

623
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:58,480
Hey.
Look, you don't need to get rough.

624
00:40:58,605 --> 00:41:00,379
Okay, I've got lots of money.

625
00:41:00,828 --> 00:41:02,085
I'm Chuck Bass.

626
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,112
Come on. Come on.
Not that. Not that.

627
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,826
Just let me keep the box.
Take me to a bank.

628
00:41:08,951 --> 00:41:10,581
I will give you the money.

629
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,595
Just let me keep the box!

630
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,264
<i>But if we hold
on to the past too tight,</i>

631
00:41:31,914 --> 00:41:33,684
