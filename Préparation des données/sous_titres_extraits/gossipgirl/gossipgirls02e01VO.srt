00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,200
if you want to be a part of this world, jenny

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,400
you need to decide ??? this is worthing.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,200
One year

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,900
Oh, my god! You'll never
believe what's on "gossip girl."

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,700
Someone saw serena getting off a train
at grand central.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,000
52 weeks

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,300
I thought everything
was good between us.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,800
It was... before i found out
you had sex with my boyfriend

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,200
 the best friend
and the boyfriend--

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,100
That's pretty classy, s.

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,600
365 DAYS

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,100
You'd really go out
with some guy you don't know?

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,000
- Well, he can't be worse than the guys i do know.
- Well, our kids were bound to meet. It's a small island.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,500
Are you sure it's s t some ploy
you're using to get to me?

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,600
A WHOLE SEASON OF INTRIGUE

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,200
* make it through that way *

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,100
- Did you sleep with her, huh?
- I know how long you and i
have been best friends, okay?

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,100
No, it's not okay, chuck. From
now on, you stay away from me.

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,700
- Did something happen last night?
- Yes.

20
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,300
- I'm done.
- I lied, and i stole,

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,100
And i lost the respect
of my family... for what?

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,700
I tried to warn you.
There's a price to pay.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Lily, would you do me the honor
of being my wife?

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,300
He proposed before we left,
and i'm going to say yes.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
One thing i learned is 

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,800
That in the face of true love,
you don't just give up,

27
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,800
- Even if the object of your affection is begging you to
- i'm not who you thought i was,
and you can't forgive that.

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,500
I don't know how to make things
go back to what they were.

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
I'm locking myself away
in the hamptons.

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,900
- You know how i get ??? in the summer.
- Yeah, i do.

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,600
If you want to reflect together,
i'll be around.

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,000

at a backyard block party *

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,700
<i>Unlike the rest of us,</i>

41
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,000
<i>Sex, lies and scandal
never take a vacation.</i>

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,400
<i>Instead, they take
the long island expressway</i>

43
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,000
<i>And head east
to the hamptons.</i>

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,700
<i>Some would say
summer is their busiest season.</i>

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,700
* she was buzzin' all over me
like she fell in love *

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,800
* bang, bang, baby shot me... *

47
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,600
<i>Think park avenue,</i>

48
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,300
<i>But with tennis whites
and bain de soleil.</i>

49
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,700
<i>The players change,
but the game remains the same.</i>
* now it's 8:00 in the morning *

50
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,500
* i move on like
the greyhound bus *

51
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,100
<i>* i go town to town,
and i prey on... *</i>

52
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,200
Mmm. I've been waiting
for this all day.

53
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:22,800
<i>* ...your area code *</i>

54
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,900
Mmm. Are you sure serena's still
okay with covering for you?

55
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,800
- She was a little cold.
- Oh, she's totally fine.

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,200
Mmm. But you haven't
told her anything?

57
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,000
All she knows is
that i'm s sing someone

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,700
I'm not ready to introduce
to anyone just yet.

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,900
Or ever.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,900
Look, she needed time to decompress
from her breakup anyway.

61
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,500
Covering for me
works for her, too.

62
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,800
<i>* she was buzzin' all over me *</i>

63

64
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,600
Let's go to my place
before somebody spots us.

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Your house?

66
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,500
I thought we couldn't.

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,300
There's always
the guesthouse.

68
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,600
* i gotta see the world
one girl at a time *

69
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,900
* but you're hanging
on my sleeve *

70
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,200
* like i care
that you're crying, and i do *

71
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,700
* i'm just trying
to play it cool *

72
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,200
* i got a rep to protect
down at the highchool *

73
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,800
Girls, you don't know
how thankful i am

74
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,400
To have finally found a use
for geometry in my daily life.

75
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,600
* and when i come back,
we goin' do it again *

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,600
Yes.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
* i met her at a backyard....*

78
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,800
<i>Spotted--Blair waldorf

79
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,100
<i>Homeward bound.</i>

80
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,300
<i>What could possibly make
queen b</i>

81
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,200
<i>Abandon her two dads
before labor day?</i>

82
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,200
<i>We bet chuck bass wants to know.</i>
mr. Chuck?

83
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,000
Is there something
you need care taking of?

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,300
The only thing
i need to take care of

85
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,200
Is you...

86
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,900
And you...

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,500
And you.

88
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,100
<i>Also spotted--</i>

89
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,800
<i>Serena van der woodsen
on cooper's beach.....</i>

90
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,100
<i>Alone again.</i>

91
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,900
* when i left you, i saw my name
on your left boob *

92
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,600
* now go get that tattooed,
i'll be back soon *

93
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,500
<i>We've heard talk</i>

94
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,300
<i>That things are heating up
with nate archibald.</i>

95
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,000
<i>And where there's smoke,
there's usually fire.</i>

96
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,600
<i>But if that's the case,</i>

97
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,100
<i>Why has nate fallen
right off our radar</i>

98
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,300
<i>And serena, as always,
sighted solo?</i>

99
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
<i>Wonder what she'd do</i>

100
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,900
<i>If she knew lonely boy
wasn't so lonely anymore.</i>

101
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,400
'things happen,
people change'..."

102
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,300
You know, i-I've been
harris' assistant all summer.

103
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,100
How come i don't know you?

104
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,900
I was at his symposiumat the 92nd street ???

105
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,100
No way. No, if you were there,
we would have met.

106
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,800
"...And dish up justice.

107
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,100
"You considered violence

108
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,600
And you considered
reconciliation."

109
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,200
How about now...

110
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,800
We can meet
whenever you want?

111
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,600
I had my eye on her.

112
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,100
- I-I don't think she noticed, sir.
- Read from your favorite chapter.

113
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,000
- Or did you not notice?
- Uh, you know, i've heard
that chapter so many times,

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,700
Sometimes i think
i wrote it myself.

115
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,400
Speaking of,
where is that story of yours?

116
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,500
You know, the one your
internship requires you turn in?

117
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,000
- Yeah, it's, uh, it's imminent.
- So is death. Be more specific.

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,600
I-I'm just doing polish.
It's basically done.

119
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,300
Noah shapiro
at the "paris review"is looking forward to it.

120
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,800
And calling him was
an amazing thing to do for me.

121
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,600
- Really, thank you.
- I told him it would be even better

122
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,700
Than your piece
in the " newyorker."

123
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,700
- Don't let me down.
- Oh, it'll be on your desk
first thing in the morning, sir.

124
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,400
Why don't you go home
and finish now?

125
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,100
- Hey! Where have you been hiding?
- Hey.

126
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,300
- I thought you asked me to meet you here.
- You know what? Unfnftunately, i-I-I have to go.

127
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,600
Rain check for tomorrow?

128
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,200
- I'll make it up. I promise.
- Okay.

129
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
<i>Well, well, well, lonely boy.</i>

130
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,100
<i>Maybe dating and dumping serena
wasn't such a bad idea.</i>

131
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,400
<i>Looks like it's time
to give you a new nickname.</i>

132
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,300
<i>How about "playboy"?</i>

133
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,200
People, people, i'm worried.

134
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,800
Eleanor returns next week,
and we are still behind.

135
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,200
Now since i have to go
to that party this weekend,

136
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,600
I won't be around,
and therefore, neither will you,

137
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,900
So you'd better get
twice as much work done today,

138
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,000
Or you will regret it.

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,200
<i>As for little j.,
looks like this summer</i>

140
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,800
- <i>Has been all work and no play.</i>
- You can't be finished.

141
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,500
<i>There's no way you could possibly be finished.</i>

142
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,300
<i>Don't you do anything
when you leave here, ginny?</i>

143
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,900
Um, actually,
i was hoping i could show you

144
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,200
Something
i've been working on.

145
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,900
This isn't school.
I don't look at your work.

146
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,800
I was an intern once, too.
It gets better.

147
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,700
<i>What is that?</i>

148
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,500
- Oh, it's a dress i make for the white party.
- For the vitamin water party?

149
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,900
Who invited you ?
oh, lace?

150
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,400
It's not even white.
It's bone.

151
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,000
It's way too big for you.
Don't you know how to fit?

152
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,300
- It's huge.
- Well, it's not actually for me. It's for you.

153
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,100
Um, i'm not going
to the party, so...

154
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,800
So you thought i might wear
some holly hobbie frockmade by interns

155
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
So that when i iet photographed,
your work ends up in "w"?

156
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,900
If i'm gonna wear
a custom anything,

157
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,100
It's gonna matter.

158
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,200
- Here's what you asked for laurel.
- since you did so well

159
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,500
With repairing the trim
on the dead stock,

160
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,300
Match these up.

161
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,400
Oh, and put that away.
Eggshell gives me a migraine.

162
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,500
Well, i guess now's as good
a time as any to order dinner.

163
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,000
- What do you want? Indian?
- Oh, it's too hot for indian.

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,300
How about popsicles?

165
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,400
Hey. Where's mom?

166
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Oh, she and alex had tickets
to "south pacific."

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,300
- What is that, more homework?
- Finish your story yet?

168
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,500
- Almost.
- Good. I'm hoping by reading it

169
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,600
That maybe i can figure out why
you and serena broke up anyway.

170
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,600
yeah, me, too.

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,500
Hey, jen, i'm gonna head out
and get some food.

172
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,900
i'll be back in a bit.

173
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,200
This is the first time

174
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,000
I've seen you look in the mirror
all summer.

175
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,700
Here i thought if you did,
you'd turn to stone.

176
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,100
You must be pretty nervous
about something

177
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,600
If you're willing to take that risk.

178
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,100
Ha ha, sis.
I'm on my way out to lily pond.

179
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,500
With the triplets
returning to rio,

180
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,300
I thought i'd continue
my tour of south america.

181
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,000
- I'm thinking argentina.
- Then what are the flowers for?

182
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,800
You wouldn't perhaps have
overheard a recent phoho call

183
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,700
With a certain
best friend of mine

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,400
Who mentioned she's on her way
out here on the jitney?

185
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,600
- What's a jitney?
- If that's your way of saying no,
that i'm glad to hear it,

186
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,300
'Cause blair will never forgive
you for what you did to her.

187
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,900
Who told you
that little piece of advice--

188
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,200
- Your "boyfriend" nate?
- Nate didn't say anything.

189
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,700
Good, 'cause i don't think it's
wise taking relationship advice

190
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,100
From somebody
in a fake relationship.

191
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,400
Call me crazy.

192
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,300
Enjoy another night alone
with your thoughts.

193
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,100
Good luck
on your suicide mission.

194
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,400
<i>Spotted--Chuck bass
waiting for the jitneyey</i>

195
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,100
<i>A dozen roses in one hand,
his heart in the other.</i>

196
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,200
* the memory of what we... *

197
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,600
<i>You know what they say--</i>

198
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,100
<i>A man is a good thing
to come home for,</i>

199
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,300
<i>But then even better thing
to come home with.</i>

200
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,500
* the violins will swell *

201
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,500
* in memory
of what we used to....*

202
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,600
<i>Ain't karma a bitch?</i>

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,200
<i>We know blair waldorf is.</i>

204
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,900
* take your clothes,
just take all of your things *

205
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,630
* you think i'm crazy,, well,then i may be *

206
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,030
You didn't do anything all summer?

207
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,530
Please don't tell me you jusus sat around watching "the closer"

208
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,280
And eating takeout from nick and toni's.

209
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,380
No,della femina. What about all those rumors i heard about you and nate?

210
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,570
Mnh-Mnh-Mnh. Completely untrue.

211
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,560
They just gogopeople off my back about being sad,

212
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,140
And then nate could do whatever he wanted,

213
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,760
So it worked out for both of us. You're telling me

214
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,340
<i>You didn't have any fun with anyone all summer? Oh,there was this hot liliguard that asked me out.</i>

215
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,460
But i,you know, i-I turned him d dn. What? Are you crazy?

216
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,030
A hot lifeguard is like kleenex--

217
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,320
Use once and throw away.

218
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,580
You couldn't ask for a better rebound. I don't think i'm ready. I-I still miss dan sometimes....

219
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:28,140
More than sometimes... all the time. The only thing lamerer than dating dan humphrey

220
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,980
Is mourning dan humphrey..

221
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,810
You haven't gotten back out ere and had your summer fling.

222
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,490
<i>Yeah,the triplets esquerda'd,</i>

223
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,300
But not before teaching me some portuguese tongue twisters.

224
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,130
I'll see ya.

225
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,120
James is the classiest guy i've ever met,you know? (Laughs)

226
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,190
He drinks gin martinisis and he speaks six languages,

227
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,270
And he gave me this amazing bulgari pearl choker

228
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,660
With a aold "b" clasp on it.

229
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,870
Wait,i thought your dad gave yououhat. Who's james?

230
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,700
Oh,my god,b. ( (Ughs)

231
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,630
He sounds amaming.

232
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,630
The last time we talked,um... you hadn't even n t him.

233
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,550
Oh,i know! He swept me off mymyeet.

234
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,110
'S so charming. Plus,he tells the best stories.

235
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:11,910
You're lying.

236
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,550
I am not. Your eyes arardoing that thing

237
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,110
Ere they don't match your mouth. I wasn't aware that robots got jealous.

238
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,140
Did they update your software whilili was away?

239
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,820
Come on. You and i both know this guy's'sust a prop

240
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,770
You bought t ttry to hurt me like i hurt you. You didn't hurt me.

241
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,470
Well,i will admit,

242
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,470
Waiting for you in tuscany the first few w ys

243
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,730
<i>Were mildly humiliating.</i>

244
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,370
But when i realized you weren't gonna show,i i llied.

245
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,090
Luckily,i made a friend on the trip over.

246
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,120
Boring ben-- My dad's ex-Employee?

247
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,980
By the way, i had him fired just for you.

248
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,140
Well,i owe him m erything. He introduced me to james.

249
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,230
You know,i think he might be the one.

250
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,370
Prove it. I don't have to prove anything.

251
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,970
But if you want to get to know james better,

252
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,650
I'll bring him to dinner tonight.

253
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,710
I'll bet you'll like him just as much as i do. Oh,and if by that you mean

254
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,650
I won't like him at all, then you're right.

255
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,690
I'll see you at 7:00.

256
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,710
Now how w out we go find that lifeguard?

257
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,210
But we have to stop at nate's first.

258
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,980
He has something of mine that i need.

259
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,450
(Jenny) hey. How's vermomo?

260
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,320
Great. Vanessa and her parentswere at

261
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,430
I didn't even know she was up here.

262
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,070
When i asked her how dan was doing,she didn't answer.

263
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,360
I had hoped maybe that she could help himm

264
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,640
Get over serena this summer. I don't think dan needs any help in that department,

265
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,590
And i think vanessa noticed. Is he still dating up a storm?

266
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,120
Well,if you call a different girl everyryight "dating."

267
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,670
I'm a little worried about him,dad.

268
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,280
Is he there? He's still sleeping. He was out pretty late last night.

269
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,500
Have him call me en he wakes up.

270
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,070
Hey,you know,you haven't told me how the dress went over. Ah,it's over.

271
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,440
Uh,laureleloesn't want to wear it to the party. Well,why don't you wear it?

272
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,160
Dad,as nice as it is that you're encouraging g

273
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:01,060
To get my designs out there, the white party's,like,e,

274
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,160
Last year,they even turned away jack johnson.

275
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,610
Sounds like a party with taste. Dad!

276
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,910
Also sounds like the kind of party

277
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,040
The van der woodsens would go to.

278
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,590
Have you asked eric about it? Yeah,that might be a little awkward,

279
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,560
Considering the last c cversation we had.

280
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,820
I sort of said some things i shouldn'n'have.

281
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,600
You know,maybe i should have just come with you this susuer.

282
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,810
Eleanor's been in paris, like,the entire time,

283
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,260
And laurel's been so worried about everything.

284
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,910
What if it was a waste? It's not a waste if there's time to change itit

285
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,330
Mamae you should start with eric and then go from there.

286
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,000
Thanks,dad. See you sunday? You u ow it.

287
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,160
Okayaybye.

288
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,050
(Man) not today,kid.

289
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,460
It's all right,joe. He's with me.

290
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,150
I'm sorry to interrupt you while you're wororng.

291
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,980
You wouldn't be interrupting if you'd shown up on t te.

292
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,740
Something tells me you're here e pty-Handed.

293
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,190
All i need is, uh,one--O-O more day.

294
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,430
What,the last 60 wewen't good enough? I'm sorry,sir,but i-I--

295
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,310
Don't sit. You're not staying.

296
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,110
You told me you were serious ababt writing. I-I know. I tried to write. I did.

297
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,560
But every timeme sat down,

298
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,630
It's just,there was something in the way. I couldndn focus.

299
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,130
Excuses ararfor the unemployed, of which you are now one.

300
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,940
If you won't do your homework,k, then neither will i.

301
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,530
You'll get no letter of recomomndation from me. W-Working for you is very important to me.

302
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,110
And yet,your actions s ve illustrated only the opposite.

303
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,280
Drop my spare key in the mail.

304
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,120
That i'm sure you have time to do.

305
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,580
If it's apology time, you're
about three months late.

306
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,230
Eric,wait-- And let me
guess. You want somethihi.

307
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,770
Yeah,you're right.

308
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,030
Um,does it help that the new
me st answered that honestly?

309
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,040
Not really.

310
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,970
Look... (sighs) i know i acted

311
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,510
Like a complete and total
raging bitch last year.

312
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,930
But what you don't know is how
bad i feltltbout it all summer.

313
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,670
You were the only person that
was friendndwith me for me,

314
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,420
Well,you did get yours in the end.

315
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,160
And since it's not like i
have many friends myself,

316
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,620
Manipulating,backstabbing one i can n t.

317
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,330
What'd y y have in mind?

318
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,200
Well,do you happen to be
in the hamptpts right now?

319
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,150
Ooh. A honk instead of a knock.
Did someone order a townie?

320
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,210
Oh,god. The lifeguard's got a camaro,

321
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,970
And not in an ironic
"i've got a camaro" way.

322
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,170
Just go already. Luck?

323
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,740
Yeah. You,too. Mwah..

324
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:45,150
Hey,and if anybody asks,
i'm out with nate,okay?

325
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,570
Where is he tonight
anywayay i don't know. Bye.

326
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,190
(Alana d.) * hey,deejay,
turn me out again *

327
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,780
I'm sorry i couldn't see you all
day. It just got away from me.

328
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,980
Oh,god. I wish the summer w wn't ending.

329
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,790
I forgot how much fun it is. Well,lots of
peopop have affairs that last year-Round.

330
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,270
* break it t wn *

331
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,750
Yeah, but i can't get caught.

332
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,320
I can be really sneaky.

333
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,380
Sneaky is cute at your age.

334
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,820
Mmm. Can we talk about this later?

335
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,580
If i'm so cute, let's
talklkbout this now.

336
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,740
Why don't i do somethingthat sh

337
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,500
So,james,did you have
a chance to meet harard

338
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,690
And,uh... what is his
boyfriend's name again?

339
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:35,960
Uh,roman?Only briefly at the ch althoughghat
didn't seem to like me nearly as much.

340
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,140
I have the scars to prove it.

341
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,160
Well,you certainly have
crammed an awful lot

342
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,530
Into such a short time togethehe

343
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,510
I wondnd, has blair had a chance

344
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,030
To share her favorite
movies with you yet?

345
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,200
"Tiffany's," "roman holiday,"
and of course,"charade."

346
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,930
Oh,i thought yoyo third
favorite was "funny face."

347
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,680
It is. I hate "chahade."
Chuck,stop harassing him.

348
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,760
Yeah,uh,"how well do
you know blair waldorf?"

349
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,690
Is kinda boring for those of us
who actually know blair waldorf.

350
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,660
Not to mention transparent.
Well,thank you,g gndma.

351
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,040
Why is it when y y say that
word it sounds like an insult?

352
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,920
No,no,i-I don't mind..

353
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,420
I would like to learn as
much as i can about blairir

354
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,350
And there's no better way
to l lrn than through a quiz.

355
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,040
Well,it's a shame you guys
took a bus and not a limo.

356
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,340
I don't know i iyou know
this, but blair loves a limo--

357
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,540
Sweetie,will you please
pass me the salt andndepper?

358
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,530
Uh,excuse me.

359
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,410
I think i just lostmy appetite.

360
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,680
Will you excuse me?

361
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,730
Chuck.

362
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,840
Look,i know what that pin means to you.

363
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,970
You gave it to nate the first
time you said you loved him.

364
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,600
Well,i asked for it back.

365
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,350
I thought james should have it now.

366
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,660
Do you,uh...

367
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,530
??

368
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,410
I do.

369
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,250
I'll see you at school.

370
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,190
Oh,my goodness.

371
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,660
My pin must have gotten caught
on your sweater by mistake.

372
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,850
Oh,wow. I didn't feel anything.

373
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,990
Well,nathaniel,
you have a choice--

374
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,390
Under the bed or out the window.

375
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,800
What?

376
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,090
My h hband just pulled up. Your husband?

377
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,560
I thought he wasn't supposed to be home
t tl next week. Seems he's home early.

378
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,890
(Man) whoa. (Serena) nate?

379
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,180
What the hell's
hihideal? I have no idea.

380
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,370
Damn that mother-Chucker.

381
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,860
Ugh! He--He's totallllright.
I don't even like james.

382
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,760
??

383
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,030
Only hooked up with him a week ago

384
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,380
Because i knew that t couldn't
get off the plane alone.

385
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,280
D it would kill me if chuck
knew that he'd ruined my summer.

386
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:28,000
Oh,b.,i'm so sorry. Was it really bad? I
would be in my cabana at the hTel du capap

387
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,160
And ththe he would be.

388
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,560
Amid all the fireworks on bastille day,

389
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,620
All i could see was
that chuck bass-Tard.

390
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,360
The limo's taking me back in n  hour.

391
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,940
You're welcome to join m m dude,you're
not going to the white party?

392
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,690
Come on. Pretty girls, white dresses.

393
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,370
Unless there's a
sprinkler, i don't care.

394
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,260
Besides,it's tourist season
in the city. Easy pickings. Ah.

395
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,110
Okay, and i don't want blair

396
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,350
Throwing her callboy in my face.

397
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,090
At least i could have e tten

398
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,070
A more interesting stand-In than james.

399
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,900
Do you know how hard it is

400
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,960
To find a good fake boyfriend on short notice?
Well,he was smart and fun at tea yesterday,

401
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,850
D he's really cute,too. You don't have to
lie anymore, serena. He served his purpose.

402
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,120
Now that chuck is on h
h way back to the city,

403
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,270
I can n mp james just in time
to go to the white party stag.

404
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,050
How was your date, by the way?
After a few w urs with that guy,

405
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,750
<i>I needed lifif saving, not guarding.
Babysteps,machRi. Baby steps.</i>

406
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,210
By the way,archibald, now
that the summer's over,

407
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,330
I can tell you i never bebeeved

408
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,800
Any of the talk that
you hit it with my y s.

409
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:28,324
？？

410
00:21:28,424 --> 00:21:29,484
？？

411
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,070
Nate,why didn't you call me back t ts
morning? I can't talk about that here.

412
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,030
So where's princeton? I'm
surprised you let him get away.

413
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,010
James goes to georgetown, and unlike you,i
don't lose something if i letett out of my sight.

414
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,990
When you told me your
secret girlfriend was older,

415
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,740
I thought you meant college.Not
to mention, catherine's married.

416
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,160
I don't know where you've been,

417
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,540
But your boy toy is a princeton man.

418
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,510
He and i talked about it while you
played dress up with serena last night.

419
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,050
Therine ended it with me last night.

420
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,210
(Serena) what? Tell
me. You misheard,chuck.

421
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,170
He's always going on and on about
his crew division and his eating club.

422
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,310
It's georgetown all the way.

423
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,400
<i>I know he said princeton.</i>

424
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,770
Georgetown. Princeton.

425
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,820
Georgetown. Serena,let's go.

426
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,450
Well,i'm glad to hear you're
not seeing catherine anymore.

427
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,710
Wewean talk about it later.

428
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,300
Eric,it's me. You were
at dinner last night.

429
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,380
What college does blair's consort go to?

430
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,340
Yeah,well,that's not what he told blair.

431
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,240
Do some research,junior.
I'm in the mood to be right.

432
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,920
I can't believe that i get a
job working fofomy literary idol,

433
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,750
And he--And he
cans me, you know?

434
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,850
I did everything he asked from
picking up his dry cleaning

435
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,170
To keeping him sober
before noon,which was,

436
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,880
Believe me,the hardest thing i've ever
done. Hahaer than finishing that story?

437
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,270
I i st couldn't write
it,dad. I-I-I don't know why.

438
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,140
You're talking to a guy who
couldn't finish a new songng

439
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,790
In 12 years. I get it. So what is the storyrybout
anyway? The dissolution of a relationship

440
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,640
Bebeeen two people
from different worlds.

441
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,560
Ience fiction,huh? (Chuckles) yeah.

442
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,440
Well,if i can offer some fatherly advice

443
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,360
From 300 miles away... i-I i ven't
finished the story because i haven't

444
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,670
Dealt with my feelings over
the way i ended it with sesena.

445
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,130
Couldn't have said it better
myself,even if you'd let me.

446
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,140
I've tried not to think
about her all l mmer.

447
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,360
I was afraid if i
did, that i w wld--

448
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,030
I would see that i made a huge mistste.

449
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,900
So i've just been trying to
distract myself the best i canan

450
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,420
Wellllyou've been running all summer.

451
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,180
Maybe it's time you stopped,

452
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,090
And you turned around and faced it.

453
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,140
So not only did james
schiller not go to princeton,

454
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,610
He also didn't go to georgetown.

455
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,220
In fact,i couldn't find a record of him

456
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,040
Any of the big schools. Since when
did you become sherlock holmes?

457
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,360
So you think james is--
An untalented mr. Ripley?

458
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,440
If you want enenE to the upper class,

459
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,840
There's no e eier mark
than a wronged woman.

460
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,580
It's time to call in the big guns.

461
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,060
Mike,i need a b bkground
check on a james schiller...

462
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,760
He's got a p.I. On speed dial.

463
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,320
Nate! I know that face.
That face is not your friend.

464
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,000
My grandmother just
informed me you told her

465
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,910
I'm gonna be your dada to
the white party this evening?

466
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,150
If things s e really
over with catherine,

467
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,180
Then why do i still need
to be your cover? Huh?

468
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,030
James...

469
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,940
The past six days

470
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,190
Have been exactly what
i needed them to be.

471
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,590
Me,too. And there's
something i've--

472
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,950
Memeirst.

473
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,830
Sorry.

474
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,480
Oh,what is it? What did you want to say?

475
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,910
I just wanted to ask

476
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,500
If you'd like to comomto the
white party with me tonight.

477
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,460
Sure. That--That'd
be great.

478
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,870
I know i ihouldn't have used you again

479
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,630
After our conversation this morning.

480
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,760
No,i i t it. You have feelings for her.

481
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,600
But let's just be honest a aut
why you want to go tonight--

482
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,480
You wanna check out the competition.

483
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,360
No.

484
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,850
I juststi-I wanna see her
and her husband together...

485
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,660
Just once.

486
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,080
Yeah,that's callele
checking out the competition,

487
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,890
Which is stupid and
potentially dangerous,nate.

488
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:11,980
Yeah,you're right.

489
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,340
But since i've been stupid
and dangerous in the past,

490
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,740

Trying to ruin my marriage?

526
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,230
Get me drunk?

527
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,430
Absolutely.

528
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,710
Daniel humphrey.

529
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,910
I can honestly say i'm surprised.

530
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:22,090
Is--Is serena here? No,she's gone ahead
to a party that i'm quite late for myself.

531
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,830
Uh,could you... please?

532
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,690
Oh--Oh,yeye.
Sure.

533
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,500
Yeah,if you really want me to.

534
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,670
There you go.

535
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,630
Thank you.

536
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,320
Oh,you--You
seem,uh...

537
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,630
I-I don't know, you seem different.

538
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,280
Wellllcertain things are
in remission,mr. Humphrey,

539
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,500
Not the least of which
is my former attitude.

540
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,940
Going through something
like i did changes you.

541
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,320
You can see things differently.
Yeah? Like,uh,like what?

542
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,390
Like how the keys to
someone else's happiness

543
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,400
Are not necessarily the
same ones as for your owow

544
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,390
Serena thinks she had
me fooled this summer,

545
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,420
But i know the truth.

546
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,740
You are still in herereart.

547
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,060
Are--Are you sure i'm
at the right house?

548
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,390
This party that you're
ababt to take me to--

549
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,490
It has a very strict dress code.

550
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,360
...and all of that is to say

551
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,910
What i wanted to talk
to you about earlier,

552
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,770
Is that my feelings for
you have deepened,and i...

553
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,660
I can't help thinking
that what i've done

554
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:38,370
Is something so terrible,
so inappropriaia--

555
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,270
(Laughs) you'r'rso
funny! I'm--I'm sorry.

556
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,420
I could juju listen to you all day.

557
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,050
Did i--Did i say
something funny?

558
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,240
Hi. Vitamin water?

559
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,700

00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,510
<i>So,ginny...</i>

564
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:16,030
How did you manage to
get in, and in that dress?

565
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,540
You know,,checked at the door,
and your name's not on the list,

566
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,140
And they said you were
someone's plus-One.

567
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,700
But i told them that someone like youu

568
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,260
Actually,hehe's someone

It's nice to meet t u, too.

574

I have a look book of photos
from magazines thahai cut out,

575
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,430
And you're in,like,all of them.
You have amazing taste.That is

576
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,790
You know,eric said u're
an aspiring designer.

577
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,320
Are you wearing one of your own
pieces? Yeah,as a matter of fact, i am.

578
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,500
Is something wrong?

579
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,250
You've been using meme
to make that guy jealous.

580
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,870
I have not. It's no
wonder you hate "charade."

581
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,970
It hits too close to home.

582
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,650
You don't understand.
Chuck is an awful person.

583
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,660
He does terrible things. He uses pepele.

584
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,170
And... you think you're any different?

585
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,910
I can't believe i've been so stupid.

586
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,140
I bet you don't even like me at all.

587
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,860
No,not really.

588
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,890
I i an...

589
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,360
You're kind of boring.

590
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,390
Am i?

591
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,240
Ororre you just

592
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,200
Too interested in
yourself to get to know me?

593
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,230
U two deserve each other.

594
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,270
You really know how to hurt people.

595
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,710
I admire you for it.
This is s l your fault.

596
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,230
I would have n ner needed
a james if you hadn't

597
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,920
Stood me up at the
airport in the first place.

598
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,260
<i>You made me use him. I
didn't make you do anything.</i>

599
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,140
You were just you. N't
you see? We're the same.

600
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,390
Stop trying to fight it. I will
fight until my last dying breath,

601
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,620
Because any y semblance to you

602
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,400
Is something i would hatat about myself.

603
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,490
Come on. Cheer up,charlie.

604
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,250
* we're quick coming out,t,

(Lowered voice) what

606
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,270
What did she just say to you?

607
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,140
(Sighs) she just asked me what
i'm still doing herer oh,that's it.

608
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,600
She's officially not invited
to book club next summer.

609
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,340
I don't even know what
was thinking. (Scoffs)

610
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,670
No,don't feel bad.

611
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,640
Look,it's her fault

612
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,500
Oh,i know, but it was stupid. (Sighs)

613
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,980
I just wish i could make her feel

614
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,060
As badly as i feel right now.

615
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,320
You totally can.

<i>Otted--Serena

622
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,990
<i>In a massive display of p.D.A...</i>

623
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,940
Of course.

624
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,450
<i>And that's exactlywhat
dan humphrey is--</i>

625
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,000
<i>Pretty damn angry.</i>

626
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,820
,no,no, dan,dan,wait.

627
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,840
No,thank you.

628
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,980
No,i-I didn't expect to see y y.

629
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,740
You--You completely
surprised me. I-I-

630
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,500
Well,i have to say you didn't..

631
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,870
Nate,huh? I guess even
bad history repeats s self.

632
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,610
No,it--It's not
what it looks s ke.

633
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,200
Let me guess-- There's an
exption? Yes. Of course..

634
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,040
I was just trying to help
himm make someone jealous. Who?

635
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,920
Well,i-I can't say. Why not?

636
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,970
Oh,well,i'm sure you can't
tell me that either. No,i can't,

637
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,790
<i>But that's not the point.
No,that's exactly the point.</i>

638
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,780
It can never just be a
simple answer with you.

639
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,650
It can't just be "i kissed nate."

640
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,230
It has to be "i-I kissed nate
because someone i can't name

641
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:54,070
Needed to see it foror
reason i can't explain."

642
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,890
It's theheame drama, different city.

643
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,580
Hi. What a a you doing here?

644
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,570
I came with a datete i'm glad i did...

645
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,470
Because since i know her date,
ththtwo of us got to meet.

646
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,070
Yeah,and then we got to
talking,and we figured out

647
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,170
That the other night at
jeremiah harris' reading,

648
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,030
When you were making out with me...

649
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,360
<i>You were supposed totoe with me.</i>

650
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,030
Ps.

651
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:33,260
No,wait. No,no,let me
guess-- You can explain?

652
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,320
Catherine. What are you
doing? Why did you kiss serena?

653
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,520
You said we were through.

654
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,550
(Scoffs) i can't believe thaha
you would try to make me jealous

655
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,600
In front of my husband and our friends.

656
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,000
Well,did it work? Completely.

657
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,000
So i... (sighs) i-I-I
went a little overboard.

658
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,460
A little? Yeah. It's true,i did.

659
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,930
And i hate that i'm
even able to say this,

660
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,610
But that's,um, that's not the firststime

661
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,100
Somemeing like that has happened.

662
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,550
I,uh...

663
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,600
I haven't been able to get
you out of my head all summer.

664
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,200
I-I was hoping when i saw you,

665
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,470
I would know that we
did the right thing,

666
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,500
But t i don't feel that way.

667
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,140
I dodot feel that way at all.

668
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,470
Can we not talk about this right now?

669
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,370
Um,right now i just need to makaksure

670
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,180
My grandfather's'suit from the
'70s isn't ruined forever... yeah.

671
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,760
More than it already was

672
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,330
By being my grandfather's
suit from the '70s.

673
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,250
I miss that little laugh of yours.

674
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,460
Shh,just...

675
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,910
Okay.

676
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,570
<i>When words get in the way,</i>

677
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,920
<i>There's really only one thingleft to do.</i>

678
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,270
Let's get out of here.

679
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,770
Yoyowanna get out of here? Yes. (Laughs)

680
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,760
I just have to say good-Bye
to, um,a few dozen people first.

681
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,800
Um,,you want to-- Yeah,i'll--I'll--
I'll meet you at the beach.

682
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,420
I'll wait there. Ay.

683
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,600
You were right.

684
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,160
I used you as a weapon against chuck.

685
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:51,940
I didn't need you to be interesting,

686
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,210
So i didn't listen when you talked.

687
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,210
I just needed yoyo to look good...

688
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,910
Which you do.

689
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,980
Just in time.

690
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,980
What's the dirt on non-James schililr?

691
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,800
I'm afraid we have something in comomn.

692
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,380
Well,i look good,too.

693
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,370
(Laughs) uh,not just that.

694
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,660
Um,it's what i was ying
to tell you earlier.

695
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,080
I haven't been honest with you.

696
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,440
Okay,spill it.

697
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,850
I don't go to georgetown or princeton

698
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,550
Or any school for that matter.R.

699
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,280
I'm afraid i slipped up on that detail.

700
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,960
My name...

701
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,700
Is actually marcus beaton.

702
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,040
I'm british...

703
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,260
And a lord.

704
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,470
What?

705
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,960
Well,why didn't you tell me before?

706
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,060
Well,most women i meet
only like me for my title.

707
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,560
I vowed the next t te to pretend to be
a common american and see what happened.

708
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,120
But after a couple of days with you,

709
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,600
I was afraid if i told you the truth,

710
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,910
You'd hate me for lying
in the f fst place.

711
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,740
No,not quite,my lord.

712
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,790
Um,the title is great and all,

713
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,970
But what i'd like more than anytytng

714
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:15,750
Is a little honestyy for
a change... from both of us.

715
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,350
When you told me i was boringngefore?

716
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,760
No one ever tells me things like that.

717
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,710
I liked it.

718
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,070
Tell me...

719
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,270
Oh,what else do you think about me?

720
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,320
Keep talking in that accent,
and i'll come up with something.

721
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:52,930
So...

722
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,550
I hear tinsley offered to
help you find an internship

723
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,840
If you want one. Yeah,she e d.

724
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,540
I said thanks,

725
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,750
But i'm actually learning
a lot where i am right nowow

726
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,120
I didn't think it was rightto leave just

727
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:10,360
Well,enjoy the rest of
your weekend...jenny.

728
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,180
I'll s s you monday?
I look forward to it.

729
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,840
Do you think she meant y of that?

730
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,700
No,probably not,

731
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,340
But at l lst she knows
my name now,right?

732
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,560
Chuck.

733
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,840
Aren't you done trying
to destroy my night?

734
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,170
Look,i should never have abandoned you.

735
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:38,200
I knew i made the wronondecision
as soon as your plane took off.

736
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,370
I distracted myself all summmm

737
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,190
Hoping i wouldn't feel
it,t, but i still do.

738
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,130
And?

739
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,860
I was scared...

740
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,030
Scared that if we spent
the whole summer together,

741
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,220
Just us...

742
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,930
You'd see...

743
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,100
See what?

744
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,200
Me.

745
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,750
(Whispers) please don't leave witithim.

746
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:04,640
Why?

747
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,530
Give me a reason,

748
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,920
And "i'm chuck basas doesn't count.

749
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,070
Becaususyou don't want to.

750
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,940
Not good enough.

751
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,320
'Cause i don't want you
u . That's not enough.

752
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,310
What else is there?

753
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,860
The true reason

754
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,530
I should stay right where i am

755
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
And not get in the car.

756
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,990
Three words.

757
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,200
Eight letters.

758
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,240
Y it,and i'm yours.

759
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,700
I...

760
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,020
I...

761
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,350
(Whispers) thank you.

762
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,500
That's all i needed to hear.

763
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,510
<i>They say summer love is fleeting,</i>

764
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,780
<i>But sometimes, what starts as a fling</i>

765
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,020
<i>Can lead to the real thing.</i>

766
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,350
* i fell in love without you *

767
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,630
<i>A simple trip totohe
beach could be all it takes</i>

768
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,810
<i>To clear our heads and open our hearts</i>

769
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,130
<i>Andwrite a new ending to an old storor</i>

770
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:51,330

cauterize andndruise *

771

772
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,690
<i>There are those who
got burned by the heat.</i>

773
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,460
<i>They just want to
forget and start over...</i>

774
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,310

777
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,460
<i>While there are others who

778
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,230
<i>But everyone can
agree on one thing--</i>

779

<i>Tans fade,highlights s  dark,</i>

780
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,840
