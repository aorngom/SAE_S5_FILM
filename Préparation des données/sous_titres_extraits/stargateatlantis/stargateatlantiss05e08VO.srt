1
00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:02,465
<i>Previously on </i>Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:04,317 --> 00:00:05,919
You have some Wraith DNA.

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,178
My father told people
that it was a gift.

4
00:00:09,283 --> 00:00:10,633
They picked up my signal.

5
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:12,143
Subspace tracking device.

6
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:14,225
I had it implanted.

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,035
Hives firing on each other.

8
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:17,474
- You sure?
- Definitely.

9
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:19,648
They're not pulling
any punches either.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,962
So all it took was the destruction
of my ship for you to finally trust me.

11
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:26,696
Not true,
I still don't trust you.

12
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:30,533
I've refined the retrovirus
to create the perfect balance...

13
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:33,578
Ability well beyond
any normal human, but without

14
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:37,248
the one weakness
that will be the downfall of the Wraith.

15
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:44,428
The need to feed.

16
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,727
I still say
we should've brought backup.

17
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:01,013
Another Jumper,
or a marine unit, something.

18
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:03,146
This is a diplomatic mission,
Rodney.

19
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:05,985
- What kind of message would that send?
- A strong one, hopefully.

20
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:08,822
Everybody's going to be fine
if they don't panic.

21
00:01:09,414 --> 00:01:10,991
Easier said than done.

22
00:01:12,446 --> 00:01:13,747
There they are.

23
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:22,961
My God, how big is that thing?

24
00:01:23,214 --> 00:01:25,046
Never seen a Hive in space?

25
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:27,369
I've never seen one period.

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,635
I've seen video logs,
but never in person.

27
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:33,408
Well,
you never forget your first.

28
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:36,015
- They know we're here.
- Apparently.

29
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:38,277
We're receiving a transmission.

30
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:40,598
Docking instructions.

31
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:42,602
What? No: "Hello.
Greetings, weary travelers."?

32
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,356
Guess not.
So much for the red carpet.

33
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:00,962
So, what happens now?

34
00:02:01,082 --> 00:02:02,557
If history has taught us anything,

35
00:02:02,677 --> 00:02:04,711
we get double-crossed
and taken prisoner.

36
00:02:05,064 --> 00:02:07,557
That will not happen this time,
Rodney.

37
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:09,044
We were invited, remember?

38
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:11,067
And that makes a difference?

39
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:14,239
Right on cue.

40
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,704
This looks a little familiar.

41
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,326
Season 5 Episode 08

00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:40,343
The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams

43
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:43,041
www.projet-sg.net
www.seriestele.net

44
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:45,001
Lower your weapons.

45
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:52,094
My apologies.
You understand.

46
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,265
You can't be too careful.

47
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:57,096
Welcome to my ship.

48
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:06,272
This is my second-in-command.

49
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:09,150
I've asked him
to be a part of these discussions.

50
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,150
Please, sit.

51
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,566
Fruit bowl, nice touch.

52
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:20,887
We picked them up on our travels.

53
00:03:21,563 --> 00:03:24,713
I thought it would make our discussions
more comfortable.

54
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,544
I hope they prove as delicious
as the farmers who grew them.

55
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,382
All right,
let's just get this over with.

56
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:35,523
So, I understand
you have a proposal,

57
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:37,053
a breakthrough of some kind?

58
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,390
This is Dr. Keller.
She's our chief medical officer,

59
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,649
and she's gonna explain
everything to you.

60
00:03:45,865 --> 00:03:47,397
As you may already know,

61
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:51,917
we recently stumbled across a lab
belonging to Michael,

62
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:55,113
- the Wraith that we...
- I know who he is.

63
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:57,824
Of course you do.

64
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:01,828
Word of your success against him
spread rapidly among my kind.

65
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:05,037
We are very grateful.

66
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:07,292
Trust me,
we didn't do it for you.

67
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:11,885
Anyway, we recovered a database
from his lab that allowed us

68
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:14,340
- to continue his research into...
- For what purpose?

69
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,978
We've come up with a gene therapy
that alters Wraith DNA,

70
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:23,266
in a small but significant way.

71
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:25,768
In a nutshell...

72
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:28,089
We think we can make it so that you,

73
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,855
and any other Wraith we treat,

74
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,402
will never need to feed
on humans again.

75
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:39,866
This is absurd.

76
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:44,108
Actually, it's not as big of a change
as you might think.

77
00:04:45,082 --> 00:04:47,373
Your bodies already contain
all the organs necessary

78
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:48,834
to digest food.

79
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:50,420
Here.

80
00:04:50,886 --> 00:04:52,003
Try this.

81
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:56,753
If I consume this,

82
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,969
it may give me
a moment's pleasure,

83
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,513
but it will not sustain me.

84
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:04,363
But that can change,

85
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:06,226
at least in theory.

86
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:07,810
Why would we want this?

87
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:10,269
Of what benefit is it?

88
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:11,601
Well, think about it.

89
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:14,487
If you put yourself on regular food,
you could give up all those

90
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:15,840
tiresome cullings.

91
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,696
It would give you a significant
advantage over other Hives.

92
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:20,615
Not to mention I could

93
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:24,194
stop waiting for the chance to kill you,
in theory.

94
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,332
Our current feeding process
gives us strength,

95
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,541
our ability to heal,
our longevity.

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,359
Well, we're not entirely sure

97
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,988
how this change
would affect your...

98
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:37,887
gifts.

99
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:39,848
They may continue,

100
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:42,721
although possibly
in a diminished form.

101
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:43,852
Possibly?

102
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:45,848
It's difficult to know
from lab tests.

103
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:50,359
We can't be sure
until we administer it to...

104
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:52,188
live subjects.

105
00:05:54,273 --> 00:05:57,915
Let's not forget that Michael
spread the modified Hoffan drug

106
00:05:58,035 --> 00:05:59,929
to dozens of worlds,
possibly more.

107
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:01,770
No one knows for sure, right?

108
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,784
Which means that every time you feed,
you're taking a risk.

109
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:08,260
Bottom line is,
there's not enough food to go around.

110
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,779
That's why you Wraith
are at each other's throats. So...

111
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:13,919
Here's your chance.

112
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:27,202
This is wrong.

113
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:28,997
We shouldn't be here.

114
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,395
I don't know, from where I was sitting,
things seemed to go pretty well.

115
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:33,313
Yeah.

116
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:36,580
You don't seem
too happy about it.

117
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,651
I was just expecting
a little more resistance.

118
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:40,820
Well, he hasn't said yes yet.

119
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,989
Yeah, but something makes me think
he wants to.

120
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:44,949
And why not?
It is a reasonable offer.

121
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,168
Why are we thinking of ways
to fix them,

122
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:48,783
we should kill them.


123
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:51,532
We've been trying to do that
for four years. They're still here.

124
00:06:51,652 --> 00:06:53,499
The Wraith may not
deserve our consideration,

125
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:56,044
but as John pointed out,
we're not doing this for them.

126
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,973
There's something going on here,
something he's not telling us.

127
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:00,395
What a surprise.

128
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:06,012
I'm sorry.
Am I disturbing you?

129
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:07,722
Come in.

130
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:11,684
I have... considered your offer.

131
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:14,870
That was fast.

132
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,307
I believe your idea has merit,

133
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:19,358
if you can make
the treatment to work.

134
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:20,910
It'll work.

135
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:23,613
Of course, converting a single Hive
would be pointless.

136
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:26,530
It would make little difference
to the humans of this galaxy

137
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,895
and would make us pariahs
amongst are own kind.

138
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,828
I thought you worked
with a group of Hives.

139
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:32,899
I do,
but I may have...

140
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:36,408
exaggerated
my position within the alliance.

141
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:37,877
He doesn't have the clout.

142
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,088
Then he's no good to us.

143
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:43,246
There's only one
you need to convince.

144
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:48,623
Among all the queens in the alliance,
one sits above the rest.

145
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:52,016
We call her the primary.

146
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,135
The Über-Queen?

147
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:57,063
Convince her,
and the rest will fall into line.

148
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:58,271
Then convince her.

149
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:01,442
She will only speak
with another queen.

150
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:04,529
And your queen was killed last year
in the skies above Atlantis.

151
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:06,278
Regrettably, yes,

152
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:09,117
but the primary
does not know this.

153
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:14,623
You bluffed your way
into the alliance

154
00:08:14,743 --> 00:08:16,833
and convinced them
you still have a queen?

155
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:19,500
They would not have accepted me
otherwise.

156
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:22,171
Up to now, I've been able
to maintain this subterfuge,

157
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:25,530
but a face-to-face meeting,

158
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,334
that would be difficult.

159
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:33,423
In fact,

160
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:36,911
there is only one person
who could help me.

161
00:08:44,195 --> 00:08:45,236
This is crazy.

162
00:08:45,553 --> 00:08:47,979
Believe me, this is not a decision
I am taking lightly.

163
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:50,204
Do you realize
what he's asking you to do?

164
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:53,639
Dr. Keller assures me that the procedure
is completely reversible

165
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,331
- and will have no lasting ill-effects.
- I'm not talking about the procedure.

166
00:08:58,594 --> 00:08:59,495
I know.

167
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:03,114
Look, even if this works,
even if all the Wraith stop feeding,

168
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:06,160
you think they're gonna become
nice and friendly overnight? No.

169
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,801
They're gonna have
a massive technological advantage.

170
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:12,597
They will enslave the people
rather than feed on them.

171
00:09:12,848 --> 00:09:15,141
We've seen the same thing happen
in our galaxy.

172
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:17,435
You didn't voice this objection
before.

173
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:20,521
Nobody was asking you
to risk your life.

174
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:25,466
My Wraith DNA makes me
the only possible candidate.

175
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:29,114
Anyone else would be detected
by the Queen immediately.

176
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:32,302
Well, that's fine,
by my question is, why now?

177
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:35,828
The Wraith are busy killing each other.
Why don't we just sit back and watch?

178
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,646
Eventually,
one faction will emerge victorious,

179
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:41,518
and then everything will go back
to the way it was.

180
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:44,003
But maybe not for a while,
so we can afford to wait.

181
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:46,605
And if Todd's alliance
is destroyed?

182
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:49,133
We may never have another opportunity
like this again.

183
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,033
I admit, this may not solve
the Wraith problem once and for all,

184
00:09:53,153 --> 00:09:55,014
but there are people alive today

185
00:09:55,134 --> 00:09:57,707
who will be culled
in the coming weeks and months,

186
00:09:57,827 --> 00:10:00,227
and if I can save
even some of them,

187
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:01,885
I have to try.

188
00:10:02,574 --> 00:10:04,876
If not for myself, then for my son.

189
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:08,430
<i>Colonel Sheppard, come in.</i>

190
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:11,155
This is Sheppard, go ahead.

191
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:14,717
Mr. Woolsey wanted me
to inform you, sir, he's here.

192
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,842
You sure you're ready for this?

193
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:24,844
As ready as I'll ever be.

194
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:27,766
I'm sorry. I...

195
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:31,615
I feel like you're being pressured
into this because of my research.

196
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:34,133
I am not being pressured
into anything,

197
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:36,661
and your research
may save thousands,

198
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:39,016
even millions of lives.
Remember that.

199
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,901
Right.

200
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:53,084
Can I help you?

201
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,357
Just remember,

202
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,309
if anything happens to her,

203
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:04,113
there won't be anywhere in the galaxy
you can hide.

204
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,466
Is that all?

205
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:12,882
Right.

206
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:15,688
How is my patient?

207
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,196
She's fine.

208
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:21,183
Very well,
let's get started.

209
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:24,177
Don't worry,
he's just here as a technical advisor.

210
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:26,772
I'm gonna be
performing the surgery.

211
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:29,358
All right, we're ready.

212
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,706
- When are we gonna get to see her?
- Give it some time, just relax.

213
00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:30,876
I had three cups of coffee.
I'm completely wired.

214
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:32,797
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

215
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:42,158
All right, you can see her now.

216
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,437
How do I look?

217
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,818
Now, assume your throne.

218
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:14,304
Are you trying
to get us both killed?

219
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:17,147
I do not understand.

220
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:18,767
At the first sign of deception,

221
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:21,881
the primary will not hesitate
to slit our throats!

222
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,239
You said she would sense
my Wraith DNA.

223
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:27,586
It is not your DNA
that concerns me.

224
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:31,700
It is your manner,
your bearing.

225
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:35,734
You project apprehension.

226
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:37,155
Given the circumstances...

227
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,947
It may be understandable,
but it is not acceptable!

228
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:42,943
Above all,

229
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:47,496
you must never show weakness.

230
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:52,601
Now... again!

231
00:13:54,462 --> 00:13:56,191
How long is this gonna take,
anyway?

232
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:59,304
Until Todd's satisfied
she can pass as a Wraith queen.

233
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,742
You know, personally,
I'm not inclined to rush this thing.

234
00:14:01,862 --> 00:14:03,864
She's already too convincing
if you ask me.

235
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,055
Creeps me out.

236
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:08,058
She's still Teyla,
underneath all that.

237
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:09,852
Maybe that's the problem.

238
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:12,813
Look, I'm not any crazier
about this than you guys,

239
00:14:12,973 --> 00:14:15,493
but the fact is, Todd's putting his life
on the line, too.

240
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:18,402
I don't think he'd go with her if he
didn't think she could pull this off.

241
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:25,516
- Where's Teyla?
- Resting.

242
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:28,732
You'll be pleased to know we've received
word back from the primary's Hive.

243
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:31,182
We've been instructed to meet them
at their current location.

244
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:32,458
So, what's the plan?

245
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:36,680
Once we arrive, we make contact
with the ship and make our way over.

246
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:38,935
Then Teyla will put forward
my proposal.

247
00:14:39,055 --> 00:14:41,019
- Oh, your proposal?
- Believe me, the less

248
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:44,367
the primary knows about my dealings
with the humans of Atlantis, the better.

249
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:47,799
If she doesn't know it's coming from us,
what are the chances she's gonna buy it?

250
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,851
Our alliance has recently been dealt
a number of setbacks.

251
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:52,686
You're getting your asses kicked.

252
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:54,892
Indeed.

253
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:58,346
Although the primary would never
admit it out loud,

254
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:02,696
but the one thing stronger
than her pride

255
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,896
is her instinct

256
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,552
for survival.

257
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:24,728
Don't be nervous.

258
00:15:25,514 --> 00:15:26,345
I am not.

259
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:40,311
So...

260
00:15:41,463 --> 00:15:43,234
At long last we meet.

261
00:15:44,863 --> 00:15:45,773
Indeed.

262
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:51,245
Many among my crew were beginning
to think you didn't exist.

263
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:59,179
You must point them out to me,

264
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:03,007
so that I may remove
all doubt from their minds.

265
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:07,387
That will no longer be necessary.

266
00:16:08,242 --> 00:16:09,928
Make your way to my ship,

267
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:13,017
and do not keep me waiting again.

268
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:19,109
She likes you.

269
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,376
You think so?

270
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:24,278
It was as warm a reception
as we could expect.

271
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:33,615
How'd it go?

272
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:35,458
Apparently, quite well.

273
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,000
They're preparing a shuttle
to take me over to the other Hive.

274
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:41,589
You know we can pull the plug anytime
you want, you just give us the word.

275
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,409
No.

276
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:45,050
We've come this far.
I intend to go through with this.

277
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,968
Well, we'll be right here.
Anything goes wrong, we'll get you out.

278
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,430
- But nothing's going to.
- No, but I'm just saying, if it does...

279
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,644
Which it won't.

280
00:16:56,664 --> 00:16:58,103
Just be careful over there.

281
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:29,218
Welcome to my ship.

282
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:34,453
- Where is your Queen?
- You will meet her in time.

283
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,850
Inform the bridge they're onboard.

284
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:39,751
Take us to hyperspace.

285
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,316
This was not part of the agreement.

286
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:48,347
You did not expect us
to conduct this meeting here,

287
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,364
within weapons range of your Hive?

288
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:53,159
We are part of the same alliance.

289
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,869
Unless you do not trust us?

290
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:02,759
I make it a practice
to trust no one I do not know.

291
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:05,838
It is how the Queen wishes it.

292
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:10,968
Follow me.

293
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:12,821
Please.

294
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:34,149
- What's going on?
- The Hive just went into hyperspace.

295
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,453
- What? That wasn't part of the deal.
- No, it was not.

296
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:39,747
- Where'd they go?
- I do not know.

297
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:42,531
- There is no way to track them.
- He's lying.

298
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:45,752
Uh, Ronon?

299
00:18:46,748 --> 00:18:49,256
I assure you,
I know nothing of this.

300
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,484
Ronon...

301
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:59,767
It appears we have no choice
but to trust each other.

302
00:19:09,663 --> 00:19:11,660
The Queen shall see you shortly.

303
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:17,785
What have you done?

304
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:20,521
I swear
I did not expect this to happen.

305
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,241
We're in no danger.

306
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,553
If the queen did not believe us,
we'd be dead already.

307
00:19:24,673 --> 00:19:27,961
And if she begins to suspect?
We are trapped on this ship.

308
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:31,487
Everything will be fine,
provided you continue to play your part.

309
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:33,175
We must proceed as planned.

310
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:37,657
What is he doing here?

311
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,364
I thought his presence
would be useful,

312
00:19:43,484 --> 00:19:45,771
as he is the one you've been
dealing with up until now.

313
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:47,898
I do not like surprises.

314
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:49,761
Nor do I,

315
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:53,066
and yet you are the one
who took your ship to hyperspace

316
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:54,822
the moment we stepped aboard.

317
00:19:54,982 --> 00:19:56,675
If you were in my position,

318
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,749
you might understand
the need for such precautions.

319
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,102
Very well.

320
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:09,698
Come.

321
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:11,076
Let's sit.

322
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:18,595
What are you doing?

323
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:32,380
What is the meaning of this?

324
00:20:32,707 --> 00:20:36,164
Forgive me,
but this is the way it must be.

325
00:20:43,717 --> 00:20:46,540
- You must say that you killed her.
- Are you insane?

326
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:51,044
This is how it is done with our kind.
This is how power changes hands.

327
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:53,998
- But I do not want...
- Listen! The crew will not be happy,

328
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:56,516
but nor will they wish
to be without a queen.

329
00:20:56,636 --> 00:20:58,807
You caught her off-guard.
Many will perceive that to mean

330
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:00,230
that she was growing weak.

331
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,161
All you need to do is convince them

332
00:21:02,281 --> 00:21:05,227
that you are a capable replacement,
and they will accept you.

333
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,602
And if I can't?

334
00:21:07,705 --> 00:21:09,193
Then we're both dead.

335
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,840
What is this?

336
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:13,775
I have taken
what is rightfully mine.

337
00:21:18,816 --> 00:21:19,947
You killed her!

338
00:21:20,271 --> 00:21:22,409
Yes,
and you are the better for it.

339
00:21:23,296 --> 00:21:24,660
You will die for this.

340
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,913
How dare you point a weapon
at your Queen!

341
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:30,792
- <i>This </i>was my Queen!
- Not anymore.

342
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,794
She was growing weak.

343
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:36,039
She no longer had full control
over the alliance.

344
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,228
If you can't see that,
you're a fool.

345
00:21:42,704 --> 00:21:44,223
Did I ask you to speak for me?

346
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,227
No, my Queen.

347
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:49,727
Wag your tongue like that again,
and I will remove it.

348
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:52,079
- Is that understood?
- Yes, my Queen!

349
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:57,302
Now, drop us out of hyperspace
and run a full diagnostic.

350
00:21:57,422 --> 00:22:00,029
I wish to know the state
of my new flagship.

351
00:22:01,358 --> 00:22:05,243
And have this... thing
removed from my sight.

352
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:09,782
Yes, my Queen.

353
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:22,503
I have surveyed the crew.

354
00:22:22,623 --> 00:22:24,647
You'll be pleased to know
they were entirely fooled.

355
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:27,290
What were you thinking?
You put both our lives at terrible risk.

356
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,515
I know.
If you'll allow me to explain...

357
00:22:29,635 --> 00:22:31,672
- How could you do this?
- It was necessary.

358
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:34,064
The former queen was never
going to accept your proposal.

359
00:22:34,326 --> 00:22:36,728
And so you killed her
and forced me to take the blame?

360
00:22:36,848 --> 00:22:39,308
Had I taken the blame, I'd have
been killed, you'd be held captive.

361
00:22:39,428 --> 00:22:41,352
That was not the desired outcome.

362
00:22:41,472 --> 00:22:43,039
You must understand,

363
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:45,538
our culture is different
from your own.

364
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:48,370
We govern ourselves
by different rules.

365
00:22:49,446 --> 00:22:51,779
It was important for you
to claim ownership

366
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:53,664
of the act of killing the queen.

367
00:22:53,784 --> 00:22:55,291
You should have informed me

368
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:58,338
of your intention
to make me queen of this Hive.

369
00:22:58,498 --> 00:22:59,504
Perhaps,

370
00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:03,969
but I doubt you would have gone through
with it had you known.

371
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:07,476
You're right.
It was a foolish, reckless plan.

372
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,808
Most Wraith seek to be ruled.

373
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:11,918
They fear being without a queen.

374
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,148
I knew that if you presented yourself
as a viable substitute,

375
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,441
most of them would just
fall in line.

376
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:19,264
Most of them?

377
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:24,614
The point is, we have achieved
what we set out to do.

378
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:28,160
You are now effectively
in control of the alliance.

379
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,299
We may now implement Dr. Keller's plan
without hindrance.

380
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:36,511
Then there is no further need
for us to continue this charade.

381
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:38,677
Take me back to your ship.

382
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:42,809
Soon, but first,
you must allow some time

383
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:44,918
for order to be restored,

384
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:47,038
for things to return to normal.

385
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:50,140
Once they do,
you may take your leave,

386
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:53,628
and no one on this crew
will be the wiser.

387
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:00,163
I still say this was a setup.

388
00:24:00,283 --> 00:24:02,986
I don't know, Kenny seemed pretty
surprised when that ship disappeared.

389
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:04,300
Who?

390
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:07,578
- Kenny, the second-in-command.
- When did we start calling him that?

391
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:10,492
- Maybe he wasn't in on it.
- If Todd wanted to kidnap Teyla,

392
00:24:10,612 --> 00:24:12,953
he would've done it the second
we arrived. It doesn't add up.

393
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:16,496
Seriously, the next time we name one
of these guys, we should take a vote.

394
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,089
- What are we gonna do?
- We can't stay here.

395
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:22,505
We're stuck, surrounded by Wraith.
Not exactly our strongest position.

396
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,587
All I've got is a Jumper.
Where do you want to go?

397
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:26,596
We get to a Gate,
we Gate back to Atlantis,

398
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,976
- we figure out where they took Teyla.
- How, exactly?

399
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:32,724
Okay, so I haven't quite worked out
the details yet, but...

400
00:24:35,547 --> 00:24:36,935
We have something.

401
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:41,082
The primary's Hive
has dropped out of hyperspace.

402
00:24:41,202 --> 00:24:43,751
- How do you know?
- We're receiving a signal.

403
00:24:47,813 --> 00:24:49,324
It's Todd's subspace transmitter.

404
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,868
They're in empty space,
on the edge of a large nebula.

405
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:54,460
- What are they doing out there?
- Who cares? This is our chance.

406
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,181
- Let's go after them.
- I've already plotted the course,

407
00:24:57,301 --> 00:25:00,724
but you should know that it will arouse
suspicion for us to arrive unannounced.

408
00:25:00,844 --> 00:25:02,920
Well, let's worry about that later.

409
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,965
For now, this is the closest thing
they've got to a distress signal.

410
00:25:17,344 --> 00:25:19,600
I'm sorry to disturb you, my Queen.

411
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,811
We've received an urgent report.

412
00:25:21,931 --> 00:25:23,929
You intend to make her read it?

413
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,880
A Hive belonging to another alliance
has been detected

414
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,358
above one of our feeding grounds
not far from here.

415
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:34,661
- Have you tried to contact them?
- They are not responding.

416
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:37,247
Dispatch the closest Hive
to investigate.

417
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:39,082
We are the closest Hive.

418
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,473
It falls upon us to intercept.

419
00:25:41,593 --> 00:25:43,003
We must remain here.

420
00:25:47,843 --> 00:25:48,795
My Queen,

421
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:52,179
perhaps we should
discuss this in private.

422
00:25:57,698 --> 00:25:58,718
Leave us.

423
00:26:14,436 --> 00:26:16,106
We must respond to this.

424
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:18,723
To do otherwise
will read as weakness.

425
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,600
- The crew will not understand.
- Then let them be confused.

426
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,694
Spoken like a true queen,

427
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:27,201
but you risk breeding suspicion.

428
00:26:28,438 --> 00:26:31,778
For the moment, they believe you,
and are prepared to serve you,

429
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:35,573
but if you break that trust
by making irrational decisions,

430
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:37,807
they will quickly
fall away from you.

431
00:26:38,862 --> 00:26:40,519
What about your ship?

432
00:26:40,905 --> 00:26:42,847
It is probably already on its way.

433
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:45,815
They will pick up on our new location
as soon as they arrive.

434
00:26:48,165 --> 00:26:50,304
Inform the bridge to set a course.

435
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:55,208
Now, Kenny's right
about one thing...

436
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,159
The second we drop
out of hyperspace,

437
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,472
the primary's Hive ship's
going to know something's up.

438
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:02,165
We drop out early,
go the rest of the way by Jumper.

439
00:27:02,468 --> 00:27:04,097
That's going to take too long.

440
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:05,631
We need a diversion.

441
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:09,506
- So, what kind of a diversion?
- You thinking what I'm thinking?

442
00:27:09,937 --> 00:27:13,301
Yeah, but I don't think we can rely
on Kenny to give the order, though.

443
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,136
We don't give him a choice.

444
00:27:15,524 --> 00:27:17,832
What are you talking about?
What order?

445
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:20,325
No, wait. You're not thinking
about attacking the other ship?

446
00:27:20,445 --> 00:27:22,326
Look, it's the only way
to keep them occupied

447
00:27:22,446 --> 00:27:24,534
long enough to get on board,
get Teyla, and get back.

448
00:27:24,654 --> 00:27:27,446
But it's also incredibly risky.
Either of the ships could be destroyed.

449
00:27:27,566 --> 00:27:30,902
Well, we'll just make sure we get her
out of there before that happens.

450
00:27:32,744 --> 00:27:35,698
Look, I realize the odds
aren't exactly in our favor, Rodney,

451
00:27:36,098 --> 00:27:39,848
but the longer we wait to get Teyla,
the more likely it is we never will.

452
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:42,080
We just have to keep
all of our options open.

453
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:55,427
We have reached the feeding ground.

454
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:58,983
They will attempt
to negotiate a concession,

455
00:27:59,153 --> 00:28:00,891
but you must stand firm.

456
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:03,676
They may even threaten to attack,

457
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:07,879
but they will not want to fight
any more than we do.

458
00:28:11,444 --> 00:28:13,538
The other Hive is trying to contact us.

459
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,237
Ignore them. Charge weapons.

460
00:28:17,116 --> 00:28:19,087
You wish to attack unprovoked?

461
00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:21,328
We were provoked.

462
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:24,127
They have encroached
upon our territory.

463
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:26,717
I want them destroyed.

464
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:28,408
Now!

465
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,113
What are you doing?

466
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:47,870
- What does it look like?
- I told you to talk to them.

467
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,506
You also told me
to show no weakness.

468
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:53,831
They're returning fire.

469
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:56,320
- We're taking hull damage.
- Deploy the darts.

470
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,656
Under these conditions,
they will suffer heavy losses.

471
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm fully aware of the costs,

472
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:05,204
but we must take a firm stance
against intrusions such as this.

473
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:10,648
You're doing this on purpose,

474
00:29:11,427 --> 00:29:12,628
to kill Wraith.

475
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:33,483
Half the first wave
has been destroyed.

476
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:37,019
But the survivors are now too close
to be affected by the ship's weapons,

477
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:39,005
and they can attack at will.

478
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:43,055
Until the enemy
launches their own darts to intercept.

479
00:29:43,175 --> 00:29:44,637
That will take time.

480
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,201
With any luck,
we've caught them off guard.

481
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,259
- They're not here.
- Where the hell are they?

482
00:30:00,818 --> 00:30:01,931
They've moved,

483
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:04,138
to one of our more populated
feeding grounds.

484
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,675
- What for?
- I do not know. I'm not on the ship.

485
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,307
But if I had to guess,
I would say they've gone to cull.

486
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:14,939
- What now?
- What else can we do? We go after them.

487
00:30:15,656 --> 00:30:18,112
If they jump into hyperspace,
we're gonna lose them again, right?

488
00:30:18,232 --> 00:30:20,656
Pretty much. Todd's locator beacon
doesn't work in hyperspace.

489
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:23,532
We gotta stop playing catch-up.
Is there a Stargate on that planet?

490
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,991
Of course.

491
00:30:25,161 --> 00:30:28,394
Then drop us off.
We can get there faster in the Jumper.

492
00:30:28,838 --> 00:30:30,384
How will you get on board?


493
00:30:30,504 --> 00:30:32,708
Don't worry.
Just get us to the nearest Stargate.

494
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:52,279
My Queen, our darts
are outnumbered two to one.

495
00:30:52,754 --> 00:30:55,777
If we do not recall them now,
they will be wiped out.

496
00:30:55,947 --> 00:30:59,792
And their sacrifice will be remembered
when this alliance rules the galaxy.

497
00:31:01,564 --> 00:31:02,739
What was that?

498
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:06,463
We just lost
the medial weapons array.

499
00:31:08,453 --> 00:31:10,162
Keep firing all other batteries.

500
00:31:16,024 --> 00:31:18,913
All right, we should be
coming up on them now.

501
00:31:19,948 --> 00:31:22,709
- Wait a minute, there's two of them.
- What?

502
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:25,511
And they're fighting.
They're not pulling any punches, either.

503
00:31:25,888 --> 00:31:28,399
- Still picking up that signal?
- Yeah.

504
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,630
All right, it's that one.

505
00:31:33,094 --> 00:31:34,492
They're not doing so good.

506
00:31:34,612 --> 00:31:36,912
- What do you mean?
- They must've lost some weapons.

507
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:39,395
- They're seriously outgunned.
- We gotta do something.

508
00:31:39,515 --> 00:31:43,930
Last week I was talking to Zelenka about
reverse-engineering a beaming system.

509
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,649
- And?
- No, we're nowhere near close.

510
00:31:47,163 --> 00:31:50,369
- The Asgard technology's complicated...
- What are you bringing this up for now?

511
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,247
Just saying this would be
the perfect situation for...

512
00:31:53,992 --> 00:31:56,047
All right, everybody hold on.
We're going in.

513
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,210
- What are you doing?
- Trying to tip the scales.

514
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:05,316
Are you nuts? They can see us!

515
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:19,356
- Think that did it?
- We're about to find out.

516
00:32:32,822 --> 00:32:34,201
That's impossible.

517
00:32:35,064 --> 00:32:37,040
The enemy Hive just exploded.

518
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:39,713
Well done, my Queen.

519
00:32:42,108 --> 00:32:45,639
Perhaps next time, you will not be
so quick to question my tactics.

520
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:55,487
Recall the darts.

521
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:01,440
Darts are heading back.
Bay doors are open.

522
00:33:01,651 --> 00:33:03,988
All right, that's our cue.
I'm going in.

523
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:13,562
- Where do we go?
- I don't know.

524
00:33:13,682 --> 00:33:15,369
- You don't know?
- It's hard to tell.

525
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:18,482
I think we're on the wrong level.
Plus, the signal keeps moving around.

526
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:20,696
That's a good sign Todd's alive.

527
00:33:21,016 --> 00:33:23,892
- Doesn't tell us anything about Teyla.
- All right.

528
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:25,957
It's this way. I think.

529
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:42,272
We're gonna have to circle back.

530
00:33:42,483 --> 00:33:45,131
Great, I got to figure this out
all over again?

531
00:33:46,214 --> 00:33:48,781
- Another patrol coming this way.
- So, what are we gonna do?

532
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,307
We got no choice.

533
00:34:06,373 --> 00:34:08,205
- Let's move.
- Which way?

534
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,766
I guess that answers that.

535
00:34:35,644 --> 00:34:37,078
Inform the Queen.

536
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:38,776
We have intruders.

537
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:48,424
Now what?

538
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:50,354
Well, if I had to guess,

539
00:34:50,474 --> 00:34:54,145
we'll be taken in front of the Queen,
who will demand answers and threaten us.

540
00:34:54,265 --> 00:34:55,487
At which time,

541
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:58,262
I hope to have plan
to get us outta here.

542
00:34:58,382 --> 00:34:59,599
Very reassuring.

543
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,658
It's Teyla. She's alive.

544
00:35:06,965 --> 00:35:08,435
Rodney, quiet.

545
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:10,311
Leave us.

546
00:35:21,614 --> 00:35:25,001
It is good to see you,
but you should not have come for me.

547
00:35:25,145 --> 00:35:28,323
- Why? What's going on?
- I'll explain later,

548
00:35:28,508 --> 00:35:30,448
but you must not attempt to escape.

549
00:35:30,568 --> 00:35:32,107
You're in no danger.

550
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:34,446
I'm now Queen of this Hive.

551
00:35:35,323 --> 00:35:36,344
Wait, what?

552
00:35:37,372 --> 00:35:38,915
It is a long story.

553
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:41,392
We got a Jumper here, we can leave.


554
00:35:41,512 --> 00:35:44,023
No, I must solidify my position first.

555
00:35:44,287 --> 00:35:48,072
It is the only chance we have to ensure
the alliance will accept the treatment.

556
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:50,484
Otherwise, this will all have been
for nothing.

557
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:56,007
All right.

558
00:35:56,466 --> 00:35:58,785
We'll let it play out.
For now.

559
00:36:19,572 --> 00:36:20,685
My Queen...

560
00:36:22,676 --> 00:36:25,478
What are you doing here?
Who authorized you in my quarters?

561
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:29,523
I let myself in.
I needed to see you in private.

562
00:36:30,118 --> 00:36:31,768
I do not wish to speak. Come back later.

563
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:33,845
I'm afraid I can't do that.

564
00:36:33,965 --> 00:36:36,613
- I am your Queen. I command you...
- You are not my queen.

565
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,074
How dare you speak to me like this.

566
00:36:39,311 --> 00:36:40,868
Remove yourself immediately.

567
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,996
I saw you talking
with the prisoners from Atlantis.

568
00:36:44,345 --> 00:36:45,181
And?

569
00:36:45,748 --> 00:36:48,165
I may not interrogate prisoners
on my own ship?

570
00:36:48,285 --> 00:36:49,335
Oh, you may,

571
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:51,921
though it is odd
that you refer to them as prisoners.

572
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:55,498
I overheard what you said to them.

573
00:36:55,664 --> 00:36:58,511
You knew them, and they knew you,

574
00:36:59,088 --> 00:37:00,717
and I asked myself,

575
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,968
"How is such a thing possible?"

576
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:06,585
I suspected you

577
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,939
right from the moment
you set foot upon my ship,

578
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:12,207
and against my better judgment,

579
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:14,574
I allowed you to remain onboard

580
00:37:15,771 --> 00:37:18,656
while you committed
treachery after treachery.

581
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:21,293
It was my duty to defend the ship,

582
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:22,592
and I failed.

583
00:37:42,398 --> 00:37:45,641
I'm afraid your reign is over, my Queen.

584
00:38:00,835 --> 00:38:02,741
He'll not be bothering you any further.

585
00:38:05,123 --> 00:38:05,953
Thank you.

586
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:10,958
My Hive arrived moments ago.

587
00:38:11,078 --> 00:38:14,883
Colonel Sheppard, Ronon and Dr. Mckay
will be transferred there immediately.

588
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:16,554
Good. When do I join them?

589
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:18,600
As soon as this is all over.

590
00:38:18,967 --> 00:38:22,935
And thus, I will take my leave of you,
and returning to my former Hive.

591
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:25,970
I am leaving behind
my trusted commander.

592
00:38:26,582 --> 00:38:27,905
Let me be clear,

593
00:38:28,244 --> 00:38:30,772
you will still fall
under my protection,

594
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:32,317
but in my absence,

595
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:35,379
you will heed his every order
as if it were my own.

596
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:38,251
When he speaks, it is as though
I am speaking through him.

597
00:38:38,371 --> 00:38:40,820
- Is that understood?
- Yes, my Queen.

598
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:42,999
Good.

599
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:44,481
Then it is time.

600
00:38:45,372 --> 00:38:47,182
Escort me to my transport.

601
00:38:49,716 --> 00:38:51,163
The Queen departs.

602
00:39:02,037 --> 00:39:03,122
Well done.

603
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:05,688
I believe you've managed
to allay all suspicions.

604
00:39:05,808 --> 00:39:07,754
Just remember
why we did this,

605
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:11,198
to disseminate Dr. Keller's treatment
to as many Wraith as possible.

606
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:12,314
Of course.

607
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:15,606
Although I think it might be wise
to let matters settle for a time first.

608
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:17,692
How much time?

609
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:19,547
Not long.

610
00:39:20,132 --> 00:39:22,405
You're not planning
on going back on our agreement?

611
00:39:22,638 --> 00:39:23,465
No, no.

612
00:39:23,585 --> 00:39:25,818
I'm just saying
that to press such a radical agenda

613
00:39:25,938 --> 00:39:28,302
so soon after the change
in leadership...

614
00:39:30,655 --> 00:39:32,952
Well, it may invite
unwelcome questions.

615
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,937
- Fine.
- Very well...

616
00:39:37,057 --> 00:39:39,797
But bear in mind
that as far as this crew is concerned,

617
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:42,341
I am still their Queen.

618
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,676
Oh, yes.

619
00:39:44,122 --> 00:39:45,969
I will be watching you,

620
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,997
and should you step out of line,

621
00:39:48,117 --> 00:39:50,224
I will not hesitate
to make a reappearance

622
00:39:51,091 --> 00:39:52,476
and have you removed.

623
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,145
Very well.

624
00:39:54,547 --> 00:39:55,438
Permanently.

625
00:40:18,186 --> 00:40:20,302
What have you done to her, Doc?

626
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:21,685
Very funny.

627
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:24,750
How you feeling?

628
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,870
Better.

629
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:29,169
Still some soreness,
but for the most part, it's gone.

630
00:40:29,364 --> 00:40:30,373
Good.

631
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:34,334
Well, I have rounds,
but I'll come and check on you later.

632
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,550
Make sure
he doesn't give you a hard time.

633
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,058
- Sure you're feeling okay?
- Yes. Thank you.

634
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:45,815
No lingering desires
to feed on anything?

635
00:40:46,496 --> 00:40:48,084
Only on solid food.

636
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:51,951
The blended concoctions given to me
by Dr. Keller are not very satisfying.

637
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,218
It's only been two weeks.
Give it some time.

638
00:40:57,264 --> 00:40:58,267
Look...

639
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:03,919
I haven't had the chance to tell you
that what you did... took...

640
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:06,285
you know, a lot of guts.

641
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,056
I'm just glad
it worked out for the best.

642
00:41:10,475 --> 00:41:13,099
- Any further word from Todd?
- Not really.

643
00:41:13,259 --> 00:41:16,128
We're supposed to meet him
in a few weeks about this gene therapy.

644
00:41:16,248 --> 00:41:18,942
Word has it he's solidified
his position as

645
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:20,750
"leader" of the alliance.

646
00:41:24,499 --> 00:41:25,499
What?

647
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:28,927
Do you not find it strange
that as a result of all of this,

648
00:41:29,047 --> 00:41:32,118
Todd now personally has control
of that entire alliance?

649
00:41:32,463 --> 00:41:34,702
You think that was his plan
all along, huh?

650
00:41:35,512 --> 00:41:38,188
- The thought had crossed my mind.
- Yeah.

651
00:41:38,308 --> 00:41:41,085
Regardless, I think we're better off
than we were before.

652
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:43,259
Yes.

653
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,960
I suppose you're right.

654
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,611
Get some rest.

655
00:41:49,904 --> 00:41:51,867
I'll come back and check on you.
