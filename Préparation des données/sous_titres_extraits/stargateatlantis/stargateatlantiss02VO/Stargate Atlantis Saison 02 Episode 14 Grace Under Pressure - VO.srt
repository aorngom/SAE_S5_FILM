1
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,636
So, let me ask you something.

2
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:15,224
As a scientist, does it bother you that most
of your work, no matter how brilliant,

3
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,309
will eventually be considered misguided?

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,394
- 'cause that would bother me.
- I'm sorry?

5
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,731
Well, given enough time, everything's
pretty much proven wrong, right?

6
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:23,565
No.

7
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,485
Everything from the earth being flat
to the sun revolving around us.

8
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,946
Well, if you want to go back hundreds of years...

9
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,490
scientists get it wrong more times
than they get it right.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,409
Take the tomato.

11
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,286
Excuse me?

12
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:41,291
Well, after the conquest of Mexico in 1519,
tomatoes were carried eastward to europe,

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,126
<i>where they were believed to be poisonous.</i>

14
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,046
Shouldn't you be concentrating on what you're doing?

15
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,965
I got it covered. You worry about you.

16
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:48,799
I am worried about me.

17
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:52,344
This is first flight this thing has had since
it was shot down and repaired.

18
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,804
It deserves all of your attention.

19
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,055
It made it to the mainland.

20
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:58,183
If anything was going to go wrong,
it would have gone wrong by now.

21
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:04,022
It took the italians and the spaniards
to realize that tomatoes are, in fact, delicious.

22
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,274
Good for them.

23
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,359
Columbus was spanish,

24
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,236
he figured out the earth was round.

25
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,114
He was italian.

26
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:16,535
So I wonder what it is that makes spaniards
so good at debunking bad science.

27
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,454
You're not spanish, are you?

28
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,331
Oh, yes, of the Barcelona McKays.

29
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,583
Now, if you don't mind...

30
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:27,796
What is it?
Turbulence?

31
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,716
The inertial dampeners
on this thing should smoothe that out.

32
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,593
What the hell?

33
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,095
The right drive pod is intermittently
switching to reverse thrust.

34
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,181
Cut it. I can drive with just the left pod.

35
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,057
It's not recognizing any of my commands.

36
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,726
Brace for impact.

37
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:41,768
What?

38
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,020
We're going down.

39
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,356
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

40
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,424

43
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,436
<i>Griffin, McKay, come in, please.</i>

44
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,233
<i>Jumper 6, come in, please.</i>

45
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,029
<i>Griffin, McKay, come in, please.</i>

46
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,115
Yeah. We're here.

47
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,366
Rodney.

48
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,243
Thank god. We thought you...

49
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,328
I've been trying to get ahold
of you for over an hour.

50
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,205
Find Dr. Weir and tell her I've made contact.

51
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,126
You okay?

52
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,210
Not so good, no.

53
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,461
<i>Are you alright?</i>

54
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,173
I think we could both use
an extended stay in the infirmary.

55
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,841
<i>What the hell happened?</i>

56
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,135
The Jumper you were flying dropped off our screens.

57
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,386
<i>You crashed into the ocean.</i>

58
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,263
Yes, yes, yes, we...

59
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,268
we're under water.

60
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,519
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

61
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,396
Then how are you going to find us?

62
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,524
We've determined the direction of
your radio signal, but not the range.

63
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,818
How deep are we?

64
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:00,616
One, two... zero, zero... and falling.

65
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,534
Radek, you're going to have to hurry it up.

66
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,288
We are already 1,200 feet deep
and sinking at a rate of about...

67
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,165
20 feet a minute.

68
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,625
<i>Very impressive.</i>

69
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,710
Excuse me?

70
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,630
Well, we always theorized that
the Jumpers could be utilized as submersibles.

71
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,924
Yes, yes, yes, I theorized it.

72
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,383
But 1,200 feet?

73
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,469
That's almost the maximum depth
of a nuclear-powered submarine.

74
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,597
We are not so keen on setting
any records right now, so just...

75
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,229
That's a problem.

76
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,522
- Can you move?
- Yeah.

77
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,608
<i>Radek, the windshield's giving way</i>
<i>under the pressure of the ocean.</i>

78
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,902
Move into the rear compartment.
The seal should be able to hold.

79
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,403
One step ahead of you.

80
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:40,280
No.

81
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

82
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,287
The crash probably damaged all sorts of systems.

83
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,916
Maybe if you were more focused on flying
than enlightening me on the history of tomatoes...

84
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,836
All your focus didn't get the drive pod to shut off.
I'm still not blaming you.

85
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,504
Yeah, because it's not my fault!

86
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:56,547
I've got an idea.

87
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,589
What are you doing?

88
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,632
Good luck, Rodney.

89
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,717
No, what are you doing?

90
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:02,386
Griffin!

91
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,054
Griffin!

92
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,481
Why did he do that?

93
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,358
Why would you do that?

94
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,159
Wide open fields.

95
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,871
Wide open fields.

96
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,373
Wide open fields.

97
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:36,170
You are not stuck in a metal casket
under thousands of feet of water.

98
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,255
You're in a wide open field.

99
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:41,800
Now...

100
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:46,805
Zelenka?

101
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,185
Radek, it's Rodney. Come in, please.

102
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,104
Radek?

103
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,276
The Jumper's radio transmitter is in the

104
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,987
forward section, which is now flooded with water,

105
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,614
which means that you have no way

106
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,948
to contact the surface, which means

107
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,451
that they have no way to triangulate your position.

108
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,328
Okay. Alright.

109
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,247
You've been in worse situations.

110
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:18,086
Just because you can't think of them right
now doesn't make it any less true.

111
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,797
But you're not dead yet.

112
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,509
You can fix this problem.
You just need to...

113
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,802
work one step at a time.

114
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,054
Now...

115
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,931
got to find some light.

116
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:29,973
So...

117
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,101
Alright.

118
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,026
Light.

119
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,736
I have the light.

120
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:53,330
Now what?

121
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,336
<i>I thought you said life support</i>
<i>could sustain them for days.</i>

122
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,672
I said life support would most
likely sustain them for days.

123
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:05,008
I had no idea the ship would sink so quickly
or that the cockpit would flood.

124
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,260
That's when you lost contact.

125
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,136
If they didn't make it to
the rear compartment in time...

126
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,388
They made it.

127
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:10,639
<i>Still,</i>

128
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,600
they're going to be much harder to locate
now that they're no longer broadcasting.

129
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,018
Then find another way.

130
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,146
<i>Look,</i>
<i>even if we do locate them, our options are limited.</i>

131
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,816
They're already deeper than
a rescue Jumper's windshield can handle.

132
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,193
I'll handle the rescue.
You just worry about finding them.

133
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,820
I've already got some ideas.

134
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,155
Alright, we're on a clock.
Let's get back to work.

135
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,300
I'm dropping 20 feet a minute.

136
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,053
So pressure increases by
one atmosphere every 33 feet,

137
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:51,513
so...

138
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,310
that's an additional atmosphere
every minute and a half,

139
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,395
which means...

140
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,609
I'm currently under 37 atmospheres
worth of pressure and counting.

141
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,693
Oh, my.

142
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,278
That is a lot.

143
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:07,154
That's...

144
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,822
Okay, I've got to slow down.

145
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:09,489
Okay.

146
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,116
I've got to stop sinking.

147
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,410
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

148
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,287
Send a message first.

149
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:16,955
Yeah.

150
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,249
Check and see if you can get the

151
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,126
radio transmitter up and running,

152
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,837
because they can't find you
if you can't tell them where you are.

153
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,923
Come on, McKay. Prioritize.

154
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,174
Here we go.

155
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:29,468
Now...

156
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,639
Here we go.

157
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,141
There. Right... So...

158
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,232
There we are.

159
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,194
Okay.

160
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,322
Now, how's our radio transmitter?

161
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,910
Yes, I know that, so...

162
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,247
activate emergency transmitter...

163
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,498
protocol.

164
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:04,920
Now...

165
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,797
we're broadcasting a signal.

166
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,636
All it needs to do is penetrate 1,400 feet of ocean,

167
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,429
which means that a

168
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,850
whopping three percent
of the signal will reach the surface, so...

169
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,143
so boost... boost the signal.

170
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,437
How much power do we got to work with here?

171
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,691
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

172
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,025
Three hours?

173
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,571
What's eating my power?
I'm working with flashlights here.

174
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,908
The inertial dampeners are active?
Well, why?

175
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,993
I don't need them.

176
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,704
Shut down inertial dampeners.

177
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,666
Oh, come on!
They are draining what little power I have left here.

178
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,671
You do not need inertial dampeners
while you sink!

179
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,174
Now...

180
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,013
You are a piece of junk!

181
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,435
And I'm going to die.

182
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,108
Okay, so...

183
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:14,156
we know the direction which the initial radio
signal came from, right? So that places them

184
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,824
on this line here.

185
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:19,077
Now, unfortunately, ocean currents
could have pulled them in either direction,

186
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:24,791
either this way or that way,
so the area they are in is approximately...

187
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,043
here.

188
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,922
<i>Now, Dr. Bryce here has been studying</i>
<i>the ancient database in regards to the ocean,</i>

189
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:35,219
and this particular area is between
2 and 6,000 feet deep.

190
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,095
6,000 feet.

191
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,972
We'll never be able to get down that far.

192
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:42,809
Yes, I know, which is why we have
to find them before it gets there.

193
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,897
They were already at 1,200 feet,
and falling, what, 20 feet a minute?

194
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,565
Yes, that's right.

195
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,651
That at least gives us a place to start.

196
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:51,693
Yes.

197
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:52,528
So...

198
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,404
let's begin.

199
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:03,997
I'm freezing.

200
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,666
Why am I so cold?

201
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,168
Oh, no.

202
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,505
I haven't lost that much blood, have I?

203
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,719
Of course,
it could have something to do with the

204
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:22,349
billion or so gallons of freezing water
you're surrounded by, you idiot.

205
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:23,809
Alright.

206
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,477
I need to heat this thing,

207
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,231
and I don't want it to cost me a lot of power.

208
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,733
Can we at least do that, please?

209
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:32,985
Alright.

210
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,294
There you go.

211
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,336
See?

212
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:52,796
I'm not greedy.

213
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,464
I just don't want to freeze to death.

214
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,010
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

215
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,346
A little heat is going to cost me 40 minutes?

216
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,807
Is that really how you want this to go down?

217
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,184
You want to freeze me to death?

218
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,437
You sure you wouldn't rather
I imploded with you, you lemon?

219
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,939
Do you even have an opinion,
anyway, you... no.

220
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,358
Why?
Because you are an inanimate object!

221
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,196
Does that stop me from talking to you?
Oh, no, no, no, no, my inanimate friend,

222
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,115
because I have been struck upon the head.
You see?

223
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,158
There...

224
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,201
So...

225
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:32,419
20 minutes of power for just enough
heat to stave off hypothermia.

226
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,797
You drive a hard bargain, my friend, but

227
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,216
you've got a deal.

228
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,178
I just made a deal with you.

229
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,263
Deal...

230
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:46,600
Let's make a deal!

231
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,268
You've got a deal.

232
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,065
That's not funny.

233
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,567
What's wrong with me?

234
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:56,610
It's...

235
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,321
euphoria, elation...

236
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,823
overconfidence, it's...

237
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:03,909
hypoxia.

238
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:07,663
I'm going to dial up the CO2 scrubbers
or I'm going to die of hypoxia.

239
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,042
That is so funny.

240
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,091
<i>Take this corner...</i>

241
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:19,967
<i>take it over here,</i>

242
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,218
<i>move it over here.</i>

243
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,095
What's all this?

244
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,389
Ah, this is my plan.

245
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,266
Yeah, I figured that much.

246
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,142
- You care to elaborate?
- Well,

247
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:33,313
doctors Moore and McNab are here
to study the ocean on M8R169,

248
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:36,650
which happens to be under a thick sheet of ice,
so they brought a thousand-foot cable

249
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,735
and a pretty powerful winch
to lower their instruments...

250
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:39,278
Okay.

251
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:44,157
And Ager over here is responsible for the magnetic
grapple designed to lower F302s into our Jumper bay.

252
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,617
And you intend to put the two together.

253
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,077
Like chocolate and peanut butter.

254
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:51,248
Is the mechanism gonna be strong enough
to lift a half-flooded Jumper out of the water?

255
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,499
Not a chance.

256
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,376
- Well, then why...
- Because we don't have to.

257
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:57,045
We just have to get near enough to the surface
so that we get McKay and Griffin out

258
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,339
with a cutting team and rescue divers.

259
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,841
Good. How long?

260
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,092
Couple of hours.

261
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:06,054
You and Rodney have been bugging me for a chance
to try out a Jumper as a submersible,

262
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,348
but you sure went a hell
of a long way to make me say yes.

263
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,017
You still haven't said it yet.

264
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:11,685
I just did.

265
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,022
How close is Zelenka to finding them?

266
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,481
I'm gonna go ask him.

267
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:35,667
CO2 scrubbers operating at 100%.

268
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,753
Well, at least something is.

269
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:39,838
Now...

270
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,132
let's see if I can...

271
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,094
Why do they have to make
these things so small?

272
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:50,891
Look, I need to be the one on the surface
saving the poor bastard stuck down here,

273
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,602
not actually be the poor bastard stuck down here.

274
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,730
By the time Zelenka comes up with a plan,
I'll have died of old age.

275
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,863
Hello?

276
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,627
Are you friendly

277
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,712
or are you hungry?

278
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,675
Because I am pretty sure that this thing
is an instant case of indigestion, so...

279
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,888
It's the transmitter.

280
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:34,268
It must be broadcasting
at a frequency you can hear.

281
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,647
Whoa, there, fella.
Whoa, there, fella.

282
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:40,732
I'm...

283
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,568
I'm sorry if I'm bugging you, but...

284
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,070
but I kind of need to leave
this thing on for a bit, you know?

285
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:48,657
Maybe you could tell my friends where I am.
You could...

286
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,951
could you do that?
Could you go get help?

287
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,411
Could you... do that?

288
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,498
What am I doing?

289
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:02,171
Well, I'm treating an alien whale like Lassie.

290
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:06,175
Look, Okay, if you're not going to help,
then just swim on by!

291
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,181
Swim.

292
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:17,311
Maybe the Jumper can swim.

293
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,521
<i>Okay.</i>

294
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,816
The cockpit is inaccessible,

295
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,904
but most of the control conduits run back here, so

296
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:31,241
if you were really meant to be submersible, then

297
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:35,704
your drive pods should function underwater, too,

298
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:39,416
which means I could fly you from back here.
Well, not fly, but I could surface.

299
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,709
I mean, if I get close to the surface,

300
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:44,171
then the emergency transmitter won't
have to penetrate so much ocean. Okay.

301
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,131
Now we're getting somewhere.

302
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,305
How are we doing?

303
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,890
Well, we're making progress...

304
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:55,641
slowly.

305
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,100
Show me.

306
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:00,229
We started with the likely location of the Jumper

307
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,399
based on the numbers we got while triangulating its
position during its brief radio contact with us.

308
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:07,361
We then estimate how far off course it is being taken,

309
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,571
if at all, by the various currents,

310
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:13,283
slipstreams, and underwater rivers that
the Jumper may or may not have run into.

311
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:17,788
We then we add its descent speed at various rates.

312
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,249
That's all you've got?

313
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,042
You haven't narrowed the search area at all.

314
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,711
No, no, in fact, we've increased it slightly.

315
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,255
And how does that count as progress?

316
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,006
Because we're no longer guessing.

317
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,343
We now know definitely that the
Jumper is somewhere in this area.

318
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,178
Okay.

319
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,639
Elizabeth, even if we do find
them, there's no way to...

320
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:38,976
Sheppard's working on a grapple system
that should be able to raise the Jumper.

321
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,060
- Really?
- Really.

322
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,020
It's going to be ready in a couple of hours.

323
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,313
I need you to be.

324
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,446
This little keyboard is killing me.

325
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,534
It's all starting to blur together.

326
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,328
I need a new set of eyes.

327
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,246
<i>Let me take a look.</i>

328
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,084
Did I just...

329
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,043
<i>Yes, you did.</i>

330
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:11,925
Sam?

331
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:13,844
Don't worry, Rodney.

332
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,429
We're going to get you out of here.

333
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,362
How did you...
how are you...

334
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,198
It's good to see you, too, McKay.

335
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:37,659
Oh, I've lost it.
I have completely lost it.

336
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,119
<i>No, you haven't.</i>

337
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:42,831
You are not real.

338
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:44,875
You are not real.
You are not real.

339
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,960
Of course I'm not real.

340
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:50,672
I'm sorry?

341
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:54,134
I'm three million light years
away with problems of my own.

342
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,594
Yeah, well, so, what are you doing here?

343
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:56,970
You're hallucinating.

344
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,014
Oh, and how am I doing that?

345
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,186
Right.

346
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:05,354
Is it that bad?

347
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,398
The way I see it,

348
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,483
you're scared,

349
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,652
you're a little panicked, you're a lot lonely...

350
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,111
<i>you knew you could use some help,</i>

351
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:17,157
so your subconscious is manifesting the
one person you know is smarter than you.

352
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,408
Oh, I don't think so.

353
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,202
Oh, don't start with me, McKay.

354
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:21,370
You are very clever.

355
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,663
I would even give you brilliant,

356
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,374
but there is brilliant and then there's me.

357
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,959
Every time we've worked together,

358
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,586
you've been wrong and I've been right.

359
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:33,465
Even if that were true, and no one is saying that
it is, the fact that you could assert that...

360
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,800
Why else would I be here?

361
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:35,592
I don't know.

362
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,427
Maybe one last romp before I die.

363
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:38,887
One last romp?

364
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,806
Please. We never...
- Okay, one first romp,

365
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,767
but it's romping that comes
to mind, not your brains, blondie, now

366
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:47,980
- you've got to admit, I am a handsome man standing...
- You're essentially arguing with yourself.

367
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,690
You realize that, right?

368
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,317
Your mind is creating me.

369
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,323
What?

370
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,577
What else am I hallucinating?

371
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:02,953
What do you mean?

372
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:05,372
If you're not real, what is?
I mean, How do I tell the difference?

373
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,040
How do I know that any of these
readings I've been taking are correct?

374
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,125
You're not that far gone.

375
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,335
No, no, no, no, no, no...

376
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,003
I...

377
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,338
I am unconscious in the infirmary.

378
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,299
<i>Look, I'm fine, and this is just a...</i>

379
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,466
a post-traumatic nightmare.

380
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,010
So come on, wake up, wake up, wake up.

381
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:22,139
No, no, no.
See, you really are in the back of a sinking Jumper.

382
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,640
Your readings are correct.

383
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,226
<i>You knew you could use some help,</i>

384
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,270
<i>and you've got a pretty bad concussion, so...</i>

385
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,272
So...

386
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,648
here you are.

387
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,358
Here I am.

388
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,236
I suppose that's comforting...

389
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:38,530
in a...

390
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,576
terrifying mental health kind of way.

391
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,998
Why don't you show me
what you've done so far.

392
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,583
Right. Of course.

393
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:55,964
Three miles is a very searchable area.
You narrowed it down, Radek.

394
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,090
You did a good job.

395
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:58,300
He's too deep.

396
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,385
Your grapple's only got a thousand feet of cable.

397
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:04,223
We know the Jumper should be able
to dive at least a 1,000, so if he's above 2,000,

398
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,183
we should still be able
to get him with the grapple.

399
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,727
- And if he is deeper?
- He probably is.

400
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,146
The area we're searching goes to 6,000.

401
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,524
When the Wraith attacked the city,

402
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:16,151
you were able to turn the shield into a cloak.

403
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:16,818
<i>Yes.</i>

404
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,986
Why can't we do the opposite?

405
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,906
Turn the Jumper's cloak into a shield.

406
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:21,698
That's right.

407
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,991
That would hold back the water, yes.

408
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,660
But it would take significantly more power.

409
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,119
We'll shut down everything we don't need.

410
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,413
But it would take hours to reconfigure.

411
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,624
Take what we need.
We'll make the changes down there.

412
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,045
No, no, no, no, no.
I cannot possibly... No.

413
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:35,838
Radek...

414
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,297
I... I can't even swim.

415
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,967
There's not a lot of swimming
under a thousand feet of ocean.

416
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,844
Look, I'm not going to order you to go.

417
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:42,761
I will.

418
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:49,268
All I'm saying is that if Rodney can't turn to you,
who can he turn to?

419
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,109
Alright.

420
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,403
Give me a few minutes and I'll get my gear.

421
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,625
Now...

422
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:18,589
given I have a limited amount of time to execute
my plan before power levels drop too low...

423
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:21,466
but provided that the...

424
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:25,095
coding is correct,
we surface, and at that point,

425
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,264
they should be able to pick
up our regular radio signal,

426
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:28,765
and then come pick me up.

427
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,517
How much power would that kill?

428
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:31,894
I don't know. Most of it.

429
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,520
It's a bad idea, then.

430
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:34,438
Why?

431
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:36,565
Well, what if it doesn't work?

432
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:37,441
Well, then...

433
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,067
then I'm dead.

434
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,611
Exactly. Bad plan.

435
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:41,820
Oh, you're right.

436
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:45,699
I should proceed with one of the other hundreds
of possible options available to me.

437
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:47,701
Look, I'm not saying I have a better idea...

438
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:48,911
Well, what do I do? Nothing?

439
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,746
- Yes.
- Oh, brilliant.

440
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,206
<i>Stay warm,</i>

441
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:52,915
<i>stay breathing,</i>

442
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,583
<i>stay alive as long as you can.</i>

443
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,544
Give your team the biggest
window of opportunity possible.

444
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,713
A window of opportunity for what?

445
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,173
For rescuing you.

446
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,675
Even if they could find me,

447
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:06,386
which, given underwater currents
and multiple possible entry sites,

448
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:07,513
<i>is next to impossible,</i>

449
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:08,931
how are they going to get me out of here?

450
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,140
They'll find a way.

451
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,099
<i>No, they won't.</i>

452
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:14,978
You and I both know that the one person who can figure
it all out is stuck in the back of a sinking Jumper.

453
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,146
Me.

454
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,648
Oh, touché.

455
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,442
<i>Look, I hear what you're saying,</i>
<i>and I'm telling you</i>

456
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:21,235
<i>you're wrong.</i>

457
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,569
You have some very smart,

458
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:24,238
very motivated people on the surface,

459
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:28,200
and the only thing any of them are
working on right now is rescuing you.

460
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,576
Oh, come on.

461
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:32,037
They are planning my memorial service.

462
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,414
If your plan fails, and it probably will,

463
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,917
you could jeopardize their plan.

464
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,920
Are you going to help me or not?

465
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,548
I'll help you stay alive
as long as possible, but no,

466
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,216
I am not helping you with this plan.

467
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:46,426
So my own hallucination is saying no to me?

468
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:49,972
You must realize subconsciously that
you need to be talked out of this.

469
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,474
I can't even hallucinate right today.

470
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,024
Alright.

471
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:04,027
We're above the search coordinates.

472
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,320
Okay.

473
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:07,865
It should transition seamlessly.

474
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:09,408
Alright, then.

475
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,536
Here goes nothing.

476
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,013
I... I wouldn't.

477
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,139
You wouldn't what?

478
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:33,807
Sorry, I forgot. I'm not helping.

479
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:34,641
No, no, no.

480
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:36,018
Did you see something?

481
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:37,561
Did I make a mistake?

482
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:42,107
Seriously, if you saw something,
just... just tell me.

483
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:45,652
You're messing with me.

484
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:47,029
Sorry?

485
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,530
You're trying to slow me down.

486
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,741
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Don't play mind games with me.

487
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:52,201
I am a mind game.

488
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:55,621
Okay, if you're not going to help me,
just stay on your side of the Jumper.

489
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:08,467
What now?

490
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,724
Feels like we hit the bottom.

491
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:18,977
Oh, really?

492
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:23,106
Well, this is good.

493
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,567
Well, the chances of us
imploding are much slimmer.

494
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:27,361
- But Rodney...
- No, no, no! No buts, okay?

495
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:30,948
Can I not at least take a moment to enjoy the
one bit of good luck I've had all day?

496
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,032
This isn't good.

497
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:33,325
Look, just, just...

498
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:34,451
shut up!

499
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:38,080
I mean, you come in here, you don't help me,
you say the one plan I've got is bad,

500
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:43,126
you claim to be a creation of my mind, and
yet you are in no way dressed provocatively...

501
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:45,796
Look.

502
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:55,973
Well, it's always been there.

503
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:57,140
No, it hasn't.

504
00:25:57,182 --> 00:26:00,561
The impact with the ocean floor must
have created a micro-fissure in the hull.

505
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:08,151
We're taking on water.

506
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,199
<i>Atlantis...</i>

507
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:15,576
<i>this is Sheppard. Come in.</i>

508
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,911
<i>We can barely hear you, John.</i>

509
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:21,790
We're going to lose you altogether when we get deeper,
so now's a good time to wish us luck.

510
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,250
Good luck, then.

511
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,586
<i>We'll contact you as soon</i>
<i>as we head back to the surface.</i>

512
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,130
<i>Have the divers on Jumper 8 standing by.</i>

513
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,298
Will do.

514
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,174
Weir out.

515
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,180
What do you think, Radek?

516
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,057
About what?

517
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,517
We're underwater.

518
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,186
I always wanted to try this.

519
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:44,229
Yes, yes, yes. Just...

520
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:47,024
make sure we're not under too much water.

521
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:51,403
I've leveled out and holding steady at 990 feet.

522
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:52,613
How's it coming?

523
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,949
All I'm getting is sporadic life sign readings.

524
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:57,326
As in...

525
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,411
sea monster life signs?

526
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,833
We're gonna need those shields up and running.

527
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:07,461
Yes, well, then stop talking, please.

528
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:08,754
Will do.

529
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:25,395
It's funny,

530
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:26,563
because actually...

531
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:27,731
I was just, you know,

532
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:29,608
thinking, what would complete this experience?

533
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,400
Would be...

534
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:33,278
freezing cold sea water in the compartment,
lots of it,

535
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,865
and because now that the whole imploding
thing is kind of off the table,

536
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:39,409
drowning should really be
brought back into the equation.

537
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,078
You can fix this.

538
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:44,665
There are micro-fractures all along the seam.

539
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,167
You still have fully functioning life support, right?

540
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:47,918
Yes.

541
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,420
Then create a positive pressure environment.

542
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:52,047
What?

543
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:55,634
If you can increase the pressure inside the Jumper,
you should be able to slow the leaking.

544
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:57,094
We'll never be able to stop it.

545
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,555
I'm not saying that we could.
We're just trying to buy time here.

546
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:02,599
In order to make death as long
and as drawn-out as possible?

547
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:04,768
Just max it out, McKay.

548
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:06,812
Alright.

549
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:18,156
We should probably find a way
to heat this water, too.

550
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,200
We make a good team,

551
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:21,159
you and I.

552
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:24,621
Sure.

553
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:26,164
No, no, I mean it.

554
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:28,166
I really enjoy working with you.

555
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,668
Always have.

556
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,045
I wonder...

557
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:33,589
I wonder why we never...

558
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,048
hooked up.

559
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:39,386
Well, aside from the fact that you're petty,
arrogant, and treat people badly?

560
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:41,722
Yes.

561
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:45,100
No, that's pretty much it.
Petty, arrogant, bad with people.

562
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:48,520
But...

563
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:50,189
you do find me attractive...

564
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,107
I mean, physically.

565
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:56,028
Let's stick to working on my idea.

566
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,237
This is my idea.

567
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,030
How do you figure?

568
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,448
Well, you don't exist.

569
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:02,492
You think what my subconscious tells you to think,

570
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:04,870
<i>so really, the idea was mine.</i>

571
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:13,086
I'm arguing with myself about
who had an idea first, me or me.

572
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:15,422
I really am petty, aren't I?

573
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:18,759
And arrogant and bad with people, yes.

574
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:22,137
Here we go.

575
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:36,568
And the leaking...

576
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,487
has been slowed.

577
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,155
Well done, Sam.

578
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:41,990
Thanks. You too.

579
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:44,660
Come here.

580
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:46,995
Okay.

581
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:52,167
You do realize what you're actually doing here, right?

582
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:53,836
Oh, come on!

583
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:57,923
You're a figment of my imagination.
The least you could do is take your top off.

584
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:01,635
Your subconscious mind knows
that I would never be into that.

585
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:04,096
You are the worst hallucination ever.

586
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:05,347
Oh, you don't mean that.

587
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:06,849
Yes, yes, I do.

588
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,310
Now, please, just leave me alone
while I work on getting myself out of this.

589
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:13,146
You're not gonna still try and control
the Jumper from that little thing, are you?

590
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:15,190
Yes, yes, I am...

591
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:18,694
and I have to do it quickly,
before power levels drop below 50%...

592
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:19,570
so...

593
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:22,948
that leaves me about 10 minutes.

594
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:27,411
If you're not going to help,
then please stand back and keep quiet.

595
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:30,664
See, this is why I could never have
a relationship with you, Rodney.

596
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:32,708
You don't listen to people.
You don't trust them.

597
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:35,294
I have every reason not to.

598
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,921
Look, this whole thing is Zelenka's fault.

599
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:40,340
He was the one responsible
for supervising the Jumper repairs.

600
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:43,719
He was the one who said she was ready to fly.
He was the one who came to me

601
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,599
embarrassed because he was afraid to fly
at the best of times, not to mention a test flight.

602
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,103
God, I should have just told him to suck it up,
but no, no, I say, "sure, I'll take her out,"

603
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:58,692
and now he's all safe and warm and cozy on the surface,
while I'm stuck down here, paying for his mistakes.

604
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:03,739
You'll excuse me if my trust in
my fellow scientist is at an all-time low.

605
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,407
If you want something done right,

606
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:07,451
do it yourself.

607
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:09,786
Okay.

608
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:15,792
I think we may be on to something.

609
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,213
Initializing shields.

610
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:22,549
Nice work, doc.

611
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:25,344
Okay, let's take this thing a little deeper.

612
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:26,136
<i>Wait.</i>

613
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:28,555
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

614
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:31,266
I was afraid of this.

615
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:34,436
The shield is draining our power
at an alarmingly fast rate.

616
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:35,437
Why's that?

617
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:40,234
Well, a cloak draws its power at a constant rate,
whereas a shield draws more power the more it is taxed.

618
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:41,109
So...

619
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:44,363
being under several atmospheres of pressure...

620
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:45,239
<i>Yes...</i>

621
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,783
is continuously draining power from our shield.

622
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:49,660
How much time do we have?

623
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:51,745
Once we're deeper...

624
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:54,540
30 minutes, tops.

625
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,124
Alright.

626
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:59,962
Descending through 1,000.

627
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:15,060
- Why don't you turn up the heat?
- I did.

628
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:16,728
It's the sea water.

629
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:21,275
I've got barely enough power as it is.
Besides, I'm almost done here. What are you doing?

630
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:22,985
For warmth.

631
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:27,364
You, you... you're not physically here.
You can't transfer any heat.

632
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:30,701
Doesn't mean I can't get you hot.

633
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:34,830
Excuse me?

634
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:46,967
You know, I was thinking about what you said.

635
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:48,302
I think you were right.

636
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:50,679
I am?

637
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:52,472
Right about what?

638
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,016
Well, I am your fantasy.

639
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,685
It's only fair you should get some.

640
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,856
- Really?
- Really.

641
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:03,692
I knew it.

642
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,736
I knew you were hot.

643
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,326
Wait a second.

644
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:13,493
Don't ruin the moment.

645
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:15,245
No, I know what you're trying to do.

646
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:16,288
I should hope so.

647
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,414
You're trying to slow me down again.

648
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:18,957
Actually, I'm trying to do the opposite.

649
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:21,168
No... No.

650
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:23,420
You're distracting me.

651
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:29,092
You know I've only got a couple of minutes
to execute my plan. You're doing the one
thing you know could possibly slow me down.

652
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:31,011
You're thinking too much. Come here.

653
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:31,887
No.

654
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:35,516
No, I'm not going to fall for your plan,
lieutenant colonel siren.

655
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,607
This program is gonna work,

656
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:45,234
and I am gonna execute it.

657
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:47,569
Don't do it, Rodney.

658
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:49,196
It's not gonna work.

659
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,534
Look, you're cold, you're desperate, you've banged
your head. You're primed to make a mistake.

660
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:55,244
I should have ignored you from the beginning.

661
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:57,079
You've done nothing but slow me down.

662
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,206
They're coming for you. They're
gonna get you out of here.

663
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:03,460
- Please, just give them a chance.
- Not listening.

664
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:04,795
Don't.

665
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:05,921
And there.

666
00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:07,589
It's ready.

667
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:08,841
No time to argue.

668
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:10,300
It's a mistake.

669
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:14,096
I trust you'll be gone by the time I reach the surface.

670
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:34,116
Don't... speak right now.

671
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:37,244
I really don't need an I-told-you-so, so...

672
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,539
How much power did you waste?

673
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:44,084
30 minutes.

674
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:46,253
- Okay. That's not so bad.
<i>- No.</i>

675
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,130
No, I... I've got...

676
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,591
half an hour
till we're completely out of power.

677
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,343
Half an hour till I'm dead.

678
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:07,941
<i>Bloody hell! It's screwed up this.</i>
<i>Whose idea was this, we'll be under water, this time?</i>

679
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:11,653
I think my czech's getting better,
because I know what you mean.

680
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:14,239
Could be the shield, could be the depth.

681
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:16,825
I'm having trouble detecting the Jumper.

682
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:18,035
Only...

683
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:19,995
Only what?

684
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:23,624
Could you bring up the H.U.D., please?

685
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:29,004
What's that?

686
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,757
<i>Your sea monster.</i>

687
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:36,637
It's at least six to eight times
as large as this Jumper, so...

688
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:38,263
let's not venture too closely, okay?

689
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:40,432
How are the shields doing?

690
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:43,143
12 minutes.

691
00:35:43,352 --> 00:35:44,394
Alright.

692
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:46,730
Let's check it out.

693
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:48,190
Why?

694
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:53,654
Because it's still swimming around in
circles in the same area, which means...

695
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:56,114
it might have found something interesting.

696
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:11,004
What?

697
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,549
What do you want from me?

698
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:18,053
Just... just... go away.

699
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:19,847
I think he...

700
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:23,100
I think he's, he's just waiting to eat me.

701
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:27,938
I treated him pretty bad.

702
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:30,941
The whale?

703
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:34,987
No. Griffin. I changed the subject.
You of all people should be able to keep up.

704
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:36,488
Sorry.

705
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:41,785
He knew we were both going to die
if he didn't do anything, so...

706
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:42,828
He...

707
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:47,416
Why didn't I think of it first?

708
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:51,461
Maybe I did.

709
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:55,132
<i>I thought of it. I just couldn't...</i>

710
00:36:58,427 --> 00:37:00,137
He was a brave man,

711
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,430
and I...

712
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,602
It just doesn't seem right, you know?

713
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,902
It's been a bad day.

714
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:17,946
You're going to get out of this.

715
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:21,700
I don't think I'd even believe
that if you were naked.

716
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:31,335
Oh, well.

717
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:39,801
<i>Stick with me Rodney.</i>

718
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:42,846
You've got to stay alert.

719
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:46,558
My plan was stupid.

720
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,685
What the hell was I thinking?

721
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:50,938
Well, 20/20 hindsight...

722
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:55,192
You were right.

723
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:58,028
I should have listened to you.

724
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:02,824
I always admired you, Sam...

725
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:05,619
and I'm not just trying to...

726
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,621
I know.

727
00:38:09,623 --> 00:38:12,584
I honestly don't think you're smarter than I am.

728
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:14,378
<i>On your best day...</i>

729
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,712
we're, like...

730
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:17,297
maybe a tie.

731
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:20,843
There is a compliment coming, right?

732
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:22,052
Yes.

733
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,556
My intelligence aside...

734
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:27,975
you're wiser.

735
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:32,563
I guess at the end of the day,
that's why you're down here.

736
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:36,441
You were right.

737
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,818
Well...

738
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,027
you were right.

739
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:42,114
At least subconsciously.

740
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:48,871
I guess that's something.

741
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,500
Jumper.

742
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:55,085
I have the Jumper.

743
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:57,129
The animal's circling around it.

744
00:38:57,629 --> 00:38:59,464
Jumper 6, this is Sheppard.
Come in.

745
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:02,176
According to these readings, it's dead.

746
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:03,510
There's no power.

747
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:06,555
Alright, let's get a grapple on this thing and go home.

748
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:08,682
No, it won't work.

749
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:10,350
Why's that?

750
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,936
It's taken on too much water.

751
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:15,856
Sensors indicate
even the rear compartment is partially full.

752
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:18,192
The cable can't take the strain.

753
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:19,860
- Well, we can try.
- No, listen to me.

754
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:24,031
- No. It's a matter of simple physics.
- I'm not coming this far without doing something.

755
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:28,118
The shield.

756
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:31,205
We could extend the shield between the two Jumpers.

757
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,583
Do we have enough power?

758
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:37,794
Yes. If we touch down on the ocean floor
to conserve engine power,

759
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:40,380
it should be just a matter
of walking between the two Jumpers.

760
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:41,632
Alright.

761
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,134
I'll get us close.

762
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,439
What the hell was that?

763
00:39:57,689 --> 00:39:58,565
Help.

764
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:00,984
<i>McKay, Griffin...</i>
<i>do you copy?</i>

765
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:02,653
Sheppard?

766
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:03,987
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

767
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:05,239
<i>What say you lower your door?</i>

768
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,074
I think that's probably a bad idea.

769
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:09,201
<i>Listen, long story short,</i>

770
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:15,040
<i>we've converted the cloak into a shield and extended it</i>
<i>around your Jumper. I'm standing outside right now.</i>

771
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,000
What?

772
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:21,588
<i>All you have to do is open</i>
<i>your door and walk to my Jumper.</i>

773
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,674
I told you they'd come up with something.

774
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:44,027
What?

775
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:46,613
What if it's not Sheppard?

776
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:48,282
<i>What do you mean?</i>

777
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:50,158
What if it's another one of my hallucinations? What...

778
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,078
if it's the pessimist in me
who just wants it all over with?

779
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,913
You heard the shield come on.

780
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:56,373
I hear you.

781
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:59,209
<i>McKay? What's the holdup?</i>

782
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:02,671
<i>We need to do this sooner rather than later.</i>
<i>The shield ain't gonna hold forever.</i>

783
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:05,215
You're minutes away from hypothermia.

784
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:07,968
I just... I can't tell what's real and what's not.

785
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:09,344
<i>Rodney...</i>

786
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:11,054
they're here.

787
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:12,764
They did it.

788
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:15,309
Let them help you.

789
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:19,479
Okay.

790
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:21,648
O..okay.

791
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:27,321
Better stand back.
I've taken on a lot of water.

792
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:36,121
No.

793
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:39,875
Secondary release.

794
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,487
<i>Rodney, are you alright?</i>

795
00:42:09,238 --> 00:42:10,864
- I will be.
- Where's Griffin?

796
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:12,366
He was in there.

797
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:16,954
- Alright, let's get you home.
- No, I need to decompress.

798
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:18,664
Carter told me to increase the pressure.

799
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:19,289
Carter?

800
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:21,667
I did. I did. I told myself.

801
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,710
I hit my head.

802
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:32,135
<i>See, pal?</i>

803
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:33,554
Sorry you won't get to eat me today.

804
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:35,097
He's the reason we found you.

805
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:36,265
Really?

806
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:38,100
I almost thought we lost you.

807
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:40,269
I knew you'd think of something...

808
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,230
subconsciously, at least.
