1
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,730
May I join you?

2
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,575
It's called Chess.

3
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,118
It's a game.

4
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,622
They've been sitting there like that since I sat down.

5
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,083
Those two? They play every single day.

6
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,168
Neither one of them's even blinked yet.

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,004
Well, it's not really a game of action.

8
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,549
I can see that.

9
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,552
It's all about strategy.

10
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,639
He's planning his next move
and the move after that and...

11
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,057
the move after that.

12
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,018
I guess you do a lot of that around here.

13
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,104
Yes we do.

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,691
I take it that's not how you prefer to do things.

15
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:07,860
No.

16
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,152
I'm leaving.

17
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,279
<i>Hey! Ronon, wait.</i>

18
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,949
Just because we do things differently,
doesn't mean we can't learn from each other.

19
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,744
And Colonel Sheppard has already
invested an incredible amount of time

20
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,455
and energy trying to make you
an intregal part of his team.

21
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,251
I meant I'm leaving the table.

22
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,382
- Is that OK?
- Yes of course. I'm sorry.

23
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,217
- I thought that...
<i>- Dr Weir?</i>

24
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,178
Rodney, what is it?

25
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,054
<i>Something you should see here.</i>

26
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,557
I'm on my way.

27
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,062
I'm leaving too.

28
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,355
OK.

29
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,690
OK...

30
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,359
<i>What is it?</i>

31
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,155
That is the signature of an
Ancient ship called the Aurora.

32
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:57,618
With a ZPM now powering the city,
we've been reactivating dormant systems.

33
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,495
That one tracked the location of
Ancient ships during the war.

34
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,622
A warship?

35
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,708
See, look at his eyes, all lighting up again.
It's Pavlovian.

36
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,919
I crosschecked the logs.

37
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,254
They were on a reconnaissance mission.

38
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:13,842
When we activated the ZPM, the city must have sent out
some kind of automated subspace beacon,

39
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,511
recalling ships back to Atlantis.

40
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,803
How long before it gets here?

41
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:20,182
Well, given that it's at the edge
of the Pegasus Galaxy...

42
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,809
Let's see, carry the four...

43
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,396
Forty-two million years.
Shall we go wait on the porch?

44
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,150
So we take a Jumper through the
nearest Stargate and check it out.

45
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,735
Clever, but wrong.

46
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,612
There are no nearby Stargates.

47
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,405
Not within Jumper distance, no.

48
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,367
Which leaves us only one way to get there.

49
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,664
Please don't force me to remind you that I do

50
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:47,417
- have discretionary power to utilize the Daedalus..
- I'm well aware of the extent of your powers, Dr Weir.

51
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,877
and they end at the hatch of this ship!

52
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,880
- Colonel, do we have to..?
- Relax Dr, I happen to agree.

53
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:55,801
The value of an Ancient warship in our hands, instead of
the Wraith, is more than enough incentive for me.

54
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:56,635
<i>Good.</i>

55
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,387
<i>Colonel Sheppard's team is ready to go.</i>

56
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,721
No, my crew can handle this.

57
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,975
My team is far more experienced
with Ancient technology.

58
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:06,562
My people will only get that kind of experience
by going on this kind of a mission.

59
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,021
Not this mission.

60
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,900
We discovered it. We check it out.
Your crew can cut their teeth on something else.

61
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:13,110
Fine!

62
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,487
Have Colonel Sheppard's team ready to go in an hour.

63
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,073
They're ready now.

64
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,298

67
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,360
We should have visual soon.

68
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,037
Sir!

69
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,455
Detecting a second ship.

70
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,211
Move!

71
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,631
Looks like a small Wraith vessel.

72
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,465
Dart?

73
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,051
No, bigger. Some sort of a scout ship,
probably after the same thing we are.

74
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,136
It's altering course.
Coming straight at us.

75
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,514
Must have seen us drop out of hyperspace.

76
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,723
Weapons range?

77
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,808
Five seconds.

78
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,024
Target is locked!

79
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:16,900
Fire!

80
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,200
Target is destroyed.

81
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,871
All these years and just now the Wraith find this ship?

82
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,081
All these years, the Aurora lay dormant.

83
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,710
The signal from Atlantis woke it up,
making it visible to the Wraith as well as us.

84
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,505
Is that it?

85
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,062
Looks like it was in a hell of a fight.

86
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,148
And lost.

87
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,941
Life support?

88
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,651
Negative Sir.

89
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,361
Looks like you're gonna have to suit up, Colonel.

90
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,071
On our way.

91
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,875
Should be just outside the bridge.

92
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,857
You mean what used to be the bridge.

93
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,111
Colonel Sheppard?

94
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,060
Stasis pods.

95
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,271
They're still powered up.

96
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:18,939
<i>Stasis?</i>

97
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,567
We found a similar pod in Atlantis.

98
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:26,071
It keeps a person alive for many years
in a type of frozen hibernation.

99
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,115
<i>Yeah, if you call that living.</i>

100
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,284
This one's uniform is different from the others.

101
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,661
- Maybe the Captain?
- Or his Maitre D.

102
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,706
Lifesign indicators are active.

103
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,792
These capsules must have some kind of a shielding.

104
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,044
That's why the Daedalus' sensors
were unable to pick them up.

105
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,672
Look at all of them.

106
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,594
That's just on this deck.

107
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,096
Who knows how many more
there are on the rest of the ship?

108
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,934
Look, our time in these suits is limited.
Can you get life support up and running?

109
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:56,768
I'm on it.

110
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,414
They're all alive?

111
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,000
The entire crew?

112
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,376
<i>Well...</i>

113
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,671
They're in a kind of suspended animation.

114
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,342
Not entirely suspended, however.

115
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:33,263
The pod has slowed their ageing considerably,
but the bodies are virtually moribund.

116
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,142
Teyla and Ronon are searching the rest of the ship.
My guess is, there's hundreds.

117
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,561
Is there anything we can do for them?

118
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,730
Well, reviving them's out of the question.

119
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,066
Look, the pod's the only thing keeping them alive!

120
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,151
What are we gonna do with them then?

121
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,155
Wait.

122
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,698
What?

123
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,202
There's something going on!

124
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,288
This pod is magnetically shielded!

125
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,249
I'm reading cortical signals.

126
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,458
Which means?

127
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,252
The pod's equipped with a neural interface.

128
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,755
It's indicating a definite brain activity,
as though he were perfectly conscious.

129
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,886
If all of these pods are interconnected,
it's highly possible that these people, are in fact,

130
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,012
communicating with each other.

131
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,890
This has been going on for ten thousand years?

132
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,561
<i>Possibly. It's a way of keeping their</i>
<i>minds occupied until they were rescued.</i>

133
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,729
<i>One long conversation.</i>

134
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:27,192
Yeah well, more likely, the interface was reactivated
when the recall beacon from Atlantis was received.

135
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,028
Either way, the neural feedback
loop is incredibly active.

136
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,572
Any way to figure out what they're saying?

137
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,866
Yes of course, it says right here!

138
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,911
'Why is the smart one having to stop
and answer so many questions?'

139
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,997
It's a fair question, Doctor.

140
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,832
<i>Of course it is!</i>

141
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:45,502
Being able to communicate with a living
Ancient is the opportunity of a lifetime!

142
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,755
But this system is a highly complex system,
which I will have...

143
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,717
- Wait a minute!
- What?

144
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:52,968
Answering your question.

145
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,094
Teyla!

146
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:55,721
Found any more of the pods?

147
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,139
<i>Yes, many.</i>

148
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,057
<i>And there are many more decks we have yet to search.</i>

149
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,851
Are any of the pods empty?

150
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:01,894
<i>A few.</i>

151
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:03,645
Perfect.

152
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,695
You sure this is such a good idea?

153
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:12,905
What's the matter, Colonel?

154
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:14,364
Don't trust me?

155
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,991
No.

156
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:17,910
Fine!

157
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,330
<i>You're proposing actually freezing</i>
<i>yourself in one of those things?</i>

158
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:25,375
I should be able to tap into the neural network
without actually initialising stasis.

159
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,878
<i>Look, it won't take long.</i>
<i>I'll be in and out.</i>

160
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,593
The quickest way to figure out what is
going on in there is to to tap into the system

161
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,136
and communicate directly with the Captain!

162
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,848
Need I remind you of the obvious value in this?

163
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,350
But is it safe?

164
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,685
Would I be volunteering to go if it wasn't?

165
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,479
No.

166
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,524
Which is exactly what makes
it safe enough for me to go.

167
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:49,858
What?

168
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,944
Better to have you on the outside,
in case something goes wrong.

169
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,695
- It won't!
- But if it does.

170
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,531
- It won't! How many times do I have to say this?
- Rodney.

171
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,033
Between the two of you,
if something were to go wrong...

172
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,910
which would be the greater loss?

173
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,037
Well I've never thought of it that way, but...

174
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,665
she's right! You should go.

175
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:14,716
Now, remember.

176
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:19,012
The system creates a direct feedback loop
between the processor and your brainwaves, so,

177
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,265
when you wanna disconnect, you'll need to

178
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,933
well, really concentrate.

179
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,101
You mean, think it.

180
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:28,105
Well I think it'll probably take a little bit more
than that, otherwise you'd be popping in and out of
the thing, every time it crossed your mind.

181
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,858
So, there's no place like home?

182
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,484
If that works for you.

183
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,320
Now, I should be able to monitor your EEG patterns, so

184
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:40,325
in the highly unlikely event that something anomalous
should present itself, I should be able to

185
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,160
- disconnect you manually.
- Good!

186
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,580
Without permanent brain damage.

187
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,290
Rodney?

188
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:49,376
Well, the opportunity to speak to a
living Ancient is worth the risk?

189
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,755
Now, when I close the lid,
the pod system should activate. Ready?

190
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,008
I was.

191
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:57,009
Good.

192
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,654
This is weird.

193
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,044
Who are you?

194
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:33,754
Lt Colonel John Sheppard.

195
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,758
- Part of an expedition...
- This deck is restricted.

196
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,176
How did you get in here?

197
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,595
My team discovered your ship.

198
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,639
Your crew was in a stasis pod.

199
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,432
- We decided to tap in...
- Stay where you are.

200
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,226
Security to engineering deck!

201
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,479
- You don't need to call security.
- Stay where you are.

202
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,338
The hyperdrive construct
modifications are commencing Sir.

203
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,341
Make certain the equations are
entered in the correct sequence.

204
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,052
We don't wanna overload the control conduit.

205
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,095
Yes Sir.

206
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,013
Is this him?

207
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:26,014
Yes Sir.

208
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,853
You wear the uniform of my crew, but I don't know you.

209
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,480
My name's Lt Col John Sheppard.

210
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,190
We discovered your ship.

211
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,444
We found you and your crew in the stasis pods.
We decided to tap into the system,

212
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,654
in order to communicate with you.

213
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,326
System?

214
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:49,621
This!

215
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:53,333
This virtual reality.

216
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,506
You do know this is kinda, simulated?

217
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:12,603
Is there some place more private we can talk?

218
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,151
It's not exactly what I meant by private.

219
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,862
I wanna know who you are and
how you got aboard this ship.

220
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,323
I told you. My name's Col John Sheppard.

221
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,617
- Part of an expedition...
- What expedition?

222
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,994
Let me bottom line this for you.

223
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,079
We came from Atlantis.

224
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:36,126
<i>Except it's not quite the Atlantis you remember.</i>
<i>Ten thousand years have gone by since you left.</i>

225
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,922
Look, I know all this sounds strange,
but I'm telling you the truth.

226
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,134
Right now, you're all in your
stasis pods, aboard Aurora.

227
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:46,595
The ship's been derelict for centuries.
None of this is real.

228
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,430
I expected you to know that.

229
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,141
You don't have time to bother with this nonsense.

230
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,019
<i>The hyperdrive modifications</i>
<i>are much more pressing, Sir.</i>

231
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,272
What kind of hyperdrive modifications?

232
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:02,361
We're attempting to modify our propulsion,
in order to return to Atlantis as quickly as possible.

233
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,905
Then we'll see if you're speaking the truth.

234
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:09,117
Oh, look.
The Atlantis you know doesn't exist anymore.

235
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,162
During the war with the Wraith,
the city was evacuated back to Earth.

236
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:15,040
- Evacuated? Why would we do that?
<i>- Sir.</i>

237
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,253
- The war was lost.
- Nothing is lost.

238
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,546
Not yet!

239
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:26,718
I have vital information concerning
a weakness in Wraith technology and when
I deliver the communiqué in my possession,

240
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,013
- the tide will most certainly turn in our favour.
- That's right.

241
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,391
The Atlantis mission log
said you were on a recon mission.

242
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:36,103
What, what, what kind of weakness
are we talking about?

243
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:40,065
- That information is reserved for the council.
- There is no council anymore!

244
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,776
- Sir, we must return to the bridge.
- Wai.. wait!

245
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,653
According to the logs,

246
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:50,534
the Aurora left Lantian space during the Siege.
That means the city had already been sunk
to the bottom of the ocean.

247
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,580
You're wondering, how could I know that?

248
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,372
Yes.

249
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:57,583
Because that's where it was when we found it!

250
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:02,212
We're wasting time, Sir.
You need to attend to the hyperdrive.

251
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,506
<i>Wait!</i>

252
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:10,012
The information in that communiqué,
could still be incredibly valuable to us!

253
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,456
So?

254
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,042
- It worked.
- Well of course it worked!

255
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,837
Ah, for a minute, I thought
I was gonna get stuck there.

256
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:44,838
Where's Teyla and Ronon?

257
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,965
Well, Caldwell sent them to search
the ship's armoury.

258
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,343
- Yeah?
- No. Unfortunately it was depleted of drones.

259
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,595
Look, so, what happened?
Were you able to communicate with the Captain?

260
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:56,308
Face to face, pretty impressive in there and
they have a whole virtual reality thing going on.

261
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,977
- Actually, the correct term is virtual environment.
- Yeah, whatever.

262
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,523
- So, what did you find out?
- For starters, I have to go back.

263
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,067
<i>What do you mean you have to go back?</i>

264
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,152
<i>The Aurora was on a recon mission.</i>

265
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:13,116
<i>The Captain was carrying a communiqué</i>
<i>back to Atlantis. In it, is vital information</i>
<i>about a weakness in Wraith technology.</i>

266
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,243
What kind of weakness?

267
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,328
Well, that's why I have to go back.
He didn't tell me.

268
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,082
He's trying to modify the hyperdrives,
in order to get back to Atlantis faster, to deliver it.

269
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,377
Well, did you mention that that's impossible,
given that they're living in a virtual environment?

270
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,420
No, Rodney, that slipped my mind.

271
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,505
Well, I would have thought that
would have been the first thing...

272
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,382
Of course I mentioned it!

273
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:34,638
They don't remember putting themselves
in stasis. Consequently,
they had no idea who I was or how I got there.

274
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,848
Well why would the pods do that?

275
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:39,977
That's a good question and another reason I
should go back. What do you think, Colonel?

276
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:41,979
Go!

277
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:51,822
Hello!

278
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,283
Anybody there?

279
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:57,786
<i>Hi.</i>

280
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:00,664
I really need to talk to the Captain.

281
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,165
Why?

282
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,378
Tell him I'm ready to make a full confession.

283
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,057
Dr McKay?

284
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:19,725
<i>Go ahead.</i>

285
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,519
Long range sensors have just detected
two Wraith Cruisers heading this way.

286
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:25,480
No doubt coming to investigate why
their scout ship was destroyed earlier.

287
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,565
<i>What's their ETA?</i>

288
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,943
A little over an hour and I plan on being
long gone by then. What's the status there?

289
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,070
I've been able to decipher
some more of the program.

290
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:36,116
I'm actually reading neural tracking signatures of the
entire crew as they make their way through the...

291
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,076
I meant Colonel Sheppard's status?

292
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,536
Oh him!

293
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,788
Yeah well, he's, he's still in the pod.

294
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:46,335
<i>Understood. Just be aware of the time constraints</i>
<i>with the Wraith ships approaching.</i>
<i>We can't risk being discovered.</i>

295
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,253
Yes... Ticking clock.
Anything else?

296
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,339
If he's not out of there in thirty minutes,

297
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,299
disconnect him manually.

298
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:54,468
Right.

299
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:07,481
- Where's the Captain?
- He's got more pressing
concerns at the moment. He sent me in his stead.

300
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,109
I was told you were ready to make a full confession?

301
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,152
Yeah,

302
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,111
well,

303
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,154
no.

304
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:15,906
Actually,

305
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:20,661
I just wanted to talk to him to
try to convince him that we're on the same side.

306
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:24,873
Perhaps you would have more success if
your story were not so preposterous.

307
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:27,125
It's not preposterous.

308
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,419
- You say you're from Atlantis.
- Yes.

309
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:32,548
And yet you also say that Atlantis has been evacuated.

310
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,549
Yes.

311
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:34,842
Well,

312
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,134
it was.

313
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,262
10,000 years ago.

314
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:42,349
- Look, we just discovered it last year.
- You discovered it.

315
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:43,433
We came from Earth.

316
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:47,563
We found the city deserted. We set a base.
Been living there ever since. That's how we found you.

317
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,732
We saw the Aurora
on one of the city's long range sensors.

318
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:54,027
Even after all these years,
the Wraith are still causing a lot of problems.

319
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,572
We managed to hold them off for now, but

320
00:19:56,613 --> 00:20:00,325
we could sure use that information
about the weakness in their technology.

321
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,912
- Only the Captain has access to the communiqué.
- Well then, let me talk to him.

322
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,164
I can deliver the message myself.

323
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:09,334
The quicker it gets back to Atlantis,
the better for all of us.

324
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:13,213
- You seem sincere.
- Yes, I am.

325
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:15,883
Very sincere.

326
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:17,885
<i>I would be</i>

327
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:18,760
<i>very,</i>

328
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:19,803
very

329
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,138
grateful.

330
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:27,436
I'll speak to him for you.

331
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:46,163
More of the same!

332
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:50,626
I am counting.
I do not want to lose my place.

333
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,753
I counted 376.

334
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:56,131
No wait! 398. I forgot about the
infirmary.

335
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:59,384
There's 22 in there. Or is it 23?

336
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:00,677
Sorry.

337
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,563
Where did she come from?

338
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,662
Oh no.

339
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,331
<i>Dr McKay?</i>

340
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:30,457
Still here.

341
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:33,752
<i> There's something you need to see.</i>
<i>We are two decks directly below you.</i>

342
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,128
Can't it wait?

343
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,171
<i> No!</i>

344
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:45,848
Guard!

345
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:54,815
- I need to talk to the First Officer.
- She gave orders not to be disturbed.

346
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:58,318
It's okay! She said she was going to talk
to the Captain for me. It's been a while, so....

347
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,280
She also gave orders
to ignore everything you say.

348
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,201
Then why are you talking to me right now?

349
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,000
I need to see the Captain!

350
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,639
Alright. That should be enough time.

351
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,360
Give me this thing.

352
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:47,409
I really don't like being ignored.

353
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:55,584
- What is it?
- Have a look.

354
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:02,966
This is Wraith gear...

355
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,636
and it's recently installed.

356
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,971
There's a reason for that.

357
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,151
<i>Are there any more?</i>

358
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:24,112
Well it's hard to say, since you plucked us
out of there the second you heard.

359
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:27,282
Ronon and I have searched the ship.
I am certain there is only one.

360
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:31,078
The Wraith tied into the same neural
feedback loop as the crew and Colonel Sheppard.

361
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,412
And by the looks of it,

362
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:35,541
they must have found Aurora a long time ago.
Certainly long enough to figure out

363
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,709
how to access and reconfigure the system.

364
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:40,170
<i> Given their apparent psychic abilities,</i>

365
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:43,382
is it possible the Wraith ships on the way are
in communication with the Wraith aboard the Aurora?

366
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,925
No. They need to be closer.

367
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:48,387
She's right. We've already determined that
the range of the Wraith psychic ability is limited.

368
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,764
So we can't risk those ships getting within that range.

369
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:52,891
- I say we go back and kill it, right now.
- I agree.

370
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:54,601
Stop!

371
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,770
Let's not get all trigger happy.

372
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:59,857
We have no idea how much of
the system this Wraith is manipulating!

373
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:02,693
We need to figure out what is going on,
before we start shooting things!

374
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,654
- For all we know, that could kill Sheppard.
- What's he still doing there?

375
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:08,282
He can come out any time he wants.
There must be a good reason.

376
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:11,451
Knowing Sheppard, he wouldn't leave without
getting that information from the Communiqué.

377
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,828
I still don't like it.

378
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,539
The Wraith cannot physically harm him in there, can it?

379
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:16,790
No...

380
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,835
I don't think so.

381
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:23,630
I don't know, but what I do know is, I should get back
in there and learn what this Wraith is doing.

382
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,924
You've got fifteen minutes to figure it out, Doctor.

383
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,050
Fifteen?

384
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,887
Where do you people come up
with these arbitrary numbers?

385
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,639
That's the time
you've got to learn what you need to, Doctor.

386
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:33,182
Why?

387
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:36,935
Because I intend to destroy the Aurora
before those Wraith ships get here.

388
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:40,105
OK.

389
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,123
Hi. Me again.

390
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,792
Wait, wait, please. Just listen.

391
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:04,880
I'm not here to hurt anyone.

392
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:06,590
I wanna help you.

393
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:08,217
Help all of us.

394
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:13,597
I know all this sounds strange, but
just give me a chance to prove that what I am saying...

395
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,851
- Are you alright, Sir?
- Yes, I'm fine.

396
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,770
Take him back to the brig.

397
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:29,988
He escaped only moments ago.
I'll see to it he doesn't disturb you again.

398
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:32,783
What if he is telling the truth?

399
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,873
Do you not sense it, too,

400
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,543
that something is wrong?

401
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:45,379
You're exhausted Sir.

402
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,047
True.

403
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,509
I am in need of rest.

404
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,223
Even more so, than my crew.

405
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,477
<i> Rest is a luxury we cannot afford, Sir.</i>

406
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:04,314
The Aurora is a fine ship,
but she was never built for speed.

407
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:08,068
Without the drive modifications,
it'll take months to return to Atlantis.

408
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,115
If we are to use this new intelligence to our advantage,
we need to reach the city within days.

409
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:16,952
Then there'll be time for rest.

410
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:18,245
<i> Yes Sir.</i>

411
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:31,884
What is wrong?

412
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,553
- Delta waves?
- What are they?

413
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,889
<i> Dr McKay. Are you ready to be beam aboard?</i>

414
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,266
It hasn't even been five minutes!

415
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,393
Dr McKay has discovered a problem.

416
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:42,561
What kind of a problem?

417
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:44,813
<i>Colonel Sheppard's EEG frequencies are decreasing.</i>

418
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:48,650
I'm reading delta waves, which indicate that
he's unconscious within the virtual environment.

419
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:51,195
I'm not sure how it happened,
but something is definitely wrong in there.

420
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:52,654
Even more reason to pull him out.

421
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:54,573
<i> That would be a mistake!</i>

422
00:26:54,615 --> 00:27:01,038
Look, additional data I've been able
to decipher from the Wraith's biometric receiver,
shows significant manipulation of the feedback loop.

423
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,332
<i>Something we were clearly not</i>
<i>aware of when Sheppard went in.</i>

424
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:06,251
We were also clearly not
aware that two Wraith Cruisers approaching.

425
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:10,464
Colonel! This Wraith is controlling the program,
which means it might have booby-trapped it as well.

426
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:12,132
We're talking about Sheppard's life here!

427
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:14,676
And I'm talking about the lives of
not only every person aboard this ship,

428
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:18,138
but every person in Atlantis,
when the Wraith find out it wasn't destroyed.

429
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,641
<i>I'm well aware of what's at stake here, Doctor.</i>

430
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,059
<i>Get him out of that pod,</i>

431
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,352
<i>or my men will.</i>

432
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,853
<i>Caldwell out.</i>

433
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:30,275
I'm going in.

434
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:33,612
Look, stall Caldwell. Buy me some time.
Just a few minutes at the most.

435
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:35,322
What if you are unable to disconnect?

436
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:37,574
Caldwell's gonna blow that ship,
whether you're in there or not.

437
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:38,742
You see, the thing is,

438
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:43,121
Colonel Sheppard and I have sort of gotten into
this habit of saving each others lives, and it's my turn.

439
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:47,876
It could be your turn next. Look,

440
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:51,672
hit this to manually disconnnect me.

441
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:54,883
If I do not regain consciousness,
go ahead and open Colonel Sheppard's pod.

442
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:58,428
Have us beamed directly to Daedalus and
make sure they have a medical team waiting.

443
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:02,850
<i> Are you sure you wanna do this?</i>

444
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,685
I'm sure I don't.

445
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,020
<i>OK.</i>

446
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,649
Alright.

447
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:12,484
There's more than enough air in there.

448
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:16,655
Alright. Course there is. The crew's been
sealed inside these things for thousands of years.

449
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:20,075
- Are you alright?
<i>- Yeah. It's just my claustrophobia. I'll be fine.</i>

450
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:21,410
I hope.

451
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,452
Now,

452
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,913
the system should engage, once you send me in.

453
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:26,415
- Alright.
<i>- Right.</i>

454
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:33,005
- So, send me in?
- Oh yes!

455
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,424
- Good luck.
- Right.

456
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:50,647
<i> Where are you taking me?</i>
<i>I have told you, I am with Colonel Sheppard!</i>

457
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,025
<i>I'm a member of his team.</i>
<i>Colonel John Sheppard? He's about,</i>

458
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:58,030
he's about so high. He has brown hair,
a bit mushed. The term is rakish?

459
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,031
Ah for...

460
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:00,908
McKay!

461
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,367
What are you doing in there?

462
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:04,453
I was about to ask you the same thing.

463
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:05,704
I, I came to help you.

464
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:07,372
I feel better already.

465
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:25,307
10,000 years aboard one of these things?

466
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:27,184
Kept alive only by life support?

467
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:28,852
I couldn't live that way.

468
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:30,938
Neither could I.

469
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,397
<i>Dr McKay, what's your status?</i>

470
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:37,611
Dr McKay is not here.

471
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:38,445
What?

472
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:39,655
He had to...

473
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:42,199
He had to check something on the Wraith pod.

474
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:43,867
Yes. The Wraith pod.

475
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:50,374
He had to check the biometrics receiver, needed to
reconfirm the frequencies of the neural feedback loop.

476
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:51,792
<i>Why isn't he on his radio?</i>

477
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:56,588
Well actually, we have been having
trouble reaching him ourselves.

478
00:29:56,797 --> 00:30:00,759
I think it might have something to do
with interference from the...

479
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:05,347
magnetic shielding of the pods.

480
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:06,515
Yes, shielding.

481
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:10,018
Ronon was just about to go and check on him.
See what is taking him so long.

482
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,437
<i>Alright, go get him. Light a fire under him.</i>

483
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:14,898
Right away.

484
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,277
<i>I want a status report as soon as</i>
<i>his radio's working. Caldwell out.</i>

485
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:20,153
Nice stalling!

486
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,658
Have you been unable to disconnect
yourself from the system?

487
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,286
No. I'm still trying to get
the information on that communiqué.

488
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,955
Oh good. We thought maybe it was
preventing your from exiting the program.

489
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:30,622
It?

490
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:34,334
We found a Wraith in one of the stasis pods.

491
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:36,211
It's manipulating the neural feedback program.

492
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:38,922
- Your EEG patterns were irregular...
- You're not kidding. I got stun.

493
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:41,216
I didn't wanna risk pulling you out till I knew more.

494
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:42,467
First Officer.

495
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:43,719
What about him?

496
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,511
Her!

497
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:46,138
She's a Wraith, she has to be.

498
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,267
There's something odd about her and she keeps
preventing me from talking to the Captain.

499
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:51,852
The Wraith we found was male.

500
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,438
The First Officer must have been female.
It took her place.

501
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,691
She knows I want that information and
the Captain's the only one with access to it.

502
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:58,734
No, we don't need the Captain.

503
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:01,612
I've been able to decipher enough of
the program to override the protocols.

504
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:04,364
All I have to do is get to a terminal
within the virtual environment

505
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:06,867
and I should be able to access any file
stored within the database.

506
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:08,327
So we just need to break out of here.

507
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:09,578
Hold that thought.

508
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:18,962
What's happening?

509
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:20,088
Give me the tablet.

510
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,423
The data device right here! Right here.

511
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:22,299
Thank you.

512
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:23,967
That's it.

513
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,015
Just keep stalling. Keep stalling.

514
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:55,040
- Hi!
- Hi.

515
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:56,083
Nice.

516
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:04,842
It should be the next hallway.

517
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,852
That's her.

518
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:16,728
- That's the Wraith?
- Yeah.

519
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:20,691
She's hot!

520
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,068
I mean, seriously hot!

521
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,279
Rodney, you're drooling over a Wraith.

522
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,407
I know. I disgust myself sometimes.

523
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:53,599
Where are Dr McKay and Colonel Sheppard?

524
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,600
Why'd you beam us back?

525
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:57,186
Because I was about to fire
a missile into the side of that ship.

526
00:32:58,228 --> 00:32:59,688
They're in the pods.

527
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:06,153
They're both in pods, now?

528
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:07,738
Yes.

529
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:10,282
Dr McKay went in to see if the Wraith was

530
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:13,243
preventing Colonel Sheppard
from disengaging from the system.

531
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:15,537
I want a team assembled,

532
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:18,874
ready to beam aboard the Aurora to disconnect
Dr McKay and Colonel Sheppard.

533
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:19,708
No, wait!

534
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:23,045
Please. Just a few more minutes.

535
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:24,963
ETA on the Wraith ships?

536
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:26,006
Eleven minutes out.

537
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:27,716
<i>I am certain he will be out by then.</i>

538
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:31,386
And if he is successful, he will know
if it is safe to disconnect Colonel Sheppard.

539
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:33,222
And if he's not out by then?

540
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:34,932
Then we'll disconnect them both.

541
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:40,437
It would be wise to have a medical team
standing by for both of them.

542
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,028
Alert the infirmary.
I want a medical team standing by.

543
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:54,326
The communiqué's been erased.

544
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:56,828
Why would the Wraith do that?

545
00:33:57,454 --> 00:34:01,834
All it say's right here. I, the Wraith, delete
this important information to keep you from seeing it.

546
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:04,545
Obviously he did it to keep us from seeing it,

547
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:06,046
but why didn't it end the damn program?

548
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:07,464
What's the point of continuing?

549
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:09,550
Oh no!

550
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,009
What?

551
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:15,055
You said they were trying to modify the hyperdrive.

552
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:17,015
So they can get back to Atlantis faster.

553
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:21,228
Well, according to the Atlantis database,
there are two different types of Ancient hyperdrives.

554
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,231
There's the more basic interstellar kind,
like the one the Aurora has

555
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:26,984
and then there's the more powerful intergalactic kind.

556
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:29,945
Similar to the one the Asgard
provided us for the Daedalus.

557
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:32,322
Why would the Wraith wanna soup up
the Aurora's hyperdrive?

558
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:35,826
Because the Wraith hyperdrives are nowhere near
as advanced as the Ancient hyperdrives.

559
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:38,579
God, with all the technology the Captain
is feeding her right now...

560
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,291
She'll learn how to modify the Wraith hyperdrives
from interstellar to intergalactic.

561
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,751
Which means they'll make it as far as Earth.

562
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,253
That's what this whole thing is about.

563
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:47,754
Their new feeding ground.

564
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:49,381
And this is just step one.

565
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:55,762
Even if she doesn't have all the information she needs,
we need to stop her from sending what she's learned
so far, to the Wraith ships that are on the way.

566
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,974
There are Wraith ships on the way?

567
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:01,059
I'm, I'm sure I mentioned that.

568
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:02,519
No you didn't.

569
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:06,481
Well it, it, it, it threw me when she was so hot.

570
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:07,941
How many ships?

571
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:09,610
It's two Cruisers.

572
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:12,946
Can you disconnect her?

573
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:13,989
Him.

574
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,700
Not from the inside, no.

575
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:19,411
I should be able to disable
the pod interface from the outside.

576
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:20,245
Then why didn't you?

577
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,664
Because I didn't know what that would do to you.

578
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:25,626
Well that's very thoughtful of you,
but now she knows all about Atlantis.

579
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:26,502
You told her?

580
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:28,170
Why?

581
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:33,592
Because I was trying to convince them that...

582
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:37,346
Just go and unplug the Wraith,
while I talk to the Captain.

583
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:38,722
The communiqué is blank!

584
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:40,849
Yeah, but he might still have some intel
about the Wraith weakness.

585
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:44,019
Now Rodney,
is there anything else you'd like to tell me?

586
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:49,233
Only that Caldwell is probably going to
destroy this ship at any moment.

587
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:51,944
Go!

588
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:52,986
Going!

589
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:06,750
Teyla! Ronon?

590
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:10,879
Oh, I don't believe it.
Two minutes in the pod, I'm abandoned.

591
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:13,632
Come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

592
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:15,926
Right.

593
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:18,262
OK.

594
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:35,529
Come on, McKay!

595
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:38,824
Hyperdrive modification commands
have been successfully entered.

596
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:40,742
Auxillary power is now online.

597
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:43,245
Very good. Prepare to engage drive.

598
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:44,079
Stop!

599
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:47,374
Your First Officer's a Wraith. She's using you.

600
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:48,667
Security to the bridge.

601
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:53,046
She gained access to the virtual environment,
by killing your First Officer and taking her place.

602
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:56,508
She's getting you to modify your hyperdrives,
so she can upgrade the Wraith hyperdrives.

603
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,634
Don't listen to him.

604
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:01,805
They need to modify their hyperdrives to make it to
my planet, Earth and I'd prefer she not do that.

605
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:02,639
This is nonsense.

606
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:03,849
I'm telling you she's Wraith.

607
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:05,893
Officer Trevell has served with me for many years.

608
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:09,104
- I can't possibly believe that she...
- Sir, with your permission I'd like to...

609
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:18,906
Come on! Disable!

610
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:39,343
I hope that was proof enough.

611
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,267
Oh no!

612
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:21,468
Come on, come on!

613
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:32,104
All this time, I thought we had evaded the enemy.

614
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:34,189
Instead, I've been unwittingly assisting them.

615
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:38,277
No Sir, she didn't succeed and if you tell me
the information in the communiqué,

616
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:40,863
we may be able to defeat the Wraith once and for all.

617
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:43,991
The information is in the ships computer.
I can give you my access codes.

618
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:46,451
We checked, it's all been erased.
Can't you tell me yourself?

619
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:49,580
No. I'm afraid I was never made aware
of it's contents, Colonel Sheppard.

620
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:53,166
The Council feared the possibility
of our capture was too great.

621
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:56,086
The information in that communiqué is gone.

622
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,091
10,000 years.

623
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:05,053
Even in stasis, our physical bodies must be...

624
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:07,139
Very old. Too old.

625
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,439
My crew deserves to know.

626
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,273
Yes they do.

627
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:21,111
And I'd love to give you all the time
in the world for that, but right now,
there are two Wraith ships on the way.

628
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:25,073
We long for nothing more than returning to Atlantis.

629
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:29,036
To raise a toast to home and victory.

630
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:33,332
We may not return home, but we will do

631
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:36,752
whatever we can to ensure that victory.

632
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,629
For that I will need your help.

633
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:45,093
<i>Well it's about damned time!</i>
<i>What'd you do, play a round of golf?</i>

634
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:46,553
We've got serious problems!

635
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:48,639
What happened?
Get down!

636
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:54,061
That happened!

637
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:56,980
Not so hot now.

638
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:00,317
My ships are coming.

639
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:03,028
They will retrieve what I have learned.

640
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,782
Earth will soon be ours.

641
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:08,659
Not if I can help it.

642
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:17,417
<i>Colonel Sheppard, we're reading two lifesigns.</i>
<i>I hope that means what I think it means.</i>

643
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:18,669
Give me one more minute.

644
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,380
We're out of time, Sheppard.
The Wraith ships are almost here.

645
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:23,882
<i>One damned minute and I can take care of that problem.</i>

646
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:28,887
Wraith Cruisers just dropped out of hyperspace, Sir.

647
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:30,222
They're aware of us.

648
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:32,015
Battle stations!

649
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:33,642
Looks like we're gonna have to fight these guys.

650
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:35,769
Bring main rail guns online.

651
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:38,021
Daedalus, this is Sheppard. We're ready.

652
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:39,523
Beam them directly onto the bridge.

653
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:47,030
Targets are in range.

654
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:48,282
Sir, we need to get outta here.

655
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:50,325
No, we need to eliminate those cruisers.
The information...

656
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:51,827
No, no, we need to get far away.

657
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:52,369
What?

658
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:54,121
The Captain gave me Aurora's self destruct code.

659
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:57,666
He assures me that it'll take care of
the Wraith ships too, but we have to get clear.

660
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,751
Bring sublight engines to military thrust.

661
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:00,794
Military thrust.

662
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:12,264
I have never been more proud than I am at this moment.

663
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:16,643
It has been an honour serving with you.

664
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:20,189
And although we may not return to Atlantis,

665
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:25,194
rest assured that the Aurora will be remembered.

666
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:53,305
We monitored all transmissions from
the Wraith Cruisers prior to the explosion.

667
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:57,935
They never got a chance to board the Aurora
or upload any of the Ancient information.

668
00:41:57,976 --> 00:41:59,728
Both Cruisers were destroyed in the explosion.

669
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,897
It's too bad you weren't able to
figure out the Wraith weakness.

670
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:03,982
At least we found out they had one.

671
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:07,486
Good work. Thank you, everyone.

672
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:11,073
Before we break up the party,
there's something I'd like to do.

673
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:15,452
It might seem a little strange,
but I promised to do something when we got home.

674
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:42,354
To the crew of the Aurora.
