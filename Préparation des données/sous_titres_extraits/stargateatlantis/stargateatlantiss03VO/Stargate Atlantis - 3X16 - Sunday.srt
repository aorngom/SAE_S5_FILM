0
00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:04,324
l could never just say that to him.

1
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:07,519
- Why not ? You like him, don’t you ?
- That is not the point.

2
00:00:07,687 --> 00:00:09,723
l think that’s exactly the point,
actually.

3
00:00:09,887 --> 00:00:12,606
The ways of my people are different.

4
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:14,997
- l’d never--
- He’s not gonna make the first move.

5
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:16,282
We shall see.

6
00:00:16,447 --> 00:00:18,642
Look, you know him better than l do--

7
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:20,286
l would hope so.

8
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:24,076
- -but l wouldn’t be surprised
if he was oblivious to the situation.

9
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:26,841
- It bears no further discussion.
- All right.

10
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:28,838
If you want someone to drop hints--

11
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:31,885
You remember the last time
so many people had the day off ?

12
00:00:32,047 --> 00:00:33,719
Yeah, it’s all Heightmeyer’s doing.

13
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:37,675
She insisted that the brass order
some sort of mandatory rest day.

14
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:40,600
l guess down time here
doesn’t really happen organically.

15
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:43,839
Hey, and don’t think l haven’t realized
you’ve changed the subject.

16
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:46,123
My people have a day of rest
every four nights.

17
00:00:46,287 --> 00:00:48,403
- Now that is civilized.
- Yes.

18
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:51,639
- Hey, wanna grab a late lunch ?
- l would like that.

19
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:53,878
l forgot my bantos rods at the gym.

20
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:56,038
- Can l meet you there ?
- Sure.

21
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:41,203
- Hi.
- Hi.

22
00:02:41,407 --> 00:02:44,365
- What are you doing here ?
- l work here.

23
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:46,879
But it’s our day off.

24
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:51,566
- Shouldn’t you be enjoying it, then ?
- l got behind on my research this week.

25
00:02:51,727 --> 00:02:55,083
Just wanted to drop off some results
for the next Earth transmission.

26
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:57,319
Great.

27
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,046
Good.

28
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:02,280
l was thinking about grabbing
some food. Care to join ?

29
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,965
- l can’t, l’ve--
- You’re not capable of having lunch ?

30
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:08,886
- Yes, l’m capable.
- Are you planning on eating today ?

31
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:10,918
- Of course.
- Great.

32
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:12,845
Eat with me.

33
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:15,316
Look, it’s nothing personal but...

34
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:20,481
l make a point of not having relationships
with people who work for me.

35
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:22,924
l don’t work for you.

36
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:25,645
l’m your boss.

37
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:28,765
Well, you’re my boss’boss, actually.

38
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:31,037
Still, however indirectly...

39
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:34,557
Yeah, but with that thinking,
everyone on this planet works for you.

40
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:38,879
- You won’t be friends with any of them ?
- Friends is one thing.

41
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:40,202
Oh, you think--

42
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:42,238
Oh, wait.
l see what’s happening here.

43
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:44,199
You think l’m asking you out
on a date.

44
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:48,440
No, no, no. This isn’t a date.
This is lunch.

45
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:51,644
This is the mandatory refueling
of our bodies.

46
00:03:51,807 --> 00:03:54,879
This is putting food in your mouth,
chewing it, having something...

47
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:58,562
... more engaging than a wall
sitting across from you. That’s all it is.

48
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:02,037
Come on. You gotta admit :
l’m more appealing than a wall, no ?

49
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:08,086
No, you don’t have to admit it
but it’d be a massive blow to my ego...

50
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,238
... if you thought otherwise.

51
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:14,044
You are more appealing than a wall.

52
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:16,317
Great. Now, what say we go grab
some grub ?

53
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:19,206
- l still have an hour of work to do--
- An hour, then.

54
00:04:19,407 --> 00:04:21,238
l’Il see you in the mess hall.

55
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,997
Élizabeth, you’re early.
Just give me a moment.

56
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:34,759
How set on lunch were you today ?

57
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:36,836
Why ?

58
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:38,446
Well, something’s come up.

59
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:41,798
Surely whatever work it is
you feel you must get done can wait.

60
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:44,083
l was invited to lunch
by Mike Branton.

61
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:45,996
Oh, really ?

62
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,916
- You and l, we had plans--
- My friend, Dr. Hewston radioed me.

63
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:53,523
She wants me to teach her
some bantos fighting this afternoon...

64
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:54,961
... so do not worry.

65
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:57,721
l will have something to occupy
my time.

66
00:04:58,287 --> 00:05:00,005
Okay.

67
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:03,444
- Are you sure ?
- Yes.

68
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:05,280
Okay.

69
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:12,886
Hello.

70
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:15,880
Oh, don’t you look lovely.

71
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:17,162
Thank you, Carson.

72
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:20,683
It’s the first time l’ve seen you
out of your uniform in quite some time.

73
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:22,565
No, l don’t know about that.

74
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:25,400
- Off somewhere special ?
- No, just getting some lunch.

75
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:27,842
Rodney and l are going fishing
on the mainland.

76
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:30,157
l know, l cleared the use
for the Jumper.

77
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:33,046
Care to join us ? Who knows
what kind of fish we’Il find ?

78
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,959
That’s very kind but some other time.

79
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,640
What ? Do you have a hot date ?

80
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:39,599
What ? Who told you that ?

81
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,957
No one. l was joking. l was right.
Who is it ?

82
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:46,478
None of my business.

83
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:48,882
- Have a lovely afternoon, Élizabeth.
- Thank you.

84
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:51,277
- You smell good too.
- Shut up.

85
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:53,039
- You believe that ?
- Yes.

86
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:56,483
- Truly and in your heart ?
- l do.

87
00:05:57,247 --> 00:05:58,236
What ?

88
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,523
l don’t know
that l can ever respect you again.

89
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,876
Come on.

90
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:05,403
You think <i>When Harry met Sally</i> is better
than <i>Annie Hall ?</i> You’re crazy.

91
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:07,165
It is.

92
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:11,726
<i>When Harry met Sally</i>
is essentially a remake...

93
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:14,805
... a cheap imitation,
a bad cover-song version of <i>Annie Hall</i>.

94
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:17,083
- You realize that, right ?
- l disagree.

95
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:19,926
l know you do,
but that’s what makes you crazy.

96
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:21,765
l guess this will never work out.

97
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:25,042
- This ?
- Lunch.

98
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:29,676
Now...

99
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:33,962
... does that mean that you don’t believe
that men and women can be friends ?

100
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:36,522
- l never said that.
- You didn’t have to say it.

101
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,599
Any lady that likes <i>When Harry met Sally</i>
thinks men and women...

102
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:42,804
- ... can’t be friends.
- Fine. Maybe l do.

103
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,721
So where does that leave me ?

104
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:48,157
l guess that leaves you at lunch.

105
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:54,038
- Come on.
- Where ?

106
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:59,165
If lunch is all l get, l’m going to get
as much bang for my buck as possible.

107
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,164
- It really is beautiful here, isn’t it ?
- Yeah.

108
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:12,919
All done ?

109
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:15,919
All done.

110
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:19,047
l guess lunch is over.

111
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:20,960
l guess it is.

112
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:22,526
l should have brought dessert.

113
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:24,723
It would have lasted longer.

114
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:28,365
l should really get back anyway.

115
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:30,597
What are you doing tomorrow ?

116
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:32,126
- Mike--
- No, l like you...

117
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,806
... and l’m extremely charming.

118
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:37,002
l’d like to see you spin those
into negatives.

119
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,596
- l don’t think--
- Probably best you don’t think.

120
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:42,037
Would you stop interrupting me ?

121
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:44,363
- You have a tendency to do that.
- l do not.

122
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:47,200
Yes, you do.
l hate it when people interrupt me.

123
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:51,406
Well, if l hadn’t interrupted you
we would never have had lunch.

124
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:54,916
Life needs a little interrupting
every now and again.

125
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:57,884
All right, l don’t completely disagree.

126
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:10,285
Was that way out of line ?

127
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:17,155
l can’t do this.

128
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:21,322
- Just because we work together ?
- This would split my focus.

129
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:23,677
- Give it a chance, see if it--
- l’m sorry. l--

130
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:27,080
l shouldn’t have done this
in the first place. l thought l--

131
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:30,956
<i>Dr. Weir, please report</i>
<i>to the control room immediately.</i>

132
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:36,036
What’s going on ?

133
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:38,516
An explosion at the base of the tower
near the gym.

134
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:42,202
Early reports have at least three dead
and a dozen or so severely injured.

135
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:44,437
Explosion ?
Was there an equipment malfunction ?

136
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,360
We’re going over the data logs
but it wasn’t a malfunction.

137
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:49,878
So it could have been a bomb ?

138
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:58,040
Oh, hey, there you are.
Been looking all over for you.

139
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:00,401
What, you forget ?

140
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:03,403
- No.
- You forgot.

141
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:07,725
You were going to teach Ronon
and myself how to play golf.

142
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,116
That’s the plan.

143
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,517
l’m afraid l have made other plans.

144
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,646
- What other plans ?
- Having lunch with Élizabeth.

145
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,275
Well, you still got time.

146
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:18,998
Yes, true.

147
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:22,000
However, l’m afraid l have been
quite delinquent...

148
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,680
... in filing my mission reports.

149
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,806
l had hoped to get caught up
before l met with Élizabeth.

150
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,878
- Okay.
- If you would like, l could cancel--

151
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:30,321
No. No. No.

152
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,365
She could use a little time
out of the office. Some other time.

153
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:35,719
Some other time.

154
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,884
You know, John,
l got mission reports too.

155
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:46,686
Nice try. It’s gonna be fun.

156
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,555
Fun ?

157
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:54,561
Nice shot.

158
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:58,766
Thank you, Jim.
It was pretty nice, though, huh ?

159
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:04,644
So that’s the sport ? You just hit
a little ball as far as you can ?

160
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:09,005
First, it’s a game, and, no,
it’s a little more complicated than that.

161
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:15,676
See, there are 18 holes, all made up
of varying lengths and dimensions.

162
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:19,277
First goal is to hit the ball
through water and sand hazards...

163
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:22,644
... till you land on the green.
Then you putt the ball into the hole.

164
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:24,846
So this is a water hazard ?

165
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:29,041
Well, we don’t have a course yet.
All we have is a driving range...

166
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,124
- ... where you--
- Just hit a little ball ?

167
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:32,995
Pretty much, yeah.

168
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:35,277
What’s so hard about that ?

169
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,401
Well, l make it look easy
but l’ve been playing since l was 6.

170
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:42,437
So although it seems simple...

171
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:47,084
... developing a sweet swing like mine
takes years--

172
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:53,882
Like that ?

173
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,399
- That was okay.
- Okay ? You can’t see where it landed.

174
00:10:57,567 --> 00:11:00,604
Well, it’s not a distance game,
it’s an accuracy one.

175
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:02,479
Pick a spot, l’Il hit it there.

176
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:04,406
First off, your grip :

177
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:05,881
It’s all wrong.

178
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:07,878
Oh, yes, of course. There you are.

179
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:10,436
l wanted see you.
l’ve been having this weird pain--

180
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:12,563
Hold on, sorry. Let me stop you there.

181
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:14,718
It’s the first day l’ve had off
in a month.

182
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:17,720
Dr. Cole is in the infirmary
and would be glad to help you.

183
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,923
- Okay. Fair enough.
- Right.

184
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:21,435
What’s up, Carson ?

185
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,797
- Fishing.
- What ?

186
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:27,761
Rodney and l are heading to the mainland
to catch a fish that’s like a trout.

187
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:30,487
Care to join us ? Sport of kings.

188
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,962
l thought horse racing was
the sport of kings.

189
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:35,086
For the boring kings, maybe.

190
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:37,238
Carson, you’re Scottish.
This is your game.

191
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:40,365
- Wouldn’t you rather be on the range ?
- It was never my thing.

192
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:42,085
Come on, last chance.

193
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,198
l think we’re gonna pass.

194
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:51,282
All right. Don’t be jealous when l return
with a record-breaking space trout.

195
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:52,721
Thank you.

196
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:56,677
- We’Il try to contain ourselves.
- Oh, aye.

197
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:04,679
Time for a real sport. Come on.

198
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:20,520
- Grab the other guy’s flag ? That’s it ?
- That’s it.

199
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,275
- No penalties and stuff ?
- What ?

200
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:26,564
Well, if the other guy pulls your hair
or tries to bite you ?

201
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:28,240
Bite back.

202
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:29,681
Right.

203
00:12:29,887 --> 00:12:33,846
- You ready ?
- Ready as l’Il ever be.

204
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:41,086
- That’s one for me.
- Two out of three.

205
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:46,085
- Round 2 : one-handed.
- What ?

206
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:50,280
After every round, the level of difficulty
is increased. It’s to simulate battle :

207
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:52,517
After an encounter,
the possibility of injury.

208
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,882
Round 2 : one-handed.

209
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:59,718
Let me get better at Round 1
before we move on to the harder part ?

210
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:04,281
Okay. Round 2.

211
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:14,721
- It’s two for me.
- Three out of five.

212
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:18,443
You know, l could do this all day.
Haven’t even broken a sweat yet.

213
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:20,325
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

214
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:23,725
Round 3.

215
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:29,398
Oh, come on.
Oh, you are making this stuff up.

216
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:31,518
This is not a traditional Satedan sport.

217
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,884
This is an excuse to make me look dumb
and kick my ass.

218
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,202
If you wanna quit...

219
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:49,920
Sorry.

220
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,165
- This game sucks.
- You need to focus.

221
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:56,325
l don’t know if that’s going
to be possible again.

222
00:13:58,527 --> 00:14:01,485
Here, help me get up. l got an idea.

223
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:06,277
It hurts, doesn’t it ?

224
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,998
- Like that ?
- Yeah, you gotta hit it...

225
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:13,164
- ... straight on, hard as you can.
- Okay.

226
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:16,837
This is what l’m talking about.
This is how you spend a day off :

227
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:20,363
Kick back, eat some junk food,
listen to some tunes.

228
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,676
You like this music ?

229
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,761
What ? You don’t ?

230
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:25,764
It’s fine.

231
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:28,121
l’m gonna stick to golf.

232
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:31,006
Your game’s a little too much
like my day job.

233
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:34,878
So, how long have you been here now ?
A year ?

234
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:37,282
- Year and a half.
- Year and a half ?

235
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:41,361
You ever hang out with anyone else
besides me and Teyla ?

236
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:44,321
l’m not saying we’re sick of you
or anything.

237
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:46,165
l don’t know. Are you dating anyone ?

238
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:47,516
You mean like a woman ?

239
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:49,196
Or a man ?

240
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:52,000
No.

241
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:54,799
l’m not ready yet.

242
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:58,801
Not ready yet ?

243
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,598
Did you leave somebody behind
on Sateda ?

244
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:07,160
Wife ?

245
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,959
Close enough.

246
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:14,156
Sorry.

247
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:16,636
What about you ?

248
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:18,445
Yeah, what about me ?

249
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:20,006
When are you getting married ?

250
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,800
l’ve already done that.
Not very good at it.

251
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:28,603
Besides there really isn’t
anyone here that-- Yeah, you know...

252
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:32,319
See, l always thought
you and Teyla would-- You know...

253
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:35,315
- Really ?
- Yeah. Why not ?

254
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:43,076
Bright lights. Go, move.

255
00:15:43,247 --> 00:15:46,717
All right, let’s get these two
to the O.R. right away.

256
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:50,039
- What happened here ?
- An explosion.

257
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:52,277
At least three dead,
a dozen or so injured.

258
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:53,926
Doc ?

259
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:57,199
Oh, Lord. Teyla.

260
00:15:57,367 --> 00:16:00,086
- She gonna be okay, doc ?
- She’s lost a great deal of blood.

261
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:03,757
- Get her to the infirmary, stat.
- Is she gonna be all right ?

262
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,639
Let’s go. Let’s move.

263
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:09,921
- What happened here, Radek ?
- There was an explosion.

264
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:12,043
- l get that, but why ?
- l’m not sure yet.

265
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:14,596
l wasn’t allowed in
till the crews cleared the floor.

266
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,883
- What took you so long ?
- Transporters are down.

267
00:16:17,047 --> 00:16:19,880
- Lots of stairs.
- McKay’s in his lab. Might have a lead.

268
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:21,639
- What kind of lead ?
- He didn’t say.

269
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:25,686
The good news is the structure is intact
so there’s no danger of the tower falling.

270
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:28,202
- There is, however, something very odd.
- What ?

271
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:30,318
The few eyewitness reports
that we have...

272
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:33,206
... say Dr. Hewston just blew up.

273
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:35,443
- What does that mean ?
- Is that even possible ?

274
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:37,962
Normally l’d agree
but from what we can tell...

275
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:40,721
... she was standing in the hall
and just exploded.

276
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:43,321
So what ? Suicide bomb ?

277
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:46,644
That’s what l thought too originally,
but l’ve scanned the area...

278
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:50,402
... and there isn’t even the slightest trace
of explosive residue.

279
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:54,476
We’ve no idea
what we’re dealing with here.

280
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:00,715
l’m a pretty easy guy to work for.

281
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:05,240
l am usually too busy
doing all the really important stuff...

282
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:08,007
... to micromanage the things
l need you to be doing.

283
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,921
Because of that,
you have a fair amount of freedom.

284
00:17:11,127 --> 00:17:13,436
That does not mean
you can do whatever you please.

285
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:17,003
There are rules, there are protocols,
not only to protect the city...

286
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,805
... but your sorry little existences.

287
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:21,919
- If l could just--
- You cannot. You cannot interrupt me.

288
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:24,726
l was having a wonderful dream
before l got this call.

289
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:26,360
You can stand there and listen.

290
00:17:26,727 --> 00:17:30,686
You were sent on a routine cataloging
of one of the abandoned Ancient labs...

291
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:33,839
... and you activate a device
without having a clue what it was ?

292
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:36,322
- We thought it was a--
- Yes. You thought wrong.

293
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:38,717
But the other week you did the same,
so l don’t--

294
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:43,039
But l am me. If l make a mistake,
l can fix it. You are you.

295
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:46,239
And when you make mistakes,
you don’t have to fix them. l do.

296
00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:49,479
The second we realized it was
emitting radiation, we turned it off.

297
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:51,126
So what ? What, you want a medal ?

298
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:54,677
My 4-year-old niece could too
if it was emitting radiation.

299
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:58,084
That does not make you smart
that just makes you a little less stupid.

300
00:17:58,247 --> 00:17:59,282
Rodney, be nice.

301
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:03,600
So ? Are they gonna live ?
More importantly, can l go back to bed ?

302
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:06,281
According to the scan and tests,
they’Il be all right.

303
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:08,364
You should check back in 24 hours.

304
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:10,165
We’Il run more tests to be certain.

305
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:13,797
You were lucky because we are
in a place where flipping a switch...

306
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,527
... could domino out into thousands
of people dying.

307
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:18,683
You need to be more careful.

308
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:23,118
Okay.

309
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:26,882
- Take tomorrow off, all right ?
- We already have tomorrow off.

310
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:28,685
It’s the mandatory rest day.

311
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:30,320
It is ?

312
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,205
Already ?

313
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:38,999
Oh, great.

314
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,080
Katie ?

315
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:52,637
Hello ? Katie ?

316
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:54,081
- Rodney.
- There you are.

317
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:57,006
- What are you doing here ?
- What are you doing here ?

318
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:00,637
Well, l’m nursing these little baby ferns
we found on M4L-279.

319
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,083
At this stage, they’re very fragile
and if l leave them too long...

320
00:19:04,247 --> 00:19:06,317
- ... they’Il die.
- So what ? They’re ferns.

321
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:11,445
Oh, which is to say, you need time off,
just like everyone else does.

322
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:15,885
l know, it’s just-- They produce
this enzyme that might cure leukemia.

323
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,556
- What ? These guys ? Really ?
- Yeah.

324
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:21,560
What are you doing with your day off ?
You had plans.

325
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:24,327
Oh, l do with Beckett.
That’s kind of why l’m here.

326
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:26,838
Yeah, l need an excuse
to break those plans.

327
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:29,038
- Why’s that ?
- Because we’re going fishing.

328
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:32,364
And to be honest, l cannot think
of a more torturous way...

329
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:37,078
... of spending a day than up to my hips
in water, getting worms on hooks...

330
00:19:37,287 --> 00:19:40,006
... and having all the time
to listen to Carson’s views...

331
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:43,557
... on what l’m sure are a vast number
of impossibly boring subjects.

332
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:45,877
l mean, it is unappealing in every way.

333
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:48,078
Why did you say yes in the first place ?

334
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,006
He said,« ou » ?You wanna go fishing
next month ? » It sounded far.

335
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,601
Something could come up,
l’d be able to get out of it.

336
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,962
- Here we are a month later--
- Nothing’s come up.

337
00:19:56,127 --> 00:20:00,325
Exactly. So if l told him we finally had
an afternoon where l could...

338
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:02,398
... take you out to lunch
or something...

339
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:04,080
... then he’d have no choice.

340
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:06,761
l can’t. l need to baby-sit the ferns.

341
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:11,085
Right. Well, if l had a nickel
for every time a girl used that line...

342
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:14,882
You know what ?
Let me bring lunch to you.

343
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,720
- We can eat here.
- You wanna baby-sit ferns with me ?

344
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:21,556
In the battle between ferns versus fish,
ferns win a decisive victory.

345
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:24,725
- That would be lovely.
- Great. Okay. l’Il be right back.

346
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:26,320
Okay.

347
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:42,516
Would you look at that ?
Great minds think alike.

348
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:46,157
- l thought l’d pick us up snacks as well.
- Yes. About that.

349
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:48,166
- Rodney.
- Here’s the thing.

350
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:50,318
- You know l’d love to go with you.
- l don’t.

351
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:53,126
l would. l do.
l just ran into Katie Brown.

352
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:54,640
She laid the guilt on...

353
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:57,241
... how l never see her,
how the one day l get off...

354
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:59,796
... l’m off to the coast to fish
with my best buddy.

355
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:03,443
She and l see so little of each other.
Not sure we count as a couple. Look.

356
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:05,725
- Long story short.
- Too late.

357
00:21:05,927 --> 00:21:08,566
l told Katie l would spend
the day with her.

358
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:12,238
- All right.
- If it was anybody else--

359
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:13,396
No, no, l understand.

360
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,882
Yeah, next week.
l’m 100 percent there.

361
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,876
- You promise ?
- Absolutely.

362
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:20,921
- Okay.
- It’s still early.

363
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:23,726
- l’m sure you’Il find someone else.
- You can bet on that.

364
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:26,646
Well, tell Katie l said hello.

365
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:29,367
- Will do.
- Enjoy.

366
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:30,960
l will.

367
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:33,119
Yes.

368
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:39,281
This is lovely.

369
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:40,675
It is, yes.

370
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:44,283
l got to say, after all
the Cadman craziness last year...

371
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:47,245
... l figured there was no chance for us.

372
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,123
- Why’s that ?
- You had another consciousness...

373
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:53,518
... in your body, one that took over
during our first date...

374
00:21:53,727 --> 00:21:55,922
... and made you kiss me.

375
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:58,555
l mean, it was awkward.

376
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:01,517
- So you ignored me for a few months.
- l did not.

377
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:05,083
Yeah. Yes, you did.
l mean, it’s okay, l guess.

378
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:07,597
l can’t imagine going through that...

379
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:09,997
... and l wouldn’t wanna be
reminded of it either.

380
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:12,522
Yes, well, it was a little weird
there for a bit.

381
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:14,006
For the last little while...

382
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,926
... you’ve really made an effort
to make time for me.

383
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:20,278
And it has been lovely.

384
00:22:23,047 --> 00:22:24,799
It’s funny, you know ?

385
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:28,158
As much as l hate to admit it,
seeing my little sister so happy...

386
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:30,283
... with her family, l just--

387
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:33,475
Well, it kind of made me realize that--

388
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:35,246
Well...

389
00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:37,358
... l’d like to get married.

390
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:39,119
You would ?

391
00:22:39,287 --> 00:22:40,879
Oh, no. Not to you.

392
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:42,965
Oh, no, no, no.

393
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:46,403
Not to you. l was--
That was not a proposal. l was just...

394
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:47,642
- ... talking.
- Right.

395
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:48,796
Don’t get the wrong--

396
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,481
It’s not l wouldn’t be interested
in getting married...

397
00:22:51,647 --> 00:22:55,162
... to someone like you. Just like you.
You even maybe. One day. l just--

398
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:57,244
l know, l know. It’s okay.

399
00:22:57,447 --> 00:23:00,086
l like you a lot. l mean, l do.

400
00:23:00,287 --> 00:23:02,721
l know you do and l like you a lot too.

401
00:23:03,527 --> 00:23:05,119
l know.

402
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:09,242
And to be honest,
l find that just baffling.

403
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:10,766
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

404
00:23:10,927 --> 00:23:12,565
Other people find it baffling too.

405
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,803
l guess they don’t know you
like l know you.

406
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:16,281
But that’s what scares me.

407
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:18,642
l mean, you’Il know me
the way they know me--

408
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:20,525
l think l know you pretty well.

409
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:22,843
There’s not a lot of subtext with you.

410
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:27,004
l am really sorry...

411
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:29,476
... that l ignored you all that time.

412
00:23:30,807 --> 00:23:32,160
l bet you are.

413
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:38,802
- What was that ?
- l don’t know. Look, l gotta go.

414
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:43,118
So what ? Suicide bomb ?

415
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:47,405
That’s what l thought too originally,
but l’ve scanned the area...

416
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:50,718
... and there isn’t even the slightest trace
of explosive residue.

417
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:53,037
l’ve no idea
what we’re dealing with here.

418
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:56,080
<i>-Zelenka, do you read ?</i>
- Yes, l’m here with Sheppard and Ronon.

419
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:59,045
- What have you got ?
<i>-You’re all gonna wanna see this.</i>

420
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:05,076
All right. l’m digesting this as l go,
so forgive the rough edges.

421
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:06,999
- What do you got ?
- Now, last night...

422
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:09,317
... Dr. Hewston and her partner,
Dr. Watson...

423
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:11,762
... were cataloging a new Ancient lab
we uncovered.

424
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:15,317
They inadvertently activated
this machine.

425
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,876
It started to emit a very odd type
of radiation...

426
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:20,242
... but they were able to turn it off
right away.

427
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:23,444
Dr. Beckett examined them
and gave them a clean bill of health.

428
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:25,438
So with no immediate,
apparent danger...

429
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:28,041
... we decided to figure out
what the device was...

430
00:24:28,207 --> 00:24:29,356
... whenever we had time.

431
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:31,797
- That was a mistake.
- What is it ?

432
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:35,716
Well, the science of it is--
Well, it’s spectacularly complicated.

433
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:39,118
It appears to be a weapon created
by the Ancients to battle the Wraith.

434
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:42,882
One that was abandoned fairly early on
as it affected everyone in proximity...

435
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:46,676
- ... including Ancients and humans.
- Affected them how ?

436
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:51,039
Well, long story short,
it creates explosive tumors.

437
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:53,158
- Explosive tumors ?
- What ?

438
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,397
- Are you kidding me ?
- Yeah, l wish. Look.

439
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:56,761
It’s actually ingenious.

440
00:24:56,927 --> 00:25:00,158
Look, the device emits millions
of irradiated particles...

441
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:03,763
... genetically programmed to enter
our systems and gather behind the lungs.

442
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:06,077
Now, as they go,
they collect trace elements...

443
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:09,677
... from our body that they need
to complete an explosive compound...

444
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:14,284
... which, once in place, the tumor
reaches critical mass and explodes.

445
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:16,717
- Wait. This guy, Watson--
- Has been exposed.

446
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:20,118
Find him before the tumor ignites,
which could be any minute now.

447
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:22,881
It’s not good but not awful.
We need to start right away.

448
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:24,560
What’s his name ?

449
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:27,687
James. James Watson.

450
00:25:34,647 --> 00:25:36,877
Next week, l am 100 percent there.

451
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:38,400
- You promise ?
- Absolutely.

452
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:40,606
- Okay.
- It’s still early.

453
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:43,600
- l’m sure you’Il find someone else.
- You can bet on that.

454
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,962
Well, tell Katie l said, hello.

455
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,526
- Yeah. Will do.
- Enjoy.

456
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:49,040
l will.

457
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:01,117
- Son of a bitch. Stop that.
- Stop what ? Winning ?

458
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:03,084
- You haven’t won yet.
- Carson.

459
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:05,203
- Come to join the chess club ?
- Not quite.

460
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:07,125
- You’ve come to watch ?
- Well...

461
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:11,200
... no, actually, l’m looking for someone
to come fishing with me. Rodney bailed.

462
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:13,638
- Surprise, surprise.
- l know. Any interest ?

463
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:15,718
l would but we’re playing
for trades today.

464
00:26:15,887 --> 00:26:18,321
No one can really beat me, so--
l’ve won a desk fan...

465
00:26:18,487 --> 00:26:20,955
... Dr. Mallozzi’s anime DVD collection...

466
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:25,120
... and coupon for a Swedish massage
from Dr. Ambrose.

467
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:29,996
- Perhaps we can go fishing next week ?
- Okay, all right, best of luck to you.

468
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:32,237
Oh, l don’t need luck.

469
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:36,077
- Checkmate.
- Son of a bitch.

470
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:46,282
- You paint ?
- Hey, doc.

471
00:26:46,927 --> 00:26:48,997
Yeah. l paint.

472
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,486
And you’re good too.

473
00:26:50,647 --> 00:26:54,162
My mom was an art teacher.
It’s what we did on weekends.

474
00:26:54,327 --> 00:26:57,319
l stopped for a while.
Didn’t have time during basic training...

475
00:26:57,487 --> 00:26:59,762
... and the first couple
of years on duty...

476
00:26:59,927 --> 00:27:03,317
... but l’ve been picking it up again.
Hard not to, with views like that.

477
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:05,079
Aye.

478
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:09,555
l don’t suppose there’s any chance
you’d like to come fishing with me ?

479
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:14,557
If you’d got to me earlier, maybe,
but l kind of want to finish this up.

480
00:27:16,247 --> 00:27:17,362
It looks done to me.

481
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:22,601
That is why l am the painter
and you are the doctor.

482
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,520
Very good point.
Enjoy the rest of your day, major.

483
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,325
Oh, you can count on it.

484
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,922
- Oh, hey there, sir.
- Hello. l was--

485
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:35,521
You know what’s crazy ?
l was just thinking about you.

486
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:37,206
Does that ever happen to you ?

487
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:40,086
You’re thinking about something,
and boom, there it is.

488
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:42,357
It’s not that l’m psychic
but who knows ?

489
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:44,956
- Well, actually--
- You know what ? l am sorry.

490
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:48,079
You were trying to say something
and l interrupted you.

491
00:27:48,247 --> 00:27:50,715
Enjoy your day off, Dr. Biro.

492
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:52,076
Absolutely.

493
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:53,561
Bye-bye.

494
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:01,276
Slow day ?

495
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:03,836
Carson. What are you doing here ?
It’s your day off.

496
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:06,925
My fishing trip is a bust
so l figured l’d come here...

497
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:09,726
... and catch up on some paperwork
for the first time.

498
00:28:09,927 --> 00:28:11,645
- Well, that’s a shame.
- Aye, it is.

499
00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:17,678
- You all right ?
- A migraine.

500
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:20,042
It’s a bad one, actually.
l took some stuff...

501
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:23,165
... but l can’t take any more,
being the on-call and everything.

502
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,795
- You should have radioed me.
- You kidding ?

503
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:29,323
No way. You’ve been talking
about that fishing trip for two weeks.

504
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:31,765
l’m not going now, so off you go.

505
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:33,366
l’Il cover your shift.

506
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:35,916
- You sure ?
- Aye, there’s nothing happening here.

507
00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:37,839
You go take a horse pill and rest.

508
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:39,400
Oh, you’re a lifesaver.

509
00:28:39,607 --> 00:28:43,156
- l know.
- Thanks, Carson. Thanks.

510
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:45,045
You’re welcome.

511
00:28:48,047 --> 00:28:51,881
If you’re going to play volleyball,
you’re going to need proper gym shoes.

512
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:53,082
l know.

513
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:56,159
l’ve put an order. It takes forever
to get things from Earth...

514
00:28:56,327 --> 00:28:58,795
... that aren’t vital to the success
of the missions.

515
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:01,720
You, young lady, are vital
to the success of the missions...

516
00:29:01,927 --> 00:29:04,999
- ... so don’t play sports in sandals, okay ?
- Okay, doc.

517
00:29:05,207 --> 00:29:09,280
All right, we’re all done here.
We’Il fix you up some crutches and--

518
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:12,922
Meyers, call in every nurse
and doctor immediately.

519
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:16,124
You, grab two field kits and a couple
of stretchers and follow me.

520
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,357
Beckett. What happened ?
Where do you need me ?

521
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:20,604
- What happened here ?
- An explosion.

522
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:22,758
At least three dead,
a dozen or so injured.

523
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,485
Doc ?

524
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:28,680
Teyla.

525
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:31,240
- Carson.
- l’m here.

526
00:29:31,407 --> 00:29:34,604
You’ve been in an explosion.
A piece of debris has impacted your side.

527
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:37,002
We’Il take it out and patch you up.

528
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:39,840
Easy-peasy.
l can do this one in my sleep.

529
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:43,556
All right, all set ?

530
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:44,916
Thank you.

531
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:46,918
Can’t believe you got
the artery cleaned.

532
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:49,561
They don’t make you head surgeon
if you’re all thumbs.

533
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:53,164
You have another patient waiting.
He got his leg cut up bad.

534
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:56,080
We’re done here. Let’s get her
to recovery and get him in.

535
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:57,362
- Okay.
- Long story short...

536
00:29:57,807 --> 00:29:59,365
... it creates explosive tumors.

537
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:00,562
Explosive tumors ?

538
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:02,519
- Are you kidding me ?
- l wish l was.

539
00:30:02,687 --> 00:30:05,440
- Wait. This guy Watson--
- Has been exposed.

540
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:08,724
Find him before the tumor ignites,
which could be any minute now.

541
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:11,481
It’s not good but not awful.
We need to start right away.

542
00:30:11,647 --> 00:30:12,762
What’s his name ?

543
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:14,605
James, James Watson.

544
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:16,166
Watson ?

545
00:30:16,327 --> 00:30:19,046
Poor lad was in here last night.
He’s had a run of bad luck.

546
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:24,406
<i>Dr. Watson, Dr. James Watson,</i>
<i>report your whereabouts immediately.</i>

547
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:27,877
Well, aren’t you popular ?
Go see what that’s about, please.

548
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:30,799
He’s in the O.R. right now ?

549
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:33,435
l need you to get Beckett
back on his radio.

550
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:35,444
It’s Dr. McKay.

551
00:30:35,607 --> 00:30:37,996
- What is it ? l’m a little busy right now.
<i>-Carson.</i>

552
00:30:38,207 --> 00:30:41,085
The man has been infected
with an explosive tumor.

553
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:43,044
<i>It killed Hewston,</i>
<i>caused the explosion.</i>

554
00:30:43,247 --> 00:30:46,603
- What are you talking about ? That’s--
- <i>It is possible, Carson.</i>

555
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:48,997
You need to get you
and your team out of there.

556
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:50,998
An ordnance disposal crew is
on the way.

557
00:30:51,207 --> 00:30:52,606
He’s too fragile to move now.

558
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:55,446
He doesn’t have to move.
You do.

559
00:30:58,287 --> 00:31:00,960
Listen up. l need everyone
to clear the floor right now.

560
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:03,357
l’m enacting a Protocol 7 for this level.

561
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:05,558
Move it, people.
Right, he stays, you go.

562
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:07,240
- What about you ?
- l’m staying put.

563
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,159
- So am l.
- No time to fight about this.

564
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,921
- You can’t do this on your own.
- Oh, God.

565
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,840
Thank you. All right,
let’s get the scanner in place...

566
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,157
... we have a tumor to remove.

567
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:31,283
He’s used his authorization code
to seal off the whole level.

568
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:32,482
We can’t get to him.

569
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:35,957
Carson, you cannot seriously
be considering operating on this guy.

570
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:37,719
Exactly how much time do l have ?

571
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:39,559
<i>There is no way to know for sure.</i>

572
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:43,476
Hewston was infected at the same time
that Watson was. Her tumor’s exploded.

573
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:46,804
No time to waste, then.

574
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:48,156
<i>making first incision.</i>

575
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:50,318
Okay, this is all very brave
and all, but--

576
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:52,637
What if the explosion
causes structural damage ?

577
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:54,798
- What if the tower comes down ?
- Exactly.

578
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:59,040
Sending him to the other side of the city
and leaving him is tantamount to murder.

579
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:00,356
The man is already dead.

580
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,319
- Like hell he is.
<i>-Carson.</i>

581
00:32:02,527 --> 00:32:05,724
- l can’t order you to stand down, but--
- <i>That’s right, you can’t.</i>

582
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:07,155
Have your men standing by.

583
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:09,795
l’Il open the access
once l’ve extracted the tumor.

584
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:11,804
<i>Beckett out.</i>

585
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,797
- How long has he been at it ?
- Ten minutes.

586
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:22,527
Emergency crew’s standing by.
Either way, we’re covered.

587
00:32:22,727 --> 00:32:25,241
- Can’t you bypass his code ?
- That’Il take half an hour.

588
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:28,240
- If he’s not done removing it by then--
- This is crazy.

589
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:54,718
Colonel Sheppard,
l’ve extracted the tumor...

590
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:57,481
... and l’m opening up the O.R. level.

591
00:33:11,847 --> 00:33:14,407
<i>He’s on his way. Sit tight.</i>

592
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:20,279
- Damn it. Tell him l’Il meet him half way.
<i>-Just stay put, doc.</i>

593
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:23,645
The sooner l get this thing out
of my sight, the better.

594
00:33:23,887 --> 00:33:26,321
You finish closing him up, please.

595
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:29,164
l’Il be right back.

596
00:33:39,647 --> 00:33:43,356
Easy. Easy.

597
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:52,398
Thank you.

598
00:33:53,287 --> 00:33:55,323
We just made the handoff.

599
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:23,246
Hey.

600
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:24,920
Hey.

601
00:34:27,087 --> 00:34:28,076
You okay ?

602
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:32,836
Not really.

603
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:35,559
- You need some help ?
- No.

604
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:37,598
l’m almost done.

605
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:40,357
He didn’t have a lot of stuff here.

606
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:43,156
- You sending it all back to his family ?
- Yeah.

607
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:45,039
Well, l mean, we--

608
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:47,642
We will. They don’t know yet.

609
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:50,122
We’re going to send...

610
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:51,676
... the body...

611
00:34:51,887 --> 00:34:53,525
... back to Earth, and...

612
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,563
l’m gonna tell his mother.

613
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:03,122
- l should have just gone fishing with him.
- Don’t.

614
00:35:03,287 --> 00:35:05,357
No, if l’d gone fishing...

615
00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:08,644
... if l’d checked the machine,
hadn’t assigned junior guys--

616
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,081
Rodney.

617
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:12,084
What’s done is done.

618
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:14,118
l know.

619
00:35:15,127 --> 00:35:16,765
And...

620
00:35:17,127 --> 00:35:19,118
... that’s what’s killing me.

621
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:36,404
- Where do you think you’re going ?
- l’d like to go to the memorial.

622
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,478
l don’t think you should be going
anywhere.

623
00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:40,365
l’m fine.

624
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:43,600
All right.

625
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,485
- l’Il get a wheelchair.
- No.

626
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:49,202
l would like to stand.
As a testament to him.

627
00:35:51,247 --> 00:35:52,600
How are you doing ?

628
00:35:52,807 --> 00:35:54,081
Me ?

629
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:57,603
Fine, but l didn’t get major surgery
two days ago.

630
00:35:57,767 --> 00:35:59,883
That is not what l meant.

631
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:03,522
Well, it hasn’t hit me yet.

632
00:36:05,527 --> 00:36:08,325
l’m not looking forward to it
when it does.

633
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,801
l feel a great sadness.

634
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,440
He--

635
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,437
l feel a great sadness.

636
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:23,524
Yeah, l got you.

637
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:45,399
We’ve said goodbye
to a lot of friends today.

638
00:36:47,127 --> 00:36:49,800
Our mission is a dangerous one.

639
00:36:50,327 --> 00:36:52,283
We lose people.

640
00:36:52,687 --> 00:36:56,475
A fact we’re all painfully aware of.

641
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:01,482
But Carson was...

642
00:37:07,127 --> 00:37:10,563
l can’t remember anyone coming
to me with a complaint against him.

643
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:13,120
Ever.

644
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:21,197
He was a kind soul.

645
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:23,725
He was...

646
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:28,443
He was a healer...

647
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:32,718
... and he will be very deeply missed.

648
00:37:34,407 --> 00:37:36,398
George Fabricius said :

649
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:39,801
« Death comes to us all...

650
00:37:40,807 --> 00:37:43,116
... but great achievements...

651
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:45,997
... they build a monument
which shall endure...

652
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:47,885
... until the sun grows cold. »

653
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:53,957
Every single life Carson saved...

654
00:37:54,527 --> 00:37:56,563
... is a monument to him.

655
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:02,122
And that gives me great comfort.

656
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:40,202
How’d it go back on Earth ?

657
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:43,601
It was-- It was awful.

658
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:47,562
Your family was amazing, though.

659
00:39:47,727 --> 00:39:49,763
Aye, they are. Good turnout ?

660
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:50,996
Packed the church.

661
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:53,522
Oh, that’s good to hear.

662
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:57,358
It’s not gonna be the same here
without you.

663
00:39:57,567 --> 00:39:59,797
Oh, you’re telling me...

664
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:02,240
You know...

665
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,080
... universe is a big place.

666
00:40:04,287 --> 00:40:06,517
Who knows ? Maybe we’Il...

667
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:08,644
- ... bump into each other again.
- Aye.

668
