0
00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:06,124
- We must go faster, Rodney.
- This is pretty much my top gear.

1
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:14,238
If we make a stand here,
we can take them.

2
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:17,205
Negative. We don’t know
how many we’re up against.

3
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:21,121
Rodney, dial the damn gate.
Don’t wait for us.

4
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:25,240
As if the bullets whizzing past my
head weren’t encouragement enough.

5
00:00:27,687 --> 00:00:30,406
Okay, six, seven.

6
00:00:32,327 --> 00:00:34,477
This is McKay to Atlantis.
We’re coming in hot.

7
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:02,959
It’s good to see you again, colonel.

8
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:07,444
Kolya.

9
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:15,436
Anything ?

10
00:02:15,607 --> 00:02:17,643
There’s no sign of
Sheppard or our attackers.

11
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:20,844
- They covered their tracks.
- There’s a chance he was transported.

12
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,316
l’ve gathered the last 50
gate addresses dialed.

13
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:24,522
That should be helpful.

14
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,281
Since the transmission which
summoned us to the planet...

15
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,642
... was sent using a code we gave
to the Genii...

16
00:02:29,807 --> 00:02:32,526
- ... that will be our starting point.
- What are you gonna do ?

17
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:34,598
Ask the Genii if one of them took
Sheppard ?

18
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:36,519
Yes, l am.

19
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:40,724
- So is this-- ?
- Yes, it is.

20
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,360
<i>Incoming wormhole.</i>

21
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:44,643
<i>We’re receiving</i>
<i>the new identification code.</i>

22
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:48,163
Security teams, stand by.
Lower the shield.

23
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:55,558
- Welcome, Ladon.
- l came as soon as l--

24
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:59,316
- What’ve you done with Sheppard ?
- Ronon. He is here as our guest.

25
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,756
How can l help ?

26
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,518
Kolya.

27
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:13,164
l didn’t kill you last time, remember ?

28
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:18,203
You promised me points for that.

29
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:20,005
Kolya.

30
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:21,640
Damn it.

31
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:26,597
- l should have killed him.
- You’re wasting your breath.

32
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:30,323
Didn’t know l had company
down here.

33
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:32,637
There is no escape.

34
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:36,595
Yeah, well, prisons are like that.

35
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:39,201
Never stopped me before.

36
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:42,124
How long have you been down here ?

37
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:44,716
Many years.

38
00:03:44,887 --> 00:03:47,082
How many is many ? Five ? Ten ?

39
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:50,717
- It no longer matters.
- That many ?

40
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,676
What did you do to get here ?

41
00:03:54,847 --> 00:04:00,240
l merely allowed myself
to be captured alive.

42
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:02,564
Same here.

43
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:06,405
Look, l got people looking for me.

44
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:08,842
When they find me,
maybe we can both--

45
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:23,683
- Move.
- Where are we moving to ?

46
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:27,725
l kind of like it here.

47
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:33,765
Commander Kolya insists.

48
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:38,086
Oh, he insists ?
Well, why didn’t you just say so ?

49
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:47,560
Pick him up.

50
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,600
l’m sorry this is necessary...

51
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,156
... under the circumstances,
l’m sure you understand.

52
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:09,165
l came here as a friend, Dr. Weir.
l hope to leave as one.

53
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:11,756
And we appreciate your concern
for Colonel Sheppard.

54
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:14,760
Despite that it was your
incompetence that led to his capture.

55
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:16,963
- Rodney.
- l’m sorry. There is no disputing...

56
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:18,606
... it was a code we provided...

57
00:05:18,807 --> 00:05:21,844
... that was used to lure us to that
planet where we were ambushed.

58
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:23,725
Dr. McKay is quite correct.

59
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:26,685
You entrusted us with codes,
and l allowed them to be stolen.

60
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:28,883
How and by whom is
an ongoing investigation.

61
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:31,083
But l must assume it was someone
close to me.

62
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,965
Or this is part of your plans.

63
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:34,756
Excuse me ?

64
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,798
It would not be the first time.

65
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:40,798
l say this rhetorically,
since l should think it is obvious...

66
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,083
... but if l were involved
in this in any way...

67
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:46,159
... or if my intentions were anything
less than honorable...

68
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:47,919
... would l have come to Atlantis ?

69
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:49,759
With you, who knows ?
All l know is...

70
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:53,078
... my friend has been kidnapped
and you had something to do with it.

71
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:56,404
Which is why l have walked away
from significant responsibilities...

72
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:59,525
... as leader of my people
to come here and offer our help.

73
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,803
Now you can either let me do that...

74
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:05,357
... or you can continue to berate me
for my mistake. The choice is yours.

75
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,478
- We have more choices than that.
- Ronon.

76
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:10,960
l see no reason to stay
if this is how l am to be treated.

77
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:12,885
Trust me, you’re not going anywhere.

78
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:16,278
Ronon, l understand how you feel.
Believe me, l do.

79
00:06:16,447 --> 00:06:18,165
But we’re gonna deal
with this my way.

80
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,397
Let’s continue this in my office...

81
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:25,602
... privately.

82
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:42,600
It’s been some time.

83
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:46,038
You must have really missed me
to go through all this trouble.

84
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:48,639
Nice harpoon, by the way.

85
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:51,884
To capture an extraordinary soldier
takes extraordinary measures.

86
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:54,647
- l’Il take that as a compliment.
- As you should.

87
00:06:55,807 --> 00:06:58,321
Just as you should understand
this is not personal.

88
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:01,479
As soon as my goal is achieved,
you’Il be returned to Atlantis.

89
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:02,762
That simple ?

90
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:05,075
What do you want ?

91
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:08,887
It’s not a question of what l want.

92
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:11,003
It’s a question of who.

93
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:13,480
Now, l entrusted the IDC codes
you provided...

94
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:15,080
... to two men in my government.

95
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:17,317
My second minister in the event
of my death...

96
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:19,398
and my personal assistant,
Cassel Massan.

97
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:21,762
l trust both of these men implicitly...

98
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,316
... or rather, l did.

99
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,283
- Are both men now accounted for ?
- Yes.

100
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:29,041
They’re in custody. They’re being
questioned as we speak.

101
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:30,726
Really ?

102
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:33,478
Don’t underestimate this alliance...

103
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:35,922
... between our two peoples
to the Genii, Dr. Weir.

104
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,643
When l heard the news,
my first concern--

105
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:41,480
<i>We have an unscheduled</i>
<i>off-world activation.</i>

106
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:44,596
Identification code ?

107
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:47,645
None, but we’re receiving
an analog video signal.

108
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:49,035
Bring it up.

109
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:52,963
<i>Dr. Weir, if you’re receiving this,</i>
<i>please respond.</i>

110
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,963
- Who the hell is he ?
- Acastus Kolya.

111
00:07:57,167 --> 00:08:00,477
A Genii military leader who once
tried to seize Atlantis.

112
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,842
Ladon was a member
of his strike team.

113
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:05,599
<i>I do know you’re there, doctor.</i>

114
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:08,685
<i>The existence of Atlantis</i>
<i>is no secret among the Genii.</i>

115
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:12,677
<i>It would be pointless</i>
<i>not to answer.</i>

116
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:14,798
Open a channel.

117
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,640
This is Dr. Weir.

118
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:19,644
<i>Oh, good.</i>

119
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:22,879
<i>I wanted to be certain</i>
<i>you were there to see this.</i>

120
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:27,162
- What have you done to him ?
<i>-Nothing whatsoever.</i>

121
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:29,927
Let me rephrase that.
What are you planning to do ?

122
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:33,005
<i>Oh, it’s quite simple.</i>
<i>I’d like to make a trade.</i>

123
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:36,404
Before we continue this conversation,
l want to speak with Sheppard.

124
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:38,046
<i>Be my guest.</i>

125
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:41,802
We’Il rephrase that too. We would
like him to be able to speak to us.

126
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:44,605
<i>Very well.</i>

127
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,040
<i>On my command authority,</i>
<i>whatever he asks, don’t do it--</i>

128
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:55,401
<i>Well, as you can see,</i>
<i>he’s his usual charming self.</i>

129
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:57,802
Explain your terms, Kolya.

130
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:03,236
<i>I have heard the familiar voices</i>
<i>of yourself and Dr. mcKay...</i>

131
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:06,638
<i>... but there is one person I know</i>
<i>is there who has yet to speak.</i>

132
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,604
<i>Ladon Radim is with you, is he not ?</i>

133
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:12,802
Why would Ladon be here ?

134
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:15,726
<i>Well, to preserve his precious</i>
<i>alliance with you, doctor.</i>

135
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:18,526
<i>So that the Genii might remain</i>
<i>in the favor of Atlantis.</i>

136
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:20,723
<i>my sources have</i>
<i>already confirmed this...</i>

137
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:23,765
<i>... there’s no point in denying</i>
<i>the fact. Turn him over to me...</i>

138
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:26,395
<i>... and Colonel Sheppard will be</i>
<i>released immediately.</i>

139
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:36,047
l’Il need time to consider your offer.

140
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:39,000
<i>Allow me to help expedite</i>
<i>your decision.</i>

141
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:46,201
Oh, my God.

142
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:49,646
<i>Sheppard could have left you</i>
<i>in that hole when we last met.</i>

143
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:52,765
<i>-He does not deserve this.</i>
- Let’s be clear, Dr. McKay.

144
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,640
- No one does.
<i>-Don’t do this.</i>

145
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:59,600
<i>-Don’t do it.</i>
- The choice is yours, Dr. Weir.

146
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,803
<i>Do we have an arrangement ?</i>

147
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:08,436
<i>Very well.</i>

148
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:21,604
<i>Stop ! Stop !</i>

149
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:22,916
Enough.

150
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:37,364
You just crossed a line, Kolya.

151
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:40,724
<i>We found that a minimum of three</i>
<i>hours between feeding sessions...</i>

152
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:43,685
<i>... is crucial to ensure the body</i>
<i>has sufficient time...</i>

153
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,246
<i>... to recover from the trauma.</i>

154
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:47,677
<i>That’s the time you have to decide.</i>

155
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,316
<i>Three hours.</i>

156
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:03,566
- They called you Sheppard.
- Yeah.

157
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:06,163
That’s my name.

158
00:11:06,327 --> 00:11:08,397
Pleased to meet you.

159
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:11,403
You are in pain.

160
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:15,365
Well, l just got fed on by a Wraith,
what do you think ?

161
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:16,880
l would not know.

162
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:19,959
Yeah, hopefully,
you’Il never have to find out.

163
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,037
l didn’t think anything
could hurt that much.

164
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,516
You’re still alive.

165
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,440
Yeah. Well...

166
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:35,156
... l don’t know how many years
the darned thing took off my life.

167
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,760
But l’Il tell you this...

168
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:40,078
... if Kolya’s men hadn’t have pulled
that damned thing off...

169
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:42,807
... l’d be dust in a flak jacket.

170
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:45,083
Do you blame the Wraith...

171
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,203
... or the master ?

172
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,038
l’m gonna go with both.

173
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:52,522
There is a difference.

174
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:55,805
The Wraith must feed in order to live.

175
00:11:57,607 --> 00:12:02,397
For a Wraith, hunger burns like a fire.

176
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:06,401
Tell me, Sheppard...

177
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:10,560
... if you found yourself
burning alive...

178
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:15,323
... would you settle
for just one drop of water...

179
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:18,036
... or would you take more ?

180
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:22,517
Where did you hear them
call me Sheppard ?

181
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,603
Just before l started to feed.

182
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:36,236
Of course, you would see him
only as the monster...

183
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,238
... who tried to take your city
from you.

184
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:41,524
Kolya also killed several of our people.

185
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:43,962
He would have killed Dr. Weir as well.

186
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:46,243
l won’t make excuses for his actions
or mine...

187
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,159
... during the failed Atlantis mission.

188
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:50,045
We were soldiers under Cowen’s
orders.

189
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:53,244
But that failure shattered Kolya’s
stature among the Genii.

190
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,238
It forced him
from Cowen’s inner circle.

191
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:57,355
You managed to stay.

192
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:00,045
Cowen had no choice but to keep me.

193
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:01,481
l was his chief scientist.

194
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,166
You left Kolya out in the cold ?

195
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:05,477
That was his choice, not mine.

196
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,363
l will admit, in what little contact
we had...

197
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:10,324
... before Kolya went underground...

198
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:12,876
... he spoke of overthrowing
Cowen’s corrupt regime.

199
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:14,719
And l was admittedly torn.

200
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,360
Out of loyalty to Cowen ?

201
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:19,001
Out of the belief that neither man
had what it took...

202
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,805
... to lead the Genii
into the future.

203
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:24,317
So instead, you, having what it took
overthrew Cowen yourself ?

204
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:28,082
Kolya believes l’ve taken his rightful
place as leader of our people.

205
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:29,515
No wonder he’s pissed.

206
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,036
Well, obviously he has men
loyal to him...

207
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:35,085
... in your inner circle,
hence the codes.

208
00:13:35,287 --> 00:13:38,836
- Well, those traitors will be found.
- Sounds like you’re the traitor to me.

209
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,002
Must he be here ?

210
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:43,846
The more l hear,
the more l’m glad he is.

211
00:13:46,247 --> 00:13:49,080
l could have told you anything.
l chose to tell you the truth.

212
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:54,037
If you trade my life for Sheppard,
you will not only yield to blackmail...

213
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:56,516
... but you will be planting
the seeds of civil war.

214
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:59,326
So what ? l say we turn him over
and let them fight it out.

215
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:01,040
- We can’t do that.
- Why not ?

216
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,004
Because.

217
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:05,678
Well, can we ?

218
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,003
Colonel Sheppard
has already ordered us not to.

219
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:12,521
At this point, it’s not his decision.

220
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:16,163
There’s still time for us to find him
and launch a rescue operation.

221
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:19,046
- Has there been any progress ?
- We have a list of planets...

222
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:21,516
... where recent Genii activity’s
been documented...

223
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:24,247
... we’d have a much higher margin
of success if Ladon...

224
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:27,558
... would point out firm locations of
Genii safe houses and shelters.

225
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,406
Maybe even hidden
Wraith-infested torture chambers.

226
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:41,718
Your anger will only weaken you.

227
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:43,645
l don’t think so.

228
00:14:45,447 --> 00:14:48,166
Do you realize he is torturing
both of us ?

229
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:51,125
- Oh, yeah ? What’d he do to you ?
- He stopped me.

230
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:53,721
Really ? And how is that torture ?

231
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,846
Have you ever known starvation,
Sheppard ?

232
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:02,683
The few years l took from you
are barely enough to keep me alive.

233
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:05,805
The strength l gained from you
is already fading.

234
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:07,042
l don’t give a damn.

235
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:11,997
You pace in your cell,
cursing that l took years from you.

236
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:15,682
l stand here cursing
that l was not allowed them all.

237
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:20,445
Each in our own way, we suffer.

238
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:23,558
This might come as a surprise
to you...

239
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:26,764
... but l’m not really in the mood
for conversation.

240
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:30,681
So why don’t you just do me a favor
and shut the hell up !

241
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:35,957
These are your last hours, Sheppard.

242
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:38,436
If you wish to spend them
in silence...

243
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:41,679
... then so be it.

244
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:44,441
No. l’m getting out of here.

245
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:49,163
l got a life to go back to
and l’m damn well going back to it.

246
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:54,122
- You’re sure of that ?
- Yeah. l got friends.

247
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:56,925
And they’re gonna come for me.

248
00:15:57,127 --> 00:16:00,756
l hope you continue to believe that...

249
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,600
... the next time l feed.

250
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:10,317
l’m just saying, if you decide in favor
of trading for Col. Sheppard...

251
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:13,285
... it would be best if you did so
before the next feeding.

252
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:15,642
l don’t know how many sessions
a man can take...

253
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:17,599
... even someone as strong
as Sheppard.

254
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:20,241
Is it possible he can recover
from this ?

255
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:23,245
We still know so little
about the feeding process.

256
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:25,796
All l can tell you is that
each time he’s fed upon...

257
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:28,242
... his chances of survival
diminish severely.

258
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:33,156
Dr. Weir, we’ve got a match.
We went through the database.

259
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,760
Between our list and Ladon’s...

260
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,487
... there’s only one potential location
that makes sense.

261
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:39,239
Go.

262
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,482
All right, let’s do this one
by the numbers.

263
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:48,797
We get in. We get our man.
We get out.

264
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,923
Stay sharp and stay alive.

265
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:53,282
What are you on about ?

266
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:56,086
Oh, things that Sheppard would say,
so l thought l would--

267
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:59,523
- Well said, Rodney.
- Just stay behind me.

268
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:01,360
Right.

269
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:05,321
Just bring him back.

270
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:14,117
l thought you said
this wasn’t personal.

271
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:16,517
The truth is,
l would’ve settled for Dr. McKay.

272
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:19,764
But l don’t imagine l would enjoy
his constant wailing.

273
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:21,958
They’re never gonna make
the trade, Kolya.

274
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:23,719
Why don’t you just finish this ?

275
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:27,323
l think you underestimate
the sympathetic nature of Dr. Weir.

276
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:29,836
Well, then you underestimate
Élizabeth.

277
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:33,437
You’d prefer l stormed Atlantis
and take Ladon by force ?

278
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:36,956
What do you got ?

279
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:42,076
Half a dozen men and a starving Wraith ?
Yeah, you go right ahead.

280
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:44,124
One way or the other, Ladon is mine.

281
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:47,000
Protecting him is a waste of my time
and your life.

282
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:48,686
What’d he do to you ?

283
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:53,764
l was the one planning
to overthrow Cowen.

284
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:57,086
Ladon disclosed those plans,
forcing me underground...

285
00:17:57,287 --> 00:17:59,596
... then staged a coup of his own.

286
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,684
He took what was rightfully mine.

287
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:04,886
Bring in the Wraith.

288
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:25,599
Go on, go on.

289
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:32,006
Spread out.

290
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:51,486
It’s just the caretaker.

291
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:06,761
Rodney.

292
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:10,243
l saw something out of the corner
of my eye. You know, l reacted.

293
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:11,436
What is it ?

294
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:16,886
A mouse. A really big one, though.
More of a rat, really. Possibly rabid.

295
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:19,521
- This isn’t the place, is it ?
- l do not believe so.

296
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:21,757
No. Sheppard wasn’t here.

297
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:24,117
And we’ve just wasted two
and a half hours.

298
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,199
- Let’s move out.
- And a mouse.

299
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:29,839
Your intel was wrong.

300
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:33,439
Then the only way for me to help
is to return to my homeworld...

301
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,643
... and mobilize the resources
of my military.

302
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:37,166
Contact them from here.

303
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:39,921
Do you think l don’t know
the reason you’re keeping me ?

304
00:19:40,087 --> 00:19:42,965
You are a head of state.
It was John Sheppard’s last order...

305
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:45,118
... that we do not submit
to Kolya’s demands.

306
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:48,199
It is my own country’s policy
to never yield to terrorists.

307
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:51,086
Those are the reasons
you’re still here, Mr. Radim.

308
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:53,556
Because believe me,
if it was simply my choice--

309
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,876
- l understand.
- Good.

310
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:56,480
- How-- ?
- We don’t have much time.

311
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:59,480
l want you to look over our list
and see if there’s anything--

312
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:01,160
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation.</i>

313
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:07,124
It looks to be another video feed.

314
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:09,721
Patch it through and open a channel.

315
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,320
<i>Dr. Weir, as promised.</i>

316
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:16,436
Where’s Sheppard ?

317
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:20,885
<i>I’m pleased to see you’re wasting</i>
<i>no time. So neither will I.</i>

318
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:37,079
<i>Will you turn Ladon Radim</i>
<i>over to me...</i>

319
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,965
<i>... in exchange for Colonel Sheppard ?</i>

320
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:42,246
<i>Dr. Weir ?</i>

321
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:44,486
No.

322
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:48,326
<i>I can only conclude you doubt</i>
<i>my sincerity.</i>

323
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:07,966
Enough.

324
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:20,801
<i>Three hours.</i>

325
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:44,240
Where are your friends ?

326
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:48,363
- They’Il be here.
- You still believe that ?

327
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:50,518
Yeah, l do.

328
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:52,759
They just need more time.

329
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,527
No one has ever left this place alive.

330
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:57,803
Yeah, well, l’m going to.

331
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:02,438
Kolya will kill you before your friends
have a chance to reach these cells.

332
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:07,203
How well do you know
the layout of this place ?

333
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,325
Well enough to know
what they would be up against.

334
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:22,360
What about us ?

335
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:26,480
Do you know enough about
this place to get us out ?

336
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:28,795
You and me ?

337
00:22:29,407 --> 00:22:31,602
Why, are they gonna let you go
after l’m dead ?

338
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:34,562
- No.
- Then what have you got to lose ?

339
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:36,876
My life.

340
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:39,521
Oh, yeah, you’ve got a great one
down here.

341
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:42,365
Listen...

342
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:45,282
... it makes sense.

343
00:22:45,727 --> 00:22:47,797
We have a common goal.

344
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:51,239
As l said before...

345
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:54,638
... there is no escape.

346
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:04,726
Move.

347
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:28,606
<i>He still has years ahead</i>
<i>of him, Dr. Weir.</i>

348
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,446
- <i>my offer stands.</i>
- So does my answer.

349
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:34,923
<i>Then you’re effectively</i>
<i>ending his life.</i>

350
00:23:35,887 --> 00:23:37,206
l’m not gonna go there.

351
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:39,922
<i>Is Ladon there ?</i>

352
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:42,402
l am.

353
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:44,080
<i>I wonder what you’ve told them...</i>

354
00:23:44,247 --> 00:23:46,397
<i>... so they’d choose you over</i>
<i>one of their own.</i>

355
00:23:46,607 --> 00:23:48,086
That l betrayed you.

356
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:50,807
That l took for myself
what you believed to be yours.

357
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:52,725
<i>The truth ?</i>

358
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:55,357
<i>I must say I’m surprised.</i>

359
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,556
If you release him...

360
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,480
... you may return to our people
with my promise of amnesty.

361
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:01,882
<i>Please, Ladon,</i>
<i>I’ve trained you better than that.</i>

362
00:24:02,047 --> 00:24:04,686
<i>There are things that cannot</i>
<i>be undone.</i>

363
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:06,838
That’s not true.
You can end this.

364
00:24:07,007 --> 00:24:10,522
<i>Strange, doctor, I was just about</i>
<i>to say the same thing.</i>

365
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:14,915
Take your fill.

366
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:32,161
Who told you to stop ?

367
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,963
He is near death.

368
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,518
Shall l finish him ?

369
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:43,086
Get it out of here.

370
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:51,605
<i>Now it’s two hours.</i>

371
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:57,077
If he’s fed upon again,
he’s as good as dead.

372
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,841
- We don’t know that.
- Aye, Rodney, we do.

373
00:25:00,007 --> 00:25:02,965
He may already be past the point
of no return.

374
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:06,637
We know that a large percentage of
those that survive a partial feeding...

375
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:08,604
... die anyway...

376
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:11,759
... due to complications
as a result of strain on the system.

377
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:15,161
What appears as physical aging
is actually a byproduct...

378
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:18,637
... of a complex process
we barely understand.

379
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:24,240
l can’t imagine him surviving
another session...

380
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:26,682
... whether it’s two hours
or 10 hours from now.

381
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:29,196
If you were half the man
Sheppard is...

382
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:32,040
... you’d volunteer
to make the trade yourself.

383
00:25:32,807 --> 00:25:36,163
The truth is, l’m not sure whether
or not l would have made the trade...

384
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,124
... if our roles were reversed.

385
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:43,282
So l ask you, allow what you have
done for me to be worth something.

386
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:46,605
There is nothing more l can do here.

387
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:49,884
But l can get the information
to find Sheppard if you allow me...

388
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:53,642
... to return and interrogate the men
who stole the codes from me.

389
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:21,675
You know, l could’ve sworn
l was gonna wake up dead today.

390
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:24,283
You are strong.

391
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:28,203
Stronger than any human
l have ever fed upon.

392
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:33,286
- You stopped yourself.
- Yes.

393
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:35,116
Why ?

394
00:26:35,287 --> 00:26:39,838
Because the longer l feed,
the weaker you become.

395
00:26:40,407 --> 00:26:43,558
And we will need
what strength you have left...

396
00:26:44,127 --> 00:26:45,321
... to escape.

397
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:50,280
Now he wants to escape.

398
00:26:54,687 --> 00:26:57,485
l lack the words to thank you,
Dr. Weir.

399
00:26:58,007 --> 00:26:59,963
l didn’t do this for you.

400
00:27:00,127 --> 00:27:02,118
Well, nevertheless...

401
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:05,924
... l’Il be in touch the moment l have
the information that you need.

402
00:27:06,087 --> 00:27:07,281
Thank you.

403
00:27:09,607 --> 00:27:12,804
Why do l have the sinking feeling
we’ve just made a terrible mistake ?

404
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:14,480
Because we have.

405
00:27:14,647 --> 00:27:16,922
l’m not so sure, Ronon.

406
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:06,999
Which way ?

407
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:09,882
This way.

408
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:49,723
It will heal.

409
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:52,717
This way.

410
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:12,838
They did this together.

411
00:30:13,007 --> 00:30:15,123
They’ve taken weapons.

412
00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:18,322
l want 10 armed men
at the stargate.

413
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:20,796
The rest of you, hunt them down.

414
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:46,166
- How far is the stargate ?
- It will be guarded.

415
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:49,046
- We’ve got guns.
- They will be waiting for us.

416
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:51,243
Don’t be so negative.

417
00:30:53,207 --> 00:30:55,562
Do you think you’re gonna make it ?

418
00:30:55,727 --> 00:30:57,160
If l feed.

419
00:30:57,367 --> 00:30:59,517
Well, don’t look at me.

420
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:09,322
We make it to the stargate,
we both go our separate ways.

421
00:31:09,487 --> 00:31:11,284
Until then...

422
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:13,597
... we’re gonna need each other.
Deal ?

423
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,359
Dr. Weir ?

424
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:41,719
How long has it been ?

425
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:43,445
It’s coming up on two hours.

426
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:46,246
We should receive the next
transmission any minute now.

427
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:48,836
Yes, l’Il be there in a moment.

428
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:55,039
l was blindfolded all the way
to the bunker. It wasn’t this far.

429
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:57,198
If l could just move faster.

430
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,998
We’Il rest here a few minutes.

431
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:04,839
You should go on without me.

432
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,645
No.

433
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,958
The gate’s guarded.

434
00:32:09,607 --> 00:32:13,441
Got a better chance of taking
out the guards in a crossfire.

435
00:32:14,607 --> 00:32:17,917
- l still need you.
- Very well.

436
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:22,117
That is, even if we’re going
in the right direction.

437
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:31,277
You have no idea
where the stargate is, do you ?

438
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:35,877
It was many years ago.

439
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,045
Way to go, John.
Listen to a Wraith.

440
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,677
It was not my intention
to deceive you, Sheppard.

441
00:32:44,207 --> 00:32:47,279
<i>Our reinforcements have arrived</i>
<i>at the stargate, commander.</i>

442
00:32:47,447 --> 00:32:50,883
<i>Kill the Wraith on sight,</i>
<i>but I want Sheppard alive.</i>

443
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:52,639
Well...

444
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:54,924
... we learned two things :

445
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:56,679
One...

446
00:32:56,847 --> 00:32:58,280
... he likes me better than you.

447
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:04,284
Two, we probably never would’ve
made it to the stargate anyway.

448
00:33:05,327 --> 00:33:08,239
- Then it is over.
- No.

449
00:33:08,407 --> 00:33:10,557
Our people don’t leave
each other behind.

450
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:14,083
- That’s three things you’ve learned.
- You still believe that ?

451
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:17,279
Kolya doesn’t know where we are.

452
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,922
He’s wasting manpower...

453
00:33:20,127 --> 00:33:23,164
... that could be used searching
for us, guarding the gate.

454
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:27,115
The odds of my people finding us
are going up and up.

455
00:33:27,287 --> 00:33:31,041
You are more like Wraith
than you know.

456
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:33,721
l’m not sure l like the sound of that.

457
00:33:33,927 --> 00:33:39,684
There is much about a Wraith
that you do not know, Sheppard.

458
00:33:43,447 --> 00:33:45,039
- Kolya’s late.
- That is not like him.

459
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:47,277
We haven’t heard anything
from Ladon either.

460
00:33:47,447 --> 00:33:48,596
We will.

461
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:52,680
- Is it possible they were in on this ?
- No. l don’t think so.

462
00:33:52,887 --> 00:33:55,037
Why would Ladon come here
in the first place ?

463
00:33:55,247 --> 00:33:56,282
Throw us off the scent.

464
00:33:56,447 --> 00:33:59,007
- What kind of a plan would that be ?
- Genii.

465
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:00,156
True.

466
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:03,439
Either way, there must be a reason
why Kolya has not contacted us.

467
00:34:03,647 --> 00:34:06,639
Perhaps he knew it would take
Col. Sheppard more time to recover.

468
00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:10,561
None of us are saying what
we’re all thinking here.

469
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:11,842
No, Rodney, we’re not.

470
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,117
<i>Tell Kolya there’s nobody around</i>
<i>the gate.</i>

471
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:21,324
Sounds like they’re concentrating
their search around the gate.

472
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:25,356
They must think we knew
where we were going.

473
00:34:27,847 --> 00:34:30,441
Oh, it was worth it...

474
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:32,797
... if only to see the sky again.

475
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:35,885
l got slightly higher expectations.

476
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:38,476
My wound is deep.

477
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:41,607
If l do not feed soon...

478
00:34:43,127 --> 00:34:44,719
... l will die.

479
00:34:44,927 --> 00:34:47,885
Buck up. We got a deal, remember ?

480
00:34:48,727 --> 00:34:52,242
We both go home alive.

481
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:54,923
And if we were...

482
00:34:55,647 --> 00:34:58,320
... to meet again in the future ?

483
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:00,959
What then ?

484
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:06,525
All bets are off.

485
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:15,165
Then let us hope
we do not meet again.

486
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:18,245
Try to get some sleep.
l’Il take the first watch.

487
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,606
l’m receiving the new Genii IDC
along with a video feed.

488
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:28,440
- Ladon.
- Put it on the screen.

489
00:35:31,447 --> 00:35:33,119
<i>Are you receiving me ?</i>

490
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:34,766
We were starting to get worried.

491
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:37,316
<i>Yes, I’m sure you had doubts...</i>

492
00:35:37,487 --> 00:35:40,479
<i>... but the truth is, the interrogation</i>
<i>took longer than I hoped.</i>

493
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:42,763
<i>We’ve secured the location</i>
<i>of Kolya’s base.</i>

494
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:45,043
<i>I’m forwarding you</i>
<i>the dialing coordinates now.</i>

495
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:46,322
Are you certain ?

496
00:35:46,487 --> 00:35:49,206
<i>Certain enough to send</i>
<i>a full brigade through the gate.</i>

497
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:51,597
<i>It will take us an hour</i>
<i>to marshal our forces.</i>

498
00:35:51,807 --> 00:35:54,799
<i>-I thought you might want that time.</i>
- What will we be up against ?

499
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:58,164
<i>Nothing one of your Jumpers and</i>
<i>my friend Ronon couldn’t handle.</i>

500
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:03,084
<i>I ask only that you leave Kolya</i>
<i>for my own forces to find.</i>

501
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:07,521
No promises.

502
00:36:08,327 --> 00:36:10,124
<i>I understand.</i>

503
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:13,157
Get a cloaked Jumper
and a team of Marines.

504
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:16,319
l’d like to reserve one seat
for a member of my medical team.

505
00:36:16,527 --> 00:36:18,916
Done. And if you do find Kolya--

506
00:36:19,127 --> 00:36:20,606
No promises.

507
00:36:20,807 --> 00:36:22,320
Exactly.

508
00:36:50,647 --> 00:36:52,046
They’re coming.

509
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:42,565
The facility is straight ahead.

510
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,719
We’re detecting life signs on
the surface, miles from the bunker.

511
00:37:45,887 --> 00:37:47,923
- How many ?
- When it first came, it was eight.

512
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:50,521
Then four. l don’t get it,
now it’s just the two.

513
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,718
- What’s going on ?
- One of them is Sheppard.

514
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:54,923
His transmitter is still broadcasting.

515
00:37:55,127 --> 00:37:57,357
- Could the other one be Kolya ?
- Let’s hope so.

516
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,957
Land 100 meters
to the south of their position.

517
00:38:13,927 --> 00:38:15,804
Finish it.

518
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:20,040
As l told you, John Sheppard...

519
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:25,440
... there are many things about Wraith
that you do not know.

520
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:43,518
Wait !

521
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,398
Leave him.

522
00:38:47,567 --> 00:38:49,478
That’s an order.

523
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:51,757
l don’t understand.
We saw what he did to you.

524
00:38:51,967 --> 00:38:53,844
He just undid it.

525
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,046
Lower your weapons.

526
00:38:57,687 --> 00:39:01,521
- How is this possible ?
- Don’t ask me.

527
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:04,684
The gift of life...

528
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:09,079
... is reserved only
for our most devout worshipers...

529
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:11,761
... and our brothers.

530
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:16,720
Well, l guess there’s a lot
about the Wraith we don’t know.

531
00:39:16,927 --> 00:39:19,316
Sheppard gave me back my life.

532
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:21,443
l merely repaid the debt.

533
00:39:21,887 --> 00:39:24,845
What debt ? Are you kidding ?
He looks younger than he did before.

534
00:39:25,047 --> 00:39:27,322
What about Kolya ?

535
00:39:31,127 --> 00:39:33,687
Kolya, this is Sheppard.

536
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:37,598
Kolya. l figured you’d run.

537
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:41,362
<i>Next time,</i>
<i>I kill you on sight, do you hear me ?</i>

538
00:39:46,607 --> 00:39:48,325
Let’s get off this rock.

539
00:39:49,247 --> 00:39:50,999
What about him ?

540
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:54,595
We had a deal, right ?

541
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:58,921
l did not truly expect you
to honor it.

542
00:40:12,607 --> 00:40:15,405
- You didn’t kill him.
- No, l didn’t.

543
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:18,479
Get him in the Jumper. We’re gonna
drop him off somewhere.

544
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:24,323
Thanks for showing up.

545
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:33,759
Sheppard. l thought you--

546
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:35,883
There’s a lot you don’t know
about humans.

547
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:43,167
l see.

548
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:48,681
Next time we meet ?

549
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:52,403
All bets are off.
