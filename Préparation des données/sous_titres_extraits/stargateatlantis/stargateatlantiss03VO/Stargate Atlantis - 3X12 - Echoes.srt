00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:53,246
Most of the crew was killed...

505
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:56,240
... the pilot opened up a hyperspace
window as they were hit.

506
00:30:56,447 --> 00:30:59,041
He flew the ship here, jumping
ahead of the radiation...

507
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:00,242
... to warn everyone.

508
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:04,446
They raised the shield, extended it to
protect a large portion of the planet.

509
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:06,763
What ?
This is going to happen soon ?

510
00:31:06,927 --> 00:31:10,476
Not soon. It’s happening right now.

511
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,685
How are you doing ?

512
00:31:24,607 --> 00:31:26,723
l have felt better.

513
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:30,004
- You need any more pain medicine ?
- No.

514
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:33,482
It does not seem to help anymore.

515
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:36,923
Well, just hang on.
You’re gonna be fine.

516
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,360
Teyla, look at me.

517
00:31:40,527 --> 00:31:41,801
Look at me.

518
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,844
You gotta hold on.

519
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:47,642
You gotta teach me
those meditation lessons.

520
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:52,044
You are hopeless.

521
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:55,284
Yeah, l know.

522
00:31:59,527 --> 00:32:01,085
Teyla.

523
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:03,925
Nurse.

524
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:09,962
McKAY : The magnetic field
is already beginning to weaken.

525
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:13,642
When that prominence collapses,
the coronal mass ejection will occur.

526
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:17,277
It’Il erupt from a very small area,
a mere pinprick in comparison...

527
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:21,042
... to the total sun surface, but
it’Il immediately begin to fan out.

528
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:23,841
Within a few million miles,
the blast will cut a swath...

529
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:25,759
... wide enough to take out
this planet.

530
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:26,916
How much time ?

531
00:32:27,087 --> 00:32:30,523
It will collapse any moment. Less
than an hour before radiation hits.

532
00:32:30,727 --> 00:32:33,321
- Why didn’t we notice this ?
McKAY : These things happen quickly.

533
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:36,285
This kind of sunspot cycle is chaotic,
impossible to predict.

534
00:32:36,447 --> 00:32:39,166
That caused the glitch
in the Jumper’s navigational system.

535
00:32:39,327 --> 00:32:42,444
Not to mention our focus was on
attack from the Wraith, not the sun.

536
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:44,438
The whales were aware
this was happening ?

537
00:32:44,607 --> 00:32:46,757
- A lot of animals : whales, dolphins--
- Pigeons.

538
00:32:46,927 --> 00:32:49,157
- -are affected by anomalies
in the magnetosphere.

539
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:51,716
It’s as if their internal compasses
are somehow--

540
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,923
Pigeons ?

541
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:57,479
Yeah, homing pigeons. Yes, l used
to raise them before coming here.

542
00:32:57,647 --> 00:33:00,002
We’d consult solar charts
before our pigeon races.

543
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:01,964
- Pigeon races.
- Rodney.

544
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:04,921
It’s still a mystery
how they sense this trouble...

545
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:06,600
... but they do well before we do.

546
00:33:06,807 --> 00:33:07,842
What are our options ?

547
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:10,157
Raise the shield,
stretch it wide enough...

548
00:33:10,327 --> 00:33:12,283
... to protect a portion of the planet.

549
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:16,725
Attenuated, more of a thin bubble,
it was able to block enough radiation.

550
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:18,878
We have found evidence
of mass extinction...

551
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:22,084
- ... on other parts of the planet.
- Wow. Now we know what caused it.

552
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:24,807
Okay, so our shield is already
activated. What else ?

553
00:33:25,007 --> 00:33:28,522
Small problem. The Ancients
had three ZPMs at their disposal.

554
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:30,678
We, as you know, only have one.

555
00:33:30,847 --> 00:33:33,042
Maybe l was insistent on keeping
them because...

556
00:33:33,207 --> 00:33:35,880
... l, too, am able to sense
trouble on the horizon.

557
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:37,202
Just like a pigeon.

558
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:40,479
So we just need to get the other
two ZPMs back here temporarily.

559
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:43,525
The <i>Odyssey’s</i> away. In the time
it would take them to return...

560
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:45,200
... the blast wave would hit us.

561
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:47,477
How far can we extend
the shield with one ZPM ?

562
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:51,043
Enough to cover the city and perhaps
a bit of the ocean surrounding it.

563
00:33:51,247 --> 00:33:53,715
- We should evacuate.
McKAY : We can’t gate to Earth.

564
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:55,918
We need the ZPM’s power
for the shield.

565
00:33:56,487 --> 00:33:58,796
- The intergalactic bridge ?
- Midway isn’t completed.

566
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:01,686
We’d need to ferry people
by Jumper. Again, no time.

567
00:34:01,847 --> 00:34:05,044
We’Il send everyone to the Alpha
site, pick them up when it’s over.

568
00:34:05,207 --> 00:34:06,560
l don’t think you understand.

569
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:09,839
Look, the shield will protect the
city from the initial blast, yes.

570
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:13,204
The entire ecosystem of this planet
will be damaged beyond recovery...

571
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:14,561
... for hundreds of years.

572
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:17,845
We’re talking no plant life,
which means no breathable air.

573
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:29,765
SHEPPARD :
Beckett.

574
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:31,242
Élizabeth.

575
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:34,806
Damn it.

576
00:34:42,287 --> 00:34:45,836
Sergeant Bale. Developed an aneurysm
from the pressure. First fatality.

577
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:56,364
- How is she ?
- Out of time.

578
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,597
l guess we all are.

579
00:34:59,007 --> 00:34:59,996
Sheppard.

580
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:03,915
You got a plan ?

581
00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:07,485
Sure.

582
00:35:10,927 --> 00:35:14,442
ZELENKA : Look at them seeking shelter
underneath the umbrella of the city.

583
00:35:15,207 --> 00:35:17,402
No. We don’t have nearly
enough power.

584
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:20,559
We can extend the shield 20
kilometers beyond the city, maybe.

585
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:23,161
There’s no way of knowing
whether we can sustain it...

586
00:35:23,327 --> 00:35:25,238
... under a radiation blast
of 50,000 rem.

587
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:27,125
Colonel Caldwell, this is Sheppard.

588
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:29,922
- Go ahead, Colonel.
<i>-I think we have a plan.</i>

589
00:35:30,887 --> 00:35:31,922
We do ?

590
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:34,722
McKAY : This is not a good plan.
SHEPPARD : Sure it is.

591
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:36,838
You realize how close
we’Il get to the sun ?

592
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:38,201
Pretty damn close.

593
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:41,086
- Suicidally close. We’Il be toast.
- We’re taking the ZPM...

594
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:43,602
... to give the <i>Daedalus’</i> shield
an extra boost.

595
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:47,282
Okay, you want to deflect the coronal
mass ejection away from the planet.

596
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:50,556
- Like an umbrella.
- Okay, listen to me.

597
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:54,118
This, this is the sun.
And this, this is us.

598
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:57,799
A bolt of energy unlike anything
you can possibly comprehend...

599
00:35:57,967 --> 00:36:01,004
... is gonna shoot out of the
photosphere at a tremendous velocity.

600
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:04,125
Okay ? It is going to immediately
start fanning out, like so.

601
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:06,158
- l know.
- Which means we’Il have to be...

602
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:10,400
... really close to the sun if we wanna
intercept that stream and deflect it...

603
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:12,956
- ... before it can start spreading out.
- l know.

604
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:16,039
l don’t think you do. l don’t think
you grasp the reality...

605
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,926
... of just how damn hot it gets
that close the sun.

606
00:36:19,127 --> 00:36:21,595
We’re taking the ZPM,
to strengthen the shields.

607
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:24,924
From the blast wave, yes, even
with the shields at that strength...

608
00:36:25,087 --> 00:36:27,317
... the buildup of residual heat
could cause...

609
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:28,920
... problems for the <i>Daedalus</i>...

610
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,965
- ... and everyone inside it.
- Could. Could cause.

611
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,805
Okay, tell me.

612
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:36,686
If this is such a great plan,
why didn’t the Ancients do it ?

613
00:36:36,847 --> 00:36:37,962
They were in a war.

614
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:40,322
They probably didn’t have
a ship at the time...

615
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:43,445
... and like you said,
they had three ZPMs.

616
00:36:43,647 --> 00:36:45,524
ZELENKA [ON RADIO] : <i>Rodney.</i>
- What ?

617
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:47,564
<i>The prominence</i>
<i>has begun collapsing.</i>

618
00:36:48,927 --> 00:36:51,236
Colonel Caldwell, we’re ready.

619
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:03,204
SHEPPARD : <i>How’s it going, Rodney ?</i>
- You know, this might look easy...

620
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:07,286
... but it’s actually more complicated
than just flipping a switch.

621
00:37:07,927 --> 00:37:10,043
Hurry up, please. We’re there.

622
00:37:10,247 --> 00:37:11,600
What ? We are ? Already ?

623
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:13,644
CALDWELL :
<i>Didn’t have far to go.</i>

624
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:21,805
In position, doctor. Shields are up.

625
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:23,958
We need that extra power
from the ZPM now.

626
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:27,079
Yes, yes, l just need to--

627
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:30,205
Oh, no.

628
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:32,326
What ?

629
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:35,803
The prominence is collapsing into
the photosphere. Brace yourselves.

630
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:44,516
SHEPPARD :
Rodney.

631
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:47,966
The ZPM is online.

632
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:05,880
How long will this last, doctor ?

633
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:08,521
Anywhere from a few seconds
to several hours.

634
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:11,360
Hours ? You never said
anything about hours.

635
00:38:11,527 --> 00:38:13,563
We’re building up heat
behind the shield.

636
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:15,917
l told you this wasn’t a good plan.

637
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:18,525
DEX :
How are they doing ?

638
00:38:18,727 --> 00:38:21,719
According to my calculations,
the blast should have hit by now...

639
00:38:21,887 --> 00:38:24,879
... but l’m reading no discernible
increase in radiation.

640
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:29,323
So they’re doing good.

641
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:32,156
Yes. So far, anyway.

642
00:38:34,807 --> 00:38:36,559
McKAY :
Temperature is rising too fast.

643
00:38:36,767 --> 00:38:39,520
l’m already detecting several
failed sensors on the bow.

644
00:38:39,727 --> 00:38:42,195
If this keeps going,
the heat could damage the hull.

645
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:44,125
Not could. It’s already damaging it.

646
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:45,766
We have a breach at the 302 bay.

647
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:47,366
Seal it off.

648
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:54,475
Another breach, deck four.
We’re venting atmosphere.

649
00:39:11,287 --> 00:39:13,039
Rodney ?

650
00:39:16,047 --> 00:39:17,082
It’s over.

651
00:39:18,407 --> 00:39:20,238
And we’re not toast.

652
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,040
We’re not toast.

653
00:39:23,927 --> 00:39:25,997
Good plan, huh ?

654
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:40,161
ZELENKA :
Most of them are gone now.

655
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:42,676
They began dispersing
almost immediately.

656
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,361
Without so much as a thank you.

657
00:39:45,567 --> 00:39:48,286
[YELLING ]
No, thank you.

658
00:40:07,887 --> 00:40:11,163
- How are you feeling ?
- Much better.

659
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:15,006
Walked the whole way over here,
didn’t see one ghost.

660
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,199
Nor did l.

661
00:40:20,047 --> 00:40:23,483
- Mind if join you ?
- If you fall asleep one more time...

662
00:40:31,447 --> 00:40:33,165
Hit me with that.

663
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:47,722
- They’re gone, Rodney.
- Not all of them. Look.

664
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:53,601
- Let me guess. Your buddy Sam.
- l’d like to think so.

665
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:55,883
l like to think he’s saying goodbye.

666
00:40:56,767 --> 00:41:01,318
Makes sense. He saved your life.
Now you saved his.

667
00:41:01,487 --> 00:41:03,125
You’re even.
