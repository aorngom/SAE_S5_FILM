506
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:58,686
Everyone okay ?

507
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:00,281
So far.

508
00:34:00,447 --> 00:34:01,482
l’Il be fine.

509
00:34:01,927 --> 00:34:03,519
Why aren’t we dead yet ?

510
00:34:03,687 --> 00:34:06,565
Probably saving us for a little
recreational mind probing.

511
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:08,475
Did everyone get the-- ?

512
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,719
- We completed our task.
- So did we, in the nick of time.

513
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:14,077
- You ?
- Yeah, just under the wire.

514
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:25,444
Did you think you’d be able
to stop us ?

515
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:26,636
Of course we did.

516
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:29,839
- Why else would we be here ?
O’NEILL : Colonel.

517
00:34:30,007 --> 00:34:32,123
Am l gonna have to fire you ?

518
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:35,120
No, sir. You’Il have that to look
forward to when we get back.

519
00:34:35,287 --> 00:34:38,836
l’m afraid your plan has been discovered,
Colonel Sheppard. It is over.

520
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:44,605
He put his hand in my forehead.

521
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:45,961
How can you resist that ?

522
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,886
Well, l like to close my eyes
and think of England.

523
00:34:49,447 --> 00:34:51,881
TALUS : Mr. Woolsey informed us
of everything we need to know.

524
00:34:52,047 --> 00:34:55,005
All of your C4 has been removed
from the emitters.

525
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:57,965
l’m afraid they won’t be destroyed
when the <i>Daedalus</i> arrives.

526
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:00,402
Which should be in any moment.

527
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,246
Your plan has failed.

528
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:12,206
Talus, the <i>Daedalus...</i>

529
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,358
<i>-... is approaching the planet.</i>
- As expected.

530
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:17,555
Activate the shield.

531
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:29,126
C4. How much do we have ?

532
00:35:29,287 --> 00:35:31,005
- A bunch, why ?
- Well, it’s desperate.

533
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:32,322
Well, so are we.

534
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:34,279
We’Il need to split into groups.

535
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:36,478
Gonna suggest that.
What are you thinking ?

536
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:40,396
If we’re gonna destroy these guys using
disrupters, we have to hit them at once.

537
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:43,639
We’Il get a dozen or so shots
before they figure out the frequency.

538
00:35:43,847 --> 00:35:45,963
You gonna get them all
to stand in one place ?

539
00:35:46,407 --> 00:35:48,443
Clever, yes, or we could figure out...

540
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:50,996
... a way to send one massive blast
through the city.

541
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:52,921
Look, follow me.

542
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:57,120
Atlantis has 10 of these emitters
with which it creates the city’s shields.

543
00:35:57,327 --> 00:36:01,479
So if we can interface the crystals
from the disrupter weapons...

544
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:04,317
... with those in the shield emitters...

545
00:36:04,487 --> 00:36:07,684
... we should trigger a massive
anti-Replicator wave through the city.

546
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:09,838
That’s where splitting into teams
comes in.

547
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:13,039
Exactly. l need to show you how
to do this, so listen carefully.

548
00:36:13,207 --> 00:36:16,085
Slide out the crystal tray.
Take the crystal from the weapon.

549
00:36:16,247 --> 00:36:20,718
Place it in the third slot. Third symbol
from the left activates the crystal tray.

550
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,559
Clear on that ? Great.

551
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:27,727
They’re bound to find one group
working on the shields.

552
00:36:27,887 --> 00:36:29,798
Thought of that.
That’s what the C4 is for.

553
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:32,322
- We blow them up ?
- No, we feed them misinformation.

554
00:36:32,487 --> 00:36:34,955
All right. Once you guys
made all your alterations...

555
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:40,195
... avoid using your shiny new toys,
even if that means getting caught, okay ?

556
00:36:41,087 --> 00:36:44,159
If we plant charges in the emitters
before the <i>Daedalus</i> arrives...

557
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,363
... when the Replicators
activate the shield--

558
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:49,400
The C4 detonates, the <i>Daedalus</i>
beams a warhead into the city.

559
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:50,881
And we all get vaporized.

560
00:36:51,527 --> 00:36:53,643
That sounds more like a plan F,
doesn’t it ?

561
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:56,361
General O’Neill didn’t buy it,
but l think Woolsey did.

562
00:36:56,527 --> 00:36:59,087
l did win a Sears Drama Festival
award when l was a kid.

563
00:36:59,247 --> 00:37:01,283
Could’ve made it a career
if l wanted to.

564
00:37:01,447 --> 00:37:03,085
Wish you would’ve.

565
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:06,357
- Aah !
- Unh !

566
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:10,277
We need to get to the shield
emitter stations.

567
00:37:10,447 --> 00:37:12,517
Remove the C4 explosive
you find there.

568
00:37:13,047 --> 00:37:15,117
Way to resist.

569
00:37:15,327 --> 00:37:17,238
l said l wasn’t good at this.

570
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:19,606
Talus, the <i>Daedalus</i>...

571
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:21,798
<i>-... is approaching the planet.</i>
- As expected.

572
00:37:23,527 --> 00:37:24,755
Activate the shield.

573
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:47,201
Ha ! It worked. l can’t believe it.

574
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:50,558
- Rodney, amazing.
- Well, it was a group effort.

575
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:53,918
Good old plan D, works every time.
You guys stay here a sec.

576
00:37:54,087 --> 00:37:56,237
Excuse me, but what just happened ?

577
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,477
We turned the shield
into a giant weapon.

578
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:01,247
- l knew that.
- You knew ?

579
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:04,962
l’ve seen Carter crack enough codes
to know that McKay was faking.

580
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:06,919
He was ? l bought it completely.

581
00:38:07,127 --> 00:38:08,765
l believe that was the point.

582
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:11,278
Wait a minute. You used me ?

583
00:38:11,727 --> 00:38:13,206
You’re alive and you’re welcome.

584
00:38:13,407 --> 00:38:14,726
Hey. We’re clear.

585
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:17,920
We’ve gotta get to the control room
and contact the <i>Daedalus.</i>

586
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,161
You see, Richard.

587
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:23,642
You were good for something.

588
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:24,876

589

Sir, l have an incoming message
from Atlantis.

590
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,921
Atlantis. Is it Replicators ?

591
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:41,443
No, sir. It has Colonel Sheppard’s
authentication code.

592
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:43,438
Open a channel.

593
00:38:43,607 --> 00:38:46,405
- Colonel, l’d like to believe this is you.
SHEPPARD : <i>Well, it is</i>.

594
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:49,001
<i>Authentication code</i>
<i>alpha-delta charlie-niner-six.</i>

595
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:51,203
That code is no longer valid, colonel.

596
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:54,046
Hey, Caldwell.
General Jack O’Neill here.

597
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:55,885
That valid enough for you ?

598
00:38:57,847 --> 00:38:59,838
You may have been compromised, sir.

599
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:04,001
We’re lowering
the city’s shield, Steven.

600
00:39:05,127 --> 00:39:09,006
Send a team to come check us out
if you need to. We’Il explain everything.

601
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:13,286
Get a team of Marines
ready to beam down.

602
00:39:13,447 --> 00:39:16,166
This should be
an interesting explanation.

603
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:31,324
O’NEILL :
Getting all settled in ?

604
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:34,285
Easily. Although their decorating ?

605
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:39,237
A little bit Spartan for my liking.
But the Replicators did do a fine job...

606
00:39:39,407 --> 00:39:42,319
... on rebuilding stargate operations
back to its original state.

607
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:45,566
How about yourself ?
Do you check out okay ?

608
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:49,555
Apparently, l don’t have any little
tiny robots floating in my bloodstream...

609
00:39:49,727 --> 00:39:51,843
... which is always nice to hear.

610
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:54,522
Hm. That it is.

611
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:56,596
So, what now ?

612
00:39:56,807 --> 00:40:00,482
Oh, a Jumper ride home to the SGC,
followed by a hot shower...

613
00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:04,481
- ... followed by a hot toddy--
- l was thinking a little more selfishly.

614
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:08,406
What are the chances of my team
staying here in Atlantis ?

615
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,526
Uh...

616
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:13,838
- Élizabeth, if it were up to me--
- It is up to you.

617
00:40:14,607 --> 00:40:16,120
Right.

618
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:18,002
You can stay.

619
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:20,196
Really ?

620
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:22,801
You’re gonna have to get
the stamp from the l. O.A.

621
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:24,719
But since you saved
Woolsey’s ass...

622
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:26,878
... and you did a fair job on mine...

623
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:29,197
... l don’t think that’Il be a problem.

624
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:33,360
Well, l think l speak for all of us
when l say thank you very much.

625
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:35,159
Hey, you came back to rescue me.
