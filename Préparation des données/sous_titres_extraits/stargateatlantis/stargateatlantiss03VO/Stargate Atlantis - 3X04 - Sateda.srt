0
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:14,686
Something wrong ?

1
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:17,407
- l have a bad feeling.
- Yeah, l always feel like that.

2
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:19,523
Like something horrible
is about to happen.

3
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,279
- How do you live ?
- l get used to it.

4
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:25,645
Thing is, when someone else
also has that feeling, mine gets worse.

5
00:00:25,847 --> 00:00:27,758
You recognize this place ?

6
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:28,956
l don’t remember.

7
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:32,079
You must have visited many planets
when running from the Wraith.

8
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:33,845
l didn’t count.

9
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:37,276
l don’t know how
you tell them apart.

10
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:41,486
See ? Here you go.
Nothing to worry about.

11
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:46,363
Seems like a perfectly nice village to me,
just like dozens of others we’ve visited.

12
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:49,639
It appears to be the type
my people trade with all the time.

13
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:52,680
l see no evidence
of threatening behavior or danger.

14
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:56,436
l also see nothing we might be interested
in trading for.

15
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:03,637
Hi. How you doing ?

16
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:05,202
Wraithbringer.

17
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,795
Wraithbringer !

18
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:11,401
- That can’t be good.
- You don’t have to be afraid.

19
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:14,445
- Where are they going ?
- We need to get out of here now.

20
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:16,884
l take it he was talking to you ?

21
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,200
That did not just happen.

22
00:01:21,407 --> 00:01:23,363
Warning fire only.

23
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:26,516
Go.

24
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:30,923
Oh, my God, it hurts.
l can’t feel my leg.

25
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:33,641
- Is it pain or numbness ?
- Both.

26
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:39,765
- What did you do to these people ?
- Don’t listen to him.

27
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,958
How could he not recognize
the gate address ?

28
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:44,761
Do you know the symbols
of every address of every planet ?

29
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:46,918
Yes, as a matter of fact.

30
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,920
Go. Get to the gate.

31
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:03,318
Go on. We’Il be right behind you.

32
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:29,126
Damn it.

33
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:45,718
Oh, crap.

34
00:02:57,087 --> 00:03:00,602
Rodney. Medical team to the gate room.

35
00:03:01,487 --> 00:03:02,761
Rodney ?

36
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:04,161
Hey, where are the others ?

37
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,244
They’re right behind me.

38
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:23,442
Well...

39
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:27,079
... l guess it could be worse.

40
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:32,446
Look, l know you must be thinking
this is your fault.

41
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:37,440
l have already tried to console him.

42
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:45,163
We were bound to run across
a planet you’d been to sooner or later.

43
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:51,683
It was night last time.

44
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:04,240
Linor.

45
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:06,358
- Stay away.
- It’s a man, Father.

46
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,282
He’s near death.

47
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:10,921
You think we would not
remember you ?

48
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,035
We offered you food and shelter.

49
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,280
Thank you.

50
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:33,241
Maybe you did not
remember our village.

51
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:36,086
We were forced to rebuild
after the Wraith came.

52
00:05:49,487 --> 00:05:51,284
Linor. No.

53
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:58,247
They were not merely culling us
as they had in the past.

54
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:00,403
They were looking for you.

55
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:03,804
- l’m sorry.
- Sorry ?

56
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,800
l doubt that.

57
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:09,563
You will not bring death
and destruction on us again.

58
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:11,166
Look...

59
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:13,562
... l can’t say the Wraith
won’t be back again.

60
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:16,201
But l promise you
they’re not coming because of him.

61
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:19,524
No. Not once we’ve sacrificed
the Wraithbringer...

62
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:20,876
... to his masters.

63
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:22,361
He prefers Ronon.

64
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:25,286
Probably also prefers
not to be sacrificed to the Wraith.

65
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:27,603
He is a victim of the Wraith...

66
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:29,923
... like all of us.
His planet was destroyed.

67
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:32,960
He was captured and made a runner,
but he is not one anymore.

68
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,158
They cannot track him
as they once did.

69
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:37,756
They did not feed on us all last time.

70
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,800
They promised that if he ever
came back and we captured him...

71
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:43,965
... we would be forever free
from culling in the future.

72
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:46,123
They promised ?

73
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:48,959
They are Wraith.

74
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:52,159
l promise you that killing Ronon
will not change what happened.

75
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:56,002
- And it will not protect you in the future.
- l said nothing of killing.

76
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,084
Isn’t that what » sacrifice » means ?

77
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:01,563
l know not what his masters
will do to him once we turn him over.

78
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:04,123
You’re giving him to the Wraith ?

79
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:07,364
They left this behind
so that we could call them.

80
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:09,966
He has already activated it.

81
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:13,239
They’re gonna kill all of us,
you included.

82
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:24,957
So many colors.

83
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:27,362
All the pretty horses.

84
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:29,364
What’s he talking about ?

85
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,717
l gave him some morphine
for the pain.

86
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,923
l need to know how many villagers.

87
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:37,800
How far is the gate from the village ?

88
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:41,120
Have you seen a guy around ?

89
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,364
He looks like you
but he’s got messy hair.

90
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:47,401
l think l lost him somewhere.

91
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:50,599
And a pretty girl and a caveman.

92
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:52,479
l may have given him
a bit too much.

93
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:55,155
But he was making it impossible
for me to treat him.

94
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:57,366
Snap out of it, McKay.

95
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:59,080
It’s important.

96
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,683
Come on. What kind
of weapons did they have ?

97
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:04,156
Something that shoots arrows
is a good guess.

98
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:06,887
Excuse me ? Why am l lying here ?

99
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,318
You have an arrow, Rodney,
in your gluteus maximus.

100
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:14,200
Well, that sounds painful.

101
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,122
Gluteus maximus.

102
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:19,082
Gluteus...

103
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:21,517
... maximus.

104
00:08:21,727 --> 00:08:24,480
Oh, my God.
That’s my ass, isn’t it ?

105
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:28,236
Call me if he makes any sense.

106
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:30,438
Get him back here.

107
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:32,726
The leader of your village.

108
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,566
Why ?

109
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:36,605
Because l need to talk to him.

110
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,164
It’s too late for you.

111
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:40,959
The Wraith will be here soon.

112
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,005
Shoot me with one of those darts...

113
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:49,801
... and l promise he’Il be dead
before l go down.

114
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:50,996
Let him go.

115
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:53,323
Hey, buddy, you wanna fill me in
on this plan ?

116
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:55,995
- Let him go now.
- Get Keturah.

117
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:57,242
l’m here.

118
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:59,041
Unhand him now.

119
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,399
l will not free you.

120
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,601
These men will kill your friends first.

121
00:09:04,807 --> 00:09:07,526
l don’t think that’Il be necessary.

122
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:10,719
Why don’t we all put our weapons down
and talk about this nicely ?

123
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:13,919
Let them go.
It’s me the Wraith want.

124
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,998
They had nothing to do
with what happened.

125
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:17,646
Ronon.

126
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:20,436
Don’t.

127
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:21,875
They won’t shoot me.

128
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:25,161
They must know the Wraith
still want me alive.

129
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,120
l was a little more worried
about them shooting us.

130
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:31,676
Please, Keturah.

131
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:34,036
Let him go now.

132
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:42,363
- What the hell are you doing ?
- Back off, Sheppard.

133
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,159
Drop the knife now.

134
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,800
No.

135
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:49,844
l didn’t mean to bring the Wraith here,
but it was my fault.

136
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,958
- That isn’t true.
- You know it is.

137
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:55,283
l should never have come here.

138
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:57,957
l should never have stayed.

139
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:02,080
l’m sorry about what happened
to your village.

140
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:05,924
But if you think turning me over
to the Wraith will keep you safe...

141
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,317
... fine. Do it.

142
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:11,166
l’Il do whatever l have to
to make up for what happened.

143
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:13,403
But don’t punish them
for my mistake.

144
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:19,804
They’re good people.

145
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,797
You let them go or l’Il be dead
before the Wraith get here.

146
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:25,918
l promise.

147
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:31,486
Then see what the Wraith do to you.

148
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:36,563
We’re not leaving. Not without you.

149
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:38,166
You let them go.

150
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:41,797
We have no issue with the other two.

151
00:10:48,807 --> 00:10:49,956
Let them go.

152
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:55,565
Resist and you will be killed.

153
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:10,601
Incoming wormhole.

154
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:20,238
It’s Colonel Sheppard’s IDC, ma’am.

155
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,403
Lower the shield.

156
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:26,959
Someone get us
some vests and guns.

157
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:28,242
- Colonel, Teyla.
- Major.

158
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,682
We were about to come get you guys.
Where’s Ronon ?

159
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:33,725
- Still back there. Did McKay get through ?
- He’s gonna be fine.

160
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:35,923
- What happened ?
- Ronon bargained our freedom.

161
00:11:36,087 --> 00:11:38,726
By sticking a knife to his own throat.
We’re going back.

162
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:41,560
- Dial the gate.
- Took us 15 minutes to get to the gate.

163
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:43,524
Place could be crawling
with Wraith now.

164
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:45,200
Let’s go get him.

165
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,483
Couldn’t have been gone
more than a half-hour.

166
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:27,524
It doesn’t take long.

167
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:32,961
All right, everybody, fan out.

168
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:47,602
As we suspected,
the deal did not go as planned.

169
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:55,518
There’s a few dozen bodies here
at most.

170
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:57,206
The rest were culled.

171
00:12:57,407 --> 00:12:59,159
We found these.

172
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:05,398
We’Il find him.

173
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:21,640
l once fed from the humans
of your homeworld.

174
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:24,884
That is where l will watch you die.

175
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,325
All right, boys, let’s go.

176
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:47,438
Move, move, move.

177
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:44,642
He’s alive.

178
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:47,202
l hope he is,
but how can you be certain ?

179
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:49,642
They made a sport
out of trying to kill him.

180
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:52,367
- He was the one that got away.
- They will try again.

181
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:54,677
Ronon will not go down easily.

182
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,764
They must know
how dangerous he can be.

183
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:59,236
It’s not like they’re gonna
give him a fair chance.

184
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:01,165
Obviously, we don’t have much time.

185
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:03,081
How do we find him ?

186
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:06,085
If the Wraith put a tracking device in him
like last time...

187
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:07,441
Can you pick up a signal ?

188
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,484
Of course. If it sounds like it
might be impossible, you look at me.

189
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:13,444
We have the device
we took out of him.

190
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:15,882
We might be able to tune the sensors
to pick up...

191
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:18,242
- ... similar subspace transmissions.
- Good.

192
00:15:18,407 --> 00:15:21,205
But we are still assuming
that the Wraith put another in him.

193
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:23,398
l’Il take whatever odds l can get.

194
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:38,726
Ronon.

195
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,716
McKay ?

196
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:06,679
l’m here.

197
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:11,476
You know, you really don’t appreciate
the simple things in life...

198
00:17:11,687 --> 00:17:12,961
... like sitting.

199
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:14,646
l don’t envy you.

200
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:16,565
It must be a real pain in the ass.

201
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:19,600
- How long did you work on that ?
- Longer than l care to admit.

202
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:21,962
- How’s it coming ?
- l think l’m almost there.

203
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,761
- Is this thing active ?
- Don’t worry. l limited the power.

204
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:26,440
It won’t transmit to the Wraith.

205
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:28,717
l just needed enough juice
to determine...

206
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:31,122
... the subspace frequency
it broadcasts on.

207
00:17:31,287 --> 00:17:35,405
And now l need to recalibrate the city’s
long-range sensors to pick up on it.

208
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:38,440
These sensors only cover
a small corner of the galaxy.

209
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:41,963
They’re calibrated to pick up a signal
being transmitted using subspace.

210
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:46,120
l’Il leave the bad jokes to you and you
leave the brilliant science stuff to me.

211
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:47,999
So, what are we looking at ?

212
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:50,917
These dots represent
transmitters broadcasting...

213
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:53,402
... from various locations
in the Pegasus galaxy.

214
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:56,445
So there are seven runners
out there right now ?

215
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:58,524
We don’t know for sure
they’re runners.

216
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:01,685
But l’Il bet anything,
that one’s Ronon.

217
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:04,117
- Why ? How do you know ?
- That’s Sateda.

218
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:07,319
It’s Ronon’s home planet.

219
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,725
That’s a good enough place to start.

220
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,236
We have no choice.

221
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:38,836
We’ve been unable to dial in
to Sateda’s stargate.

222
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:42,158
- The Wraith likely disabled it.
- If the Wraith are hunting Ronon...

223
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:44,477
... there’s a chance
there’s a hive in orbit.

224
00:18:44,647 --> 00:18:48,162
l needn’t remind you the <i>Daedelus</i> has
not done well with Wraith hive ships.

225
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,885
We drop out of hyperspace.

226
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,566
We beam him onboard, we get out.

227
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:53,683
You know we can’t
come out of hyperspace...

228
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:57,522
... close enough to beam someone
off the surface. We’Il be detected.

229
00:18:57,967 --> 00:18:59,116
Look...

230
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:01,798
... you know l wanna help.

231
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:05,880
But l will not put my crew and the only
ship that we have at risk for one man.

232
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:08,436
One man who isn’t a member
of the U.S. military.

233
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,286
- l didn’t say that.
- He’s a member of my team...

234
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,275
... and he deserves the same respect
as anyone on this expedition.

235
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,923
We don’t leave our people out there,
colonel. Not if there’s any chance.

236
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:22,005
Don’t preach to me
about leaving people behind, Dr. Weir.

237
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:30,043
l’m just saying
it’s a very bad risk-reward situation.

238
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:32,606
Fine.

239
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:35,920
Get us close. We’Il take a
cloaked Jumper the rest of the way.

240
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:39,563
l’Il go with them, remove the tracking
device before we get back onboard.

241
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:41,758
We’Il be out
before the Wraith even know.

242
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:43,923
l won’t bail you out
if you get in trouble.

243
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:46,800
You say that as if
we’re always getting in trouble.

244
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:41,156
l’m out of ammo.

245
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,198
There’s a depot
two blocks down. Go.

246
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:42,236
<i>You’re gonna have to do</i>
<i>better than that.</i>

247
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:04,918
<i>Sateda will not bow to invaders.</i>

248
00:22:05,127 --> 00:22:09,405
<i>The time has come for us</i>
<i>to put our bravery on the line...</i>

249
00:22:09,647 --> 00:22:12,161
<i>... and defend our nation, our planet.</i>

250
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:13,766
What are you doing ?

251
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:17,838
l’m listening to
the Chieftain’s speech.

252
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:19,925
Why aren’t you packing ?

253
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:24,083
l traded every last thing we had
to get you on Kell’s personal staff.

254
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:27,723
He’s a criminal. He’s using
people’s fear for his own gain.

255
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:30,447
He’s a commander.
His staff gets to go through the gate.

256
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,246
The hospital’s gonna need me.

257
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:35,362
There’s not gonna be a need
for hospitals, Melena.

258
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:37,399
That’s just a bunch of words...

259
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,326
... meant to make the people
who don’t get to leave...

260
00:22:41,007 --> 00:22:43,123
... think there’s a chance for them.

261
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:45,761
We shot down two ships
that came through the gate.

262
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:48,845
Two small ships.

263
00:22:49,047 --> 00:22:51,515
Do you really think
that’s all they’re gonna send ?

264
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:53,720
Of course not.

265
00:22:53,927 --> 00:22:56,600
Ships as big as our city
have attacked other planets.

266
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,322
No one that stays here
is going to survive.

267
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:03,845
Then why are you staying ?

268
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:07,275
- l have no choice.
- Yes, you do.

269
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:09,525
You believe in this fight.

270
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:12,685
You know that they’Il eventually find us
no matter where we go.

271
00:23:12,887 --> 00:23:16,243
Our only hope is to show them
that we’re not worth the effort.

272
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:20,042
To go feed on some other planet
that won’t fight back as hard as we will.

273
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,676
Ronon.

274
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:24,719
You can’t run forever.

275
00:25:48,207 --> 00:25:49,640
Hey.

276
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,400
Am l disturbing you ?

277
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,120
No.

278
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:55,040
What’s up ?

279
00:25:56,447 --> 00:25:58,244
l just wanted to thank you.

280
00:25:58,447 --> 00:25:59,926
For what ?

281
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:02,482
For going after Ronon this way.

282
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:05,080
Did you think we wouldn’t ?

283
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:08,761
He is an outsider.

284
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,364
Not to me.

285
00:26:13,527 --> 00:26:16,678
l have often felt like an outsider
among your people.

286
00:26:17,407 --> 00:26:20,080
Well, maybe at first, but...

287
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,965
You know l’ve always trusted you.

288
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:27,844
Yes. You and Dr. Weir
have been very accepting...

289
00:26:28,247 --> 00:26:30,442
... but this has shown me
how far you would go...

290
00:26:30,647 --> 00:26:33,445
... even for someone
who is not from your world.

291
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:43,278
Look, Teyla,
l’m not really good at...

292
00:26:43,887 --> 00:26:48,642
Actually, l’m terrible at expressing...

293
00:26:48,847 --> 00:26:50,724
... l don’t know what you’d call it.

294
00:26:51,407 --> 00:26:52,396
Feelings ?

295
00:26:53,527 --> 00:26:54,960
Yeah, sure, okay.

296
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,405
The point is,
l don’t really have good...

297
00:26:58,607 --> 00:27:00,199
Social skills.

298
00:27:01,447 --> 00:27:06,202
That is why l enjoyed flying choppers
in the most remote part of my world...

299
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:09,877
... before all this craziness happened.
But you should know...

300
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,078
... l don’t have...

301
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:14,446
Friends ?

302
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,606
No. l have friends.

303
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,801
You, Élizabeth...

304
00:27:24,647 --> 00:27:30,085
... Ronon, Carson, even Rodney,
are the closest thing l have to a...

305
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:31,766
A family ?

306
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:34,763
l’d do anything...

307
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,040
... for any one of you.

308
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,723
If l had to give up my life
the way Ronon was going to...

309
00:27:46,287 --> 00:27:47,720
... l would.

310
00:27:57,767 --> 00:27:59,359
Thank you.

311
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:03,565
For everything you meant to say.

312
00:28:35,607 --> 00:28:37,086
Son of a-- You’re killing me.

313
00:28:37,287 --> 00:28:40,643
l’m not even touching you. l’ve never
treated a bigger baby in my life.

314
00:28:40,847 --> 00:28:45,557
- Just-- Are we done ?
- Yes. It looks fine, considering.

315
00:28:50,447 --> 00:28:52,438
- Why did you come ?
- What do you mean ?

316
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,639
On this mission. You’re injured.
You can’t even sit down.

317
00:28:56,407 --> 00:28:59,126
- People won’t think less of you.
- You think l care about...

318
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:01,164
- ... what people think of me ?
- Actually--

319
00:29:01,327 --> 00:29:03,158
Hey, l am a very caring person.

320
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:07,607
Okay, maybe it’s not always
obvious to everyone but...

321
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:11,396
- You care about what happens to Ronon ?
- l do. What makes you think l wouldn’t ?

322
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:14,883
Oh, l don’t know. You refer to him as
« the caveman « behind his back.

323
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:16,196
That is a nickname.

324
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:18,523
Buddies have nicknames
for each other.

325
00:29:18,727 --> 00:29:20,558
Buddies ? Oh, you’re buddies now,
are you ?

326
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:23,002
Yeah. He saved my life.
He’s like a brother to me.

327
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:26,686
A brother who got every gene
you didn’t and vice versa.

328
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:28,878
You are just jealous
of our relationship.

329
00:29:29,087 --> 00:29:30,759
Am l ?

330
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:32,878
In the year or so he’s been with us...

331
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:35,840
... have you ever had a conversation
with the man ?

332
00:29:37,847 --> 00:29:39,075
We have an unspoken bond.

333
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:41,403
There are things that go
deeper than words...

334
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:45,685
... but you wouldn’t know that because
you never look past the surface, do you ?

335
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:16,280
Melena. Melena.

336
00:30:18,007 --> 00:30:19,201
Melena.

337
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:49,520
Melena.

338
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:53,646
Melena.

339
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:09,958
- Where’s your squad ?
- They’re all dead.

340
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:11,964
Kell used us
to ensure his own escape.

341
00:31:12,127 --> 00:31:14,846
Come on. l can get us out of here.
l can get us to the gate.

342
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:17,601
- If l can’t, l know where to hide.
- Ronon.

343
00:31:23,887 --> 00:31:25,002
What about her ?

344
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:26,686
Her parents are both dead.

345
00:31:27,247 --> 00:31:30,045
Come here. Come on.

346
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:31,720
Ronon, wait.

347
00:31:39,327 --> 00:31:41,238
What about all these people ?

348
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:43,799
They’re all dead.

349
00:31:45,647 --> 00:31:47,080
l can’t.

350
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:49,926
l can’t, Ronon. l can’t go.

351
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,716
<i>You’re a coward.</i>

352
00:32:30,887 --> 00:32:32,525
Don’t look so surprised.

353
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,279
Are you okay ?

354
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:41,244
Come on. You can thank us later.

355
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:44,245
McKay and Beckett are waiting for us
in a Jumper on the roof.

356
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:45,681
Get out of here.

357
00:32:45,887 --> 00:32:48,003
Hey, l know
you’ve been through a lot, but--

358
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,044
l’m not going anywhere.

359
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:58,924
What is going on there ? You have 25
Wraith closing in from ground level.

360
00:32:59,887 --> 00:33:02,276
It seems Ronon
doesn’t want to leave.

361
00:33:02,487 --> 00:33:04,921
Tell that ungrateful example
of unevolved humanity...

362
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:07,555
... that we came all this way
to rescue him, so he’d--

363
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:10,918
McKay says he’s very hurt
you won’t come with us.

364
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:12,242
l can’t.

365
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:14,156
Keturah and his people...

366
00:33:15,207 --> 00:33:16,720
... they had a deal.

367
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:19,043
They traded me for their freedom.

368
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,760
Are you doing this for them ?

369
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:24,198
Those people, the ones on the planet
who turned you over to the Wraith ?

370
00:33:24,407 --> 00:33:25,999
It was my fault they were culled.

371
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:27,720
Ronon...

372
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:30,324
... the Wraith didn’t honor the deal.

373
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:33,200
Keturah and his village,
they’re all dead.

374
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:38,236
Now, can we go ?

375
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,240
No.

376
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:41,676
Why not ?

377
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:44,926
Because l’m gonna kill the Wraith
responsible for all this.

378
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:47,879
l don’t suppose he happens to be...

379
00:33:48,047 --> 00:33:50,356
... one of the ones out there
about to come in here.

380
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:54,164
No. He’s probably still up on the hive.

381
00:33:54,887 --> 00:33:57,082
We can’t take on a hive ship now.

382
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:01,362
You won’t have to.

383
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:06,805
Why aren’t you moving ?

384
00:34:07,007 --> 00:34:09,362
<i>Ronon wants to take care</i>
<i>of a few things first.</i>

385
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:11,683
Oh, really ? Like what ?

386
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:15,839
Come on.

387
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,041
Let’s go kill some Wraith.

388
00:34:25,327 --> 00:34:27,477
Just stay out of my way.

389
00:34:29,207 --> 00:34:30,640
Hey.

390
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:33,724
Thought you might want this.

391
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:39,239
You’re welcome.

392
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:42,118
What the hell is going on down there ?

393
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:45,319
<i>Ronon thinks he can get the head Wraith</i>
<i>to come down and fight...</i>

394
00:34:45,487 --> 00:34:47,921
<i>... if we kill all these Wraith first.</i>

395
00:34:51,287 --> 00:34:53,801
<i>That is the stupidest plan</i>
<i>I have ever heard.</i>

396
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:57,044
l don’t know, killing a bunch of
Wraith seems like a good idea.

397
00:34:57,247 --> 00:34:59,715
<i>They outnumber you 25 to three.</i>

398
00:34:59,927 --> 00:35:03,283
It’s actually 22 to three.
Twenty-one.

399
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:05,523
And Ronon appears to be
quite angry.

400
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,326
That evens it out.
You realize that there’s a hive ship...

401
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:11,121
... capable of blowing us all off
the face of this planet.

402
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:24,203
- Where are you going ?
- l’m going to help.

403
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:27,518
- Are you crazy ? You’re a doctor.
- What does that have to do with it ?

404
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:30,280
- What are you doing ?
- l’m going.

405
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:33,126
- You can barely walk.
- l can walk fine. l just can’t sit.

406
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:35,596
- You’re a terrible shot.
- What, you’re Rambo now ?

407
00:35:39,527 --> 00:35:41,404
Oh, man.

408
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:23,478
There’s more than one gun.
We can both go.

409
00:36:23,687 --> 00:36:28,283
- Someone has to stay with the Jumper.
<i>-That’s it. We got them all. mcKay ?</i>

410
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:32,446
Yeah, it’s just you guys left.

411
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,086
Well, that was quick.

412
00:36:35,047 --> 00:36:37,402
- Yeah, l got six. Teyla got--
- Eight.

413
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:42,159
l got nine, Teyla got eight,
Ronon got the rest.

414
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,118
<i>You wanna watch me die up-close...</i>

415
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:51,319
<i>... you’re just gonna have</i>
<i>to come down here and do it yourself.</i>

416
00:36:52,207 --> 00:36:53,435
<i>You want me ?</i>

417
00:36:55,327 --> 00:36:57,283
<i>Come get me !</i>

418
00:36:57,447 --> 00:36:59,677
<i>I’Il be waiting.</i>

419
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:06,763
You kill him before l do, l kill you.

420
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:08,878
What if he kills you first ?

421
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:10,918
Then you kill him.

422
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:12,561
Got it.

423
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:05,839
l could shoot him right now.

424
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,115
l wouldn’t.

425
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:17,478
You really think Ronon would kill me ?

426
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:19,245
l think he wouldn’t forgive you.

427
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,121
l think he’d get over it.

428
00:38:28,327 --> 00:38:30,795
The hive has got to be watching.

429
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:32,241
We shoot that Wraith...

430
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,718
... they blast us all from space.

431
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,481
If he doesn’t like it, he can sue me.

432
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:19,760
l win.

433
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:48,361
Go.

434
00:40:02,687 --> 00:40:04,723
- Everyone okay ?
- We are okay.

435
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:07,441
Which one of you killed the Wraith ?

436
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:09,758
- That would be me.
- My idea.

437
00:40:12,607 --> 00:40:15,121
- Ronon.
- What ?

438
00:40:15,327 --> 00:40:17,761
Don’t tell me you’re not happy
that he’s dead.

439
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:20,316
l had him,
but Ronon said he’d kill me if l shot him.

440
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:22,205
It was all Beckett’s idea.

441
00:40:25,407 --> 00:40:27,159
Thanks, doc.

442
00:40:28,127 --> 00:40:29,355
What, him you thank ?

443
00:40:30,527 --> 00:40:32,802
l could have killed him
but Teyla wouldn’t let me.

444
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:34,400
Thank you.

445
00:40:34,607 --> 00:40:36,643
- All of you.
- Oh, don’t mention it.

446
00:40:36,847 --> 00:40:39,156
It’s nothing, really.
l only killed 11...

447
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:40,999
... 12 Wraith.

448
00:40:41,207 --> 00:40:43,960
How about l get that tracking device
out and deactivated...

449
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:46,083
... before the hive ship
gets a bead on us ?

450
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:49,637
l take it this time you won’t mind
if l give you a sedative ?

451
00:40:52,087 --> 00:40:53,645
Or not.

452
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,475
Who’s flying the ship ?

453
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:01,242
Me.
