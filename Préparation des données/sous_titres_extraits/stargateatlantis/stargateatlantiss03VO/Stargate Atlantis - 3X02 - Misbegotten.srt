00:00:01,527 --> 00:00:03,040
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis<i> :</i>

1
00:00:03,207 --> 00:00:05,402
Currently, Stargate Command
has no vessels...

2
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:08,440
... capable of engaging the hive ships
before they reach Earth.

3
00:00:08,647 --> 00:00:11,286
Even if we could catch up,
l don’t know how long we’d last.

4
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:16,117
The lingering stench of what they
transformed you into will never fade.

5
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:19,637
Wouldn’t it have been prudent
to send a ZPM to Earth on the <i>Daedalus ?</i>

6
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:21,838
- Colonel Sheppard, is that you ?
- Who’s this ?

7
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:24,402
Targeting the generators
will be most effective.

8
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,518
This ship has been seriously damaged.

9
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:29,321
- It’s hard to find something to overload.
- Let Mikey try.

10
00:00:31,127 --> 00:00:32,116
He’s helping us.

11
00:00:32,327 --> 00:00:35,922
- l’ve just opened fire on the transport.
- Beam them directly to the bridge.

12
00:00:36,087 --> 00:00:38,647
It took out our life support.
Backups aren’t responding.

13
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:41,799
The only breathable air within light-years
is on the Wraith ship.

14
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:44,322
- There’s also Wraith.
- Unless we send over the gas.

15
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:47,445
- We finish the plan we started.
- Start sending people over, sir.

16
00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:49,279
They’re all human, the air is good.

17
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:50,960
l think we’re out of the woods.

18
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:54,557
<i>Incoming wormhole.</i>

19
00:00:56,647 --> 00:00:58,763
Opening the iris.

20
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:02,636
Receiving video transmission.

21
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:06,996
- <i>Stargate Command, this is Atlantis.</i>
- l’m here, Teyla.

22
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:08,959
Any word about our people ?

23
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,727
<i>Unfortunately, no.</i>

24
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:16,602
<i>But the hive ship we have been tracking</i>
<i>is still on course for Atlantis.</i>

25
00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:19,560
- <i>We expect its arrival shortly.</i>
- Activate the cloak.

26
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:22,125
Proceed.

27
00:01:29,407 --> 00:01:31,967
- Cloak is engaged.
- <i>What about our defenses ?</i>

28
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:34,635
All rail gun positions
are manned and operational...

29
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:37,680
... and Dr. Beckett
is in the drone control chair.

30
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:39,920
<i>Patch me through to him.</i>

31
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:42,483
- <i>Carson ?</i>
- Élizabeth ?

32
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:43,716
<i>How are you doing ?</i>

33
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:47,243
- Oh, just peachy, thanks. You ?
- l’m sorry to put you in this position...

34
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,285
... but you’re the only person
besides Sheppard and O’Neill...

35
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:52,881
... who have actually fired
a drone from that chair.

36
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:55,840
They’re the two people
l nearly killed when l did that.

37
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:58,356
- You’Il do fine.
- <i>Is this even necessary ? I mean...</i>

38
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:01,479
... we’ve got the cloak up,
chances are they won’t find us.

39
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:04,241
<i>I would agree with you,</i>
<i>but this ship is moving faster...</i>

40
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:06,756
<i>... than we’ve seen a hive ship move,</i>
<i>which means...</i>

41
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,316
<i>... either it’s a ship</i>
<i>the</i> Daedalus <i>is chasing...</i>

42
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:12,803
... or they shared the information
they stole from us with other Wraith.

43
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,396
Either way, the cloak
might not do us much good.

44
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:17,605
Great.

45
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,518
Hive ship just dropped out
of hyperspace.

46
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:28,200
Dr. Beckett, stand by.

47
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:43,165
<i>-Receiving a signal.</i>
<i>-Atlantis, this is Sheppard. Come in.</i>

48
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:46,245
- John ?
- <i>They made it ?</i>

49
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:50,076
<i>We’re out of food, water, and we haven’t</i>
<i>slept in days, but, yeah, we made it.</i>

50
00:02:50,287 --> 00:02:52,755
<i>So now would not be a good time</i>
<i>to fire on us.</i>

51
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:57,558
After all, wouldn’t wanna damage
your new hive ship.

52
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:12,006
<i>This is</i> Daedalus.
<i>We’re clear.</i>

53
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:16,758
Sorry to sneak up on you, doc.
Subspace communications were down.

54
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:20,164
- l came this close to blasting you.
- You showed remarkable restraint.

55
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,158
Makes me all the more
confident in you.

56
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:25,404
- Next time ? Oh, no, no--
- Oh, yeah, the retrovirus worked great.

57
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,325
Really ? How many are there ?

58
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:33,079
The ship didn’t have a full complement
to begin with, but still, there are a few.

59
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:48,882
This is a few ?

60
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,362
The official count is just under 200.

61
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:54,286
A lot were killed in battle,
a lot more killed each other...

62
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:57,917
... when the gas started changing them.
We should consider ourselves lucky.

63
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:01,199
A hive ship like this
could carry thousands.

64
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,556
Aye.

65
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:05,478
<i>Don’t misunderstand me, Dr. Weir.</i>

66
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:08,997
l’m not here to lecture you on the moral
complexities of your situation.

67
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:12,836
The IOA has no official position
on the matter one way or the other.

68
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:15,316
Because when there’s
a tough decision to be made...

69
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:17,000
... they suddenly have no opinion.

70
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:21,282
The lives of 200 former Wraith are not
high up on their list of priorities.

71
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:23,963
But the way you dealt
with the recent crisis...

72
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:26,880
... and the manner in which
you responded to their authority...

73
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:31,279
And there’s the issue of whether the
intelligence that allowed these hives...

74
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:34,877
... to get as far as they did
was passed to any other Wraith colonies.

75
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:37,317
According to Michael, it was not.

76
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:41,122
l don’t have to tell you that
your willingness to trust this Wraith...

77
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:43,477
... is not going to make
for a strong defense.

78
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:46,641
l didn’t know l was on trial.

79
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,000
Look...

80
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:53,682
... Pegasus is so far away they never
thought the Wraith would be a threat...

81
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:56,919
... to anyone outside the members
of the expedition itself.

82
00:05:57,127 --> 00:05:59,197
It was their objection
to having Atlantis...

83
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:02,757
... under military control that put me
in this position in the first place.

84
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:05,641
Nothing renews your appreciation
for the military...

85
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:09,522
... like the threat of invasion
from life-sucking aliens.

86
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:21,761
Michael ?

87
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:33,480
Even though l saved
Colonel Sheppard’s life...

88
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:37,475
... and helped him stop the hives
from reaching Earth...

89
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:40,077
... you still place me under guard.

90
00:06:40,287 --> 00:06:42,357
You have betrayed
our trust in the past.

91
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,279
Trust ?

92
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:46,199
l was your prisoner then.

93
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:48,439
And despite what l’ve done for you...

94
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:54,165
... here l am once again.

95
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:59,239
l can’t say l’m surprised.

96
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:03,444
l wasn’t welcome among my own kind,
why should l be welcome here ?

97
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,166
What are you talking about ?

98
00:07:07,247 --> 00:07:10,762
She looked at me
as if l was some kind of unclean thing.

99
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:13,162
l may appear as a Wraith again
on the outside...

100
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:15,921
... but as far
as they’re concerned, l’m--

101
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,198
That is why l need your help.

102
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:26,282
- What do you want ?
- l can’t stay here...

103
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,921
... and l can’t return to the Wraith...

104
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:32,124
... which means l need to make
my own way...

105
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:34,321
... and to do that...

106
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:44,122
... l need supplies and a ship.

107
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:49,402
We are grateful for your help,
but we can never release you...

108
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:53,236
- ... not with the information you possess.
- Then kill me now.

109
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,926
There is another way.

110
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:59,923
- Take the treatment again ?
- Yes.

111
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:04,279
What l am is not a disease
you can cure.

112
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:07,047
Your life as a human
could be long and full.

113
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:11,843
And if l remember
nothing of what or who l am...

114
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:16,758
... if this consciousness is erased...

115
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:19,917
... what is the difference
between that and death ?

116
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:25,398
And if l do remember
and revert back to my true nature...

117
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,040
... what will happen then ?

118
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:32,881
Dr. Beckett has made
significant advances.

119
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:34,805
The treatments
are more effective now.

120
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:37,162
Eventually, he may find
a permanent solution.

121
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:40,480
If you really believed that...

122
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:45,602
... those Wraith you transformed
wouldn’t be in stasis on the ship.

123
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:49,043
They’d be here...

124
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:52,444
... reveling in your hospitality.

125
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:05,361
Come in.

126
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:07,239
Dr. Weir ?

127
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:09,764
Mr. Woolsey.

128
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:13,523
The IOA has decided that,
for the time being...

129
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,764
... you should continue to head
the Atlantis expedition.

130
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:19,358
You’re surprised ?

131
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:22,436
Yes, l am.

132
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:25,878
l guess this means that international
mistrust of the U.S. military...

133
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:30,638
... is far more powerful
than their fear of life-sucking aliens.

134
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:34,163
The truth is, the delegates are split.

135
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:37,962
In order to avoid a deadlock, they
decided on a temporary reinstatement...

136
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:42,957
... pending a detailed report
on the situation in Pegasus.

137
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,125
- Written by ?
- Me.

138
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,242
l’Il be going back
to Atlantis with you.

139
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:52,157
Have you ever been
off-world before, Mr. Woolsey ?

140
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:54,801
Sure. Once.

141
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:58,124
- And how did that go for you ?
- l was nearly killed.

142
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:02,602
Well, we will do our best to make sure
that doesn’t happen this time.

143
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:09,241
Stargate Command has put in a request
to the Asgard for transportation ?

144
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:11,443
They don’t have
a lot of ships to spare...

145
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:15,284
... but that will shave almost two weeks
off our travel time.

146
00:10:16,727 --> 00:10:18,922
l’ve never met an Asgard.

147
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:23,362
You, l think, will love them.
They got a great sense of humor.

148
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,046
Really ?

149
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:27,195
No.

150
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:40,679
You figure out how to fly this yet ?

151
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:44,163
Yeah. Fly, shimmy, spin like a top.
You didn’t think it’d be hard ?

152
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:46,642
Just proves my confidence in you
wasn’t misplaced.

153
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,680
We can’t get the ship to respond
to anything but the basics.

154
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:51,206
That doesn’t do us much good.

155
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:54,598
Really ? Look, all the more
sophisticated systems, like navigation...

156
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:58,077
... respond to Wraith neural interface,
in the same way Puddle Jumpers...

157
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:00,596
... can only be controlled by people
with ATA genes.

158
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:04,601
- So we still need a Wraith to fly it.
- l’m working on a manual override.

159
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,362
Just haven’t had much luck yet.

160
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,083
What about Teyla ? Teyla’s got the
Wraith gene thing. Maybe she can fly it.

161
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:13,676
That’s worth a try,
but that’s not the only problem.

162
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:16,765
At least half of the ship’s
power generating capacity is gone.

163
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,516
Even if l had access to spare parts,
which l don’t, l doubt l could fix it.

164
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:23,525
Now, if we’re gonna fly this thing
and hope for weapons...

165
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:26,287
... we need to cut back
on our current power consumption.

166
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:28,523
- Meaning what ?
- Meaning the 200 prisoners...

167
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,520
... we’ve got in stasis,
we can’t keep them in there forever.

168
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:42,200
- Are you my executioner ?
- l wish.

169
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:53,839
l’m just glad
he’s not gonna remember this.

170
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:06,001
All right, this is weird.

171
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:10,325
- Why ? It’s just a bunch of guys.
- l know what they really are.

172
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:13,686
Keep that to yourself
and try to act normal.

173
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:17,723
Colonel Sheppard,
l need to speak with you.

174
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:19,201
l’m sorry...

175
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:22,683
Oh, my name is Lathan.
At least that’s what l’ve been told.

176
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:25,276
- Okay.
- Many of us have questions, colonel.

177
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:27,398
Like how long
we’re going to be kept here.

178
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:30,519
- That’s up to Dr. Beckett.
- He said he doesn’t know.

179
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:32,957
Which means he doesn’t know
the exact date.

180
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:36,762
Sorry, this is a medical situation,
and he has medical reasons.

181
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:39,197
You people are under quarantine.

182
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:40,601
Why only the men ?

183
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:44,482
Your women are immune to the strain,
so are most of my people.

184
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:46,678
- We’ve been over this a few times.
- l know--

185
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:51,517
Until Dr. Beckett can clear you,
there’s nothing l can do.

186
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:06,962
- How’s it coming ?
- l’m gonna need more time.

187
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:10,477
You’d be better off conducting
this research back on Atlantis.

188
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:13,440
And what, just leave them here ?

189
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:16,320
That was the plan,
you remember that, Carson ?

190
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:17,721
But they’re not ready yet.

191
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:20,964
You were supposed to teach them
to administer the drug themselves.

192
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,283
l have trained several to act
as my assistants.

193
00:13:23,447 --> 00:13:24,960
Then there should be no problem.

194
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:29,801
There’s more here to what l’m doing
than just sticking needles in their arms.

195
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:32,686
For one, l have to make sure
there’s no signs of reversion.

196
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:35,361
This planet has no gate.
They’ve got no way off.

197
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:37,085
Whatever happens, we’re covered.

198
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:40,199
- That’s not what l meant.
- Have any of them started to remember ?

199
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:44,161
l don’t think so. The drug keeps them
stable as long as they get a daily dose.

200
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:47,763
We don’t have the manpower
or the resources to babysit them forever.

201
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:51,084
If l can’t come up with a solution,
we’Il have to abandon them ?

202
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:53,357
- Eventually.
- Then what ?

203
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:55,199
They’Il turn back into the Wraith...

204
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:59,036
... and without any other food supply,
they’Il start feeding on each other.

205
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:01,238
Well, l’m not ready
to give up just yet.

206
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,046
And like it or not,
for the moment, they are human...

207
00:14:04,207 --> 00:14:05,720
... and they’re my responsibility.

208
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,436
- l’Il stay until the first resupply mission.
- That won’t be for another week.

209
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:13,037
They’Il bring enough food to last them
until they can harvest their own.

210
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:15,522
l’Il be perfectly safe.

211
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:20,242
We’re leaving a security team
with you.

212
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,246
What did he say ?

213
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:43,644
Nothing. He won’t tell us anything.

214
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:45,923
He’s hiding something.

215
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:48,235
Like what ?

216
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:50,438
l only know
that something’s not right.

217
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:53,157
Everything they’ve told us
about our homeworld...

218
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:56,325
... the plague, how they rescued us...

219
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:58,518
... l don’t remember a single part.

220
00:14:59,647 --> 00:15:01,956
Because memory loss
is one of the symptoms.

221
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:04,518
How do you know that’s true ?

222
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:06,763
We don’t know them.

223
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:08,923
We don’t even know ourselves.

224
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:11,596
They’re helping us.

225
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:14,275
By keeping us trapped here
with barely enough food...

226
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:17,320
... and no idea when
or if we’Il ever be allowed to leave ?

227
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:19,165
l say that’s not good enough.

228
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:21,601
What are you suggesting ?

229
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:27,723
They only have a handful of soldiers.
We outnumber them 10-to-1.

230
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,397
- And then what ?
- They have some sort of ship.

231
00:15:30,607 --> 00:15:33,280
It’s how we got here.
If we have hostages--

232
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:35,443
What if they’re telling the truth...

233
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:38,241
... and we are really carrying
some kind of deadly plague ?

234
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:42,205
Even if we somehow survive
and get away...

235
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:46,036
... all we’Il be doing is spreading
this disease wherever we go.

236
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,723
Do you really wanna risk that ?

237
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:51,999
If we don’t act before that ship leaves,
we’Il be stranded forever.

238
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:55,404
Michael’s right, Lathan. It’s too risky.

239
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:13,279
Colonel Caldwell ?

240
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:15,519
- Woolsey.
- Mind if l join you ?

241
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:17,365
Of course.

242
00:16:17,607 --> 00:16:20,326
- How are you settling in ?
- l’m not sure about this uniform.

243
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:22,677
You stand out more in a suit and tie.

244
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:26,399
Believe me, l’ve done enough
of these investigations to realize...

245
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:29,599
... that no amount of camouflage
is going to disguise who l am...

246
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:31,035
... or what l’m doing here.

247
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:34,319
Are you expecting
something less than full cooperation ?

248
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:36,803
We’re just having a conversation.

249
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:41,039
As commander of the <i>Daedalus</i>,
l have standing orders to help out...

250
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:46,156
... whenever possible,
but l’m not a member of this expedition.

251
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:48,198
l don’t answer to the IOA...

252
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:52,366
... and unless otherwise
directed by my superiors...

253
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:54,998
... l don’t have to answer
your questions.

254
00:16:58,207 --> 00:17:01,643
The only reason you’re not the
commander of Atlantis is that Dr. Weir...

255
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:04,680
... insisted that post
go to Colonel Sheppard.

256
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:07,003
If she were to leave...

257
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:10,645
... you would be the most likely
candidate to take over.

258
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:13,035
That’s not why you’re here.

259
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:16,441
The IOA doesn’t really want
militarization.

260
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:19,400
They’re just afraid they may have
no other choice.

261
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:24,007
l think you’ve already spoken
to Dr. Weir.

262
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:25,686
No.

263
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:29,006
l’ve just been around long enough
to know what’s going on.

264
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:34,404
It sounds like you’re saying
you won’t come out against Dr. Weir...

265
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:37,440
... only because you’re not confident
of the outcome.

266
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:41,120
No, what l’m saying, Mr. Woolsey...

267
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,197
... is have a pleasant evening.

268
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,598
You guys head back to the ship.

269
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:52,966
Okay, doc, last chance.
We’re packed up and ready to roll.

270
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,442
Colonel, we’ve got a problem.
Lathan’s missing.

271
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:59,037
He didn’t turn up for his last treatment
and nobody’s seen him. Have they ?

272
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:01,442
No, but...

273
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,399
But what ?

274
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:06,561
It’s all right, Michael.
Tell him what you told me.

275
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:09,680
Lathan’s convinced
this is some kind of elaborate lie.

276
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:12,003
l told him you were doing
your best to help us.

277
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:16,445
That maybe the sickness was playing
with his mind, but he wouldn’t listen.

278
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,725
- You’re saying he’s not lost, he’s hiding.
- It’s possible.

279
00:18:19,927 --> 00:18:22,043
It’s best if we find him
as soon as possible...

280
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:24,437
... before any symptoms
of the plague reoccur.

281
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:29,239
- Okay, let’s get a search party going.
- We’d like to help.

282
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,960
He is one of us.

283
00:18:43,927 --> 00:18:46,646
- Anything ?
- Nothing.

284
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:47,882
Morrison, report.

285
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:50,885
<i>We’re just coming up on the river.</i>
<i>Still no sign of him, sir.</i>

286
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,078
All right, keep me posted.

287
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:09,486
Michael.

288
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:12,324
Lathan.

289
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,358
What are you doing out here ?

290
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,001
- l’m proving a point.
- You missed a treatment.

291
00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:19,801
l know, but l’m starting to remember.

292
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:22,640
It’s just flashes, images in my head...

293
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:25,526
... but something’s
definitely coming back to me.

294
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:27,126
Don’t you see what this means ?

295
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:29,636
They’re not curing us,
they’re keeping us this way.

296
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:32,277
We must make our move, and quickly.

297
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:37,323
l’m sorry, but you should have stayed
at the camp.

298
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,921
- <i>Colonel Sheppard.</i>
- Go ahead.

299
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:48,719
<i>We found him, sir.</i>

300
00:19:48,927 --> 00:19:49,996
What’s your location ?

301
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:53,440
We’re halfway up the ridge
that runs south of the camp.

302
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:56,161
He must have been climbing down
and lost his footing.

303
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,125
Are you saying he’s injured ?

304
00:19:58,567 --> 00:19:59,966
No, sir.

305
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:01,839
He’s dead.

306
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:20,926
l’ve prepared the injections
for this morning’s first group.

307
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:22,560
On you go.

308
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:28,762
You’Il be fine.
l’ve seen you do it a dozen times.

309
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:30,685
Besides, l’ve got work to do here.

310
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:33,117
You’re going to examine the body ?

311
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:36,598
The cause of death is quite obvious.
His neck was broken.

312
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:39,600
But there are tests l can perform
that could help my research.

313
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:42,361
At least that way
something good might come of this.

314
00:20:55,727 --> 00:21:00,039
We’ve all logged more than a few miles
these past few weeks.

315
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:03,519
l’d just like to say that seeing you now,
sitting across from me...

316
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,122
... looking at your faces...

317
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:13,077
... it makes me feel very...

318
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,320
You don’t have to say it.

319
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,678
- We feel the same way you do.
- Oh, she feels hungry too ?

320
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,080
Now, Teyla, l understand
navigating the hive ship...

321
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:28,960
... wasn’t a particularly
pleasant experience.

322
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:32,682
The neural interface
was quite exhausting.

323
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:36,243
That was just flying straight.
She’Il never pull off anything complex...

324
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:38,756
... like combat maneuverability,
weapons control...

325
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:40,923
How many maneuvers
can you pull off ?

326
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:44,318
Well, does standing still
count as a maneuver ?

327
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:46,045
No.

328
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:51,005
Sorry l’m late. My interviews
are running a little longer than expected.

329
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:53,678
And you are. . ?

330
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:57,438
Richard Woolsey. He is chief liaison
to the international committee...

331
00:21:57,647 --> 00:21:59,478
... that oversees
the Atlantis expedition.

332
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:02,645
He will be conducting
individual interviews with each of you.

333
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:06,556
As well as observing
all senior staff meetings.

334
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,120
Right.

335
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,761
So, what did l miss ?

336
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:14,596
Rodney was about to run down the
progress made adapting the hive controls.

337
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:16,206
Excellent. Please continue.

338
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:19,920
Thanks.

339
00:22:31,607 --> 00:22:35,236
<i>Dr. Beckett, this is Lieutenant morrison.</i>
<i>What’s your location ?</i>

340
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:37,563
l’m on the ridge
where Lathan’s body was found.

341
00:22:37,927 --> 00:22:40,361
If you don’t mind my asking,
what are you doing there ?

342
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:43,839
l wanted to check on something.
l think we may have a problem.

343
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:45,925
What kind of problem ?

344
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:50,837
<i>I was so caught up running tests on</i>
<i>Lathan’s tissues, I almost didn’t notice.</i>

345
00:22:51,047 --> 00:22:52,082
Notice what ?

346
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:54,244
There isn’t enough blood on the ground.

347
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,477
Meaning his heart
wasn’t pumping when he fell.

348
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:59,083
<i>He definitely died</i>
<i>when his neck was snapped...</i>

349
00:22:59,287 --> 00:23:02,120
<i>... but I think the rest of his injuries</i>
<i>occurred postmortem...</i>

350
00:23:02,727 --> 00:23:04,957
... presumably to make it
look like an accident.

351
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,445
Look, it’s gonna be dark soon.

352
00:23:08,647 --> 00:23:11,719
You’d better start back now.
We’Il talk about it when you get here.

353
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:13,406
All right.

354
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:28,839
It would appear from this incident
that the lies you’re telling these people...

355
00:23:29,047 --> 00:23:31,277
... are beginning to wear a bit thin.

356
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:34,567
One adverse reaction out of 200.

357
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:36,280
Do you hold out much hope...

358
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:39,684
... for the long-term success
of this little science project ?

359
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:41,639
That’s not what this is.

360
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:46,477
You may have never set out to create
this community, but you did create it.

361
00:23:47,207 --> 00:23:51,325
We did what we had to do
in order to survive.

362
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:54,166
l’m sure it seemed like a good idea
at the time.

363
00:23:56,167 --> 00:24:00,524
Even if Dr. Beckett comes up with what
appears to be a long-term solution...

364
00:24:01,287 --> 00:24:04,199
... would we ever trust them enough
to integrate them into any...

365
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:06,323
... society of humans ?

366
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:10,476
- Probably not.
- Which brings me to my first question.

367
00:24:10,647 --> 00:24:11,796
What do you want me
to say ?

368
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:15,164
l supported Élizabeth’s decision
to form an alliance with Michael...

369
00:24:15,327 --> 00:24:20,481
... and l supported her decision
to put all those people on the planet.

370
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:25,204
That support hardly shines through
when you hesitate to call them people.

371
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:07,166
Out of curiosity, how much trouble
is it gonna cause you...

372
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,278
... if l knock this Woolsey guy
in the head ?

373
00:25:09,487 --> 00:25:12,320
- May l ask why you’d like to do that ?
- Just an impulse l had.

374
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:15,087
One l suspect l’m gonna have again
next time l see him.

375
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:17,118
He may not even have
to say anything.

376
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,605
l’ve never seen you like this.
What did Woolsey say to you ?

377
00:25:21,207 --> 00:25:23,767
Besides judging every damn decision
you’ve ever made ?

378
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:27,400
John Sheppard,
are you defending my honor ?

379
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:31,525
And judging me for agreeing with you.

380
00:25:32,727 --> 00:25:33,876
Don’t be too hard on him.

381
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:38,444
l think, of all the circling wolves,
he’s the least likely to actually bite.

382
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:41,605
In fact, he might even convince
the others to leave us alone.

383
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:45,157
All right, so...

384
00:25:46,207 --> 00:25:48,118
... no head-knocking.

385
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:51,921
It’s the thought that counts.

386
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:18,687
Lieutenant Morrison,
this is Dr. Beckett. Come in.

387
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:21,919
Morrison.

388
00:26:24,647 --> 00:26:28,276
l’m afraid the lieutenant and his men
are indisposed.

389
00:26:31,087 --> 00:26:34,204
Listen to me. You’re sick.
You need to take your medication now.

390
00:26:34,407 --> 00:26:36,398
It’s too late for that, doctor.

391
00:26:36,607 --> 00:26:39,883
l’ve regained enough memory to know
you’ve done this to me not once...

392
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:41,805
... but twice.

393
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:45,642
You witnessed how hurt,
how betrayed l felt the first time.

394
00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:49,120
Well, try to imagine how l feel now.

395
00:26:49,327 --> 00:26:52,205
- Why’d you have to kill Lathan ?
- He was stirring up trouble.

396
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:55,763
l knew our only chance was to wait
until Sheppard left with the soldiers.

397
00:26:55,927 --> 00:26:58,725
- Most of them anyway.
- With the ship gone, what’s the point ?

398
00:26:58,887 --> 00:27:01,560
- You’ve got no hope of escape.
- That’s where you’re wrong.

399
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:06,482
What have we got, Rodney ?

400
00:27:06,687 --> 00:27:08,643
Long-range sensors
picked up a hive ship.

401
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:10,075
Coming this way ?

402
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:12,005
No. Wait a minute.

403
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:15,876
- This doesn’t make any sense.
- What ?

404
00:27:17,127 --> 00:27:21,598
It’s headed straight for the planet
where we left Beckett and the prisoners.

405
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:31,919
There’s no reason for the Wraith
to be interested in that planet.

406
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:35,278
No stargate, and no indication
it ever supported a human population.

407
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:37,597
It is completely off the grid.

408
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:40,719
l think we have to consider
the possibility that we have a leak.

409
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:44,317
- You mean a spy ?
- Not necessarily in the city itself.

410
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:47,325
l would begin by focusing
on our contacts...

411
00:27:47,487 --> 00:27:49,876
... within the various
indigenous populations, including--

412
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:53,397
- If you believe any Athosians--
- Let’s not jump to any conclusions here.

413
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:56,764
Isn’t it true there are humans
in this galaxy who serve the Wraith...

414
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:57,956
... even worship them ?

415
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:01,000
How hard would it be
to infiltrate one of our allied groups ?

416
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:04,279
Do you think we post this
information on the city bulletin board ?

417
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:08,162
If the Wraith had that information,
they’d be on their way to Atlantis...

418
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:11,086
... not some nameless planet
with a couple of hundred people.

419
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:14,359
We need to focus on getting
those people out of there.

420
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:17,127
If the Wraith find them
and figure out what they are...

421
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:19,238
We’ve got a problem, again.

422
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,403
- How much time do we have ?
- Two days.

423
00:28:21,607 --> 00:28:24,405
We could... Well, you could
beat them there in the <i>Daedalus</i>.

424
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:28,162
The hyperdrive is still offline.
Hermiod needs at least another 24 hours.

425
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:32,758
- We should light a fire under his bony--
- That still might not be good enough.

426
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:38,203
- If we leave right now in the hive ship. . ?
- We’d be cutting it close.

427
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:42,558
What are our chances of surviving
a ship-to-ship encounter ?

428
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:46,680
If l can get the manual interface
working, l’d say less than slim.

429
00:28:51,447 --> 00:28:52,800
Do what you can on the way.

430
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:08,358
How many have reverted ?

431
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:12,242
Those you saw in the forest,
plus a few more.

432
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:14,278
And the others ?

433
00:29:14,527 --> 00:29:17,963
They’Il serve as an offering to the hive
that’s coming for us.

434
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:22,080
- That’s hardly bloody fair.
- The strong survive, doctor.

435
00:29:23,207 --> 00:29:26,005
The few of us who began to realize
something was wrong...

436
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:28,926
... got together and formed a plan...

437
00:29:29,087 --> 00:29:30,998
... even while on the medication.

438
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:34,561
The weaker minds among us
will stay that way...

439
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:38,721
... thanks to your drugs
and the training you gave us.

440
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:41,646
If your memory’s coming back,
remember what happened...

441
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:43,798
... last time you tried
to rejoin the Wraith.

442
00:29:44,007 --> 00:29:45,838
It will be enough to escape this rock.

443
00:29:46,047 --> 00:29:49,642
What do you need me for ? There must
be a reason you’re keeping me alive.

444
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:52,242
l need to know
what secondary security measures...

445
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:55,598
... Colonel Sheppard
put in place before he left.

446
00:29:58,207 --> 00:30:00,198
What are you talking about ?

447
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:03,207
The more my memory returns,
the more l begin to doubt...

448
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:06,922
... that he would have left us here
without setting up some kind of fail-safe.

449
00:30:07,127 --> 00:30:10,244
There’s no way off this planet.
That was the fail-safe.

450
00:30:10,447 --> 00:30:14,884
How many years will l have to take away
before you tell me what l want to know ?

451
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:19,280
That’s hardly a threat, since you’re
obviously gonna kill me anyway.

452
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:23,236
You underestimate
your own value, doctor.

453
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,519
Look, they don’t tell me
this sort of thing. l’m just a doctor.

454
00:30:28,847 --> 00:30:32,237
Maybe you shouldn’t have been
so quick to kill Lieutenant Morrison.

455
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:38,281
l don’t like to question military men.
They’re like our own Wraith warriors.

456
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:40,239
Unimaginative...

457
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:42,836
... rigid thought patterns.

458
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:46,724
But you, on the other hand...

459
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:50,198
... are trained to have an open mind...

460
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:55,279
... and you have a strong sense
of empathy toward others.

461
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:59,036
It’s not as strong
as it used to be, believe me.

462
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:05,484
You’re exactly what l need.

463
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:08,244
Now...

464
00:31:09,207 --> 00:31:11,163
... let’s begin.

465
00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:34,679
- Do we have weapons yet ?
- Sort of.

466
00:31:34,847 --> 00:31:35,882
What does that mean ?

467
00:31:36,047 --> 00:31:38,277
We can fire,
but not in any particular direction.

468
00:31:38,487 --> 00:31:39,681
You’Il have to do better.

469
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:42,321
No one wants to survive this mission
more than l do.

470
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:44,882
We’re using up a lot of power
to maintain speed.

471
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:48,284
- We’re not gonna have a lot left.
- We’re going fast to avoid fighting.

472
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:50,159
Theoretically.

473
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,517
Just keep working.

474
00:31:58,807 --> 00:32:00,877
<i>Atlantis, this is</i> Daedalus.
<i>We’re ready to go.</i>

475
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:04,363
Are you sure you wanna do this ?
l understand Hermiod isn’t too happy...

476
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:07,127
... about having the hyperdrive
in service so soon.

477
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:11,036
He’s cleared us to fly. Whether or not
he’s happy about it is beside the point.

478
00:32:11,247 --> 00:32:14,000
Anyway, l’m sure Colonel Sheppard
would appreciate the help.

479
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:15,196
<i>Thank you.</i>

480
00:32:15,407 --> 00:32:18,683
- <i>Daedalus</i> out. Set a course.
- Yes, sir.

481
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:37,484
That’s it. We’re out of hyperspace.

482
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:40,280
You all right ?

483
00:32:40,487 --> 00:32:43,081
l believe l have been able to establish
a stable orbit.

484
00:32:43,287 --> 00:32:45,801
All right, nice work.
Any sign of the other hive ship ?

485
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:46,996
No, we’re clear.

486
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:50,517
- All right, patch me through to camp.
- All right, just give me a second.

487
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:54,165
That’s weird.

488
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,799
A bunch of secondary systems
just came online.

489
00:32:58,007 --> 00:32:59,486
You’re a genius, Rodney.

490
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:02,238
True, but l didn’t do it.

491
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,358
It’s like they just woke up
by themselves.

492
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:07,646
They’re keyed into the sensors.

493
00:33:07,807 --> 00:33:11,197
- The ship must have detected something.
- Detected what ?

494
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:15,757
- Wraith life signs.
- From the planet ?

495
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:18,356
- How many ?
- There’s 20 or 30.

496
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:21,081
- What about human ?
- Still well over 100.

497
00:33:21,247 --> 00:33:23,636
- So some reverted.
- They’Il be feeding on each other.

498
00:33:23,807 --> 00:33:25,684
What about Beckett
and Morrison’s team ?

499
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:28,447
l have no way to distinguish them
from other life signs.

500
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:30,444
l can’t say for sure either way.

501
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:36,037
How did they contact
the ship so far out ?

502
00:33:36,207 --> 00:33:38,437
l have no idea.
Teyla, what do you think ?

503
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:43,158
It is possible that a group acting together
could communicate over larger distances.

504
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:44,396
Live and learn.

505
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:48,157
- l’Il live some more, hopefully.
- What about the fail-safe device ?

506
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:52,320
- What kind of kill zone are we looking at ?
<i>-Everything in a three-mile radius is toast.</i>

507
00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:54,284
You sure ?
We’ve got no margin for error.

508
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:56,722
<i>The blast radius</i>
<i>doesn’t just stop at three miles.</i>

509
00:33:56,887 --> 00:33:59,162
What about the ones
that are still human ?

510
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:02,879
There’s nothing we can do for them.

511
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:05,726
Well, l suppose
we could not incinerate them.

512
00:34:06,607 --> 00:34:08,199
If Michael got his memory back...

513
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:11,086
... they could all know about Atlantis
and how to find Earth.

514
00:34:11,287 --> 00:34:12,640
We can’t take that chance.

515
00:34:13,247 --> 00:34:15,807
<i>Once we get our people out,</i>
<i>we’Il give you the signal...</i>

516
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:18,677
... you set off the nuke.

517
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:00,845
Carson.

518
00:35:03,447 --> 00:35:05,483
He’s barely conscious.

519
00:35:06,807 --> 00:35:08,798
- Did you find the others ?
- They were fed on.

520
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:12,198
- There’s not much of them left.
- Help me get him up.

521
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:17,160
Come on.

522
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:19,927
- <i>Rodney, come in.</i>
- What’s happening ?

523
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:23,836
We’ve got Carson. Morrison and his team
are dead. We’re heading back.

524
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:26,802
<i>We’re clear. Light it up.</i>

525
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:28,645
Understood.

526
00:35:31,447 --> 00:35:33,358
Fail-safe detonation in...

527
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:36,161
<i>... three, two...</i>

528
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,005
... one.

529
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,759
Now you see
what they really think of us.

530
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,958
l don’t understand.

531
00:35:46,607 --> 00:35:49,519
The bomb is receiving
a detonation signal.

532
00:35:49,727 --> 00:35:52,195
If l hadn’t deactivated it...

533
00:35:52,647 --> 00:35:54,558
... we’d all be dead.

534
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:57,044
Rodney ?

535
00:35:57,247 --> 00:35:59,238
- l don’t understand it.
- <i>What happened ?</i>

536
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,604
- You mean what didn’t happen.
<i>-You telling me the bomb didn’t go off ?</i>

537
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:03,956
They got to it.

538
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:06,965
We cannot leave the Wraith here
to be found by the hive.

539
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:10,796
Get back to work on those weapons,
Rodney. We’re not going anywhere.

540
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,959
- Should we search for the prisoner ?
- There’s no point.

541
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:27,079
He’s been taken up
to their ship by now.

542
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:29,280
In any case...

543
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:32,601
... he’s served his purpose.

544
00:36:34,687 --> 00:36:39,124
There’s nothing left for us to do but
wait for our brothers to rescue us soon.

545
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:05,644
- How you doing with the weapons ?
- We couldn’t hit the side of a barn.

546
00:37:05,847 --> 00:37:09,920
- Hive ships are a hundred times--
- A giant flying barn, we couldn’t hit that.

547
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:13,085
- What about a stationary target ?
- Motion in space is relative.

548
00:37:13,287 --> 00:37:16,404
- l’m talking about on the planet.
- Well, that l might be able to do.

549
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:18,596
Target the camp.

550
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:21,521
- Wait just a minute.
- We’ve had this discussion before.

551
00:37:21,687 --> 00:37:23,564
- There’s no choice.
- We could go down...

552
00:37:23,727 --> 00:37:25,843
- ... take as many as possible.
- We have no time.

553
00:37:26,007 --> 00:37:30,364
The other hive ship’s gonna be here,
we won’t survive a battle. It’s my call.

554
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:33,599
There’s over 100 men down there
that believe we are their saviors.

555
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:35,803
They’re about to become
casualties of war.

556
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,919
It has to be done.

557
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:45,365
Fire.

558
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,876
It’s the other hive.
We’re taking multiple hits.

559
00:38:02,087 --> 00:38:03,406
- The target ?
- Hard to say...

560
00:38:03,607 --> 00:38:05,518
... how accurate our fire has been.

561
00:38:05,727 --> 00:38:08,799
Blanket the entire area.
We can’t afford a mistake.

562
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,439
Engines are offline. We’re venting
atmosphere. Power’s about to fail.

563
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:30,044
- Report.
- We’ve just about reached the planet.

564
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,997
Drop us out of hyperspace.

565
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:53,115
It’s debris from a hive ship, sir.

566
00:38:53,407 --> 00:38:56,319
- Life signs ?
- No, sir.

567
00:38:57,447 --> 00:38:58,596
What about the planet ?

568
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:00,486
l’m not getting anything.

569
00:39:04,087 --> 00:39:05,725
l see.

570
00:39:06,127 --> 00:39:08,595
Daedalus<i>, this is Sheppard. Come in.</i>

571
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:11,045
Sheppard, where the hell are you ?

572
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:16,517
Oh, right, sorry.

573
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:23,964
We’re picking up a Jumper, sir.
Five life signs.

574
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:27,437
<i>You got here in good time, colonel.</i>
<i>We were looking at a long ride home.</i>

575
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:38,162
You’re still not certain if any
of the Wraith on the planet survived ?

576
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:40,085
Not certain, no.

577
00:39:40,287 --> 00:39:43,563
My people were concerned
about their own survival at that time.

578
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:44,961
Understandably.

579
00:39:45,647 --> 00:39:49,162
But, of course, it’s my fault they were
in that position in the first place.

580
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:53,366
If l had just disposed of those prisoners,
none of this would have happened.

581
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:57,358
Isn’t that what you’re gonna write
in your report ?

582
00:39:58,247 --> 00:40:00,681
Quite the contrary, in fact.

583
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:05,403
It was your decision to fire on the camp
from orbit that eliminated the threat--

584
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:07,438
At least we hope it was eliminated.

585
00:40:07,647 --> 00:40:09,638
- -and allowed your team to escape.

586
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:13,521
l didn’t make that decision.

587
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:15,400
But you would have.

588
00:40:15,807 --> 00:40:19,686
If, hypothetically, Dr. McKay had
managed to get the hive subspace...

589
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:22,919
... communicator working,
and you’d been apprised of the situation.

590
00:40:23,127 --> 00:40:24,685
Well, l...

591
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:26,196
l might have.

592
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:28,403
- Close enough.
- But that’s not what happened.

593
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:30,518
The IOA doesn’t need to know that.

594
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:34,882
In fact, they don’t wanna know that.

595
00:40:35,407 --> 00:40:39,195
In my business, sometimes it’s more
important not to let inconvenient facts...

596
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:41,602
... get in the way of the greater truth.

597
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:43,763
And the truth is...

598
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:47,198
... you should remain here,
in charge of this expedition.

599
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:52,565
For the moment.

600
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:58,197
Dial Earth, please.
