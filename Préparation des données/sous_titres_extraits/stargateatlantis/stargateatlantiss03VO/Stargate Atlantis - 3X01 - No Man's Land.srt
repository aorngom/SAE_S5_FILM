00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:03,564
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis :

1
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:05,718
<i>Gonna need a name.</i>
<i>How does mike sound ?</i>

2
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,843
The retrovirus works.
Just look at the guy.

3
00:00:09,047 --> 00:00:13,996
- l’m returning to what l am.
- <i>Our dear lieutenant rejoined the Wraith.</i>

4
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:16,596
He’s taken the knowledge
that Atlantis still exists.

5
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,156
We’ve detected a hive ship heading
towards Atlantis.

6
00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:21,158
l think we can assume it’s Michael.

7
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:23,961
Your retrovirus will allow us
to feed off enemy Wraith.

8
00:00:25,727 --> 00:00:27,797
- Receiving transmission.
- What is, exactly ?

9
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:30,726
Everything you’ve wanted to know
about Wraith technology.

10
00:00:30,927 --> 00:00:34,556
Once we get in range, we beam
a canister into the CO2 chamber and :

11
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,325
One hive ship de-Wraithified.

12
00:00:36,527 --> 00:00:39,041
There’s been a change in plans.

13
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,364
Two hive ships on our position.
One of them is the friendly.

14
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:45,405
The queen wants you to witness
the fruits of your labor.

15
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:48,286
Within the ship’s schematics
was a worm-like computer virus.

16
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:49,436
What did they get ?

17
00:00:49,607 --> 00:00:51,882
The location of every world
in our database.

18
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:02,119
With 302s, we might take out
the hyperdrive, save us some time.

19
00:01:02,287 --> 00:01:03,481
Do it.

20
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:05,881
Shields are at 60 percent.

21
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:12,919
- <i>I’ve got incoming.</i>
- Daggers 3 and 4...

22
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:16,079
- ... try to keep these Darts off our six.
- Roger that.

23
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:35,243
Half the bogeys are pursuing
Daggers 3 and 4.

24
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:38,046
We got the other half hot on our tail.

25
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:41,523
l’m taking fire. l’ve lost a generator.

26
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:44,003
Stand by to break left on my mark.

27
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:45,725
Mark.

28
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:49,436
Fox 4.

29
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:03,998
We’re in the clear. Continue to target.

30
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:06,246
Shields are under 20 percent.

31
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:09,519
Get your flight back to the ship.
We need to jump out of here.

32
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:12,645
<i>Two minutes and I can shut down</i>
<i>their hyperdrives.</i>

33
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:15,919
Unless you can shut down their weapons
it’s not gonna do much good.

34
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:18,235
Damn it.

35
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:21,479
Dagger 2, l could use some cover
on my attack run of the target.

36
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:24,081
<i>Roger that, leader. I’m on my way.</i>

37
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,123
The Darts are returning to the hives.

38
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:35,760
Can you go to max thrust ?

39
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,601
Negative.

40
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:40,885
- Head back to the <i>Daedalus</i>.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

41
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:43,043
The hives are opening
hyperspace windows.

42
00:02:57,687 --> 00:02:59,598
Why the hell did they do that ?

43
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:01,997
Three of our 302s are returning
to <i>Daedalus</i>, sir.

44
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:04,158
- Sheppard ?
- His fighter isn’t one of them.

45
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:07,484
The only contacts l have on-screen
are wreckage.

46
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:10,840
- What about his locator beacon ?
- Nothing, sir.

47
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:12,836
He’s just gone.

48
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,125
Understood.

49
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:36,205
Okay, this is new.

50
00:04:55,607 --> 00:04:58,758
Colonel Caldwell,
what’s the status of the repairs ?

51
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:01,085
Ongoing.

52
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:03,556
We lost a few key personnel
in the attack.

53
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:06,756
Yes, we did.

54
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:09,999
l’m sorry.

55
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:14,242
So am l, but this isn’t the time
to mourn them.

56
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:18,241
l’ve just briefed General Landry. We’re to
check in and advise him of our response.

57
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:21,843
l’ve got a broken ship and casualties.
l don’t know what you have in mind--

58
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:24,567
- l want you to redeploy immediately.
- Excuse me ?

59
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:27,560
As long as they’re still
in striking distance we have to try.

60
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:29,883
You know we can’t intercept them
in hyperspace.

61
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:32,277
- Radek ?
- Well, obviously they’ve upgraded...

62
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:35,206
... their FTL drives using the information
from our database.

63
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:36,800
- The <i>Aurora</i> mission.
- Obviously.

64
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:39,322
However, their ships are organic
in nature.

65
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:42,843
They will need to make brief pauses
to recover from hyperspace radiation.

66
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:46,005
- Where and when ?
- It will take some time to calculate.

67
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,922
- Go.
- Okay.

68
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:54,285
Dr. Weir, l wanna go after
these bastards as much as you do...

69
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:57,041
... but the <i>Daedalus</i> is in no position
to fight right now.

70
00:05:57,487 --> 00:06:00,126
Our shields are depleted.
Several decks are inaccessible.

71
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:03,205
Even if we could catch up,
l don’t know how long we’d last.

72
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:05,477
Which is why l’m committing
the <i>Orion</i> as well.

73
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:08,036
It was recalled the moment
the virus was revealed.

74
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:10,920
- It’s in no better shape than <i>Daedalus</i>.
- It will fly.

75
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:14,443
And by the time you reach the hive ships
it should also be able to fight.

76
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,996
- And if it isn’t ?
- Currently, Stargate Command...

77
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:22,002
... has no vessels capable of engaging
the hive ships before they reach Earth.

78
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:26,684
They cannot be allowed
to get that far, Steven.

79
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:33,802
You know what
you’re asking me to do ?

80
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:36,203
l do.

81
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:43,798
There’s still repairs
that need to be made.

82
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,046
Do what you have to do.

83
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:11,405
They couldn’t have.

84
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:13,398
If they deduced
the location of Earth...

85
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,001
... they wouldn’t be able to get there,
unless they...

86
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:20,006
They downloaded something
along with the hive-ship plans.

87
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,202
Something like spyware.

88
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,597
It’s like when l stupidly
downloaded por--

89
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:25,837
Music, when l downloaded music.

90
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:29,965
l asked them to do it.

91
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:33,119
l did this. l’m responsible
for the destruction of my own planet.

92
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,084
Anybody was gonna do it,
it’d be you.

93
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,203
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much for that.

94
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:38,800
Stop worrying now. Just focus.

95
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:41,720
On what ? What is there to focus on ?
l’m stuck in a cocoon.

96
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:43,684
- Getting out of here.
- Right. Of course.

97
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:46,407
Why didn’t l think of that ?
Of course. Here goes.

98
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,639
Nope, still can’t move.

99
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:54,160
l’m pretty sure
they’re struggle-proof there, big guy.

100
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:08,318
Okay, can’t sit here forever.

101
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:14,363
Hit them while they’re in hyperspace,
they’Il never know what happened.

102
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,956
Is that even possible ?

103
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:20,159
<i>There’s no reason to believe</i>
<i>their hyperspace field is different...</i>

104
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:22,318
... and we can’t launch 302s
while in hyperspace.

105
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:25,718
l’m talking about maneuvering
within the field, not passing through it.

106
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:27,445
What do you think ?

107
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:31,764
- Colonel ?
- What ? Yes.

108
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,441
He’s not listening.

109
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:38,162
l gotta pay more attention
to those guys.

110
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:56,557
Yes, Michael ?

111
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,482
You should have told me...

112
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:02,756
... that we were going to betray
the Atlanteans.

113
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:06,198
- Are you feeling sympathy for them ?
- No.

114
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:08,796
But l don’t understand
why l wasn’t told.

115
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,840
l told you their plan
because l believe it was a viable way--

116
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:15,522
You are only alive because
you still may prove to be useful.

117
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:18,522
But l fear, Michael...

118
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:22,686
... that the lingering stench
of what they’ve transformed you into...

119
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:24,997
... will never fade.

120
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:39,484
<i>In approximately one hour,</i>
<i>the Wraith will drop out of hyperspace...</i>

121
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,239
<i>... here.</i>

122
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:45,325
<i>It’s just outside</i>
<i>of the Pegasus galaxy.</i>

123
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:48,918
There they will pause for 15 hours.

124
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:51,846
If <i>Daedalus</i> and <i>Orion</i> break orbit
on our current schedule...

125
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:53,679
... they should reach
those coordinates...

126
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:56,680
... in just under 14 hours,
best possible speed.

127
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,724
<i>Narrow window.</i>

128
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:00,366
It’s the only window, sir.

129
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,795
Understood.

130
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,958
Now, the International
Oversight Advisory...

131
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:06,118
... wants you to brief them
on this matter.

132
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:09,085
- <i>When would you like me to dial again ?</i>
- You misunderstand me.

133
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:11,442
l mean in person,
and l mean right now.

134
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:14,917
- <i>The president himself is--</i>
- l can’t just leave. Not now.

135
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:16,719
l’m afraid that’s not up to you.

136
00:10:16,927 --> 00:10:19,043
- There is far too much going on here.
- <i>Doctor.</i>

137
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:21,636
You’ve done all
you’re going to do for now.

138
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:24,367
l need you to step through that gate.

139
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,717
<i>They’re waiting for you</i>
<i>in my briefing room.</i>

140
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:30,678
Dr. Weir ?

141
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:35,165
l see.

142
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:44,917
Teyla, we are awaiting several teams
to return from their missions.

143
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:48,284
Once that happens, l’d like to suspend
gate travel till this is over.

144
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,846
Of course.

145
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:53,556
l’Il need you to dial in
once the <i>Daedalus</i> is ready.

146
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,365
l know what to do, Élizabeth.

147
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:57,085
Of course you do.

148
00:10:57,247 --> 00:11:00,319
- l will see you when you return.
- Thank you.

149
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:33,166
Welcome back to Earth.

150
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:35,636
Thank you, general.
It’s wonderful to be here.

151
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,240
l can see that.

152
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:40,205
You know, l considered
disobeying your order.

153
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,483
There wouldn’t have been too much
you could do.

154
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:44,797
You made the right decision
in coming.

155
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:47,527
We’re in the middle of a crisis.
This is absolutely--

156
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:51,043
Don’t bite my head off, Élizabeth.
The recall order didn’t come from me.

157
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:52,765
Who it came from doesn’t matter.

158
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:55,282
What if l told you it came
from the president ?

159
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:56,766
l wouldn’t believe you.

160
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:58,758
And you’d be right.

161
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:03,002
But in a couple of weeks,
there could be aliens on our doorstep...

162
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,840
... determined to feed
on the human race.

163
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:09,079
The president had no choice
but to accede to the l. O.A.’s demand...

164
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:11,044
... that you be brought back to explain.

165
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:16,600
So, what do they really want ?

166
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:19,605
To point fingers, cover their asses.

167
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:23,320
l am honestly not sure
how l will respond to that, sir.

168
00:12:23,527 --> 00:12:26,041
They’re bureaucrats, Élizabeth.

169
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:28,675
You’Il have them for breakfast.

170
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,361
There is work l must attend to.

171
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:52,677
Stand aside !

172
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:58,042
Am l to sit quietly in my quarters ?

173
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:11,723
You know, these are actually
quite comfortable.

174
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:14,640
Surprisingly warm,
take all the pressure off the spine.

175
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:17,799
They’re as good a place as any
to witness the end of humanity.

176
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:19,719
You’re wasting your energy talking.

177
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:22,606
Okay, let’s say a magic fairy
comes down...

178
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:25,964
... and grants you one wish,
and we break out ? Then what, huh ?

179
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:28,362
We’re in a hive,
traveling through hyperspace...

180
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:31,246
... probably in the massive void
between our two galaxies...

181
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:34,717
... where there aren’t even planets,
let alone stargates. What then, huh ?

182
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:36,724
We fly home on the wings
of imagination ?

183
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:39,447
- Is that what we do, Ronon ?
- You can sit here and die...

184
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:40,835
... but l’m not giving up.

185
00:13:41,047 --> 00:13:44,005
- Oh, fine. l will.
- Fine !

186
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:54,082
Okay, time to do some damage.

187
00:13:57,607 --> 00:13:59,677
Ronon, Rodney, can you hear me ?

188
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:05,956
<i>Rodney ? I know this is a long shot,</i>
<i>but if you can hear me, please respond.</i>

189
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:12,157
<i>If you’re near a radio,</i>
<i>I need you to come in.</i>

190
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:15,637
<i>I need to know your location.</i>
<i>Guys ?</i>

191
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,286
Colonel Sheppard.

192
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:20,357
- <i>Is that you ?</i>
- Who’s this ?

193
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:25,357
- You know me as Michael.
- Sorry, got the wrong number.

194
00:14:25,527 --> 00:14:28,360
<i>Ronon and Dr. mcKay are still alive.</i>

195
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:33,440
- What are you gonna do with them ?
- If you want them to live, listen to me.

196
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:42,160
If your friends are in pursuit, you need to
disable these ships for them to reach us.

197
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:44,801
If you really wanna help,
why don’t you just do that ?

198
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:48,317
- They would know.
- Aren’t you « they« ou » ??

199
00:14:48,527 --> 00:14:51,325
Please believe me when l say
l was as deceived as you were.

200
00:14:51,527 --> 00:14:53,643
Oh, l don’t know.
l was pretty deceived.

201
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:56,037
<i>It seems that because of what</i>
<i>you did to me...</i>

202
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,679
... the Wraith no longer see me
as one of their own.

203
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:03,602
That’s why you wanna help,
because you don’t feel welcome.

204
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:06,958
- We don’t have time to discuss this.
- <i>Sure we do. I’ve got...</i>

205
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,805
... a good three hours of air left.

206
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:13,680
- Where are you ?
- Wouldn’t you like to know ?

207
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:17,402
l need to know what level you’re on
so l can guide you from there.

208
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:20,161
<i>You mean trust you ?</i>

209
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:22,439
Are you in a position not to ?

210
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:26,843
l’ve got you right where l want you.

211
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:29,567
<i>I doubt I will be allowed to live</i>
<i>much longer...</i>

212
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:32,759
... and yet l very much
want to continue living.

213
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:35,043
If you want to survive as l do...

214
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:37,357
... then l suggest you tell me
where you are.

215
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:43,562
l’m outside the hive in a 302
about to blast your ship.

216
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:45,685
<i>You still wanna help ?</i>

217
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:48,486
Targeting the ventral hyperdrive
would be most effective.

218
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:51,520
Yeah, that’s what l was thinking.

219
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:55,123
<i>Then I suggest you act now</i>
<i>before you are discovered.</i>

220
00:15:57,927 --> 00:15:59,997
The leader of the hive
presented a scenario...

221
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,557
... which made it seem
we were under a time constraint.

222
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:06,525
To speed up the problem solving,
we distributed the file.

223
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:09,679
And played right into their hands.

224
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:11,960
Yes.

225
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:16,757
In fairness, Dr. Weir kept us informed
of every action they took along the way.

226
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:19,441
And we supported
her recommendations, l know.

227
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:23,361
But clearly, we were not in possession
of all of the facts.

228
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,320
Obviously, neither were we,
ambassador.

229
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:32,003
What measures have you taken to
prevent the Wraith from reaching Earth ?

230
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,761
l was coordinating a strike
when you recalled me.

231
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:36,366
With what ?

232
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:40,084
- With everything we’ve got.
- Is that wise ?

233
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:44,000
General Landry has informed me...

234
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:47,637
... that in light of fleet resources
committed to fighting the Ori...

235
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:49,758
... the weapons platform
in Antarctica...

236
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:54,000
... powered by a pair of Mark-ll generators
would be Earth’s only defense.

237
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:59,359
l believe it would be better to stop them
while they’re within reach of Atlantis.

238
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,285
Wouldn’t it have been more prudent...

239
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:03,915
... to send the ZPM back to Earth
on the <i>Daedalus</i>...

240
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:05,679
... ensuring successful operation...

241
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:08,281
... of the weapons platform
when the Wraith arrive ?

242
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:11,320
The <i>Daedalus</i> suffered severe damage
during the first battle.

243
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:13,961
A long journey at full power
was out of the question.

244
00:17:15,807 --> 00:17:19,117
There is no way of knowing how much
faster the Wraith ships have become.

245
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:21,755
You’d risk the lives
of everyone aboard those ships...

246
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:23,605
... in order to undo your mistake ?

247
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:32,316
<i>Daedalus</i> is in orbit above Atlantis,
performing emergency repairs.

248
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:34,876
There is still time to beam
the ZPM aboard.

249
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:39,645
But either plan will require <i>Daedalus</i>
to break orbit within the next hour.

250
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:44,126
Then if you’Il excuse us, we need
some time to discuss our options.

251
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:46,882
l have instructed Atlantis
to contact the SGC...

252
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:49,641
... when both <i>Daedalus</i> and <i>Orion</i>
are ready to leave.

253
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:52,924
If you’d like to overturn my
standing orders at that time, go ahead.

254
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,767
But you will have to fire me first.

255
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:08,480
Wonder what they’Il do to us.
Feed on us probably.

256
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:10,399
l mean, that’s...
That’s what they do.

257
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,205
It’s not gonna come to that.

258
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:13,880
Maybe.

259
00:18:14,047 --> 00:18:16,481
Earth will probably mount
some kind of defense.

260
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:19,357
In which case,
death would be instantaneous.

261
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:23,240
Unless we’re trapped on a deck
with a fire or something.

262
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:25,602
Then we’d be burned alive.

263
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:28,645
Well, burned alive or suffocate.

264
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:31,086
l wonder which would be worse :

265
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:33,477
Being life-sucked by the Wraith,
or burned alive.

266
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,399
l couldn’t consider two worse options.

267
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:38,877
- Stop talking.
- Okay, you know what ? Make me.

268
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,725
What are you doing ?

269
00:18:46,447 --> 00:18:47,596
Where did you get that ?

270
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:54,196
l was trying to get my hand free
so l could get it.

271
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,959
Would it have killed you
to tell me ?

272
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:03,725
Maybe l would have if you’d shut up
for more than a minute.

273
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:05,798
What ? Don’t just stand there.
Cut me loose.

274
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:10,277
Only if you put an end to all this
« we’re gonna die, there’s no hope « talk.

275
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:11,482
Well, now there’s hope.

276
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,719
Get ready.

277
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:26,597
A little help with this ?

278
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:31,801
- It’s freezing out here.
- Would you prefer to go back in ?

279
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,640
- No.
- So now what ?

280
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,320
- What ?
- How do we get out of here ?

281
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:38,876
- Well, l don’t--
- What ?

282
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:41,003
- You said no more death talk.
- Okay.

283
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:42,759
We’re out of the cocoons. So what ?

284
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:45,043
We’re still on the ship.
There’s no way off it.

285
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:47,767
- Well, any survivable way.
- You’Il think of something.

286
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:50,725
- It’s not a question of thinking.
- You’Il think of something.

287
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:52,684
Fine. Can we at least
go somewhere else ?

288
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:56,078
Can you get this off me ?
It’s down my back. It’s down my back.

289
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:57,805
Just...

290
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:07,564
So, what do they wanna do ?

291
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:09,797
They’re still arguing about it.

292
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:12,435
- Of course they are.
- Incoming wormhole.

293
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:20,204
<i>This is Atlantis. We have</i>
<i>a scheduled check-in with Dr. Weir.</i>

294
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:21,959
Stand by, Atlantis.

295
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:24,083
They haven’t reached a decision.

296
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:26,198
And they don’t want to, Mr. Woolsey.

297
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:30,002
If they agree or disagree with me, then
they have to take some responsibility.

298
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:34,120
They’d rather have someone to blame.
l give this order...

299
00:20:34,287 --> 00:20:36,278
... either way, they have a scapegoat.

300
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:38,961
It’s all part of the game.

301
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:40,562
Ma’am ?

302
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,600
Teyla.

303
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:47,922
Yes, Élizabeth.

304
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:51,796
<i>Tell Colonel Caldwell to proceed</i>
<i>with the mission as planned...</i>

305
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:56,518
- ... and Godspeed.
- <i>I will tell him.</i>

306
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:03,286
Hermiod, what’s our status ?

307
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:06,524
Shields are at full strength.
l’ve rerouted nonessential power...

308
00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:09,241
<i>... in order to ensure power levels</i>
<i>for a longer period.</i>

309
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:12,319
l want all missile tubes loaded
with Mark-lll tactical warheads.

310
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:14,523
- That would be every one.
- l’m aware of that.

311
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:17,724
Disable all firing safeties
to launch every one of our missiles...

312
00:21:17,887 --> 00:21:20,879
- ... the moment we exit hyperspace.
- l’m not sure that’s possible.

313
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,924
- Make it possible, please.
- Yes, sir.

314
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:26,764
<i>major Lorne, we’re approaching</i>
<i>our T-zero.</i>

315
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,956
Zelenka says she’Il fly, sir, but as of
right now that’s about all she can do.

316
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:33,886
You’Il have 13 hours to get
your weapons and shields online.

317
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:37,039
We need to leave now to make
this window. Are you go or no-go ?

318
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:38,726
We’re a go, sir.

319
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:40,076
Very well. On my mark :

320
00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:43,205
Three, two, one, mark.

321
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:55,163
You sure McKay and Ronon are nowhere
near the area l’m about to light up ?

322
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:58,039
l’m certain.

323
00:21:58,367 --> 00:21:59,516
Good luck.

324
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:02,560
Thanks. It’Il be a walk in the park.

325
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:04,922
A very scary park...

326
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:08,636
... filled with monsters
who are trying to kill me.

327
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:11,924
- <i>I don’t understand.</i>
- Never mind.

328
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:22,285
Operation This-Will-Most-Likely-End-Badly
is a go.

329
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:41,040
<i>Target is destroyed.</i>

330
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:44,802
Disable the second hive quickly.
Their fighters will be headed your way.

331
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:54,638
How about this help
you were talking about ?

332
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:58,004
- <i>I told you, target the hyperdrive.</i>
- l already knew that.

333
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:01,438
- There’s nothing l can do.
- Like hell there isn’t. Call off the Darts.

334
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,558
They won’t listen to me.

335
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:06,327
This is not helpful, Michael.

336
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:27,639
Dr. Weir ?

337
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:29,684
What can l do for you, Mr. Woolsey ?

338
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:31,644
The ambassadors
have finished convening.

339
00:23:31,807 --> 00:23:32,922
Oh, good timing.

340
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:36,079
Yes. They’d like to continue
debriefing you now.

341
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:39,523
- Yeah, l bet they would.
- Excuse me ?

342
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:42,997
No. l’m not gonna sit there
and have them rake me over the coals...

343
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:46,876
... about every decision l’ve made
that they don’t agree with in hindsight.

344
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:50,562
l have the greatest respect for you
but as far as the l. O.A. is concerned...

345
00:23:50,727 --> 00:23:52,922
... you’re not exactly
the employee of the month.

346
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:57,399
If the Wraith make it to Earth, keeping
my job will be the least of my concerns.

347
00:23:57,567 --> 00:24:02,436
- And if your plan succeeds ?
- Then l expect to keep my job, yes.

348
00:24:02,847 --> 00:24:06,886
Because l did what they apparently are
incapable of doing. l made a decision.

349
00:24:07,807 --> 00:24:10,196
The fact is, at this point,
there is nothing more...

350
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,642
... we can do but wait and see
what happens.

351
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:15,244
But give them my best.

352
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:44,642
We have been walking around here for
a day and l haven’t seen one exit sign.

353
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:46,798
Sooner or later,
l’Il have to eat something.

354
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:49,356
- l think l have a plan.
- You ? Really ?

355
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:51,961
- You know a lot about these ships, right ?
- Maybe. Why ?

356
00:24:52,127 --> 00:24:54,561
If l get you to a panel,
how much damage could you do ?

357
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,843
- What ?
- Overload the engines and blow the ship ?

358
00:24:57,007 --> 00:24:59,282
- How is that an escape plan ?
- l never said it was.

359
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:01,278
- That’s a plan ?
- You said there’s no way out.

360
00:25:01,447 --> 00:25:04,644
- If we’re dead, let’s take them with us.
- l’d rather die a hero than a meal.

361
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,320
- You can do it ?
- Yeah, probably.

362
00:25:06,527 --> 00:25:07,676
Now you’re talking.

363
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:16,797
You should not be here.

364
00:25:17,527 --> 00:25:19,324
She asked me to question
the prisoner.

365
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:25,160
If you’d prefer
to discuss it with her...

366
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:28,920
Release him.

367
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:32,725
l will take him from here.

368
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:43,602
You had me worried there.

369
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:46,918
You’ve slowed them down,
at least for a little while.

370
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,476
We need to get to a ship,
hope your friends find us.

371
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:51,399
Not till we free Ronon and McKay.

372
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:53,717
We’re headed toward them now.

373
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:56,886
Now, that’s what l call help.

374
00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:01,324
Exiting hyperspace in 10 seconds.

375
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,916
Launch the moment
the target’s acquired. Don’t wait.

376
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:06,555
Five, four, three--

377
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,759
- Missiles are away.
- Dart activity ?

378
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:21,919
Quite a number of them.
They’re moving to intercept our missiles.

379
00:26:22,407 --> 00:26:24,204
Now would be a good time, <i>Orion</i>.

380
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:38,485
What the hell ?

381
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,638
One of your ships
has launched an attack.

382
00:26:42,807 --> 00:26:44,718
Their strike inflicted damage
on this hive.

383
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:45,876
Good.

384
00:26:46,047 --> 00:26:48,766
The other was undamaged.
Your vessel’s continuing to engage.

385
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:51,839
Are you gonna go through
the play-by-play or get out of here ?

386
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:53,886
This way.

387
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:02,645
- Ship’s engaged in battle.
- With who ?

388
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:04,240
- Doesn’t matter.
- Matters to us.

389
00:27:04,407 --> 00:27:05,522
- Why ?
- If it’s our guys...

390
00:27:05,687 --> 00:27:07,917
... our chance went back above zero,
fractionally.

391
00:27:08,087 --> 00:27:11,796
If it’s our guys, all the more reason to
damage this ship and help them. Move it.

392
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,326
One missile got through, sir.

393
00:27:13,487 --> 00:27:16,206
One of the Wraith ships suffered damage
but the other one--

394
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:18,927
The <i>Orion</i> has arrived.
The hive is moving to intercept.

395
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:21,123
- They launched their weapons ?
- Negative, sir.

396
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:22,800
Open a secure channel.

397
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:27,482
<i>major Lorne, now would be a good time</i>
<i>to open fire.</i>

398
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,040
Yes, l was thinking the same.

399
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:31,402
l gave the order, but nothing happened.
Zelenka ?

400
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,841
l’m trying !

401
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:36,244
We’re having difficulty transferring
power from shields to weapons.

402
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:39,245
- There’s a hive bearing on your position.
- <i>Yes, sir. I see.</i>

403
00:27:39,447 --> 00:27:42,041
- Stand by. Doc, you’re killing us.
- Okay. l have it.

404
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:43,401
Firing drones.

405
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:08,076
The remaining hive
is shifting their attack to <i>Orion</i>.

406
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:09,362
Move to intercept.

407
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:13,076
<i>Orion</i> has no shields. We’re not gonna
make it there in time, sir.

408
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:27,361
Where are they ?

409
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:30,200
l’m sorry. They must have
been taken for feeding.

410
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:33,882
No, no. These were cut from the inside.
They escaped.

411
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,607
They could be anywhere on this ship.

412
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:38,120
Well, that’s a start.

413
00:28:38,287 --> 00:28:40,960
Why ? What could their objective
possibly be ?

414
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:43,846
If l know Ronon, they’re somewhere
they can do much damage.

415
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:46,885
And McKay would know where
and how to do that, so...

416
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:49,721
There’s a control station this way.

417
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:58,845
One more shot, that’s all l’m asking.

418
00:28:59,007 --> 00:29:01,601
l just cannot give you
what l don’t have.

419
00:29:03,887 --> 00:29:06,606
There’s too much damage.
We need to abandon ship.

420
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:09,201
- Listen to me.
- We sacrificed our shield capability...

421
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:12,962
... for that first salvo. This ship
is going to blow any moment, major.

422
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:18,165
Caldwell, l’m afraid we’ve done
everything we can on our end.

423
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:20,238
Request immediate beam out
to <i>Daedalus</i>.

424
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,517
Get them over here.

425
00:29:29,807 --> 00:29:32,116
Their operating system is a mess.

426
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:34,755
Thank goodness l remember DOS.

427
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:38,685
- Trust me, that was hilarious.
- Have you done it yet ?

428
00:29:38,847 --> 00:29:41,407
Look, this ship has been
seriously damaged.

429
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:43,683
It’s hard for me to find something
to overload.

430
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:45,246
Let Mikey try.

431
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,003
- He’s helping us.
- Where did you come from ?

432
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:54,045
l latched onto the hull
before it went into hyperspace.

433
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:57,319
- Nice move.
- Saw it in a movie once.

434
00:29:58,287 --> 00:30:00,676
- We gotta get to the <i>Daedalus</i>.
- The <i>Daedalus</i> is here ?

435
00:30:00,847 --> 00:30:03,645
- We need to get to the transport.
- Why should l trust you ?

436
00:30:06,527 --> 00:30:08,995
Because l’m trusting you.

437
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:18,246
Because l said so.

438
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:32,323
- l don’t like this.
- You got a better idea ?

439
00:30:32,487 --> 00:30:34,603
We take the ship on our own
and leave him here.

440
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,280
He’s the reason l’m alive now.

441
00:30:36,447 --> 00:30:39,757
l don’t think that’s possible. It took
days to crack the Dart interface.

442
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:41,679
- This ship is bigger.
- l don’t like it.

443
00:30:41,847 --> 00:30:45,476
- Yeah, l get it. You hate the Wraith.
- Him in particular.

444
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:48,285
Is there anything to boost a signal ?

445
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:50,563
l wanna reach the <i>Daedalus</i>
as soon as possible.

446
00:30:50,727 --> 00:30:52,365
- Well, l could try.
- Hang on.

447
00:30:52,527 --> 00:30:55,041
They’Il open fire on us
the second we leave the bay.

448
00:30:55,207 --> 00:30:58,404
Oh, great. The day just gets
better and better.

449
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:12,527
- Sorry, sir. We did our best.
- Nothing to apologize for.

450
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:15,406
Bring guns to bear on the Dart bays.
Hold fire till l order.

451
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:18,684
Channel every ounce of power
to the forward shield until then.

452
00:31:18,887 --> 00:31:21,606
l have a contact.
Single Wraith ship, possibly a transport.

453
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:23,883
Just left the hive
and is on a course for us.

454
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:26,999
- It’s broadcasting on our frequencies.
- What do they want ?

455
00:31:27,207 --> 00:31:29,960
- Maybe they want to surrender ?
- Not likely. Let’s hear it.

456
00:31:30,127 --> 00:31:33,278
<i>This is Sheppard, authentication code</i>
<i>Alpha-Seven-Tango-Three.</i>

457
00:31:33,447 --> 00:31:34,562
<i>Please respond.</i>

458
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:35,716
Open a channel.

459
00:31:38,047 --> 00:31:39,799
Colonel Sheppard,
we’d written you off.

460
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:41,559
<i>Don’t get all emotional on me now.</i>

461
00:31:41,727 --> 00:31:44,685
<i>I’ve got mcKay, Ronon and michael</i>
<i>aboard a Wraith transport.</i>

462
00:31:44,887 --> 00:31:46,002
- Michael ?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

463
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:47,566
<i>He’s got a plan you’Il like.</i>

464
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:50,481
<i>It won’t be long before they start</i>
<i>shooting at us.</i>

465
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:54,037
- The hive opened fire on the transport.
- Beam them directly to the bridge.

466
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:59,037
- Colonel.
- You said something about a plan ?

467
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:02,722
l’ve disabled their jamming code.
It’s a matter of time before they realize.

468
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:05,964
- All you have to do is send a nuke.
- We deployed all our warheads.

469
00:32:06,127 --> 00:32:09,244
- The hive is launching Darts.
- Open up on those bays, all batteries.

470
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:34,036
Shut that off !

471
00:32:41,807 --> 00:32:43,877
- Report.
- The plan worked, sir.

472
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,965
The concentrated fire on the bays
created secondary explosions.

473
00:32:47,127 --> 00:32:49,357
- They’ve stopped firing.
- Nice work, colonel.

474
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,523
A draw is a win for our side.
Ship status ?

475
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:54,647
Shields completely depleted.
We’re venting atmosphere.

476
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:56,800
Seal off all affected decks.

477
00:32:56,967 --> 00:33:00,164
That last blast took out life support.
The backups aren’t responding.

478
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:01,919
Right now, we’re shallow-breathing.

479
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:05,080
- Meaning ?
- Meaning that in under nine hours...

480
00:33:05,247 --> 00:33:07,522
... we’re all gonna suffocate.

481
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:19,635
As long as we don’t worry
about shields and weapons...

482
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:22,526
... we may be able to cannibalize parts
from other systems...

483
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:25,076
... in order to create
a CO2 filtration system.

484
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:27,078
By the time we got that
up and running...

485
00:33:27,247 --> 00:33:30,557
... the CO2 levels will overwhelm
any makeshift scrubbers we concoct.

486
00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:32,797
- But it’s worth a try.
- Yes, but regardless...

487
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:36,562
... we need more electricians and welders
than are certified on this ship.

488
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:39,605
Anyone, and l mean anyone,
who took shop needs to report to us.

489
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,962
- Teams assembling on every deck.
- Good, good.

490
00:33:42,127 --> 00:33:45,278
Now we’re talking. How many more
of these do we have ?

491
00:33:45,447 --> 00:33:47,358
- Twenty in total.
- How many people onboard ?

492
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:48,755
In and around the 200 mark.

493
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:51,441
Buddy-breathing our way through
is out of the question.

494
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:53,404
- l’m afraid so, sir. Yes.
- Okay, fine.

495
00:33:53,607 --> 00:33:55,518
They’re for people
working on life support.

496
00:33:55,687 --> 00:33:58,281
- We need those people clear-headed.
- By « those people« ou » ?-- ?

497
00:33:58,447 --> 00:34:00,438
- l’Il be one.
- How many levels inaccessible ?

498
00:34:00,607 --> 00:34:02,006
- Seven.
- We need to find out...

499
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:05,239
... if there’s pockets of atmosphere.
We may squeeze another hour...

500
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:08,285
- ... from the regions sealed off.
- We can’t transfer the O2...

501
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:09,800
- ... where we need.
- We could--

502
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:12,959
We’Il be able to access panels closed off.
Get Sheppard in a 302.

503
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:15,925
He can eyeball it from the outside.
l’Il take this.

504
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:25,881
These sections are completely open
to space, Rodney.

505
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:28,481
There aren’t even pockets
you could beam into.

506
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:30,285
What about an EVA ?

507
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:33,122
Space suits were stored
in those sections.

508
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:36,677
- <i>All right, I’m heading back.</i>
- Copy that.

509
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:38,758
Have you tried routing
from the inertial-- ?

510
00:34:38,927 --> 00:34:41,441
Yes, yes, yes.
We have tried everything.

511
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:42,722
Subspace communications ?

512
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:46,038
We are floating
between two galaxies, Radek.

513
00:34:46,207 --> 00:34:47,799
Atlantis has no ship to send.

514
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:51,562
Even if we were able to repair the array
and get a message back to Earth...

515
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:54,361
... it would still take them weeks
to get a rescue here.

516
00:34:54,567 --> 00:34:56,285
l wasn’t thinking of rescue.

517
00:34:56,447 --> 00:34:59,325
l was thinking of telling them
that we’ve stopped the Wraith.

518
00:34:59,487 --> 00:35:01,557
Letting someone know
the sacrifice we’ve done.

519
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,440
Well, a noble sentiment,
but l would prefer to dedicate...

520
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:08,077
... my last breath of air
to getting more air.

521
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:11,164
Wait a second.

522
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:13,835
The only air within light years
is on the Wraith ship.

523
00:35:14,007 --> 00:35:17,124
There’s also Wraith aboard
that Wraith ship, doctor.

524
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:20,006
So we take them.
Beam an assault team in.

525
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:22,080
You would be far outnumbered.

526
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,482
Well, we’re dead here.
l’Il take my chances.

527
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:30,437
l admire your courage, colonel, but you
would be dead there as surely as here.

528
00:35:34,207 --> 00:35:36,118
Unless we send over the gas.

529
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:40,242
Yes, yes, yes. That could work.

530
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:43,280
The retrovirus gas would make them
virtually harmless.

531
00:35:43,487 --> 00:35:46,604
- Do we still have it onboard ?
- Yes, we do.

532
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,878
Michael’s disabled
their jamming codes--

533
00:35:49,087 --> 00:35:52,318
- We finish the plan we started.
- We beam over the gas and wait.

534
00:35:52,527 --> 00:35:54,916
We wait long enough,
they won’t wanna put up a fight.

535
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:58,238
They’Il be humans with no memories.
l might actually survive this.

536
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:02,320
We’re almost out of air. The retrovirus
takes 10 hours to run its course.

537
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,360
Yeah, well, we’Il rotate the crew
in and out of the 302s.

538
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:09,758
If this works,
can you fly the hive ship ?

539
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:13,245
l could.

540
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,156
What do you say, colonel ?

541
00:36:17,607 --> 00:36:20,440
Weaps, get us within beaming range
of the hive.

542
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:22,565
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

543
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:32,004
- Anything ?
- No.

544
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:34,084
No contacts yet.

545
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:38,684
Our tests of the Mark-ll generator
and the chair in Antarctica are promising.

546
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:41,441
« Promising. » That doesn’t sound
very promising.

547
00:36:41,607 --> 00:36:45,316
We’re fairly confident the Ancient
weapon will take care of the hive ships...

548
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:48,479
... but doing so will probably require
the last of our drones...

549
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:51,207
... and there goes our secret weapon.

550
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:54,165
We’d really rather not have to do that.

551
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:57,323
How’d it go with the l. O. A ?

552
00:36:57,487 --> 00:36:58,476
Oh, you know.

553
00:36:58,647 --> 00:37:02,322
l mean, does anyone ever come out
of an l. O.A. deposition saying :

554
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,476
« That went well« ou » ??

555
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:05,683
No, l don’t suppose they do.

556
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,125
It was what it was.

557
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:11,558
At least most of the time
you’re a galaxy away.

558
00:37:11,727 --> 00:37:15,436
That Woolsey guy is here
almost every other week.

559
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,397
l think they’re gonna ask me
to step down.

560
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:24,644
Well, if they’re just gonna ask,
you can always say no.

561
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:30,043
l messed this one up, general.

562
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:32,325
Yeah, you did.

563
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:35,159
l lost some of the best people--

564
00:37:35,327 --> 00:37:37,443
You proceeded with the blessing
of the l. O.A.

565
00:37:37,927 --> 00:37:40,680
And Stargate Command, as l recall.

566
00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:42,644
Somehow, that doesn’t seem
to help much.

567
00:37:42,847 --> 00:37:45,077
Success is not final.

568
00:37:45,247 --> 00:37:47,556
Failure is not fatal.

569
00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:51,720
It’s the courage to continue
that counts.

570
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:54,555
And l think you’ve got that in spades.

571
00:37:56,927 --> 00:37:59,521
- Churchill ?
- Yeah.

572
00:37:59,687 --> 00:38:02,281
Except for that last part about you.

573
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,597
That was all me.

574
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:10,205
- Get some sleep, Élizabeth.
- Yes, sir.

575
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:49,397
Our CO2 levels
are getting dangerous, sir.

576
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:52,999
The gas has barely had a chance
to run its course.

577
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:55,681
We don’t have much of a choice.

578
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:57,758
We gotta go now.

579
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:33,956
Some of them are dead.

580
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:38,355
Looks like they killed each other.

581
00:39:39,447 --> 00:39:41,119
What’s happened ?

582
00:39:44,287 --> 00:39:45,640
All right.

583
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:47,001
It’s all right.

584
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:50,682
Find a holding area.
Start marshaling the survivors there.

585
00:39:51,447 --> 00:39:53,756
The queen’s chamber
should be that way.

586
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:14,359
Hello ?

587
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:19,925
You all right ?

588
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:23,276
It’s okay.
You’re gonna be all right now.

589
00:40:38,847 --> 00:40:39,996
Didn’t work on her.

590
00:40:41,527 --> 00:40:43,757
Beckett wondered if the females
would be immune.

591
00:40:43,927 --> 00:40:46,760
Something you might’ve mentioned
before she almost killed me.

592
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:49,043
- l only thought of it now.
- <i>Colonel Sheppard.</i>

593
00:40:49,207 --> 00:40:51,880
<i>So far we haven’t run into</i>
<i>a single Wraith, sir.</i>

594
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:55,596
Understood. Sheppard to <i>Daedalus.</i>

595
00:40:55,807 --> 00:40:57,877
- <i>Go ahead.</i>
- You can start sending people over.

596
00:40:58,047 --> 00:41:01,244
They’re all human and the air is good.
l think we’re out of the woods.
