NARRATOR :
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis :

1
00:00:03,327 --> 00:00:05,761
We are the last of those
you refer to as Ancients.

2
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:08,561
There’s a lot of Wraith,
we could use help fighting them.

3
00:00:08,727 --> 00:00:12,037
We will eliminate the Wraith
at a time of our choosing.

4
00:00:12,247 --> 00:00:15,159
- They don’t seem very Ancient-y to me.
- Ancient-y ?

5
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:18,359
WEIR : Hopefully, this is just
a stumbled beginning of a--

6
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,884
McKAY : They’re not people.
DEX : McKay !

7
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:27,238
They’re machines. Replicators.

8
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:34,245
McKAY : So l’m in Atlantis and l need
to get to Earth. What do l do ?

9
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:36,358
Since we no longer have
access to a ZPM...

10
00:00:36,527 --> 00:00:38,597
... due to unforeseeable circumstances...

11
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:41,042
... my only option would be
to call the <i>Daedalus</i>...

12
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:44,483
... and spend the next three weeks
waiting to get back home.

13
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:46,598
Until now.

14
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:51,756
l give you the McKay<i>/</i>Carter
Intergalactic Gate Bridge.

15
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:55,442
Thirty-four gates from the Milky Way
and Pegasus gate systems...

16
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:59,361
... have been strategically placed
in the void between our two galaxies.

17
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:02,883
Simply enter on either side--
For example, Atlantis.

18
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:04,082
- -and boom.

19
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:07,837
A macro that l have written
specially for the occasion...

20
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:11,204
... will command each gate in the chain
to store you in its buffer...

21
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:16,646
... and forward you along to the next
and the next until you arrive here.

22
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:20,726
Once at the Midway Space Station,
you exit the Pegasus gate system...

23
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:23,765
... and enter the Milky Way gate system
where a similar macro...

24
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:27,078
... designed by yours truly,
will forward you along to the SGC.

25
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:30,205
Total travel time,
a little over 30 minutes.

26
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:31,402
Cue applause.

27
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,679
Thank you. Enough.

28
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,003
Midway Space Station
isn’t completed yet, so...

29
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,556
... we’Il test the system today
using a Puddle Jumper.

30
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:42,718
- Now, given the his--
CALDWELL : Show and tell’s over.

31
00:01:42,887 --> 00:01:45,606
The test is about to begin.
Let’s get back to our stations.

32
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:47,041
Right.

33
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:10,040
All systems seem to be...

34
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:11,196
Hm.

35
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:13,120
What ?

36
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:17,280
Oh, there’s an odd echo
in the proximity sensors.

37
00:02:17,447 --> 00:02:19,881
Won’t affect the test, but...

38
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:22,358
Yeah, we’re ready to go.

39
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:33,680
SHEPPARD : <i>Gate is dialed.</i>
<i>Forwarding macro’s been uploaded.</i>

40
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:36,202
All right, John. You have a go.

41
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:40,002
All right, then. Here goes.

42
00:02:56,647 --> 00:02:57,682
McKAY :
We have a contact.

43
00:02:58,327 --> 00:03:01,000
Colonel Sheppard, right on time.
What’s your status ?

44
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:04,204
It felt a little weird,
but everything seems to be in one piece.

45
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:06,796
<i>Ready to proceed to next phase.</i>

46
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:09,123
Uploading macro...

47
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:11,557
... and initiating dialing sequence.

48
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:17,245
No, no, no. This is weird.

49
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,678
- Shall l tell him to stand down ?
- No. It’s nothing to do with the test.

50
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:23,759
It’s just our sensors
aren’t working properly.

51
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:25,719
<i>Daedalus</i> ready to proceed.

52
00:03:25,927 --> 00:03:27,076
Do l clear him ?

53
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,399
Yeah, yeah. l’m sure he’s fine.

54
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:33,682
He’s good to go. Good to go.
Yes, go ahead.

55
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,803
Colonel Sheppard, you have a go.

56
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,798
Jumper is away.

57
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:55,435
He’s late.

58
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:59,520
When traveling three million light-years,
l’m not sure there’s such a thing as late.

59
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:02,760
Right. Yes.

60
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:06,044
You’re just mad you didn’t get to fly
the maiden voyage yourself.

61
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:10,240
General, l am quite fond
of both maidens and voyages.

62
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:13,683
- Put the two together and you--
- You’re not a test pilot anymore, Jack.

63
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:15,880
That’s what the president said.

64
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:18,518
HARRIMAN :
Incoming wormhole.

65
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:25,236
It’s about time.

66
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:27,200
SHEPPARD :
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

67
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,801
Colonel Sheppard, welcome to Earth.

68
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:33,005
- Thank you, sir. Good to be back.
LANDRY : <i>You know where to park.</i>

69
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,761
We’Il debrief, go over the flight data
when you’re ready.

70
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:37,765
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

71
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:43,039
Colonel, we’re receiving a data burst.

72
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:45,243
Jumper 3 has arrived
at Stargate Command.

73
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:46,965
- Mission accomplished.
- It worked.

74
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:49,322
- l’m already on to the next problem.
- Which is ?

75
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:52,604
Well, the sensors are having
a hard time determining what it is...

76
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:55,042
- ... probably due to the Doppler effect.
- What is ?

77
00:04:55,247 --> 00:05:00,685
l’m detecting a foreign object
traveling at. 999 the speed of light.

78
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,283
And it’s coming this way.

79
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,722
MAN :
We have a contact, sir.

80
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,637
- Col. Sheppard’s back from Earth.
- Welcome back.

81
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,796
SHEPPARD :
<i>Thank you, colonel.</i>

82
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:19,879
l’ve got a takeout pizza
for everyone back in Atlantis.

83
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,278
<i>With your permission, I’d like to upload</i>
<i>and dial out before it’s cold.</i>

84
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:26,280
Negative. We’re putting that leg
of the trip on hold for now.

85
00:06:26,447 --> 00:06:29,166
Seems like we’re expecting company.

86
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:34,562
Believe it or not, moving that fast
while an incredible feat of technology...

87
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,842
... isn’t very useful.

88
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:38,601
Certainly in comparison
to travel through hyperspace.

89
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:42,999
Now, moving as fast as it is,
this ship-- Assuming it is a ship.

90
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:46,085
- -would take at least a million years
to reach the Milky Way.

91
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:49,319
That close to the speed of light,
you take relativity into account.

92
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:52,718
Exactly. The people onboard--
Assuming that they are people.

93
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:56,596
- -would only experience maybe 12 years.
A few stasis chambers, they’re laughing.

94
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:59,958
Not laughing, they’re unconscious,
but, metaphorically--

95
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:03,881
So assuming it’s a ship,
and assuming they’re people--

96
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:06,686
- What do we do ?
- We try and make contact. Obviously.

97
00:07:06,847 --> 00:07:08,075
CALDWELL :
How do we do that ?

98
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,040
Pull up, honk the horn,
get them to roll down their window.

99
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:14,637
l’m talking about matching their speed.
This ship isn’t designed to do it.

100
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:18,516
We can’t. Even if we succeeded we’d be
subject to the same time dilation effects.

101
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:21,440
We’d be out of contact with Earth
and Atlantis for years.

102
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,723
Can’t we overtake them
with our hyperdrive ?

103
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:27,084
Yes, but they would blow past
as we dropped back into normal space...

104
00:07:27,287 --> 00:07:30,245
... because our sublight engines
are incapable of accelerating...

105
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:34,002
- ... to anywhere near the speed of light.
- So we max out the sublight engines.

106
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,839
Get as close as we can get.

107
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:39,886
Yes, that might work. We should at least
be able to stay in range long enough...

108
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:41,560
... to get sensor readings. Yeah.

109
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:44,804
Do it. l’Il let Atlantis know
you’re gonna be late.

110
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:51,199
Did you really get pizza for everyone ?

111
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:54,677
Because it would be a shame for that
to go waste if we’re going to--

112
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:57,926
Yeah, okay.
So solve this first, and then--

113
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:07,276
Sir, we’ve got everything we’re gonna
get out of the sublight engines.

114
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:11,326
They’re going to fly by us
in three, two, one.

115
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:21,283
Interesting.

116
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:23,796
- What ?
- If these readings are correct...

117
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:26,197
- ... and to be fair, they may not be--
- Rodney.

118
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:29,358
It’s an Ancient warship.

119
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,086
It’s possibly Aurora-class.

120
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:33,276
Who’s flying it ?

121
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:35,798
l would imagine Ancients.

122
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:39,084
There hasn’t been any of them around
for over 10,000 years.

123
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:42,757
Relativity. Look. Remember, for them,
only a handful of years have passed.

124
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:46,755
- Don’t those ships have hyperdrives ?
- Maybe it was damaged in battle.

125
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,964
It happens with us all the time.
Maybe it conked out on the way...

126
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:52,766
... and they had to continue
close to light speed.

127
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:55,959
They got light-years away from Pegasus
without leaving years ago.

128
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:58,277
You know their subspace drive specs
better...

129
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:01,757
... but an Aurora-class ship has
the power to do what you’re suggesting ?

130
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:05,078
- Well, maybe they have a ZPM.
- That would be worth finding out.

131
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:07,966
We need to send them a message
before they get out of range.

132
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:11,324
Like :« ou » ?We are humans from Earth,
currently occupying Atlantis. »

133
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:13,398
Why don’t we just ask them
to slow down ?

134
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:16,206
Colonel Caldwell,
the unidentified vessel is slowing down.

135
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:17,876
Maybe they heard me.

136
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:19,406
No, they saw us.

137
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:23,515
And they’re not just slowing down.
They slammed on the brakes at 27 g’s.

138
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:25,200
So now what ?

139
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:32,403
Unknown vessel, l am Captain Helia
of the Lantian warship <i>Tria.</i>

140
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,437
Our ship has suffered damage.

141
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:39,486
We scanned your vessel and determined
that it is capable of hyperspace travel.

142
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,524
We’ve begun deceleration maneuvers.

143
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:45,403
Will you render assistance
in a form of hyperspace transport ?

144
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:47,484
Well, yes. Yes, of course, we will.

145
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:51,802
- l don’t think she can hear you.
- Open a channel.

146
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:56,559
This is Colonel Steven Caldwell
of the Earth ship <i>Daedalus.</i>

147
00:09:56,727 --> 00:10:00,037
It would be an honor to assist you
in any way we possibly can.

148
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,446
We’re going to meet Ancients.
Flesh and blood Ancients...

149
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:08,201
... who know everything.
l don’t know what to ask first.

150
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:11,245
It’s gonna be hours
before we match velocities for transport.

151
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:13,597
That should give you time
to write that list.

152
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,325
Right. Right.

153
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:19,645
They were battle-scarred
and already on their way to Earth...

154
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:21,399
... when their hyperdrive gave out.

155
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,127
They decided it’s best to
continue forward than go back.

156
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:26,755
- And how many survivors ?
- Just over a hundred.

157
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:30,846
Word has spread amongst my people.
They believe this return was foretold.

158
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:33,919
It marks the turning in the tide
in the war against the Wraith.

159
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:35,446
l don’t know about that.

160
00:10:35,607 --> 00:10:38,246
Dr. Weir ? The <i>Daedalus</i> is ready
to beam down our people...

161
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:41,080
- ... and the Ancient delegation.
- Thank you.

162
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:52,127
Dr. Weir, Ronon, Teyla, this is Helia,
captain of the Ancient ship <i>Tria.</i>

- Thank you.

164
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:59,242
From what l’m told, you’ve done
a remarkable job preserving our city.

165
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:01,563
We did what we could
with what we had.

166
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:04,523
l need to speak
to the leader of your people.

167
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:06,518
l’m in charge
of the Atlantis expedition.

168
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:08,484
You misunderstand me, Dr. Weir.

169
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:12,475
l need to talk to the one who can speak
for all the people of Earth.

170
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:16,284
That can certainly be arranged.
But may l ask why ?

171
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,437
What is that ?
How come l’ve never seen that ?

172
00:11:27,607 --> 00:11:31,043
- Excuse me. What’s going on ?
- Thank you for all you’ve done, Dr. Weir.

173
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:34,758
But your guardianship of this city
is no longer necessary.

174
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:38,120
The city is now under my control.

175
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:47,727
HELIA : We were in a battle
with Wraith cruisers.

176
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:51,077
They proved too much for us.

177
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:54,041
So we started back to Atlantis...

178
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:57,517
... only to be told the final evacuation
was already in progress.

179
00:11:57,687 --> 00:12:00,485
l decided to push on to Earth
and join the evacuees.

180
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:04,680
And even when our hyperdrive failed,
we decided to continue on.

181
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:07,800
l can’t begin to imagine what you...

182
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,879
... and your crew must be going through
right now.

183
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:13,965
We owe you and your people
a debt of gratitude...

184
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:16,721
... but we’ve just returned home.

185
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:20,603
Home to a place we thought
we’d never set eyes on again.

186
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:23,402
And we need some time.

187
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:24,842
Alone.

188
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:29,356
You do know that we’ve shed
our own fair share of blood...

189
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:31,483
... defending the city from the Wraith.

190
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:33,279
By your own admission...

191
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:35,483
... you are responsible
for waking the Wraith.

192
00:12:37,327 --> 00:12:40,524
- Right.
- And by your own admission...

193
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:43,838
... you are responsible for the emergence
of the Wraith as a species.

194
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:47,039
The fact is,
if it weren’t for our expedition...

195
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:48,765
... there would be no Atlantis.

196
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,527
No one’s saying
the city doesn’t belong to you...

197
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:53,922
... or that you don’t belong here.

198
00:12:54,127 --> 00:12:57,039
- What we’re saying is that--
- What we’re asking--

199
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,120
What we’re asking...

200
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:05,757
... is that we be allowed to stay here.

201
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:09,084
WOOLSEY : There is so much
that we can learn from you.

202
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:12,400
And in return, we can offer supplies,
manpower...

203
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:16,640
... the kind of support you’Il need
to restore Atlantis to its former glory.

204
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:20,641
The day will come when your people
will once again have a place here.

205
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:24,764
But that is not this day.

206
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:30,081
You should be in there.

207
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:32,920

to make any difference.

SHEPPARD :
You’re right. They want us out of here.

209
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:38,605
But why ? There are maybe
a hundred or so of them.

210
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:40,519
They could use us.
They might need us.

211
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,882
What if you were forced
from your home by war...

212
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:45,515
... only to return to find
someone on your couch...

213
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:47,797
... eating your Cheetos,
watching your TV ?

214
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:51,484
- l’d be fine with that.
- No, you wouldn’t.

215
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:57,841
- How go the talks, sir ?
- No talks.

216
00:13:58,007 --> 00:13:59,679
Listening is what we did.

217
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:02,481
It was essentially
a transitional meeting.

218
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:06,117
They needed to know how much time
we needed to vacate the city.

219
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:08,801
l said 48 hours, unless you need more.

220
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,524
No. That should be enough.

221
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:16,279
That’s it ? We’re going to take this
lying down ? We rescued them.

222
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:18,603
- And they’re grateful.
- They’re not showing it.

223
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:21,600
From their point of view, Dr. McKay,
they’re being generous.

224
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:25,682
Keep in mind, when they left Atlantis,
we were a hunter-gatherer species.

225
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:30,278
If we hadn’t hunted and gathered them
between galaxies they’d still be stuck.

226
00:14:30,447 --> 00:14:33,757
- We should’ve left them there.
- l know you feel you’re losing the city.

227
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:37,681
This isn’t about losing a city, Richard.
This is about losing an opportunity...

228
00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:40,799
... to talk with and learn
from living, breathing Ancients.

229
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:43,876
They are willing, over time...

230
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:47,486
... to let us back in the city.
Just not right now.

231
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:50,522
That way, we get all of the benefit
of Atlantis...

232
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:52,723
... with very little of the risks
or expense.

233
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,395
It’s not like we don’t have
our galaxy to worry about.

234
00:14:57,007 --> 00:15:00,238
Colonel, l’d like you to supervise
the withdrawal.

235
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,686
- Yes, sir.
- Go ahead.

236
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,123
Can l talk to you for a moment ?

237
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:16,156
l didn’t want to say this in front
of McKay. l know he’d want the job.

238
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:18,122
What job ?

239
00:15:18,287 --> 00:15:23,805
The Ancients are willing to leave
someone behind as a liaison, kind of a...

240
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,044
- ... ambassador, if you will.
- l would be more than happy--

who’s more qualified for that job.

- Woolsey ?
- Yeah.

246
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:45,282
To paraphrase the Ancients,
they think you won’t be able...

247
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:47,640
... to let go.

248
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:51,277

They have found a suitable planet
for us to relocate to.

00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:40,124
Yes, we do, but thanks
to your Intergalactic Gate Bridge...

492
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:42,403
... all they have to do
is rewrite your macro...

493
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:44,876
... and they can come out
anywhere in the Milky Way.

494
00:30:45,047 --> 00:30:49,040
- But those macros are very complicated.
- They are very complicated, Dr. McKay.

495
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:51,243
They just rewrote
their own damn base code.

496
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:52,926
l think they can handle it.

497
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:55,516
General O’Neill and Woolsey
may still be alive.

498
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,040
l know the city very well.

499
00:30:57,207 --> 00:30:59,641
Give me 60 Marines
and some of Colonel Carter’s new--

500
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:02,241
- Anti-Replicator weapons.
- Yeah, those things.

501
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:04,557
l’m sorry, colonel.
l have standing orders.

502
00:31:04,727 --> 00:31:07,878
They happen to be
General O’Neill’s standing orders.

503
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:11,562
The <i>Daedalus</i> will be there
in a little under four days.

504
00:31:11,727 --> 00:31:15,515
Now, how do l get a nuke
past their shield ?

505
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:23,398
Now, those Replicator thingamajiggies
you’re talking about--

506
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:25,922
Let’s just call them A.R. G’s.

507
00:31:26,087 --> 00:31:28,681
McKAY : They’re energy weapons,
disrupting links between nanites.

508
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:30,644
Replicators fall apart when fired upon.

509
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:34,123
You know, hypothetically...

510
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:37,842
... Teyla and Ronon would be
more than willing to help. If we asked.

511
00:31:38,207 --> 00:31:39,845
WEIR :
We would need to gate into Atlantis.

512
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:42,561
All they need to keep us out
is to activate the gate shield.

513
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,962
l did write a back door
to the shield program...

514
00:31:45,127 --> 00:31:46,719
... when Kolya stormed the city.

515
00:31:46,887 --> 00:31:50,721
So l mean, it could, hypothetically,
let us get into the gate room.

516
00:31:50,927 --> 00:31:54,237
Landry was worried about Replicators
rewriting the bridge macro...

517
00:31:54,407 --> 00:31:56,398
... to gate them somewhere
in the Milky Way.

518
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:58,762
Does that mean you could change
the macro ?

519
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:00,599
Take us somewhere else in Pegasus ?

520
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:05,124
Somewhere like, just talking here,
the Athosian settlement...

521
00:32:05,287 --> 00:32:06,606
... where Teyla and Ronon are ?

522
00:32:06,807 --> 00:32:10,083
- We’d need a Jumper.
- And some of those A.R. G’s.

523
00:32:10,287 --> 00:32:13,040
And someone to make sure
Landry doesn’t close the iris.

524
00:32:13,927 --> 00:32:16,361
- Hypothetically.
- Of course.

525
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,797
The Jumper is in its storage area,
under guard.

526
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:21,481
We need to be added
to the authorized personnel list.

527
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:23,000
Only one guy who can do that.

528
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:25,840
- You ?
- No. Why do you think l’d say me ?

529
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:28,965
- Seemed like you were leading up to it.
- No, sadly.

530
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:31,482
Dr. Lee’s been heading
the Jumper research project.

531
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:33,638
They refuse to send it
to Area 51 for me.

532
00:32:33,847 --> 00:32:37,203
l should be able to add one
of our key cards to the list...

533
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:39,278
... but l have to do that from his office.

534
00:32:39,487 --> 00:32:41,637
- So ?
- Well, he’s in his office...

535
00:32:41,807 --> 00:32:43,957
- ... so you need to distract him.
- Me ? How ?

536
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:45,919
Well, here’s what l’m thinking...

537
00:32:46,127 --> 00:32:50,564
l got to say, l have never met a woman
this into World of Warcraft.

538
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:54,402
- It’s a silent passion of mine.
- As it is with all of us.

539
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:58,355
l’m level-75 mage...

540
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:00,677
... specializing in engineering
and jewelling.

541
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:04,684
- You ?
- Oh, wow, level 75 ?

542
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:08,320
Me, l’m only 50.

543
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:12,164
Well, l had the beta
of the expansion pack...

544
00:33:12,327 --> 00:33:15,285
... so l sort of had a leg-up
on most people.

545
00:33:15,447 --> 00:33:16,516
What’s your race ?

546
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,520
Mage.

547
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:25,720
You know l’m trying to increase
my enchanter skills...

548
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:28,476
... but, l don’t know.
It’s not going very well.

549
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:32,925
- Oh, l disagree, Bill.
- What ?

550
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:37,642
- Rodney.
- l don’t mean-- l’m sorry.

551
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:41,362
- l don’t mean to be so forward.
- No, no, go, be forward.

552
00:33:42,327 --> 00:33:44,887
Well, oh, l-- Look.

553
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:49,080
l’m not quite sure
how exactly l should put this...

554
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:53,555
A true mage speaks his mind.
Or her mind, in your case.

555
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:56,600
Wow, will you look at the time ?
Where does it go ?

556
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:59,839
- What ?
- We’re late. We should--

557
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:02,959
- We’Il see you, Bill.
- Bye, Bill.

558
00:34:14,247 --> 00:34:15,680
SHEPPARD :
Wallace.

559
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:17,280
What are you doing here ?

560
00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:20,120
General Landry wanted to talk to me
about reassignment.

561
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:23,524
Oh, right. Sorry about that.

562
00:34:24,247 --> 00:34:26,477
Are you already going on missions
without me or-- ?

563
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,763
You should really stay off
of that ankle, son.

564
00:34:28,927 --> 00:34:32,442
WALLACE : Yeah, well, when General
Landry says now, he means now.

565
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:33,756
SHEPPARD :
Sorry about this too.

566
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:40,640
Can’t afford to have him
telling Landry he ran into us.

567
00:35:06,127 --> 00:35:07,799
SHEPPARD :
Let’s move.

568
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:16,038
- You set ?
- Go for it.

569
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:22,442
[ALARM SOUNDS]

570
00:35:22,807 --> 00:35:24,479
What the hell ?

571
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:27,443
General Landry to the control room
immediately.

572
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:30,322
They’re going to get
through my hack quickly.

573
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:32,921
It’s all right. l don’t need much time.

574
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:35,715
- What’s going on ?
- Gate started dialing on its own.

575
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:37,724
- It doesn’t do that.
- l know that, sir.

576
00:35:40,127 --> 00:35:42,277
LANDRY : Close the iris.
- l can’t, sir.

577
00:35:42,447 --> 00:35:45,564
Find a way, Walter.
Colonel Sheppard, stand down.

578
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:48,281
That is a direct order.

579
00:35:49,687 --> 00:35:51,678
Do you want to find out
where they’re going ?

580
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:54,805
Don’t bother. l already know.

581
00:36:05,087 --> 00:36:06,964
My turtles.

582
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:09,562
WEIR : What ?
- l just bought some wee baby turtles...

583
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:11,524
... and no one knows to feed them.

584
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:14,724
Well, turtles are pretty hardy.
l’m sure they’Il be fine.

585
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:16,155
And they make good soup.

586
00:36:17,607 --> 00:36:22,203
l figured l’m back for good, so l might
as well get a pet. l’m allergic to cats.

587
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:25,484
l’m at work too long to be fair to a dog,
so l went with turtles.

588
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:27,281
l’ve probably killed them.

589
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:30,559
- Anytime now, McKay.
- Trust me, l am going as fast as l can.

590
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:32,246
Poor little buggers.

591
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:37,920
Milky Way gate just activated.

592
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:40,755
- Did you do that ?
McKAY : No.

593
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:44,840
<i>Colonel Sheppard, I’m going to assume</i>
<i>that you’re still at the midway Station...</i>

594
00:36:45,007 --> 00:36:48,124
<i>... waiting for Dr. mcKay to rewrite</i>
<i>his macro.</i>

595
00:36:48,287 --> 00:36:52,121
<i>I understand what you’re doing, colonel.</i>
<i>Hell, I’Il even call it brave.</i>

596
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:54,755
<i>But if you don’t turn</i>
<i>that ship around immediately...</i>

597
00:36:54,927 --> 00:36:59,557
<i>... and come back to the SGC, I’Il see</i>
<i>to it that your career in the military is--</i>

598
00:36:59,727 --> 00:37:00,921
[BEEP]

599
00:37:02,647 --> 00:37:04,922
That way, l won’t know
what he was going to say.

600
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:06,879
Okay. Okay, l’ve got it.

601
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:10,239
All right.
Last chance to change our minds.

602
00:37:14,127 --> 00:37:17,676
All right. Let’s do it.

603
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:31,403
LADON : l knew you would never come to
me, so l thought l would come to you.

604
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:33,997
Our relationship has been...

605
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:36,325
... strained...

606
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:38,842
... but we need to put all that
behind us now.

607
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:40,676
We do ?

608
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:44,483
Your friends have returned home
and you’ve been asked to leave Atlantis.

609
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:46,245
So the question is :

610
00:37:47,007 --> 00:37:48,565
What will you do next ?

611
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,076
We are helping my people
rebuild this settlement.

612
00:37:51,247 --> 00:37:53,158
Yes, but the settlement seems finished.

613
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:57,002
Besides, is carpentry and clearing brush
really the best use of your skills ?

614
00:37:57,247 --> 00:37:58,839
Get to the point.

615
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:00,686
Come work with me.

616
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:03,200
l understand your reluctance.

617
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:07,042
In the past, the Genii have hardly been
a beacon of hope in the galaxy.

618
00:38:07,207 --> 00:38:10,995
-« ou » ?In the past« ou » ??
- We are growing stronger every day.

619
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:14,762
We have a number of operations planned
that could cripple the Wraith.

620
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:16,800
What do you have in mind ?

621
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:20,525
l am, of course, reluctant
to go into specific details here.

622
00:38:22,047 --> 00:38:24,607
But suffice it to say
the plans are dangerous...

623
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:26,678
... and in need of your unique abilities.

624
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:29,200
We’re not interested.

625
00:38:30,127 --> 00:38:32,038
Well, that’s too bad.

626
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:34,118
Although not entirely surprising.

627
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:36,884
Give it some time, Ronon.

628
00:38:38,207 --> 00:38:41,597
l wonder how much joy you’Il find
as a Tava bean farmer.

629
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:47,796
- l’m not going to work for the Genii.
- We would not be working for them.

630
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:50,959
- Merely with them.
- Forget it.

631
00:38:51,607 --> 00:38:53,837
Since Atlantis was returned
to the Ancestors...

632
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:57,363
... the Genii are the most powerful
and organized group of humans...

633
00:38:57,527 --> 00:38:59,119
... fighting the Wraith.

634
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:01,005
The Ancestors will do something.

635
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:06,040
True but they neither need
nor have they requested our help.

636
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:07,276
The Genii have.

637
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:11,844
l know that you are anxious
to return to the fight...

638
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:13,645
... but my people are farmers.

639
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:17,637
- Maybe this isn’t the place for me, then.
SHEPPARD : That smells great.

640
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:22,726
- Hope you saved some for us.
- John ?

641
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:26,761
- It is wonderful to see you. All of you.
WEIR : And you.

642
00:39:26,927 --> 00:39:29,395
We missed that. Whatever that is.

643
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,878
Something’s wrong.

644
00:39:34,887 --> 00:39:36,639
McKAY :
They emit a directional energy beam...

645
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,798
... that disrupts connection
between nanites.

646
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:39,956
Not what l asked.

647
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:43,717
- Yes, they work good.
DEX : Good.

648
00:39:44,487 --> 00:39:47,445
So you need us because we know
our way around the city ?

649
00:39:47,727 --> 00:39:49,957
l need you because you’re part
of our team.

650
00:39:50,407 --> 00:39:53,046
There may be hundreds of Replicators
on Atlantis by now.

651
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:54,526
We’ve got a plan. A good one.

652
00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:57,679
l wouldn’t ask you to come with
if l didn’t think we could do it.

653
00:39:57,847 --> 00:40:01,396
O’Neill and Woolsey were on Atlantis
when the Replicators attacked.
