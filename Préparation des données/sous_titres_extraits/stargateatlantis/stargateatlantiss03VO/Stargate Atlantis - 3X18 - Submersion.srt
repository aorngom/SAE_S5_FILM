<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis :

1
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:07,046
You have some Wraith DNA.

2
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,243
My father told people
that it was a gift.

3
00:00:09,407 --> 00:00:12,160
l could help my people by warning
of the Wraiths’approach.

4
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:15,319
No matter how many Wraith ships
they destroyed, more kept coming.

5
00:00:15,487 --> 00:00:18,365
You think Teyla might tap
into this Wraith psychic network ?

6
00:00:18,527 --> 00:00:19,596
If she can...

7
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:22,560
... we’Il be able gather all the intel
we needed about them.

8
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:25,605
l would not consider asking you
to do this if l didn’t think...

9
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:27,837
... it could provide us
with vital information.

10
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:32,205
And Dr. Beckett will remain on hand
at all times to monitor your physiology.

11
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:33,846
l am on a ship...

12
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:41,046
You are all so pathetic.

13
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:07,557
« Shotgun, » is it ?

14
00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:09,479
Come on.

15
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:13,242
Don’t know why l have to do this.

16
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:22,520
What ?

17
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,282
Nobody said anything.

18
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:25,522
You don’t have to.

19
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:28,997
It’s not my fault things are hard to find
on the bottom of the ocean.

20
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:30,919
Rodney, you said you knew
where it was.

21
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:35,558
l said l knew its last known location.
It is a mobile drilling station, remember ?

22
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:38,241
- That’s gonna take a few hours.
- If we don’t find it...

23
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:41,683
- ... this will be your last known location.
- Oh, zing.

24
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:44,281
Okay, kids, do l have
to pull this thing over ?

25
00:01:44,767 --> 00:01:48,555
It’s hard enough being in this damn thing
for hours without listening to you guys.

26
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:52,555
Dr. McKay has managed to narrow the
search field to a remarkably small area.

27
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:56,078
Finally, a voice of reason.
Thank you, Dr...

28
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:57,686
- Graydon.
- Yes, yes, of course.

29
00:01:57,887 --> 00:02:00,117
Well, welcome to the team.

30
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,562
l’ve been here almost eight months.

31
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:04,080
Really ?

32
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:09,004
It’s been that long, has it ?
Time certainly flies.

33
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:12,125
Unless you’re in a Jumper,
looking for a needle in a haystack.

34
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:13,322
You know what ? Shut up.

35
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:16,479
- You know what ? You shut up.
- l don’t hear Grayson complaining.

36
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:18,877
It’s Graydon, with a » D. »

37
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:20,440
What ? You sure ?

38
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:22,524
It’s my name.

39
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:26,519
No, l could’ve sworn the guy
l wanted was called Grayson.

40
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:29,918
Because l remember thinking
« Dick Grayson, » Bruce Wayne’s ward.

41
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:31,645
Well, it’s Graydon.

42
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:36,281
Guess that means
l hired the wrong guy.

43
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:39,278
Well, still glad you came ?

44
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:45,403
Oh, sorry. l was preoccupied thinking
about the geothermal drilling platform.

45
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:47,325
It shouldn’t take us much longer.

46
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:49,079
We just passed a thermal layer.

47
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:52,080
l’m getting some readings
a couple of hundred feet ahead.

48
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:55,364
If we did manage to find an alternate
and limitless power supply...

49
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:58,485
... well, that would make
even this insufferably long search...

50
00:02:58,647 --> 00:02:59,636
... seem worthwhile.

51
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:03,875
Okay, kids, we’re here.

52
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:11,005
Well, hopefully it won’t take too much
longer to power up this station.

53
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:23,519
That wasn’t so hard.

54
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:26,565
All l gotta do is dock this thing...

55
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:29,400
... and we can find out
what this place is all about.

56
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:52,963
All systems are online
and functioning at full capacity.

57
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,924
You mean
we’re generating power already ?

58
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,647
Well, no, but we probably
could if we wanted to.

59
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:00,844
No, slow down. The Ancients
abandoned this project for a reason.

60
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:04,761
Let’s try to find out what that reason
might be before we start drilling.

61
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:07,236
Yes, well, fair enough.

62
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:24,798
Have we not been down
this hallway before ?

63
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:26,764
Every corridor looks the same.

64
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,395
Don’t worry, l have
an uncanny sense of direction.

65
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,842
l think she’s right.
We’ve been down this way.

66
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:35,397
That’s impossible. We took a left
and a left and then a right.

67
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:37,842
Hey, look, all l’m saying is--

68
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,162
What ?

69
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,041
l’m sensing a Wraith presence nearby.

70
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:46,286
Are you sure ?
We’re pretty deep underwater.

71
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:52,044
l cannot be certain, but l believe
it is onboard the drilling platform.

72
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,078
This is Sheppard.

73
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:03,604
Everyone drop what you’re doing, get
back to the control room immediately.

74
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:05,763
We did a complete life signs scan.

75
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:08,157
The first thing we did
when we stepped aboard.

76
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,887
Look, l promise you,
there is nobody here but us.

77
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:12,275
No, Rodney.

78
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:15,519
- And l’m sensing it even closer now.
- Maybe it’s the pressure.

79
00:06:15,727 --> 00:06:18,958
- It’s known to do things to the mind.
- Just humor me and check again.

80
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:30,162
There. All of these life signs
have been accounted for.

81
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:31,362
Humored ?

82
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:35,642
Wraith don’t show up on life signs
detectors if they’re hibernating.

83
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:38,719
- l know what l’m sensing.
- There is no Wraith, l’m telling you.

84
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:41,196
- Has your sense ever been wrong ?
- Never.

85
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,517
And l cannot shake this feeling.

86
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:45,757
- l trust her.
- As opposed to irrefutable fact ?

87
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,883
- Machines don’t know.
- Never said they did.

88
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:50,277
There is a way for me to be sure.

89
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:53,439
If l can reach out with my mind
and establish a link--

90
00:06:53,607 --> 00:06:55,996
- That’s a little reckless.
- If there is no Wraith...

91
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:59,477
... then there will be no mind for me to
link with and therefore no risk.

92
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:01,285
But if there is a Wraith nearby...

93
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:02,800
We need to know.

94
00:07:09,407 --> 00:07:11,841
- l’m ready.
- You sure ?

95
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:15,317
The briefest contact will determine
whether or not l’m right.

96
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:18,206
That’s all we need,
so don’t stick around any longer.

97
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:21,962
And we will bring you out of it
at the first sign of trouble.

98
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:26,517
- Just to be sure--
- It’s already set to stun.

99
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,565
Sorry.

100
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:09,159
Teyla ?

101
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:17,005
l was mistaken.

102
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:18,956
There is nothing there.

103
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:21,402
Now, that’s good.

104
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:24,521
- l’m sorry.
- No reason to be sorry.

105
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:28,240
Perhaps it was the effect of
the pressure at this depth.

106
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,604
Well, if you’ve ever seen <i>The Abyss</i>,
pressure can make you nuts.

107
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:33,766
Not that l think you’re nuts.

108
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:36,119
It’s all right, John.

109
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:37,561
l’m relieved.

110
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,126
So am l.

111
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:41,596
Well, we have a lot of exploring to do.

112
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:42,756
We ?

113
00:08:42,927 --> 00:08:46,124
Until Rodney delivers the preliminary
status report, l’m all yours.

114
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:47,606
Put me to work, colonel.

115
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:50,156
All right, let’s make up some time.
Break into teams.

116
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:52,761
Ronon, you’re with Teyla.
Élizabeth, you’re with me...

117
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:55,122
... or l’m with you,
however you wanna put it.

118
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:58,484
Either way or either way.

119
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:06,158
That was weird.

120
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,684
Well, we are at the very bottom
of the ocean.

121
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:13,522
Maybe you’re right, Teyla’s just
experiencing the effects of the pressure.

122
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:17,043
Hopefully not as bad as that guy
in <i>The Abyss</i>.

123
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,158
This place is big, huh ?

124
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,439
What’s wrong ?

125
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:30,157
- Nothing. Why ?
- You just haven’t said a word.

126
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:31,716
Have l not ?

127
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,960
No.

128
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:37,563
Has my silence made you
uncomfortable ?

129
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,525
No.

130
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:44,838
Your friendship is very important
to me.

131
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:48,760
l would hate to do anything
that made you...

132
00:09:48,927 --> 00:09:50,838
... uncomfortable.

133
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,202
Okay. Well, l’m good.

134
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:37,681
Rodney ? What’s going on ?

135
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:40,645
- What do you mean what’s going on ?
<i>-We just lost the lights.</i>

136
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,240
What ?

137
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:50,916
- You’re right.
<i>-Yes, we can see that.</i>

138
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:53,043
We lost power to 40 percent
of the station.

139
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:55,926
Sensors are currently off-line.
Zelenka, what’re you doing ?

140
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:57,725
What do you mean, what am l doing ?

141
00:10:57,887 --> 00:10:59,764
<i>Have you lost power where you are ?</i>

142
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,440
No, have you ?

143
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:03,643
- No.
<i>-We have.</i>

144
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,365
l wanna know what’s going on.

145
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:08,405
<i>This station has been lying</i>
<i>idle down here for a few millennia.</i>

146
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,761
<i>Bound to blow a few fuses.</i>

147
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:12,839
Look, l’Il have power back online
in a minute. Just hang tight.

148
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:18,516
Ronon, Teyla, report your position.

149
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:24,835
<i>Ronon ? Teyla ? Come in.</i>

150
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:35,840
<i>Ronon ? Teyla ?</i>

151
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:43,602
Rodney, we’ve lost contact with Ronon
and Teyla. Do you know their position ?

152
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:45,485
<i>No. Internal sensors are out.</i>

153
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:47,877
<i>I have the location</i>
<i>where the power went down.</i>

154
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:50,641
It’s an auxiliary control area,
search grid six.

155
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:53,480
<i>The deck that Ronon and Teyla</i>
<i>were exploring.</i>

156
00:11:53,807 --> 00:11:55,320
We’Il meet you there.

157
00:11:55,487 --> 00:11:57,045
Okay, Davidson.

158
00:11:57,207 --> 00:12:00,085
- It’s Dickenson, sir.
- l was in the ballpark. Give me a break.

159
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:01,362
Get back to the Jumper...

160
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:05,406
... see if you can use its sensors to locate
our people within the drilling platform.

161
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:08,127
Graydon, you go with him.

162
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:28,519
There you are.

163
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,559
- Weapons fire.
- Nine mil. This way.

164
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:53,998
Oh, yes, let’s race towards
the gunfire.

165
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:29,522
Ronon, Teyla, come in.

166
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:40,399
Are you all right ?

167
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,637
- No.
- Did you see who attacked you ?

168
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:44,522
Yeah, it was Teyla.

169
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,963
- What ? Why ?
- Okay, until we know what’s going on...

170
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,924
... l’d like everyone in one place.

171
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:05,802
<i>This is Zelenka. Someone has activated</i>
<i>force fields throughout the station.</i>

172
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:08,481
- Can you make it to the control room ?
<i>-Yes, I think so.</i>

173
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,036
- Do it.
- Doesn’t make sense. What’s she doing ?

174
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:14,597
You and Élizabeth go to the control
room. Ronon and l will check on Teyla.

175
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:17,407
- Be careful.
- No kidding.

176
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:44,679
Drop it.

177
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:48,879
John.

178
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:53,315
What the hell’s going on ?

179
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,239
l do not know.

180
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:04,726
- Rodney, what’s the status ?
- As far from the quo as it gets.

181
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:07,082
Teyla didn’t just shut down several
key systems.

182
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:09,477
She scrambled
the existing operating codes.

183
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:12,083
This is going to take a while.

184
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:13,556
Can we contact Atlantis ?

185
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:16,241
The station’s communication is gone.
l can’t patch it.

186
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:19,205
She’s blown the control crystals,
shut down half the power...

187
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,597
... and set up a series
of emergency force fields.

188
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,405
To what purpose ?

189
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,365
<i>This is Sheppard. We got Teyla.</i>

190
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,757
- And ?
- And nothing.

191
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:32,044
She has no memory of anything
that happened in the last hour.

192
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:33,845
We’re on our way to crew quarters.

193
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:34,996
<i>I’Il meet you there.</i>

194
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,556
Let’s forget restoring
this station to its former glory.

195
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,525
Concentrate on internal sensors
and disabling force fields...

196
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,882
... that are cutting us off
from the Jumper.

197
00:15:51,127 --> 00:15:52,640
Élizabeth, l’m so sorry.

198
00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:54,240
Don’t worry about that.

199
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:57,046
- How are you feeling now ?
- l’m fine.

200
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:01,439
But to hear of the damage l caused and
yet to have no memory of my actions...

201
00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:03,444
Just tell us what you do remember.

202
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:09,598
l was attempting to seek out the Wraith
presence with my mind, and then...

203
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:11,636
There is a Wraith ?

204
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:15,396
The most powerful mind
l have ever encountered.

205
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:20,277
- l tried to shut her out.
- Her ?

206
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:23,161
Yes.

207
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:25,045
l believe this Wraith is a queen.

208
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:29,280
- l hate queens.
- In that brief moment, l sensed...

209
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:35,484
... great power, the experiences
of many centuries.

210
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:37,365
Hunger.

211
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:39,324
And then...

212
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:41,239
... nothing.

213
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:45,681
My next memory is of Colonel Sheppard
and Ronon aiming their weapons at me.

214
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:47,798
There’s a Wraith
on the drilling platform.

215
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:51,516
Well, if that were the case, why’d she
use Teyla to do all that damage...

216
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:54,042
... and why didn’t
the detector pick up a signal ?

217
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:55,401
It doesn’t matter.

218
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:58,161
- If she’s here, l’Il find her.
- We’Il find her.

219
00:16:58,327 --> 00:16:59,760
l would like to help.

220
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:05,326
l’m sorry, Teyla.

221
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,357
- But until we can determine what’s--
- Yes, of course.

222
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:11,518
l understand.

223
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:19,922
<i>Dickenson. Any progress</i>
<i>on disabling those force fields ?</i>

224
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:23,159
<i>I’m getting indications that some</i>
<i>of them are going up and down.</i>

225
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:26,683
<i>-We could use the Jumper’s sensors.</i>
- l’m doing my best, sir.

226
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:29,955
One of these days,
l’m gonna call him Dr. McCoy.

227
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:33,597
- l’d love to be there for that.
- The next time he calls me Grayson.

228
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:35,962
Actually, l know a Grayson.

229
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:40,561
- There really is a Grayson ?
- Yeah, he’s a damn good scientist too.

230
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,922
l’m surprised McKay didn’t hire him.

231
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:47,036
Did you do that ?

232
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:50,119
l don’t know.
But l’m happy to take credit for it.

233
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:52,564
- Check it out.
- Yeah.

234
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:25,316
l don’t understand.

235
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:28,285
What could the Wraith want with an
Ancient drilling platform ?

236
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:29,800
How did they even get here ?

237
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:32,845
- l don’t know, maybe on a ship nearby.
- Underwater ?

238
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:35,396
Who knows ? Teyla’s spidey sense
works for miles.

239
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:38,365
- Are the external sensors up ?
- Yes, they’re operational.

240
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:40,518
- They’re to scan the ocean.
- Doesn’t matter.

241
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:44,362
Coleman, look at the drilling platform’s
external sensors. See what you turn up.

242
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:47,121
- What am l looking for ?
- Anything.

243
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:51,919
How are you feeling ?

244
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:54,360
l’ve never been more ashamed.

245
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:59,196
- Oh, you can’t blame yourself.
- l should have been more careful.

246
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,765
A Wraith Queen’s mind
is extremely powerful, Teyla.

247
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:06,725
- You know that better than l do.
- Still.

248
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:11,478
If my actions while under her control
result in people getting hurt...

249
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,760
If you hadn’t done what you did...

250
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:19,317
... who knows
what could’ve happened.

251
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:24,515
At least now we know
what we’re dealing with.

252
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:28,677
If anything, l should thank you.
l certainly don’t blame you.

253
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:31,079
l would like to help them find her.

254
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:33,205
- Teyla.
- There is no risk.

255
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,164
l don’t know that.

256
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:40,004
Unless you suspect l am still
under her control even now ?

257
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:44,001
Would l be alone with you if l did ?

258
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:49,243
Then you think
l am somehow vulnerable to her ?

259
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:55,203
l think it is best to keep you away
from her for the moment, yes.

260
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:58,686
Look, l don’t fully understand
this capability you have...

261
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,078
... of linking with a Wraith mind,
but if it’s even remotely possible--

262
00:20:02,247 --> 00:20:06,843
She was only able to control me
because l opened my mind to her.

263
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:14,316
If l choose to do so again...

264
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:16,406
... l will be ready.

265
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:19,798
- Teyla, l know you wanna help.
- l do.

266
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:24,480
The best way for you to do that is allow
Ronon and Colonel Sheppard to find her.

267
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,198
As you wish.

268
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,317
It’s about time. l was beginning
to think you had gotten lost.

269
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,757
Listen, did you manage to-- ?

270
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:12,565
Colonel Sheppard.

271
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:14,640
If you can hear me...

272
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,206
... please.

273
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:17,595
<i>Help me--</i>

274
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:20,327
Who am l talking to ?

275
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,557
What’s your location ?

276
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:24,596
McKay ?

277
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,723
<i>Do you have any men</i>
<i>unaccounted for ?</i>

278
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:28,718
Two guys l just sent back
to the Jumper.

279
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:32,118
l think they’re in trouble.
Can you get those force fields down ?

280
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:35,000
We’re working on it.

281
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:40,562
The Wraith presence
is even stronger than before.

282
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:42,843
She is aboard this station.
You must warn them.

283
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:46,920
Colonel Sheppard, Teyla is certain
the Wraith is aboard the station.

284
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:48,566
<i>Understood.</i>

285
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,321
Ronon, l’m heading back
to the Jumper. Meet me there.

286
00:21:51,487 --> 00:21:52,886
l’m on my way.

287
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:59,720
<i>Sheppard, help me. Please.</i>

288
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:02,598
McKay.

289
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:08,718
McKay.

290
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:10,366
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, almost there.</i>

291
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,883
l can only do one at a time.

292
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:22,401
The Jumper’s sensors
should be able to locate them.

293
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,000
Graydon ?

294
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:49,601
Graydon’s dead.

295
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:53,238
<i>-Fed upon.</i>
- What about Dickenson ?

296
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:55,284
<i>There’s no sign of him yet.</i>

297
00:22:56,327 --> 00:22:59,524
See if we can find him using the...

298
00:23:01,887 --> 00:23:03,957
Sheppard ?

299
00:23:04,127 --> 00:23:05,276
Sheppard, come in.

300
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:17,606
You are Sheppard.

301
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:21,040
The one who can fly this ship.

302
00:23:21,887 --> 00:23:24,276
You will return me to the surface.

303
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:27,563
Kneel.

304
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:34,919
<i>Sheppard, this is mcKay.</i>
<i>What have you got ?</i>

305
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:37,359
<i>Sheppard, can you hear me ?</i>

306
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:44,718
Is something wrong ?

307
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:49,601
You will fly me to the stargate...

308
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:52,238
... and return me to my people.

309
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:08,718
<i>Sheppard, this is mcKay.</i>
<i>Please respond. Sheppard, come in.</i>

310
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,997
l’m here.

311
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,437
We had to throw the emergency
force fields up.

312
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:17,041
- The section you were in was flooding.
- l noticed.

313
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:20,722
You were thrown by the force of the
water clear of the force field bulkhead.

314
00:24:20,887 --> 00:24:22,718
Ronon ?

315
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:41,436
l missed.

316
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:44,526
l noticed that too.

317
00:24:44,687 --> 00:24:48,646
<i>Everyone else is accounted for.</i>
<i>Any sign of Dickenson ?</i>

318
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,602
Stand by, McKay.

319
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:59,881
Look, l don’t know what just happened,
but we are now cut off from the Jumper.

320
00:25:00,087 --> 00:25:02,123
- l won’t miss now.
- Wait.

321
00:25:02,287 --> 00:25:04,084
What for ?

322
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:07,836
Well, we lost the Jumper and we lost
communications with Atlantis.

323
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,043
Maybe she can help us
get out of this place.

324
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:20,756
Welcome back.

325
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:26,997
l trust you’re comfortable ?

326
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:32,079
That groggy sensation you’re feeling are
the sedatives we’re pumping you full of.

327
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:34,238
Just a precaution.

328
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,921
As for the other precautions...

329
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:47,240
Now, you’re gonna tell us everything
we want to know.

330
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:49,645
In exchange for ?

331
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:53,122
This is not a negotiation.

332
00:25:54,247 --> 00:25:56,283
l disagree.

333
00:25:56,447 --> 00:25:58,324
Let me get this over with.

334
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:17,805
How did you get aboard this station ?

335
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:23,562
Are there any more of you ?

336
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:30,199
You are all about to die.

337
00:26:30,607 --> 00:26:32,086
Really ?

338
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:34,886
You care to elaborate on that at all ?

339
00:26:43,127 --> 00:26:46,483
We should keep the force fields up till
Atlantis sends a rescue Jumper.

340
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,524
Station communications
are still down--

341
00:26:48,687 --> 00:26:50,723
If l’d listened to Teyla,
this wouldn’t have happened.

342
00:26:50,887 --> 00:26:53,765
- It’s not your fault.
- l sent those men back to the Jumper.

343
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:56,646
Well, the sensors indicated that
there was nobody here.

344
00:26:56,807 --> 00:27:00,197
l don’t think there was, sir. The Wraith
arrived after we did the scans.

345
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:01,595
- What ?
- l did a search...

346
00:27:01,807 --> 00:27:04,275
... with the remote sensors.
l found something.

347
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:08,402
We didn’t notice it on the way down
because it’s radiating very little EM.

348
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:12,202
Guys, head back here.
l think l have a few answers.

349
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:20,245
- A Wraith cruiser ?
- Seems completely buried in silt.

350
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:23,439
Which means it’s been here
a very, very, very long time.

351
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:27,998
- Yes, give or take a very.
- That doesn’t explain how she got here.

352
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:33,517
- Maybe she swam over.
- No, no. The pressure at that depth is--

353
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:36,121
Deadly to humans,
but she’s not human, remember ?

354
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:40,360
Yes, it’s difficult to imagine, but with
a Wraith’s ability to heal itself...

355
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:49,004
- And there are no other Wraith onboard ?
- No way to know for sure.

356
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:52,916
Our prisoner isn’t talking.
Other than,« ou » ?You’re all about to die. »

357
00:27:53,127 --> 00:27:56,039
Which may or may not
be an empty threat.

358
00:27:56,327 --> 00:27:59,922
- And you have no way of knowing ?
- She said it with a lot of confidence.

359
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:04,364
- There is a way to find out.
- We’ve already been down that road.

360
00:28:04,527 --> 00:28:06,916
What is to stop her asserting
control over you again ?

361
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:09,043
She is heavily sedated.

362
00:28:09,447 --> 00:28:12,405
And this time, l know exactly
what l’m dealing with.

363
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:28,799
You.

364
00:28:30,327 --> 00:28:32,283
l was caught off-guard the first time.

365
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:34,246
That will not happen again.

366
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,799
It does not matter.

367
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,003
Well, we think it does.

368
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:41,887
Your fate is sealed.

369
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:47,526
If you have any reason to suspect
that l’m not myself...

370
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:49,723
... do not hesitate to use that.

371
00:28:49,887 --> 00:28:50,922
l won’t.

372
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:06,596
l see her...

373
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:13,362
<i>... leading the first wave of ships that</i>
<i>attacked Atlantis during the war.</i>

374
00:29:13,927 --> 00:29:16,680
Queen of a great alliance.

375
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:21,121
Her ship was damaged
during the battle.

376
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:25,278
It crashed into the ocean.

377
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:29,319
She fed upon
her own crew to survive.

378
00:29:29,487 --> 00:29:32,559
Too deep to ever swim to the surface.

379
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:36,197
Waking between centuries...

380
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:40,084
... waiting for rescue
that never came...

381
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:44,282
... until finally she was alone.

382
00:29:46,727 --> 00:29:49,958
<i>She sensed our presence</i>
<i>during our descent.</i>

383
00:29:51,047 --> 00:29:52,719
<i>She sensed...</i>

384
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:54,966
... me.

385
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:59,566
<i>And saw us as her one chance</i>
<i>at freedom from her prison.</i>

386
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:05,085
<i>The water was crushing...</i>

387
00:30:06,207 --> 00:30:07,481
... but she was determined.

388
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:12,438
Finally, after all these millennia,
a ship.

389
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:15,478
<i>But she did not possess the gene</i>
<i>to fly it.</i>

390
00:30:18,647 --> 00:30:20,922
She used Dickenson to call for me.

391
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:32,716
Teyla ?

392
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:36,404
- You are all about to die.
- That does not sound like Teyla.

393
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,478
You are all about to die.

394
00:30:38,647 --> 00:30:39,921
You are all about to die.

395
00:30:40,087 --> 00:30:42,920
- Teyla, snap out of it.
- Wait.

396
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:52,196
She has activated the self-destruct
device of the Wraith cruiser.

397
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:55,086
It is set to detonate within two hours.

398
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:01,955
So not an empty threat.

399
00:31:17,247 --> 00:31:18,600
- How’s Teyla ?
- She’s resting.

400
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:20,883
It took more out of her
than she’Il admit.

401
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:23,242
- What’s the news ?
- It looks like the Ancients...

402
00:31:23,407 --> 00:31:25,762
... chose this section
because the planet’s crust...

403
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,645
... is remarkably thin below us...

404
00:31:27,807 --> 00:31:31,402
... allowing to drill into the magma and
maximize the geothermal power output.

405
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:33,478
- Okay.
- Which means there’s a great deal...

406
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:36,036
... of potential energy directly
beneath this station.

407
00:31:36,207 --> 00:31:38,596
That’s the news ? That this place
works as advertised ?

408
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:41,406
No, no, the news is that
if they were to detonate, say...

409
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:44,843
... the self-destruct of a Wraith cruiser
on such a wafer-thin crust...

410
00:31:45,047 --> 00:31:47,117
- Oh, my God.
- All that thermal energy...

411
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:50,000
... directly beneath us
will be released all at once.

412
00:31:50,207 --> 00:31:52,243
So bad news.

413
00:31:52,407 --> 00:31:54,637
The explosion will be magnified a
thousand times.

414
00:31:54,807 --> 00:31:57,446
- We’re talking catastrophic.
- So it won’t just be us.

415
00:31:57,607 --> 00:32:00,838
No, Atlantis will be affected as well.
It’s within the blast radius.

416
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:03,760
- We have no way to warn them ?
- They’d never see it coming.

417
00:32:03,927 --> 00:32:05,997
So we disarm the self-destruct.

418
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:09,000
- That’s brilliant, we need to get there.
- Without the Jumper ?

419
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,681
We’re behind schedule.
They’Il send a rescue Jumper.

420
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,236
Even if they’ve left,
the moment we were overdue--

421
00:32:14,407 --> 00:32:16,921
- They won’t make it in time.
- How far is the cruiser ?

422
00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:23,197
- Less than a kilometer.
- She swam that far ?

423
00:32:23,367 --> 00:32:26,916
- What is she ?
- A formidable enemy.

424
00:32:27,087 --> 00:32:28,759
l have an idea.

425
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:32,436
l found these in the database
when we first got here.

426
00:32:32,607 --> 00:32:35,758
They were used to make
repairs to the exterior of the station.

427
00:32:35,927 --> 00:32:39,715
- Very cool.
- You’Il be able to traverse the distance.

428
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:43,846
- You mean we.
- Yes, of course. We.

429
00:32:45,207 --> 00:32:47,198
This must be how she got in.

430
00:32:47,407 --> 00:32:49,204
Probably.

431
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,803
All right, let’s get suited up.

432
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:56,079
Right.

433
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:01,965
You’re breathing too hard.

434
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:05,280
Forgive me for being aware of exactly
how much pressure...

435
00:33:05,447 --> 00:33:07,403
... is being exerted on this suit
right now.

436
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:10,798
Just think of it as a walk
on the beach.

437
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:13,720
A beach that’s about to explode.

438
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:16,163
That’s supposed
to make me feel better ?

439
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:20,197
No, it’s supposed to make you walk
faster. We’re on a clock here.

440
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:22,159
<i>This is Weir. How close are you ?</i>

441
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,359
Almost there, but we’re running
out of time.

442
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:29,037
We need Teyla to do her
Kreskin act again.

443
00:33:30,087 --> 00:33:33,477
l’d rather not have to. l think it could be
much too dangerous for her.

444
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:36,042
So is exploding magma.

445
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:40,442
l am walking as fast as l can.

446
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:44,286
How do we disarm the self-destruct ?

447
00:33:44,727 --> 00:33:47,525
You won’t survive the blast
any more than we will.

448
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:52,762
l can get the information we need.

449
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:55,401
If you were strong enough...

450
00:33:55,607 --> 00:33:58,599
... you would have done so already.

451
00:34:00,927 --> 00:34:04,442
l can feel how weak you are.

452
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:07,241
We shall see who is stronger.

453
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:21,843
- That took too long.
- Yeah, well...

454
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:26,484
... l probably won’t be able to disarm the
self-destruct in time, we’re not in a rush.

455
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,797
Why don’t we find it,
then you can be negative ?

456
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,559
This ship is remarkably preserved.

457
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:33,161
You’d think after 10,000 years
she’d wanna redecorate.

458
00:34:33,327 --> 00:34:36,797
l’m serious. Hull damage is minimal.
They probably lost their main drive.

459
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:38,844
You’re saying this is salvageable ?

460
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:42,522
l have to assess damage to primary
systems, but it’s not out of the question.

461
00:34:42,687 --> 00:34:45,997
You’d just go and blow it up or slam it
into a hive ship or something...

462
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,397
... and all that work
would be for nothing.

463
00:34:49,127 --> 00:34:50,640
This way.

464
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:04,205
Teyla ?

465
00:35:06,927 --> 00:35:08,883
You are weakening.

466
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:10,275
l think you should stop.

467
00:35:10,447 --> 00:35:12,438
My concentration slipped
for a moment.

468
00:35:12,607 --> 00:35:15,679
And in that moment, l could have
crushed you with a single thought.

469
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:21,515
Perhaps next time, l will.

470
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:24,076
- There isn’t gonna be a next time.
- l’m fine.

471
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,080
No, you’re not. l can see
what this is doing to you.

472
00:35:27,247 --> 00:35:29,886
Let’s just give McKay a chance.

473
00:35:33,687 --> 00:35:35,484
There it is.

474
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,366
What ?

475
00:35:40,727 --> 00:35:44,242
l’m sure this is the device, l’m sure
it says we have less than half an hour.

476
00:35:44,407 --> 00:35:46,238
So turn it off.

477
00:35:52,247 --> 00:35:54,681
- What does that mean ?
- It’s not accepting commands.

478
00:35:54,847 --> 00:35:56,883
There must be some kind
of a command code...

479
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:59,436
- ... that needs to be entered.
- Can you figure it out ?

480
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:02,599
Command codes are simple like the
number one or the letter A...

481
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:05,804
- ... like, in Wraith, which would be--
- Can you figure it out or not ?

482
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:08,083
Not if l stood and tried
for a million years...

483
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:11,398
... and we have just under
a million years less than that.

484
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:13,643
Élizabeth, you there ?

485
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:15,841
Any luck ?

486
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:18,038
<i>Negative. We don’t get her</i>
<i>command code...</i>

487
00:36:18,247 --> 00:36:21,364
... in less than 30 minutes,
we’re dead.

488
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:28,604
- This is the only way.
- l told you, Rodney has another idea.

489
00:36:28,807 --> 00:36:32,243
That may or may not succeed.
There is only one way to be certain.

490
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:34,557
She said she would kill you next time.

491
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,803
l will not let that happen.

492
00:36:37,647 --> 00:36:40,957
No. We’re gonna give them
more time.

493
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:49,716
Ronon.

494
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,079
There’s an emergency in the control
room. Dr. Weir needs your help.

495
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:54,566
What about her ?

496
00:36:54,727 --> 00:36:56,763
l will watch the prisoner. Hurry.

497
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:58,764
Watch yourself.

498
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:05,362
Are you fool enough to try again ?

499
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,520
l have very little to lose.

500
00:37:52,287 --> 00:37:55,723
You are trying to hide something
from me.

501
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:01,605
<i>There’s been a development.</i>

502
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:03,803
You’ve been able to disarm
the self-destruct ?

503
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:07,437
No, but Rodney thinks if he can tie in
a Naquadah generator...

504
00:38:07,607 --> 00:38:10,565
- ... he can get the cruiser to fly.
- After all these years ?

505
00:38:10,727 --> 00:38:12,957
Damage was superficial.
Problem was the engines.

506
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:15,118
McKay’s restored power and l think...

507
00:38:15,287 --> 00:38:18,324
- ... l can fly the ship to a distance.
- That’s a suicide mission.

508
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:22,366
If l can ditch the ship on the mainland,
maybe l can get far enough away.

509
00:38:22,527 --> 00:38:23,960
- l gotta go now.
- Wait.

510
00:38:24,127 --> 00:38:26,721
Let me try again. If l can get her to give
up her code...

511
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,084
- ... you won’t have to risk it.
- You’re in no condition to do that.

512
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:32,480
Sorry.

513
00:39:01,527 --> 00:39:02,880
Well.

514
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:05,681
You’re a hell of a swimmer,
l’Il give you that.

515
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:08,640
You have restored power ?

516
00:39:08,927 --> 00:39:10,645
It’Il fly.

517
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:22,962
You shall be rewarded
with a quick death.

518
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:31,203
She’s not dying
according to plan here.

519
00:39:38,447 --> 00:39:40,039
l thought you’d forgotten about me.

520
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:42,482
l just had to wait for her
to disable the device.

521
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:46,162
Be thankful she didn’t feed on you
before she entered the command code.

522
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:48,318
- That’s why you didn’t wanna be bait.
- No...

523
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:51,604
... you had to be bait because she was
expecting you to fly the ship.

524
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:59,044
- She is dead, right ?
- Let’s get out of here.

525
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:12,884
How are you feeling ?

526
00:40:13,127 --> 00:40:17,359
Much better, now that l no longer
feel the constant presence of a Wraith.

527
00:40:17,607 --> 00:40:21,156
That was no ordinary Wraith. It took
a lot of bullets to take her down.

528
00:40:21,527 --> 00:40:22,596
l wish l was there.

529
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:27,966
He’s right, you know. l mean, deceiving
a Wraith Queen ? That’s no small feat.

530
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:31,523
When there are so many lives at stake,
it’s easy to summon the strength.

531
00:40:31,687 --> 00:40:35,202
Well, Zelenka’s finally got
communications back up.

532
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:37,881
Turns out Atlantis
had sent another Jumper.

533
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:40,681
- It should be here within the hour.
- That’s good news.

534
00:40:40,887 --> 00:40:43,037
Yeah, no kidding.
l can’t wait to see the sun.

535
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,596
We haven’t finished what we came for.
Wraith’s gone.

536
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:46,916
We got a ton of research.

537
00:40:47,087 --> 00:40:49,726
- Yes, we do.
- In fact, l’m sure we should be able...

538
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:53,675
... to come up with a way to get auxiliary
power online in a couple of days.

539
00:40:54,527 --> 00:40:55,676
Is he serious ?

540
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:58,526
- Yeah, he is.
- Well, l for one...

541
00:40:58,687 --> 00:41:01,804
... intend to spend
the next little while resting.

542
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:03,475
Same here.

543
00:41:03,687 --> 00:41:06,838
Yeah. Same here.
