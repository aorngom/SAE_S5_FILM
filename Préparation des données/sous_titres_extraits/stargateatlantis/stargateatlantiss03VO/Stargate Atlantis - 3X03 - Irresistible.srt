0
00:00:07,127 --> 00:00:08,924
Are you all right, colonel ?

1
00:00:09,127 --> 00:00:12,005
It’s nothing, just a cold. No big deal.
Just annoying.

2
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:14,045
- Talk about annoying...
- What ?

3
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:16,402
We should be focusing
on harvesting space gates.

4
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:20,082
That’s what we’re doing, Rodney.
The M.A.L.P. detected life signs.

5
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,437
We have to check it out.
That’s the protocol.

6
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:26,117
Identifying space gates to complete
the intergalactic bridge...

7
00:00:26,287 --> 00:00:28,482
... should be our priority,
not making contact...

8
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:30,558
... with the locals
of a backwater hamlet.

9
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:33,645
- Are you that eager to return to Earth ?
- This isn’t about me.

10
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:37,442
It’s the ability to go back and forth
between Earth and Atlantis conveniently.

11
00:00:37,607 --> 00:00:39,916
- And whenever l want to.
- How’s that work, again ?

12
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:41,236
Okay.

13
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:44,683
Once we’ve seeded enough stargates
between Pegasus and the Milky Way...

14
00:00:44,847 --> 00:00:48,840
... we’Il take a Jumper from one
to the other till we reach the other side.

15
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,840
We won’t tax the ZPM,
we won’t be reliant on the <i>Daedalus.</i>

16
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:54,396
Travel time between Earth and Atlantis
will be cut...

17
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:56,683
... from three weeks to 30 minutes.

18
00:00:57,087 --> 00:00:58,566
- Very clever.
- Yes.

19
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:00,879
It was Samantha Carter’s idea.

20
00:01:01,247 --> 00:01:03,556
Backwater hamlet, dead ahead.

21
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:22,320
Okay, let’s just make contact,
buy our souvenirs and get out of here.

22
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:24,320
Fair day to you.

23
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:26,876
Fair day to you.

24
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,604
Nothing here. We should probably go.

25
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:34,203
Yeah, probably wouldn’t hurt
to make contact with the locals, though.

26
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:36,881
- No, when you’re right, you’re right.
- We’re here now--

27
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:41,518
Hello. Hello, new people. Why didn’t
anybody tell me they were here yet ?

28
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:44,440
- Lucius, l’ve missed you.
- Willa, l was just out for a walk.

29
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:47,201
- Have you met the new people yet ?
- We just got here.

30
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:50,564
Oh, great. Then l haven’t missed
anything. l hate missing things.

31
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:53,605
Have you met my wife Willa ?
Isn’t she gorgeous ?

32
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:55,997
My other wives,
they’re just making lunch.

33
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,520
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Hello.

34
00:01:58,127 --> 00:02:00,243
l love you. l love you.
Fair day, everybody.

35
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:01,681
Fair day, Lucius.

36
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:05,078
l’m John Sheppard.
Rodney McKay.

37
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:08,000
Ronon Dex, Teyla Emmagan.

38
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:10,198
Teyla.

39
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:13,279
- And you are from. . ?
- Athos.

40
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:16,081
Athos. Yeah, Athos.
l’ve never been there.

41
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:18,084
Sounds nice. Is it nice ?

42
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:20,324
Until it was culled by the Wraith.

43
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:22,438
Oh, l hate them.

44
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:26,316
What do you say you and me
get together, have lunch, talk about this ?

45
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:27,556
Maybe have some wine ?

46
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:29,844
We don’t even know your name.

47
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:39,361
We’re serious.

48
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:43,005
You mean you truly
have not heard of Lucius ?

49
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:44,766
Well, everyone knows.

50
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:48,166
He’s the wisest and kindest man
among the stars.

51
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:50,039
Oh, people just say that.

52
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:53,517
l mean, you can’t prove it
till you’ve met everybody, am l right ?

53
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:56,959
Well, then, Lucius...

54
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:58,276
... we’re glad we met you.

55
00:02:58,487 --> 00:03:02,958
And if you aren’t yet, you will be.
Come on, let’s have some lunch, huh ?

56
00:03:03,127 --> 00:03:05,595
Everybody has to eat.
Come on. Right this way, please.

57
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:08,201
Please. After you. Please.

58
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:12,046
- Fair day.
- Fair day, Lucius.

59
00:03:12,487 --> 00:03:15,638
- Fair day. Fair day.
- Fair day.

60
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:22,638
Here l come.

61
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,322
l love architecture.
It’s all a mystery to me, really...

62
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,684
- ... but hasn’t stopped me from trying.
- l see.

63
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:34,963
- Is she taken yet ?
- No.

64
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,681
Nor does he, nor anyone else,
speak for me.

65
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:39,036
Oh, yeah.

66
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:41,323
Yeah, you are definitely
wife material.

67
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:44,041
Yeah, l love a woman with spirit.

68
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:45,276
And a great body.

69
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:47,799
Excuse me, Lucius.

70
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:50,356
Please pardon my ignorance,
possibly even my manners.

71
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:52,085
- What is it about you-- ?
- l know...

72
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:54,278
... so you don’t even have to ask.

73
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:56,200
l have gifts.

74
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:03,039
What are those gifts ?

75
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:05,285
Exploration.

76
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:07,085
Alchemy, medicine.

77
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:10,040
l have, l have to say,
some of the best ointments around.

78
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:14,482
See, l could take care of that
just like that.

79
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:16,484
- It’s just a cold.
- Nevertheless.

80
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:19,997
l have a potion that could
get rid of that in six or seven days.

81
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:23,842
- That’s impressive.
- You get used to it. We’Il do a trade.

82
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:26,083
So where y’all from ?

83
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:28,363
No place in particular.
We move around a lot.

84
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:31,246
In that wonderful machine.
Yeah, l saw it. l was on a walk.

85
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:36,117
l look up and l heard-- Somebody said
that you flew through the ancestral ring ?

86
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:37,396
Yeah, that was us.

87
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:39,199
How does it fly ?

88
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:42,564
- It’s complicated. One has to--
- Where do you get a machine like that ?

89
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:46,356
l mean, it’s a wonderful way to travel.
Can l get one ? Are they hard to fly ?

90
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:50,440
Yes, they are hard to fly,
and no, you can’t have one.

91
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:53,636
But l want one.

92
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,845
Please.

93
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:58,005
Sorry.

94
00:05:58,327 --> 00:06:01,205
Well, perhaps a trade for some of
his wonderful medicines ?

95
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:03,602
- Or perhaps not.
- What ? You come all this way...

96
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:05,439
... you don’t even wanna do a trade ?

97
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:07,916
Doesn’t have to be the ship.
l don’t want it.

98
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:09,998
You gotta have some other stuff
to trade.

99
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:13,045
Okay, like, how do you get your hair
to go like that ?

100
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:21,116
Lunch was great, but l just realized
we’re running late.

101
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:24,444
- For what ?
- For that important thing.

102
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:27,081
Yes, as much as we’d love
to stay, we really must go.

103
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,397
No. l don’t want you to go.
You just got here.

104
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,285
We haven’t had the second course.

105
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:33,318
Please, l want you to see
my medicines.

106
00:06:33,487 --> 00:06:35,921
Go get the ointments, the good ones.
Go. Run. Go.

107
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:38,322
- Another time, Lucius. We gotta go.
- No.

108
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:39,960
No, l don’t want you to leave.

109
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,398
Okay, okay, okay.

110
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,639
All right. Let them go.

111
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,759
We’re all friends here, right ?

112
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:56,756
Tell you what. Soon as we get back,
we’Il tell our medical people...

113
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:59,999
... to come see what you have to offer,
then we’Il talk about trade.

114
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:01,805
- Later today, maybe ?
- Maybe.

115
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:03,923
- l’Il have everything ready.
- Thank you.

116
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:05,315
You won’t be disappointed.

117
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:10,478
Nice people.

118
00:07:12,887 --> 00:07:15,959
- l think the word we’re looking for is--
- Obnoxious ? Unctuous ?

119
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:17,480
Either one of those works.

120
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:20,684
The townspeople seem to love him.
There may be something to his medicine.

121
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:24,556
Sounds like snake oil to me, but might
be worth having Beckett check out.

122
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:27,241
l’m sure Carson will be able
to get us an answer soon.

123
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:29,921
- So it’s back out to scout for gates ?
- Yes. Right away.

124
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:32,203
It’s not a race, Rodney.

125
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:36,475
Some of the herbs were gathered
from this planet...

126
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:40,083
... but most were collected from
my many excursions to other worlds.

127
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:41,965
l have to confess...

128
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:46,245
... l have concocted remedies
for almost every known ailment.

129
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:49,763
- Every single one ?
- Well, every one in town.

130
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:51,645
The sick have been cured.

131
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,684
The lame can walk again.

132
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:58,403
Well, some still crawl, but they crawl
a lot faster than they used to.

133
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:01,277
- l see.
- Nothing pleases me more...

134
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,484
... than when someone comes up to me,
they say,« ou » ?Thank you, Lucius.

135
00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:08,356
You have cured me.
You are a wise and kind man. »

136
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,525
Young, old, women.

137
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,637
Do you like women, Dr. Beckett ?

138
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:19,198
What ? Yes, of course.

139
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:21,045
Yeah, l have a potion...

140
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:24,597
... that will have them lined up,
just waiting to be with you.

141
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:25,802
You know what l mean...

142
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:28,481
- ... when l say « be with you, » right ?
- l think so, yes.

143
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:30,359
l will trade you that potion...

144
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:33,087
... for what you are holding
in your bag right now.

145
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,398
My medical kit ?

146
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:39,764
l thought you cured
every known ailment.

147
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:42,481
Every known ailment in town.
l added that, remember ?

148
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:49,363
Well, it is tempting, but l’m afraid
l couldn’t do that, Lucius. Sorry.

149
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:51,196
Not yet, anyway, huh ?

150
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:53,286
Come on. You must be starving.

151
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:56,126
l have a great meal lined up for us.

152
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:01,838
How did the scout go ?

153
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:06,920
Well, we found an unused gate
in orbit over M3R-428.

154
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:09,920
One lousy gate. We’re never
gonna meet our quota at this rate.

155
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:12,516
- What quota ?
- My quota.

156
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:14,598
<i>Daedalus</i> is still under repair, Rodney.

157
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:17,201
We won’t be able to harvest gates
till it can fly.

158
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:20,445
Did Beckett bring back
anything worth anything ?

159
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:22,080
No, he hasn’t returned yet.

160
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:24,887
He radioed in earlier,
said he’d like to stay longer.

161
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:27,356
Apparently he’s found
something of interest.

162
00:09:28,287 --> 00:09:30,847
The baby was frozen solid.

163
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:32,838
Like a statue.

164
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:35,680
Like a frozen statue.

165
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:38,156
It must have been in the water for,
l don’t know...

166
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,444
... what seemed like an eternity.
l didn’t know what to do.

167
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:43,916
You know, l was a kid myself.

168
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:45,679
l take the baby...

169
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:49,635
... and l open my coat
and l tuck the baby inside.

170
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:53,117
And l start stroking the baby’s back.

171
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:55,118
Gently.

172
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,558
Now, l don’t know...

173
00:09:57,727 --> 00:10:00,116
... whether it was the warmth
of my body...

174
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:05,202
... or the steady, insistent rhythm
of my own life force...

175
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:10,238
... urging this tiny baby’s heart
to begin beating again...

176
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:13,562
... but beat it did.

177
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,163
And a cry arose...

178
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:19,325
... piercing the cold night air...

179
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:21,922
... as if to say...

180
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:27,158
...« ou » ?l am alive. »

181
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:33,446
Astonishing.

182
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:34,756
And that baby...

183
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:39,640
That baby grew up to be...

184
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,283
That beautiful young lady.

185
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:45,762
No, no, not her, not her. Behind her.

186
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:52,446
Maybe a little brain-damaged,
but just a little, but the story is true.

187
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:55,525
And thank you for sharing it with me.

188
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:57,843
Oh, please, Dr. Beckett.

189
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,998
That’s what l like doing most :

190
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:01,998
To share.

191
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,124
To share me.

192
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:06,955
And l can see that now.

193
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:09,357
You see ? All you had to do
was get to know me.

194
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:10,926
You know, Carson--

195
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,759
- May l call you Carson ?
- Of course.

196
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:15,316
This city that you keep
going on and on about--

197
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:16,886
- Atlantis.
- Yeah, Atlantis.

198
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:19,880
On a scale of one to 10,
this village being a three--

199
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,799
Oh, Atlantis is definitely a 10.

200
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:23,116
- It is ?
- Oh, yeah.

201
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:25,522
And those flying ships,
you still have those ?

202
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:27,405
You mean the Jumpers ?
We have several.

203
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,525
Oh, yeah. How interesting.
Tell me more.

204
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,362
Ach, Lucius, l think l could do
much better than that.

205
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:36,636
Incoming wormhole.

206
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:40,357
Opening the shield.
Dr. Beckett’s IDC.

207
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:42,358
It’s about time.

208
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:46,684
Carson.

209
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:55,236
Oh, my ! When you said
this place was a 10...

210
00:11:55,407 --> 00:12:00,242
... l thought,« ou » ?Okay, maybe it’s an eight
and a half, » but this...

211
00:12:00,407 --> 00:12:02,557
- Carson ?
- Oh, Dr. Weir...

212
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:05,884
... permit me
to introduce Lucius Luvin.

213
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:09,006
Speaking of stunning...

214
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:11,883
You never told me anything about her.

215
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:15,799
Oh, yeah. Yeah...

216
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:18,202
... l am definitely gonna like it here.

217
00:12:22,287 --> 00:12:24,926
l can’t believe you brought him here
without permission.

218
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:28,124
- l didn’t think you’d mind.
- You didn’t think l’d mind ?

219
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,563
You know the protocols.
You even helped come up with them.

220
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:33,365
There’s so much he can offer us.

221
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:36,246
This the same guy who said
he could cure my cold in a week ?

222
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,125
l know my business, Colonel Sheppard.

223
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:41,563
He happens to have created several
medicines that are quite remarkable.

224
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,605
- Really ? That guy ?
- Aye.

225
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:48,077
He also possesses many valuable herbs
and spices and gourds.

226
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:51,479
- Did you just say gourds ?
- Yes, Rodney, gourds.

227
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,605
We don’t know everything,
despite what you may think.

228
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:58,039
He could prove
to be a very powerful ally.

229
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:00,517
He’s a very wise and kind man.

230
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:04,285
Are you feeling all right ?

231
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:06,080
What do you mean ?

232
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:09,683
- It’s just, you’re acting a little...
- Smitten ?

233
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:12,077
l had another word in mind.

234
00:13:12,287 --> 00:13:14,960
- This is not something to treat lightly.
- No, it isn’t.

235
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:17,556
You’ve brought a stranger
without prior approval.

236
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:20,366
Now he knows about the city,
as well as our gate address.

237
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,637
Lucius would do nothing to harm us.

238
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:26,404
He comes in peace. As our friend.

239
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:29,365
You have his word and mine on that.

240
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:35,686
- Do you think he poses a threat ?
- Definitely a nuisance.

241
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:38,998
If what Beckett says is correct,
these medicines could be of value.

242
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,681
Just keep an eye on him.
McKay and l are heading out.

243
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:45,760
Tell Teyla and Ronon not to let him
out of their sight.

244
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:51,405
Here we are.

245
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:57,957
It’s perfect.

246
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:02,320
Because you could have
my personal quarters if you wanted.

247
00:14:02,527 --> 00:14:06,725
Oh, no, no. Don’t be silly, Carson.
l mean, you know...

248
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,720
... l’Il take a look at what you have,
if you insist...

249
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:11,445
... but this’Il do fine for now.

250
00:14:11,607 --> 00:14:15,520
Oh, good. l’m so pleased.
Just let me know if you want anything.

251
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:18,525
l can’t think of anything l want more
than just being here.

252
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:22,278
Except that--

253
00:14:24,287 --> 00:14:25,561
What ?

254
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:27,843
- No, it’s nothing.
- No, tell me.

255
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:31,763
Well, l get the feeling that your friends
don’t like having me around.

256
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:35,243
Oh, Lucius. Just give them a chance
to get to know you.

257
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,683
- Well, l just hope l get that chance.
- Oh, you will, l promise.

258
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,997
l’m sure Dr. Weir
will want to negotiate...

259
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,317
... an alliance between
your people and ours.

260
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:44,681
- Really ?
- Really.

261
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:46,924
Oh, that’d be great.

262
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,637
Hello. l was gonna go get
something to eat.

263
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:57,117
They forgot to bring me something.
Are you guys not allowed to talk ?

264
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,642
Guests are not permitted
to move about unescorted.

265
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:01,957
Well, what do you say
you escort me, then ?

266
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,998
- You don’t like me yet, do you ?
- Yet ?

267
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,600
l’m sorry. My manners fail...

268
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:08,486
... when l am in the presence
of a beautiful woman.

269
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:10,996
- Isn’t she something, huh ?
- Yeah.

270
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,601
- We will have something sent to you.
- Oh, no. Come on.

271
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:16,520
- Don’t make me sit all alone. Please ?
- We’Il both take you.

272
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:19,759
Both. Both is good. Yeah, we’Il get
to know each other, then, okay ?

273
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:22,686
Like, how do you get your hair
to go like that ?

274
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:26,359
Just listen to what he has to say.

275
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:29,405
Thank you. Fine. l must say,
l’m starting to get concerned...

276
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,842
... about your interest in this man.
It seems...

277
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:33,042
... excessive.

278
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:36,756
And l find it puzzling why you’ve chosen
to greet Lucius with such hostility.

279
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:39,441
Perhaps it’s because
you broke protocol, endangering--

280
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:43,122
And for that, l am sorry, but can we
please move on past that one mistake...

281
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:46,359
... and not further alienate
a potential ally ?

282
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:49,925
Fine.

283
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:51,759
Have him come up to my office.

284
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:57,322
Hello, Dr. Weir.

285
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:04,922
Hello, Dr. Weir. Yeah.

286
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:27,125
Hello, Dr. Weir. Thank you
for granting me this audience.

287
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,720
It’s hardly that, Mr. Luvin.

288
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,321
No, please. Lucius.

289
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,163
May this be the first of many gifts...

290
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:39,321
... that our people exchange.

291
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:41,201
Thank you.

292
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:42,442
l made it myself.

293
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,687
The gourd is from the marshes
of my home world...

294
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:49,123
... topped with a candle that’s made
from the congealed tallow...

295
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:50,636
... of an animal...

296
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:53,566
... that l killed with my bare hands.

297
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:57,762
How nice.

298
00:16:58,087 --> 00:16:59,281
It’s nothing.

299
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:02,081
- Please, have a seat.
- After you.

300
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:11,756
What are you doing ?

301
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,160
l was told that you’d like to negotiate
an alliance between our two peoples.

302
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:23,156
An alliance ? Okay. Sure.

303
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:25,318
That’s why l’m here,
is to talk about that.

304
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:30,717
Well, then, why don’t you start
by telling me what you have to offer us ?

305
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,203
Besides candles.

306
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:39,159
Right.

307
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:42,485
One tiny settlement
on the entire planet ?

308
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,917
Look, all we’d have to do
is relocate them.

309
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:49,126
We’re not evacuating an entire planet
so we can take their gate.

310
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:51,847
Hey. Welcome back.

311
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:53,759
Where’s Zelenka ?

312
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:56,322
- Well, he’s not here.
- No.

313
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:58,398
No one’s here.

314
00:17:58,887 --> 00:18:00,206
Where is everyone ?

315
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:04,682
l’m standing outside.
l don’t know what to do.

316
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:07,640
l ran. l ran. l ran.

317
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,446
And, mind you, l’m the guy
who’s holding the weapon, okay ?

318
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:12,922
So here’s what l do. Okay.
l’m standing there...

319
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:16,443
... and l’m running and l see the beast
just coming towards me...

320
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:20,122
... so l just step to my left, l turn around,
and just as he’s coming to me...

321
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:22,204
... l take my sword, l draw it...

322
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:26,798
... and l lop off its head. And-- Yeah.
And l bend over, l pick it up...

323
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:29,521
... and l walk in triumph
back to the village.

324
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:30,762
- Amazing.
- You didn’t.

325
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:35,318
Oh, yes, my giant friend,
l did, and let me tell you this :

326
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:39,356
l had no trouble finding
female companionship that night.

327
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:40,721
If you know what l mean.

328
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:45,560
- Repeatedly.
- Yeah.

329
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:48,716
Yeah.

330
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:51,323
Yeah.

331
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:02,684
What the hell is going on ?

332
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:05,599
What do you mean ?

333
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:08,759
What do l mean ?
We leave for a few hours...

334
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,395
... and Lucius turns you all
into Stepford wives.

335
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,205
What did he do to you ?

336
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:15,244
Absolutely nothing.

337
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:17,079
Carson was right about him.

338
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:20,444
l agree. He has much to offer us.

339
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:21,875
Herbs and gourds ?

340
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:25,119
Please. The medicines alone
are worth whatever he asks.

341
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:27,278
The ointment is worth something ?

342
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:30,524
- l haven’t actually tested it.
- You’re taking his word for it ?

343
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:34,117
- You got a problem with that ?
- Me ? No. He might.

344
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:38,760
Teyla, this is the man who asked you
to be his seventh wife.

345
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:43,044
l know. l hope l didn’t upset him.

346
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:45,721
You just haven’t taken the time
to get to know Lucius.

347
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:47,645
Carson is right. Again.

348
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,722
Look, l think he could be
a great asset to us.

349
00:19:50,927 --> 00:19:53,316
He has traveled extensively
throughout this galaxy...

350
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:55,955
... and gathered a tremendous amount
of intelligence.

351
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:58,796
Has he shared any of this intelligence ?

352
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,402
Not yet...

353
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:03,683
... but he did give me this.

354
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:09,718
A very wise and kind man.

355
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:11,600
This is creeping me out.

356
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:15,600
Yeah. Reminds me of an old
<i>Batman</i> episode, actually.

357
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:18,235
Catwoman used a drug to put
a spell on Batman...

358
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:23,083
... make him fall in love with her. Ended
up doing all sorts of evil things for her.

359
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:26,485
Kind of a turn-on, actually.
Julie Newmar in the cat outfit--

360
00:20:26,647 --> 00:20:28,922
- Eartha Kitt was Catwoman.
- Not till season three.

361
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:30,884
- Really ?
- Yeah. You didn’t know that ?

362
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:38,436
Oh, so anyway, l did
a little investigating, and...

363
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:41,162
Surveillance footage from his quarters.

364
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:52,157
- What’s this ?
- l took the liberty of searching his room.

365
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:54,677
There’s some residue
from the liquid in the vial.

366
00:20:54,847 --> 00:20:56,803
It’Il take some time
to break it down.

367
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:59,037
l could have used Carson’s help
on this, but--

368
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:01,357
He’s off picking daffodils
for his new friend.

369
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,119
Right.

370
00:21:05,647 --> 00:21:07,205
That’s brilliant.

371
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,323
This is actually
how we found your planet.

372
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:12,526
So you fly to a planet,
you take the gate, you fly away.

373
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:15,804
We try to take stargates that are
in fixed orbit around a planet...

374
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,322
... and then, only if the planet
is uninhabited.

375
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:22,799
It wouldn’t be right to take a gate from
a world that depended on it for trade.

376
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:26,437
Wait a minute.
l’ve heard of this planet.

377
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:28,802
- You have ?
- Yeah, l have...

378
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:31,726
... and l heard that this planet
is completely uninhabited.

379
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:32,922
It’s what l heard.

380
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:36,443
l don’t know about you guys, but l got
a good feeling about this planet.

381
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:40,078
Well, then we could retrofit the gate
for space deployment.

382
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:44,201
Beautiful and brilliant.

383
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:47,396
The two B’s.

384
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:48,966
Dr. Weir.

385
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:52,802
Oh, hi, John. We were just discussing
the gate-harvesting program.

386
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:55,362
- Yeah, l heard.
- And Lucius knows...

387
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:58,200
... of an excellent planet
we should investigate.

388
00:21:58,407 --> 00:21:59,840
l heard that too.

389
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:03,204
We got intel that the Wraith
recently set up a major outpost there.

390
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:04,846
An alliance of three hives.

391
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:08,718
- No. Really ?
- Has your intel been verified ?

392
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:13,876
We haven’t put boots on the ground, no,
but our contacts are trustworthy.

393
00:22:14,087 --> 00:22:17,762
Not gonna send a team down there when
there’s still plenty of gates to scout.

394
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:22,162
John, you are
way behind Rodney’s quota.

395
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:24,517
Forget Rodney’s quota.

396
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,600
l am not sending a team
into harm’s way.

397
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:30,241
You know what ?
Colonel Sheppard is right.

398
00:22:30,447 --> 00:22:32,677
Don’t get me wrong.
With your advanced weapons...

399
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:36,442
... you could easily dispose of a tiny
Wraith outpost, if there even is one.

400
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:38,240
But ultimately...

401
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:42,281
... is it worth the risk ?
No matter how small that risk may be.

402
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:45,757
- Sure, people may label you a coward--
- Will you knock it off ?

403
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:47,600
Colonel.

404
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,685
l think it’s worth investigating.

405
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:52,042
No. l won’t allow it.

406
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:55,525
John, are you questioning
my authority ?

407
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:59,766
Yeah, when it comes to the security
of this base, you’re damn right l am.

408
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:04,037
From now on,
no one goes through that gate...

409
00:23:04,207 --> 00:23:07,040
... without my authorization.

410
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:14,205
What a terrible cold he must have.

411
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:17,677
This is not like him, Lucius.

412
00:23:17,847 --> 00:23:19,883
l apologize.

413
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:22,641
He makes me uncomfortable.

414
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:25,003
He’s really a good man.

415
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:27,078
l don’t see it.

416
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:32,516
If he doesn’t come around,
you’re gonna have to do something.

417
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:44,483
Élizabeth wants to send a team
to check out a gate...

418
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:47,002
- ... at a suspected Wraith outpost.
- Is she nuts ?

419
00:23:47,207 --> 00:23:49,357
Everybody’s nuts, Rodney.
Haven’t you noticed ?

420
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:52,035
- Right.
- We need to figure out why.

421
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:54,437
l’m working on it,
but there’s not enough liquid.

422
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,802
- l need more.
- l’Il go back to Lucius’village.

423
00:23:56,967 --> 00:24:00,004
- l’m sure he keeps a stash.
- You’re leaving me here alone ?

424
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:01,765
You said you need the liquid.

425
00:24:01,927 --> 00:24:04,760
- The place is turning into a nuthouse.
- Somebody’s gotta stay.

426
00:24:04,927 --> 00:24:06,042
Keep away from the nuts.

427
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:10,564
Disable the DHD as soon as l’m gone.
Prevent anybody from dialing out, okay ?

428
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:27,406
Willa.

429
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:31,045
Sheppard. Sheppard.

430
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:34,801
- Are you all right ?
- Where is he ?

431
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:37,117
- Lucius ?
- Did you take him ?

432
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:39,357
Of course, if you did, we’re not angry.

433
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:41,479
He came to my planet on his own.

434
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:45,526
Please send him back. It hurts us
to be away from him for so long.

435
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:48,926
Have you always felt
this way about him ?

436
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,078
No, but one day...

437
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:54,364
... as he returned from trading his wares
with a distant people...

438
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:58,196
... he told me a story,
a wonderful wise, sweet story...

439
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:00,927
... about something
he accidentally stepped in.

440
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:02,480
And from that day forward...

441
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:04,917
... we saw him for the wonderful man
he truly is.

442
00:25:05,327 --> 00:25:07,443
And before that ?

443
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:11,675
l am ashamed to admit that l refused
to share his bed more than once...

444
00:25:12,447 --> 00:25:15,200
... and since he is gone,
everyone is growing sick.

445
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:18,518
- It has only gotten worse.
- Take it easy.

446
00:25:18,687 --> 00:25:23,158
Have you ever seen him drink,
like, a liquid from a small vial ?

447
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,278
- His daily medicine.
- Does he need more ?

448
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:27,438
- l could bring it to him.
- We both can.

449
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:28,966
l can handle it.

450
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,164
Well, if we get you some,
will you bring him home ?

451
00:25:32,687 --> 00:25:34,040
Sure.

452
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:40,400
<i>Incoming wormhole.</i>
<i>Colonel Sheppard’s IDC.</i>

453
00:25:43,927 --> 00:25:46,805
l did. l jumped in. l jump
in the marsh and l’m looking...

454
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:51,006
... at four of them. l know,
l mean, four of them there...

455
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:54,603
- ... and l don’t know which one to save.
- What did you do ?

456
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,118
And the next day,
she became my wife.

457
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:01,757
My fifth wife, and now l have six.

458
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,758
You are a scoundrel.
That’s what you are.

459
00:26:04,207 --> 00:26:05,640
Come here. You gotta hear this.

460
00:26:05,807 --> 00:26:07,843
Lucius was telling
the most hysterical story.

461
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:10,043
You know they have marmots
on his planet ?

462
00:26:10,207 --> 00:26:12,801
They’re not marmots, exactly,
but it’s a rodent similar--

463
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:16,926
- You said you were gonna stay away.
- Yes, well, l tried to keep to myself...

464
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:20,045
... but Lucius here was concerned for me,
so he just came down--

465
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:23,563
Ronon held me against the wall.
- -and Lucius and l had a nice, long talk.

466
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:25,883
- Oh, you did ?
- And let me tell you...

467
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:27,685
... we have nothing to worry about.

468
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:30,919
This guy’s just a big knucklehead.
Aren’t you, you big knucklehead ?

469
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:33,282
Where’s Élizabeth ?

470
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,445
She’s out making me
something to eat.

471
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:38,122
- What ?
- l don’t know. She said it was a surprise.

472
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:40,881
So Rodney and l were waiting here
for the team to return.

473
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:43,561
- We thought that you were them.
- Teyla, Ronon, Beckett.

474
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,683
They volunteered
to check out M6H-491.

475
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:47,764
- l told you--
- Disable the DHD, l know.

476
00:26:47,927 --> 00:26:49,724
l’m sorry, l didn’t. But come on...

477
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:51,798
... Ronon and Teyla can handle
themselves.

478
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:54,765
- What about Beckett ?
- Now, he can walk on his hands.

479
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:57,521
He showed Lucius before he left.
You should have seen it.

480
00:26:57,687 --> 00:26:59,359
He was down on his hands...

481
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:00,801
McKay.

482
00:27:03,927 --> 00:27:06,646
We don’t know for sure
that there are Wraith on the planet.

483
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:08,565
We’Il find out soon enough,
won’t we ?

484
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,399
We sure will.

485
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,240
<i>Atlantis, this is Beckett.</i>
<i>We’re coming in hot.</i>

486
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:33,481
- You all right ?
- It was a little rough, but we’re good.

487
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:35,279
It was all terribly exciting.

488
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:39,156
Well, l guess we can assume
there are Wraith on that planet.

489
00:27:39,327 --> 00:27:41,079
Yes. Many.

490
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:43,039
Now, don’t overreact, John.

491
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:44,640
Are you kidding me ?

492
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:47,844
You send a team led by Beckett...

493
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:50,805
... to a planet full of Wraith.
How do you expect me to react ?

494
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,844
Well, firstly, they volunteered.

495
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:55,163
And secondly, we got the herb.

496
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:03,200
Carson, l will tell people of the tale
of your bravery for many years to come.

497
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,844
- You will ?
- Yes, l will.

498
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:09,798
You sent them to get an herb ?

499
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:11,042
We wanted to go.

500
00:28:11,247 --> 00:28:14,398
Okay. l’ve just about had enough.

501
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:17,756
Don’t touch it.

502
00:28:23,447 --> 00:28:25,802
What on earth is wrong with you,
John ?

503
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:28,762
We were just helping a friend.

504
00:28:29,647 --> 00:28:32,081
And there’s nothing wrong with that.

505
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:36,164
l think there’s something wrong
with him.

506
00:28:39,807 --> 00:28:41,445
You know what ?

507
00:28:42,007 --> 00:28:45,602
l’m just tired. It’s this damn cold.

508
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:48,362
l apologize.

509
00:28:50,007 --> 00:28:51,440
Maybe you should get some rest.

510
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:54,799
You’re probably right.
l just need a good night’s sleep.

511
00:29:11,927 --> 00:29:12,916
What does this do ?

512
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,038
That engages the HUD,
Heads Up Display.

513
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:17,562
Heads up. l love that.

514
00:29:17,727 --> 00:29:19,877
It gives me information
when flying the Jumper :

515
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:22,123
- Navigation, weapons.
- You fly this thing ?

516
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,680
- l can fly it too.
- Yes.

517
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,566
Now that you received
the ATA therapy, which l invented.

518
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:29,366
l was born with a gene
which makes me more proficient...

519
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:32,485
- ... at operating Ancient technology.
- He doesn’t fly any better.

520
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,763
- Don’t you lie--
- All right, all right. Boys...

521
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:37,839
... stop fighting. A gene, you say ?

522
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:40,959
It’s a genetic fingerprint, if you will,
which allows someone...

523
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:43,163
... to operate any technology
on Atlantis.

524
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:45,762
l developed an inoculation
which allows those...

525
00:29:45,927 --> 00:29:49,442
... who don’t naturally possess the gene,
such as Dr. McKay, to use it.

526
00:29:49,607 --> 00:29:53,964
Really ? A gene.
Just an inoculation, huh ? That’s great.

527
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:57,325
You know what’s really interesting.
If you look at this here...

528
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:03,640
Doc ?

529
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:05,725
Could l speak with you
for a sec ?

530
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,718
Excuse me.

531
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:18,121
l think there might be
something wrong with me.

532
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:21,480
It’s all right, son.

533
00:30:21,647 --> 00:30:24,525
Admitting it is the first step.

534
00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:32,157
So you finally came around, did you ?

535
00:30:32,327 --> 00:30:35,876
Once you get a chance to know Lucius,
he’s really a very wise and kind--

536
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:37,321
Oh, crap.

537
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:43,315
Why is the Jumper bay roof opening ?

538
00:30:43,487 --> 00:30:45,717
Jumper 3’s starting up. Who’s in it ?

539
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:49,721
- l don’t know.
- Jumper 3, please identify.

540
00:30:49,887 --> 00:30:54,119
Jumper 3, this is Flight.
Identify yourself. Look, close the door.

541
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:57,404
It’s too late. It’s left the bay.

542
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:08,246
Hey, Carson. Sorry about that.

543
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:09,965
What-- ? Why-- ?

544
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:13,682
l’m taking you to the mainland.
It’s for your own good. Trust me.

545
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:18,078
- How often does that happen ?
- Never.

546
00:31:18,247 --> 00:31:19,726
We have strict flight protocol--

547
00:31:19,887 --> 00:31:22,720
- He’d have to have a key--
- A security officer saw Sheppard...

548
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:26,084
... carrying Beckett to the Jumper bay
before the Jumper took off.

549
00:31:26,247 --> 00:31:29,284
- So it was them in the flying machine ?
- My computer’s missing.

550
00:31:29,447 --> 00:31:32,883
- A tablet, two drives, all my research.
- l told you that man was dangerous.

551
00:31:33,047 --> 00:31:35,242
l have to say, l am very
disappointed right now.

552
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:37,637
l am so very sorry, Lucius.

553
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:39,877
Mobilize Jumper teams.
l want them found.

554
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:41,446
Yes.

555
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:45,245
They’re very good. They will find them.

556
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:50,846
l need to get back.

557
00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:52,076
No, you don’t.

558
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:55,239
Lucius needs me. You have no right
to abduct me like this.

559
00:31:55,407 --> 00:31:57,602
Call it an intervention.

560
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:59,719
You probably don’t realize it now...

561
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:05,120
... but what you’re going through
is kind of like a detox.

562
00:32:05,327 --> 00:32:08,444
Now, according to research
Rodney was able to do...

563
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:10,962
... before joining the Lucius fan club...

564
00:32:11,127 --> 00:32:14,403
... that liquid he’s been drinking
contains some kind of a chemical.

565
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:18,880
It interacts with the body
and causes a secretion of a pheromone...

566
00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:21,641
... and then there’s something
about gamma activity...

567
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,399
... in the « prefrontral cortrex. »

568
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:27,526
Prefrontal cortex. The part of the brain
responsible for positive emotions.

569
00:32:27,807 --> 00:32:30,958
See ? That’s why l need you.
It seems that when people are exposed...

570
00:32:31,127 --> 00:32:34,483
... to this pheromone in close proximity,
it makes them...

571
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,642
... easy to influence.

572
00:32:37,807 --> 00:32:40,480
The longer they’re exposed,
the worse the addiction gets.

573
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:43,236
You mean literally
an addictive personality ?

574
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:44,846
That’s what it looks like.

575
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:47,156
It’s rubbish.

576
00:32:47,847 --> 00:32:49,246
Check for yourself.

577
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:52,319
l will bet you a year’s pay
that the liquid in that vial...

578
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:56,082
... is some kind of an extract made
from the herb you collected for him.

579
00:32:56,247 --> 00:32:58,761
He made you his mule.

580
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:01,163
If this is true,
why weren’t you affected ?

581
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:03,005
My cold. l can hardly breathe.

582
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,398
Plus, l haven’t been around him much.
Look.

583
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:10,439
l would just kidnap him
and take him away somewhere...

584
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:12,279
... till the pheromone wore off...

585
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:15,359
... but the people back on his planet
are starting to get sick.

586
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:18,121
It looks like they’re gonna get worse.
l don’t want to...

587
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:21,916
- ... put our people through that.
- You’re doing it to me right now.

588
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,685
Buck up, Carson.

589
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:27,884
You haven’t been exposed that long.
Look, l need you...

590
00:33:28,087 --> 00:33:30,760
... to figure out a way
how to counteract this thing.

591
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:33,316
There’s gotta be an antidote
of some kind.

592
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,516
l can’t.

593
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:40,406
Yes, you can.

594
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:42,319
You can beat it.

595
00:33:44,247 --> 00:33:45,680
But he needs me.

596
00:33:51,847 --> 00:33:54,315
We should head back.
We’ve been searching for hours.

597
00:33:54,527 --> 00:33:55,960
We just left, McKay.

598
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:59,164
l don’t like being this far away
from Atlantis. Lucius is worried.

599
00:33:59,327 --> 00:34:01,557
- You think he’s worried ?
- <i>Jumper 2, report.</i>

600
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:03,763
We’re reading several life signs.

601
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:06,606
They might be Athosian hunting parties.
We’Il check them.

602
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:11,716
- Lucius worried about us ?
- <i>Lucius ? He’s fine. Just keep looking.</i>

603
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:13,764
l should have stayed with him.

604
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:22,159
Wait just a minute.

605
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:23,442
What is it ?

606
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:25,643
Don’t move.

607
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:33,362
- That thing’s set to stun, right ?
- Yeah.

608
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,405
Good.

609
00:34:36,927 --> 00:34:38,280
Carson, are you all right ?

610
00:34:38,447 --> 00:34:41,917
l will be, once l get back to Lucius.

611
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:45,200
What did you shoot him for ?

612
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:51,476
Now we’re gonna have to carry him
all the way back to the Jumper.

613
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:03,595
Good morning, colonel.

614
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:06,042
l want to apologize
for this harsh treatment.

615
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:08,118
l hate that Élizabeth had to do this.

616
00:35:08,327 --> 00:35:09,555
Cut the crap.

617
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:12,166
So...

618
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:13,920
... that herb of yours...

619
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:16,362
One of my greatest discoveries.

620
00:35:16,527 --> 00:35:21,282
Well, it’s my only great discovery,
but you got to admit, it’s pretty great.

621
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:23,525
How’d you get by before that ?

622
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:26,959
l was a baker. Bread, mostly.

623
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,197
The occasional muffin at festival time.

624
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:32,078
So that herb
pretty much changed everything.

625
00:35:33,687 --> 00:35:35,279
Yeah.

626
00:35:35,727 --> 00:35:39,436
Yeah, l baked it into my own bread--
l like to experiment.

627
00:35:39,607 --> 00:35:42,804
- -and l noticed that people started
to like me. Well, hate me less...

628
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:44,798
... but pretty soon it became like.

629
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:47,040
So l perfected a potion.

630
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:49,283
It worked great for years.

631
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,961
Then the Wraith set up
an outpost on the only planet...

632
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:53,958
... where l could get the herb.

633
00:35:54,127 --> 00:35:55,799
l knew l could never go back there.

634
00:35:56,407 --> 00:35:57,476
Then we showed up.

635
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:01,078
l’m telling you, it was fate.

636
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:03,966
And everybody wanted to help,
so l let them.

637
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:06,766
See, that’s the great thing
about this herb.

638
00:36:06,927 --> 00:36:08,838
Nobody gets hurt.

639
00:36:09,007 --> 00:36:12,522
They just wanna help me all the time.
What’s wrong with that ?

640
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:15,925
l’m a nice guy.
l never make them do anything...

641
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:18,885
- ... they didn’t wanna do.
- Six wives.

642
00:36:19,087 --> 00:36:20,486
Sometimes all at once.

643
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:24,885
When you get over this cold,
we’re gonna have a long chat.

644
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:27,083
Face to face.

645
00:36:27,247 --> 00:36:30,239
And l got a feeling we’re
gonna become the best of friends.

646
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:33,680
And you’re gonna wanna
help me too, all the time.

647
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:34,996
And you’Il love it.

648
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,845
Just a warning, Lucius.

649
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:41,079
You get too close to me,
it’Il be the last thing you do.

650
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:42,521
That’s all right, colonel.

651
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:44,446
l’m in no rush.

652
00:36:44,607 --> 00:36:46,199
<i>Lucius ?</i>

653
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:48,361
Yeah, go ahead, Carson.

654
00:36:48,527 --> 00:36:52,406
<i>-I’ve finished preparing the inoculation.</i>
- All right, l’Il be right down.

655
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:55,400
l gotta go get an inoculation.
We’Il talk after.

656
00:36:56,047 --> 00:37:01,997
- Giving you the ATA therapy ?
- Yeah. Isn’t that great ?

657
00:37:08,607 --> 00:37:10,677
There. All done.

658
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:14,317
Now, remember, it’s only effective
in 47 percent of those who receive it.

659
00:37:14,487 --> 00:37:16,557
Well, l’m a naturally lucky fella.

660
00:37:16,727 --> 00:37:20,037
The only way to know for sure is to
have you try to operate something.

661
00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:21,401
Okay.

662
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:23,364
It takes about an hour to be effective.

663
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:27,321
In the meantime, just rest easy,
dear friend.

664
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:29,599
Are you okay ?
Can l get you anything ?

665
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:32,760
No, Rodney. l’m fine.

666
00:37:32,927 --> 00:37:34,042
- You sure ?
- Absolutely.

667
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:37,563
- Because it would no trouble.
- Mess hall. Blue Jell-O.

668
00:37:37,727 --> 00:37:40,639
- Just a little bit of whipped cream.
- Right away.

669
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:47,356
We really should talk about marriage.

670
00:37:50,287 --> 00:37:52,039
Jumper 1, this is Flight.

671
00:37:52,247 --> 00:37:54,636
The bay doors are open.

672
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:56,400
You are go for launch.

673
00:37:57,167 --> 00:38:00,204
« Go for launch. »
That’s so exciting. Thanks, Rodney.

674
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:02,318
All right, here goes.

675
00:38:02,487 --> 00:38:04,284
- l’Il take it from here.
- What-- ?

676
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:08,601
Wait. You’re supposed to be in jail.

677
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:09,961
- Carson.
- Save your breath.

678
00:38:10,127 --> 00:38:12,038
Your charm no longer has
any effect on me.

679
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,005
No. No, but, Carson...

680
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:21,642
- We’re supposed to be best of friends.
- Carson didn’t give you the ATA gene.

681
00:38:21,847 --> 00:38:22,836
What ?

682
00:38:23,007 --> 00:38:26,716
It’s a serum that effectively neutralizes
the chemical in that herb of yours.

683
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,479
Took some myself.

684
00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:32,606
l don’t know what that means.

685
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:36,203
It means we can have that face-to-face
conversation you wanted us to have.

686
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:40,003
The only thing that’Il happen
is you’Il catch my cold.

687
00:38:42,647 --> 00:38:46,037
What is taking him so long ?
Okay, l should go up there.

688
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:47,686
Wait. Wait.

689
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:49,196
They’re taking off.

690
00:38:54,087 --> 00:38:55,998
It worked.

691
00:38:59,327 --> 00:39:00,601
He’s flying it.

692
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:08,485
Fly, Lucius, fly.

693
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:18,604
- Where are you taking me ?
- Little vacation.

694
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:23,841
Time to let Dr. Beckett give the serum
to my people without you interfering.

695
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:25,719
And then what ?

696
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:28,044
Then maybe l’Il take you back home.

697
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:30,846
l’m sure your people will be thrilled
to see you again.

698
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:33,483
You would do that for me ?

699
00:39:33,687 --> 00:39:36,679
Without even being
under the effect of the herb ?

700
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:41,362
- After all l did ?
- Well, l’m a nice guy.

701
00:39:41,607 --> 00:39:44,724
Oh, colonel, l can’t thank you enough.
Thank you so much--

702
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:47,401
After l give them the serum.

703
00:40:04,447 --> 00:40:06,915
So how was Lucius’homecoming ?

704
00:40:07,087 --> 00:40:08,440
Well, they didn’t kill him...

705
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:11,167
... although l do see a string
of divorces in his future.

706
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,045
If they haven’t strung him up first.

707
00:40:13,207 --> 00:40:16,324
The townspeople are over
their withdrawal. l doubt that’Il happen.

708
00:40:16,487 --> 00:40:20,844
That is, unless we discover he’s revealed
the location of Atlantis to anyone.

709
00:40:21,007 --> 00:40:22,918
In which case l said
l’d track him down...

710
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,318
- ... hang him by his feet and cut off his--
- Thank you. We get the idea.

711
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:30,719
So everyone here back to normal ?

712
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:33,966
We’re still fine, John.

713
00:40:34,647 --> 00:40:36,922
No lingering desires ?

714
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:39,837
Secret longings for his touch ?

715
00:40:40,127 --> 00:40:43,961
It’s embarrassing enough without you
constantly reminding us, thank you.

716
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:46,398
All right, all right.

717
00:40:46,607 --> 00:40:50,361
Anyway, l better get back and clean
your quarters before the next scout.

718
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:52,645
Right.

719
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:54,639
Rodney.

720
00:40:55,647 --> 00:40:58,480
It was one teeny, tiny taste
for research purposes.

721
00:40:58,687 --> 00:40:59,676
- Burn it.
- All of it.

722
00:40:59,847 --> 00:41:01,360
Right now.

723
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:04,803
Fine. Story of my life.
