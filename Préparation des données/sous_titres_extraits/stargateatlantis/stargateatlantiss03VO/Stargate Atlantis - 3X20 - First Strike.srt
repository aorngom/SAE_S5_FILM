00:00:01,647 --> 00:00:03,365
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis :

1
00:00:03,527 --> 00:00:05,757
They’re not people. They’re machines.

2
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:08,640
They even built themselves
a version of Atlantis.

3
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:12,157
<i>Probes of your minds</i>
<i>uncovered the truth.</i>

4
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:14,597
You came to live there from your
original home...

5
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:17,645
... a planet called Earth.
Our intention is to destroy it.

6
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:21,681
They see humans as the favored siblings
who receive all the parents’love.

7
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:23,559
<i>They’ve been seeking revenge since.</i>

8
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:26,839
<i>Atlantis is under attack</i>
<i>from Replicators.</i>

9
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,646
<i>I’Il be damned if I’m gonna</i>
<i>let a bunch of Replicators...</i>

10
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:31,240
... take our home away from us.

11
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:35,156
<i>They emit a directional energy beam that</i>
<i>disrupts the connection between nanites.</i>

12
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,602
<i>The Replictators fall apart</i>
<i>when you fire on them.</i>

13
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:40,998
Well, we beat them this time.
Maybe we scared them off.

14
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:43,245
Maybe.

15
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,319
Dr. Weir ?

16
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:51,081
Dr. Keller,
how is my head of medicine ?

17
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:52,839
Acting head of medicine actually...

18
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:55,316
... and that’s what l wanted
to talk to you about.

19
00:00:55,487 --> 00:00:57,079
What’s up ?

20
00:00:58,167 --> 00:00:59,600
l need to be replaced.

21
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:01,485
Excuse me ?

22
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,757
Look, after Carson...

23
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,325
Someone had to step up
and take over.

24
00:01:06,487 --> 00:01:08,796
And l’m glad to help,
don’t get me wrong...

25
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:11,959
... but l’m not qualified to run
a department of this size.

26
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:15,164
You need someone better.

27
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:17,318
Everyone down there says
you’re doing great.

28
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:19,239
Well, A, l’m not sure that’s true...

29
00:01:19,407 --> 00:01:22,444
... and B, it’s been pretty smooth sailing
over the last few weeks.

30
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:23,722
l think l’ve been lucky.

31
00:01:23,887 --> 00:01:25,798
The l. O.A. are reviewing candidates...

32
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:28,527
... but they’re not that great
at making quick decisions.

33
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:31,326
Yeah. So a week ? Two weeks ?

34
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:33,284
l just haven’t been sleeping very well.

35
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:36,280
This whole being in control thing
kind of makes me anxious.

36
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:38,517
Carson felt the same way
his first few months.

37
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:40,723
l appreciate you trying to lie to me.

38
00:01:44,247 --> 00:01:47,398
Look, l feel very comfortable
with my life in your hands...

39
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:50,923
... and at the end of the day, that means
you’re doing a pretty good job.

40
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:54,523
Dealing with the pressure,
it does get easier with time.

41
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:59,404
Right. How much time exactly ?

42
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:03,084
Like it’Il get easier the next two weeks
and then you’Il replace me...

43
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:05,317
... so l can go back to being
a regular doctor ?

44
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:07,398
l’Il keep you posted.

45
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:11,001
Thanks.

46
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:15,318
Can l please have
someone else do these ?

47
00:02:15,487 --> 00:02:17,045
- Performance evaluations ?
- Yes.

48
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:19,721
No. Year-end employee
reviews are important.

49
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:22,162
They’re how people
get promotions and raises.

50
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:25,046
Look, asking me to do performance
evaluations is ridiculous.

51
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:28,119
l am the first to admit l don’t
know these people, nor do l care.

52
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:32,445
If you’d like, l can take you to the labs
and point at the people who annoy me...

53
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:34,598
... but that’s about as useful as l get.

54
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,005
- All done.
- Of course.

55
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:39,845
That was quick.

56
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:43,322
John, wait a minute.
You’ve just given everyone...

57
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:45,245
... excellent and above-averages.

58
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:46,436
- Can l do that ?
- No.

59
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:49,167
l know this isn’t the most
glamorous part of your job...

60
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:51,158
... but you are in leadership positions.

61
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:54,683
And, unfortunately, that comes
with administrative responsibilities.

62
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:57,321
Everybody works for me
is excellent and above average.

63
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:01,162
Do you want me to lie ? Because
l don’t think leaders should lie.

64
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:03,803
- Dr. Weir ?
- Yes, Chuck.

65
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:05,759
The <i>Apollo</i> just came out
of hyperspace.

66
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:08,083
They’re ahead of schedule.

67
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:11,683
Probably just trying to show off,
you know, being a new ship and all.

68
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:14,839
Col. Ellis, you’ve made excellent time
on your first voyage here.

69
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:16,486
<i>Thank you. I’m beaming down now.</i>

70
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:17,716
Very well, we’Il--

71
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:24,198
Set up in the conference room.

72
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:26,483
- Doctor.
- Colonel.

73
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:28,365
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

74
00:03:28,527 --> 00:03:31,121
Colonel Sheppard. Dr. McKay.

75
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:34,524
This is gonna make things easier.
l’Il need to brief you immediately.

76
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,166
What’s going on ?

77
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:38,636
Well, l’d prefer to talk in private.

78
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:49,962
Ever since the human-form Replicators
made a play for the city...

79
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:53,039
... we’ve had the <i>Daedalus</i> make
regular reconnaissance fly-bys...

80
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:55,767
- ... of their home planet.
- Yes, we know.

81
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:58,680
Two months ago
it took these pictures.

82
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,796
l’m sorry. What am l supposed
to be looking at here ?

83
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:05,083
- Nothing.
- Excuse me ?

84
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:10,116
This image was taken
about three weeks ago...

85
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:12,960
... in the very same location.

86
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,601
They’re building ships. A lot of them.

87
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:19,197
- Why weren’t we made aware of this ?
- l’m making you aware of it now.

88
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:22,967
If they’re coming for us,
we should bolster the shield.

89
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:25,163
- We should--
- They’re not gonna get here.

90
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:27,716
l’m here to inform you
that in precisely 12 hours...

91
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:29,843
... the <i>Apollo</i>, in consort
with your team...

92
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:33,484
... will launch a surgical strike
on the Replicator planet.

93
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:42,316
- So you’re gonna blow up their ships ?
- That’s right.

94
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,119
- Just like that ?
- Just like that.

95
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:45,800
How do you plan on doing that ?

96
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:47,599
A set of Mark-IX tactical nukes...

97
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:52,001
... housed in a weapons platform
code-named » Horizon. »

98
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,441
How many nukes do you have ?

99
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:56,081
The Horizon carries six warheads
and four decoys.

100
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:59,796
l’m gonna need you to do
a final inspection before we head out.

101
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:01,520
- Wait. Six ?
- That’s right.

102
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,876
That’s not enough.

103
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:05,920
The Replicators
are self-replicating robots...

104
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:09,284
- ... which means that they can...
- l’m aware of that, thank you.

105
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,358
They’re not like the Milky Way
Replicators.

106
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:13,438
Their ships aren’t built
from nano cells.

107
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,485
They’re constructed of real material
that can be destroyed.

108
00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:19,485
- Six will be more than enough for now.
-« ou » ?For now« ou » ??

109
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:21,803
Isn’t this a bit like
poking a sleeping dragon ?

110
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:24,925
Why don’t we just wait until
Area 51 finishes the P.W.A.R. Ws ?

111
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:26,162
Which one’s that again ?

112
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:28,124
Planetary-wide
anti-Replicator weapons.

113
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,562
The Asgard were capable
of creating a satellite...

114
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:33,036
... that could wipe out
an entire Replicator planet.

115
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:35,243
We’ve had some trouble
making our own, but--

116
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:39,326
Would l have preferred taking out
an entire planet at once ? Absolutely.

117
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:43,163
But this image is giving the l. O.A.
a lot of sleepless nights.

118
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:45,597
The Replicators know
the location of Earth...

119
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:48,406
... and with these new ships,
have the means to get there.

120
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:51,286
We can’t just sit on our hands
while the guys at Area 51...

121
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:53,085
... try to come up with a solution.

122
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:58,645
This mission’s primary objective
is to eliminate key military targets.

123
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:01,560
We’Il come back and finish
once the new weapon is running.

124
00:07:01,727 --> 00:07:04,844
Doctor, l’Il need you to start your
inspections as soon as possible.

125
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,646
- Yeah, sure. l just--
- Dr. McKay is ready to beam.

126
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:09,678
Well, not right--

127
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:13,920
Okay.

128
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,638
We’re finished here.

129
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:19,606
Thank you.

130
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:26,759
- Can you believe this ?
- No.

131
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,284
Almost seems too good to be true.

132
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:31,276
What ?

133
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:34,877
Well, if those nukes do what Ellis
says they do...

134
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,362
Since we won back the city,
we haven’t heard...

135
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:39,483
... so much as a peep
from the Replicators.

136
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:41,439
Well, obviously
they haven’t gone away.

137
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:44,917
No, but maybe they’ve decided that
we are more trouble than we’re worth.

138
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:48,636
The threat of our A.R. weapons
is enough to keep them at bay.

139
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:52,437
You don’t build that many ships
to make a run at Atlantis.

140
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:55,997
They’re headed for Earth.

141
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:03,280
Colonel.

142
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:05,165
May l have a word ?

143
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:06,726
Sure.

144
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:14,725
This mission is a mistake.

145
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:16,764
It most certainly is not.

146
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:18,519
It is an ineffectual first strike.

147
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,962
You gotta know how dangerous
that could be for us.

148
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:23,436
All due respect, doctor,
it won’t be ineffectual.

149
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:25,757
Besides, the l. O.A.
doesn’t think we can wait.

150
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:29,164
l think we should stall them.
Try to open a round of negotiations.

151
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:30,686
They’re not a race of people.

152
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:32,803
They’re a weapon.
Try to keep that in mind.

153
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:35,765
Weapon or not, they’re sentient.
Negotiating with them...

154
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:39,124
... could buy us enough time to get
the P.W.A.R.W. up and running.

155
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:42,161
Usually, l’d be more than happy
to go 12 rounds here...

156
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:45,125
... about who’s right and who’s wrong,
but it wouldn’t matter.

157
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:48,518
l have my orders. You don’t have
the authority to tell me to stand down.

158
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:51,082
So again, with all due respect...

159
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:54,438
... ma’am, l have a mission to execute.

160
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:05,281
Well, the specs check out...

161
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:07,722
... and we’ve loaded
the target information.

162
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:11,721
- They’re ready.
- Yup. It’s good to go.

163
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:13,765
This is a bad idea, isn’t it ?

164
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:15,758
We could tell them
they’re not ready.

165
00:09:15,927 --> 00:09:18,441
There’s a fault in the guidance system
or something.

166
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:19,676
l thought about that.

167
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:23,078
They’re gonna have guys here
to contradict us pretty quickly.

168
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:27,441
We’re here alone.
We could make them not ready.

169
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:29,877
They’re building an armada, Radek.

170
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:32,720
l saw them.
They showed me the pictures.

171
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:34,878
l’d feel stupid if we’d
break this thing...

172
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:37,845
... only to have the Replicators show up
and destroy the city.

173
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:40,878
Yeah, that would be bad.

174
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,837
l’Il tell the colonel we’re good to go.

175
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:51,562
- Hey.
- Hey.

176
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:57,197
Colonel Ellis has asked me
to join the mission.

177
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:59,040
l know.

178
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,516
l’m just gonna stay behind in a cloaked
Jumper after they launch the warheads...

179
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,679
- ... do some battle damage assessment.
- l know that too.

180
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:10,121
He told me that you called
Woolsey and General O’Neill...

181
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:13,120
- ... to try to get this called off.
- Yes, l did.

182
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:14,720
They didn’t bite ?

183
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:16,684
They did not.

184
00:10:17,127 --> 00:10:20,722
Look, l know you think
we’re doing the wrong thing here but...

185
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,525
John.

186
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:25,839
Good luck.

187
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:40,160
All right. The Horizon is online...

188
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:45,037
... the warheads are armed
and we are ready for final sequencing...

189
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:47,516
... as soon as we drop out
of hyperspace.

190
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:49,882
Start now. Open the bomb bay doors.

191
00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:51,241
<i>We’re still in hyperspace.</i>

192
00:10:51,407 --> 00:10:54,285
We’re coming out of our jump
uncomfortably close to the planet.

193
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:57,120
l don’t wanna waste any time.
Just get it done.

194
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:59,323
Well, you’re the boss.

195
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:13,316
Ready to launch on your command.

196
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:15,722
You’re sure about this, right ?

197
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:17,679
Like this is the right thing to do ?

198
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,321
Not the best time
for that kind of talk, doctor.

199
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:22,560
Right. Sorry.

200
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:25,605
<i>Coming out of hyperspace</i>
<i>in five, four...</i>

201
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:27,798
... three, two, one.

202
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:32,760
Launch the Horizon.

203
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:55,997
We have detonation confirmation
on all six warheads.

204
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,078
Sheppard, you have a go for launch.

205
00:12:58,287 --> 00:12:59,606
Copy that.

206
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,676
<i>I’m clear. Jump away.</i>

207
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:07,519
Very well. Pick you up in an hour.

208
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,200
Get us out of here.

209
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:23,198
There is so much
radiation interference...

210
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:25,642
... it’s hard to get
an accurate yield calculation.

211
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:29,038
There’s more than enough data.
It’s not like we’re taking out a person.

212
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:31,243
We’re taking out massive chunks
of a city.

213
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:34,683
Someone just please tell me
if we hit our targets or not.

214
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,917
If this data is right...

215
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:40,796
... then all of your primaries and most of
your secondaries have been incinerated.

216
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,639
Excellent.

217
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:51,118
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

218
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:53,881
- l hear congratulations are in order.
- You heard right.

219
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,517
How was the mission ?
Was it a success ?

220
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:58,046
We did get all the ships.

221
00:13:58,247 --> 00:14:00,078
l wish l could have
been there to see it.

222
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:03,478
Space battles are a lot more exciting
on TV than they are in real life.

223
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:05,484
Dr. Weir.

224
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:07,718
You’re going to wanna see this.

225
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:10,321
We’ve got a contact,
just came out of hyperspace.

226
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:12,398
- Is it broadcasting IFF ?
- No, ma’am.

227
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:15,440
- Wraith ?
- It’s very small. l doubt it.

228
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:17,480
Raise the shield.

229
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:19,564
It’s taking up
a geo-synchronous orbit.

230
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:21,359
What is it ?

231
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,482
Maybe we should have the <i>Apollo</i>
check it out.

232
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:26,922
Tell the colonel
he needs to get back to his ship.

233
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:47,245
- Right ahead of us, sir.
- Shields ?

234
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:49,602
Affirmative. Shields are up.

235
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:54,245
<i>Okay, I’ve got a visual.</i>

236
00:14:54,447 --> 00:14:56,722
It looks like a satellite of some sort.

237
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:09,166
- It’s a stargate.
- A stargate ?

238
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:11,045
<i>That’s right.</i>

239
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:13,881
- l thought you said it was a satellite ?
- <i>It’s both.</i>

240
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:17,363
It’s a satellite, but in the middle
there’s a stargate.

241
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:20,559
- What could be the purpose of that ?
- No idea.

242
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:26,037
- It just activated.
- <i>The gate ?</i>

243
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:33,003
Get us away from it.

244
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:35,637
Sir, the satellite is turning again.

245
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,683
It’s hitting the planet.

246
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:56,400
It’s a sustained beam.

247
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:58,478
That is bad
for a dozen different reasons.

248
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:07,766
It’s protected by a shield.

249
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,446
<i>Give me some options, mcKay.</i>

250
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:11,677
The shield’s taking its power
from the beam.

251
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,122
There was a slight drop in output
when you fired.

252
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:17,120
- <i>Could I get a nuke past its shield ?</i>
- No. Probably not.

253
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:19,716
l’Il get in the chair,
give it everything we’ve got.

254
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:23,721
l said slight, as in. 002. l doubt any
amount of firepower will collapse it...

255
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:26,196
- ... while that beam is active.
- Then what do we do ?

256
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,039
<i>We stand down and let me think.</i>

257
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:30,044
Give me five minutes. l’Il brief you.

258
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,563
- McKay, it’s shooting at us.
- And the shields are holding.

259
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,719
We’ve got plenty of time.
Just give me five minutes.

260
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:51,647
- What have you got ?
- We’re in trouble.

261
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:54,879
Took you five minutes to figure
that out ? You’re slipping, buddy.

262
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,356
The satellite is basically
a stripped-down ship.

263
00:16:57,567 --> 00:17:00,127
There’s an engine, a shield
and navigational systems.

264
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:03,239
There’s a small power source
to take it to its target...

265
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:05,403
... and power it until the gate’s dialed.

266
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,804
Once a wormhole has been established,
whoever’s on the dialing side...

267
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:11,356
... fires a beam into it
and it comes out on our side.

268
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:14,087
Allowing them to fire on us
and power the satellite.

269
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:15,362
That’s very clever.

270
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:17,961
As long as they keep
the beam powered from home...

271
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:19,719
... the weapon remains operational.

272
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:21,957
Oh, and one fun,
added side-bonus, is that...

273
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:26,046
... because their stargate is so close to
our planet, we can’t dial our stargate.

274
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:27,242
We’re stuck.

275
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,005
Maybe that’s a good thing.

276
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:32,603
The beam will turn off at the end
of the gate’s 38-minute cycle.

277
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:35,964
We dial our gate at that precise
moment, we can neutralize theirs.

278
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:39,035
And if it’s not pulling power
from the beam anymore...

279
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:41,482
... then we can collapse its shield
and destroy it.

280
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:44,559
Problem is l don’t think
it’s gonna shut down in 38 minutes.

281
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:47,844
l thought it was physically impossible
for an artificial wormhole...

282
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:51,044
- ... to stay open any longer.
- There is one exception to that rule.

283
00:17:51,247 --> 00:17:54,319
The SGC has encountered attacks
of this kind on their own stargate.

284
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:57,206
We’ve discovered that
if you pump enough energy into it...

285
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,278
... a stargate can be active indefinitely.

286
00:17:59,487 --> 00:18:02,524
That would require an insane
amount of power, wouldn’t it ?

287
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:05,116
Like a black hole
or an unlimited number of ZPMs.

288
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:07,522
So we can assume
the Replicators are behind this ?

289
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:09,524
- Well, l hope so.
- You hope so ?

290
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:12,042
Otherwise we’ve discovered
another powerful enemy.

291
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:15,040
If it is a normal stargate,
can we contact the dialing planet ?

292
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:19,320
l’Il need to boost the signal considerably
to get through the interference, but yes.

293
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:21,199
See what you can do, please.

294
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,839
Why would you wanna contact them ?

295
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:25,116
To negotiate.

296
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:28,683
It’s a waste of energy.
We need to figure out how to destroy it.

297
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:32,197
l’d love to go 12 rounds here
about who’s right and who’s wrong...

298
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:35,399
... but at the end of the day,
l’m responsible for the city...

299
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:38,400
... and you don’t have the authority
to tell me to stand down.

300
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:42,197
So with all due respect,
l think l’Il place my call.

301
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:52,802
All right. l think l’ve got it.

302
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:55,242
They’re responding
to the transmission.

303
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:59,121
- Oberoth.
- <i>Dr. Weir.</i>

304
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,596
l must say, l’m surprised to see you.

305
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,277
<i>Each of us exists within the collective</i>
<i>and can be replicated many times.</i>

306
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:08,037
You need to disable
your weapon immediately.

307
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,761
- <i>That is not possible.</i>
- We had no choice but to attack.

308
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:13,487
You were building warships,
they needed to be neutralized.

309
00:19:13,647 --> 00:19:15,444
<i>And now so do you.</i>

310
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:17,842
That assault was just
the tip of the spear.

311
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:20,282
We were hoping it would bring you
to your senses.

312
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:24,486
If you don’t stop this aggression, we
will be forced to launch an all-out attack.

313
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:27,201
<i>Really ? Why have you waited ?</i>

314
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:30,922
The annihilation of your people
is not our goal.

315
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,203
We would like for peace
to exist between us.

316
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:35,398
But we will not stand by
while you build...

317
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:37,478
... weapons that can be
used to destroy us.

318
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:40,639
<i>Interesting.</i>
<i>We feel the same way about you.</i>

319
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,246
Perhaps l should remind you...

320
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:45,319
... every time we’ve met in battle
our side has been victorious.

321
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:47,762
Élizabeth, they’re attempting
to upload a virus.

322
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:50,845
- l’ve been able to stop it for now--
- Shut it down.

323
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,485
- Well, that went well.
- Yeah...

324
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:57,524
... he’s always been
one of my favorites.

325
00:19:58,527 --> 00:20:02,236
What if the gate doesn’t shut down
at the end of its 38-minute cycle ?

326
00:20:02,847 --> 00:20:06,601
If they’re able to maintain the beam’s
intensity, which l’m sure they will--

327
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:08,923
And how long until our shield fails ?

328
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,123
Twenty-nine hours.

329
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:30,805
Well, it was worth a shot.

330
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:33,197
All right. We’re gonna
need another plan.

331
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,517
Yeah. Okay.

332
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:40,077
Stop dialing. It’s not working.

333
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:41,515
Sir.

334
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:45,125
You two give us a minute.

335
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:48,757
What can l do for you, John ?

336
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:52,397
We need to head back
to the Replicator planet.

337
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,596
We do, do we ?

338
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:56,327
If this satellite weapon
is powered by its home world...

339
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:58,478
... maybe we can neutralize it
at the source.

340
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:02,000
The <i>Apollo</i> is in no condition
to get into battle right now.

341
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:04,158
That beam took a lot out
of our shield.

342
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:06,676
- We gotta do something.
- We did do something.

343
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:10,362
l’m sorry, but l can’t help to think that
we’re somehow responsible for this.

344
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,960
Why, because Weir said so ?

345
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,282
No, sir.

346
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:16,684
John, listen to me. l--

347
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:19,926
l’ve been over your record.
l know you have your detractors.

348
00:21:20,087 --> 00:21:22,726
But personally,
l think you’ve done a hell of a job here.

349
00:21:23,327 --> 00:21:24,555
Thank you, sir.

350
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,758
You should be running Atlantis,
not Dr. Weir.

351
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:32,765
Well, then l’d be the man
and who would l have to rage against ?

352
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,560
Listen.

353
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:40,164
Because of us, Earth won’t have to deal
with an armada of Replicator ships...

354
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:44,445
... so whatever happens here,
we did the right thing today.

355
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:52,005
l’m sorry.
It’s just they didn’t even consult me.

356
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:54,556
l imagine they felt the need
for secrecy was great.

357
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:58,726
l have the highest level of clearance
humanly possible, Teyla. No.

358
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:00,366
They’re trying to undermine me.

359
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:04,440
Some of the military doesn’t like that a
civilian, let alone a woman, is in charge.

360
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:06,842
Surely General O’Neill
doesn’t feel that way.

361
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:09,726
And the l. O.A., they’ve backed you.
They believe in you.

362
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:13,482
Yes, when things are going well, but as
soon as we run into a major problem...

363
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:16,366
... the military steps in
and assumes absolute control.

364
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:19,559
Certainly you don’t wish
to coordinate military attacks ?

365
00:22:19,727 --> 00:22:21,683
No, that’s not what l’m saying.

366
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:24,645
Our current situation
could have easily been avoided.

367
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:27,879
l told them as much. But they put
no weight behind my opinions...

368
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,356
... regarding the safety
and protection of the city.

369
00:22:30,527 --> 00:22:34,076
Yes, the l. O.A. is happy to have me
as lead administrator...

370
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:37,080
... but when it comes
to the big decisions...

371
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:43,806
If we get out of this,
l think l may have to step down.

372
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:46,760
Give it some time.
You need to step back and--

373
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:49,077
<i>I’ve got something.</i>

374
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:59,678
We were throwing some ideas
back and forth.

375
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:01,519
Well, he was throwing them forth.

376
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:04,878
While he was droning on about some
idea, it suddenly occurred to me.

377
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:07,607
This city has encountered
problems like this before so--

378
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:11,316
l don’t need the history of your idea,
doctor. l’Il let that be a surprise...

379
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:14,081
... when l read your autobiography.
Just tell me the plan.

380
00:23:15,647 --> 00:23:17,797
- We submerge it.
- l’m sorry ?

381
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:19,076
We submerge the city.

382
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,996
l thought you said
we couldn’t submerge the city.

383
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:24,482
That was two years ago
before the Ancients came...

384
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:26,239
... and activated new systems. See--

385
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:28,682
The how is complicated,
but l think it’s possible.

386
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:31,645
- It’s not a permanent solution--
- It’Il buy us enough time...

387
00:23:31,807 --> 00:23:33,877
- ... until we come up with one.
- Exactly.

388
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:36,043
- How much time ?
- Some. As much as a week.

389
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,765
l don’t understand. Why ?

390
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:40,122
The history part
would have made that clearer.

391
00:23:40,287 --> 00:23:42,198
Had you been more patient,
l would have--

392
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:44,238
McKay.

393
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:48,483
Ten thousand years ago,
when the Ancients were under siege...

394
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:52,083
... they sank the city to dissipate
the Wraith’s energy blasts in the water.

395
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:55,802
This way, the shield was able to hold
longer than it could on the surface.

396
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:57,725
So now we submerge the city.

397
00:23:57,887 --> 00:24:01,516
The water attenuates the satellite’s beam
intensity, buys us more shield time.

398
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:04,247
We cannot predict how much
the beam will be attenuated.

399
00:24:04,407 --> 00:24:06,045
It might not buy us any time at all.

400
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:08,675
There’s no way to know,
but it’s no reason not to try.

401
00:24:08,887 --> 00:24:11,355
- Get it done.
- l don’t think that’s your call.

402
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:16,600
Worst-case scenario,
we lose some power from the ZPM ?

403
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:19,964
Worst-case is that we read the numbers
wrong, use up a ton of power...

404
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:23,403
... and the city doesn’t submerge.
Look, as much as l hate to say it...

405
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:25,558
... Zelenka is not infallible.

406
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:30,160
Still, l agree, it’s worth the risk.

407
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:34,565
The city has an automatic submersion
sub-routine in the system.

408
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:37,082
l’Il need to tweak it a bit to work
with one ZPM...

409
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:40,444
... and disable some safety protocols.
Give me an hour.

410
00:24:57,047 --> 00:24:58,685
- It’s been an hour.
- We’re ready.

411
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:01,600
- You’ve got to do the--
- Oh, just...

412
00:25:03,527 --> 00:25:05,006
We are ready.

413
00:25:05,647 --> 00:25:07,000
Good.

414
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:09,363
Get me city-wide.

415
00:25:11,647 --> 00:25:13,205
Attention all personnel.

416
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:16,040
We are about to attempt
to submerge the city.

417
00:25:16,207 --> 00:25:18,846
From what l understand,
it could get a little bumpy...

418
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:21,601
... so this is your last chance
to secure equipment...

419
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:24,076
... and get to the designated
safe areas.

420
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:26,286
We’ve come full circle, eh ?

421
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,320
Yeah. Feels that way.

422
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:34,204
Okay, take us down.

423
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,284
Aye, aye, captain.

424
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:37,960
Shall we ?

425
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:39,526
That’s it. We’re down.

426
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:42,325
The beam still looks pretty serious.

427
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:44,279
l know. Just give me a second to--

428
00:26:44,447 --> 00:26:46,722
- Crap.
- Told you.

429
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:48,366
Thank you, Radek. Very helpful.

430
00:26:48,527 --> 00:26:50,961
- What is it ?
- The beam is breaking through...

431
00:26:51,127 --> 00:26:54,005
- ... more efficiently than we thought.
- The water has no effect ?

432
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:56,727
It’s having an effect,
just not near what we want it to.

433
00:26:56,887 --> 00:27:01,085
That plan took us three hours to execute
and bought us an additional 10 hours.

434
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:02,686
Nine.

435
00:27:03,047 --> 00:27:04,605
Nine.

436
00:27:05,447 --> 00:27:07,756
Okay. What’s the plan ?

437
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:13,041
That was the plan.

438
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,083
l need to learn some science.

439
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:27,362
What for ?

440
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,081
l’m not all that useful
in situations like these.

441
00:27:31,687 --> 00:27:35,521
If we get into a fight or need to break
out of somewhere or kill someone...

442
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,325
... l’m your man.

443
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:40,360
But a laser
attacking the city’s shield...

444
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:42,359
... l don’t know where to chip in.

445
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:45,997
That’s why we’re a team,
like the Fantastic Four.

446
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:52,437
It’s a comic book where superheroes
fight crime and stuff.

447
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:56,885
See, l’d be Mr. Fantastic,
Ronon would be the Thing...

448
00:27:57,047 --> 00:28:00,119
... McKay would be the Human Torch
and you’d be the Invisible Woman.

449
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:02,086
l am not invisible.

450
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:06,280
No, no.
And McKay’s not a human torch.

451
00:28:06,447 --> 00:28:08,403
Well, how come
you get to be Mr. Fantastic ?

452
00:28:08,607 --> 00:28:10,643
Because he was the leader
and l’m the--

453
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:16,806
l’m just saying that they were
a cool team and we’re a cool team...

454
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:19,401
... and they use their strengths to,
you know...

455
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:24,445
l’m gonna go check on McKay.

456
00:28:34,927 --> 00:28:37,725
- Shouldn’t you be bickering ?
- We got nothing to bicker about.

457
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:39,605
He’s run out of bad ideas. Finally.

458
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:42,565
If we survive this,
l’m putting in for a transfer.

459
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:45,201
We both know that you’ve done
your best work under me.

460
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:47,358
Under you ?
l’m my own department head.

461
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:49,398
We both know
that department is a joke.

462
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:52,206
Why don’t you guys just make out
and get it over with ?

463
00:28:52,887 --> 00:28:55,321
l mean, we have, what ?
Under one day to figure out...

464
00:28:55,487 --> 00:28:58,001
... how not to get destroyed
by this satellite thing...

465
00:28:58,207 --> 00:29:00,596
... and you guys are arguing about
who works for who.

466
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:02,837
Every possible scenario
ends in failure.

467
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,363
There is nowhere on the face
of this planet that thing cannot get us.

468
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:12,125
- You don’t think...
- No.

469
00:29:12,287 --> 00:29:13,436
Old girl too banged up ?

470
00:29:13,607 --> 00:29:15,325
The Replicators fixed all the damage.

471
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,478
- We just don’t have the power.
- But ideally.

472
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:19,558
- May be the only way.
- What ?

473
00:29:20,527 --> 00:29:23,963
The drilling platform. Your guys
have it operational down there, right ?

474
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:26,163
It’s close, but we couldn’t
bring it with us.

475
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:27,356
Bring it where ?

476
00:29:27,527 --> 00:29:30,758
- We don’t need to, we just need a boost.
- You might be on to something.

477
00:29:30,927 --> 00:29:32,360
Hey. What’s your idea ? Hey.

478
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:37,927
Well, luckily, the umbilical
is already in place.

479
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:41,636
<i>Yes, I know. Are you capable of</i>
<i>outputting the power we need or not ?</i>

480
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:45,402
We started drilling into the crust. l can
get you 90 percent of the way there.

481
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:48,400
- There goes that plan.
- Can’t the ZPM make up the difference ?

482
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:52,037
No, the ZPM’s a little busy
powering the shield at max.

483
00:29:53,407 --> 00:29:55,637
- What if it didn’t have to ?
- What ?

484
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:58,844
What if we could take
the strain off the shield momentarily ?

485
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:02,400
We’d need about a minute.
Why ? What do you have in mind ?

486
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:05,800
Lantia’s moon has some
sizable satellites itself.

487
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:09,443
Asteroid-like chunks left over from a
second moon that no longer exists.

488
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:13,077
l’d like you to beam up Lorne and get a
flight of F-302s close enough...

489
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:14,441
... to nudge one our way.

490
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:17,485
You wanna bring
an asteroid towards us ?

491
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:20,645
- Is that wise ?
- Well, today it is.

492
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:31,883
All right, guys. We need to get
close enough to clamp on to it.

493
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:34,800
We get enough of us drilled in,
we can fly it like a ship.

494
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:38,602
A really slow ship that’s probably gonna
be a real pain in the ass to steer...

495
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:40,166
... but a ship nonetheless.

496
00:30:52,087 --> 00:30:55,796
Okay, let’s take this big gal
for a stroll.

497
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:58,686
Flights three and four,
begin your burn, full thrust.

498
00:31:09,927 --> 00:31:11,360
Son of a bitch.

499
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:13,518
We might be able
to pull this off after all.

500
00:31:13,727 --> 00:31:15,877
Flights one and two, begin your burn.

501
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:17,122
It’s working ?

502
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:19,755
It’s slow, but they’re bringing
it towards the planet.

503
00:31:19,927 --> 00:31:22,361
They should get here
before our cut-off time.

504
00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:24,440
So we can actually do this ?

505
00:31:24,607 --> 00:31:27,167
l think so, yes.

506
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:29,406
Okay. Time to tell people.

507
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:31,876
Patch me into the PA, please.

508
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:36,317
May l have your attention ?

509
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:40,282
As you all know, we have found
ourselves in a spot of trouble.

510
00:31:40,447 --> 00:31:43,996
The reality is that no matter
where we try to hide on this planet...

511
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:47,477
... the Replicator satellite
will be able to track us.

512
00:31:47,647 --> 00:31:50,559
Therefore Dr. McKay
and Colonel Sheppard have...

513
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:53,366
... come up with a rather ingenious way
for us to escape...

514
00:31:53,527 --> 00:31:56,121
... the satellite’s range altogether.

515
00:31:56,647 --> 00:32:02,279
In the next few hours, we will fire
the city’s stardrive and head into space.

516
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:05,519
Atlantis is leaving this planet.

517
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:17,481
- May l come in ?
- Of course.

518
00:32:17,887 --> 00:32:20,606
All non-essential personnel
have been beamed to the <i>Apollo</i>.

519
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:22,166
Good, good.

520
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:24,597
Has Dr. McKay located
your new home yet ?

521
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:26,644
Yes. M12-578.

522
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:29,924
It’s the closest non-populated,
habitable planet with a large ocean.

523
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:32,362
He’s nervous about trying to land
on solid ground.

524
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:34,842
l can understand that.

525
00:32:37,727 --> 00:32:39,718
Listen, l know
you don’t like me very much--

526
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:41,479
- Colonel, that’s not--
- It’s okay.

527
00:32:41,647 --> 00:32:44,241
To be honest, l’m not that crazy
about you either.

528
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:47,846
Okay.

529
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:52,080
But if l’ve crossed the line here
or there in regards to your command...

530
00:32:52,247 --> 00:32:54,681
... l apologize.
l’m used to making the calls.

531
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:58,805
But l don’t want you to think
l don’t respect you. l do, doctor.

532
00:32:59,007 --> 00:33:01,282
Thank you. l appreciate that.

533
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:05,367
l wish the rest of the military
felt the same way.

534
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:08,003
Well, l can’t speak to that.

535
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:10,965
l do know General O’Neill
is awfully fond of you.

536
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:16,282
Well, l’d better be heading out.

537
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:19,641
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

538
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:21,320
We’re gonna need it.

539
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:32,080
Zelenka is doing a final pass
over all the coding we’ve done...

540
00:33:32,247 --> 00:33:34,044
... but so far it’s looking good.

541
00:33:34,207 --> 00:33:38,280
The underwater drilling platform’s power
output’s dialed up as high as it’Il go.

542
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:40,915
The crew down there
has been beamed up to the <i>Apollo</i>.

543
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:43,806
- We’re gonna wreck that thing.
- What, the drilling platform ?

544
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:47,642
Oh, hell yes, but 30 percent
of our total power requirements...

545
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:50,526
... are gonna be consumed
in the first 10 seconds of flight.

546
00:33:50,687 --> 00:33:54,123
The station will provide us with that
power up until we snap the umbilical.

547
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:56,164
Then we’Il switch over to the ZPM.

548
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:59,922
Now, if we can interrupt
the satellite’s beam...

549
00:34:00,087 --> 00:34:02,237
... which is greatly
taxing our power levels...

550
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:06,480
... we should be able to squeeze out just
enough power to actually do this thing.

551
00:34:06,687 --> 00:34:07,676
How’s Lorne doing ?

552
00:34:07,847 --> 00:34:10,964
He’s making good time. He should be
here in the next 20 minutes.

553
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:14,724
Well, l guess it’s show time.

554
00:34:15,327 --> 00:34:18,603
- You sure you can do this ?
- Fly the city ?

555
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,564
What else could l be talking about ?

556
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,156
l flew a V-22 Osprey once.

557
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:26,999
- Was it as big as a city ?
- You had to use your hands and feet.

558
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:29,476
This one you just have to
sit down and think :

559
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:30,636
« Fly. »

560
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:34,277
Okay. Why don’t you just get in the
chair and start your pre-flight ?

561
00:34:38,727 --> 00:34:40,763
l’m gonna head up
to the control room...

562
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:43,760
... and Zelenka will monitor power output
from the ZPM room.

563
00:34:43,927 --> 00:34:46,885
And good luck.

564
00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:49,166
You too.

565
00:34:56,447 --> 00:34:58,438
Dr. McKay, can you read me ?

566
00:34:58,647 --> 00:35:00,683
Five by five.
Lorne, are you in position ?

567
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:02,764
<i>We’re getting close.</i>
<i>Are you about ready ?</i>

568
00:35:03,287 --> 00:35:04,686
Zelenka, l need a go or no-go.

569
00:35:04,847 --> 00:35:07,884
<i>We’re go. Non-essential systems</i>
<i>are shut down. We’re in the green.</i>

570
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:10,481
- You ready, Sheppard ?
- As l’Il ever be.

571
00:35:10,687 --> 00:35:13,360
Okay, major, make sure she’s moving
as slow as possible.

572
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:15,956
You sure we shouldn’t just lob
this at the satellite ?

573
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:18,761
They’d navigate back into position.
This is our best bet.

574
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:20,236
<i>Copy that.</i>

575
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,122
Package is away and on course.

576
00:35:31,287 --> 00:35:33,118
We’re heading back to the <i>Apollo</i>.

577
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:34,756
<i>Good luck.</i>

578
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:39,966
Okay, calculating travel time
based on current speed.

579
00:35:40,127 --> 00:35:41,924
That’s it. We’re good.

580
00:35:44,407 --> 00:35:46,318
Here goes nothing.

581
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:15,517
Asteroid is entering the beam.

582
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:42,360
<i>We’re on the surface.</i>
<i>Fire the stardrive.</i>

583
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:59,244
We’re not flying high enough.
It’s stalling out.

584
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:02,002
It’s not working.

585
00:37:02,647 --> 00:37:04,763
- What are you doing wrong ?
- <i>Sure, blame me.</i>

586
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:07,925
- We don’t have enough power.
- Oh, sure, blame me.

587
00:37:08,127 --> 00:37:11,164
It’s not working.
What other reasons could there be ?

588
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:13,085
l have no more power to give you.

589
00:37:13,247 --> 00:37:14,919
- Shut it off.
- What ?

590
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:16,321
Lower the shield.

591
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:19,121
We’re about to go into space.
If you plan on breathing...

592
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:21,926
- ... we need the shield.
- Turn it back on at 18,000 feet.

593
00:37:22,127 --> 00:37:24,482
<i>We just need the boost</i>
<i>to get started, no ?</i>

594
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:26,319
That might work.

595
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:37,204
<i>Okay, I did it. Give it all you got.</i>

596
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:55,406
That’s it.

597
00:37:56,247 --> 00:37:58,044
We’re flying.

598
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:20,197
That’s it, time’s up.
Raising the shield.

599
00:38:43,607 --> 00:38:45,802
l’m taking us into hyperspace.

600
00:38:56,327 --> 00:38:58,045
We did it.

601
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:02,486
McKay ? Élizabeth ?

602
00:39:02,647 --> 00:39:05,081
<i>I need a medical team</i>
<i>to the control room stat.</i>

603
00:39:05,247 --> 00:39:07,363
<i>multiple injuries.</i>

604
00:39:22,847 --> 00:39:24,166
Keller, what happened ?

605
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:27,125
Apparently, the beam grazed the tower
and blew out-- Adams.

606
00:39:27,327 --> 00:39:29,887
That guy just has a cut.
Put pressure on it and move on.

607
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:33,642
- There’s a lot of people worse off.
- Élizabeth. Is she gonna be okay ?

608
00:39:33,847 --> 00:39:36,122
She took quite a fall
and her pupils are sluggish.

609
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:39,484
l’m gonna have to get her under
a scanner. l’Il know more in a bit.

610
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:48,602
Oh, God. Are you all right ?

611
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:51,201
- l’ve had worse.
- No one’s helping you ?

612
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:54,006
l told them l didn’t need help.
Other people need it more.

613
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:57,364
- Get this man to the infirmary.
- Yes, sir.

614
00:39:57,607 --> 00:39:58,756
Are you guys all right ?

615
00:39:58,927 --> 00:40:01,885
- All things considered.
- What happened ?

616
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:05,039
Beam grazed the side of the tower
before the shield was closed.

617
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:07,482
- Damage ?
- Minimal, l think.

618
00:40:07,647 --> 00:40:11,196
l was able to get the shield up quickly.
It took the brunt of the blow.

619
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,085
Oh, what now ?

620
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,039
What is happening ?

621
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:19,925
We just dropped out of hyperspace.

622
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:21,845
Have we already reached M12-578 ?

623
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:24,726
No. There’s no way.
It should have taken another few hours.

624
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:26,479
- The hyperdrive shut down.
- Why ?

625
00:40:26,647 --> 00:40:28,046
- l don’t know.
- Get it back up.

626
00:40:28,247 --> 00:40:31,842
l just said l don’t know what’s wrong.
l don’t know what happened.

627
00:40:32,047 --> 00:40:34,003
- Where are we ?
- In the middle of nowhere.

628
00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:36,675
There’s no planets,
no moons, no stargates.

629
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:38,718
How much power do we have ?

630
00:40:41,007 --> 00:40:43,282
- This can’t be right.
- How much ?

631
00:40:44,247 --> 00:40:46,841
At current consumption,
we’ve got 24 hours of power left.

632
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:49,607
After that, there’s no shield.
No shield, no atmosphere.

633
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:51,962
- No atmosphere, we--
- Can we use the stargate ?

634
00:40:52,127 --> 00:40:54,482
It needs to be calibrated
to a specific location.

635
00:40:54,687 --> 00:40:57,201
We are lost. We dropped out
of hyperspace way too soon.

636
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:58,766
l have no idea where we are.
