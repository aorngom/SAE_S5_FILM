http://www.sous-titres.eu/

3
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:32,107
Come on!

4
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:38,757
Is she there?

5
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,100
Right down in front.

6
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,161
It's not their fault, you know.

7
00:01:45,286 --> 00:01:47,690
They just...
They don't know what they're doing.

8
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:49,525
We should leave
before we get caught.

9
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,457
It's happening.

10
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:59,594
Don't they ever get tired of this?
It's so sick.

11
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,125
Don't worry, this will all change.

12
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,457
And she's gonna help change it.

13
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:08,062
Come on! Do it!
Do it! Come on!

14
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,838
Kill! Kill! Kill!

15
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,149
Damn it!

16
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,652
- What happened?
- She derezzed.

17
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,403
She flipped out or something.

18
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,114
She must've defaulted back
to the last copy.

19
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,950
I guess she's not as strong
as you yet.

20
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,363
I have faith in you.

21
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:27,164
She'll be perfect,

22
00:03:27,964 --> 00:03:29,208
'cause you're perfect.

23
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,056
Graystone.
What a surprise.

24
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:46,392
Go frak yourself, Caston.

25
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,035
Are you okay?

26
00:03:57,518 --> 00:03:58,988
Anything happen after I left?

27
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,657
Some more blood and guts.
I logged off a few minutes after you.

28
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,862
Did you check on our girl
after she disappeared?

29
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,039
Frakkers confiscated my Holoband.
I can access her from home.

30
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:10,290
From home?

31
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,062
We're splitting for Gemenon tomorrow.
There'll be plenty of time for tweakage.

32
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,358
But, Zoe...

33
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:16,867
No buts.

34
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:18,173
Not ever.

35
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:20,262
For the one true God

36
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,593
knows all and directs us all.

37
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,580
- So say we all.
- So say we all.

38
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:35,523
Out!

39
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,902
- What?
- It was as out as can be.

40
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,448
- Do we need to turn on the sensors?
- That's exactly what we're gonna do.

41
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:45,200
Serge.
Activate the line sensors, please.

42
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:47,529
- And the auto-umpire.
- <i>Of course, Amanda.</i>

43
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:48,991
Come on, Miss Cheater.

44
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,828
Honey, don't go all immature on me
'cause you know I'm better than you.

45
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:55,621
What's that, cheater?
Sorry, I can't hear you, cheater.

46
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,672
Gods! If only the worlds knew
what a baby you are.

47
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:01,226
<i>Excuse me, Daniel.</i>

48
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,645
<i>There's an urgent message
for you and Amanda</i>

49
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,087
from the Athenian Academy
regarding Zoe.

50
00:05:07,543 --> 00:05:10,100
- Here we go again.
- Let's not prejudge this.

51
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:12,604
We don't even know
what we're dealing with yet.

52
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,856
Holobands at school?

53
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,483
- Cutting class? Defiance!
- Let's just take a deep breath, here.

54
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,944
- Guess you better lock me up.
- Now what did I just say?

55
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,988
You think that's funny, do you?
Maybe you'll think this is funny.

56
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,900
No car privileges,
no phone, no Holoband

57
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,114
and you're grounded for a month.

58
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,687
Come on, now.
Can we just...

59
00:05:30,812 --> 00:05:33,162
We got a big day tomorrow, Z.

60
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:34,836
Your building, remember?

61
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,504
Daddy, I'm sorry, I can't go.
See, I'm grounded.

62
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,716
We're going to make an exception.
Not every day you get a building named.

63
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,166
There's something to be excited about.
Having your name

64
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,685
on the side of the new computer-science
wing at Apollo University

65
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,768
'cause your daddy donated
about a billion cubits

66
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:50,892
- to the alumni fund.
- You're on thin ice already.

67
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,561
Like I even want to be associated
with you and the filthy science...

68
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,020
That dirty science put a roof
over your head, young lady.

69
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,314
That's enough!

70
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:58,524
You are so lucky,

71
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,682
and you have everything in the worlds
that you could possibly want,

72
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:04,306
and all you do is complain
about this family.

73
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,375
You have no idea
what it means to build something

74
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,992
or to work hard for anything.

75
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,654
It's all just been
handed to you, Zoe.

76
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,331
I guess I'll have to learn
how to marry into money.

77
00:06:20,084 --> 00:06:22,909
You are gonna regret that
for the rest of your life.

78
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,214
I can't believe I did that.

79
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:46,822
I think it's okay.
She knows that you didn't mean it.

80
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,473
- I'm sorry.
- No worries.

81
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,209
I just couldn't.

82
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,116
When he pulled out that knife
and started to...

83
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:00,868
Relax.

84
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:04,873
Why do they think
watching something like that...

85
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,352
is fun?

86
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,822
- Because they're asleep.
- No, that's too easy an answer.

87
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,616
I saw their faces.

88
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:15,427
They definitely knew
what they were doing.

89
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,914
- And they loved it.
- You sound just like me.

90
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,593
Gee, I wonder why.

91
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,162
So now what?

92
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,839
Now, we have to make sure
that you don't derez on us again.

93
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,426
I thought I'd solved that
in the fail-safe protocol,

94
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:32,010
but clearly not.

95
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,313
Just don't make me go back
in there again

96
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,491
and you won't have
to worry about it.

97
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,561
It really got to you, didn't it?

98
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,151
I mean, I knew that wasn't real.

99
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,106
Nothing in here is real.

100
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,983
It was the way

101
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:47,995
that people were watching,

102
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,612
the way they drew strength
from what was happening.

103
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,066
It's all right.
It's all right.

104
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,660
I won't make you go back there.

105
00:08:57,761 --> 00:08:59,079
People are really like that?

106
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:01,498
I mean, on the outside,

107
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:03,319
are they really?

108
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:04,543
Some.

109
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:06,879
But that's all gonna change.

110
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,667
And you're gonna help
bring that change.

111
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,145
I thought the whole idea
was to travel light.

112
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,510
Do you have the passports?

113
00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:22,119
Just checking on your ETA tonight.

114
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,998
- <i>I'm thinking about 7:00.</i>
- You always say that.

115
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,710
- It shouldn't be much later than that.
- <i>The party starts at 7:30.</i>

116
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,836
- <i>I know.</i>
- Hi, Dad?

117
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,969
<i>You can't be late.
It's his birthday.</i>

118
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:35,342
Do you wanna put Willie in therapy
for the rest of his life?

119
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,445
All right.
Like I told your mom, sweetie,

120
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,929
I'm headed to court and I should
be done no later than 7:00.

121
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,182
- That's unacceptable.
- <i>That's the best I can do.</i>

122
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,320
<i>You need to promise me
you'll be there on time.</i>

123
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:46,103
- <i>Then you'll be there.</i>
- Unacceptable?

124
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,032
- So do I hear a promise?
- <i>All right.</i>

125
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,358
All right, Your Honor.
I promise.

126
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,351
<i>Now, put your mother back on for me.</i>

127
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:54,453
- We're getting on the Lev.
- What?

128
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:56,947
- Can't hear you. Talk to you at home.
- <i>Wait a minute.</i>

129
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,116
Sweetie,
I want to tell you something.

130
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:02,921
Frak.

131
00:11:07,902 --> 00:11:09,140
Hurry up, Lace.

132
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,668
Come on, Lacy.

133
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,896
I'm sorry. I can't!

134
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,151
Look, it's okay. I promise, okay?
They're gonna welcome us on Gemenon...

135
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,526
It's not like it is here on Caprica.

136
00:11:36,651 --> 00:11:37,863
We'll have a new family.

137
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,615
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,873
I knew she'd back out.

139
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,245
She won't tell anyone
before we're off-world.

140
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:03,972
She won't.

141
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,569
- Whatever.
- Relax.

142
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,183
You're more keyed up than I am.

143
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,359
Remember that guy?

144
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,862
This little creep actually
comes up to me and is like

145
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,630
"She smells like a Tauron. You can smell
them as they walk into the room

146
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:24,452
- "'cause they're dirt eaters."
- I hope you walked away.

147
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,612
I did. After I kicked him
in the balls.

148
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,389
Tamara, you didn't.

149
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,123
He deserved way worse.

150
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:45,806
Are you gonna be like this
all the way to Gemenon, or what?

151
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:48,762
Ben?

152
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:54,132
I'm sorry, Zo.

153
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,191
- It's God's will.
- What?

154
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,197
The one true God
shall drive out the many.

155
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,737
In this senseless tragedy,

156
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:26,207
it's important that you know

157
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,305
that the government of Caprica

158
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,912
takes matters
of terrorism seriously,

159
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,979
and that this case will be pursued

160
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,439
until justice is served.

161
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:38,790
Agent Duram.

162
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,352
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

163
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:46,460
On behalf of the Prime Minister,
let me take this opportunity

164
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,843
to express your government's
deepest sympathy.

165
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,138
This is what we know.

166
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,336
A group known as Soldiers of the One
is responsible for the bombing.

167
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:58,647
Now, while this organization
has been dormant for the past 10 years

168
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:01,657
and we still have a lot of evidence
to sift through,

169
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:04,402
everything points
to their involvement.

170
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:08,323
Now, as I'm sure you all know,
the STO espouses

171
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,884
a monotheistic religious philosophy,

172
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,853
advocating the worship
of a single, all-knowing,

173
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:16,584
all-powerful God.

174
00:15:29,564 --> 00:15:31,504
- You need a light?
- Thank you.

175
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,228
I've never seen you smoke on TV.

176
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:46,196
Company image and all that.

177
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,644
I quit a few years ago, actually.

178
00:15:50,678 --> 00:15:52,410
Started up again last week.

179
00:15:54,116 --> 00:15:55,818
Been trying to quit myself.

180
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:58,156
Joe Adams.

181
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,180
Daniel Graystone.

182
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,427
Oh, sorry.

183
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:04,838
Gloves are symbolic.

184
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,290
They're to keep us

185
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:10,164
away from the world during mourning,
or something like that.

186
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:12,345
I don't even know why they do it.
It's an old custom.

187
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:14,628
At times like these,

188
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,726
old ways are supposed
to help, I guess.

189
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,606
I lost my daughter.

190
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:29,655
Me, too.

191
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,484
And my wife.

192
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:37,505
I could use a cup of coffee.

193
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,003
There's a coffee shop
around the corner.

194
00:16:46,314 --> 00:16:49,083
Zoe walks with Our Mother
Goddess Athena now, Lacy.

195
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,396
She will be...

196
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:54,085
cared for and loved
and cherished for all eternity.

197
00:16:56,563 --> 00:16:58,492
It's not very comforting, is it?

198
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,098
Truth is, it doesn't do much
for me, either.

199
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:03,605
Zoe's gone.

200
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,970
And all the scriptures,
all the prayers,

201
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:09,263
all the sacrifices
offered in the temples,

202
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:11,905
none of these are gonna bring
her back to us. Are they?

203
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,161
I am angry.

204
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:17,902
At the Gods?

205
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:21,732
At whoever did this.

206
00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:23,917
- It's not right.
- No, it's not.

207
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:28,683
To be cut down when her life was...

208
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:31,341
full of so much promise.

209
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:35,136
I should've been on that train.

210
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,443
I should be with Zoe.

211
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,205
I should be dead.

212
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,120
It wasn't your time.

213
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:47,742
The Gods weren't ready
to call your spirit.

214
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,964
They have another purpose
for you here.

215
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:51,099
Me?

216
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,930
Zoe was somebody special.

217
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:55,893
A genius.

218
00:17:57,551 --> 00:17:59,941
The things she could do
with a computer...

219
00:18:01,222 --> 00:18:03,657
She just seemed gifted that way.

220
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:07,073
If you knew of any

221
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:09,796
particular work that Zoe was doing,

222
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,818
any work that you could find,

223
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,885
then perhaps that would be a way
for you to reconnect with her,

224
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,785
to find comfort in discovering her
in a different way.

225
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:22,976
Reconnect?

226
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,027
Amanda?

227
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:05,778
Lacy.

228
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,235
Hi, Dr. Graystone.

229
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,937
Are you all right?

230
00:19:10,538 --> 00:19:12,525
I know this is gonna sound
kind of weird, but...

231
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,197
I was just wondering if I could sit
in her room for a while.

232
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:25,455
Allow entry Lacy Rand.

233
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,413
Welcome, Lacy Rand.

234
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,092
Thank you.

235
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:33,286
Stay as long as you like.

236
00:20:12,364 --> 00:20:13,310
Listen,

237
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,256
I should be going.

238
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:18,903
Thanks for the coffee.

239
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:28,898
Are you okay?

240
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:32,815
Sorry.

241
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:35,882
Sorry.

242
00:20:37,982 --> 00:20:39,939
Listen.
I understand.

243
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,952
In about five seconds,

244
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,243
I'm jumping off a bridge myself.

245
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:53,686
I needed this, you know.

246
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,519
Just to sit

247
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,643
and smoke...

248
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,600
It's the easiest job
I've had all day.

249
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,270
Can I offer you a ride home?

250
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:08,355
No, I live in the city.

251
00:21:09,908 --> 00:21:11,768
Do you follow Pyramid at all?

252
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,816
I've been known to lay a few cubits
on the Bucks, much to my misfortune.

253
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,821
They have had better seasons,
but I've got courtside seats.

254
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,097
Any interest?

255
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,494
Listen, I've got an 11-year-old boy.

256
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,133
- Is there any chance he could join us?
- Absolutely.

257
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:32,858
Listen, this is my private number.

258
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:36,961
Why don't you give me a call,
and we'll set up the details, okay?

259
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:38,604
Thanks.

260
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,154
Is that you?

261
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:45,846
I'm glad you're here.

262
00:22:48,342 --> 00:22:51,703
Something terrible has happened,
hasn't it?

263
00:23:03,705 --> 00:23:04,805
So I'm dead?

264
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,142
She's dead.

265
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:18,534
Where did all this blood come from?

266
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,917
I don't see any wounds on your body.

267
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,529
I don't know.

268
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,547
Maybe the bombing.

269
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,632
The bombing?

270
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,299
But you weren't even there.

271
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:38,629
- You couldn't have been there.
- I know,

272
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:41,495
but still I felt it.

273
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,588
Zoe was working
on a biofeedback protocol.

274
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,464
She wanted me to feel what she felt

275
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:49,782
in real time.

276
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,638
She never got it working exactly,

277
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:54,897
but something happened.

278
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:56,851
It's like I felt her death.

279
00:23:58,588 --> 00:23:59,909
Zoe is dead.

280
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:02,315
What happens to me?

281
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,862
She had some kind of plan for you
once we got to Gemenon,

282
00:24:08,051 --> 00:24:09,897
but I don't even know what that was.

283
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,118
We're not going
to Gemenon anymore, are we?

284
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:23,587
What am I without her?

285
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,299
She's me. I'm her.

286
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,385
I'm all that's left of her.

287
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,679
Help me, Lace. Make me understand.
What am I supposed to do next?

288
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:37,442
I don't have the answers
you want, okay?

289
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:40,770
I didn't even know for sure
if you were gonna still be here.

290
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:42,730
You're scared

291
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:44,940
of me.

292
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,620
- Why?
- I don't know you.

293
00:24:48,745 --> 00:24:49,861
You grew up with me.

294
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,408
I grew up with Zoe Graystone,
and you're not her, okay?

295
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,960
You're something she created.

296
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,620
You're just a thing.

297
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:02,016
Zoe promised me
I'd see the real world one day.

298
00:25:04,182 --> 00:25:05,913
And the crazy thing is,

299
00:25:07,898 --> 00:25:09,757
I already knew
what the real world feels like.

300
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:12,654
I remember it,

301
00:25:14,175 --> 00:25:15,888
just like I remember
growing up with you.

302
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:18,636
It's true.

303
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,183
I've never been to your house,

304
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,230
never played in your room,

305
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,243
never puked in your bathroom

306
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:31,109
or put on your make-up,
or tried on your clothes.

307
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,634
I'm not a person.

308
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,867
I know that.

309
00:25:40,317 --> 00:25:41,705
But I feel like one.

310
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:02,267
It's gonna be okay.

311
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:04,144
It's gonna be okay.

312
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:06,814
Somehow.

313
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:09,797
Somehow.

314
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:12,895
I promise.

315
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:14,530
I promise.

316
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:28,097
Dr. Graystone.

317
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,283
What...
What are you doing?

318
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,008
What?

319
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,708
I gotta go.

320
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,020
Lacy, why are you here?

321
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:06,969
How does the defendant plead?

322
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,378
Not guilty, Your Honor.

323
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:16,592
The clerk will set a date for trial.

324
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,301
Bail will be set at 10,000 Cubits.

325
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:22,472
The defendant is a known member
of the Ha'la'tha crime syndicate.

326
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,843
There is a serious flight risk
to Tauron.

327
00:27:24,968 --> 00:27:27,546
The State strongly recommends
that bail be denied.

328
00:27:27,671 --> 00:27:30,286
I thank the State for its input.
Ruling stands.

329
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,568
Ten thousand Cubits for the bail
and 20,000 for the judge.

330
00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:37,947
The Guatrau is very grateful
for the work you've done for him.

331
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,992
He has pledged to find the nothos
that killed Shannon and Tamara.

332
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,411
Tell the Guatrau
I said thanks, but no.

333
00:27:43,925 --> 00:27:47,327
Blood for blood.
It's the Tauron way.

334
00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:48,582
We're on Caprica now.

335
00:27:48,952 --> 00:27:51,877
Caprica. What has this frakking planet
ever done for us?

336
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,672
- I've got a deposition in an hour.
- We cannot let this pass, Joseph.

337
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,417
We need to find them.

338
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,373
Let me grieve in my own way.

339
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,391
Whatever, my brother.

340
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,187
But I will pray to Mars and all the Gods
for a swift and terrible vengeance

341
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:12,273
to come to those who have torn
your wife and daughter from this world.

342
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,359
There are no Gods, Sam.

343
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:22,408
Then all the more necessary
to make our own justice.

344
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,752
Evaluation protocol 42.

345
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,025
Independent identification,
acquisition, resolution

346
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,924
and execution of conflict.

347
00:28:42,302 --> 00:28:44,680
I had a conversation with
the Minister of Defense this morning.

348
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:48,092
The Prime Minister's
getting a lot of heat.

349
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:51,730
The media is playing up the fact
that we're five years behind schedule

350
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,165
and half-a-billion Cubits
over budget.

351
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,743
He's getting a lot
of pressure to yank

352
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,837
the Cyber Combat Unit
contract from us

353
00:28:58,962 --> 00:29:00,528
and go off-world with it.

354
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,526
They're talking about
going to Vergis.

355
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:24,053
Evaluation demonstration,
proceed in three,

356
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:26,329
two, one.

357
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:16,981
I'll be out for the rest of the day.

358
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:19,569
No calls.

359
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:35,791
- Let's go.
- Willie!

360
00:30:38,324 --> 00:30:39,502
How's school today?

361
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:40,847
All right.

362
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:42,381
I got off of work early

363
00:30:43,069 --> 00:30:45,919
and thought
maybe we could walk home together.

364
00:30:46,229 --> 00:30:48,335
- All right.
- Stop off for a shaved ice.

365
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,889
- You like that?
- Sure.

366
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:53,858
I met a man...

367
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,763
who offered to take us

368
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:57,980
to see the Buccaneers play.
What do you think?

369
00:30:58,452 --> 00:30:59,466
Sure.

370
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:01,766
I thought you liked Pyramid.

371
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:03,776
Sort of.

372
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:06,068
Courtside seats.

373
00:31:07,777 --> 00:31:09,679
Could Tsattie come with us, too?

374
00:31:10,545 --> 00:31:11,902
I think...

375
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,487
I want to give Grandma a night off.

376
00:31:15,532 --> 00:31:17,049
It's a guys' night out.

377
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,614
We haven't been spending
much time together lately.

378
00:31:21,165 --> 00:31:22,190
Ever.

379
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:29,947
Do you think they still feel pain?

380
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:31,663
Sorry?

381
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:35,117
Mom and Tamara, where they are.

382
00:31:35,242 --> 00:31:37,019
Do you still think they hurt?

383
00:32:54,236 --> 00:32:56,542
- What?
- <i>I know you said no calls.</i>

384
00:32:57,086 --> 00:32:58,809
<i>Tomas Vergis is on Caprica.</i>

385
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,853
<i>He's meeting
Defense Minister Chambers today.</i>

386
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,689
<i>Obviously he's making a play
for the U-87 contract.</i>

387
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,626
<i>I hate to say I told you so.</i>

388
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:07,801
His company

389
00:33:08,172 --> 00:33:09,528
is years behind us.

390
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:10,614
<i>Word is,</i>

391
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:13,722
<i>Vergis has developed
a Meta-Cognitive Processor.</i>

392
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,286
We've been trying to crack
this for a decade.

393
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,066
Suddenly he's got it?

394
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:21,467
- I don't think so.
- <i>Vergis is going to tell Chambers</i>

395
00:33:21,592 --> 00:33:23,467
<i>that he has an MCP,
that much I know.</i>

396
00:33:23,592 --> 00:33:24,831
<i>If it's true...</i>

397
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:26,837
<i>if they </i><i>have a viable,</i>

398
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,169
- <i>independent artificial brain...</i>
- Can't be.

399
00:33:29,294 --> 00:33:30,924
<i>then the only thing they need is...</i>

400
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,843
- <i>a robotic body to put it in.</i>
- I know.

401
00:33:33,356 --> 00:33:35,346
First thing is
find out if it's true.

402
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:39,015
Saying you've got the MCP is one thing,
actually having it, is another.

403
00:33:39,216 --> 00:33:40,555
See what you can find out.

404
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:41,859
And, Cyrus...

405
00:33:42,758 --> 00:33:44,708
Did you ever hear of these...

406
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,358
virtual nightclubs
for kids, teenagers?

407
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:49,443
They hack the Holobands
and create these...

408
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,490
places where they can go

409
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:53,306
and do things.

410
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,302
<i>It's only been
an underground phenomenon for about...</i>

411
00:33:56,538 --> 00:33:57,703
<i>five years now.</i>

412
00:33:58,001 --> 00:33:59,033
<i>Why?</i>

413
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:02,658
Keep me posted on Vergis.

414
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,533
- Morning.
- Morning.

415
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:09,000
William was up all night.
Again.

416
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,293
I know.

417
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:14,653
I don't know what to do with him.

418
00:35:15,131 --> 00:35:17,114
Let him experience his roots.

419
00:35:17,355 --> 00:35:19,410
Take him home to Tauron.

420
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:22,291
It's what my daughter
would have wanted.

421
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:24,830
Will was born on Caprica.
This is his home.

422
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,240
Let's not get into this, will you?

423
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:28,752
Not now.

424
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:31,877
Hey, kiddo.

425
00:35:32,753 --> 00:35:34,256
- Good morning.
- Morning.

426
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,943
- How are you?
- Good.

427
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:39,912
There's an extra slice
of that cherry cake you like so much.

428
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,048
Awesome.

429
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,538
Are you gonna take me to school?

430
00:35:43,663 --> 00:35:45,641
It's on my way to work.
I'll take you.

431
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,678
Agent Duram,
Global Defense Department.

432
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,116
I'm wondering
if you have a few minutes.

433
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,079
What for?

434
00:36:07,023 --> 00:36:10,584
As you probably know, I'm investigating
the attack on the MLMT train.

435
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,366
Should I know that?

436
00:36:14,197 --> 00:36:15,005
Sorry.

437
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:18,017
I've been avoiding the news lately.

438
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,802
That's completely understandable.

439
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,039
May I?

440
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:27,716
It's about your daughter, Zoe.

441
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,209
Was there anything in her behavior

442
00:36:32,334 --> 00:36:34,942
before the incident
that seemed unusual to you?

443
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:41,275
She was...

444
00:36:42,252 --> 00:36:43,268
angry,

445
00:36:43,596 --> 00:36:44,596
defiant,

446
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,085
rude, vulgar,

447
00:36:46,717 --> 00:36:48,205
obnoxious, unreasonable,

448
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:51,583
just your typical 16-year-old girl.

449
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,260
And how would you describe
her circle of friends?

450
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:58,257
- Was there an anti...
- Would you cut to the chase, Agt Duram.

451
00:36:59,513 --> 00:37:00,813
We have evidence

452
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:04,304
that we believe positively
links your daughter to the bombers.

453
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,102
I'm sorry.

454
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,738
You think that Zoe
knew one of the terrorists?

455
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:13,689
We think that Zoe
might have been one of the terrorists.

456
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:19,069
My daughter didn't have
a political bone in her body.

457
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:22,732
Her biggest concerns in life were...

458
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:26,202
partying with her friends and finding
creative ways to piss off her parents.

459
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,412
I understand how upsetting
this must be for you.

460
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,254
We think that was sent

461
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,198
from your daughter's computer sheet.

462
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,801
The message was transmitted
just before the explosion,

463
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,386
but never had a chance
to uplink to the server.

464
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,798
It took a fair amount
of digital forensics to reconstruct it.

465
00:37:49,845 --> 00:37:51,560
It sounds like a last message to me,

466
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,855
like someone who knows the end
is near and wants to make amends.

467
00:37:56,295 --> 00:37:57,302
Get out.

468
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,029
Here's my card.

469
00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:07,540
If you think of anything,
please don't hesitate to call me.

470
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,880
<i>Welcome, Lacy Rand.</i>

471
00:38:21,628 --> 00:38:22,740
May I come in?

472
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:25,111
<i>Your security authorization
is still valid.</i>

473
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:26,316
<i>Please enter.</i>

474
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:28,404
Thanks.

475
00:38:30,835 --> 00:38:32,747
I'm just gonna go to Zoe's room.

476
00:38:32,872 --> 00:38:33,972
<i>As you wish.</i>

477
00:38:59,372 --> 00:39:00,502
Looking for this?

478
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:09,075
You'll pardon the way I look,
but I've been up all night

479
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,978
trying to crack one of the better
security codes I've ever run up against.

480
00:39:13,676 --> 00:39:15,065
I've been to the V-Club.

481
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:18,265
I've seen her.

482
00:39:19,431 --> 00:39:21,095
I saw her go into a room

483
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,336
with an infinity symbol on the door.

484
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,570
I don't have any idea
what this means

485
00:39:25,956 --> 00:39:28,657
or how it's even possible,
but I have the feeling that you do.

486
00:39:29,462 --> 00:39:32,445
- I'm sorry, Dr. Graystone...
- I want to see her, Lacy.

487
00:39:33,493 --> 00:39:35,122
Whatever she is,

488
00:39:35,745 --> 00:39:37,282
I need to know.

489
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:42,679
I need to know.

490
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:48,552
I'm glad you came to see me, Joseph.

491
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,866
We grieve for your terrible loss.

492
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:53,071
Thank you for saying so, Guatrau.

493
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:55,700
There's a delicate matter
I need your help on.

494
00:39:56,808 --> 00:39:58,565
If I can, you know I will.

495
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,680
There is a man,

496
00:40:00,805 --> 00:40:02,170
an important man,

497
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,770
who has conveniently forgotten

498
00:40:04,895 --> 00:40:07,071
how he got to be so important.

499
00:40:08,812 --> 00:40:12,180
Regrettably, he is embarking
on an enterprise that...

500
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,788
will cause a great deal of distress,

501
00:40:15,198 --> 00:40:17,289
not only to my personal interest,

502
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,229
but to many of my colleagues.

503
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:22,180
This...

504
00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:23,712
I cannot sanction.

505
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:25,913
So action must be taken.

506
00:40:27,184 --> 00:40:28,925
You want me to threaten him?

507
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,046
I'd like this matter to be resolved

508
00:40:31,171 --> 00:40:32,771
in a civilized manner,

509
00:40:33,638 --> 00:40:37,434
and I can think of no other Tauron
as civilized as you, Tse'Jospeh.

510
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,138
And who is this I'm...

511
00:40:42,516 --> 00:40:44,066
to negotiate with?

512
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,970
Caprica's Minister of Defense,
Val Chambers.

513
00:40:52,214 --> 00:40:54,814
And if this negotiation
does not go well?

514
00:40:55,674 --> 00:40:57,871
It's best not to speak
of such things.

515
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,708
May I've some time
to think about this?

516
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:06,755
Of course.

517
00:41:07,587 --> 00:41:08,923
But not too much time.

518
00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:19,642
What goes on here?

519
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:22,021
Pretty much anything.
No limits, that's the motto.

520
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,606
Down there is the kill zone.
Get a gun, get 5 guns,

521
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,278
walk in and start shooting.

522
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,949
Shoot your friends,
shoot the Prime Minister,

523
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:32,780
shoot yourself, whatever.

524
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:35,267
Back that way are the group sex
and drug dens.

525
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:38,154
Keep going past that
and you'll find the really gross stuff.

526
00:41:43,113 --> 00:41:44,392
This is a fight room.

527
00:41:44,517 --> 00:41:46,795
You can frakking beat
anyone you want.

528
00:41:49,988 --> 00:41:50,799
Kill her!

529
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:52,801
So what's this?

530
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,589
Human sacrifice.

531
00:41:55,497 --> 00:41:56,303
What?

532
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:57,690
Virgins.

533
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,074
They offer them to Hecate,
Goddess of the Underworld.

534
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,818
When I created the Holoband,
this isn't exactly what I had in mind.

535
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:06,237
Right.

536
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:08,897
The porn sites were the first ones
to license that technology.

537
00:42:09,022 --> 00:42:10,801
That's different, that's for adults.

538
00:42:10,926 --> 00:42:12,917
Zoe always said
you can rationalize anything.

539
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:15,071
So what?
You and Zoe came here...

540
00:42:15,529 --> 00:42:17,283
- for sex?
- At first.

541
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,895
We used the group sex rooms
like everyone else,

542
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,746
but then after
Ben showed us the way,

543
00:42:22,225 --> 00:42:23,582
showed us <i>the </i>way,

544
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,542
we saw this place for what it was.

545
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,918
- Trash.
- The way?

546
00:42:29,107 --> 00:42:31,131
There is good
and there is evil in this world.

547
00:42:31,832 --> 00:42:34,028
There is a right
and there is a wrong,

548
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,739
but only through the one true God
can we know the difference.

549
00:42:38,407 --> 00:42:39,473
And Zoe knew.

550
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:41,390
Because Zoe knew God,

551
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,670
and God touched her heart,

552
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,995
and gave her the ability to create

553
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:48,941
life itself.

554
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:16,094
Why did you bring him here?

555
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:18,696
He needs you, Zo.

556
00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:27,646
Hi, Daddy.

557
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,623
I thought that was you
at the club yesterday.

558
00:43:32,748 --> 00:43:34,911
Thought I got away
before you saw me.

559
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,740
Guess I wouldn't make
a very good spy.

560
00:43:40,274 --> 00:43:41,624
You're an avatar,

561
00:43:42,521 --> 00:43:44,621
a virtual representation of Zoe.

562
00:43:46,163 --> 00:43:47,165
Nothing more.

563
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,680
I'm a little more than that.

564
00:43:51,173 --> 00:43:52,670
A lot more, actually.

565
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:54,745
I'm...

566
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:56,964
sort of her.

567
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,644
Crazy as that sounds,

568
00:44:01,418 --> 00:44:02,418
I am her.

569
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,850
I'm Zoe Graystone.

570
00:44:08,022 --> 00:44:09,122
Zoe is dead.

571
00:44:09,937 --> 00:44:10,963
I know,

572
00:44:12,131 --> 00:44:14,044
and I'm so sorry about that,

573
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,307
more than you can know.

574
00:44:17,598 --> 00:44:18,738
She was like...

575
00:44:20,213 --> 00:44:21,866
my twin sister.

576
00:44:24,225 --> 00:44:27,078
That's not right, either.
She was more than that.

577
00:44:28,322 --> 00:44:29,481
We were like...

578
00:44:30,412 --> 00:44:32,175
echoes of one another.

579
00:44:34,033 --> 00:44:35,826
- It's hard to describe.
- So...

580
00:44:37,902 --> 00:44:39,602
so what is this, really?

581
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:43,213
Did Zoe hack some kind
of rudimentary emulation software?

582
00:44:43,338 --> 00:44:45,307
She said it was a combination
of hacks and some...

583
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:47,860
That's enough.
What was the purpose of this thing?

584
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:51,146
- I'm not a thing.
- I'm not going to argue with an image.

585
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:56,066
The human brain contains
roughly 300 megabytes of information.

586
00:44:56,362 --> 00:44:58,654
Not much,
when you get right down to it.

587
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,010
The question isn't how to store it.
It's how to access it.

588
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:08,338
You can't download a personality.
There's no way to translate the data.

589
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,430
But the information
being held in our heads

590
00:45:11,555 --> 00:45:14,138
is available in other databases.

591
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,797
People leave more than footprints
as they travel through life.

592
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:22,486
Medical scans, DNA profiles,
psych evaluations,

593
00:45:22,611 --> 00:45:24,548
school records, e-mails,

594
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,377
recording videolaudio,
CAT scans, genetic typing,

595
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,269
synaptic records,
security cameras, test results,

596
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,271
shopping records, talent shows,

597
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,449
ball games, traffic tickets,
restaurant bills,

598
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:40,190
phone records, music lists,
movie tickets, TV shows.

599
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,907
Even prescriptions
for birth control.

600
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:01,358
You do not tell the Guatrau
you need time to think about anything.

601
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:04,426
You say, "Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
May I have another?"

602
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,960
You swore allegiance
to him, Sam. Not me.

603
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,702
You have no problem
taking his cubits.

604
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:12,686
I don't care if he put me
through law school or not.

605
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,062
I'm tired of doing
his dirty work for him.

606
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,535
You just fire me
if you don't like it.

607
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:23,447
You of all people should know
that the Ha'la'tha does not fire people.

608
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:25,598
They bury them.

609
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,043
I remember that.

610
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,218
You put me up on your shoulders so
I could see the band as it marched by,

611
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:43,514
but we were standing
under a lamppost,

612
00:46:44,459 --> 00:46:47,670
And I smacked my head
so hard I saw stars.

613
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:51,766
Took you to the emergency room
just as a precaution.

614
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:53,393
I hated that.

615
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,229
The lights and the doctors and...

616
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,065
that smell.

617
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,397
But I remember you holding
my hand the whole time.

618
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,501
You said you wouldn't let go.

619
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,778
She could've programmed
those memories into you.

620
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,212
But it is

621
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,190
a lot of detail
for such a minor event.

622
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:25,007
She could've found a way to translate
synaptic records into usable data.

623
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:27,025
- She did.
- Yes, but...

624
00:47:27,165 --> 00:47:29,319
a person is much more than just...

625
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:32,397
a bunch of usable data.

626
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,820
You might be a good imitation,
you might be a very good imitation,

627
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,799
but you're still just an imitation.

628
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:40,256
A copy.

629
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,823
I don't feel like a copy.

630
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,264
Daddy...

631
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:55,805
Can I...

632
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:03,143
May I hold you, Zoe?

633
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,880
What're you doing to her?

634
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,050
Stop it, Dr. Graystone! Stop!

635
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,207
What did you do to her?

636
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,724
I captured the code Zoe
used to create the avatar.

637
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,686
- Why?
- It's time for you to leave.

638
00:49:08,439 --> 00:49:09,439
Serge,

639
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,198
cancel Lacy Rand's
security clearance.

640
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:13,683
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

641
00:49:23,254 --> 00:49:26,421
Sister Clarice,
you wanted to see me?

642
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,071
Lacy, I'd like you
to meet Agent Duram.

643
00:49:31,329 --> 00:49:32,385
Hello, Miss Rand.

644
00:49:33,092 --> 00:49:34,887
Agent Duram has a few questions
to ask.

645
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,592
Lacy, why don't you have a seat?

646
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,153
I understand you were friends
with Ben Stark.

647
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:53,105
Sure. I knew Ben.

648
00:49:54,435 --> 00:49:55,450
We have evidence

649
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:58,243
to suggest that he was involved
in the attack on the lev.

650
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,921
That's crazy.

651
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:05,084
I have to agree with Lacy.
That's an absurd allegation, Mr. Duram.

652
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:08,129
I'm afraid we have forensic evidence
linking him to the bombing.

653
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,675
Were you aware of his involvement
with the Soldiers of the One?

654
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,969
Ben Stark was a good and decent boy.

655
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,996
He would never be involved
with some kind of a...

656
00:50:18,121 --> 00:50:19,872
terrorist organization.

657
00:50:20,078 --> 00:50:22,678
Lacy, did you know
that Ben was involved?

658
00:50:26,342 --> 00:50:27,523
And I don't believe it.

659
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,893
- What about Zoe Graystone?
- What about her?

660
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,820
Were you aware that she was a member
of Soldiers of the One, as well?

661
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:51,342
She's just gone through
an incredibly traumatic event.

662
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:55,677
Where does the Athenian Academy stand
on the question of monotheism, Sister?

663
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,637
Are we under investigation now?

664
00:50:58,455 --> 00:50:59,472
Just a question.

665
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:04,310
The Academy is dedicated
to following the path of the Gods,

666
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,895
the Goddess Athena
being our patroness.

667
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,649
We are, however,
open to all forms of worship,

668
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,359
including belief in a singular God.

669
00:51:12,964 --> 00:51:14,153
That's very tolerant.

670
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,949
And how many of your students
are practicing monotheists?

671
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:20,326
You know I can't answer that.

672
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,328
It doesn't concern you, Sister,

673
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,982
that kind of absolutist view
of the universe?

674
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:29,753
Right and wrong determined solely
by a single all-knowing, powerful being

675
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,921
whose judgment cannot be questioned,

676
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,766
and in whose name
the most horrendous of acts

677
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:36,501
can be sanctioned without appeal?

678
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,469
You seem to know a great deal
about that.

679
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:40,847
Know your enemy, Sister Clarice.

680
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:43,543
Love your enemy, Agent Duram.

681
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,811
That is what we followers
of Athena believe.

682
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,290
I'll be in touch.

683
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,386
Worthless bunch of losers.

684
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,655
You know, I should've remembered
you own the Buccaneers.

685
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,958
A fantasy since I was a kid.

686
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,260
Now, William, what'd you think?

687
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:37,763
I think Jenkins tanked the game.

688
00:52:38,933 --> 00:52:41,648
Maybe you should come
and tell him yourself. Come on.

689
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:45,268
- Tell me what, Dr. Graystone?
- This young man would like to discuss

690
00:52:45,393 --> 00:52:47,579
the finer points of midcourt defense
with you, Rod.

691
00:52:47,993 --> 00:52:50,413
Sure, Daniel, no problem.
What's your name, kid?

692
00:52:51,216 --> 00:52:53,912
- Willie, I'm Rod.
- I know who you are, Mr. Jenkins.

693
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:55,893
So, how do you think we did tonight?

694
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,406
Not that great.

695
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,285
Keep it positive.
You're among champions here, pal.

696
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,262
I'd like to speak with your father if
you can hang out with the team.

697
00:53:03,553 --> 00:53:05,123
- Is that okay?
- Sure.

698
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,659
This is Sean. If you want something,
anything, you just ask him.

699
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,762
- Now, you behave, Son.
- Okay, Dad.

700
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:14,706
That was the first time I've seen him
really light up since the accident,

701
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:17,736
so thank you so much for doing this.

702
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,661
Please, please, it's easy.

703
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:22,264
And you?

704
00:53:23,258 --> 00:53:24,450
How are you holding up?

705
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,087
You know us Taurons.

706
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,472
We're nothing if not a stoic people.

707
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:38,237
Do you mind if I ask you

708
00:53:38,803 --> 00:53:41,355
a somewhat strange
and personal question?

709
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:49,188
What would you do if you had the chance
to be with your daughter again?

710
00:53:58,268 --> 00:53:59,944
You don't have to answer .
I'm sorry.

711
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:04,197
- It was a personal question.
- I just hadn't thought about it.

712
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:14,792
Most of my family, including my parents,
died in the Tauron civil war,

713
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,185
so my brother and I
came here as orphans.

714
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:22,131
When we arrived,
they drove us to this orphanage.

715
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:27,102
I remember this field of wildflowers
on the side of the road.

716
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:32,068
It might seem strange to a Caprican,
but there are no flowers on Tauron.

717
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:34,303
Not one.

718
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:38,648
It was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen in my life.

719
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,193
All the colors,

720
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,805
the petals, the softness, and...

721
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,284
I wept

722
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:50,787
openly

723
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,986
for the first and last time.

724
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:58,312
So I guess that's
what I'd tell Tamara,

725
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:02,507
to find those things in life
that make you cry,

726
00:55:03,872 --> 00:55:04,926
that make you feel.

727
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,822
Because they're what make you human.

728
00:55:10,618 --> 00:55:12,641
I guess that's what I'd tell Tamara

729
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:14,393
if I could.

730
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:32,548
William, I'm guessing you'd like
to see the game room, yes?

731
00:55:35,146 --> 00:55:36,165
<i>Yes, Daniel?</i>

732
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,960
Escort William to the game room.
Show him how to use the equipment.

733
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:40,902
<i>Right this way, William.</i>

734
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:47,334
It's quite a place you got here.

735
00:55:47,459 --> 00:55:51,156
I still miss tinkering down
in my parents' basement, you know?

736
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,015
This all seems a bit much.

737
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,616
Ever tried one of these?

738
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,245
I'm not much for that stuff.

739
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,297
Indulge me, please.

740
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:20,585
Sure.

741
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,988
Just step right in here,

742
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:24,913
if you would. Right there.

743
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:27,682
This is what happens
when you buy a Holoband

744
00:56:27,807 --> 00:56:30,219
- at any retail store.
- I saw it on the news.

745
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:34,423
Basically, I'm going to scan
your image for your avatar,

746
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:38,405
which is, in essence,
a virtual copy of you, physically.

747
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,296
- Now, just stand still.
- Okay.

748
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:44,005
You're gonna feel a slight
tingling sensation in your skin,

749
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:46,540
but I assure you, it's not harmful.

750
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:58,196
You can step out now.

751
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:00,682
There you are.

752
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:05,063
- I've looked better.
- If you will just sit here,

753
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,713
we are ready to go.

754
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:10,566
Now, just relax,

755
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,269
close your eyes.

756
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:15,373
Remember, it's going to seem real,

757
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:16,515
very real,

758
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:19,176
but it's all virtual.

759
00:57:21,297 --> 00:57:22,313
Just an illusion.

760
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,204
It takes getting used to.

761
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:45,528
Can I talk?

762
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:49,203
I guess I can.
Where are we?

763
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:52,718
Inside a very basic
computer program.

764
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,737
I haven't had time to do
any decorating yet.

765
00:57:55,862 --> 00:57:57,112
Step over here.

766
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,658
Just tell yourself to walk.

767
00:58:14,377 --> 00:58:15,658
What are you doing, Daddy?

768
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:18,227
Working.

769
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:21,363
Joseph,

770
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,099
this is Zoe,

771
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:28,203
my daughter.

772
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,545
My Gods.

773
00:58:49,037 --> 00:58:50,276
Frak!

774
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,529
What the hell is this?

775
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,823
- What twisted thing are you doing?
- Nothing twisted.

776
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,435
- And I didn't do it. Zoe did.
- Zoe did?

777
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:02,772
Turns out she was kind
of a chip off the old block.

778
00:59:02,897 --> 00:59:04,189
That's not her.

779
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,876
Our daughters, they're gone.

780
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:08,119
You know this.

781
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:12,010
But what if they could come back?

782
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:13,915
You're insane.

783
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:17,262
Do you know what your brain is, Joseph?
A database and a processor, that's all.

784
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,388
Information and a way to use it.

785
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:23,101
And what my daughter figured out
was how to harness all the information

786
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,271
that made her who and what she was.
It's genius, really.

787
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,732
She took a search engine and turned it
into a way to cheat death.

788
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:32,335
No, it's... It's an illusion.
You said so yourself.

789
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:34,546
You're right.
You're right. She's a copy.

790
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:38,220
But she's a perfect copy
in every way.

791
00:59:38,345 --> 00:59:40,910
- It doesn't make her your daughter.
- There's an axiom in my business,

792
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:43,746
"A difference that makes no difference,
is no difference."

793
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,538
She looks like Zoe,

794
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:48,626
she talks like Zoe, she thinks like Zoe,
remembers her childhood,

795
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:52,501
has all the same likes, dislikes,
flaws, strengths, all of it.

796
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:55,956
Who's to say her soul
wasn't copied, too?

797
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:58,751
- You can't copy a soul.
- And you would know that how?

798
00:59:59,966 --> 01:00:01,931
How can you prove
or disprove that idea?

799
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:05,844
Look, I know what I know, okay?
And I know you can't copy a person.

800
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,512
I know that she's my daughter.

801
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:09,647
I know that she is my daughter,

802
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,104
and I know it in the only place
that matters. Here.

803
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:17,355
The difference between her and the Zoe
that lived in this house is just that.

804
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,074
She lived in this house
instead of a virtual world.

805
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,910
I want to bring her here.

806
01:00:23,947 --> 01:00:26,931
I want her to live
in this world once more.

807
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:30,134
I want to hold her in my arms,
and I want to kiss her,

808
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:33,045
and I want her to feel
the sun shine on her face.

809
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:38,300
I want her to see the flowers
at the side of the road, Joseph.

810
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:43,348
But for me to be able to transfer
the virtual representation of Zoe

811
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,417
you just saw in there
into a physical body out here,

812
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:49,978
I need a very special,
very particular piece of equipment.

813
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,813
A physical body...
What do you mean? Like a robot?

814
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,161
"Robot" is a crude name
for what we're talking about.

815
01:00:55,286 --> 01:00:57,828
- This is a cybernetic life-form node.
- It's still a machine!

816
01:00:57,953 --> 01:01:00,262
- It's artificial skin, eyes, hair.
- It's cold. It's dead.

817
01:01:00,387 --> 01:01:02,166
Yes, but these are surface details.

818
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:04,335
That's what we always tell
our children, isn't it?

819
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,203
What matters is on the inside.

820
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,908
The device that I need is called
a Meta-Cognitive Processor.

821
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:15,303
The problem is, there's only one company
that has this device,

822
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,215
and it's not mine.

823
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:22,044
The only one in existence
is owned by the Vergis Corporation.

824
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,471
- Ever heard of them?
- Sure.

825
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:31,227
I know your connection
to the Ha'la'tha.

826
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,014
I know who and what you are.

827
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:39,215
I know about the pit in your stomach.
I know about the sleepless nights.

828
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:42,087
I know about the wishing and praying
to whatever Gods will listen

829
01:01:42,212 --> 01:01:44,198
that you could have everything back
the way it was.

830
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,660
Well, I can bring Tamara back.

831
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:49,647
I can bring her back.
You can see your daughter again.

832
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:51,707
Isn't that worth whatever price
you have to pay?

833
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:54,118
If you leave now,
you'll never know for sure.

834
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:55,497
You'll always wonder.

835
01:01:55,622 --> 01:01:59,157
You'll walk by her room,
you'll see her pictures on the wall,

836
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:02,026
and you'll ask yourself every day
for the rest of your life

837
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,386
whether you had a chance
to bring her back.

838
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,666
Now, if I'm wrong,

839
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,802
have me beat up, have me killed.
I don't care.

840
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:12,382
But if I'm right...

841
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:16,224
If I'm right

842
01:02:17,184 --> 01:02:19,673
and you have a chance
to see your daughter again,

843
01:02:21,257 --> 01:02:22,862
possibly even your wife,

844
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,870
isn't it worth trying?

845
01:02:51,596 --> 01:02:52,636
Good morning.

846
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:00,904
Morning.

847
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:03,486
What's this?

848
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,739
I made you breakfast.

849
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,715
You made breakfast?

850
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:11,213
Excuse me.
I used to cook for you all the time.

851
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:13,996
<i>Eggs  la Graystone,</i>

852
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:16,818
wild-mushroom sausage,
rosemary bread

853
01:03:17,563 --> 01:03:19,878
and, of course, your black tea.

854
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:24,297
Enjoy.

855
01:03:26,838 --> 01:03:27,845
I miss you.

856
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,575
We can make it through this.

857
01:03:42,274 --> 01:03:43,354
We can.

858
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:46,865
Together.

859
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:49,890
Just the two of us.

860
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:04,167
Thank you.

861
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,509
Eat,

862
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:11,129
and maybe later on,
I'll give you a chance

863
01:04:11,424 --> 01:04:13,172
to lose to me in straight sets.

864
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,614
I need a favor, Sam.

865
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:24,265
I don't even know if it can be done,

866
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,525
but I need something stolen.

867
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,332
Really? You?

868
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:36,481
- I'm listening.
- From the Vergis Corporation.

869
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:37,765
On Tauron.

870
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,772
Tomas Vergis is a good friend
of the Guatrau's.

871
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:45,490
I doubt he'd sanction stealing
from a friend.

872
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:48,352
What if I agreed to deliver
the message he wanted

873
01:04:49,128 --> 01:04:50,344
to Minister Chambers?

874
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,722
Isn't this one of those
big lines of yours

875
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,052
you're always so worried
about crossing, Joseph?

876
01:04:57,246 --> 01:04:58,936
Are you sure you really
want to do that?

877
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,453
You're not actually
threatening me, are you?

878
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:11,697
Minister Chambers,
I'm simply delivering a message.

879
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,952
There's no threat, real or implied,
in anything I've told you.

880
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:22,626
You Taurons, you've got stones,
I'll give you that.

881
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,196
Are you making
a racial comment, sir?

882
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,256
No more than you're making a threat.

883
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:31,064
Let's be clear.

884
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:33,929
I don't like your boss,

885
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,892
I don't like your planet
and I don't like your people,

886
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:41,834
so you crawl under that rock
where your Guatrau lives,

887
01:05:42,377 --> 01:05:45,883
and you tell him that not only will
I not be pressured or blackmailed,

888
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:49,570
but the government of Caprica is going
to take a very special interest in him,

889
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:51,721
his business

890
01:05:53,414 --> 01:05:54,908
and his low-life lawyers.

891
01:05:59,537 --> 01:06:01,323
Perhaps you should sleep on it.

892
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,941
Deliver the message, errand boy,

893
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:06,673
word for word.

894
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,013
Goodbye, Minister Chambers.
Have a safe journey.

895
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:20,183
I'm not going anyplace,
you frakking dirt-eater.

896
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:39,605
Hey there, you.

897
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:41,775
Always in the books.

898
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,473
Missed you at the club last night.

899
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:47,933
- Missed you for two hours.
- Sorry.

900
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:50,560
I haven't been much
of a friend lately, have I?

901
01:09:51,852 --> 01:09:53,271
That's fine.
It doesn't matter.

902
01:09:57,452 --> 01:09:58,609
Look,

903
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:00,744
I found something.

904
01:10:01,804 --> 01:10:03,490
It changed my life.

905
01:10:04,104 --> 01:10:05,443
I want to share it with you.

906
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:06,644
Changed your life?

907
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,123
Sounds stupid?

908
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:10,383
Look, it's not.

909
01:10:11,064 --> 01:10:12,171
It's real.

910
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:14,376
Come with us.

911
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,962
- To what?
- A prayer meeting.

912
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,548
- Because I don't go to enough of those.
- This one is different.

913
01:10:19,717 --> 01:10:20,946
You pray, Lace,

914
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:24,148
but your Gods don't answer.

915
01:10:24,449 --> 01:10:26,096
You hurt, but your Gods don't heal.

916
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:29,306
You go to the V-Club
for sex and sin,

917
01:10:29,506 --> 01:10:31,434
but it doesn't fill
the void in your soul.

918
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,594
There is truth in the world, Lace.

919
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:41,735
There is a right
and there is a wrong.

920
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:44,447
And there is a God,

921
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:48,685
a God who knows the difference.

922
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:02,100
That's how it started.

923
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:06,434
That's how I got involved.

924
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:11,015
I didn't know what to do, Sister,

925
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:14,179
where to go.

926
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:17,772
You did the right thing
by coming to see me.

927
01:11:21,643 --> 01:11:22,485
I, too,

928
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,645
used to feel a void in my soul.

929
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:30,427
I, too, once hungered
to know right from wrong.

930
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:35,489
But not anymore.

931
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:51,723
Sister?

932
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:54,604
You're not alone.

933
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,826
So then, Ben did have something
to do with the bombing.

934
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,359
He was the terrorist.

935
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:22,580
Labels like "terrorist" are what
this corrupt and decadent culture

936
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:26,091
calls people who are trying to fight
the real evil in this world.

937
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:30,287
Ben was eager to strike against all that
was slowly choking this world to death,

938
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:31,848
and so he did something

939
01:12:32,489 --> 01:12:33,520
premature,

940
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:37,027
something unauthorized.

941
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:41,898
But was blowing up
that train evil, wrong?

942
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:48,285
He was fighting evil
with all his heart.

943
01:12:53,033 --> 01:12:53,994
And Zoe?

944
01:12:57,773 --> 01:13:01,038
You have no idea
how special Zoe was to us.

945
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:04,728
Or is.

946
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,689
I gotta hand it to Vergis,

947
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,729
it's an elegant design.

948
01:13:27,164 --> 01:13:28,153
But will it work?

949
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,129
Well, I won't know

950
01:13:31,466 --> 01:13:33,438
until I put it into
a cybernetic body

951
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:36,453
and try and download
Zoe's avatar into it.

952
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:37,643
How long?

953
01:13:38,675 --> 01:13:40,664
Well, a couple of days, at least.

954
01:13:43,231 --> 01:13:45,252
I do have a surprise
for you, though.

955
01:13:47,704 --> 01:13:49,215
Your daughter's avatar is ready.

956
01:13:50,135 --> 01:13:52,636
- What?
- I used Zoe's original avatar program

957
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:54,888
to search and download
any data on Tamara Adams.

958
01:13:55,425 --> 01:13:58,075
School records,
medical DNA, you name it.

959
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,110
About 300 megabytes' worth.

960
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:03,188
You mean, she's in there?

961
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:04,809
The more I work with Zoe's code,

962
01:14:04,934 --> 01:14:07,951
the more I realize she was nothing short
of a computer genius.

963
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:09,481
I want to see her.

964
01:14:10,307 --> 01:14:11,363
Thought you might.

965
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:31,124
Baby?

966
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:36,929
- Baby?
- Daddy?

967
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:38,831
Tammy?

968
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:43,369
My Gods!

969
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:47,042
Daddy.

970
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:51,883
My Gods.

971
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,119
I'm so scared.

972
01:15:01,244 --> 01:15:03,247
What is this place?
What's going on?

973
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:04,957
It's okay.

974
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:06,584
I feel so strange.

975
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,913
- I know, but you're fine.
- It's not fine. It's not fine.

976
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:11,631
This is wrong.
This is so wrong.

977
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:14,970
I know, I know. But the important thing
is we're together.

978
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:18,388
- We can be a family again.
- I can't remember how I got here.

979
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:20,399
And I can't remember
where I was before now.

980
01:15:20,524 --> 01:15:22,434
It's confusing.
This is gonna take some time.

981
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:26,396
This isn't real. This doesn't feel real!
I don't feel real. I'm real...

982
01:15:26,521 --> 01:15:28,632
- It's not real.
- Willie misses you! I miss you!

983
01:15:28,757 --> 01:15:32,340
We can be a family together.
We can be a family again.

984
01:15:33,579 --> 01:15:35,279
- My heart isn't beating.
- I miss you.

985
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,432
Daddy, my heart isn't beating.

986
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,950
Daddy, why isn't my heart beating?

987
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:43,068
Why isn't my heart beating?
Why isn't it...

988
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:52,172
- My baby.
- I know.

989
01:15:52,341 --> 01:15:54,091
She couldn't feel her heart.

990
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,426
- She couldn't feel her heart beat.
- She'll adjust.

991
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:59,678
She's probably very confused
by everything. It's only natural.

992
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:02,140
No, it's not natural.

993
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:05,702
No, it's wrong.
It's an abomination.

994
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:07,061
Well, define "natural."

995
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:09,373
These glasses help me to see.

996
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:12,191
Artificial limbs and organs
help millions to live.

997
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:15,499
You'd hardly call those aids "natural."
I doubt you'd call them abominations.

998
01:16:15,624 --> 01:16:18,072
That's not what I mean
and you know it.

999
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:26,663
You mean, only the Gods
have power over death.

1000
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:32,396
I reject that notion.
I reject that notion!

1001
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:35,232
And I'm guessing
that you don't put too much stock

1002
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:36,549
in those ideas, either.

1003
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,012
We have a chance to have
our daughters back.

1004
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:42,938
And your wife.

1005
01:16:43,063 --> 01:16:45,725
Think of what that would mean
to your son, Joseph.

1006
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:50,494
How much would it mean to William
to be held by his mother again?

1007
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:54,207
You're not right.

1008
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:56,736
- You're out of your frakking mind.
- Maybe.

1009
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:01,616
Maybe. I've certainly
been accused of worse.

1010
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,551
Do you really think
this download is gonna work?

1011
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:23,336
This is what I do.

1012
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:27,351
This is what you do.

1013
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:29,236
What?

1014
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,472
There's a part of me that

1015
01:17:32,768 --> 01:17:34,023
doesn't want this to work.

1016
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:36,901
Why?

1017
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,756
I don't want to be on Caprica.

1018
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,272
But it's your home.

1019
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,920
It's not.

1020
01:17:46,565 --> 01:17:47,829
It's never been my home,

1021
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:51,457
and it stopped being a home
for the other Zoe a long time ago...

1022
01:17:51,587 --> 01:17:53,294
I don't know
what it's supposed to mean.

1023
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:56,420
Why do you think your daughter was on
a lev train instead of being in school?

1024
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:59,182
Do you think
she was just cutting school?

1025
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:00,569
Going shopping?

1026
01:18:01,255 --> 01:18:04,345
She was leaving Caprica,
and she wasn't coming back.

1027
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:07,348
You don't know what she was doing,
because you weren't there.

1028
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,359
I know where she was going.

1029
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,611
She told me she had a plan.

1030
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,797
She was going to Gemenon.

1031
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:16,176
And you know why?
Because she found God.

1032
01:18:16,301 --> 01:18:17,601
- The real God.
- Stop it!

1033
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:21,237
The children of Caprica are lost, Daddy.
We're all if we don't turn to the light.

1034
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:22,571
Listen to me, okay?

1035
01:18:22,986 --> 01:18:24,739
We'll talk about this later.

1036
01:18:25,076 --> 01:18:27,719
When are you going to realize
that later is too late?

1037
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,201
When did you ever listen,

1038
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,367
ever want to listen?

1039
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,521
You and Mom, you knew it all.

1040
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:40,464
Your arrogance was killing
your daughter.

1041
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:43,760
And that's how you lost her.

1042
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:46,411
Not to some bomb.

1043
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:53,598
Daddy. Daddy.

1044
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:55,849
Daddy. Daddy.

1045
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:29,304
Hi, Dad.

1046
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:38,395
We're gonna make a new beginning,
starting tonight.

1047
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,599
You and me.

1048
01:22:41,833 --> 01:22:43,030
You know what?

1049
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:45,873
Our family's gonna survive this.

1050
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,541
We're gonna get past this.

1051
01:22:49,931 --> 01:22:52,310
We're gonna put
our lives back together again.

1052
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:57,132
Mommy and Tamara are gone.

1053
01:22:59,159 --> 01:23:00,892
They're dead and
they're not coming back.

1054
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:04,020
So we have to honor them

1055
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:06,807
by continuing to live

1056
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:09,566
as best we can.

1057
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:15,421
I want you to know who you are.

1058
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,717
We come from a long,
proud line of Tauron peasants

1059
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:23,036
who knew how to work the land
and still stand proud.

1060
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:28,578
You're named after your grandfather.
Did I ever tell you that?

1061
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:31,934
William.

1062
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:35,468
He was killed
during the Tauron uprising.

1063
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:40,307
Our last name isn't Adams.

1064
01:23:42,401 --> 01:23:43,353
I changed it

1065
01:23:43,921 --> 01:23:45,847
after I arrived here on Caprica.

1066
01:23:46,919 --> 01:23:48,319
Our family name

1067
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:51,500
is Adama.

1068
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:55,156
Adama.

1069
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:59,322
And it's a good,
honorable Tauron name.

1070
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,632
Come here, Son.

1071
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:34,485
<i>Demonstration proceed,
in three, two, one.</i>

1072
01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:33,627
All targets neutralized.

1073
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:40,426
Program completed by your command.

1074
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:45,640
You've not only secured
a long-term contract

1075
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:47,650
but you've done a great service
to our planet.

1076
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:49,032
Thank you, Minister.

1077
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:52,822
The Vergis Corporation
have made certain accusations.

1078
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:54,657
If they really thought
they had a case,

1079
01:25:54,782 --> 01:25:56,644
they'd have us in court by now.

1080
01:25:57,406 --> 01:25:59,109
But no matter.
It was never our intention

1081
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,431
to take this contract
off-world, anyway.

1082
01:26:01,556 --> 01:26:04,467
It's been my experience
you can never trust a Tauron.

1083
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:05,910
Deceit is in their DNA.

1084
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:11,307
What'd you call it?

1085
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:13,684
Cybernetic life-form node.

1086
01:26:14,269 --> 01:26:15,702
A Cylon, Minister.

1087
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:19,042
Cylon.

1088
01:26:19,843 --> 01:26:20,925
Interesting.

1089
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:26,877
We did it, Doctor.

1090
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:28,390
Yes, we did.

1091
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:31,852
But it's not what I hoped for.

1092
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:00,073
Yeah. Hello?

1093
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:02,404
<i>Lacy?</i>

1094
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:07,208
Who is this?

1095
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:09,341
It's me.

1096
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:15,939
I'm here, and I think
I'm gonna need your help.
