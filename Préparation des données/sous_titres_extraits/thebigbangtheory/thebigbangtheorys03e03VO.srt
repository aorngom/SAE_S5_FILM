1
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:23,816
Good morning.
Come dance with me.

2
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,767
Why not?

3
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:33,487
While I subscribe
to the many worlds theory

4
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:37,758
which poses the existence of an infinite
number of Sheldons and universes,

5
00:00:37,883 --> 00:00:40,648
I assure you that none of them
am I dancing.

6
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:44,103
Are you fun in any of them?

7
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:48,764
The math would suggest
that in a few I'm a clown made of candy.

8
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:52,843
But I don't dance.

9
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,887
Want some French toast?

10
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,263
It's oatmeal day.

11
00:00:57,968 --> 00:01:00,726
Tell you what, next French toast day,
I'll make you oatmeal.

12
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:04,279
Dear Lord, are you still going
to be here on French toast day?

13
00:01:08,982 --> 00:01:10,092
Morning.

14
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:12,780
Penny made French toast.

15
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:15,182
Sorry I haven't given her
your schedule yet.

16
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,785
It's an iCal download.

17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,535
She can put it right in her phone.

18
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:22,873
And I thought we agreed that you'd have
your conjugal visits in her apartment.

19
00:01:23,529 --> 00:01:26,179
We did, but there were
extenuating circumstances.

20
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:27,092
I see.

21
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:30,089
Did her abysmal housekeeping skills
finally trump her perkiness?

22
00:01:32,413 --> 00:01:34,636
No, her bed kind of... broke.

23
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:38,681
That doesn't seem likely.

24
00:01:38,923 --> 00:01:40,723
Her bed's of sturdy construction.

25
00:01:41,778 --> 00:01:45,218
Even the addition of a 2nd normal size
human being wouldn't cause a failure.

26
00:01:45,343 --> 00:01:47,231
Much less a homunculus
such as yourself.

27
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:50,401
A homunculus?

28
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,764
Perfectly formed
miniature human being.

29
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:57,938
You're my little homunculus.

30
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:00,903
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

31
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:02,872
Who wants syrup
and who wants cinnamon sugar?

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,266
I want oatmeal.

33
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,166
I want a boyfriend whose roommate
isn't a giant pain in the ass.

34
00:02:08,888 --> 00:02:10,504
I'm sure
that will happen soon enough.

35
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:14,560
But in the meantime,
I still want oatmeal.

36
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:17,579
You know what, I give up.
He's impossible.

37
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,104
I can't be impossible. I exist.

38
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:24,157
I believe what you meant to say is,
"I give up, he's improbable."

39
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,966
You really need to find a better way
of dealing with Penny.

40
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:37,216
What am I supposed to do...
eat French toast on a Monday?

41
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:38,976
Now, that would be impossible.

42
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:43,162
I'm just saying, you can catch
more flies with honey than with vinegar.

43
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:46,624
You can catch more flies with manure.
What's your point?

44
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:48,622
It's a...

45
00:02:52,987 --> 00:02:54,667
Boy, that does smell good.

46
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,217
Too bad it's Monday.

47
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,349
Episode 303: The Gothowitz Deviation

48
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,899
Sync: Jess, Linwelin, Loky

49
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,779
www.subbercafe.fr

50
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,199
So Kim the night manager
went on maternity leave,

51
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:30,918
And her husband's name is Sandy.

52
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,169
So get this...

53
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,679
Her replacement
is a woman named Sandy

54
00:03:34,804 --> 00:03:36,537
whose husband's name is Kim.

55
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,263
I know.

56
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:44,056
What are the odds?

57
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:45,388
Easily calculable.

58
00:03:45,513 --> 00:03:47,763
We begin by identifying
a set of married couples

59
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:48,921
with unisex names.

60
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:51,126
We eliminate those unqualified
for restaurant work...

61
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:53,789
The aged, the imprisoned
and the limbless, for example.

62
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:55,489
Next we look at the...

63
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:58,904
It's an amazing coincidence.
Can we leave it at that?

64
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:01,761
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,886
It's as if the Cheesecake Factory
is run by witches.

66
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:13,060
It's as if
you don't think I'll punch you.

67
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,047
Come on, you guys, let it go.

68
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,261
Fine, whatever.

69
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:20,562
Are you finished?

70
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:22,387
Thank you.

71
00:04:22,572 --> 00:04:23,762
How thoughtful.

72
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,098
Would you like a chocolate?

73
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,325
Yeah, sure.

74
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,392
Thanks.

75
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,512
What was that?

76
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,950
You said be nice to Penny.

77
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:43,502
I believe offering chocolate to someone
falls within the definition of nice.

78
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:47,715
It does.
But in my experience, you don't.

79
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:51,885
There are more things in heaven
and earth, Horatio,

80
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,667
Than are dreamt of
in your philosophy

81
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:55,451
Now that's you.

82
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:57,155
Obnoxious and insufferable.

83
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,012
What's going on, day dwellers?

84
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:10,894
Oh, man, did the Kiss Army
repeal "don't ask, don't tell"?

85
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:16,398
Raj and I are going
to a goth club in Hollywood

86
00:05:16,523 --> 00:05:18,158
to hang with the night people.

87
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:23,387
- Anybody want to come along?
- You're actually going out like that?

88
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,529
I'm going out like this...

89
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,955
What did you do?

90
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:33,582
They're called tattoo sleeves.
Look.

91
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:36,877
I got them online.
Raj got a set, too...

92
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:42,150
Fantastic, right?

93
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,239
Put them on, have hot sex with some
freaky girl with her business pierced,

94
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:48,263
take them off, and I can still be buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

95
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,893
You know, I've always wanted
to go to a goth nightclub.

96
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:54,590
- Really?
- Bazinga!

97
00:05:57,272 --> 00:06:00,037
None of you ever see
my practical jokes coming, do you?

98
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:04,411
Okay, how about you two?
Look, I've got some extra tat sleeves.

99
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:07,323
Why are you carrying extras?

100
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:09,890
In case I snag one on
someone's nipple ring.

101
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:12,913
I think we'll pass.

102
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:17,297
Is the missus speaking
for the couple now?

103
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,299
In this case, you bet she is.

104
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:25,698
Yes, she's pushy,
and yes, he's whipped,

105
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:27,573
but that's not the expression.

106
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:35,062
Come on, I want to stop at Walgreen's
and pick up some more eyeliner.

107
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:42,735
They're gonna get beaten up
at that club.

108
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,640
They're gonna get beaten up
at Walgreen's.

109
00:06:49,857 --> 00:06:51,910
Sorry, Sheldon.
I almost sat in your spot.

110
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,686
Did you? I didn't notice.

111
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,235
Have a chocolate.

112
00:06:58,427 --> 00:06:59,488
Thank you.

113
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:14,558
I think we're fitting in
quite nicely.

114
00:07:16,865 --> 00:07:19,563
It'd help if you weren't
drinking light beer.

115
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:22,775
What's so gothic
about vodka and cranberry juice?

116
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:25,401
Hello? It looks like blood.

117
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:28,888
Did you even read the "wiki how" link
I sent you on being goth?

118
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:31,616
No, I'm behind on my wiki-reading.

119
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:34,454
I'm kind of on a John Grisham
kick right now.

120
00:07:34,964 --> 00:07:35,746
What?

121
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,127
I finished reading <i>The Pelican Brief</i>
and loved it so much,

122
00:07:38,252 --> 00:07:40,054
I dived right into <i>The Client.</i>

123
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:43,904
He was a lawyer himself, so his novels
are accurate as well as entertaining.

124
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,404
Just remember we are lost boys,

125
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:50,260
children of the night.

126
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,980
Great. Lost boys.
Children of the night. Got it.

127
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:57,257
Can you pass the chex mix please?

128
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,291
Thank you.

129
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:05,407
We are lost boys.

130
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:09,530
Good for you.

131
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,663
I'm actually much more lost
than he is.

132
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:15,869
Nice ink.

133
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:19,498
Thanks.
Can we buy you ladies a drink?

134
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:21,959
Two light beers.

135
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:25,113
Light beers.
Well, wiki-how about that?

136
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:28,757
- What's your names?
- I'm Howard.

137
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:30,313
- Raj.
- I'm Bethany.

138
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:32,928
- Nice to meet you, Bethany.
- Yes, very nice.

139
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,565
Nice to meet you, too.

140
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:36,070
I'm Sarah.

141
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:37,853
Not that anyone cares.

142
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:45,190
Do either of you ladies enjoy
the novels of John Grisham?

143
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:56,702
What's this cartoon called again?

144
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,918
<i>Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.</i>

145
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:02,070
It's not a cartoon.

146
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:03,414
It's anime.

147
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:05,838
Anime.

148
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:08,422
I knew a girl in high school
named Anna May.

149
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:11,097
Anna May Fletcher.

150
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:14,693
She was born with one nostril.

151
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:18,567
Then she had this bad nose job
and basically wound up with three.

152
00:09:24,385 --> 00:09:25,880
You're here a lot now.

153
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,559
Am I talking too much?
I'm sorry. Zip.

154
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:31,778
Thank you.

155
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,572
Chocolate?

156
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:35,605
Yes, please.

157
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:43,874
Hey, Kim.

158
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:49,004
You know what, hold on.
Let me take this in the hall.

159
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:59,311
You'll never guess
who they got to replace you at work.

160
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:06,772
- I know what you're doing.
- Really?

161
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:09,982
Yes, you're using chocolates
as positive reinforcement

162
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:12,569
for what you consider
correct behavior.

163
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:16,747
Very good.

164
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,931
- Chocolate?
- No, I don't want any chocolate!

165
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:29,179
You can't train my girlfriend
like a lab rat.

166
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:32,423
Actually, it turns out I can.

167
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:35,759
Well, you shouldn't.

168
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:37,928
There's just no pleasing you,
is there?

169
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,137
You weren't happy

170
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,887
with my previous approach,

171
00:10:41,012 --> 00:10:43,892
so I decided to employ operant
conditioning techniques,

172
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,103
building on the works
of Thorndike and Skinner.

173
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,688
By this time next week,

174
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:49,851
I believe I can have her
jumping out of a pool,

175
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:52,104
balancing a beach ball on her nose.

176
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:56,280
No, this has to stop now.

177
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:59,937
I'm not suggesting we really
make her jump out of a pool.

178
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,411
I thought the "bazinga" was implied.

179
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:05,640
We're just tweaking her personality.

180
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,790
Sanding off the rough edges,
if you will.

181
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,001
No. You're not sanding Penny.

182
00:11:10,824 --> 00:11:13,638
Are you saying that I am forbidden

183
00:11:13,763 --> 00:11:16,496
from applying a harmless,
scientifically valid protocol

184
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:18,175
that will make our lives better?

185
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:21,138
Yes. You're forbidden.

186
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:25,984
Bad Leonard.

187
00:11:34,773 --> 00:11:35,985
So, what do you guys do?

188
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,201
You know, goth stuff.

189
00:11:38,326 --> 00:11:40,194
Goth magazines, goth music.

190
00:11:40,508 --> 00:11:41,627
Goth food.

191
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,035
What's goth food?

192
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:48,126
Blackened salmon?

193
00:11:49,766 --> 00:11:52,335
No, I meant what do you do for jobs?

194
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:54,087
We're scientists.

195
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,465
Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.

196
00:11:56,797 --> 00:11:58,383
What are the dark sciences?

197
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:01,828
Well, I am an astrophysicist,

198
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:04,181
and a lot of that
takes place at night.

199
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,515
When there are vampires

200
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,288
and miscellaneous
undead out and about.

201
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:12,598
<i>Oy vay.</i>

202
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:15,859
That sounds really cool.

203
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:19,610
Does it? Okay.
If you like space stuff,

204
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:22,106
I design components
for the International Space Station,

205
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:23,247
which is in space.

206
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:25,863
Where, as I'm sure you know,
no one can hear you scream.

207
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:32,292
- So, what do you gals do?
- I work at the Gap.

208
00:12:32,647 --> 00:12:35,379
Really? How about that?
I've been to the Gap.

209
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:38,681
I've been there, as well. I like
your t-shirts with the little pocket.

210
00:12:39,987 --> 00:12:41,456
I work there, too.

211
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:43,017
Not that anyone cares.

212
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:47,933
You know, this place is boring.

213
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:52,062
Why don't we go somewhere else
and have some fun?

214
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,648
- Okay.
- Sure, we like fun.

215
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,685
- We are fun people.
- Dark and fun.

216
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:01,178
Come on.
I know a place you'll really dig.

217
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,582
- Did you bring the black condoms?
- In my fanny pack.

218
00:13:06,707 --> 00:13:07,707
Let's go.

219
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:16,672
Are you happy now?

220
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:20,531
Not particularly.

221
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:26,511
Oh, my God, she didn't!

222
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:31,184
What could she possibly
be talking about for so long?

223
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:34,207
Obviously, waitressing
at the Cheesecake Factory

224
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:36,884
is a complex socioeconomic activity

225
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:40,160
that requires a great deal
of analysis and planning.

226
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:44,133
Bazinga.

227
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,020
You know, using positive
reinforcement techniques,

228
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:51,764
I could train that behavior
out of her in a week.

229
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:56,745
Let me use negative reinforcement,
I can get it done before we go to bed.

230
00:13:57,446 --> 00:14:00,396
You're not squirting her
in the face with water.

231
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,040
Of course not.

232
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,967
We're talking
very mild electric shocks.

233
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,108
No tissue damage whatsoever.

234
00:14:08,203 --> 00:14:10,206
- Forget it.
- Oh, come on.

235
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:11,391
You can't tell me

236
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,833
that you're not intrigued
about the possibility

237
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,729
of building a better girlfriend.

238
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:16,898
I'm not.

239
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,335
Penny's qualities,
both good and bad,

240
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,310
are what make her who she is.

241
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:27,908
You mean, like that high-pitched,
irritating laugh?

242
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,820
You wouldn't prefer
a throaty chuckle?

243
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,939
You're not changing
how Penny laughs.

244
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:38,126
That would be incongruous.

245
00:14:38,386 --> 00:14:41,004
I was going to lower the whole voice
to a more pleasing register.

246
00:14:42,922 --> 00:14:44,022
Sorry, guys.

247
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:46,160
That girl is freaky.

248
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,678
Come again?

249
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:50,222
Freaky.

250
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:52,548
- Freaky?
- Yeah, freaky.

251
00:15:01,418 --> 00:15:02,768
Have a chocolate.

252
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:15,393
Are you going to deface your body

253
00:15:15,518 --> 00:15:17,645
just for the possibility
you could have cheap sex

254
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,417
with a strange girl
you met in a bar?

255
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:24,673
What is your mother going to say?

256
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,767
She's not going to see it.

257
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:29,254
She takes my temperature orally now.

258
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,997
What are you going to get?

259
00:15:34,122 --> 00:15:35,647
I can't really decide

260
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:38,456
between a screaming devil,
this mean little skull,

261
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:40,031
or Kermit the frog.

262
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:42,971
- Kermit the frog?
- You know.

263
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:45,006
<i>Hi-ho. I'm on Howard's butt.</i>

264
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,815
Get the mean little skull,

265
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,615
and I'll see
if I can make him smile.

266
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,283
I'd like the mean
little skull, please.

267
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:56,082
What are you going to get, Raj?

268
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:58,035
With my luck, hepatitis.

269
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:01,539
Okay, here we go.

270
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,136
That's just rubbing alcohol.

271
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:07,524
I know, but it was cold.

272
00:16:09,753 --> 00:16:11,261
I'm putting on the stencil.

273
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,929
- What comes after the stencil?
- This.

274
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,522
No needle. No pain.
No tattoo.

275
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,903
What's the big deal?
You've done this before.

276
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:26,990
No, I haven't. Look.

277
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,574
I'm sorry. I'm a fraud.
He's a fraud.

278
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,950
- We're both frauds.
- I think I covered that.

279
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,668
But I was summing up.

280
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:40,326
We're not goth.
We're just...

281
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:42,139
Guys.

282
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:43,864
Very, very smart guys.

283
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:45,837
So you were totally scamming us?

284
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:50,091
And I wouldn't blame you

285
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,193
if you walked out of here
and never wanted to see us again.

286
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:57,319
Unless, of course, our bold honesty
has suddenly made us attractive.

287
00:16:57,444 --> 00:16:58,894
Huh? Huh? Anything?

288
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,960
I'm leaving.

289
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:08,801
I'm leaving, too.

290
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,762
Not that anyone cares.

291
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:21,373
When we tell this story,
let's end it differently.

292
00:17:22,446 --> 00:17:25,688
What are you thinking?
Maybe a big musical number?

293
00:17:30,137 --> 00:17:33,485
Well, I'm going to make
some warm milk and then turn in.

294
00:17:34,324 --> 00:17:37,699
I trust if you two are planning
on engaging in amorous activities,

295
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,683
you'll keep the decibel level
to a minimum.

296
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:41,479
Of course.

297
00:17:41,889 --> 00:17:42,889
Thank you.

298
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:47,349
These are so good.

299
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:50,442
Unbelievable.

300
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:53,575
What?

301
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,741
I was just thinking
we should probably turn in, too.

302
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:58,785
My new bed got delivered.

303
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,079
If you put it together,
you can stay at my place.

304
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:03,456
That's a lot of work,
and it's kind of late.

305
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,542
But if we stay there,
we won't have to be quiet.

306
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:06,819
Let's go.

307
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,256
Interesting.

308
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:15,930
Sex works even better than chocolate
to modify behavior.

309
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:21,817
I wonder if anyone else
has stumbled onto that.

310
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:30,525
Okay, wait.
How about this?

311
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,959
We say there were four goth girls.

312
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:35,372
The two girls in the club
had two friends.

313
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,941
I like it, I like it.

314
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,160
Did they smell good despite
their goth-like nature?

315
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:42,120
What's the matter?

316
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,831
Engaging my olfactory sense
helps make it real for me.

317
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:46,834
Fine, they smelled good.

318
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,543
They did.
Like jasmine and honeysuckle.

319
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,463
Then they held hands and did
a sexy, demonic hokey pokey for us.

320
00:18:57,165 --> 00:19:00,181
Let me say my story then you say yours,
then we'll pick.

321
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,306
Sorry. Go on.

322
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:02,761
We got tattoos,

323
00:19:02,886 --> 00:19:05,185
and then the four girls
took us to their place.

324
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,771
But we don't have tattoos.
What if someone asks to see them?

325
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:10,872
We say
they're in a very intimate area.

326
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,760
We're bad boys, aren't we?

327
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,909
So, we go back to their place
and the six of us end up in a hot tub.

328
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,266
But we just got tattoos.

329
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:25,288
Wouldn't we be concerned
about bacterial infection?

330
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,399
True. Okay.
Forget the hot tub.

331
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:32,626
The point is, we each had
a <i>ménage</i> with sexy goth girls.

332
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:37,836
What a great night.

333
00:19:46,577 --> 00:19:48,478
Want to try a country bar
tomorrow night?

334
00:19:48,964 --> 00:19:51,064
Maybe we'll get lucky
with some sexy cowgirls.

335
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:53,059
Could happen.

336
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:57,362
I wonder how they smell.
