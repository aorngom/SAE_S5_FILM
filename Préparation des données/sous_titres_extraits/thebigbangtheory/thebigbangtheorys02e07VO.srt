1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,330
Time!

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,400
All right, Klingons, pencils down.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,460
Okay, I have "pokh."

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,130
Have it. Got it.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,130
"Potl."

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,400
Yup. Have it. Have it.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,400
"Pukhpa."

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,730
Have it. Got it. Yup.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,730
I have "chorrr."

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,630
Got it. Yup.

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,830
-"Nekhmakh." -Yeah. Yeah.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,260
And "kreplach."

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,660
Hold on a second. "Kreplach?"

14
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,490
Yeah.

15
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,880
That isn't Klingon; it's Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,930
Well, as it turns out, it's also a Klingon word.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,360
Really? Define it.

18
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,100
"Kreplach": A hearty Klingon... dumpling.

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,460
Judge's ruling?

20
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,330
Bilurrrbe.

21
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,130
Hey, guys, I need to use your TV.

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,300
What's wrong with your TV?

23
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,460
I don't know. It just died.

24
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm getting a bunch of static.

25
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,960
Did you pay your cable bill?

26
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,460
Ugh, you sound just like the cable company.

27
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,460
All right, so, shh!

28
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,630
Tyra Banks is about to kick

29
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,230
someone off  America's Next Top Model.

30
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,960
Excuse me, Penny, but we're...

31
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,960
No, no, don't tell her.

32
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,030
playing Klingon Boggle.

33
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,760
Aw...

34
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,130
What do you mean, "Aw"?

35
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,260
Like she didn't know we were nerds?

36
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,530
All right, if you must watch,

37
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,060
then mute it with closed captions, please.

38
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,400
Fine.

39
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,460
All right, Boggle warriors... kapla'!

40
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Look at those women.

41
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,130
They're gorgeous.

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,200
Oh! "Worf," nice! Too bad that's a proper noun.

43
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,800
Oh, look, the's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

44
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,800
No, wait, that's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

45
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,200
With her head in the lap of...

46
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,060
Oh, what a coincidence. It's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.

47
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,930
Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother.

48
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,560
The current Mrs. Wolowitz.

49
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,700
Is "qochbe'" spelled with a (gargling) or a (guttural grunt)?

50
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,360
Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?

51
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,530
That's Anais.

52
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,800
None of the other girls in the house like her.

53
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,760
House? What house?

54
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,460
They all live in a house together.

55
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,130
A house, where?

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,260
I don't know. Somewhere in L.A.

57
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,430
Wait a minute.

58
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,300
You're telling me that I'm within driving distance

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,260
of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?

60
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,960
Yeah, I guess.

61
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,730
And they live together and shower together and...

62
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,300
have naked pillow fights?

63
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,000
Hey, wh-where are you going?

64
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,960
To pay my cable bill.

65
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,260
All right, pencils down!

66
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,600
I have "lokh," "makh," and "cherrrkh."

67
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,530
Anybody got those?

68
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,530
Did I miss anything?

69
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,760
Did they kick Giselle off?

70
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,060
Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot

71
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,700
was an embarrassment.

72
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:41,160
Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine.

73
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,100
Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed.

74
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,700
Sheldon, the food's here.

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,900
Ooh, there's the house.

76
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,300
Freeze frame, freeze frame.

77
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,960
What are you doing?

78
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,200
Marking the star positions and physical landmarks

79
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,800
so we can find the house of the supermodels.

80
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,960
Why?

81
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,630
Isn't it obvious?

82
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,760
Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl,

83
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,900
making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem.

84
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,630
A.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.

85
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,230
-Is my hamburger medium well? -Yes.

86
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,030
-Dill slices, not sweet? -Yes.

87
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,160
-Individual relish packets? -Yes.

88
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,660
-Onion rings? -Yes.

89
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,830
-Extra breading? -I asked.

90
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,760
-What did they say? -No. -Did you protest?

91
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,330
-Yes. -Vociferously? -No.

92
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,630
Well, then what took you so long?

93
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,960
Just eat.

94
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,700
Hey, guys, what'd I miss? What'd I miss?

95
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,000
Giselle's hanging by a thread.

96
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,260
Oh, good, I hate her.

97
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,000
Then you're not invited to our wedding.

98
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,000
Here you go.

99
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,160
Thank you.

100
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,730
Oh, do we have to suffer through this

101
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,430
transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?

102
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,660
Yes.

103
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,930
You and I have a standing TV schedule,

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,530
which is the result of extensive debate and compromise.

105
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,930
Any alterations except for breaking news

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,360
have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.

107
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,800
Put it on the agenda.

108
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,560
But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.

109
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,400
Oh, I'll make a motion, but you're not going to like it.

110
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,360
Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure.

111
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,460
At least put it on mute.

112
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,700
Oh, Giselle's not getting kicked off.

113
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,260
It's totally going to be Summer.

114
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,960
What?

115
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,930
Sheldon's onion ring. Just put it back!

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,630
It's one onion ring.

117
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,900
Just put it back before he comes!

118
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,430
No, no, no!

119
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,200
No, I don't think that's where it was.

120
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,260
Okay, here he comes.  Deny, deny, people.

121
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,360
Wall of silence.

122
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,730
Who touched my...

123
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,100
Penny! Penny did it.

124
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,560
Why would you do that?

125
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,630
I don't know. I was hungry?

126
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,000
What's the big deal?

127
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,560
The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.

128
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,430
All right. Look, I didn't know, I'm sorry.

129
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,930
Well, I'm sorry, but that is your second strike.

130
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,600
What?

131
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,030
You have two strikes.

132
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,830
Three strikes and you're out.

133
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,560
It's a sports metaphor.

134
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,430
A sports metaphor?

135
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,330
Yes, baseball.

136
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,260
All right, yeah. I-I'll play along.

137
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,400
What was my first strike?

138
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,700
March 18th.

139
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,360
You violated my rule about forwarding email humor.

140
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,860
I did?

141
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,100
The photo of the cat who wants to "has cheezeburger"?

142
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,060
Oh, come on. Everybody loves "LOL cats."

143
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:36,560
They're cute and they can't spell 'cause they're cats.

144
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,630
I trusted you with my email address,

145
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,360
and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality:

146
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,700
strike one.

147
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,430
Touching my food: strike two.

148
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,560
Don't worry. They only stay on your record for a year.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,300
You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class.

150
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,260
Come on, I touched one onion ring.

151
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,660
Yeah, and then you put it back,

152
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,630
compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings.

153
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,900
Oh, honey, the buses don't go where you live, do they?

154
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,830
Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you,

155
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,860
but since you've become a permanent member of our social group,

156
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,200
I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else.

157
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,030
Congratulations. You're officially one of us.

158
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,660
One of us, one of us.

159
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,330
Well, what a thrill.

160
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,500
You're sitting in my spot.

161
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,630
Oh, jeez, you've got to be kidding me.

162
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,760
Leonard, she's in my spot.

163
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,930
Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here's the thing.

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,930
After you leave, I still have to live with him.

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,030
I don't care. I'm taking a stand.

166
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,830
Metaphorically.

167
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,000
All right, that's it. Strike three.

168
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,060
Ooh, strike three.

169
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,960
I'm banished?

170
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,460
What the hell kind of crap is that?

171
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,200
Listen, don't worry. I'll talk to him.

172
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,560
Yeah, you do that.

173
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,560
Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class?

174
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,160
You can do it online!

175
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,460
So based on our triangulation,

176
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,530
we've narrowed down the location of the Top Model house

177
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,230
to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.

178
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,400
Or possibly Durham, Noh Carolina.

179
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,360
When we find it, you want to go with us?

180
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,330
To do what?

181
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,160
Party with the pretty girls, dude!

182
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,600
Are you insane?

183
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,260
You're not going to party with them.

184
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,060
You're not even going to get anywhere near that place.

185
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,260
That's what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.

186
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,260
No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong.

187
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,260
The entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure

188
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,730
to put a man on the moon.

189
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,230
Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out,

190
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,260
we will put a Wolowitz on one of America's top models.

191
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,760
And a large number of people will believe it never happened.

192
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,600
Okay, let me guess.

193
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,600
A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.

194
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,000
Thank you.

195
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,600
Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds

196
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,360
for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard.

197
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,730
And for our suddenly "back on the Hindu wagon" Raj,

198
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,400
the meatlover's pizza, no meat.

199
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,930
Coming right up.

200
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,130
Wait. Excuse me.

201
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,560
You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger,

202
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,030
barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.

203
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,230
Oh, I didn't tell you?

204
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,930
You're banished from the Cheesecake Factory.

205
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,330
Why?

206
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,560
Well, you have three strikes.

207
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,400
One: coming in. Two: sitting down.

208
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,000
And three: I don't like your attitude.

209
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,560
You can't do that.

210
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,860
Not only is it a violation of California state law,

211
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,900
it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.

212
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,530
Yeah, no, there's a new policy:

213
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,830
No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.

214
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,330
I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.

215
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,330
Penny, can I talk to you for a minute?

216
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,900
Well, here's the thing.

217
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,500
Um, I talked to Sheldon

218
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,760
and he feels terrible

219
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,600
and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.

220
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,200
Really? Well, that's great.

221
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,260
Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?

222
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,100
What? I'm not going to apologize to that nutcase.

223
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,400
Oh, come on. It's easy.

224
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,630
He'll even tell you what to say.

225
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,800
Leard, don't you get it?

226
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,700
If you guys keep going along with his insanity,

227
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,500
you're just encouraging him.

228
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,660
We're not encouraging.

229
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,730
It's more like... knuckling under.

230
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,400
Look, I like hanging out with you guys,

231
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,760
but I'm not going to apologize for something I didn't do.

232
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,130
Well, actually, technically, you did do it.

233
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
That's strike one, Leonard.

234
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,230
There you go: quesadilla.

235
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,800
Salad.

236
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,400
There's your pizza.

237
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,360
And thanks to Sheldon's heated discussion

238
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,430
with my manager

239
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,030
one barbecue bacon cheeseburger,

240
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,760
barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.

241
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,160
Thank you.

242
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,800
Go ahead. Eat it.

243
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,910
I dare you

244
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,000
That's it. There's the house.

245
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,160
I foundAmerica's top models!

246
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,200
Are you sure?

247
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,360
Look, on the roof.

248
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,930
Anais and Giselle are sunbathing.

249
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,300
European-style.

250
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
You can recognize people on Google Earth?

251
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,100
Of course not.

252
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,100
I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.

253
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,700
NORAD? You're using military aircraft?

254
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,760
It was already targeted to poke around

255
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,860
a nuclear reactor in Siberia.

256
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,100
I took it an hour out of its way, tops.

257
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,100
Okay, where is he?

258
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,660
Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?

259
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,930
Here. Try and go online.

260
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,630
Problem with the WiFi? Just try.

261
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,660
Greetings, hamburger toucher.

262
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,730
You are probably wondering

263
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,230
why you cannot IM with your little friends

264
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,000
about how much you "heart" various things.

265
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,760
This recorded message is alerting you

266
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,300
that I am putting an end

267
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,700
to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi.

268
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,960
If you want to remedy the situation,

269
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,030
you can contact the phone company,

270
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,600
set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me.

271
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:25,930
Well?

272
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,200
I reiterate: knuckle under.

273
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,260
No, no, no, no, no. It is on.

274
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,060
I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.

275
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,130
Oh, Penny, you don't want to get into it

276
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,130
with Sheldon.

277
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,730
The guy is one lab accident away

278
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,860
from being a supervillain.

279
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,500
I don't care. I was in junior rodeo.

280
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,560
I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.

281
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,960
No need to neuter the nerd.

282
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,600
I can get you back online.

283
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,060
There, see? Problem solved.

284
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,200
Voil?

285
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,100
SHELDON: Hello, puny insects.

286
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,460
As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will,

287
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,400
everyone is awarded one additional strike.

288
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,400
Thanks a lot, Howard.

289
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,860
What are you complaining about?

290
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,330
I'm the one who has to take the class again.

291
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,000
Hello.

292
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,130
Time to do your laundry, huh?

293
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,130
It's Saturday night.

294
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,100
Saturday is laundry night.

295
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,930
I know.

296
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,700
Every Saturday at 8:15.

297
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,000
Easy to anticipate.

298
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,230
What are you implying?

299
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,230
I'm implying that you're a creature of habit.

300
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,030
And if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry

301
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,600
on Saturday at 8:15,

302
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,960
you might find it...

303
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,360
unpleasant.

304
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,800
Knuckle under? My ass.

305
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,660
Oh, no, are all the machines taken?

306
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,560
What are you gonna do?

307
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,700
No problem.

308
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,400
I'll just do my laundry another night.

309
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,530
Another night?

310
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,630
Well, I guess you can try,

311
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,360
but deep inside your heart,

312
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,530
you'll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.

313
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,600
Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.

314
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,860
Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.

315
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,130
Sheldon. Sheldon!

316
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,800
Sheldon.

317
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,560
Yes?

318
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,160
Where are my clothes?

319
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,060
Your clothes? Yes, I left them in the washers

320
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,660
and when I went down to get them, they were gone.

321
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,230
Really?

322
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,730
Despite the sign that says "Do not leave laundry unattended"?

323
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,700
Sheldon, where are my clothes?

324
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,000
You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments.

325
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,360
Where was that?

326
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,960
Oh, yes...

327
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,900
Earlier this evening,

328
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,900
I happened to gaze out the window

329
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,530
and a brassiere caught my eye.

330
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,200
Do those look familiar?

331
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,460
How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?

332
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,030
When you understand the laws of physics, Penny,

333
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,800
anything is possible.

334
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,360
And may I add: mwuh-ha-ha.

335
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,130
Get them down.

336
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,400
Apologize. Never.

337
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,500
Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick

338
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,930
and play panty pinata.

339
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,600
Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay?

340
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,960
I've done some stupid things.

341
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,260
You've done some stupid things.

342
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,900
How about we just call it even and move on with our lives?

343
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,560
I've done no stupid things.

344
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,330
Look, you've got to meet me halfway here.

345
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,900
I am meeting you halfway.

346
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,100
I'm willing to concede that you've done stupid things.

347
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,700
Hey, you guys are talking again. Good.

348
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,960
What happened?

349
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,600
Leonard, remember when I said it was on?

350
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,760
Well, now it's junior rodeo on.

351
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh, not junior rodeo.

352
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,530
What did you do?

353
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,300
I had no choice, Leonard.

354
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,300
She ruined laundry night.

355
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,030
Mwuh-ha-ha.

356
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,960
Telephone wires can't electrocute you, can they?

357
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,730
No. Look, this has to stop.

358
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.

359
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,600
All right, I really didn't want to do this, but...

360
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,300
here.

361
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,130
What's this?

362
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,330
Sheldon's Kryptonite.

363
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,300
Oh, my God.

364
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,500
He can never know that I gave that to you.

365
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,600
Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but...

366
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,960
but this?

367
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,130
It'll shorten the war by five years

368
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,460
and save millions of lives.

369
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,160
Oh, pause it. That's it. Confirmed.

370
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,460
We now have the address of the Top Model house.

371
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,000
God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark.

372
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,000
Okay, for the record,

373
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,900
what you're doing is really creepy.

374
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,560
You know what? If it's "creepy"

375
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,460
to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft

376
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,760
to find a house full of gorgeous young models

377
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,800
so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly,

378
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,900
then fine, I'm "creepy."

379
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,260
Hello.

380
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,500
Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I'll get him.

381
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,600
Sheldon, it's for you.

382
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,460
Who is it? Your mother.

383
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,600
Oh, good.

384
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,960
Hi, Mom. How are you?

385
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,760
But, Mom...

386
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,230
she keeps sitting in my spot.

387
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,160
And-and she touched my food.

388
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,160
Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it...

389
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,760
No, that's not fair.

390
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,330
Why should I have to apologize?

391
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,760
Yeah, I really don't think this is the kind of thing

392
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,800
Jesus concerns himself with.

393
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,230
No, you're right.

394
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,760
I don't really know what Jesus thinks about.

395
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,460
All right, good-bye.

396
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,030
Did you tell on me?

397
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,500
Are you kidding me?

398
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,060
I already have two strikes.

399
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,460
Penny. Penny.

400
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,260
Penny.

401
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,330
I am very, very sorry for what I have done.

402
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,560
Here's your laundry.

403
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,300
I rescind your strikes

404
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,230
and you are no longer banished.

405
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,660
Can I sit wherever I want?

406
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,830
Never mind, never mind.

407
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,500
That's, that's not important.

408
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,430
Sheldon, this was big of you.

409
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,060
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

410
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,300
Thank you.

411
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,800
Good night, Sheldon.

412
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,260
Penny...

413
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,500
Yes?

414
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,460
Well played.

415
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,860
Thank you.

416
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:49,260
Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility.

417
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Understood.

418
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,680
Can I help you

419
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,150
Yes, we here to fix the cable.

420
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,990
I think we have satellite.

421
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,870
That's what I meant.

422
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,960
Oh. Okay, come on in.

423
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,880
She's taller than all the women in my family combined.

424
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,650
What do we do now?

425
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,210
Follow Mrs. Wolowitz.
