1
00:00:00,655 --> 00:00:02,473
Okay, Raj.

2
00:00:03,063 --> 00:00:05,463
Hand me the #6 Torx screwdriver.

3
00:00:07,146 --> 00:00:08,247
Stop.

4
00:00:09,414 --> 00:00:11,135
We can't do this.
It's not right.

5
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:14,893
You have two choices. Either you let him
put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo,

6
00:00:15,018 --> 00:00:17,027
or you delete stuff
before we go out of town.

7
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,727
But once you open the box,
you've voided the warranty.

8
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:21,479
The warranty

9
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:24,357
is a sacred covenant we've entered into
with the manufacturer.

10
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:26,312
He offers to stand by his equipment,

11
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:30,028
and we in return agree not to violate
the integrity of the internal hardware.

12
00:00:30,153 --> 00:00:31,606
This little orange sticker

13
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,752
is all that stands
between us and anarchy.

14
00:00:36,612 --> 00:00:38,388
Then we won't touch the hard drive.

15
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:41,192
We'll just erase the first
season of <i>Battlestar</i>.

16
00:00:43,356 --> 00:00:44,877
There. We're outlaws.

17
00:00:46,888 --> 00:00:48,422
Is this going to be big enough?

18
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:49,686
It's perfect.

19
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:55,393
For taking daffodils
to your unicorn.

20
00:00:57,407 --> 00:00:59,463
It's just for my notebooks.
Thanks, Penny.

21
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:02,103
I love San Francisco.
I wish I was going with you.

22
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:05,780
I understand your envy.
This is a can't-miss symposium.

23
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:09,704
There are going to be discussions
on bioorganic cellular computer devices,

24
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:12,264
the advancements
in multi-threaded task completion,

25
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,952
plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium
Green's function approach

26
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:18,285
to the photoionization process
in atoms.

27
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:22,637
When I go, I usually just get hammered
and ride the cable cars.

28
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,084
This conference is
kind of a big thing.

29
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,628
The keynote address
is being delivered by George Smoot.

30
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,964
Oh, my God, the <i>George Smoot</i>?

31
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:32,820
- You've heard of him?
- Of course I haven't.

32
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,978
George Smoot
is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist,

33
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:38,889
one of the great minds of our time.

34
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:41,783
His work
in black body form and anisotropy

35
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:43,911
of the cosmic microwave
background radiation

36
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:47,231
cemented our understanding
of the origin of the universe.

37
00:01:47,464 --> 00:01:50,214
It's kind of a funny name, though.
"Smoot."

38
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,740
It's like talking to a chimp.

39
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:00,494
Now that I've been completely insulted,
have a good flight.

40
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,746
I wish.

41
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,789
We're not flying.
We're taking the train.

42
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,958
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah, cool.

43
00:02:06,423 --> 00:02:09,920
Seven times as long as flying,
and costs almost twice as much.

44
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,882
- Then why are you doing it?
- We had a vote.

45
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:16,343
Three of us voted for airplane.
Sheldon voted for train.

46
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,312
So we're taking the train.

47
00:02:19,996 --> 00:02:21,807
Don't say it like that.
Say it like:

48
00:02:22,056 --> 00:02:23,806
"We're taking the train!"

49
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,541
Subtitles: The FW Team

50
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:52,767
We're all going over
to the Apple store

51
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:55,591
to make fun of the guys
at the Genius Bar. You want to come?

52
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,094
I always enjoy that,
but I'm a little busy.

53
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,387
What are you doing?

54
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,765
I'm simplifying the task
of packing for our trip.

55
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,329
See, by attaching RFID tags
to my clothing,

56
00:03:05,454 --> 00:03:06,906
it will enable my laptop

57
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:09,145
to read and identify the items
with this wand.

58
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,748
I will then cross-reference
them against destination,

59
00:03:11,873 --> 00:03:13,456
anticipated activity spectrum,

60
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:16,531
weather conditions,
duration of trip, et cetera.

61
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:21,534
That does sound much simpler.

62
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,789
How long is this going to take?

63
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,429
Assuming I can keep up this pace,
three hours, 11 minutes.

64
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:31,348
Plus however long it takes to conclude
this fairly pointless conversation.

65
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:37,132
Teasing the guys at the Apple store
seems a little redundant now.

66
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,844
- I don't follow.
- I wouldn't expect you to. See you.

67
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:45,979
Socks: one pair,

68
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:49,013
cotton, argyle, blue.

69
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,264
Socks: one pair,

70
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:58,078
cotton, argyle, blue.

71
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:04,702
What on earth are you doing?

72
00:04:05,638 --> 00:04:08,289
Whatever it is,
I'm guessing we're doing it wrong.

73
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:12,167
Gentlemen,
this is the Coast Starlight,

74
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,159
one of the great American trains

75
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:17,089
operating on one of the classic
American routes.

76
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:20,092
On this side, you'll see
panoramic ocean vistas

77
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,747
inaccessible to any other form
of transportation,

78
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,515
while on your side,
you'll be treated to 350 miles

79
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,136
of CostCos, Jiffy Lubes,

80
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:30,419
and cinderblock homes
with above-ground pools.

81
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:35,190
- Come on, Raj.
- What's wrong with Jiffy Lubes?

82
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:41,785
- Why not?
- That's over the wheelbase.

83
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,358
Are you completely unfamiliar

84
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,098
with the suspension
characteristics of a pre-1980

85
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:49,173
Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe
passenger coach?

86
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,567
We've been on this train 90 seconds,

87
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,976
and you've already
said a thousand words.

88
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:56,712
Just tell us where to sit
and shut up.

89
00:04:59,024 --> 00:05:00,024
Here.

90
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:03,143
I'm hoping once you reap
the endorphic rewards

91
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:06,456
of the steady clickety-clack
of steel wheels on polished rails,

92
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:09,516
- your sour disposition will abate.
- Yeah, maybe.

93
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,070
Meanwhile, back in the 21st century,
people are raising their tray tables

94
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:15,226
and putting their seat-backs
in an upright position

95
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:17,811
'cause it's time to land
in San Francisco.

96
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:21,815
It's not so bad, really. At least
these trains have modern plumbing.

97
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,255
In India, you squat over a hole
in the train

98
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,480
and expose your naked buttocks
to the chilly air of Rajasthan.

99
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:31,369
He is referring, of course,
to third class on Indian Railways'

100
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:34,977
magnificent Ranakpur Express
and its 1,200-kilometer journey

101
00:05:35,177 --> 00:05:37,777
from Maharashtra
to the Bikaner Junction.

102
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,798
Oh, look, now he's boring
on an international scale.

103
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,217
Holy crap! Look!

104
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,014
- Is that who I think it is?
- It can't be.

105
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,600
What would Summer Glau
be doing riding the train?

106
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:55,807
Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's
protecting him from an evil Terminator.

107
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,669
Unlikely. That's a television show.

108
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,650
Thank you.

109
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:03,793
Of course, if SkyNet actually
did exist in the future,

110
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:06,331
a perfect way to infiltrate
and destroy mankind

111
00:06:06,456 --> 00:06:08,692
would be to send
Terminators back posing as actors

112
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:11,495
who have played Terminators
in popular films and television series,

113
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:13,714
lulling us
into a false sense of security,

114
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,723
i.e., "That's Summer Glau
from <i>The Sarah Connor Chronicles</i>.

115
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:19,611
"No, Summer, don't kill me!
I'm pro-robot!"

116
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,967
At least he's off the train crap.

117
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:33,622
I owe you an apology. Taking the train
was a stroke of brilliance!

118
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:35,936
I've actually got
a shot at a Terminator.

119
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:37,932
Please.
When it comes to Terminators,

120
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:41,483
you've got a better shot of scoring
with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

121
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,331
You're overlooking something.

122
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:48,436
I have 11 hours with her
in a confined space.

123
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,664
Unless she's willing
to jump off a moving train,

124
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:53,625
tuck and roll
down the side of a hill,

125
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,222
she will eventually succumb
to the acquired taste

126
00:06:57,347 --> 00:06:59,207
that is Howard Wolowitz.

127
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:04,715
My money's on tuck and roll.

128
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:07,903
I'm confused.
I thought you were involved

129
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,554
in some sort of socially intimate
pairing with Leslie Winkle.

130
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,144
- Let me explain to you how this works.
- All right.

131
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:17,102
That's Summer Glau.

132
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:20,008
That's it.

133
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:23,942
Hang on a sec.
Why do you get first crack at her?

134
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,918
Let's see, couple reasons.

135
00:07:26,043 --> 00:07:28,947
- One, I saw her first.
- No, you didn't. I did.

136
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:32,806
Fair enough.
But... then, let me move on to #2.

137
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:36,205
Unlike you, I can actually talk
to women when I'm sober.

138
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:38,746
You fail to take
into account that even mute,

139
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,693
I am foreign and exotic,

140
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:43,868
while you, on the other hand,
are frail and pasty.

141
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:47,608
You know the old saying,

142
00:07:47,798 --> 00:07:50,218
"Pasty and frail never fail."

143
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,059
Excuse me, but what about me?
Why don't I get a shot?

144
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:58,783
Fine, go ahead.

145
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,316
Take a shot.

146
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:05,025
I've already got a gorgeous blonde
back home that I can't score with.

147
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,944
I think I'll let you two
take this one.

148
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:09,780
Is there a place on this train
to get alcohol?

149
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,327
Interesting that you ask.

150
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:14,878
The Coast Starlight recently added
the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car.

151
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:18,405
Built in 1956 and originally known
as the Santa Fe Lounge Car,

152
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,583
the lower level is a theater
and the upper level is a bar that offers

153
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,670
wine tastings if you're going
as far as Portland.

154
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,191
- So aren't you going to go talk to her?
- I will, I'm just

155
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:29,811
working on my opening line.

156
00:08:29,936 --> 00:08:31,943
She's probably heard
every possible line.

157
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:33,553
Why don't you just try "hello"?

158
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:35,931
No, no,
that always creeps girls out.

159
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:39,100
I need to come up
with something that's funny,

160
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,804
smart and delicately suggests
that my sexual endowment

161
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,274
is disproportionate
to my physical stature.

162
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:49,068
You're going to need
more than 11 hours.

163
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,989
- Oh, no.
- What's the matter?

164
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:54,616
- I forgot my flash drive.
- So?

165
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,118
So we have to go back.

166
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:58,783
Okay, I'm going to say "why"

167
00:08:58,908 --> 00:09:02,458
and your answer cannot be
"because I forgot my flash drive."

168
00:09:03,324 --> 00:09:04,511
You don't understand.

169
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:07,187
My flash drive has my paper
on astrophysical probes

170
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:09,217
of M-theory effects
in the early universe

171
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,883
that I was going to give
to George Smoot at the conference.

172
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,219
Why do you have to give
your paper to George Smoot?

173
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:17,557
It's brilliant.
He needs to read it.

174
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:21,196
So you'll send him an e-mail
when we get back.

175
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,145
Then I won't get to see his face
light up as he reads it.

176
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:27,624
- Right. Of course.
- This is an unmitigated disaster.

177
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:30,245
There's nothing you can do about it,
so relax.

178
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,542
Sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack

179
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,573
of the steel wheels
on the polished rails.

180
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:42,933
You forgot your flash drive,
you forgot your flash drive...

181
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:49,296
Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go.

182
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,878
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

183
00:10:14,903 --> 00:10:16,810
So... where you gals headed?

184
00:10:18,442 --> 00:10:20,559
Okay, I've found
the perfect solution.

185
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:22,942
We get off the train
at the next stop in Oxnard.

186
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:26,291
We then take the 1:13 train
back to Union Station.

187
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,829
We take a cab back to the apartment,
get my flash drive,

188
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:32,160
and then race to San Luis Obispo,
where, assuming the lights are with us

189
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:34,406
and minimal traffic,
we'll meet the train.

190
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,896
- I've got a better idea.
- Are you going to be sarcastic?

191
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:40,180
You take all the fun
out of it for me.

192
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:44,499
Penny's home. Why don't we call her,
have her go in the apartment,

193
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:46,645
get your flash drive
and e-mail you the paper?

194
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,314
But the flash drive is
in a locked drawer in my desk.

195
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,650
- So?
- The key is hidden in my room.

196
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,694
- So?
- Penny would have to go into my room.

197
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,022
- So?
- People don't go in my room!

198
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,321
I see. It seems once again,

199
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:02,055
you're caught between a rock
and a crazy place.

200
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:06,039
I hate when that happens.

201
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,009
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

202
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:12,004
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

203
00:11:13,851 --> 00:11:15,835
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

204
00:11:17,822 --> 00:11:20,262
- That's cute.
- Really? I just made it up.

205
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,175
Have you seen <i>Slumdog Millionaire</i>?

206
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,435
Yeah, I loved it.

207
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,437
It's loosely based on my life.

208
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,385
We're putting the play on for one night
in this little 99-seat theater.

209
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,447
Can you come?

210
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:37,529
Oh, great.

211
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:40,703
Do you know 98 other people
that might want to come?

212
00:11:41,323 --> 00:11:42,323
Hang on.

213
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,338
Listen carefully.
I'm about to give you

214
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:48,058
a set of instructions
which you must follow to the letter.

215
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,270
Just a sec.

216
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,387
The theater is above a bowling alley,
so it's a little noisy,

217
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,540
but it might be the only chance
I'll ever get to play Anne Frank.

218
00:11:57,276 --> 00:11:58,788
And the director is brilliant.

219
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:01,735
He uses the bowling sounds
as, like, Nazi artillery.

220
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:03,847
Great, I'll see you then.

221
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:06,422
- Hello?
- <i>Okay, step four.</i>

222
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:11,104
Do you see that small plastic case
on my dresser?

223
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:13,065
Your dresser? Who is this?

224
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,234
- It's Sheldon.
- <i>Hey, Sheldon!</i>

225
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,185
- How is San Francisco?
- I'm not in San Francisco.

226
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,823
I'm on a train.
Were you even listening to me?

227
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,832
I was talking to my friend,
but what's up?

228
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,747
What's up? I'll tell you what's up.

229
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:28,618
I'm in a crisis situation,
and I need you to marshal

230
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:31,291
your powers of concentration,
limited as they may be...

231
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,807
Give me the phone.

232
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,546
- Hi, Penny. It's Leonard.
- <i>Hey, Leonard.</i>

233
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,733
What's going on
with Dr. Wackadoodle?

234
00:12:40,122 --> 00:12:41,823
He's calling to ask you a favor.

235
00:12:41,948 --> 00:12:44,240
You might be confused
because he didn't use the words,

236
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:46,765
"Penny," "Sheldon,"
"please" or "favor."

237
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,477
Enough chitchat.
Okay, step one.

238
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:53,021
Locate your emergency key
to our apartment.

239
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,268
<i>Step two:</i>

240
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,981
enter our apartment.
Step three:...

241
00:12:58,672 --> 00:13:00,070
Enter my bedroom.

242
00:13:00,627 --> 00:13:03,407
- <i>Step four:...</i>
- Hang on, getting another call.

243
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,064
Let me tell you.

244
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,769
Personal robots cannot get here
soon enough.

245
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:13,402
And that bright little star

246
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,543
peeking her head out early today...

247
00:13:15,832 --> 00:13:16,939
that's Venus.

248
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:19,172
That is so cool.

249
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:22,564
- You really know a lot about space.
- Come on.

250
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:24,847
When you were on TV in <i>Firefly</i>,

251
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,975
you were actually in space.

252
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:31,084
You're not one of those guys
who really believe that, are you?

253
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:33,563
You mean one of the hopeless geeks?

254
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:35,939
Those are crazy people.

255
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,025
Howard, be a dear
and get me another one of these.

256
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,974
Now, him, he's one of those geeks.

257
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:54,491
All right, now, before you enter
my bedroom unescorted,

258
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:57,690
I need you to understand
that this onetime grant of access

259
00:13:57,815 --> 00:14:00,136
does not create
a permanent easement.

260
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:02,757
Easement.

261
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,191
It's a legal right of access.
Good grief.

262
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:11,433
What? No, don't put me on hold.

263
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:15,910
Do you believe him?

264
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:18,369
Normally around women,
he has the personality

265
00:14:18,494 --> 00:14:20,069
of a boiled potato.

266
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,862
Put one beer in him,
and he's M. Night Charmalarmalon.

267
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,910
Is that what he's drinking?
It's not even real beer.

268
00:14:30,257 --> 00:14:31,286
- What?
- Look.

269
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:33,602
"Non-alcoholic beer."

270
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:37,943
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

271
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:40,545
Some sort of placebo effect,
I guess.

272
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:43,254
Placebo, you say.

273
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:44,527
Interesting.

274
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,497
Yes, I'm still here.
Where am I going? I'm on a train.

275
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:50,472
Now, what you'll be looking for

276
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,193
is a small wooden box located
between a Hoberman's sphere

277
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:56,801
and a sample of quartz
flecked with pyrite.

278
00:14:57,752 --> 00:14:59,155
Hoberman's Sphere.

279
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,912
It's a collapsible
icosidodecahedron.

280
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:06,160
No, the thing with the time on it
is my alarm clock.

281
00:15:09,696 --> 00:15:12,827
Actually, in India, the names
of constellations are different.

282
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:14,948
Where you have the Big Dipper,

283
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:16,926
we have the Big Curry Pot.

284
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,258
You're making that up.

285
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:21,383
You got me.

286
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,234
Now what are you
going to do with me?

287
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:30,795
Look.

288
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,722
- What am I looking at?
- You tell me.

289
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:35,545
"Non-alcoholic beer."

290
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,900
Hi. I'm the small package
good things come in.

291
00:15:50,654 --> 00:15:51,699
I got a box,

292
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,119
but there's no key in here.
Just letters.

293
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,912
That's the wrong box. Put it back.

294
00:15:56,812 --> 00:15:58,832
Are these letters
from your grandmother?

295
00:15:59,027 --> 00:16:00,417
Don't read those letters!

296
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,711
Look, she calls you "Moon Pie."
That is so cute.

297
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,306
Put down the letters!

298
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:10,534
Hey, Penny. It's Leonard.

299
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,657
- How's the train ride?
- Delightful.

300
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,296
I don't know what you're doing

301
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:19,436
but there are little bubbles forming
on the corners of Sheldon's mouth.

302
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,480
Yeah, I kind of crossed a line.
Put him back on.

303
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,715
Thank you.

304
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,278
- I'm back.
- What up, Moon Pie?

305
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:31,175
No one calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!

306
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,381
Hey, Penny. Leonard again.

307
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:40,999
In the dream, you and I
were ice skating, just the two of us.

308
00:16:41,404 --> 00:16:43,835
And then, I picked you up
by your ankles

309
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:48,006
and twirled you round and round
until your legs tore off.

310
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:52,302
I tried to stick them back on,

311
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,780
but before I could,

312
00:16:53,905 --> 00:16:57,607
you turned into a giant loaf
of pumpernickel bread.

313
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:00,101
What do you think that means?

314
00:17:01,657 --> 00:17:03,157
I really don't know.

315
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:06,447
I'll give you a clue.

316
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:09,181
My favorite sandwich?
Salami on pumpernickel.

317
00:17:10,908 --> 00:17:11,988
Is that so?

318
00:17:13,168 --> 00:17:14,545
Did you know "pumpernickel"

319
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,828
comes from the German words
"pumper" and "nickel,"

320
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,155
which loosely translates
to "fart goblin"?

321
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:23,565
I didn't.

322
00:17:27,157 --> 00:17:28,880
Okay, I found the box. Now what?

323
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,342
You're holding a Japanese puzzle box,
which takes

324
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,552
ten precise moves to open.

325
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,969
<i>First, locate the panel
with the diamond pattern</i>

326
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,851
and slide the center portion
one millimeter to the left.

327
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:44,305
<i>Then, on the opposite end
of the box,</i>

328
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,596
slide the entire panel down
two millimeters.

329
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:49,401
You'll hear a slight click.

330
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,460
Hang on.

331
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:53,238
Do you have any emotional attachment
to this box?

332
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,288
No, it's a novelty
I ordered off the Internet.

333
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:56,825
Did you hear the click?

334
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:57,993
Not yet.

335
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:03,118
There it is.

336
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:08,808
Okay, here's another one.

337
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:12,496
If you married the famous
rock guitarist Johnny Winter,

338
00:18:13,098 --> 00:18:14,684
you'd be Summer Winter.

339
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,306
I'm going to just go for broke here
and say I like you.

340
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:28,162
So here's my question:

341
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:30,836
do you realistically see
any conversational path

342
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:32,830
that would take us
from where we are right now

343
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:35,362
to a place where I could ask you out
and you'd say yes?

344
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,746
Fair enough.
I'll leave you in peace.

345
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:43,924
Thank you.

346
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,253
But before I go,

347
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:50,920
would you mind

348
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,466
if I take one picture of us together
for my Facebook page?

349
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,850
Sure.

350
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,197
Great. Now, can I take one
where it looks like we're making out?

351
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,919
Now you're going
to insert the flash drive

352
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:16,864
into the USB port...

353
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:22,209
She calls me Moon Pie

354
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:23,807
because I'm nummy-nummy

355
00:19:23,932 --> 00:19:25,744
and she could just eat me up.

356
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:31,182
Now, please put the flash drive
in the USB port.

357
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:36,591
The one that looks
like a little duck's mouth.

358
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:40,121
How'd it go?

359
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,971
Terminator broke my phone.

360
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:49,372
Excuse me.

361
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,731
I'll be honest with you.

362
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:56,380
I've just spent the last two hours
imaging various scenarios in my head,

363
00:19:56,505 --> 00:19:58,863
trying to come up
with some clever line to say to you.

364
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,032
But I finally realized
you're a human being;

365
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:02,553
I'm a human being.

366
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,702
- I could just say...
- <i>Next stop: Santa Barbara.</i>

367
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:06,384
I'm sorry. This is me.

368
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:10,796
Hi, my name's Leonard.

369
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,213
So, I'm thinking, you won

370
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,248
the Nobel Prize what,
three years ago?

371
00:20:18,373 --> 00:20:21,678
So you must deal with a whole lot
of "What has Smoot done lately?"

372
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,283
My thought is we continue
my research as a team...

373
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:28,601
you know, Cooper-Smoot,
alphabetical...

374
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,939
and when we win the Nobel Prize,
you'll be back on top.

375
00:20:33,722 --> 00:20:36,234
With all due respect, Dr. Cooper,
are you on crack?

376
00:20:40,544 --> 00:20:42,355
Fine!
Smoot-Cooper.

377
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:44,686
What a diva.
