1
00:00:04,442 --> 00:00:06,672
This movie baffles me
every time we watch it.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,110
What do you mean?

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,870
The instructions are very clear:

4
00:00:09,995 --> 00:00:12,011
"Don't feed the gremlins
after midnight."

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,763
"Don't get the gremlins wet."

6
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:19,561
How hard is that?

7
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:22,792
Hi, guys.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,367
Hi, honey.

9
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:26,567
We're "honey" now, are we?

10
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,229
Yes, since their relationship
became carnal,

11
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:31,947
Penny has upgraded
his designated term of endearment,

12
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:34,497
thus distinguishing him
from those she calls "sweetie,"

13
00:00:34,622 --> 00:00:37,448
usually in an attempt to soften
a thinly-veiled insult.

14
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:40,975
You're boring people, sweetie.

15
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:45,047
Although, sometimes,
she omits the veil entirely.

16
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:49,006
- So, what are you guys doing?
- Celebrating Columbus day.

17
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:51,467
We're watching <i>Goonies, Gremlins</i>
and <i>Young Sherlock Holmes</i>.

18
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,054
They're all written
by Chris Columbus.

19
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,058
Okay...
What do you watch on Thanksgiving?

20
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:00,502
The parade.

21
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:05,824
That reminds me... I usually go back
to Nebraska for Thanksgiving,

22
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:09,025
but this year they're calling it off
on account of my brother's trial.

23
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:10,736
What's he on trial for?

24
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:12,890
Just a big misunderstanding.

25
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:16,116
You'd actually like my brother.
He's kind of a chemist.

26
00:01:19,564 --> 00:01:21,303
I was thinking
I'd have Thanksgiving here,

27
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:23,457
- and you are all invited.
- I'll be there.

28
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:27,264
Will you be serving cranberry jelly
or cranberry sauce?

29
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:29,420
I guess I could serve both.

30
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,216
You guess? You don't seem
to have much of a handle on this.

31
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:37,190
Yeah, I really wish I could,
Penny, but every year,

32
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:39,848
my mother has all the relatives over
and cooks up

33
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,757
her famous tur-briska-fil.

34
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,436
Tur-briska-fil?

35
00:01:45,058 --> 00:01:47,897
Turkey stuffed with a brisket
stuffed with gefilte fish.

36
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:51,993
It's not as good as it sounds.

37
00:01:53,577 --> 00:01:56,490
- Raj, what about you?
- He usually comes to my house, right?

38
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:04,832
All right, this year, you don't have
to eat the tur-briska-fil.

39
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:08,794
I don't even chew it.
I swallow it like pills.

40
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,966
Episode 304: The Pirate Solution

41
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:17,118
Sync: Golgi, Jess, Loky

42
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,275
www.subbercafe.fr

43
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:37,530
So, what's going on with Raj?

44
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,462
Well, the good news is,

45
00:02:39,587 --> 00:02:42,406
he has no problem
with my mother's tur-briska-fil.

46
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:45,312
Hard to believe, but go on.

47
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,768
The bad news is,
he says he's getting deported.

48
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:50,419
He's getting deported?

49
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,755
It means that the U.S. Government
is going to expel him from the country.

50
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,982
He could either return
to his native India,

51
00:02:57,107 --> 00:02:59,272
emigrate to another country
that's willing to accept him

52
00:02:59,397 --> 00:03:01,805
or wander the high seas
as a stateless pirate.

53
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,269
Personally, I'd choose pirate.

54
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:11,190
Would you mind stepping outside
so we can speak to him?

55
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,335
Fine.

56
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,083
But the man really needs to work
on his girl issues.

57
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,183
Another reason to consider
a life of piracy.

58
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:21,200
Even today, I understand
that's an all-male profession.

59
00:03:23,835 --> 00:03:25,185
Okay, she's gone.

60
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:31,868
Sorry. I lost my cool.

61
00:03:33,732 --> 00:03:35,422
So, what's going on?

62
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:37,271
Okay, here's the deal:

63
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:39,176
six months ago, my research testing

64
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,559
the predicted composition
of trans-neptunian objects

65
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:42,846
ran into a dead end.

66
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:47,146
So, my visa's only good as long
as I'm employed at the university.

67
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:49,603
When they find out I've got squat,
they're going to cut me off.

68
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,456
By the way, when I say squat,
I mean diddly-squat.

69
00:03:54,737 --> 00:03:56,159
I wish I had squat.

70
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:00,710
So, wait, what have you been doing
for the past six months?

71
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,708
You know, checking e-mail,

72
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:05,127
updating my Facebook status,

73
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,661
messing up Wikipedia entries.

74
00:04:10,026 --> 00:04:13,202
Did you know Netflix lets you
stream movies on your computer now?

75
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,931
You've continued
to take the university's money

76
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,297
under false pretenses?

77
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,892
Highly unethical
for an astrophysicist.

78
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:22,578
Although practically mandatory
for a pirate.

79
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,534
I don't want to go back to India.
It's hot and loud,

80
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:29,823
and there's so many people.

81
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,980
You have no idea...
They're everywhere.

82
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,568
Okay, guys, think.
How do we keep Raj in the country?

83
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:45,746
Why doesn't he just get another job?

84
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:55,643
What are you asking me for?
I don't know if you can talk now or not.

85
00:05:01,023 --> 00:05:02,073
Oh, beef...

86
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:04,573
I'm going to miss you so much.

87
00:05:05,898 --> 00:05:08,650
Do you know, at the Mumbai Mcdonald's,
you can't get a Big Mac?

88
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,851
All you can get
is a Chicken Maharaja Mac.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,883
And the special sauce: curry,

90
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:16,731
which, in India, believe you me,
is really not that special.

91
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:20,299
Don't worry,
you'll find another job.

92
00:05:20,424 --> 00:05:22,158
Yeah, let me start
practicing for it.

93
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:24,072
"Do you want fries with
that Maharaja Mac?"

94
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:27,659
Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.

95
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,153
Hello, Sheldon.

96
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:33,415
Forgive me, as you know,
I'm not adept at reading facial cues,

97
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,525
but I'm going to take a stab here:
you're either sad or nauseated.

98
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:39,671
Sad.

99
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,299
I was going to say sad.
I don't know why I hedged.

100
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:45,700
What are you eating?

101
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:48,680
Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger
and tomato sauce.

102
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:50,430
Oh, beefaroni.

103
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,434
I think I'll miss you most of all.

104
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,105
I've always been a little confused.
Why don't Hindus eat beef?

105
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,963
- We believe cows are gods.
- Not technically.

106
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:02,529
In hinduism,
cattle are thought to be like god.

107
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,465
Do not tell me about my own culture!

108
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,490
In the mood I'm in, I'll take you out...
I swear to cow!

109
00:06:10,214 --> 00:06:10,994
Sorry.

110
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,621
Me, too. I'm...
I'm a little on edge.

111
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:17,021
Understandable, your entire life seems
to be crumbling around you,

112
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:19,212
and your future
appears bleak at best.

113
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:21,337
Thank you.

114
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:23,213
And you're wrong
about hinduism and cows.

115
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:27,183
Raj, guess what.
Professor Laughlin is looking

116
00:06:27,308 --> 00:06:29,471
for someone to join
the stellar evolution research team.

117
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:31,842
You're kidding! That's fantastic!

118
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,808
Call him and set up an interview.

119
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:34,851
I'm on it.

120
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,865
That's happy, right?

121
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,021
Nailed it.

122
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:42,066
Dr. Koothrappali, come on in.

123
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:45,028
I was surprised to hear you were
interested in joining our little team.

124
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:47,886
Giving up on those
trans-Neptunian objects, are we?

125
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:49,752
No, it's a very promising area.

126
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:52,035
In a perfect world,
I'd spend several more years on it.

127
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,127
But I just couldn't pass up
the opportunity

128
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:56,502
to work with you
on your tremendously exciting

129
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:59,167
and not yet conclusively
disproved hypothesis.

130
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,566
Splendid.

131
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:01,991
Please sit down.

132
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:05,256
- Can I offer you a sherry?
- It's a little early, isn't it?

133
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:07,196
Not on Proxima Centauri.

134
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:09,378
That's very good.

135
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:10,989
Jolly amusing,

136
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:14,614
but if you don't mind,
I'll hold off until sunset on Titan.

137
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:16,005
Well done.

138
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,852
I have a feeling
you're going to fit in just fine.

139
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,277
Thank you, sir.

140
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:23,399
I'm sorry. Am I late?

141
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:24,901
No, right on time.

142
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:28,571
Dr. Koothrappali,
may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT.

143
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,740
She'll be heading up
our data analysis team.

144
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,117
It's nice to meet you,
Dr. Koothrappali.

145
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,630
I read your paper on Kuiper belt
object size distribution.

146
00:07:37,755 --> 00:07:39,707
I really enjoyed it.

147
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:45,838
How did you correct
for the selection bias?

148
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,460
Well, I ran a simulation

149
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:52,220
that allowed me to correct
for the observational efficiency.

150
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:54,082
That's just fascinating.

151
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,258
Thank you.

152
00:07:57,573 --> 00:08:00,603
Would you like to hear more about it
in my hot tub?

153
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,009
So, when do I start?

154
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,532
What do you mean you didn't get the job?
How could you not get it?

155
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:14,349
You know...

156
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:16,891
He's British; I'm Indian.

157
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:20,665
Ever since Gandhi,
they haven't liked us very much.

158
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:23,182
Are you saying
he discriminated against you?

159
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:24,961
Because we should file a complaint.

160
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,580
That's okay.
A complaint's been filed.

161
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:32,468
So, that's it.
That was my last hope.

162
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,016
I'm going to be deported,
sent home in disgrace,

163
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,076
exposed to the sardonic barbs
of my cousin Sanjay.

164
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:42,395
Or, as you may know him,
Dave from AT&T customer service.

165
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:49,777
I'm really going to miss you.

166
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:52,373
Will you come visit me in India?

167
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,190
Gee, that's, like, a 17-hour flight.

168
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,285
I'll meet you halfway.

169
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,620
Halfway is 600 miles
off the coast of Japan.

170
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:02,665
Tell you what, we'll Skype.

171
00:09:06,203 --> 00:09:07,203
Gentlemen.

172
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,256
Did you get the job
with professor Laughlin?

173
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:13,205
I assumed as much.
But never fear.

174
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,281
Like the subordinate male protagonist
in countless action movies

175
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:18,431
who disappears halfway
through the second reel,

176
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,906
I have returned to save the day.

177
00:09:24,638 --> 00:09:26,729
Odd.
Usually, he's met by cheers.

178
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,277
I was thinking about exploring
the string theory implications

179
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:33,518
of gamma rays
from dark matter annihilations.

180
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:36,032
- And it occurred to me...
- Excuse me, Sheldon.

181
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,285
How many reels before the subordinate
male protagonist gets to his point?

182
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,333
Sorry...
if you didn't cheer at my entrance,

183
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,908
it's too late
to buy into the premise.

184
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:49,396
Anyway, I got some extra money
from the head of the department,

185
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,845
and Raj can come work for me.

186
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:54,935
You want me to work with you?

187
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,434
For me.

188
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,723
You're going to have to listen
more carefully when you're on the job.

189
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:03,337
Please don't take this
the wrong way,

190
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:06,405
but I'd rather swim buck-naked
across the Ganges

191
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,480
with a paper cut on my nipple

192
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,588
and die a slow, agonizing death

193
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:13,117
from a viral infection
than work with you.

194
00:10:15,592 --> 00:10:16,592
For me.

195
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,190
Sheldon, are you busy?

196
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:29,851
Of course I'm busy.

197
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,380
- Shall I wait?
- Yes, please.

198
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:47,979
How may I help you?

199
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:51,941
I've reconsidered your offer
to let me work with you.

200
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:53,653
For me.

201
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:56,070
Yes, for you.

202
00:10:56,717 --> 00:10:58,322
I do, however,
have a few conditions.

203
00:10:58,781 --> 00:11:00,095
First, at all times,

204
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,319
I am to be treated
as a colleague and an equal.

205
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:05,345
Second, my contributions shall be noted
in all published materials.

206
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,357
And third,

207
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:10,056
you are never allowed to lecture me
on Hinduism or my Indian culture.

208
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:12,795
I'm impressed, Raj.

209
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,386
Those are very cogent
and reasonable conditions.

210
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:17,711
- Thank you.
- I reject them all.

211
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:20,785
Then you leave me no choice.

212
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,256
I accept the job.

213
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:26,366
I'm sorry,
I believe you've misunderstood.

214
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:28,284
I'm not giving you the job.

215
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:31,230
I'm simply affording you
the opportunity to apply for it.

216
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,723
Have a seat;
we'll get started with the interview.

217
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:38,448
You're kidding!

218
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:39,738
Please.

219
00:11:41,472 --> 00:11:42,472
All right.

220
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:46,284
So...

221
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:52,042
That's what you wear
to an interview?

222
00:11:53,315 --> 00:11:54,962
Come on,
we've been friends for years.

223
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:57,527
Pulling strings, are we?

224
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,593
Sheldon, for God's sakes,
don't make me beg.

225
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,639
Bazinga!

226
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,368
You've fallen victim to another one
of my classic practical jokes.

227
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:13,772
I'm your boss now.
You may want to laugh at that.

228
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:21,112
This is nice having the place
to ourselves, isn't it?

229
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:24,867
Now that Raj is working for Sheldon,
I don't have to chauffeur him around.

230
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,047
Plus, yeah, with them
working late so much,

231
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:28,990
we get some privacy.

232
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:34,418
Want to get a little crazy?

233
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:36,211
What are you thinking?

234
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:39,464
Let's slide over
to Sheldon's spot and make out.

235
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:43,904
You are a dirty girl.

236
00:12:47,678 --> 00:12:49,228
God, how did he know?

237
00:12:53,728 --> 00:12:55,105
Am I interrupting?

238
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:56,815
Little bit, yeah.

239
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,568
- Guess I should have called.
- Yeah, maybe.

240
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:09,942
Tonight's the night
I usually go line dancing

241
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:11,817
with Raj at the Palomino.

242
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:17,044
But he's working with Sheldon.

243
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,359
Yes, we know.

244
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:20,768
Want me to leave?

245
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:22,549
You know, whatever.

246
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:26,221
I guess I can hang
for a little while.

247
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:29,695
So what are we watching?

248
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:31,855
<i>Sex and the City</i>.
Yikes.

249
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:34,694
I happen to love this movie.

250
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,229
Fine, let's watch it.

251
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:39,606
Maybe all our periods
will synchronize.

252
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,448
All right, we're going to be
designing an experiment

253
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,354
to look
for the annihilation spectrum

254
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:50,786
resulting from dark matter
collisions in space.

255
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:54,317
Dark matter.
We better bring a flashlight.

256
00:13:57,647 --> 00:13:59,948
- I was making a joke.
- I'm the boss.

257
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,423
I make the jokes.

258
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:05,175
Sorry. Go ahead, make your joke.

259
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:07,443
This is not the time for joking.

260
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:11,681
We're doing serious research,
which requires complete and utter focus.

261
00:14:12,448 --> 00:14:14,298
Let's buckle down and work.

262
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:48,444
- I need an aspirin.
- Top desk drawer.

263
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,502
- Thank you.
- All right?

264
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:57,707
- Yes.
- Good.

265
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:08,111
That was fun.

266
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:09,764
Thank you.

267
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,742
You don't have to say thank you
every time we have sex.

268
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:18,844
Tomorrow you'll get a card in the mail.
Just throw it away.

269
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,421
Top o' the mornin' to ya!

270
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:28,675
What are you doing here?

271
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,331
Well, usually, on sundays,
I go with Raj

272
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:33,706
to scam on hippie chicks
at the farmers market,

273
00:15:34,944 --> 00:15:37,579
but he's still working with Sheldon,
so I thought I'd come over here

274
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:40,061
and make you guys
scrambled eggs and salami.

275
00:15:42,018 --> 00:15:44,568
It's the perfect meal
for <i>après l'amour</i>.

276
00:15:47,274 --> 00:15:48,278
Kill me.

277
00:15:48,724 --> 00:15:51,082
By the way, I couldn't help
overhearing your big finish.

278
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:52,457
Bravo, Leonard.

279
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:57,970
If you had killed me
when I said "kill me",

280
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:00,103
I wouldn't have had to hear that.

281
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,168
Want to take in a matinée,
maybe go rollerblading,

282
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:05,107
catch a step class?

283
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:07,853
Do something.

284
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,468
Howard, we need to talk.

285
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,086
Sure. 'sup, Holmes?

286
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:18,892
Please understand that it's not that
we don't want you around,

287
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:21,227
but Penny and I
occasionally need some...

288
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:23,443
Alone time.

289
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:28,673
I get it,

290
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:30,834
I'm the third wheel.

291
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,031
Sorry, I should have seen that.

292
00:16:33,338 --> 00:16:35,033
I'll get out of your way.

293
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,495
You're gonna want to eat those eggs
while they're still hot.

294
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:45,305
There's lox and cream cheese
in the fridge.

295
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,179
The bagels are in the oven.
I was warming them up.

296
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,230
That's great.

297
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,328
I'm just going to hang out
with my mom.

298
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:55,853
That's always fun.

299
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,642
Good.

300
00:17:06,412 --> 00:17:09,012
- Are we terrible people?
- I don't know.

301
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:11,378
What do you want me to do?

302
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,364
Get him, bring him back.

303
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:16,164
Are you sure?

304
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,996
- Howard, come back.
- You guys had me scared for a minute.

305
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,646
That rate is much too low from
what we'd expect from this collision.

306
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:33,132
Do you understand we're talking about
dark matter colliding in outer space?

307
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:34,452
Of course.

308
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:36,886
Who are you to tell me
about outer space?

309
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:39,597
I'm the astrophysicist.
"Astro" means "space."

310
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:42,505
"Astro" means "star."

311
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:45,141
Let me tell you,

312
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:47,356
if we were having this argument
in my native language,

313
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:48,925
I'd be kicking your butt.

314
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,219
English is your native language.

315
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,828
You got me there,
but you're wrong about this!

316
00:17:57,574 --> 00:18:00,008
There is a fine line
between wrong and visionary.

317
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,403
Unfortunately, you have to be
a visionary to see it.

318
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:07,500
You think that every thought
coming out of your head is pure gold.

319
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:10,378
Let me tell you something.
Some of those thoughts are pure <i>caca</i>.

320
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:13,714
It means "doo-doo."

321
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,074
First of all, Dr. Koothrappali,

322
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:19,262
when I first proposed
that you work with me...

323
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:20,557
I'm working with you?

324
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,974
In this context,
"with me" means "for me".

325
00:18:23,827 --> 00:18:25,319
Well, in this context...

326
00:18:28,238 --> 00:18:29,605
If I'm wrong, prove it.

327
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:34,861
Here's where we derive the mass
of the dark matter particle.

328
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:37,352
- You've misstated the atomic weight.
- Let me finish.

329
00:18:37,477 --> 00:18:40,116
- You're defacing my work.
- I'm not defacing it, I'm fixing it.

330
00:18:40,284 --> 00:18:41,909
Give me the eraser.

331
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:43,286
I said give it to me.

332
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:45,417
Come and get it.

333
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:47,969
Fine.

334
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:52,895
Oh, Lord.

335
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:56,090
Dr. Koothrappali,

336
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:58,676
as your superior, I forbid you
from writing on my board!

337
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:01,512
- You are not my superior.
- I am in every way.

338
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,680
Oh, yeah?

339
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:04,199
Can you do this?

340
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,548
Nice working with you.

341
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:15,116
I'm sorry... for you.

342
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,388
- I'm busy.
- Doing what?

343
00:19:48,096 --> 00:19:50,436
- You've made your point.
- What do you want?

344
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:53,814
I looked over the board
and it turns out you were right.

345
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:55,608
- You were wrong.
- I didn't say that.

346
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:58,778
- That's the only logical inference.
- Nevertheless, I didn't say it.

347
00:20:00,822 --> 00:20:02,781
I would like you
to come back and work for me.

348
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,867
For you or with you?

349
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:09,101
In this context,
"for me" could mean "with me".

350
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:11,207
- I have conditions.
- I reject them all.

351
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,775
I'll take the job.

352
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:15,821
See you monday.

353
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:18,714
- Wait, you have to drive me home.
- How did you get here?

354
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:20,341
- I walked.
- So walk home.

355
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:22,843
I can't.
There's a big dog outside.

356
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:29,006
On the way home,

357
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:31,543
we can start thinking about methods
of optimizing the detector

358
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:33,268
for 500 gev particles.
