1
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,861
Will you please turn
your shirt off?

2
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:24,032
What?

3
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,699
I'm giving myself
dramatic entrance music.

4
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,804
People will know I'm awesome
and to be feared.

5
00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:30,407
Right.

6
00:00:30,442 --> 00:00:32,745
There's nothing more awesome
and frightening than a man

7
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:35,816
who's got music blasting
from between his nipples.

8
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:39,820
Hey, Stuart,
what's going on?

9
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:42,021
Well, you might want to mark
your Google calendars.

10
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:44,591
Stan Lee is coming to do
a signing on Thursday.

11
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,426
Did he finally write a sequel
to his autobiography?

12
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:51,263
I'm sure ages 79 through 87
were just action-packed.

13
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:54,065
No, just a regular
comic signing.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,570
My uncle is his dermatologist
and Stan's doing him a favor.

15
00:00:57,604 --> 00:00:59,906
Oh, I don't want
to know that!

16
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:02,312
How can I possibly discuss
with Stan Lee

17
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:03,913
the scientific foundations

18
00:01:03,948 --> 00:01:05,749
for interstellar flight
on a silver surfboard

19
00:01:05,784 --> 00:01:07,820
when part of my brain
will be scanning his face

20
00:01:07,854 --> 00:01:11,391
for signs of contagious
skin disease?

21
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:14,861
Stan Lee does not have
a contagious skin disease.

22
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:18,867
Well, look who thinks
he's Stuart's uncle now.

23
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:20,068
Can't believe it.

24
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:22,537
We're going to meet Stan Lee!

25
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,214
I'm sad to say
I taught him those moves.

36
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:02,403
I can't decide

37
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:03,604
whether I want Stan Lee
to autograph

38
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:06,240
my <i>Journey into Mystery</i> 83,
first appearance of Thor

39
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,076
or my <i>Fantastic Four</i>
number five,

40
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,013
first appearance of Dr. Doom.

41
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,326
Alex, I'm going to go
with what is...

42
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,495
you're a dumbass?

43
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:32,870
I've decided I'm going to
have Mr. Lee sign my copy

44
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:34,906
of this month's <i>Batman.</i>

45
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,040
That's crazy.

46
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:38,076
Stan Lee had nothing
to do with <i>Batman.</i>

47
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,544
Yes, which is why no one else
will ask him to sign one,

48
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:43,647
and I will be the possessor
of a unique, albeit
confusing, artifact,

49
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:47,184
which will set me apart from
hoi polloi of comic book fandom.

50
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,020
That's a great idea.

51
00:02:50,055 --> 00:02:53,224
I'm going to get him
to sign a <i>Batman</i> as well.

52
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:56,995
What is it about the word
"unique" you don't understand?

53
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:58,430
Ow!

54
00:02:58,464 --> 00:02:59,564
Damn, paper cut.

55
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,799
Nothing worse than a paper cut.

56
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:04,002
Well, obviously you don't
remember your circumcision.

57
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:08,841
There's Neosporin and Band-Aids
in my top desk drawer.

58
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,144
Why don't you keep that stuff
in the bathroom?

59
00:03:12,178 --> 00:03:13,545
He does. And in the kitchen.

60
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,781
And in the car.
And in his pocket.

61
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:18,283
Yeah, but the ones in
my pocket are mine.

62
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:21,487
Hi!
Hey.

63
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,489
Guess who's going to be at the
comic bookstore on Thursday?

64
00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:25,291
Um... can you give me a hint?

65
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:27,126
Stan Lee.

66
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,128
Um... Stanley...

67
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:31,364
Stanley... Stanley Tucci?

68
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:32,899
No.

69
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,235
No, Stan... Lee.

70
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:37,671
Oh, oh, Stan Lee!

71
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:40,541
Cool!

72
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:42,977
You have no idea
who he is, do you?

73
00:03:43,011 --> 00:03:44,913
Of course I do.

74
00:03:44,947 --> 00:03:46,781
You're an important
part of my life

75
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:49,284
and I pay attention to the
things you are interested in.

76
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:50,951
Oh, good.

77
00:03:50,986 --> 00:03:52,319
Good.

78
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:53,554
So, who's Stan Lee?

79
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:56,991
Um... he was on <i>Star Trek.</i>

80
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:01,529
Nope.

81
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:03,665
<i>Star Wars?</i>
No.

82
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,467
Um... uh, Stan Lee.

83
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:08,936
Ooh, he was in those goofy
kung fu movies you love so much?

84
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:11,539
That's Bruce Lee.

85
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:12,740
Oh.

86
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:15,610
So, is this Bruce Lee's
nerdy brother, Stan?

87
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,280
Sheldon, why do you have
all these unopened

88
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:20,916
paychecks in your desk?

89
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,018
Because most of the things
I'm planning to buy

90
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:25,620
haven't been invented yet.

91
00:04:25,654 --> 00:04:28,289
There-there must be thousands
of dollars here.

92
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:30,025
Why don't you put it
in the bank?

93
00:04:30,059 --> 00:04:31,493
I don't trust banks.

94
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:33,395
I believe that when
the robots rise up,

95
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:36,064
ATMs will lead the charge.

96
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,601
You've also got something

97
00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:40,570
from the Pasadena
Municipal Court.

98
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:43,439
Undoubtedly another
snide response

99
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:45,141
to my repeated letters
complaining

100
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:46,809
that the flags in front
of the courthouse

101
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:47,910
are flying in the wrong order.

102
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:49,544
From left to right,
it's supposed to be

103
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:52,380
federal, state,
and then city of Pasadena.

104
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:55,583
I'm sorry. You sent more
than one letter about that?

105
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:59,153
It bothers me.

106
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:02,056
Sheldon, this is a summons.

107
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,690
A summons for what?

108
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:07,228
Looks like you ran a red light
on Marengo Avenue

109
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:10,699
at 9:30 p.m.
on November 16.

110
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:11,933
They got you
on a traffic camera.

111
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:15,037
Nice picture.

112
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:20,510
November 16?

113
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:23,012
Penny, that's the evening
you fell in your bathtub

114
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:25,148
and I had to drive you
to the emergency room.

115
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:26,583
No, it isn't.

116
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,251
Yes, it is.

117
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,853
No, it isn't.

118
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:31,388
Penny, I have an
eidetic memory.

119
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:33,556
Also, that's a picture of
you in the passenger seat

120
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:35,225
holding your dislocated
shoulder.

121
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:37,561
Mmm, no, it isn't.

122
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:42,700
Okay, then why is a summons
for a traffic violation

123
00:05:42,735 --> 00:05:45,236
committed in your car,
bearing your license plates,

124
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:47,005
coming to me?

125
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,646
Okay, look, they sent me
the ticket.

126
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,880
I told them
I wasn't driving

127
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:56,749
and they were all,
"If it wasn't you, who was it?"

128
00:05:56,783 --> 00:05:58,751
So you betrayed me?

129
00:05:58,785 --> 00:05:59,885
No!

130
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,353
It wasn't a betrayal.

131
00:06:01,388 --> 00:06:04,023
It was more of a "I can't afford
any more points on my license."

132
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:05,391
I already have
to buy my insurance

133
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:07,860
from this place
in the Cayman Islands.

134
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:10,429
But the only reason
I was driving your car

135
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:13,399
was because you were in distress
and I was rescuing you.

136
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:14,567
Yes, yes, look, and now

137
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:17,402
you have a photo to remember
that heroic day.

138
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,405
It's not that big a deal.

139
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,640
You just go down to the court
on Thursday

140
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:23,708
and you pay the fine.

141
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:25,576
I'm not going
to pay a fine.

142
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,111
That would imply
I'm guilty.

143
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:28,747
You are guilty.

144
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:36,088
That one I liked.

145
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:39,124
I am not guilty.

146
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,726
I only have a
learner's permit.

147
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:41,961
Penny was the teacher.

148
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:44,063
When the light turned yellow
she said "Go, go, go."

149
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:46,833
So I went, went, went.

150
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:47,934
Sheldon, I'm sorry.

151
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:49,802
I'll be happy to reimburse you
for the fine.

152
00:06:49,837 --> 00:06:51,637
You know, as soon
as I get a part in a movie

153
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:53,506
or my own TV series.

154
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,042
You don't need to reimburse
me because I'm not paying.

155
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:58,344
On Thursday, I will
have my day in court

156
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:00,079
and justice will be done.

157
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:03,316
In fact, I'm going to begin
preparing my defense right now.

158
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:07,420
Okay, he's going to jail.

159
00:07:07,454 --> 00:07:09,489
Oh, that's right.

160
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:11,624
Thursday is Stan Lee Day.

161
00:07:13,494 --> 00:07:15,628
Now you see what you've done?

162
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:19,933
Because of you, we're all
going to miss Stan Lee.

163
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:22,302
Whoa!

164
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:24,837
What do you mean "all?"

165
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:26,572
Well, you're my friends.

166
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:29,108
You'll be standing
by my side, supporting me,

167
00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:30,609
feeding me
legal precedents,

168
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:32,277
and if you had the
upper body strength,

169
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:35,681
carrying me out on your
shoulders when I'm victorious.

170
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:38,950
Yeah, okay. No.

171
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:41,018
Are you saying that you
will not stand beside me

172
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:42,487
as I plead my case?

173
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:44,555
That's what I'm saying.

174
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,957
Howard?

175
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:46,991
Wow.

176
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:49,961
Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court.

177
00:07:49,996 --> 00:07:51,997
Uh, if this was <i>Sophie's Choice</i>

178
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:54,099
it would've been a much
shorter movie. No.

179
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:56,034
Raj?

180
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,335
You'll be there, won't you?

181
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:02,641
All right, then.

182
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:05,076
My so-called friends
have forsaken me.

183
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:08,413
So, I guess it'll just be me
and my eyewitness.

184
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,816
Oh, balls.

185
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,084
Please try to wear something
appropriate.

186
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,351
It won't help my case

187
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:16,386
if the judge is busy trying
to read the word "Juicy"

188
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:18,088
scrawled across your buttocks.

189
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:25,828
Penny.

190
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:27,229
Penny.

191
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:29,365
Penny.

192
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:32,668
That's just wrong.

193
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:34,403
All right, let's go.

194
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:35,438
Wait, hold on.

195
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:37,106
Before we get to
the courthouse,

196
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,110
I'd like to call on
your skills as an actress.

197
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,411
What is this?

198
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:42,579
I've taken the liberty

199
00:08:42,613 --> 00:08:44,515
of scripting your appearance
on the witness stand

200
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:46,884
because, let's face it, you're
somewhat of a loose cannon.

201
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:49,454
Now, don't worry; it's written
in your vernacular.

202
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,855
So shall we rehearse?

203
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,023
Do I have a choice?

204
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:53,692
Well, of course
you have a choice.

205
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,228
Although we live
in a deterministic universe,

206
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:57,663
each individual has free will.

207
00:08:57,698 --> 00:08:59,699
Now, sit down.

208
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:02,469
I call your attention

209
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:04,471
to the events of November 16.

210
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:05,906
Do you remember that date?

211
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,576
"Darn tootin', I do.

212
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:13,146
"If the court will excuse
my homespun,

213
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,950
corn-fed Nebraskan
turn of phrase."

214
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:18,152
That's excellent. Go on.

215
00:09:18,186 --> 00:09:20,621
"The reason that date is, like,

216
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:23,057
"so totally fixed in my memory

217
00:09:23,091 --> 00:09:24,925
"is that I had the privilege
to be witness

218
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,661
to one of the most heroic acts
I've ever seen in, like, ever."

219
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,732
"And who performed
that heroic act?"

220
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:35,367
"Why, you did, sir.

221
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:37,670
"You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

222
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:40,839
And may I add, it is
a privilege to know you."

223
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:43,842
"There's no need
for compliments.

224
00:09:43,877 --> 00:09:45,811
This court is only interested
in the facts."

225
00:09:45,845 --> 00:09:49,781
"But it is a fact that
it's a privilege to know you.

226
00:09:49,815 --> 00:09:51,916
Totally."

227
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:56,588
A teardrop rolls down my cheek?!

228
00:09:56,623 --> 00:09:58,057
Only a suggestion.

229
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:00,526
A catch in your throat
would work just as well.

230
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:04,464
"But it is a fact

231
00:10:04,498 --> 00:10:07,200
"that it's a privilege
to know you.

232
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:09,369
Totally."

233
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:15,574
Maybe you should put on
your "Juicy" pants again.

234
00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:19,645
Pay the cashier.

235
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,548
Sheldon Cooper.

236
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:26,685
Good morning, Your Honor.

237
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,353
Dr. Sheldon Cooper

238
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:30,055
appearing in pro se.

239
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,257
That is to say,
representing himself.

240
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:33,659
I know what it means.

241
00:10:33,693 --> 00:10:34,960
I went to law school.

242
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:37,497
And yet you wound up
in traffic court.

243
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:40,266
Anyway,

244
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,434
if it would please the court,

245
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:43,102
I'd like to begin
with an opening statement.

246
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:44,236
The court would

247
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:45,771
advise you to make it quick,

248
00:10:45,806 --> 00:10:48,541
as the court had a dicey-looking
breakfast burrito this morning

249
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:50,443
and just took an Imodium.

250
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:52,578
Very well.

251
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:54,881
A quick opening statement.

252
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,017
Like a milking stool,

253
00:10:57,051 --> 00:10:58,586
my case rests on

254
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,821
three legs.

255
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:01,189
I will demonstrate

256
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:03,058
that I was improperly
instructed in driving

257
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:05,461
by a woman whose lack of respect
for society

258
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:06,929
borders on the sociopathic.

259
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:08,830
I will argue

260
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:11,266
that the emergency met
the legal doctrine

261
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:13,335
of <i>quod est necessarium</i>
<i>est licitum--</i>

262
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:15,571
that which is necessary
is legal.

263
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:16,805
But first,

264
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,741
I will raise
a Sixth Amendment issue.

265
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:21,176
I'm unable
to confront my accuser,

266
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:23,245
a non-human
entity, to wit,

267
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,614
a camera.

268
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:25,948
So, to sum up:

269
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:26,983
improper instruction;

270
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:29,018
<i>quod est necessarium</i>
<i>est licitum;</i>

271
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:30,186
Sixth Amendment.

272
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:32,088
My milk stool is complete.

273
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:33,323
Impressive.

274
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:34,023
Thank you.

275
00:11:34,057 --> 00:11:34,957
Guilty.

276
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:36,926
Pay the cashier.

277
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:38,261
I object.

278
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:40,063
You're completely ignoring
the law.

279
00:11:40,097 --> 00:11:41,798
No, I'm <i>following</i> the law.

280
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:43,633
I'm ignoring <i>you.</i>

281
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:44,934
Really?

282
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:48,337
I would point out that I am
at the top of my profession,

283
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:51,240
while you preside
over the kiddy table of yours.

284
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:54,310
Dr. Cooper,
before I find you in contempt

285
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:57,481
and throw you in jail,
I'm going to give you a chance

286
00:11:57,515 --> 00:11:59,316
to apologize
for that last remark.

287
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,017
I am a scientist.

288
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:03,353
I never apologize for the truth.

289
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,963
That's my spot.

290
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:20,006
<i>♪</i>
I can't wait to ask Stan Lee

291
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,276
why he insists on giving all his
characters first and last names

292
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:24,944
that start with the same letter.

293
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,380
Oh, come on.
Why would you do that?

294
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,415
Bruce Banner, Reed Richards,

295
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,083
Sue Storm, Stephen Strange,

296
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,751
Otto Octavius,
Silver Surfer,

297
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,987
Peter Parker, oh,
and worst of all,

298
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:39,659
J. Jonah Jameson, Jr.

299
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,528
Okay, I'm cutting.

300
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:45,232
I'm not gonna talk to Stan Lee
after you cheese him off.

301
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:51,105
Hey.

302
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,540
Sheldon's in jail.

303
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:53,875
Sheldon's in jail?!

304
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:57,145
You called it.

305
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:58,880
What do you think?
For what?

306
00:12:58,914 --> 00:13:00,981
For doing the same crap
he always does,

307
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:02,349
except to a judge.

308
00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:05,218
He has to stay in there
until he apologizes.

309
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:07,253
So tell him to apologize.

310
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:08,588
Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard.

311
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,489
That didn't occur to me.

312
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,124
If he doesn't apologize by 5:00,

313
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,092
he is going to spend the night
in jail.

314
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,461
Oh, no, that's terrible.

315
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,462
Ooh, the line's moving.
Got to go. Bye.

316
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:30,140
Excuse me?

317
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:31,575
Excuse me, jailor?

318
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,877
What?

319
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:35,579
I need to use the restroom.

320
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:37,380
Knock yourself out.

321
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,351
That's the toilet?

322
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:44,553
Well, it ain't
a wishing well.

323
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:48,957
Please tell the judge
I'm ready to apologize.

324
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:53,561
Look at that.

325
00:13:53,595 --> 00:13:55,629
"To my friend, Leonard.

326
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:58,565
From Stan Lee, Excelsior!"

327
00:14:00,002 --> 00:14:01,035
Awesome.

328
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:03,070
Mine says,
"To my friend, Howard.

329
00:14:03,104 --> 00:14:05,839
From Stan Lee, Excelsior!"

330
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:10,277
Mine says,
"To Raj, from Stan Lee."

331
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:16,816
That's 'cause you pissed him off
about his character names.

332
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:18,084
Hey,

333
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:20,987
I didn't even mention
Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin,

334
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:22,755
Matt Murdock,
Pepper Potts,

335
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,290
Victor Von Doom,

336
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:26,325
oh, and worst of all,

337
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,794
Millie the Model.

338
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:30,629
We're home.

339
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,498
Oh, hey, buddy. How'd it go?

340
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:34,433
You know very well
how it went.

341
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:37,602
Yeah, but we all want
to hear it from you.

342
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:42,374
I was found guilty
and fined $533.

343
00:14:42,408 --> 00:14:44,810
I'm going to write you
a check for that.

344
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:46,812
As long as you promise
to put it in your drawer

345
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:50,183
and never cash it,
like the others.

346
00:14:51,686 --> 00:14:53,553
I also now have
three points

347
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:56,223
on a driver's license
I do not yet possess,

348
00:14:56,257 --> 00:14:58,592
and I was forced
to issue an undeserved apology,

349
00:14:58,626 --> 00:15:00,594
simply because
I refuse to urinate

350
00:15:00,628 --> 00:15:04,664
in a stainless steel bowl
in front of criminals.

351
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:07,334
Plus, you didn't get
to meet Stan Lee.

352
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:09,903
Okay, that's enough, Howard.

353
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:11,938
The poor guy's
had a tough time.

354
00:15:11,972 --> 00:15:14,340
He had to spend
the entire afternoon in jail

355
00:15:14,374 --> 00:15:16,409
wearing that suit.

356
00:15:16,443 --> 00:15:19,445
You're right,

357
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,914
so it would be cruel to mention

358
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:22,216
that after he finished
signing autographs,

359
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,819
Stanley took Stuart and us out
for gelato.

360
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:29,890
You had gelato
with Stan Lee?

361
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:32,226
He said we could call him Stan.

362
00:15:33,194 --> 00:15:35,329
Except for Raj.

363
00:15:39,668 --> 00:15:42,303
Well, I hope you're
satisfied, Penny.

364
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:43,637
You are responsible

365
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:47,175
for all the evil that
has befallen me today.

366
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:48,943
Okay, I realize that...
Not finished.

367
00:15:48,977 --> 00:15:50,345
It is because of you

368
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:52,080
that I now have
a criminal record,

369
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:54,449
and it is because of you
that I missed out

370
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:56,184
on having gelato
with Stan Lee.

371
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:58,487
Okay, maybe you'll have
another chance to have...
No, no.

372
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:01,657
I will never have another chance
to have gelato with Stan Lee

373
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:03,192
because
opportunities to have

374
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:06,196
gelato with Stan Lee come
but once in a lifetime.

375
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,868
"The moving finger writes,
and having writ, moves on!"

376
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:19,678
Did he just somehow
give me the finger?

377
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,279
Not just the finger.

378
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,948
The moving finger.

379
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,919
Hey, Stuart.

380
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,622
Oh, hey, Penny.

381
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,659
Wow. Hi.

382
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,226
What's going on?
Nothing.

383
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,763
I'm just getting ready to
close up and... head out.

384
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:41,198
Ah.

385
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:43,033
Cool. Got any fun plans?

386
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,903
Oh, yeah. Big night tonight.

387
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:48,573
Gonna share a can of tuna

388
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,808
with the cat.

389
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,843
Oh, nice.

390
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:54,277
Not even my cat.

391
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:56,046
I just feed it.

392
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,216
Some nights it
doesn't even show up.

393
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,684
Oh, okay.

394
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,687
Well, I was hoping, um,

395
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,055
you could do me a favor.

396
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,456
Sure, yeah, name it.

397
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,792
Well, I'm kind of responsible
for Sheldon missing Stan Lee,

398
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,861
and I really want
to make it up to him.

399
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,164
So I was hoping you could
give me his phone number

400
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,832
so maybe I can arrange
for them to meet.

401
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,101
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't
<i>have</i> his phone number.

402
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,436
Hmm. Damn.

403
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,803
Mm.
All right. Thank you.

404
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,271
Mm-hmm.

405
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,974
Wait.

406
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,575
I have his address.

407
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,010
Really?

408
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,277
Great!

409
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,380
But I can't give it to you.

410
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:32,282
Then why did you tell me
you had it?

411
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:35,118
I don't know.
Just chatting.

412
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:37,355
You're looking at a guy

413
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,189
who could very well
get stood up

414
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,491
by a stray cat tonight.

415
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:42,226
I'm sorry, Stuart.

416
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,494
Thanks anyway.

417
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,330
Mm-hmm.

418
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,365
Wait.

419
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,234
Yeah?

420
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,003
Maybe we can make a deal.

421
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,072
What kind of deal?

422
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,041
I will give you the address

423
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:58,144
if you go to my
cousin's wedding with me.

424
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,545
You're extorting
a date out of me?

425
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,612
I kind of have to.

426
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,214
The cousin
who's getting married

427
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,650
is the cousin I usually
go to weddings with.

428
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:07,051
Can I bring Leonard?

429
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:09,353
Sure. What the hell.

430
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,654
Deal.

431
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,823
We'll tell people
he's your cousin.

432
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:17,260
This is Stan Lee's
front door.

433
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:18,996
We were on Stan
Lee's curb,

434
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,631
then we were on
Stan Lee's walk,

435
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:22,266
and now we're
at Stan Lee's

436
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,334
front door.

437
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,303
Yup.

438
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,773
Oh, Lord, you just rang
Stan Lee's doorbell.

439
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,308
At Stan Lee's house.

440
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,877
We're about to go in and have
milk and cookies with Stan Lee.

441
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:34,013
Okay, sweetie, I don't know
if we're gonna have cookies,

442
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,214
or he's just gonna say hi,

443
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:37,083
or really what's gonna happen,
so just let me

444
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:38,985
talk, and we'll... ?

445
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:41,121
Yeah?

446
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,657
Are you Stan Lee?

447
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:47,393
Oh, damn.

448
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,494
Hi. I'm Penny.
This is my friend, Sheldon.

449
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,029
We're not friends
at the moment.

450
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,364
Depends on
how this goes.

451
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,232
Right, right. Anyway,

452
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,300
Sheldon here is a huge fan
of yours, and he was supposed

453
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,503
to meet you the other day
at the comic book store,

454
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:02,641
but he kind of ended up in jail.

455
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:03,909
I see. And you thought

456
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,678
you'd just come over
to my house uninvited?

457
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,614
You said we
<i>were</i> invited.

458
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,316
Oh, no, no, I said
I'm inviting you

459
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,218
to come with me
to Stan Lee's house.

460
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:16,322
You know,
you fan boys are unbelievable.

461
00:19:16,357 --> 00:19:17,623
Do you think
you can just

462
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:20,059
ring my doorbell
any time you want?

463
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:22,094
I mean, why don't you
just come on in

464
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:23,629
and watch the Lakers game
with me?

465
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,532
Well, I'm not much
of a sports fan,

466
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,735
but thank you.

467
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,037
I'm sorry.

468
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:33,039
He doesn't really
understand sarcasm.

469
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:35,642
Well, I'll give him something
he'll understand.

470
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,310
Joanie, call the police!

471
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,245
Nice to meet you.

472
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,018
Fantastic Four,
Daredevil,

473
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,553
Invincible Iron Man,

474
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:49,389
Happy Hogan,
Curt Connors...

475
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,191
Would you just let it go?

476
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:55,363
And worst of all,
Fin Fang Foom.

477
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,968
Hey, where've you been?

478
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:01,636
I'll tell you where I've been.

479
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:04,839
You boys may have had gelato
with Stan Lee

480
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:06,273
and gotten
autographed comics,

481
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:08,375
but I saw the inside
of his house

482
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,610
and got an autographed
application

483
00:20:10,645 --> 00:20:13,680
for a restraining order.

484
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,650
Sweet.

485
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:20,253
Plus, I get to hang out
with him again at the hearing.

486
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:24,654
This is going
to look great hanging next

487
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,723
to my restraining order
from Leonard Nimoy.
