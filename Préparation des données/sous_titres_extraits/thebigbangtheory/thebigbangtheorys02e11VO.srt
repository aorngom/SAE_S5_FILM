1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,500
Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,030
It is well established

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,100
Superman cleans his uniform

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,830
by flying into Earth's yellow sun,

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,800
which incinerates any contaminate matter

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,900
and leaves the invulnerable

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,360
Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,660
What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?

9
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,760
Like what?

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,700
I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,330
I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,200
were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,700
Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite,

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,030
the only way to destroy

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,130
a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,600
Raj, please,

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,800
let's stay serious here.

18
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,660
Superman's body is Kryptonian,

19
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,400
therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.

20
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,060
Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?

21
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,000
Superman doesn't sweat on Earth.

22
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,430
Okay,

23
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
he's invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor.

24
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,960
He miniaturizes himself, enters the city

25
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,500
where he loses his superpowers. Now,

26
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,830
before dinner, his host says,

27
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,030
"Who's up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?"

28
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,030
Superman says "Sure," works up a sweat,

29
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,660
comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained

30
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,160
with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.

31
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,300
Boo ya.

32
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,630
Superman would have taken his uniform

33
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,160
to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.

34
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,330
"Kandorian dry cl..." I give up.

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,700
You can't have a rational argument with this man.

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,460
isn't that the guy who won

37
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,100
the MacArthur genius grant last year?

38
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,030
No, not all at once.

39
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,530
Then how?

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,800
Leonard.

41
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,700
Now, Raj.

42
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,030
Now, Sheldon.

43
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,930
I didn't get a good look. Can I go again?

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,430
No.

45
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,460
It's David Underhill. So what?

46
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,600
So what?

47
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,800
His observation of high-energy positrons

48
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,500
has provided the first conclusive evidence

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,530
for the existence of galactic dark matter.

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,730
I have two words for you.

51
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,130
The first is "big," the other's "whoop."

52
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,260
It <i>is</i> a big whoop.

53
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,700
It made almost all the work

54
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,500
you've done since you've been here completely useless.

55
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,660
Did not. Did, too.

56
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,760
Did...

57
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,030
Okay, maybe  <i>some</i> of it, but...

58
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,560
Look, the guy was just in the right place,

59
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,200
at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting

60
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,760
reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.

61
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,100
In more ways than one.

62
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,430
He's a very handsome man.

63
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,900
Doesn't do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way,

64
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,200
I'm more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy.

65
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,530
Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.

66
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,830
Excuse me...

67
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,630
Are you Leonard Hofstadter?

68
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,060
Uh... yeah.

69
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,130
I'm David Underhill.

70
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,460
Uh... y-yeah.

71
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,900
Yeah, Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted

72
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,530
to set something up in the photomultiplier lab,

73
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,360
that you'd be able to give me a hand?

74
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,300
You want to work with <i>me?</i> Well,

75
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,530
if you have a little time, yeah.

76
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,030
Wow.... Y-yeah, sure.

77
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah, no problem. Uh...

78
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,460
Here's my home number.

79
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,460
Here's my cell.

80
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,460
Here's my office.

81
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,660
Here's my parents' number up in New Jersey.

82
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,530
They always know how to reach me. So... Okay.

83
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,530
Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan.

84
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,660
Thanks. I'll call you.

85
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,430
Okay.

86
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,200
Bye-bye!

87
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,160
What are you looking at?

88
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,660
You've never seen a hypocrite before?

89
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,100
Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike

90
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,560
if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper,

91
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,260
who is dominating in the ninth frame

92
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,780
with a career-best 68.

93
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,560
Hey, guys!

94
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,700
That doesn't count.

95
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,200
Do over! Do over!

96
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,700
There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.

97
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,030
There are always do-overs when my people play sports.

98
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,230
Where were you that's more important

99
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,400
than Wii bowling night?

100
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,400
Actually, I was...

101
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,430
It's a rhetorical question.

102
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,560
There <i>is</i> nothing more important

103
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,200
than Wii bowling night.

104
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,430
Come on, it's just a video game.

105
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,460
And we suck at it.

106
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,800
Nice motivational speech from the team captain.

107
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,760
Where <i>were</i> you?

108
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,400
I was working with Dave Underhill.

109
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,660
Ooh, "Dave." Sounds like Leonard's got a new BFF.

110
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,930
Actually, he's pretty cool.

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,260
I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist,

112
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,660
but it turns out he's a Black Diamond skier.

113
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,930
He collects vintage motorcycles. He plays in a rock band.

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,800
So? We're in a rock band.

115
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,800
No...

116
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,230
We play Rock Band on our X-Box.

117
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,330
Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.

118
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
He's funny, too.

119
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,560
He does this hysterical impersonation

120
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,860
of Stephen Hawking having phone sex.

121
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,800
What are you wearing?

122
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,530
That's not... He does it better.

123
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,230
Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow,

124
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,930
so I'm gonna go practice my situps.

125
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,930
Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,660
Yeah. It's officially a bro-mance.

127
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,560
Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard

128
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,930
putting up a Christmas tree?

129
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,560
No, because we don't celebrate

130
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,230
the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.

131
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,800
Saturnalia?

132
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,130
Gather round, kids,

133
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,530
it's time for Sheldon's beloved Christmas special.

134
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,930
In the pre-Christian era,

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,460
as the winter solstice approached and the plants died,

136
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,930
pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,960
as an act of sympathetic magic, intended

138
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,860
to guard the life essences of the plants until spring.

139
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,600
This custom was later appropriated

140
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,600
by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes

141
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,660
the so-called Christmas tree.

142
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,430
And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about.

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,100
Okay, well, thank you

144
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,700
for that, but I got you and Leonard

145
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,260
a few silly neighbor gifts, so I'll just

146
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,260
put them under <i>my</i> tree.

147
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,130
Wait!

148
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,160
You bought me a present?

149
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,330
Why would you do such a thing?

150
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,030
I don't know. 'Cause it's Christmas?

151
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,530
Oh, Penny. I know you think you're being generous,

152
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,430
but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity.

153
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,100
You haven't given me a gift.

154
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,630
You've given me an obligation.

155
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,900
Don't feel bad, Penny, it's a classic rookie mistake.

156
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,300
My first Hanukkah with Sheldon,

157
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,060
he yelled at me for eight nights.

158
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,530
Now, hey, it's okay.You don't have to get me anything in return.

159
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,400
Of course I do. The essence of the custom

160
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,860
is that I now have to go out and purchase for you

161
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,360
a gift of commensurate value

162
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,600
and representing the same perceived level of friendship

163
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,800
as that represented by the gift you've given me.

164
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,100
It's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.

165
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,830
Okay, you know what? Forget it.

166
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,100
I'm not giving you a present.

167
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,060
No, it's too late. I see it. That elf sticker

168
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,230
says, "To Sheldon."

169
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,060
The die has been cast.

172
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,300
I know. It's funny

173
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,660
when it's not happening to us.

174
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,330
Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.

175
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,030
No. No, I brought this on myself

176
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,560
by being such an endearing and important part of your life.

177
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,130
I'm going to need a ride to the mall.

178
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,430
It's happening to us.

179
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,760
Are you gonna make it?

180
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,960
Yeah, I guess.

181
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,160
All right.

182
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,560
Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.

183
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,100
No problem.

184
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,460
I had no idea it was so heavy.

185
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,260
The thing just fell right over on me, didn't it?

186
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,960
Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn't moving.

187
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,930
-Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay? -Oh, yeah.

188
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,430
It's just a little motorcycle accident.

189
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,300
My God, how fast were you going?

190
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,860
I don't know. It's all such a blur.

191
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,430
Good one. He couldn't even get it started.

192
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,930
Hi. Dave. Hi.

193
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,060
Penny. So it's <i>your</i> motorcycle?

194
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,860
Is it okay?

195
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,860
It's fine.

196
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,530
Lucky for the bike

197
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,760
it landed on my leg.

198
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,060
You mind giving me a hand with speed racer here?

199
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,300
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

200
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,900
So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?

201
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,100
I'm a physicist.

202
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,430
No, you're not.

203
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,230
Why is that so surprising?

204
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,760
Uh, well, it's just that the physicists I know

205
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,430
are indoorsy and pale.

206
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,760
I'm not indoorsy.

207
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,430
I just wear the appropriate sun block

208
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,660
because I don't take melanoma lightly.

209
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,900
So, are you

210
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,660
and Leonard working on an experiment together?

211
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,900
Yeah, actually we are.

212
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,430
Yeah, we're examining the radiation levels

213
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,460
of photomultiplier tubes

214
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,930
for a new dark matter detector.

215
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,030
Uh, sweetie, sweetie,

216
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,360
Dave was talking.

217
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,600
You know, I love science.

218
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,930
-Since when? -Since always.

219
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,260
Call me a geek, but I am just nuts

220
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,730
for the whole subatomic- particle thing.

221
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,460
The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.

222
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,400
Ha. Well, that's what I am--

223
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,730
queen of the nerds.

224
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,760
Well, if you like,

225
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,730
I could show you the lab we're working in.

226
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,200
We've got some cool toys, you know-- lasers and stuff.

227
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,660
You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab.

228
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,660
Since when?

229
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,500
Since always.

230
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,200
Leonard, are you okay here? Uh...

231
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,430
-Yeah. I guess. -How 'bout we go see it now?

232
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,360
Maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast,

233
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,800
We grab a little bite to eat...

234
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,500
Um... Yeah. Yeah, that sounds great.

235
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,760
Let me just get my jacket.

236
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,560
Boy, she'll do, huh?

237
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,100
Yeah, if you like that type.

238
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,200
So, you and her...?

239
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,260
No, just neighbors.

240
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,530
Really.

241
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I don't know how you live next door to that

242
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,700
without doing something about it.

243
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,900
Actually...

244
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,600
science is my lady.

245
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,100
Okay. Let's go.

246
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,100
All right.

247
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,460
See you tomorrow, Leonard.

248
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,460
See ya. 'Bye, Penny.

249
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,100
Have fun.

250
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,860
Yes?

251
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Did you forget your key?

252
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,130
I don't see anything in here a woman would want.

253
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,260
You're kidding.

254
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,530
You've got lotions and bath oils and soaps.

255
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,660
that's the estrogen hat trick.

256
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,130
What it is is a cacophonous assault

257
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,860
of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla.

258
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,260
It's as if my head were trapped in the pajamas of a sultan.

259
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,360
Sheldon, if you don't like this stuff,

260
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,530
let's just go next door and build her a bear.

261
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,300
I told you before, bears are terrifying.

262
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
Come on,

263
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,130
bath stuff. It's perfect!

264
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,030
You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff,

265
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,730
spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.

266
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,500
That presupposes Penny is tense.

267
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,830
She knows you. She's tense.

268
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,530
We all are. Buy a basket!

269
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,030
Excuse me, we're ready.

270
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,560
No, we're not.

271
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,530
Let's say for a moment that I accept

272
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,330
the bath item gift hypothesis,

273
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
I now lay the following conundrum at your feet:

274
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,830
Which size?

275
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,760
This one. Let's go.

276
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,360
You put no thought into that.

277
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,800
I'm sorry. Uh... this one.

278
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,700
Let's go!

279
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,700
I have insufficient data to proceed.

280
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,100
Excuse me, miss?

281
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,330
Yes?

282
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,100
If I were to give you this gift basket,

283
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,630
based on that action alone and no other data,

284
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,200
infer and describe the hypothetical relationship

285
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,400
that exists between us.

286
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,230
Excuse me?

287
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,360
Here.

288
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,600
Now, are we friends?

289
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,430
Colleagues? Lovers?

290
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,560
Are you my grandmother?

291
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,260
I don't understand what you're talking about

292
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,400
and you're making me a little uncomfortable.

293
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,200
See? Sounds just like you and Penny.

294
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,430
We'll take it.

295
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,500
Hey, Leonard. Come, join us.

296
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,300
Oh, hey, Dave.

297
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,560
And Penny, what a surprise.

298
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,930
Hey, Leonard.

299
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,160
Dave was just showing me around the university.

300
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,500
You know, this place

301
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,660
is unbelievable!

302
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,960
Yeah, I know. I've been offering

303
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,500
to show you around for a year and a half.

304
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,330
You always said you had yoga.

305
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,060
I never said that.

306
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,000
Maybe I heard you wrong.

307
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,500
A lot of words sound like "yoga."

308
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,830
This is an amazing woman, Leonard.

309
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,030
She has a curious and agile mind,

310
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,100
not to mention being curious and agile in other respects.

311
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,100
Oh, shut up!

312
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,760
Yes, please shut up.

313
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,330
So, um, Dave,

314
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,700
don't you think you and I should get back to the lab?

315
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,100
You know, that dark matter isn't going to detect itself.

316
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,230
Actually, I was thinking about taking the afternoon off

317
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,160
so I could work on another experiment with Penny.

318
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,000
Really? We're going to do an experiment?

319
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,030
Uh-huh. We're going to explore the effects of tequila shots

320
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,530
on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.

321
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,860
It's not an experiment!

322
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,860
You saw what happened last night.

323
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,260
You ready to go? Yeah.

324
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,500
Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?

325
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,760
Yeah, why not?

326
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,930
You can't do any worse than Leonard.

327
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,300
That's funny.

328
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,260
By the way, my leg is killing me.

329
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,630
Thanks for asking.

330
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,000
Mmm, great news, Leonard.

331
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,260
I've solved my Penny gift dilemma.

332
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,560
Yippee.

333
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,630
You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate,

334
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,630
but I have devised a foolproof plan.

335
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,560
See, I will open her gift to me first

336
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,000
and then excuse myself,

337
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,830
feigning digestive distress.

338
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,830
Then I'll look up the price of her gift online,

339
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,930
choose the basket closest to that value,

340
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,530
give it to her

341
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,330
and then I'll return the others for a full refund.

342
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,730
Brilliant.

343
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,260
It is, isn't it?

344
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,900
Is it okay if I hide them in your room?

345
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,900
The smell makes me nauseated.

346
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,300
Do whatever you want.

347
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,230
Thank you, that's very gracious.

348
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,030
Gentlemen.

349
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,530
Why couldn't you have just done what Leonard did

350
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,530
and get Penny a new boyfriend?

351
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,260
My leg is killing me.

352
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,630
Thanks for asking.

353
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,500
Okay, I have just one question for you.

354
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,300
While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us,

355
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,700
you said that you didn't want

356
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
to go out with me because I was too smart for you!

357
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,060
Well, news flash, lady

358
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,530
David Underhill is ten times smarter than me!

359
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,830
You'd have to drive a railroad spike into his brain

360
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,160
for me to beat him at checkers!

361
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,430
Next to him,

362
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,560
I'm like one of those sign-language gorillas

363
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,830
who knows how to ask for grapes!

364
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,860
So, my question is...

365
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,900
What's up with that?!

366
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,330
Why are you yelling at me?

367
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,430
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

368
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,060
Never mind, we're cool.

369
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,530
Dave is not smarter than you.

370
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,830
He's an idiot.

371
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,160
Really? Why would you say that?

372
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,630
Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife

373
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,060
off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos

374
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,900
of his girlfriend.

375
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,460
He tried to take nude photos of you?

376
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,400
That's what you took from that?!

377
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,360
The guy is married!

378
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,760
Oh, yeah.

379
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,460
I'm so-- Oh, that's terrible.

380
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,160
And you, if you are so okay

381
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,330
with the way things are between us,

382
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,700
why are you so jealous?

383
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,030
Well, uh...

384
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,360
The important thing is he's married and that's terrible!

385
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,930
Nice save, genius.

386
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,400
Eggnog?

387
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,730
Lactose.

388
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,760
It's just rum.

389
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,200
It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.

390
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,900
Smooth.

391
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,300
Smoother than you.

392
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,960
Come on, it's Christmas, just give me this one.

393
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,860
Okay, Merry Christmas.

394
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
By the way, my leg is killing me.

395
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,200
Thanks for asking.

396
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,800
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

397
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,900
How's your leg?

398
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,230
Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.

399
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,200
Ah, good, Penny, you're here to exchange gifts.

400
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,760
You'll be pleased to know

401
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,130
I'm prepared for whatever you have to offer.

402
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,730
Okay, here.

403
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,130
I should note I'm having some digestive distress,

404
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:46,730
so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don't be alarmed.

405
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,200
Oh, a napkin.

406
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,130
Turn it over.

407
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,160
"To Sheldon,

408
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,600
"live long and prosper.

409
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,900
Leonard Nimoy."

410
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,860
Yeah, he came into the restaurant.

411
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,000
Sorry the napkin's dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.

412
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!

413
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,100
Well...

414
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,760
Yeah, yeah. I guess.

415
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,730
But look, he signed it.

416
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,660
Do you realize what this means?!

417
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,500
All I need is a healthy ovum

418
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,830
and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!

419
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,030
Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.

420
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,200
Be right back.

421
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,560
Here. Open it.

422
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:16,030
Oh, a gift cerficate for motorcycle lessons.

423
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,930
Very thoughtful.

424
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,960
Yeah, and I checked.

425
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,400
Not letting the bike fall on you

426
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,430
while standing still is lesson one.

427
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,900
Oh, then, I think you'll appreciate what I got you.

428
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Okay.

429
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,500
"101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids."

430
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,260
You know, 'cause you're so into science.

431
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,400
Sheldon! What did you do?!

432
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,560
I know!

433
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,430
It's not enough, is it?

434
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,600
Here.

435
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,160
Leonard, look! Sheldon's hugging me.

436
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,630
It's a Saturnalia miracle.
