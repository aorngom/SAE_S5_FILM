1
00:00:02,849 --> 00:00:05,285
I cannot believe you made
up your own game.

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,799
"Research Lab" is more than a game.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,529
It's like the slogan says:

4
00:00:10,654 --> 00:00:13,627
"The physics is theoretical,
but the fun is real."

5
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:17,642
We must not be playing it right.

6
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:23,030
All right, five.
One, two, three, four, five.

7
00:00:23,868 --> 00:00:27,068
Look at that. My Department
of Defense research grant is renewed.

8
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:29,147
Great roll!

9
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:32,150
Now you can demolish
your Soviet-style cyclotron

10
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:34,347
and build the large Hadron Collider.

11
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:39,205
You're a natural at this.

12
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:42,088
And as the first beta testers,
you two'll have quite the edge

13
00:00:42,213 --> 00:00:44,501
when we play with Wolowitz
and Koothrappali on Sunday.

14
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,048
I don't think we can play on Sunday.

15
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:50,363
Why not?

16
00:00:50,698 --> 00:00:53,344
Because of the reasons
that Penny will now tell you.

17
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:57,014
I have to pick up
my friend Justin from the airport.

18
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,558
She has to pick up
her friend Justin at the airport.

19
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,894
And I can't play
'cause I'm going with her... right?

20
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:04,671
If you want.
There may not be room.

21
00:01:04,796 --> 00:01:07,483
He's got a lot of stuff...
like guitars and amplifiers...

22
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:11,653
- Wait. What are you talking about?
- My friend Justin.

23
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,073
Pay attention.
That's why she can't play on Sunday.

24
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:16,408
- Who is this Justin?
- Your turn.

25
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:19,078
- I told you about him.
- No, you didn't.

26
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:22,976
My friend from Omaha, plays the guitar,
he's coming to LA looking for work,

27
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:25,209
I told him he could crash
on my couch for a few weeks.

28
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:28,693
Come on... if you roll a six, Penny
dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown.

29
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:33,259
See what I mean
when I say the fun is real?

30
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,971
Hang on. Some guy is going
to be sleeping on your couch?

31
00:01:37,422 --> 00:01:39,574
He's not "some guy." He's my friend.

32
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:42,852
So by "friend,"
do you mean "friend friend,"

33
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:45,879
"gay friend," or "ex-boyfriend
who you're now platonic with

34
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:48,315
"but still might have a thing
for you friend"?

35
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:51,110
Well, he's definitely not gay.

36
00:01:51,793 --> 00:01:55,446
A definitely not gay musician
sleeping on my girlfriend's couch.

37
00:01:58,382 --> 00:02:00,453
We went out a little bit,
a long time ago.

38
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:02,538
But we were never like "going out."

39
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,953
Okay, not to be pedantic,
but last I checked

40
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:07,460
"went out" was in fact the past
tense of "going out"...

41
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,754
which I think we all know
is a popular euphemism

42
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,556
for "saw each other naked."

43
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:14,808
I'll just roll for you.

44
00:02:16,272 --> 00:02:18,345
Do you have a problem
with Justin staying with me?

45
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:19,972
What was your first clue?

46
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:22,524
Industrial accident.

47
00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:25,978
You know what?
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

48
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,398
I'm not talking to you like that!
I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic!

49
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,678
"You accidentally stare
at a helium-argon laser.

50
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:33,591
"Lose one turn and a retina."

51
00:02:34,724 --> 00:02:36,655
How is that not talking
to me like I'm an idiot?

52
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,492
It's my friend, it's my couch,
and it's my freakin' life!

53
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:40,971
It's also your roll.

54
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:43,329
You know what?
It is your life.

55
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,243
If you want to have some stupid
guitarist stay on your couch, then fine!

56
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:50,127
Why don't you just rent some bunk beds
and invite The Black Eyed Peas?!

57
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,123
If I want to invite
the entire lineup of Lollapalooza

58
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:55,716
to sleep in my apartment, I will,
and it's none of your business!

59
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:58,260
Are you listening to yourself?
Do you know how childish you sound?

60
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,930
Now I'm a child?
Well, at least I'm not an idiot anymore!

61
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:02,639
The two aren't mutually exclusive!

62
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:04,307
You are such a...

63
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:06,351
What the hell is he doing?!

64
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:09,145
He's drowning us out.
He doesn't like fighting.

65
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:11,198
Just stop!
Look, the fight is over!

66
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:12,941
And FYI,

67
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:15,735
you never even heard
of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!

68
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:17,209
I heard of 'em!

69
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:20,738
Didn't know they were a band.

70
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:24,994
Sheldon, she's gone.
You can turn off the blender.

71
00:03:31,553 --> 00:03:34,426
Has your relationship reached
its inevitable ugly end?

72
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,092
No, we just had a little spat.

73
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,737
Look on the bright side.

74
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:42,739
As the result of Penny's forfeit,

75
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:46,329
you have become the world's
first winner of "Research Lab."

76
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,103
Would you like
a commemorative snow cone?

77
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,400
Episode 307:
The Guitarist Amplification

78
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,137
Sync: Jess, Linwelin, Loky

79
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,755
www.subbercafe.fr

80
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,808
I don't get
how she can just announce

81
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:23,219
that an old boyfriend is going
to be sleeping on her couch.

82
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:25,848
I thought of a game
we can play in the car.

83
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,349
I don't want to play a game.

84
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,644
It's called "Scientists."
Now, I will name three scientists,

85
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,212
then you will put them in order

86
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:34,689
of the size of their contribution
to their respective fields.

87
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,827
To make this game
even more compelling,

88
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:40,111
you must consider only the contribution
of the man to the field,

89
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,479
not the validity
of the field itself.

90
00:04:42,604 --> 00:04:44,981
For example:
Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan

91
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:48,151
made a greater contribution
to the discredited field of alchemy

92
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:50,503
than Halbert Vanderplatt
made to neurobiology.

93
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:52,320
Okay, ready to have some fun?

94
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:56,209
An old boyfriend
who's definitely not gay.

95
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:59,089
That's what a guy likes
to hear... "definitely."

96
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,038
All right, I'll start
with an easy one:

97
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:05,009
Isaac Newton, Madame Curie
and Niels Bohr.

98
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:08,306
And then I say one little thing
and I end up being the bad guy!

99
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,643
Hint: Madame Curie had
her husband to help her.

100
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:13,226
What am I supposed to say?

101
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:15,647
"Sure, Penny, I'm cool
with your old boyfriend

102
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,130
sleeping in your apartment."

103
00:05:17,614 --> 00:05:19,317
"It doesn't
matter if you're cool or not

104
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,569
"because I'm Penny and I'm pretty
and I can do whatever the hell I want!"

105
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,806
"You think you're doing me a favor
by being in a relationship with me!"

106
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:29,786
"I'm doing you a favor just by
being in the same room as you!"

107
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:31,301
Leonard! Stop the car!

108
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:34,026
What?

109
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:36,459
I can't listen to the
two of you fight anymore.

110
00:05:41,822 --> 00:05:44,457
- Come on, we're late.
- Calm down. We'll make the movie.

111
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:47,126
I believe my alarm is appropriate,
given the situation.

112
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:48,654
The movie starts in 17 minutes.

113
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:51,372
We'll need to make all the lights
on Colorado Boulevard,

114
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:54,102
plus skip the concession stand,
and preshow urination.

115
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:59,042
Dude, I wish you had said something
before I pounded that last Red Bull.

116
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:01,965
Go, go, Power Rangers, go!

117
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:08,825
We're going to the movies.

118
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:09,993
No, we're not.

119
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:14,416
We're standing in the hallway,
suffering through an awkward encounter.

120
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:16,874
Hang on.

121
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:19,719
They're showing a new digital
print of <i>Time Bandits</i>.

122
00:06:19,844 --> 00:06:22,463
- You wouldn't want to come, would you?
- Not really, no.

123
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,832
Invitation pointlessly offered,
invitation declined as expected,

124
00:06:25,957 --> 00:06:28,646
everyone's civil, nobody's fighting.
Have a nice evening.

125
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:32,627
Just give us a minute.

126
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,551
Take all the time you need.

127
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:41,108
So, are we going to talk
about last night?

128
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:42,985
Are you ready to apologize?

129
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,071
Wrong answer.
But thank you for playing.

130
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:49,275
Come on.
This is stupid.

131
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,410
There it is again!
You think I'm stupid!

132
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,288
There's a difference between
being stupid and acting stupid!

133
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,416
Well, there's a difference between
being a jerk and being an ass!

134
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,066
No, there isn't!
They're synonyms!

135
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,180
Well, that was rather unpleasant.

136
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:09,814
Yeah, I don't think I need
my preshow urination anymore.

137
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,886
When that woman moved in 3 years ago,
I told you not to talk to her,

138
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:16,935
and now, we're going
to be late for the movies.

139
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:24,464
Hey! Look! <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i> 183.

140
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:25,653
Got it.

141
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,217
Remember this one?
Spider-Man loses a big fight

142
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:31,658
and then his girlfriend
breaks up with him.

143
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:38,665
Want me to get it for you?
It'll help take your mind off things.

144
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,044
- Hey, guys. What's going on?
- We need to kill a couple hours

145
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,990
till the next showing
of <i>Time Bandits</i>.

146
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,882
No problem, I was thinking
of closing early and going home, but...

147
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:50,539
let's face it, that's just
a slightly smaller lonely room

148
00:07:50,664 --> 00:07:52,302
filled with comic books.

149
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:55,092
Thanks, Stuart.

150
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:59,028
Let me ask you something.
Do you think it's okay for Penny

151
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:01,021
to have an ex-boyfriend sleep
on her couch?

152
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,496
- She's obviously way out of line.
- Thank you!

153
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,529
But if she dumps you, she'll have
a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning

154
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:09,863
and you'll have a new girlfriend
when you figure out how to build one.

155
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:15,035
So the only question is:
how long until you fold?

156
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,905
I am not going to fold.

157
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,482
Well, excuse me, I don't think
Penny's out of line at all.

158
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:20,932
You don't own her.

159
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:22,780
It's like my girl Beyoncé says:

160
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:25,401
"If you like it,
you shoulda put a ring on it."

161
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,581
At the very least, when she found out
Leonard was upset about it,

162
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:32,094
she should've backed off.

163
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:35,178
Like when a guy's upset cause his friend
agreed to take a cooking class with him

164
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:38,892
and then doesn't show up because
he's doing a juice fast with his mother?

165
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:41,446
I didn't know
you were upset about that.

166
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,476
Really! Did you miss all
the subtle indicators,

167
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:45,566
like me saying,
"Howard, I am upset."

168
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:48,277
- Okay, sorry.
- Maybe it means something different.

169
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,321
Back in India, it means
you're upset with a guy named Howard!

170
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,219
- I said I'm sorry.
- Sorry doesn't make up for the fact

171
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:56,783
that I had to make chicken
and rice with this vegan guy.

172
00:08:56,908 --> 00:08:59,095
Do you know
what vegan chicken and rice is?

173
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,220
Rice!

174
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,785
Well, you think I was having fun,

175
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,945
sitting around all night
listening to my mother say,

176
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,622
"Have you ever peed so much
in your life?"

177
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,033
My God, you are such a mama's boy.

178
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:14,761
- Hey, don't bring my mother into this!
- You brought your mother into this!

179
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,305
Stop it, both of you!

180
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,471
All this fighting, I might as well
be back with my parents!

181
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:22,285
"Damn it, George, I told you if you
didn't quit drinkin' I'd leave you!"

182
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,067
"I guess that makes you a liar.

183
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:26,106
"Cause I'm drunk as hell
and you're still here!"

184
00:09:26,596 --> 00:09:28,858
"Stop yelling!
You're making Sheldon cry!"

185
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:30,722
"I'll tell you
what's making Sheldon cry!

186
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:32,571
"That I let you name him Sheldon!"

187
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:41,759
Boy, what got him so upset?

188
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,600
Oh, sure, you can tell
when Sheldon's upset.

189
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:55,552
Thank you very much.
Come back soon.

190
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:58,661
With the other half of my tip.

191
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,769
Hey, Sheldon.
What are you doing here?

192
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,980
This is a restaurant.
It's lunchtime.

193
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,940
I would think, as a waitress,
you'd be familiar with the paradigm.

194
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:10,790
Is Leonard coming?

195
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,821
I believe he is waiting for you to come
crawling back to him and apologize.

196
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:17,720
- That's not gonna happen.
- I assumed that would be your attitude.

197
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:19,910
- Hence, my true purpose in coming here.
- Which is?

198
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,621
I want you to crawl back to him
and apologize.

199
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:24,174
I'm busy.

200
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:25,656
Excuse me, miss.

201
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:27,496
I'd like to order lunch.

202
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:34,383
- Fine. What do you want?
- I have a few questions.

203
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,427
First, I notice that you offer
soup and a half-sandwich?

204
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:41,109
Where exactly does
the half-sandwich come from?

205
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,642
Are you giving me half
of someone else's sandwich,

206
00:10:44,358 --> 00:10:47,493
or do I have to wait for someone else
to order the other half?

207
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,981
No, Sheldon,
they just make a half-sandwich.

208
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,858
You can't make a half-sandwich.

209
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,529
If it's not half of a whole sandwich,
it's just a small sandwich.

210
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:59,116
Fine, it's soup and a small sandwich.
Is that what you want?

211
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,383
Of course not. I'll have my usual.

212
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:03,116
Great.

213
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:05,205
Aren't you going to ask me
if I want a beverage?

214
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:06,980
Don't you usually get lemonade?

215
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:08,292
Do you want lemonade?

216
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,919
- Anything else?
- I want you to apologize to Leonard.

217
00:11:12,377 --> 00:11:14,709
I am not going to apologize.
I've done nothing wrong.

218
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:16,734
- He is completely overreacting.
- Irrelevant.

219
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:20,045
The disruption in your relationship
is making my life intolerable.

220
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,140
Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon,
but this really isn't about you.

221
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,360
I don't follow.

222
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:29,438
Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there.
Look, Sheldon, I have to go.

223
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:33,275
All right, let's assume, <i>ad argumentum</i>,
that in this case, Leonard is wrong.

224
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,818
Leonard is wrong.

225
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,110
Considering the number of transgressions
you've committed that he's overlooked,

226
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:40,699
don't you think that, just this once,
you could return the favor?

227
00:11:41,397 --> 00:11:42,909
I'm coming. Good-bye, Sheldon.

228
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:50,322
What do you mean,
transgressions I've committed?

229
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:53,962
Were you under the impression
Leonard has no complaints about you?

230
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,262
Like what?!

231
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:57,620
I see you, you're making
a little check sign in the air.

232
00:11:57,745 --> 00:11:59,079
Just hold your horses.

233
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:02,888
- What does Leonard complain about?
- Your driving.

234
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,870
The plethora
of stuffed animals on your bed

235
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:07,350
that stare at him
during your amorous activities.

236
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:11,229
Your constant tardiness,
your singing.

237
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,274
- My singing?
- That's actually from my list.

238
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,567
But Leonard would be a fool
if he didn't agree with it.

239
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:19,035
If Leonard has so many problems with me,
why hasn't he just said so?

240
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,656
Because, according to him,
you're oversensitive and have a temper.

241
00:12:22,388 --> 00:12:24,242
Oh, really?
Well, then, do me a favor

242
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,660
and tell Leonard
that he can drop dead!

243
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,459
And she wonders
why she's constantly undertipped.

244
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:40,297
Good, you're home.

245
00:12:40,422 --> 00:12:42,191
- I need you to do me a favor.
- Sure.

246
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:43,916
Go apologize to Penny.

247
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:46,892
- What?!
- Right now would be good.

248
00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:50,602
Although, a few minutes ago
would have been better.

249
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:55,399
Seems you don't like my stuffed animals,
my driving or my punctuality.

250
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,734
What? Who would tell you
something like that?

251
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,070
Why would you tell her
something like that?

252
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,739
It doesn't matter why he told me.
It's true, isn't it?

253
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:05,695
Yeah, it's true,
but I can live with that stuff.

254
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,005
What I can't live with is
you casually informing me

255
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,081
that a guy's staying in your apartment
without even asking me first!

256
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:14,511
That isn't your problem!
Your problem is you don't trust me!

257
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,755
Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say
that I don't trust Penny?

258
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:20,882
Sheldon?
Where did he go?

259
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:24,085
Your yelling must have
freaked him out again.

260
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,097
Where are you going?! You walk away
in the middle of an argument?!

261
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,284
I'm gonna find your roommate
before he hurts himself

262
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,934
trying to cross the street!

263
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:33,106
Why didn't you say so?

264
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:35,217
Now I need your permission
for that, too?!

265
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:37,068
I can't read your mind, Penny!

266
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:39,714
Really? Why not?
You're so smart, and I'm so dumb!

267
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:48,883
Stop knocking!
It's open!

268
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:51,997
Tell my parents that
our dark matter research

269
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,410
is at a critical juncture,

270
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,458
and I can't come home
for my cousin wedding.

271
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,189
<i>Ask our son what we're supposed to say
to Mr. and Mrs. Cheldry,</i>

272
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:01,265
<i>whose daughter, Lakshmi
is flying in from London,</i>

273
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,066
<i>for the sole purpose of meeting him.</i>

274
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,010
I didn't ask you
to set me up with her.

275
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,933
<i>- You should be thanking us!
- Yes.</i>

276
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:09,139
<i>Lakshmi just got
her stomach stapled.</i>

277
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,608
<i>You have an opportunity
to get in good with her</i>

278
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:15,103
<i>before she loses weight,
and her self-esteem goes up.</i>

279
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,563
I don't care!

280
00:14:16,893 --> 00:14:19,191
And why don't you think I can find
a woman for myself?

281
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:22,131
<i>Because you're 27, and the closest thing
we have to a daughter-in-law</i>

282
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:24,056
<i>is that Jewish boy Howard.</i>

283
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:27,375
That is completely below the belt.

284
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Sheldon, tell my parents
that Howard and I are just friends.

285
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:34,877
Howard and I are just friends!

286
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:40,791
Fine. I'll come home
for Sanjay's wedding.

287
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,182
What are you doing?
He's not a lost dog.

288
00:14:52,878 --> 00:14:54,572
Why don't you just let me find him

289
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:56,684
while you sit there
hitting your imaginary brake?

290
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:01,144
The brake might be imaginary,
but that stop sign you just ran wasn't.

291
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:02,316
What stop sign?

292
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:04,191
Eyes on the road.
Eyes on the road!

293
00:15:14,277 --> 00:15:17,798
<i>Howard, answer the door!
I'm busy!</i>

294
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:20,805
<i>I'm busy, too!
You answer it.</i>

295
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,338
<i>I can't! I'm on the toilet!</i>

296
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,273
<i>For God's sake,
I don't need to hear that!</i>

297
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:28,448
<i>Can't you just say, "I'm busy"?</i>

298
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:32,264
<i>I said I'm busy,
but that wasn't good enough for you!</i>

299
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:34,936
<i>I hope it's one of those
home invasion deals,</i>

300
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,658
<i>and they shoot me in the head!</i>

301
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:41,156
<i>Well, if it's a home invader,
don't tell them I'm on the toilet!</i>

302
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:47,299
There's no one there.

303
00:15:47,764 --> 00:15:49,910
<i>You're hearing things,
you crazy old lady!</i>

304
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:55,874
Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,707
Yeah, he's over in
the graphic novel section.

306
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,502
Built himself a little nest.

307
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:04,285
Thank you.

308
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,883
- Is everything okay?
- What do you mean?

309
00:16:09,438 --> 00:16:11,511
Sheldon told me
you and Leonard were having a fight?

310
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,873
Yeah, kind of.
It's no big thing.

311
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:15,998
Good, good.

312
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:18,138
I love you.

313
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,355
I'm not leaving
until you talk to me.

314
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,046
- What's going on?
- It's a little hard to explain.

315
00:16:25,171 --> 00:16:28,008
He does this thing where he pretends
he's in an alternate dimension

316
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:30,261
that occupies the
same physical space we're in,

317
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:32,136
but he can't perceive us.

318
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:36,723
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm just ignoring you.

319
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:41,496
Come on, Sheldon, let's go home.
Look, we're done fighting.

320
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,075
I've heard that before.

321
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,559
But then, the next thing you know,
I'm hiding in my bedroom,

322
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:47,563
blaring a Richard Feynman lecture

323
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:49,761
while my mom is shouting
that Jesus would forgive her

324
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:52,081
if she put ground glass
in my dad's meatloaf.

325
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:57,346
And my dad's on the roof skeet-shooting
her Franklin Mint collectible plates.

326
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:02,270
There's going to be no more shouting
and no skeet-shooting.

327
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,315
Really?
Where's your friend Justin gonna sleep?

328
00:17:06,243 --> 00:17:07,915
Yeah... where's he gonna sleep?

329
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,944
Oh, my God, would you let this go?!

330
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,312
I'd let it go.

331
00:17:13,514 --> 00:17:14,682
Why should I let it go?

332
00:17:14,807 --> 00:17:16,993
Why don't you just tell the guy
to find another place?!

333
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,413
Oh, for God's sakes.

334
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:24,621
So, you have childhood issues.

335
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:26,590
We all have childhood issues.

336
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:29,297
At some point, you just need
to grow up and get past them.

337
00:17:29,577 --> 00:17:30,590
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>

338
00:17:31,922 --> 00:17:33,635
Will you just let me
handle this, please?

339
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,569
Please, try and understand.

340
00:17:45,694 --> 00:17:49,150
Leonard and I are in a relationship,
and occasionally, we're going to fight.

341
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,051
But no matter what happens between us,
we will always love you.

342
00:17:55,622 --> 00:17:56,825
Right, Leonard?

343
00:17:57,565 --> 00:17:59,165
Always is a long time.

344
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,770
Sure. Always.

345
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:06,696
How about we buy you this robot,
and then we all go home?

346
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:09,984
I want that one.

347
00:18:11,227 --> 00:18:12,590
Okay, you can have that one.

348
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:15,483
Come on, he's just going
to play with it twice,

349
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:18,530
and then it'll end up in his closet
with all the other junk.

350
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,015
Buy him the robot.

351
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,937
Can I get this comic book, too?

352
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,271
Yes, you can.

353
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,611
We meet again.

354
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:44,030
What did Justin say
when you told him

355
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:45,801
he couldn't sleep on your couch?

356
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:46,980
He's a musician.

357
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:49,516
He'll sleep in his own vomit,
if he has to.

358
00:18:58,827 --> 00:19:02,416
I should have asked for much more
than a comic book and a robot.
