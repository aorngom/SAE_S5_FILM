1
00:00:01,882 --> 00:00:04,756
Worst. Renaissance. Fair. Ever.

2
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:08,808
Please let it go, Sheldon.

3
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:11,890
It was rife
with historical inaccuracies.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,667
For example, the tavern girl
serving flagons of mead.

5
00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:16,964
Her costume
was obviously Germanic.

6
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,697
But in 1487,

7
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:21,399
the Bavarian purity laws,
or <i>Reinheitsgebot</i>,

8
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:24,023
severely limited
the availability of mead.

9
00:00:24,143 --> 00:00:26,433
At best, they would have had
some sort of spiced wine.

10
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:28,633
- You're nitpicking.
- Oh, really?

11
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:31,242
Well, here's another nit for you:
the flagons

12
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:33,868
would not have been made
of polypropylene.

13
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:37,234
Renaissance fairs
aren't about historical accuracy.

14
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:40,076
They're about taking chubby girls
who work at Kinko's

15
00:00:40,196 --> 00:00:42,026
and lacing them up
in corsets so tight

16
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:44,524
their bosom jumps out
and says, "Howdy."

17
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:48,542
Bosoms would not have said
"howdy" in the 15th century.

18
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:51,054
If anything,
they would've said, "Huzzah."

19
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:53,303
I don't care
what the bosoms say.

20
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:55,880
I just want to be part
of the conversation.

21
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:57,913
Hi, guys.

22
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:00,369
Looks like you've been
to the renaissance fair...

23
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:01,493
I'm hoping.

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,057
Renaissance fair? More of a medieval,
slash, Age of Enlightenment,

25
00:01:06,177 --> 00:01:08,751
slash, any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece
fair.

26
00:01:09,898 --> 00:01:12,199
Okay, fine, whatever.
This is my friend Eric.

27
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:13,867
- Hello.
- Hey.

28
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:19,827
So, yeah, good to see you.

29
00:01:21,596 --> 00:01:23,044
It's good to see you, too.

30
00:01:24,662 --> 00:01:26,917
We should probably go.
Bye, guys.

31
00:01:27,927 --> 00:01:29,162
I like your hat.

32
00:01:30,726 --> 00:01:32,237
Thanks, my mom made it.

33
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,424
Penny with a new guy,
<i>très</i> awkward.

34
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,491
It wasn't awkward.

35
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,653
It wasn't fun.

36
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:45,991
Besides, what's the big deal?

37
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:49,260
We dated, we stopped dating,
and now we're both moving on.

38
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,019
By moving on, do you mean
she's going out with other men

39
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:55,634
and you spent the afternoon
making 15th-century soap with Wolowitz?

40
00:01:56,778 --> 00:02:00,180
That was not 15th century soap.
My God, those people need to learn

41
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,710
you can't just put "ye olde"
in front of anything you want

42
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,455
and expect to get away with it.

43
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:07,582
Can we please just go in?
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.

44
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:11,926
You're wearing modern underwear?

45
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:13,997
Relatively modern.

46
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:16,930
What are you wearing?

47
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:20,386
I fashioned historically accurate
undergarments out of linen.

48
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:22,511
You bought linen?

49
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:25,651
Don't be silly...
I borrowed one of your pillowcases.

50
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:29,466
Borrowed?

51
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,293

52
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:55,345
I'm happy that Penny's moving on.

53
00:02:55,505 --> 00:02:57,440
It gives me the freedom
to move on myself.

54
00:02:57,671 --> 00:03:00,226
Are you saying
that you've been holding back?

55
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,969
Of course.
Out of respect.

56
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,642
So, how do you explain
the ten years before Penny?

57
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,187
Who were you respecting then?

58
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,381
Well, I've dated plenty of women.

59
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,335
There was Joyce Kim...

60
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:17,861
Leslie Winkle...

61
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:22,812
Notify the editors
of the Oxford English Dictionary.

62
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:25,658
The word "plenty" has been
redefined to mean "two."

63
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:30,147
What about that girl
last year at Comic-Con?

64
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:31,789
- Doesn't count.
- Why not?

65
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:35,133
What happens in costume
at Comic-Con stays at Comic-Con.

66
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:38,317
You're saying that
because of what happened to you.

67
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:40,924
- What happened to you?
- Nothing happened to me.

68
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:42,929
It wasn't your fault.

69
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,596
He was dressed as a green
Orion slave girl.

70
00:03:47,121 --> 00:03:48,333
How did we get on me?!

71
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:50,359
We were mocking Leonard
for not moving on.

72
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,553
Dude, you have totally not moved on.

73
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:53,991
Yes, I have.

74
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:56,940
It's just a matter of actually
making a date with someone.

75
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,276
Like who?

76
00:03:58,564 --> 00:04:00,497
Well... there's Joyce Kim.

77
00:04:01,122 --> 00:04:03,886
But she defected
back to North Korea, so...

78
00:04:05,182 --> 00:04:07,492
it's a little
geographically undesirable.

79
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,511
- What about Leslie Winkle?
- Oh, no.

80
00:04:11,695 --> 00:04:14,086
- Why?
- Her research methodology is sloppy,

81
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:16,850
she's unjustifiably arrogant
about loop quantum gravity,

82
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,170
and to make matters worse,
she's often mean to me.

83
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:23,216
- I think she's smoking hot.
- I'd hit that.

84
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:27,408
You'd hit particulate soil
in a colloidal suspension.

85
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:30,431
Mud.

86
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:34,940
I like Leslie, but she's not interested
in dating

87
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,766
as much as using men
as tools for stress release.

88
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:39,591
Yeah, so? Be a tool.

89
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:44,404
Go get yourself a little rebound
"stress release."

90
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:46,883
Technically, it would only
be rebound if he and Penny

91
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:48,897
had actually engaged
in physical intimacy.

92
00:04:49,017 --> 00:04:51,532
Like you and Richard the slave girl?

93
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:56,171
I bought him dinner
and we kissed once! That was it.

94
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,645
And he told me
his name was Kimberly.

95
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:06,958
You know how I know
we're not in the matrix?

96
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:12,443
How?

97
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:15,632
If we were,
the food would be better.

98
00:05:17,603 --> 00:05:18,669
Hey, Leonard.

99
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:20,559
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hey, dummy.

100
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,075
Hello, to you...

101
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:25,270
insufficiently intelligent person.

102
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:28,531
Ooh, rush me to the burn unit.

103
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:34,209
Do you have a second?
I need to ask you something.

104
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:36,584
- Sure.
- If you'll excuse me,

105
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:38,352
I'm going to go do work

106
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:41,970
that promises significant results,
as opposed to what you do...

107
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:43,848
which does not.

108
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:47,038
Yeah, you heard me.

109
00:06:01,764 --> 00:06:04,761
So, I heard your relationship
with Penny crashed to the ground

110
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:07,537
like blue ice falling out
of an airplane lavatory.

111
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:09,819
Where did you hear that?

112
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:12,156
Actually, I read it.
Wolowitz texted me.

113
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,828
"Like blue ice falling out
of an airplane lavatory," yeah.

114
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:20,021
I thought it was a pretty good one.
I gave him an LOL.

115
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,105
Anyway, it got me thinking.
Now that you're unattached,

116
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:26,723
maybe we can revisit
our previous attachment.

117
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,824
Are you suggesting another bout
of stress release?

118
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:33,083
No, I'm all done with casual sex.
From now on, I'm fully committed

119
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:35,063
to the traditional
relationship paradigm.

120
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:37,228
- Really? What changed?
- It's hard to say.

121
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:39,312
I guess there's a time
in every woman's life

122
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,475
when she gets tired
of waking up on a strange futon

123
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:43,421
with a bunch of people
she doesn't know.

124
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:47,548
Yeah, I can see how that would--
a bunch of people?

125
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:50,868
Anyway, I figure it's time
to slow things down and,

126
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,783
who better to slow things down
with than you?

127
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:56,009
I'm flattered.

128
00:06:57,964 --> 00:06:58,964
So,

129
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:00,669
how do you suggest we proceed?

130
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:03,104
Your place, we'll order Chinese,
you'll rent a movie--

131
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:05,967
artsy, but accessible--
then light petting, no coitus.

132
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:09,101
Sounds fun.

133
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:13,527
I'll leave the details up to you.
It's better if you assume the male role.

134
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:17,765
Thank you, that's very thoughtful.

135
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:19,412
Great.

136
00:07:20,363 --> 00:07:21,363
Call me.

137
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,155
Great news.
My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.

138
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:36,276
- Terrific.
- You know what this means, don't you?

139
00:07:36,396 --> 00:07:39,730
Break out the Red Bull,
it's time to rock Mario, old school.

140
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:44,711
- I kind of have other plans tonight.
- But it's Friday.

141
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,488
Friday's always vintage game night.

142
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:48,636
Look, Mom included the memory card.

143
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:50,787
We can pick up right
where I left off in 1999

144
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:52,737
when I had pernicious anemia.

145
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:55,144
The thing is, someone's coming over.

146
00:07:55,304 --> 00:07:58,584
No problem. I have three controllers.
The more the merrier.

147
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:01,471
It's a date.
I have a date coming over.

148
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:06,325
You can't blame me for not
jumping to that conclusion.

149
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:10,943
Why? What's so unusual
about me having a date?

150
00:08:11,153 --> 00:08:13,637
- Statistically speaking...
- All right, all right.

151
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,248
Nevertheless, I have one now
and I'd appreciate it if you would,

152
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:18,625
make yourself scarce.

153
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,933
I'm a published theoretical physicist
with two doctorates

154
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:24,589
and an IQ which can't be accurely
measured by normal tests.

155
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,629
How much scarcer could I be?

156
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:30,679
You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?

157
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:33,883
- You want me to leave the apartment?
- Yes.

158
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:36,568
You mean, just go
someplace else and be...

159
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:37,916
someplace else?

160
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:39,688
Yes.

161
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,816
Why should I leave?
This is my apartment, too.

162
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:42,706
I know,

163
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:45,339
and if science ever discovers
a second member of your species

164
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,131
and you two would like some privacy,

165
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:49,357
I'd be more than happy
to get out of your way.

166
00:08:51,425 --> 00:08:52,796
Well, all right then.

167
00:08:58,811 --> 00:08:59,962
What are you doing?

168
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:01,539
Playing Super Mario

169
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:04,700
on a poorly coded
Nintendo 64 emulator.

170
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:07,875
Why are you doing it on the stairs?

171
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:11,959
I am a modern day Napoleon
exiled to the Elba of the staircase

172
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,563
because Leonard, get this,
has a date.

173
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,476
Good for him.

174
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:22,940
Why are you sitting here? Why don't you
just go to a movie or something?

175
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:24,132
Alone?

176
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,622
- Yeah, why not?
- What if I choke on my popcorn?

177
00:09:27,742 --> 00:09:29,814
Who will administer
the Heimlich maneuver?

178
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:32,115
Then don't order popcorn.

179
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:34,201
No popcorn at the mo...
listen to yourself.

180
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:38,527
- Why don't you go to a coffee shop?
- I don't drink coffee.

181
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,290
They have other things.

182
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:42,449
What do they have?

183
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:44,488
You know, cookies, pastries...

184
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:46,664
Pastries such as bear claws?

185
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:49,287
- Yeah, sure.
- I don't like bear claws.

186
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:51,971
Hey, Penny.

187
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,091
Dumbass.

188
00:09:55,635 --> 00:09:56,796
Leslie Winkle.

189
00:09:57,436 --> 00:10:00,576
Of all the overrated physicists
in all the labs in all the world,

190
00:10:00,696 --> 00:10:02,934
why does it have to be
Leslie Winkle?

191
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:06,893
They have a lot in common.
I mean, they're both scientists.

192
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:10,080
Oh, please. The only way she could make
a contribution to science

193
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,725
would be if they resumed
sending chimps into space.

194
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,903
Okay, well, I have a date, too,
so I'll see ya.

195
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:21,482
Everybody has a date.

196
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:25,420
Even you, Mario,
going after Princess Peach.

197
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:29,465
And what am I doing?
I'm just enabling you.

198
00:10:33,136 --> 00:10:35,846
- This is pretty good orange chicken.
- Yeah, it's from Chang's.

199
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:37,419
- Not Chow's?
- No, Chang's.

200
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,618
- What happened to Chow's?
- It changed.

201
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,608
So,

202
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:46,354
how many children
do you think we should have?

203
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:49,962
I'm sorry.
That was a little abrupt.

204
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:51,904
A little?

205
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,115
There are so many things to talk about
before we discuss reproduction.

206
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:56,472
I sure hope so.

207
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:01,872
Besides shortness, what genetic
weaknesses run in your family?

208
00:11:03,102 --> 00:11:04,313
Sorry to interrupt.

209
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,083
Battery's dying. Continue.

210
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,730
Genetic weakness, right.

211
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,757
There's the lactose intolerance.

212
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:14,109
Don't forget
the male-pattern baldness.

213
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:17,007
When his uncles sit around
the dinner table,

214
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:19,076
they look like a half carton of eggs.

215
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:40,880
Okay, my uncles are bald,

216
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,936
but my Aunt Edna is one
of the hairiest women you'll ever meet.

217
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:46,607
Sweet lady.

218
00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:48,657
Always tickles when she hugs me.

219
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,033
- What now?
- I have to make pee-pee.

220
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:04,891
I'm sorry
about all of Sheldon's interruptions.

221
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:06,770
He can be a bit of an eccentric.

222
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:09,233
If by "eccentric"
you mean passive-aggressive

223
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,066
East Texas blowhole, I agree.

224
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,820
I think tonight was a very good start.

225
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:15,981
Me, too.

226
00:12:16,314 --> 00:12:18,289
You sure you're okay
postponing intercourse

227
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:21,076
until our relationship is past
the initial viability test?

228
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,580
No problem, I'm very skilled
at postponing intercourse.

229
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:29,668
I guess I'll call you
and we'll arrange another evening.

230
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,517
I believe protocol dictates you wait
a minimum of 18 hours before you call

231
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:36,133
so I'm not repulsed
by your cloying eagerness.

232
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:37,176
Sure.

233
00:12:37,337 --> 00:12:39,595
Again, it's your decision.
You're the man.

234
00:12:39,974 --> 00:12:41,278
It wasn't my cat.

235
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:44,338
It was an experiment
designed by this guy named Schroedinger.

236
00:12:46,704 --> 00:12:48,770
From the Charlie Brown cartoons?

237
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:52,919
No, he was some kind of scientist.
Let me start again.

238
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:55,360
- Hey, Leonard.
- Hello.

239
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,870
- Leslie.
- Hi.

240
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:03,507
Okay, well... good night.

241
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:07,830
Okay, good night.

242
00:13:10,494 --> 00:13:12,162
That ain't gonna make your point.

243
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,769
That's enough.

244
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:30,229
Call me.

245
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:33,299
Right.

246
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,735
Okay, good night.

247
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:39,082
- What?
- Had a great time. Ciao.

248
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:44,907
I'm sorry, I am not going back
to the Renaissance fair.

249
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:46,565
Come on,

250
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:49,804
there's so few places
I can wear my jester costume.

251
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:52,558
I don't care.

252
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:55,337
There are far too many
historical anomalies for my comfort.

253
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,096
Okay, how about this?

254
00:13:57,216 --> 00:13:59,909
You can go dressed
as a Star Trek science officer

255
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:02,975
exploring a planet similar
to Earth in the 1500s.

256
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:05,864
You mean, like Spock?

257
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:07,719
Sure.

258
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:09,446
Fascinating.

259
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:14,030
Hey, fellow scientists...

260
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:19,820
Why don't we all move over there
so Leslie can join us?

261
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:21,113
Let's do it.

262
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:28,993
If you're having trouble
deciding where to sit,

263
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:30,847
may I suggest one potato, two potato?

264
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:34,335
Or as I call it, "the Leslie Winkle
experimental methodology."

265
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:40,007
- Don't make this hard for me.
- It's not hard.

266
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:41,058
It's simple.

267
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:43,888
You can either sit with me,
your friend, colleague and roommate

268
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,097
or with an overrated scientist
you might have sex with.

269
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:50,702
You're right, it is simple.

270
00:14:56,548 --> 00:14:58,318
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Penny.

271
00:14:58,672 --> 00:15:00,833
Third floor tonight...
mixing it up?

272
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:08,123
I still don't understand why you don't
go to dinner or something.

273
00:15:08,431 --> 00:15:10,946
All right,
let's say I go to dinner alone,

274
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:13,331
and during the meal,
I have to use the restroom.

275
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:15,960
How do I know
someone's not touching my food?

276
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,271
Good night, Sheldon.

277
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:23,311
Penny, hold on.

278
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,054
Are you sure things can't
work out with you and Leonard?

279
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:28,249
Excuse me?

280
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:29,473
I'm just wondering

281
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:31,890
if you really gave it
the old college try.

282
00:15:33,762 --> 00:15:36,120
Or in your case,
the old community college try.

283
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:40,567
Okay, where is this coming from?

284
00:15:41,251 --> 00:15:44,009
Leonard is upstairs right now
with my archenemy.

285
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:45,926
Your archenemy?

286
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:48,851
The Dr. Doom to my Mr. Fantastic.

287
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:52,954
The Dr. Octopus to my Spider-Man,
the Dr. Sivana to my Captain Marvel.

288
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:54,115
I get it.

289
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:57,959
It's amazing how many supervillains
have advanced degrees.

290
00:15:59,663 --> 00:16:02,964
Graduate school should do a better job
of screening those people out.

291
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,008
Sheldon, come back.
You're losing me.

292
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:06,858
It's Leslie Winkle, Penny.

293
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:08,553
She belittles my research.

294
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,939
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

295
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,869
She called me "dumbass."

296
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:15,519
I know. I heard.

297
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:17,267
Given this situation,

298
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:20,021
I have no choice but to withdraw
my previous objections

299
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:22,909
to your ill-considered
relationship with Leonard.

300
00:16:24,138 --> 00:16:26,337
Gee, well, thank you for that.

301
00:16:26,815 --> 00:16:27,977
But I think for now,

302
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:29,908
Leonard and I are just gonna
stay friends.

303
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:32,371
No, that response
is unacceptable to me.

304
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:36,247
Sheldon, you are
a smart guy...

305
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:37,499
I'm "smart"?

306
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:41,055
I'd have to lose 60 IQ points
to be classified as "smart."

307
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:44,339
- Are you gonna let me talk?
- I'm sorry.

308
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:47,830
You must know that if Leonard
and Leslie want to be together,

309
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,877
nothing you can do is gonna stop it.

310
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:53,382
You continue to underestimate
my capabilities, madam.

311
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,876
Let me put it this way.
If you're really Leonard's friend,

312
00:16:57,996 --> 00:17:00,825
you will support him
no matter who he wants to be with.

313
00:17:01,307 --> 00:17:04,526
Wait a minute.
Why am I doing all the giving here?

314
00:17:05,283 --> 00:17:08,225
If Leonard's really my friend,
why doesn't he have to support me

315
00:17:08,345 --> 00:17:10,365
and my hatred of Leslie Winkle?

316
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:14,539
Because love trumps hate.

317
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:17,558
Now you're just making stuff up.

318
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:20,357
Okay, good night, Sheldon.

319
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,954
Mario...

320
00:17:24,535 --> 00:17:27,517
If only I could control everyone
the way I control you.

321
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:32,400
Hop, you little plumber,
hop, hop, hop.

322
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:39,741
When the two of you reach
a natural stopping point,

323
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,455
I'd like to have a word.

324
00:17:42,242 --> 00:17:44,608
If the word is "pee-pee,"
just do it.

325
00:17:50,248 --> 00:17:51,888
Leonard, you're my friend,

326
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:55,243
and friends support
their friends... apparently.

327
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:57,650
So I'm withdrawing my objection

328
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,040
to your desire
to have a relationship with Leslie.

329
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:03,084
- Thank you.
- I will graciously

330
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:05,153
overlook the fact
that she is an arrogant,

331
00:18:05,273 --> 00:18:08,710
subpar scientist who actually
believes loop quantum gravity

332
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,220
better unites quantum mechanics
with general relativity

333
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,748
than does string theory.

334
00:18:14,121 --> 00:18:15,351
You kids have fun.

335
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:17,558
Hang on a second.

336
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,853
Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more
testable predictions than string theory.

337
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:24,257
I'm listening. Amuse me.

338
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:29,079
For one thing, we expect
quantized space-time to manifest itself

339
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:31,994
as minute differences in the speed
of light for different colors.

340
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:35,417
Balderdash.
Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.

341
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:39,948
Are you gonna let him
talk to me like that?

342
00:18:45,052 --> 00:18:47,549
Okay, well, there is a lot
of merit to both theories.

343
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,615
No, there isn't.
Only loop quantum gravity

344
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:51,466
calculates the entropy of black holes.

345
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:57,848
Sheldon, don't make that noise.
It's disrespectful.

346
00:18:58,008 --> 00:19:00,642
I should hope so.
It was a snort of derision.

347
00:19:01,632 --> 00:19:02,950
You agree with me, right?

348
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,480
Loop quantum gravity
is the future of physics.

349
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,666
Sorry, Leslie, I guess I prefer
my space stringy, not loopy.

350
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:14,281
I'm glad I found out the truth about you
before this went any further.

351
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:16,100
Truth? What truth?

352
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,327
We're talking about untested hypothes.
It's no big deal.

353
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:20,575
It isn't? Really?

354
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:22,960
Tell me,
how will we raise the children?

355
00:19:26,447 --> 00:19:30,447
I guess we wait until they're old enough
and let them choose their own theory.

356
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:32,758
We can't let them choose.
They're children!

357
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,344
Where are you going?

358
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:39,200
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,912
I could have accepted our kids being
genetically unable to eat ice cream

360
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:45,186
or ever get a good view of a parade.

361
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:47,681
But this?

362
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:49,522
This is a deal breaker.

363
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,382
Look on the bright side.

364
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:07,292
What's the bright side?

365
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:09,858
Only nine more months
to Comic-con.

366
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:26,624
Captain, I'm getting
an unusual reading.

367
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:29,856
That's great.
You guys want corn dogs?

368
00:20:31,682 --> 00:20:33,360
That's a temporal anomaly.

369
00:20:34,253 --> 00:20:38,230
Corn dog's didn't come into existence
till the first half of the 20th century.
