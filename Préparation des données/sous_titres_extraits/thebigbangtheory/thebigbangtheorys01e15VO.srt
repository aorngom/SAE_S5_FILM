1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,760
On the other hand,
some physicists are concerned that

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,650
If this supercollider
actually works,

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,760
it'll create a black hole
and swallow up the earth,

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,190
ending life as we know it.

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,450
What a bunch of crybabies.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,420
No guts, no glory, man.

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,260
Hey, check it out.

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,390
The school of pharmacology
is looking for volunteers.

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,080
"We are testing a new
medication "for social anxiety,

10
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:25,230
panic attacks, agoraphobia and
obsessive compulsive disorder. "

11
00:00:26,784 --> 00:00:28,735
Why would they be looking
for test subjects here?

12
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:31,659
I don't know, raj.

13
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:34,549
Maybe the comic book store
doesn't have a bulletin board.

14
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:39,243
What's going on?

15
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:41,211
Hot girl in sheldon's office.

16
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:42,971
Sheldon's office?

17
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:46,542
Is she lost?

18
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:48,620
I don't think so.

19
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,712
I followed her here
from the parking lot.

20
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:54,302
Maybe she's his lawyer.

21
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:56,920
Well, she's free to
examine my briefs.

22
00:00:57,087 --> 00:00:58,450
-Howard.
-I know,I'm disgusting.

23
00:00:58,456 --> 00:01:00,342
I should be punished... by her.

24
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:02,291
Oh, look, I did it again.

25
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:04,151
That should do it.

26
00:01:04,258 --> 00:01:05,990
Thank you for coming by.

27
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:13,652
Hello.

28
00:01:13,828 --> 00:01:20,752
-Oh,hey,buddy...
-"buddy..."?

29
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:22,180
Sorry I'm late.

30
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:23,602
I'm working on a project that

31
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:26,002
may take me up on the
next space shuttle.

32
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:28,013
How can you be late?

33
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,851
I wasn't expecting you at all.

34
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:32,041
Nobody ever expects me.

35
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:33,740
Sometimes you just
look and... bam!

36
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:35,993
Howard wolowitz.

37
00:01:36,937 --> 00:01:38,452
Sheldon, are you
gonna introduce us?

38
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:40,811
Oh, all right.
Uh, this is missy.

39
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:42,970
Missy, this is
leonard and rajesh,

40
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:44,601
and you've already met howard.

41
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:45,702
It's nice to meet you.

42
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:47,942
You, too, as well, also. Yeah.

43
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:52,341
So, how do you two
know each other?

44
00:01:52,516 --> 00:01:53,842
Oh, he once spent nine months

45
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:56,390
with my legs wrapped
around his head.

46
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:00,840
Excuse me?

47
00:02:01,816 --> 00:02:03,023
She's my twin sister.

48
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:04,961
She thinks she's funny,
but frankly,

49
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:06,552
I've never been able to see it.

50
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:09,701
That's because you have no
measurable sense of humor, shelly.

51
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:12,330
How exactly would one
measure sea nse of humor?

52
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:14,373
A humormometer?

53
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:19,303
Well, I think you're
delightfully droll.

54
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:22,563
Or, as the french say,
trs drale.

55
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:24,422
Okay, so let me
see if I got this.

56
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:28,922
Leonard, howard and...
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

57
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,891
Rajesh.

58

theory Season 1 Episode 15</font>

61
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:23,223
So missy,
what brings you all the way from texas?

62
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,801
Was it perhaps destiny?
I think it was destiny.

63
00:03:26,188 --> 00:03:28,331
My friend's getting married
at disneyland tomorrow night.

64
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:32,102
Destiny, thy name is anaheim.

65
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:34,932
And I had to drop off
some papers for shelly

66
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:36,683
to sign for my dad's estate.

67
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:37,951
The papers could've
been mailed.

68
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:40,611
Mom just sent you here to spy on me,
didn't she?

69
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:42,822
I guess that's why they
call you a genius.

70
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:45,913
They call me a genius
because I'm a genius.

71
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:49,132
Tell mom that I currently
weigh 165 pounds

72
00:03:49,156 --> 00:03:51,662
and that I'm having
regular bowel movements.

73
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:55,000
Enjoy the wedding. Good-bye.

74
00:03:57,627 --> 00:03:58,901
If the wedding's
not until tomorrow,

75
00:03:58,935 --> 00:04:00,552
why don't you stay
with us tonight?

76
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:02,300
Oh, I don't think so.

77
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:04,113
Shelly doesn't like company.

78
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:04,900
Even as a little boy,

79
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:07,780
he'd send his imaginary friends
home at the end of the day.

80
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:09,480
They were not friends.

81
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,902
They were imaginary colleagues.

82
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:14,693
Look, you're here.
We have plenty of room.

83
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:15,580
No, we don'T.

84
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:18,760
Come on, shelly. She's family.

85
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:21,453
So what,
ion't issue invitations to your mother.

86
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:25,340
Well, it would be nice not to have
to drive to anaheim in rush hour.

87
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:27,340
And don't ever call me shelly.

88
00:04:27,827 --> 00:04:29,960
So it's settled:
You'll stay with us.

89
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:30,950
Yeah, I'll walk
you to your car.

90
00:04:30,985 --> 00:04:33,122
You're in structure 3,
level c, right?

91
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,573
What just happened?

92
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,053
So anyway,
we're eight years old

93
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:45,292
and sheldon converts
my easy bake oven

94
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:47,750
to some kind of
high-powered furnace.

95
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:49,793
Just classic.

96
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:53,663
I needed a place to fire
ceramic semiconductor substrates

97
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,451
for homemade
integrated circuits.

98
00:04:56,156 --> 00:04:58,172
He was trying to build
some sort of armed robot

99
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,681
to keep me out of his room.

100
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,410
Made necessary by her insistence
on going into my room.

101
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:06,252
Anyway, I go to make those little
corn muffins they give you.

102
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:07,073
There's a big flash.

103
00:05:07,085 --> 00:05:09,903
Next thing you know
my eyebrows are gone.

104
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:13,051
Not your eyebrows.

105
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,232
Yep, I had to go through
the entire second grade

106
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:18,682
with crooked eyebrows
my mom drew on.

107
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:20,622
Is that what that was?

108
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:22,402
I just assumed that the
second grade curriculum

109
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:24,291
had rendered you quizzical.

110
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:31,093
Hey, leonard, you left your
underwear in the dryer downstairs.

111
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,441
Those are not mine.

112
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:42,851
Really? They have your
little name label in them.

113
00:05:44,225 --> 00:05:46,830
Yeah... no, I do...
I... I use those, uh,

114
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:51,122
just to polish up my
spearfishing equipment.

115
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:54,081
I spearfish.

116
00:05:57,688 --> 00:06:00,432
When I'm not crossbow hunting,
I spearfish.

117
00:06:02,707 --> 00:06:05,323
Uh, penny,
this is sheldon's twin sister, missy.

118
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:07,240
-Missy,this is our neighbor,penny.
-Hi.

119
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:08,803
You don't look that much alike.

120
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,960
Can I get a hallelujah?

121
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,210
Fraternal twins come
from two separate eggs.

122
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:16,292
They are no more alike
than any other siblings.

123
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:18,260
Hallelujah!

124
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:20,323
Hey, guess what.

125
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:22,823
I've been accepted as a test
subject for a new miracle drug

126
00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:25,013
to overcome
pathological shyness.

127
00:06:25,238 --> 00:06:27,010
Oh, good for you, raj.

128
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:28,352
Yes, I'm very hopeful.

129
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:29,881
Hello, missy.

130
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,323
They mentioned there
may be side effects.

131
00:06:44,318 --> 00:06:46,852
So, missy,
have you ever met a man

132
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:49,953
from the exotic
subcontinent of india?

133
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:52,932
Well, there's dr.
Patel at our church.

134
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:55,331
Ah, yes, patel-- good man.

135
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:58,440
Do you like motorcycles?
'Cause I ride a hog.

136
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:00,260
A hog?

137
00:07:00,307 --> 00:07:03,120
You have a two-cylinder scooter
with a basket in the front.

138
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:07,042
You still have to
wear a helmet.

139
00:07:08,615 --> 00:07:10,230
Have you ever heard
of the kama sutra?

140
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:13,551
-The sex book.
-the indian sex book.

141
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,412
In other words,
if you "wonder, wonder

142
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:18,831
who wrote the book of love,
" it was us.

143
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:23,440
-So,sheldon's sister is pretty cute
-I wasn't staring.

144
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:28,575
I didn't say you were.
I just said she was cute.

145
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:37,629
Oh, maybe, if you like women
who are tall... and perfect.

146
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:42,119
Sheldon, why are you
ignoring your sister?

147
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:45,541
I'm not ignoring my sister.
I'm ignoring all of you.

148
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:47,861
I brought snacks!

149
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:52,043
Oh, my, gherkins and...

150
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,991
Onion dip. It's onion dip.

151
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:58,962
We don't entertain much.

152
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:03,720
Missy. Do you enjoy pajamas?

153
00:08:04,037 --> 00:08:04,692
I guess.

154
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:06,932
Yeah, we indians invented them.

155
00:08:07,757 --> 00:08:09,081
You're welcome.

156
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:13,200
Yeah, well,
my people invented circumcision.

157
00:08:17,986 --> 00:08:20,153
You're welcome.

158
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:23,021
Missy, I'm gonna go
get my nails done.

159
00:08:23,058 --> 00:08:25,120
-Do you want to come?
-God,yes.

160
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:28,212
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

161
00:08:29,157 --> 00:08:29,933
Bye, guys.

162
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,662
-Bye,missy.
-Bye,missy,see you.

163
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:35,300
-Good-bye,leonard.
-Oh,yeah,no,uh,bye,penny.

164
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:38,220
Okay, you two have to back off.

165
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:39,931
Why should I back off?
You back off, dude.

166
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:42,932
Excuse me, this is my apartment,
and she's my roommate's sister.

167
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,520
So what?
You've already got penny!

168
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:45,762
How do I have penny?

169
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:48,411
In what universe
do I have penny?

170
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:51,403
-So I can have penny?
-Hell,no!

171
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:55,293
Excuse me.
Can I interject something?

172
00:08:56,395 --> 00:08:57,971
I'm ordering pizza online.

173
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:00,250
Is everyone okay
with pepperoni?

174
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,230
-Sheldon,can I talk to you in private?
-I guess.

175
00:09:05,597 --> 00:09:07,951
Don't worry.
I was going to order you cheese-less.

176
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:08,952
-Thank you.
-It's okay.

177
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:12,011
Lactose intolerance is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

178
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:17,170
I'm a fancy indian man.
We invented pajamas.

179
00:09:18,106 --> 00:09:20,542
Hey, look at me.
I don't have a foreskin.

180
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:29,063
Sheldon...

181
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,070
Are you aware that your sister

182
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:35,263
is an incredibly
attractive woman?

183
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:39,630
She certainly has the
symmetry and low body fat

184
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:41,793
that western culture
deems desirable.

185
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:44,440
It's noteworthy,
at other points in history,

186
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:46,322
heavier women were the
standard for beauty

187
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,892
because their girth
suggested affluence.

188
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:51,910
-That's fascinating,but...
-I didn't say it was fascinating.

189
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:53,593
I said it was noteworthy.

190
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:57,022
All right, but... noted.

191
00:09:57,408 --> 00:10:00,610
My point is that
koothrappali and wolowitz,

192
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:03,180
they're hitting on your sister.

193
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,630
Oh, it'S...

194
00:10:06,035 --> 00:10:08,210
Oh, ay.

195
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:10,951
You know, I don't want to
criticize your rhetorical style,

196
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:13,043
but we'd be a lot further
along in this conversation

197
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:15,041
if you'd begun
with that thought.

198
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:16,630
That's great, but my...

199
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,533
What I'm saying is that we took
quite an unnecessary detour

200
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,050
from what I now understand
to be your thesis.

201
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:21,373
Whatever.

202
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:26,090
-You have to do something about it.
-Why?

203
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:28,031
Because she's your sister.

204
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:30,470
I don't understand.

205
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:33,401
Yes, we shared a uterus
for nine months,

206
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:36,363
but since then we've pretty much
gone our own separate ways.

207
00:10:37,316 --> 00:10:41,803
Okay, uh, consider this...
with your father gone,

208
00:10:41,846 --> 00:10:44,800
it is your responsibility
to make sure that

209
00:10:44,825 --> 00:10:47,333
missy chooses a suitable mate.

210
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:50,780
I hadn't considered that.

211
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,793
We do share dna.

212
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:55,662
So there is the possibility,
however remote,

213
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,891
that resting in her
loins is the potential

214
00:10:57,937 --> 00:11:01,310
for another individual
as remarkable as myself.

215
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:03,941
Exactly.

216
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:07,710
And you owe it to yourself
and to posterity to protect

217
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:10,982
the genetic integrity of your
sister's future offspring.

218
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:14,090
You're right.

219
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:16,963
If someone wants to get at
missy's fallopian tubes,

220
00:11:16,985 --> 00:11:19,023
they'll have to go through me.

221
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:32,202
I am shiva the destroyer!
I will have the woman.

222
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:37,792
I'm warnin ug yo I was judo
champion at math camp.

223
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:40,163
All right,
now that's enough juvenile squabbling.

224
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:42,922
You stop it. Stop it, I say!

225
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:45,291
I'm going to settle
this right now.

226
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:48,273
Neither of you are good
enough for my sister.

227
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,803
Who are you to decide that?

228
00:11:49,848 --> 00:11:51,533
He's the man of his family.

229
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,033
You have to respect his wishes.

230
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:55,501
-You're out,too,by the way.
-Say what?

231
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:56,703
It's nothing personal.

232
00:11:56,728 --> 00:11:58,310
I'd just prefer if my
future niece or nephew

233
00:11:58,346 --> 00:12:01,522
didn't become flatulent every
time they ate an eskimo pie.

234
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:10,083
What are you so happy about?

235
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,163
I'm not happy.

236
00:12:11,186 --> 00:12:14,133
It's the medication.
I can't stop smiling.

237
00:12:19,978 --> 00:12:23,200
Now that leonard's made me aware of
how high the genetic stakes are,

238
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:24,900
we have to face the
fact that none of you

239
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:26,732
are suitable mates
for my sister.

240
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:30,123
Wait a minute.
Leonard made you aware of that?

241
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:33,320
We all make mistakes.
Let's move on.

242
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:36,742
Excuse me, but I think you're
missing a big opportunity here.

243
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:37,570
How so?

244
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:41,211
Everybody knows genetic diversity
produces the strongest offspring.

245
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:44,530
Why not put a little
mocha in the family latte?

246
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:49,233
In principle, you have a point.

247
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:51,410
But as a practical matter,
need I remind you that

248
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:54,282
it takes experimental
pharmaceuticals to simply enable you

249
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:56,482
to speak to the opposite sex.

250
00:12:57,326 --> 00:13:00,012
I think you're focusing
entirely too much on the drugs.

251
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:07,452
Is it 'cause I'm jewish?

252
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:10,913
'Cause I'd kill my rabbi with a
pork chop to be with your sister.

253
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:19,531
This has nothing to
do with religion.

254
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:22,021
This has to do with the fact
that you're a tiny, tiny man

255
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:23,983
who still lives
with his mother.

256
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:27,421
Sheldon, you are really
being unreasonable.

257
00:13:27,657 --> 00:13:28,531
Am I?

258
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:30,831
Here, eat this cheese
without farting

259
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:33,081
and you can sleep
with my sister.

260
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:35,901
Oh, really?

261
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:46,371
Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute?
Alone.

262
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,100
Why does everyone suddenly
want to talk to me alone?

263
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:51,602
Usually nobody wants
to be alone with me.

264
00:13:57,835 --> 00:14:00,102
We all make mistakes.
Let's move on.

265
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:04,702
Okay, I'm not even going to ask

266
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:06,711
why you're pimping
me out for cheese.

267
00:14:07,998 --> 00:14:11,463
But since when do you care at
all about who I sleep with?

268
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:13,710
Well, truthfully,
I've never given it any thought,

269
00:14:13,747 --> 00:14:15,393
but it has been
pointed out to me that

270
00:14:15,427 --> 00:14:17,510
you carry dna of
great potential.

271
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,831
-What on earth are you talking about?
-Let me explain.

272
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:23,662
You see,
I'm a superior genetic mutation,

273
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:27,393
an improvement on the
existing mediocre stock.

274
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:31,503
And what do you mean,
"mediocre stock"?

275
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,890
That would be you.

276
00:14:34,128 --> 00:14:37,551
But residing within you,
is the potential for another me.

277
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,511
Perhaps even taller, smarter,

278
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:43,980
and less prone to freckling,
a sheldon 2. 0, if you will.

279
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:47,841
-"Sheldon 2.0"?
-Exactly.

280
00:14:47,848 --> 00:14:50,320
Now, I am not saying
that I should be

281
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:52,040
the sole decider of
who you mate with.

282
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:53,341
If you're not attracted
to the suitor,

283
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:55,531
then the likelihood of
conception will be reduced.

284
00:14:55,557 --> 00:14:58,071
-You have got to be kidding me.
-Not at all.

285
00:14:58,075 --> 00:15:01,551
Frequent coitus dramatically
increases the odds of fertilization.

286
00:15:02,686 --> 00:15:04,910
Okay, shelly, sit down.

287
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:10,061
Now I've lived my whole
life dealing with the fact

288
00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:13,270
that my twin brother is,
as mom puts it,

289
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:15,891
"one of god's special,
little people. "

290
00:15:16,775 --> 00:15:19,110
I always thought I was
more like a cuckoo bird.

291
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:21,220
You know,
a superior creature whose egg

292
00:15:21,248 --> 00:15:23,481
is placed in the nest
of ordinary birds.

293
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:25,580
Of course, the newly hatched
cuckoo eats all the food,

294
00:15:25,616 --> 00:15:28,203
leaving the ordinary
siblings to starve to death.

295
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:31,681
Luckily for you,
that's where the metaphor ended.

296
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:35,690
I thought it ended
at "cuckoo. "

297
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,512
You listen to me.

298
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:41,273
If you want to start
acting like a brother

299
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:43,370
who cares about me,
then terrific.

300
00:15:43,487 --> 00:15:44,483
Bring it on.

301
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,043
But you try one time to tell me
who I should be sleeping with,

302
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:49,230
and you and I are
going to go round

303
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:51,142
and round the way we
did when we were little.

304
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:52,530
Remember?

305
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:57,972
I have an alternate proposal.

306
00:15:57,996 --> 00:15:59,161
Go on.

307
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:00,733
You donate eggs.

308
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:02,632
We will place them in
cryogenic storage.

309
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:05,531
I will find an appropriate
sperm donor for your eggs,

310
00:16:05,575 --> 00:16:08,293
have them fertilized
and implanted in you.

311
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:10,031
That way, everybody wins.

312
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:20,331
Correction.

313
00:16:20,425 --> 00:16:22,982
Missy can date
whoever she wants.

314
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:26,221
Look, we have to settle this.

315
00:16:26,438 --> 00:16:27,341
I agree.

316
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:29,021
Sheldon's sister is
hiding at penny's

317
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:31,223
because we've all been hitting
on her at the same time.

318
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:32,392
She's not hiding.

319
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,293
She needed privacy to
call her grandmother

320
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:35,552
who's apparently very sick.

321
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,621
Oh, and then I believe
she has to wash her hair.

322
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:41,550
Oh, you poor, deluded bastard.

323
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:42,772
Don't start with me, dude.

324
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:44,101
You want to go again?
Let's go.

325
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:45,980
-Sit down.
-Okay.

326
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:49,773
If we're going to fight over missy,
let's do it the right way.

327
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:51,410
The honorable way.

328
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:53,843
Take that!

329
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:56,002
You want some more?

330
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:01,543
And he's down!

331
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:05,940
Come on, come on! Get up!

332
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:07,883
Stay down, bitch!

333
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:15,223
Yeah! Natural
selection at work.

334
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:17,180
I weep for humanity.

335
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:20,612
Excuse me while I go tell
missy the good news.

336
00:17:27,768 --> 00:17:29,191
-Hey,leonard.
-Oh,hi,penny.  How's it going?

337
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:31,151
Listen, that guy mike
that you were dating,

338
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:32,123
is that still going on?

339
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,911
-pretty much. Why?
-Nothing,just catching up.

340
00:17:33,948 --> 00:17:36,773
By the way,
may I speak to missy, please?

341
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,080
Of course.

342
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:41,901
Hi, leonard. What's up?

343
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:43,383
Well, since you're
leaving tomorrow,

344
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:46,073
I was wondering if you'd like
to go to dinner with me.

345
00:17:46,438 --> 00:17:49,083
That's so sweet. But no thanks.

346
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:54,003
-Do you have other plans or...?
-No.

347
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:02,321
All right,
enjoy the rest of your evening.

348
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,473
Thanks. See ya.

349
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:13,911
Here's something we
didn't anticipate.

350
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,512
What do you want, howard?

351
00:18:21,695 --> 00:18:24,011
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

352
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:27,431
I've come to call on missy.

353
00:18:28,028 --> 00:18:29,620
Missy.

354
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,291
Hi, howard.

355
00:18:32,356 --> 00:18:34,533
The amazing howard.

356
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:38,493
-Do you like magic?
-Not really.  No.

357
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:42,303
Then you are in for a treat.

358
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:46,223
Behold, an ordinary cane.

359
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:55,722
No.

360
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,282
Okay.

361
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,071
Missy.

362
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:19,682
Thank you.

363
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:27,571
I apprec...
apprec... appreeee...

364
00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:32,523
Oh, honey.
Is your medication wearing off?

365
00:19:35,518 --> 00:19:37,062
Well, hi, tie pie.

366
00:19:37,086 --> 00:19:39,110
I was hoping you'd show up.

367
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:11,381
We had a dog who made a noise
like tha had to put him down.

368
00:20:14,726 --> 00:20:16,781
Any news you want me
to pass along to mom?

369
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:19,321
Well, she might be
interested to know that

370
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:22,202
I have refocused my research
from bosonic string theory

371
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:23,863
to heterotic string theory.

372
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:26,651
Yeah, I'll just tell
her you say "hey. "

373
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:31,511
Okay, well,
it was pleasant seeing you,

374
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:34,141
other than that business
with my testicles.

375
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,843
Come on, shelly.

376
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:45,572
I want you to know
I'm very proud of you.

377
00:20:45,597 --> 00:20:46,773
Really?

378
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:49,253
Yep, I'm always bragging to
my friends about my brother,

379
00:20:49,277 --> 00:20:51,032
the rocket scientist.

380
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:54,843
You tell people I'm
a rocket scientist?

381
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:56,922
Well, yeah.

382
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,231
I'm a theoretical physicist.

383
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,783
-What's the difference?
-What's the difference?!

384
00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:04,653
Good-bye, shelly.

385
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:08,471
My god!
Why don't you just tell them

386
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:11,832
that I'm a toll-taker at
the golden gate bridge?!

387
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:16,632
Rocket scientist.
How humiliating.
