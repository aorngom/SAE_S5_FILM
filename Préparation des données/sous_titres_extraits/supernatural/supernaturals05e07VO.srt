1
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,073
Hey, babe.

2
00:00:13,784 --> 00:00:15,279
Nice to see you, too.

3
00:00:59,165 --> 00:01:00,373
Honey?

4
00:01:00,817 --> 00:01:02,911
Are you okay?

5
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:14,456
Supernatural 507

6
00:01:23,888 --> 00:01:26,084
you expect me to believe you're cdc?

7
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,481
- Excuse me?
- It's just that you're a day early.

8
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:33,833
First time in history i haven't sat
on my ass waiting for you people.

9
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,472
New administration.

10
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:37,475
A change you can believe in.

11
00:01:38,423 --> 00:01:39,669
Right.

12
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,797
Meet xavier.

13
00:01:46,922 --> 00:01:49,791
Date of birth april 3, 1984.

14
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,604
I know. I ran the dna twice.

15
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,030
That's definitely him.

16
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:58,270
He wasn't big on the sunscreen, huh?

17
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:00,245
What's your theory?

18
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,477
All i know is,
decedent's male, 25 years old,

19
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:05,773
and he died of old age.

20
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,750
You were right about this one.
It's definitely a job.

21
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,930
Thought so.
Any other stiffs in town?

22
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,632
- just the one body.
- Anything else?

23
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:24,351
Couple missing persons,
but usual for a town this size.

24
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,105
- check 'em out.
- You think they're connected?

25
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,219
Call it a hunch.
You got it.

26
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:31,637
And, by the way, how you doing?

27
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:35,196
- doing?
- Yeah. Just in general?

28
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,348
You mean my legs.

29
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:40,484
I'm just weepin' in my haagen-dazs.

30
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:42,277
Idjit.

31
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,157
That's the most recent.

32
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,871
- How long has he been missing?
- I knew right away

33
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,039
when he didn't come
home tuesday night.

34
00:03:03,164 --> 00:03:06,317
Is there someplace he likes
to go after work, maybe?

35
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:10,214
- A favorite bar?
- Tuesdays, he always works a bit late,

36
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:12,933
but he always comes straight home.

37
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:16,070
May i use your facilities, ma'am?

38
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,701
"Working late," my ass.

39
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:44,367
At least he's consistent.
Same room every tuesday, hourly rates.

40
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:46,550
Hope i got that kind of kick
when i'm his age.

41
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:49,250
Yeah, like either of us
will live that long.

42
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,621
True.

43
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:53,181
What do you think's in there?

44
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:55,514
A wrinkly, gooey corpse.

45
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,330
Oh, god!
Oh, god!

46
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:14,424
Oh. God.

47
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,154
It's gooey.

48
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:19,852
Sorry...

49
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:22,124
- got the wrong room.
- Close the door!

50
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:27,969
Nice tattoo.

51
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:32,019
Happen to know anybody
named cliff whitlow?

52
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:35,572
- Never heard of him.
- That's weird.

53
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:38,059
'cause you're carrying his wallet.

54
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:47,311
Your wife told us about your,
birthmark there. That's nice.

55
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,568
You look great, cliff.

56
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:51,380
Did you get some work done?

57
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,166
Could you give us some privacy?

58
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,926
Thanks.

59
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,685
Thanks.

60
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,090
- Please don't tell my wife.
- Slow down.

61
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:08,220
I'm begging you.
As far as she knows, i'm dead.

62
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:10,232
For the love of god,
let's keep it that way.

63
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:13,337
- how can you possibly be cliff whitlow?
- I can't tell you.

64
00:05:13,462 --> 00:05:15,706
Either you tell us
or we tell the missus.

65
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:17,741
It was a game.

66
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:19,896
Like xbox?

67
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:22,272
What's xbox?

68
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:24,282
No.
Poker, high-stakes.

69
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,163
Instead of cash, you play for years.

70
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:29,853
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I know it sounds crazy.

71
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:32,523
Guy comes up to me at a bar,
invites me to play.

72
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:35,093
Gives me 25 of these
weirdo poker chips, right?

73
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,061
Chants some mumbo humbo over them,

74
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:39,416
says now they're 25 years.

75
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,733
I'm laughing.
But then i come out up.

76
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:44,302
And look at me.

77
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,410
- what was he chanting?
- How should i know?

78
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:49,279
All i know is my bad hip's good,
i threw away my glasses.

79
00:05:49,404 --> 00:05:52,477
One of those ladies was here for free!
Man's some kind of miracle worker.

80
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,640
What does this miracle worker
look like?

81
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:57,856
Just a guy. Maybe 35, brown hair.

82
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,051
- Irish accent. His name was patrick.
- All right. Where's this game at?

83
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:04,412
He said he likes to keep moving.
Never stays in one bar long.

84
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,435
And he finds you.

85
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:09,672
Thank you, cliff.

86
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,427
And...

87
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,928
stay classy.

88
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,175
- it sounds crazy, right?
- No, there's lore on it.

89
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,167
Goes back centuries.

90
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,435
Traveling card player
pops into town.

91
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,481
You beat him,
you get your best years back.

92
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:32,507
'course, most folks lose.

93
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,352
That would explain
the crunchy corpse.

94
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,611
Supposedly, this player's
a hell of a card shark.

95
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,061
Got a lot of years in the bank.

96
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:41,959
- you find the bar he's working in yet?
- There's a lot of dives in this town.

97
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,689
- we're gonna have to split up.
- Why you still talking to me?

98
00:06:57,352 --> 00:07:00,151
- find anything?
- Yeah, a whole bunch of squat. You?

99
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,704
- no, not a thing.
- All right.

100
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:05,749
You come up dry,
circle back to the motel in two.

101
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:07,785
Your turn to grab dinner.

102
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,911
Extra bacon.

103
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:11,913
Can i get a beer?

104
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:17,514
You wouldn't happen to know of a
poker gamegoing on in back, would you?

105
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:21,315
It's a bar, not a casino.

106
00:07:23,258 --> 00:07:26,170
My friend ben told me you'd know.

107
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:28,675
- Don't know any ben.
- Sure you do.

108
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,221
Balding, smart-ass,
real ladies' man?

109
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:36,280
Listen, pal,
i told you. I don't know any ben.

110
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:38,516
I don't know nothing about a game.

111
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:40,908
You sure?
'cause...

112
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:44,212
he sure seems to know you.

113
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,418
'round back.
Take the elevator down.

114
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,991
What the hell are you doing here?

115
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:02,044
Planting daisies.
What's it look like?

116
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:03,813
Came in on the case.

117
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:05,443
And you beat me here?

118
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,925
Brains trumps legs, apparently.

119
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:11,081
- You found the game?
- Yep.

120
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:12,749
Did you stop it?

121
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:21,793
Not exactly.

122
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:23,834
What did you do?

123
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,876
I played, okay?

124
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:30,491
And?

125
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:32,861
I lost.

126
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:39,005
Are you killing me?
You played some he-witch?

127
00:08:39,331 --> 00:08:41,895
- don't you take that tone with me.
- You idiot!

128
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,856
They're my years!
I can do what i want!

129
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:45,817
How many did you lose?

130
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:48,987
25.

131
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:58,567
We're not done.

132
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:03,144
You're saying
that you're a mind reader.

133
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:05,180
Come on.
No such thing.

134
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:07,792
But i can read people.

135
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:11,008
Take your lovely companion here.

136
00:09:11,748 --> 00:09:14,646
I'd say, judging
from her exquisite posture,

137
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,076
she used to be a dancer.

138
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,585
Not much of a drinker.

139
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,961
Very independent.

140
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:26,691
Looking for adventure.

141
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:30,409
Hey, man. Excuse me.

142
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:32,631
Can i borrow you for a sec?

143
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,366
Yeah.
Of course. Great.

144
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,437
Good to see you.

145
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:41,373
Would you two please excuse me?

146
00:09:44,252 --> 00:09:47,255
Sorry to cut you short with mr.
And mrs. Easy marks over there.

147
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,482
No big. Wasn't a total loss.

148
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:55,928
I don't know what it is you think
i did to your wife or girlfriend,

149
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:58,333
mother or sister,

150
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,989
but, i just want you
to know, my feelings were real.

151
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,371
That ain't my problem, man-witch.

152
00:10:03,496 --> 00:10:05,106
You owe my friend some years.

153
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:07,499
That's what this is.

154
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:10,609
I'm sorry. He lost.
Them's the breaks.

155
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,722
Then un-lose him.

156
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:19,562
Go ahead and shoot me if
it makes you feel better.

157
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:23,224
Besides, i could use a good...

158
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,684
tickle.

159
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,023
You want years?
Great.

160
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:32,547
- Play me for 'em.
- Fine.

161
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,001
Dean, no!

162
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:36,559
They're my years.
I can do what i want.

163
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:40,399
Lozenge?

164
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:43,902
What?
It's barely linty.

165
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:46,770
Okay, suit yourself.
Just trying to help.

166
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:49,577
All right, all right.
Come on. Let's do this.

167
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,218
You understand the terms?

168
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:07,990
Buy-in's 25 years.

169
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:11,637
Make it 50.

170
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,353
I like the cut of your jib.

171
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:32,918
Lannraich gu dealrach a-nis.

172
00:11:45,628 --> 00:11:48,123
25. That's 25 years.

173
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,512
They go to him.

174
00:11:50,637 --> 00:11:52,544
And he's cashing out.

175
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,442
You sure?

176
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,744
Yes.

177
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,520
Las suas agus cuir ás an teine.

178
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,832
Mar sin bitheadh.

179
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:34,355
That's 25 years
you just pissed away.

180
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,450
Better be sure
you can win them back.

181
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:44,905
Shuffle up and deal.

182
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:51,197
This is gonna be fun.

183
00:12:57,971 --> 00:12:59,747
You find anything?

184
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:01,306
You might say.

185
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:04,752
Who the hell are you?!

186
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:06,487
Dude, relax.

187
00:13:06,612 --> 00:13:08,113
It's me.

188
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:12,355
Hi.

189
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:15,320
What the hell happened?

190
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,289
You know...
found the game.

191
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,603
I thought you said
you were good at poker.

192
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:23,428
I am. Shut up.

193
00:13:23,823 --> 00:13:26,741
You were just gonna shoot
some old guy? Is that it?

194
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:29,277
I didn't know what you were.
I mean, h-have you seen you?

195
00:13:29,402 --> 00:13:30,478
You look like...

196
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:33,040
the old chick in "titanic."
I know. Shut up.

197
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:35,403
I was gonna say "emperor palpatine."

198
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,782
I see you met john mccain there.

199
00:13:44,184 --> 00:13:46,060
Either of you
want to tell me what happened?

200
00:13:46,185 --> 00:13:48,062
Bobby's an idiot.
That's what happened.

201
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:49,797
Nobody asked you to play.

202
00:13:49,922 --> 00:13:51,699
Right. I should have
just let you die.

203
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:53,701
And for damn sure,
nobody asked you to lose!

204
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:56,038
- It's like "grumpy old men."
- Shut up, sam!

205
00:13:56,163 --> 00:13:58,063
What the hell were you thinking?

206
00:13:58,188 --> 00:13:59,296
He's a witch.

207
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:02,340
He's been playing poker
since guys wore tights.

208
00:14:02,702 --> 00:14:05,150
- You just don't get it.
- Yeah, i get it, bobby.

209
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:07,637
You saw a chance to turn
the hands of the clock back

210
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:10,857
and get out
of that damn chair. Pretty tempting.

211
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:14,332
- i can imagine.
- No, you can't.

212
00:14:15,617 --> 00:14:18,456
You got me.
I never been paralyzed.

213
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,861
But i tell you something,
i've been to hell,

214
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,990
and there's an archangel there
wanting me to drop the soap.

215
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,201
Look at me!
My junk's rustier than yours!

216
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,859
- you hear me bellyaching?
- Actually, yeah.

217
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:38,752
I'm having a heart attack.

218
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:41,145
No, you're not.

219
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:44,424
- What is it?
- Acid reflux.

220
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:47,761
Guys your age
can't digest certain foods.

221
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,664
You're gonna need
to put down that cheeseburger.

222
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,231
You want to keep emoting

223
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,527
or you want to talk about solving
this little issue of yours?

224
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,885
It's got to be about the chips.

225
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:10,735
I slid 'em across,

226
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:13,286
patrick did
his little witchy number,

227
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,163
and you prettied up in a hurry.

228
00:15:15,475 --> 00:15:18,124
What are you all thinking?
Some kind of magic chips or something?

229
00:15:18,478 --> 00:15:19,587
Definitely.

230
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,661
- You remember what he chanted?
- Every word.

231
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:24,096
All right, then let's find out
where he stashes his chips.

232
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:26,424
And steal me 50.

233
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:29,457
Benjamin button me
back into burger shape.

234
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:31,890
What do you think?

235
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,726
I think you ought to
put some clothes on.

236
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:43,623
Ready for housekeeping, sir?

237
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,598
Born ready.

238
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,400
You're just like my grandfather.

239
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,042
He hits on anything that moves, too.

240
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,021
You're adorable.

241
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:55,480
And dangerous.

242
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:07,924
Can we just go?

243
00:16:43,996 --> 00:16:47,095
I got to say, i kind of like
the guy.

244
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:30,809
I'm out.

245
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:05,309
Dime-store model.

246
00:19:05,582 --> 00:19:07,660
Piece of cake.

247
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,902
It's like "mission: pathetic."
Watch out.

248
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:26,334
I could have done that.

249
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,779
What are you doing?

250
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,410
Aren't you the chick from the bar?

251
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:38,303
I'm a lot more than that.

252
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,533
It's all right, sweetheart.

253
00:19:42,658 --> 00:19:44,776
They're harmless.

254
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:50,157
You boys want chips?
Take 'em.

255
00:19:50,977 --> 00:19:54,192
They're just chips,
einsteins. It's showmanship.

256
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,947
This may come as a shock,

257
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:58,570
but the magic does not lie
in a pile of crappy plywood

258
00:19:58,816 --> 00:20:01,321
or in any phony abracadabra.

259
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:05,370
It's in the 900-year-old witch.

260
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:08,397
You boys want years?

261
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:10,723
Score 'em the old-fashioned way.

262
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:12,613
Texas hold 'em.

263
00:20:12,738 --> 00:20:14,420
Fine. Let's do it.

264
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:20,802
What card am I holding up?

265
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:25,108
That's what I thought.

266
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,626
If your eyesight's that bad,
what about your memory?

267
00:20:28,365 --> 00:20:29,766
I'm not a murderer.

268
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:33,370
You, on the other hand...

269
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:35,951
No, Sam. Dean...

270
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:38,074
What, Sam not much of a player?

271
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:42,448
Happy trails, Dean.

272
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:45,690
Enjoy the twilight of your life.

273
00:20:47,005 --> 00:20:49,288
Should have taken better care
of that ticker, though.

274
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:54,737
You're free to go.

275
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:02,022
Oh, but, Sam...

276
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:05,308
Your brother's situation.
That's punishment enough,

277
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:07,849
but I can't let you leave

278
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:10,226
Without a small parting gift.

279
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:16,835
What are you doing?

280
00:21:17,147 --> 00:21:18,818
You'll find out soon enough.

281
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,747
Let's get out of here, Sam.

282
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:35,553
Dude...

283
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:38,970
I believe that he-witch
gave you the clap.

284
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:51,229


285
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:55,396
Little help here?

286
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:04,728
You know,
I still think I should play.

287
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,512
You're not good enough.

288
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:10,533
I'm better. Bobby's way better.
We both lost.

289
00:22:10,734 --> 00:22:11,509
Exactly.

290
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,665
So, what?
So I don't get a say in this anymore?

291
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,249
When you get to be our age...

292
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:16,668
You're 30, Dean!

293
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:18,892
I've watched you
hustle plenty of poker.

294
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:21,881
Knowing the game is not enough.
It's not about playing the cards.

295
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,146
It's about playing the other guy.
I know that.

296
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:27,884
Hooray for you.
All i'm saying is, I played this guy.

297
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:29,625
I know his style.
I can take him.

298
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:32,433
No, Bobby. You don't have
enough years in the bank.

299
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:33,532
I got enough.

300
00:22:33,657 --> 00:22:36,789
- No, you'll die if you lose.
- So what if I do?

301
00:22:37,093 --> 00:22:40,163
What exactly am I living for?

302
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:41,985
The damn apocalypse?

303
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:45,200
Watching men die bloody
while I sit in this chair,

304
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:47,003
can't take a step to help'em?

305
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:49,485
No. It's the facts.

306
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,224
I'm old...

307
00:22:53,186 --> 00:22:54,515
And broke down...

308
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,088
and I can't...

309
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:02,883
I ain't a hunter no more.

310
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,839
I'm useless.

311
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,469
And if I wasn't such a coward,

312
00:23:09,984 --> 00:23:13,395
I'd have stuck a gun in my mouth
day I got home from the hospital.

313
00:23:20,641 --> 00:23:23,421
Bobby, you are not playing again.

314
00:23:23,882 --> 00:23:26,268
I'm not... letting you do that.

315
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,475
There's another way out of this.
There's got to be.

316
00:23:29,913 --> 00:23:31,284
And i'm gonna find it.

317
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,820
Take it.

318
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:48,814
It'll help you.

319
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,538
What is this?

320
00:23:55,663 --> 00:23:58,270
The most powerful reversal spell
you've ever laid your eyes on.

321
00:23:59,142 --> 00:24:02,107
- And it reverses what?
- Patrick's work, all of it.

322
00:24:03,173 --> 00:24:04,962
You saying I could be normal again?

323
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:07,254
You and everyone else
he's ever played.

324
00:24:08,284 --> 00:24:09,979
Who's still alive.

325
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,129
Why the hell should we trust you?

326
00:24:13,254 --> 00:24:15,370
Trust me, don't trust me.
I don't care.

327
00:24:15,692 --> 00:24:16,968
The spell is real.

328
00:24:17,093 --> 00:24:20,416
If it zaps everyone,
don't that include your man?

329
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:21,982
And me, too.

330
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:23,961
I look good for my age.

331
00:24:24,287 --> 00:24:26,256
Lady, this don't add up for squat.

332
00:24:27,124 --> 00:24:30,129
- Why would you want that?
- I have my reasons.

333
00:24:34,811 --> 00:24:37,508
Do it quick.
We leave town tomorrow.

334
00:25:07,745 --> 00:25:08,756
Bet.

335
00:25:11,122 --> 00:25:13,928
I sense you've got me
by the jewels on this one, hesh.

336
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:17,135
I fold.

337
00:25:21,993 --> 00:25:24,313
What are you up...
like 13 years there, hesh?

338
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,365
What do you say we call it a day?

339
00:25:30,498 --> 00:25:31,691
Thanks, Patrick.

340
00:25:31,816 --> 00:25:33,135
Hesh here is gonna live

341
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,492
to see his granddaughter's bat mitzvah.
Isn't that right, hesh?

342
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:40,454
- Thanks again, Patrick.
- Shalom, my friend.

343
00:25:47,984 --> 00:25:49,228
That was nice of you.

344
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:51,520
I'm a nice guy.

345
00:25:53,106 --> 00:25:54,302
What can I do you for?

346
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,501
Deal.

347
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:14,363
Jawbone of a murderer.
Great.

348
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,522
You know, this really sucks.

349
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:20,425
How do we even know
her spell's gonna work?

350
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,026
We don't.
But we ain't got a plan "b."

351
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:25,775
Now, less flappin' and more diggin'.

352
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:27,777
Oh, god!

353
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:31,006
My elbows!
I'm all creaky.

354
00:26:31,774 --> 00:26:33,133
Hurry up, you crybaby.

355
00:26:33,462 --> 00:26:35,384
Pound it up your ass, ironsides.

356
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:38,523
One little grave.

357
00:26:40,503 --> 00:26:41,704
Then you do it.

358
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,660
Fine.
I'll hop right in.

359
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:45,186
Well, least your legs are numb.

360
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,510
Shut up and dig, grandma.

361
00:26:48,745 --> 00:26:50,275
Now it's my back!

362
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,758
Can you straighten up?

363
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:54,384
Yeah, but a little sympathy
wouldn't hurt.

364
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:55,750
Butt cheek tingling?

365
00:26:56,464 --> 00:26:58,208
That's kind of personal.

366
00:26:58,779 --> 00:26:59,942
So "yeah"?

367
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,535
It's sciatica. You'll live.
Keep digging.

368
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,698
You know, Bobby...

369
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,749
Killing you is officially
on my bucket list.

370
00:27:10,374 --> 00:27:12,404
I like you, Sam.
I do.

371
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:15,517
You're smart, and your heart's
clearly in the right place.

372
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,134
I can tell a lot about a guy
by looking.

373
00:27:23,164 --> 00:27:25,903
- You mean you're psychic.
- No. That'd be cheating.

374
00:27:26,283 --> 00:27:30,720
I'm talking about
good old-fashioned intuition.

375
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:32,794
Right.
Let's just play.

376
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:34,924
We are playing.

377
00:27:38,043 --> 00:27:39,901
Does your big brother
know you're here?

378
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:43,989
Bet five.

379
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,873
Didn't think so.

380
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:50,286
I raise.

381
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:53,066
Here you are, right...

382
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:57,029
trying to clean up their mess,

383
00:27:57,914 --> 00:28:00,177
And they still want to sit you
at the kiddie table.

384
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:06,673
You're not the little brother
anymore, Sam.

385
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,720
Then again...

386
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:11,222
... maybe you are.

387
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:14,317
You're in over your head here, Sam.

388
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,987
You can keep making these moves...

389
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,213
You know...

390
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,206
Playing it cautious,

391
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:22,993
playing the percentages.

392
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:25,842
But i'm still gonna kick
your ass into the nursing home.

393
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:29,329
Does this armchair-psychology
routine usually work for you?

394
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:32,348
You tell me.

395
00:28:32,473 --> 00:28:34,048
You're the one who's losing.

396
00:29:02,682 --> 00:29:03,574
Little break?

397
00:29:06,357 --> 00:29:07,780
How's it going in there?

398
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:10,319
How do you think it's going?

399
00:29:10,486 --> 00:29:12,456
What about you?
You have everything you need?

400
00:29:12,581 --> 00:29:15,090
We still need a little he-witch DNA.

401
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,089
He was chewing it.
Hurry up. Please.

402
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,296
All right.
Just keep him busy.

403
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:22,160
And, Sammy...

404
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:24,262
Don't lose.

405
00:29:49,868 --> 00:29:53,746
Gairmidh mi air maponus,
dia na hogalachd.

406
00:29:54,871 --> 00:29:59,228
Gairmidh mi air sucellus,
dia na time.

407
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:08,223
Till an-drasda obair uile
gu bheilair a bhith deanta.

408
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,271
Mar sin bitheadh.

409
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,142
Drop it in.

410
00:30:23,726 --> 00:30:24,748
How do I look?

411
00:30:27,602 --> 00:30:28,632
Question...

412
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,538
Is this what you meant
to give your big brother?

413
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:38,452
The one you gave him
never passed my lips.

414
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:40,852
Won't do a scrap of good.

415
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:46,553
I don't like cheating, Sam.

416
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:57,559


417
00:30:58,793 --> 00:31:00,841
Stop it! Patrick, let him go!

418
00:31:00,966 --> 00:31:03,736
- He tried to kill us!
- I did it, I gave him the spell!

419
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:07,532
What?

420
00:31:14,098 --> 00:31:15,166
Why...

421
00:31:15,784 --> 00:31:18,238
- Why would you do that?
- You know why.

422
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:22,670
You know.

423
00:31:39,743 --> 00:31:42,024
Keep... playing.

424
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:49,467
Everything we put
in that spell was kosher.

425
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:52,203
Everything except
the damn toothpick.

426
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,005
You got to go get a speck of DNA.

427
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:56,539
Strap on your track shoes.

428
00:31:56,979 --> 00:31:58,471
Oh, goody.

429
00:31:58,796 --> 00:32:00,098
More stairs.

430
00:32:05,862 --> 00:32:07,485
It's too damn clean in here.

431
00:32:07,652 --> 00:32:08,953
First witch I ever heard of

432
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,001
didn't spew bodily fluids
all over the place.

433
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:13,473
Toothbrush, comb... anything.

434
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:18,561
Look at you...

435
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,014
The percentage player
betting the farm.

436
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:23,399
Awful transparent of you, Sam.

437
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:27,089
If I had a monster hand
like you have,

438
00:32:27,943 --> 00:32:29,502
I'd trap you.

439
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,407
But you get so excited,

440
00:32:31,861 --> 00:32:33,909
you bet yourself
right out of a big pot.

441
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:39,385
I fold.

442
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:42,694
Set of ladies, I'm guessing.

443
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,740
Nice bluff.

444
00:32:57,136 --> 00:32:59,852
If we had time, I could make
a real player out of you.

445
00:33:00,431 --> 00:33:01,570
I got time.

446
00:33:03,855 --> 00:33:04,913
Maybe.

447
00:33:05,591 --> 00:33:07,502
But I can't say the same for Dean.

448
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,106
Your brother's gonna be dead soon.

449
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:13,047
And when I say "soon"...

450
00:33:15,189 --> 00:33:16,994
I mean minutes.

451
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:25,836
The game's not over
still I say it is.

452
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,964
Blinds.

453
00:33:42,858 --> 00:33:45,245
So, when it's about your brother,

454
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,626
You get so emotional,

455
00:33:46,751 --> 00:33:48,886
your brain just flies
right out the window.

456
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:50,987
- Good to know.
- Go to hell.

457
00:33:54,525 --> 00:33:55,567
I'm all-in.

458
00:34:00,031 --> 00:34:02,122
- Don't do that, Sam.
- I can't leave until it's over?

459
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,479
Fine. It's over.

460
00:34:04,914 --> 00:34:06,122
Now, where's my brother?

461
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:08,481
There's poker and then there's suicide.
Just play the hand.

462
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:10,506
Dean?
Dean, you there?

463
00:34:15,318 --> 00:34:16,267
Fine.

464
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,101
Dean?!

465
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:39,646
I'm sorry, kid.

466
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,697
Aces full.

467
00:34:58,573 --> 00:34:59,555
You're crying.

468
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:07,020
For a witch, you're so nice,
it's actually kind of creepy.

469
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:09,946
It's okay.

470
00:35:13,231 --> 00:35:14,709
It was a great hand.

471
00:35:16,655 --> 00:35:17,699
Just...

472
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:21,550
... not as great...

473
00:35:25,483 --> 00:35:26,895
... as four 4s.

474
00:35:40,127 --> 00:35:41,320
Well played.

475
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,896
You know, that whole...

476
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:46,604
Going-out-of-your-head bit...

477
00:35:46,992 --> 00:35:48,280
Very method.

478
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,816
Well, there's more to you
than meets the eye.

479
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,992
Cash these in for Dean, please.

480
00:35:57,882 --> 00:35:58,822
With pleasure.

481
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,450
Dean, you hear me?

482
00:36:02,052 --> 00:36:03,603
Damn it, Dean!

483
00:36:17,368 --> 00:36:18,800
Idjit.

484
00:36:21,575 --> 00:36:22,930
I can't do this.

485
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,066
- Yes, you can.
- Don't make me.

486
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:29,320
I don't want to win.

487
00:36:34,647 --> 00:36:36,383
I buried my daughter.

488
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:38,959
And she looked like this.

489
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,449
It's not natural.

490
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,290
You knew...

491
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:55,812
When you decided to come with me.

492
00:36:58,188 --> 00:37:00,117
This is what you wanted.

493
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,916
You're still young.

494
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,808
You're so beautiful.

495
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,681
- You have me.
- I miss my family.

496
00:37:08,886 --> 00:37:10,060
I'm sorry, Patrick.

497
00:37:11,069 --> 00:37:13,210
- I thought you loved me.
- I do.

498
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,600
Sweetheart, of course I do.

499
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:20,251
I thought I was cut out for this,

500
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:21,349
But i'm not.

501
00:37:21,474 --> 00:37:23,427
I don't think I can do this
without you.

502
00:37:23,684 --> 00:37:26,868
You got on okay for a long time
before you met me.

503
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:32,067
Check.

504
00:37:39,722 --> 00:37:40,956
All-in.

505
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:54,106
All-in.

506
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,612
Thank you.

507
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,793
No tricks...
you actually beat the guy?

508
00:38:36,144 --> 00:38:37,578
How the hell?

509
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,316
Just lucky.

510
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:43,695
- I'll see y'all guys later.
- Where you going?

511
00:38:45,447 --> 00:38:46,749
Nowhere.

512
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:52,678
- A booster shot.
- Don't say it.

513
00:38:56,964 --> 00:38:59,799
I guess, we can get the van loaded.

514
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,012
I shouldn't have
called you an idiot.

515
00:39:06,947 --> 00:39:08,439
Which time?

516
00:39:09,677 --> 00:39:11,114
I'm sorry.

517
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:13,500
I mean, I actually...

518
00:39:13,914 --> 00:39:15,012
I get it.

519
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:18,432
Getting old ain't a bachelor party.

520
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,080
And dealing with the crap
you got to deal with...

521
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:23,497
- Don't you go on pity patrol.
- I'm not.

522
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:25,449
I'm not. I'm just...

523
00:39:26,342 --> 00:39:28,217
I'm saying, you know,
if I was in your shoes...

524
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:30,325
You'd never stop complaining.

525
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:34,717
Fair enough.

526
00:39:37,186 --> 00:39:38,792
You're not useless, Bobby.

527
00:39:41,694 --> 00:39:42,563
Good talk.

528
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:44,589
No, wait a minute.
Listen to me.

529
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,599
You don't stop being a soldier

530
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:57,460
'cause you got wounded in battle.

531
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,111
No matter what shape you're in,

532
00:40:01,236 --> 00:40:03,349
bottom line is, you're family.

533
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,723
I don't know if you've noticed,
but me and Sam,

534
00:40:05,848 --> 00:40:07,154
we don't have much left.

535
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:11,783
I can't do this without you.

536
00:40:13,762 --> 00:40:14,728
I can't.

537
00:40:16,644 --> 00:40:20,257
So don't you dare
think about checking out.

538
00:40:20,966 --> 00:40:22,959
I don't want to hear that again.

539
00:40:33,991 --> 00:40:34,873
Good.

540
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:42,351
Thanks.

541
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:46,258
Now, we done feeling our feelings?
'cause i'd like to get out of this room

542
00:40:46,383 --> 00:40:48,320
before we both start
growing lady parts.

543
00:40:50,052 --> 00:40:51,449
Yeah, we're done.

544
00:41:04,603 --> 00:41:06,294
Let's go, ironsides.

545
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:08,529
That one's sticking?
