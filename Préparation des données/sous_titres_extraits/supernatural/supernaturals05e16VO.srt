1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:04,802
Come on, how many times
have you two died, anyway?

2
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:19,560
There is someone besides Michael
strong enough to take on Lucifer.

3
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,187
- Who's that?
- God.

4
00:00:22,312 --> 00:00:23,591
I'm gonna find God.

5
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:25,351
- What is it you want?
- An amulet.

6
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:28,027
It burns hot in God's presence.
It'll help me find him.

7
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,695
- I got nothing like that.
- You don't.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,500
What is it?

9
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,327
Bobby gave it to me.
Said it was special.

10
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,828
Thank you, Sam, I love it.

11
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,500
- May I borrow it?
- No.

12
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,168
Dean, give it to me.

13
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:45,813
Don't lose it.

14
00:01:01,784 --> 00:01:03,134
Looking for this?

15
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:13,692
- Mornin'.
- Shut up.

16
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:15,461
Hands where I can see 'em.

17
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:20,324
Wait a minute.

18
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:23,958
Is that you, Roy?

19
00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:27,655
It is, isn't it?

20
00:01:28,378 --> 00:01:29,928
Which makes you Walt.

21
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:35,136
Don't matter.

22
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,876
Is it just me
or do you two seem upset?

23
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:42,560
You think you can flip the switch
on the apocalypse

24
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,199
and just walk away, Sam?

25
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,857
- Who told you that?
- We ain't the only hunters after you.

26
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:53,237
- See you in the next life.
- Hear me out. I can explain, okay?

27
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:56,047
Please.

28
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:05,124
Stay the hell down.

29
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,337
Shoot him.

30
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:12,745
Killing Sam was right,
but Dean...

31
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,970
He made us, 
and we snuffed his brother, you idiot.

32
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:19,561
You wanna spend the rest of your life
knowing Dean's on your ass?

33
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:20,936
'cause I don't.

34
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Shoot him.

35
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,999
Go ahead, Roy, do it.

36
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,069
But I'm gonna warn you.

37
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,687
When I come back...

38
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:38,368
I'm gonna be pissed.

39
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:43,256
Come on!

40
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,379
Let's get this show on the road.

41
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:51,399
Come on, already.

42
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,710
Come on, let's go!

43
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,220
Weird dream.

44
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:43,345
Got your lighter?

45
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:48,644
- I haven't seen this in years.
- Fire 'em up.

46
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:00,197
I remember this.

47
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:04,315
That's 4th of July, 1996.

48
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:10,866
Dad would never let us
do anything like this.

49
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:13,896
Thanks, Dean, this is great.

50
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:31,654
Fire in the hole!

51
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:32,056
It's me.

52
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:39,637
Stop poking around in my dreams.

53
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:40,947
I need some "me" time.

54
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:42,222
Listen to me.

55
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:44,108
This isn't a dream.

56
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:48,222
- Then what is it?
- Deep down, you already know.

57
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:04,743
I'm dead.

58
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:06,169
Condolences.

59
00:06:08,523 --> 00:06:09,952
- Where am I?
- Heaven.

60
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:12,991
Heaven?

61
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:17,543
- How did I get to heaven?
- Please, listen.

62
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,668
This spell, this connection...

63
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,814
It's difficult to maintain.

64
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:23,389
If I'm in heaven...

65
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:27,258
- Then where's Sam?
- What do you see?

66
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:29,550
What do you mean?

67
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:31,505
Some people see a tunnel or a river.

68
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,706
What do you see?

69
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:35,198
Nothing. My dash.
I'm in my car. I'm on a road.

70
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:37,813
All right... A road.
For you, it's a road.

71
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,681
Follow it, Dean. You'll find Sam.
Follow...

72
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:42,547
Road.

73
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,069
Thank you.

74
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:17,881
So, Sam...

75
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:20,273
I hear you're new to McKinley.

76
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,940
Yes, sir, two weeks.

77
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:25,254
Stephanie over here
can't seem to stop talking about you.

78
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,529
Dad, shut up!

79
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:42,931
What are you doing
in my dream?

80
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:45,942
What does your father do
for a living?

81
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:49,308
You don't say!

82
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Heaven?

83
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,222
How are we in heaven?

84
00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:58,192
All that clean living, I guess.

85
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:02,141
You, I get. Sure.

86
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:04,018
But me?

87
00:08:04,143 --> 00:08:05,927
Maybe you haven't noticed, but...

88
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,289
I've done a few things.

89
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:10,178
You thought
you were doing the right thing.

90
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:13,266
Last I checked the road to heaven
wasn't paved with good intentions.

91
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:15,610
If this is the skymall, it sucks.

92
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:17,782
Where's the triplets and the latex,
you know?

93
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:19,081
A guy has needs.

94
00:08:23,593 --> 00:08:26,729
When you bite dust, they say
your life flashes before your eyes.

95
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,058
Your point?

96
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:30,425
This house...
It's one of my memories.

97
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:34,287
When I woke up, I woke up
in one of my memories.

98
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,883
The 4th of July
that we burned down that field.

99
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:40,936
Maybe that's heaven.
Where you relive your greatest hits.

100
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:43,910
So, playing footsie
with brace-face in there,

101
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:45,567
That's a trophy moment for you?

102
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,986
I was 11 years old.
This was my first real Thanksgiving.

103
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:51,499
We had thanksgiving every year.

104
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:55,492
We had a bucket of extra-crispy,
and dad passed out on the couch.

105
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,746
I don't remember this.

106
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,962
- We should...
- Yeah, definitely.

107
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:31,028
What the hell was that?

108
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,795
I don't know, but we are taking
the escalator back downstairs.

109
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:39,230
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like?

110
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:40,731
Like you've lost your mind.

111
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:44,432
Cass talked to me before using
this "phone home" radio thing, so I...

112
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,543
I can hear you.

113
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:53,106
So, I found Sam,
b- but something happened.

114
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:56,341
- There was this weird beam of light...
- Don't go into the light.

115
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:57,930
Thanks... Carol-Anne.

116
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:00,005
- What was it?
- Not what, who.

117
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,151
Zachariah. He's searching for you.

118
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:03,310
If he finds us?

119
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,904
You can't say yes
to Michael and Lucifer if you're dead,

120
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:07,968
Zachariah needs to return you
to your bodies.

121
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:09,340
Great. Problem solved.

122
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:10,939
You don't understand.

123
00:10:11,064 --> 00:10:13,820
You're behind the wall.
This is a rare opportunity.

124
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,907
- For what?
- You need to find the angel Joshua.

125
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:20,057
Man, no offense,
but we are ass-full of angels.

126
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:21,815
- You find him.
- I can't.

127
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,247
I can't return to heaven.

128
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,855
What's so important about Joshua?

129
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,303
The rumor is, he talks to God.

130
00:10:30,702 --> 00:10:31,702
And? So?

131
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:34,358
You think maybe, just maybe,
we should find out

132
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:35,842
what God has been saying?

133
00:10:37,142 --> 00:10:38,292
Geez. Touchy.

134
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:40,681
Please.
I just need you to follow the road.

135
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,446
- What road?
- It's called the axis mundi.

136
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:46,306
It's a path that runs through heaven.
People see different things.

137
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:48,023
For you, it's two-lane asphalt.

138
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,191
The road will lead you to the garden.
You'll find Joshua there.

139
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,884
And Joshua...

140
00:10:53,507 --> 00:10:54,736
Can take us to God.

141
00:10:56,352 --> 00:10:57,322
The garden.

142
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,574
Please, hurry.

143
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:07,374
What do you think?

144
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:09,906
We hit the yellow bricks,
find this Joshua cat.

145
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,003
Really?

146
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,297
You don't?

147
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:15,215
I'm just surprised you do.

148
00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:18,218
You wanted to break God's nose.
Now you think He can help?

149
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,720
He's the only one who can.

150
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,806
Sam, we are royally boned.

151
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,224
So, prayer...

152
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:27,048
A last hope of a desperate man.

153
00:11:34,747 --> 00:11:36,528
Wasn't there a street out here?

154
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,021
There was.

155
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:48,377
- What are you doing?
- Looking for a road.

156
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,251
You think the road is in a closet?

157
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:54,403
We're in heaven, Sam, okay?

158
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:56,506
Our memories are coming true,
Cass is on TV.

159
00:11:56,778 --> 00:11:58,691
Finding a road in a closet
would be

160
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,107
the most normal thing
to happen to us today.

161
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:05,201
What?

162
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:08,268
I used to have one of these.

163
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:10,310
When I was a kid.

164
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,919
That was the road?

165
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,826
I guess.

166
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:31,637
Pretty trippy, right?

167
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:34,805
More trippy...

168
00:12:35,514 --> 00:12:36,664
Apparently...

169
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,296
You "wuv hugz."

170
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:42,307
Shut up.

171
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:48,463
I know where we are.

172
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:50,851
Where?

173
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:54,469
We're home.

174
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:00,431
You hungry?

175
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,036


176
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:16,657
You want the crusts cut off?

177
00:13:18,304 --> 00:13:19,464
I'd love that.

178
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,340
Mom?

179
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,889
I guess it's not your memory, Sam.
Sorry.

180
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,562
We should... Go.

181
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,535
Keep looking for the road.

182
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,065
Just give me a minute.

183
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,894
Please, one minute.

184
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,708
No, John.

1
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:56,835
We're not having
this conversation again.

2
00:13:57,817 --> 00:13:59,667
Time to think?
About what?

3
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:01,756
You have two boys at home.

4
00:14:03,536 --> 00:14:04,836
I remember this.

5
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,265
Mom and dad were fighting,
and then he moved out for a couple days.

6
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,775
Dad always said
they had the perfect marriage.

7
00:14:11,878 --> 00:14:14,561
- It wasn't until after she died.
- Fine. Then don't.

8
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:17,727
There's nothing more to talk about.

9
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,190
What happens next?

10
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:31,227
It's okay, mom.

11
00:14:33,536 --> 00:14:34,873
Dad still loves you.

12
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,301
I love you, too.

13
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:41,192
I'll never leave you.

14
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:48,299
You are my little angel.

15
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,098
How about some pie?

16
00:15:02,224 --> 00:15:03,224
What?

17
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:09,199
I just never realized how long
you've been cleaning up dad's messes.

18
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:13,626
Let's keep moving.

19
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:33,801
I've seen this before.

20
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:37,178
Where?

21
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:45,151
Where are we?

22
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:47,705
No way.

23
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,615
Bones! Come here!

24
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:54,549
Bones?

25
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:56,765
Bones was my dog.

26
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,525
Your dog?

27
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:05,395
Is this flagstaff?

28
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,467
This is a good memory for you?

29
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:13,305
I was on my own for two weeks.
I lived off of funyuns and Mr. Pibb.

30
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:18,561
- What?
- You don't remember?

31
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,220
You ran away on my watch.

32
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,628
I looked everywhere for you.

33
00:16:24,753 --> 00:16:26,234
I thought you were dead.

34
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:28,109
And when dad came home...

35
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:37,968
Dean, I'm sorry.

36
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:39,840
I never thought about it like that.

37
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,565
Forget it. Let's roll.

38
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,700
Stay.

39
00:16:58,431 --> 00:16:59,581
Bonesy, stay.

40
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:18,017
What memory is this?

41
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:20,451
No idea.

42
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:22,123
All right. Come on.

43
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:25,203
Road, God.

44
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:26,934
Remember?

45
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:28,415
Wait a minute.

46
00:17:32,646 --> 00:17:33,646
This?

47
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:38,228
This is the night you ditched us
for Stanford.

48
00:17:39,722 --> 00:17:41,622
This is your idea of heaven?

49
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,147
This was one of the worst nights
of my life.

50
00:17:46,438 --> 00:17:48,238
I can't control this stuff.

51
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:49,363
Seriously?

52
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:52,028
This is a happy memory for you?

53
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,499
I was on my own.

54
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:56,677
- I finally got away from dad.
- Not the only one you got away from.

55
00:17:57,807 --> 00:17:59,607
Dean, I'm sorry. I just...

56
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:02,899
I know...
You didn't think of it like that.

57
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:06,905
Your heaven
is somebody else's thanksgiving.

58
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:10,714
It's bailing on your family.
What do you want me to say?

59
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:13,017
Look, man...

60
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:15,763
I never got the crusts
cut off my PB&J.

61
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:20,348
- I don't look at family the way you do.
- But I'm your family.

62
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:24,018
We're supposed to be a team.
You and me against the world.

63
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,162
Dean... It is.

64
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:31,219
Is it?

65
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:34,911
Go! Go! Go!

66
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,486
Running from angels...

67
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,130
On foot...

68
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:02,213
In heaven.

69
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:05,410
With out-of-the-box thinking
like that,

70
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:08,295
I'm surprised you
haven't stopped the apocalypse already.

71
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:14,085
Guys, what's the problem?

72
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:17,645
I just want to send you back to earth.
That's all.

73
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:19,115
I mean, that is,

74
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,755
after I tear you
a cosmos of new ones.

75
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,980
You're on my turf now, boys.

76
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:29,459
By the time I'm through with you,
you're gonna be begging

77
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,210
to say yes.

78
00:19:39,018 --> 00:19:40,078
Guys, come on.

79
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:42,253
You can run, but you can't run.

80
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:52,409
Hurry! This way!

81
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,700
Wait... Who are you?

82
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:13,002
Buenos días, bitches.

83
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:15,454
Ash?

84
00:20:17,206 --> 00:20:19,006
Welcome to my blue heaven.

85
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:28,095


86
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:31,898
God... The Roadhouse.
Even smells the same.

87
00:20:32,434 --> 00:20:33,987
Bud, blood, and beer nuts...

88
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:36,001
It's the best smell in the world.

89
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:38,236
How about a cold one?

90
00:20:39,214 --> 00:20:40,214
Up here,

91
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:41,556
no hangover.

92
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:45,745
No offense...

93
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,246
How's a dirtbag like me
end up in a place like this?

94
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,358
I been saved, man.

95
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,604
I was my congregation's
number-one snake handler.

96
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:54,627
And you said this was your heaven?

97
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:57,264
My own... Personal.

98
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,214
And when the angels jumped us,
we were...

99
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:11,301
- In your heaven.
- So there are two heavens?

100
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:12,604
More like 100 billion.

101
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,377
So, no worries.

102
00:21:14,502 --> 00:21:17,452
It'll take them angel boys
a minute to catch up.

103
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:23,556
See, you got to stop thinking
of heaven as one place.

104
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:27,493
It's more like a buttload of places
all crammed together.

105
00:21:28,757 --> 00:21:31,873
Like Disneyland,
except without all the antisemitism.

106
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:34,296
Disneyland?

107
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,753
See, you got Winchesterland...

108
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:38,883
Ashland...

109
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:42,301
A whole mess
of everybody-else-lands.

110
00:21:42,585 --> 00:21:45,366
Put 'em all together...
Heaven, right?

111
00:21:46,017 --> 00:21:48,917
At the center of it all
is the magic kingdom...

112
00:21:49,493 --> 00:21:50,543
The garden.

113
00:21:51,683 --> 00:21:54,431
- Everybody gets a slice of paradise?
- Pretty much.

114
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,357
Few people share... Special cases.

115
00:21:57,611 --> 00:21:58,942
- Whatnot.
- Special?

116
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,225
You know, like...

117
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:03,899
Soul mates.

118
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:09,597
Anyways...

119
00:22:09,722 --> 00:22:12,309
Most people
can't leave their own private Idahos.

120
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:15,333
- But you ain't most people.
- Nope. They ain't got my skills.

121
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,990
Hell, I have been all over...

122
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,964
Johnny Cash...
André the giant...

123
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:23,519
Einstein.

124
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:26,552
Sam, that man
can mix a White Russian.

125
00:22:27,198 --> 00:22:30,348
Hell, the other day,
I found Mallanaga Vatsyayana's.

126
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,892
- Who?
- Wrote the Kama Sutra.

127
00:22:33,678 --> 00:22:36,813
That boy's heaven...
Oh, sweaty, confusing.

128
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,148
From a guy who used to sleep
on a pool table.

129
00:22:39,454 --> 00:22:41,275
Now that I'm dead,
I'm livin', man...

130
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,743
- A whole lot more.
- How'd you find us?

131
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:46,030
I rigged up my very own...

132
00:22:46,803 --> 00:22:48,703
Holy rollin' police scanner.

133
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:56,327
That's angels,
blabbin' Enochian, okay?

134
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:57,957
I'm fluent.

135
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:01,504
I heard that you were up.

136
00:23:01,942 --> 00:23:04,298
Course I had to come find you...
Again.

137
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:08,928
- Again?
- Ain't the first time you been here.

138
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,682
I mean, you boys die
more than anyone I have ever met.

139
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:15,666
Really?

140
00:23:17,233 --> 00:23:18,438
You don't remember.

141
00:23:18,612 --> 00:23:21,024
God! Angels...
Must have windexed your brains.

142
00:23:21,576 --> 00:23:23,767
So, have you found anybody else?

143
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:25,234
Ellen and Jo?

144
00:23:26,577 --> 00:23:27,905
Ellen and Jo are dead?

145
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,360
A few months now.

146
00:23:36,964 --> 00:23:37,964
I'm sorry.

147
00:23:42,228 --> 00:23:43,928
They went down fightin'?

148
00:23:46,328 --> 00:23:47,378
To the end.

149
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,811
A lot of good it did.

150
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:52,889
How about our folks?

151
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:56,309
Been lookin' all over
for John Winchester.

152
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:57,477
Mary too.

153
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,270
So far, nada.

154
00:24:00,011 --> 00:24:01,011
I'm sorry.

155
00:24:02,555 --> 00:24:04,025
There is somebody

156
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,455
who I know for sure
wants to jaw with you.

157
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,580
Hold up.

158
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:15,495
Pamela.

159
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:17,816
Nice to see you boys again.

160
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:25,096
- This is how you get around up here?
- More or less.

161
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:27,110
It's just awesome to finally have

162
00:24:27,235 --> 00:24:29,550
a practical application
for string theory.

163
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:38,184
That's for getting me killed.

164
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:44,048
That's probably less than I deserve.

165
00:24:45,022 --> 00:24:47,301
If it makes you feel any better,
we got Ash killed, too.

166
00:24:47,426 --> 00:24:49,976
- I'm cool with it.
- He's cool with it.

167
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:55,034
- Are you good?
- I'm good.

168
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:58,863
Really.

169
00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:01,865
Remember my death scene?

170
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,742
Gutshot, coughing blood?

171
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:05,711
You told me
I was going someplace better.

172
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:08,278
- I was lying.
- You were right.

173
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:12,117
My heaven... It is one long show
at the meadowland.

174
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:13,453
It's amazing.

175
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:15,195
You should see it.

176
00:25:19,057 --> 00:25:20,607
You don't believe me.

177
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,494
No, I do. It's just, you know...

178
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:26,733
Spending eternity trapped
in your own little universe

179
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,068
while the angels run the show,
that's lonely.

180
00:25:29,877 --> 00:25:31,338
You know, that's not Nirvana.

181
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,406
- That's the matrix.
- I don't know.

182
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,868
Attic's still better
than the basement.

183
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:41,747
This place...

184
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:44,542
It feels real, but it's memorex.

185
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:48,292
- Real is down there.
- Well, close enough.

186
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,940
Look, Dean, I'm happy.

187
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:56,888
- I'm at peace.
- You trying to sell me a timeshare?

188
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,656
What's with the pitch?

189
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:02,539
I know Michael wants to take you out
for a test drive.

190
00:26:02,664 --> 00:26:04,061
- Pamela...
- Just saying.

191
00:26:04,444 --> 00:26:07,044
What happens
if you play ball with him...

192
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:09,101
- Worst case?
- A lot of people die.

193
00:26:09,226 --> 00:26:11,976
And then they come here.
That really so bad?

194
00:26:17,146 --> 00:26:18,146
Look...

195
00:26:18,271 --> 00:26:19,271
Maybe

196
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:22,126
you don't have to fight it so hard.

197
00:26:23,177 --> 00:26:24,665
That's all I'm trying to say.

198
00:26:28,474 --> 00:26:30,207
Found a shortcut to the garden.

199
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,026
All-access pass
to the magic kingdom.

200
00:26:38,224 --> 00:26:39,224
Good.

201
00:26:41,094 --> 00:26:44,959
- Not good?
- Zach's gonna be watching every road.

202
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,250
So watch your ass.

203
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,035
Just how I imagined.

204
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:28,522
Gentlemen.

205
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,714
I don't mean to be a downer
or anything, but...

206
00:27:32,093 --> 00:27:34,243
I'm sure I'll see you again soon.

207
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,373
Keep a sixer on ice for us.

208
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,050
- Why are we back home?
- I don't know.

209
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:02,841
- What are we gonna do?
- Keep looking for the road, I guess.

210
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,199
Honey? Why are you up?

211
00:28:08,543 --> 00:28:09,843
Look, I'm sorry.

212
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:12,068
I love you. But you're not real.

213
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:15,985
- And we don't have time.
- Did you have a nightmare?

214
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,270
Tell me.

215
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,430
I gotta go.

216
00:28:20,675 --> 00:28:22,992
Then how about I tell you
my nightmare, Dean?

217
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:25,841
The night I burned.

218
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,890
- Sammy, let's get out of here.
- Don't you walk away from me.

219
00:28:41,226 --> 00:28:42,303
I never loved you.

220
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:45,014
You were my burden.

221
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:48,029
I was shackled to you.

222
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:52,284
Look what it got me.

223
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:58,469


224
00:29:18,986 --> 00:29:20,686
The worst was the smell.

225
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:23,386
The pain, well...

226
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,903
What can you say
about your skin bubbling off?

227
00:29:28,945 --> 00:29:30,095
But the smell

228
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:31,955
was so...

229
00:29:33,747 --> 00:29:36,440
For a second, I thought
I left a pot roast burning in the oven.

230
00:29:40,215 --> 00:29:41,215
But...

231
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,947
It was my meat.

232
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:46,920
And then, finally, I was dead.

233
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:50,098
The one silver lining...

234
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:53,774
Is that at least
I was away from you.

235
00:29:58,272 --> 00:30:00,822
Everybody leaves you, Dean.
You noticed?

236
00:30:01,804 --> 00:30:02,804
Mommy...

237
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:04,185
Daddy.

238
00:30:05,758 --> 00:30:06,758
Even Sam.

239
00:30:09,716 --> 00:30:11,225
Ever ask yourself why?

240
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:14,589
Maybe it's not them.

241
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,930
Maybe...

242
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,870
It's you.

243
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,880
Easy, now, kitten.

244
00:30:27,484 --> 00:30:28,634
You did this.

245
00:30:28,921 --> 00:30:30,501
I'm just getting started.

246
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:32,965
Did you really think
you could sneak past me

247
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,415
into mission control?

248
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,754
You son of a bitch.

249
00:30:36,557 --> 00:30:38,636
I'd say the same thing about you,
Sam,

250
00:30:38,761 --> 00:30:42,306
but I have actually grown
quite fond of your mother.

251
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,433
Or, at least,
the blessed memory of her.

252
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,552
I think we're gonna be logging
a lot of quality time together.

253
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:58,845
I've discovered she's quite the...

254
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:59,970
Milf.

255
00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:02,045
Gloat all you want, you dick.

256
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,527
You're still bald.

257
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,448
In heaven, I have six wings
and four faces, one of which is a lion.

258
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:10,836
You see this because you're...

259
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:17,454
Limited.

260
00:31:22,978 --> 00:31:24,673
Let's brass-tack this, shall we?

261
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,752
You're gonna ball-gag us
until we say yes?

262
00:31:26,877 --> 00:31:28,344
I've heard that tune.

263
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,763
I'm gonna do a lot more than that.

264
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,672
I've cleared my schedule.
Get him up.

265
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,782
Let me tell you something.

266
00:31:36,907 --> 00:31:38,857
I was on the fast track once.

267
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:41,857
Employee of the month
every month, forever.

268
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:44,652
I'd walk these halls,
and people would avert their eyes!

269
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,020
I had respect!

270
00:31:51,763 --> 00:31:53,763
And then they assigned me you.

271
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:57,888
Now look at me.

272
00:31:59,544 --> 00:32:03,443
I can't close the deal on a couple
of pathetic, flannel-wearing maggots?

273
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:05,381
Everybody's laughing at me.

274
00:32:08,457 --> 00:32:09,984
And they're right to do it.

275
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:12,059
So... Say yes, don't say yes.

276
00:32:12,184 --> 00:32:14,390
I'm still gonna take it out
of your asses.

277
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,370
It's personal now, boys.

278
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,969
And the last person
in the history of creation

279
00:32:20,094 --> 00:32:21,772
you want as your enemy is me.

280
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:26,305
And I'll tell you why...
Lucifer may be strong,

281
00:32:27,954 --> 00:32:28,954
but I'm...

282
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:30,645
Petty.

283
00:32:32,691 --> 00:32:35,551
I'm gonna be the angel on your shoulder
for the rest of eternity.

284
00:32:35,676 --> 00:32:37,435
Excuse me, sir?

285
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,982
- I'm in a meeting.
- I'm sorry.

286
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,751
I need to speak to those two.

287
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:49,249
- Excuse me?
- It's a bad time, I know.

288
00:32:50,244 --> 00:32:52,344
But I'm afraid I have to insist.

289
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,515
- You don't get to insist jack squat.
- No, you're right.

290
00:32:56,778 --> 00:32:58,178
But the boss does.

291
00:32:58,531 --> 00:32:59,560
His orders.

292
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:05,566
- You're lying.
- Wouldn't lie about this.

293
00:33:06,372 --> 00:33:08,595
Look... Fire me, if you want.

294
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:11,901
Sooner or later,
He's gonna come back home.

295
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:16,170
And you know how He is
with that whole "wrath" thing.

296
00:33:43,017 --> 00:33:44,017
This is...

297
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:46,509
Heaven's garden?

298
00:33:48,516 --> 00:33:49,866
It's nice... ish.

299
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:51,762
I guess.

300
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:55,169
You see what you want to here.

301
00:33:56,317 --> 00:33:58,275
For some, it's God's throne room.

302
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,000
For others, it's eden.

303
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,171
You two, I believe

304
00:34:02,296 --> 00:34:05,317
it's the Cleveland
botanical gardens.

305
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,378
You came here on a field trip.

306
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:13,222
- You're Joshua.
- I'm Joshua.

307
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:15,871
So, you...

308
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:19,598
- Talk to God?
- Mostly, He talks to me.

309
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:24,770
We need to speak to Him.
It's important.

310
00:34:25,323 --> 00:34:27,173
- Where is He?
- On earth.

311
00:34:28,292 --> 00:34:30,216
- Doing what?
- I don't know.

312
00:34:30,341 --> 00:34:32,736
- Do you know where on earth?
- No. Sorry.

313
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,988
We don't exactly speak face-to-face.

314
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,390
I'm sorry. I don't get it.

315
00:34:38,515 --> 00:34:41,203
- God's not talking to nobody, so...
- So why is He talking to me?

316
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:45,214
I sometimes think it's because
I can sympathize...

317
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:47,828
Gardener to gardener.

318
00:34:48,078 --> 00:34:51,394
And between us,
I think He gets lonely.

319
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,704
My heart's breaking for Him.

320
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:57,613
Can you at least
get him a message for us?

321
00:34:57,738 --> 00:35:00,018
Actually, he has a message for you.

322
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:02,633
Back off.

323
00:35:03,897 --> 00:35:04,897
What?

324
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:07,604
He knows already...
Everything you want to tell him.

325
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,898
He knows what the angels are doing.

326
00:35:10,372 --> 00:35:12,641
He knows that the apocalypse
has begun.

327
00:35:13,004 --> 00:35:15,487
He just doesn't think
it's His problem.

328
00:35:16,752 --> 00:35:19,440
- Not His problem?
- God saved you already.

329
00:35:19,565 --> 00:35:21,315
He put you on that plane.

330
00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:23,394
He brought back Castiel.

331
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:26,096
He granted you salvation in heaven.

332
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:28,933
And after everything
you've done, too.

333
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:33,117
It's more than He's intervened
in a long time.

334
00:35:35,262 --> 00:35:36,462
He's finished.

335
00:35:37,284 --> 00:35:40,384
Magic amulet or not,
you won't be able to find Him.

336
00:35:41,033 --> 00:35:43,463
But He can stop it.
He could stop all of it.

337
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:45,559
I suppose He could, but He won't.

338
00:35:46,183 --> 00:35:48,533
- Why not?
- Why does He allow evil?

339
00:35:49,466 --> 00:35:51,690
You could go nuts
asking questions like that.

340
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:54,669
He's just gonna sit back
and watch the world burn?

341
00:35:54,794 --> 00:35:57,494
I know how important
this was to you, Dean.

342
00:35:58,111 --> 00:35:59,111
I'm sorry.

343
00:36:00,496 --> 00:36:01,496
Forget it.

344
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:05,698
Just another deadbeat dad
with a bunch of excuses.

345
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,556
I'm used to that.

346
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:11,581
- I'll muddle through.
- Except...

347
00:36:12,331 --> 00:36:14,631
You don't know if you can this time.

348
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:18,608
You can't kill the devil.

349
00:36:19,388 --> 00:36:21,188
And you're losing faith...

350
00:36:21,545 --> 00:36:25,201
In yourself, your brother,
and now this.

351
00:36:25,907 --> 00:36:27,557
God was your last hope.

352
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:29,101
I just...

353
00:36:30,404 --> 00:36:33,154
I wish I could tell you
something different.

354
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,193
How do we know
you're telling the truth?

355
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,311
- You think that I would lie?
- But it's just...

356
00:36:39,702 --> 00:36:43,075
- You're not the first angel we've met.
- I'm rooting for you boys.

357
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:45,861
I wish I could do more to help you.
I do.

358
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:47,167
But...

359
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,589
I just trim the hedges.

360
00:36:51,782 --> 00:36:52,932
So, what now?

361
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,239
You go home again.

362
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:57,448
I'm afraid this time

363
00:36:59,078 --> 00:37:00,728
won't be like the last.

364
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,141
This time...

365
00:37:04,487 --> 00:37:05,787
God wants you...

366
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:08,961
To remember.

367
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,402


368
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,800
You all right?

369
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:41,884
Define all right.

370
00:38:02,441 --> 00:38:03,441
Maybe...

371
00:38:05,482 --> 00:38:07,132
Maybe Joshua was lying.

372
00:38:11,902 --> 00:38:14,352
I don't think he was, Cass.
I'm sorry.

373
00:38:27,301 --> 00:38:28,751
You son of a bitch.

374
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:31,593
I believed in...

375
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,753
I don't need this anymore.

376
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:02,339
It's worthless.

377
00:39:04,794 --> 00:39:05,794
Wait.

378
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,185
We'll find another way.

379
00:39:16,342 --> 00:39:18,992
- We can still stop all this, Dean.
- How?

380
00:39:20,477 --> 00:39:22,401
I don't know. But we'll find it.

381
00:39:23,647 --> 00:39:24,697
You and me.

382
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,613
We'll find it.
