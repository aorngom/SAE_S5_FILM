1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,200
look, dad's gone now.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,900
we have to carry out his legacy,

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,400
and that means hunting down
as many evil sons of bitches
as we possibly can.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,700
then

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,500
did i die?

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,200
did you sell your soul for me?

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
how long do you get?

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,200
one year.

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,500
you shouldn't have
done that.

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,700
<i>i guess i got to save your ass
for a change.</i>

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
what kind of blade
can kill a demon?

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,200
yesterday, i would have
said there was no such thing.

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,600
who was that masked chick?

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,600
you ever run across a guy
named gordon walker?

15
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,200
he is dangerous to everyone
and everything around him.

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,200
this demon tells me
they have soldiers

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,000
to fight in this coming war

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,900
humans fighting on hell's side.

19
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,900
i know about sam's visions.

20
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,200
i know everything,
and your brother's fair game.

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,100
aah!

22
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,900
gordon should be reaching for the soap
for the next few years, at least.

23
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,500
tell me who you are!

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,900
you're a demon.

25
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,700
i'm here

26
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,900
because i want to help you.

27
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,300
<i>what could you possibly --</i>

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,300
i can help you
save your brother.

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,400
now

33
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,700
it's true.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,300
the devil's gate
was opened in wyoming.

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
big...

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,500
st. helens big.

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,800
there's no solid fix
on how many demons got out,

38
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,800
but it's in the hundreds --
an army.

39
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,800
sam winchester was there,

40
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,800
wasn't he?

41
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,500
talked to a guy who knows guy
who knows bobby singer,

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,100
and, yeah, looks like the
winchesters were at ground zero

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,500
when the gate was popped.

44
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,400
but singer said
they went in there to stop it.

45
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
mnh-mnh.

46
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,500
bobby's edge
ain't what it used to be.

47
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,700
sam could have him believing
anything by now.

48
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,700
listen, gordon.

49
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,200
as far as talk goes,

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,800
sam winchester checks out.

51
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,000
he's a hunter. that's all.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,800
that's all?

53
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,600
kubrick...

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,100
i'm not even sure
he's human.

55
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
think i'm crazy?

56
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,400
i told you there was a war coming

57
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,500
six months ago.

58
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,200
take a look around.

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,900
it's here.

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,700
now i'm telling you this boy
is a part of it.

61
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,300
track him down, kubrick.

62
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,300
you'll come to see it, too.

63
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,200
sam winchester must die.

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
because demon,
that's why.

65
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,700
i mean, the second you find out
this ruby chick is a demon,

66
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,000
you go for the holy water.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,200
- you don't chat.
- no one was chatting, dean.

68
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,100
oh, yeah? then why didn't
you send her ass back to hell?

69
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,900
because -- because she said she
might be able to help us out.

70
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,700
how?

71
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,800
<i>oh, really, sam? how?
how could she possibly help us?</i>

72
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
<i>she told me
she could help you, okay?</i>

73
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,100
help you
out of the crossroads deal.

74
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,700
what's wrong with you, huh?
she's lying.

75
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,300
you got to know that,
don't you?

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,500
she knows what your weakness is.
it's me.

77
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,900
what else did she say?

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,700
- dude?
- nothing.

79
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,700
nothing, okay?!

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
look, i'm not
an idiot, dean.

81
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,800
i'm not talking
about trusting her.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,700
<i>i'm talking about using her.</i>

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,300
i mean, we're at war, right?

84
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,000
and we don't know jack
about the enemy.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
we don't know where they are.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,300
we don't know what they're doing.

87
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,900
<i>hell, we don't even know
what they want.</i>

88
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,200
now, this ruby girl

89
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,700
<i>knows more than we will
ever find out on our own.</i>

90
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,400
now, yes, it's a risk.
i know that.

91
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,700
but we need to take it.

92
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,300
you're okay, right?
i mean, you're feeling okay?

93
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,100
yes, i'm fine! why are you
always asking me that?

94
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,800
it's not mine.

95
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,800
nope.

96
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,500
check the glove compartment.
it's dad's.

97
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
- dad's?
- yes.

98
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,900
i keep it charged in case
any of his old contacts call.

99
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,000
hello?

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,700
yes, this is edgar casey.

101
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,400
nono, no, no. don't -- don't call the police.
i'll handle this myself.

102
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,100
thanks.

103
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,100
you know, can you just -- can
you just lock it back up for me?

104
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,700
great.

105
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,800
uh, i, uh -- i don't have
my-my book in front of me.

106
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,100
do you -- do you have
the address so i can...

107
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,700
sure.
okay.

108
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,900
go ahead.

109
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,000
right.

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,900
thanks a lot.

111
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,700
dad ever tell you he kept a container
at a storage place?

112
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,500
- what?
- outside of buffalo.

113
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,900
no way.

114
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,700
yeah.

115
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,300
and someone
just broke into it.

116
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,400
bad day at black rock

117
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,800
so, you've got no hard evidence
on this winchester guy?

118
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,200
you're just working off
gordon's instincts.

119
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,700
you ever hunt with gordon?

120
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,700
no. i heard he's good.

121
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,200
good?

122
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,600
he's the best.

123
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,700
saved my ass more times
than i can count.

124
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,600
so, if he says
sam winchester's dangerous,

125
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,100
i believe him.

126
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,800
he's gonna be
covering his tracks.

127
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,100
won't be easy to find.

128
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,400
last i got puts him in nebraska
three weeks back.

129
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,700
<i>not exactly a fresh lead.</i>

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,600
<i>he ain't invisible, creedie.</i>

131
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,400
some hunter out there
knows something.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,100
so we start calling
our contacts.

133
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,700
all we need is one break.

134
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,100
don't play with my jesus.

135
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
man.

136
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,600
what?

137
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,600
just dad.
you know, him and his secrets.

138
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,400
we spent all this time
with this guy,

139
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,800
and it's like we barely even
know the man.

140
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,000
<i>well, we're about
to learn something.</i>

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,400
no demons allowed.

142
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
blood.

143
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
check this out.

144
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,400
whoever broke in here
got attacked.

145
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
dear, old dad.

146
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,800
i got two sets
of boot tracks.

147
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,900
it looks like
it was a two-man job.

148
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,100
and our friend
with the buckshot in him --

149
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,800
it looks like
he kept walking.

150
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
so, what's the deal?

151
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,100
dad would do work here
or something?

152
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,900
living the high life,
as usual.

153
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,600
1995.

154
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
no way!

155
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,200
that's my division championship
soccer trophy.

156
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,300
i can't believe
he kept this.

157
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,500
it was the probably the closest
you ever came to being a boy.

158
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,200
oh, wow!

159
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,900
it's my first sawed-off.
i made it myself.

160
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,000
sixth grade.

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,700
holy crap.

162
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,100
look at this.
he had land mines...

163
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,800
which they didn't take.

164
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,000
or the guns.

165
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,400
guess they knew
what they were after, huh?

166
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
hey, dean,
check this out.

167
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
see these symbols?

168
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,100
he used binding magic.

169
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,700
these are curse boxes.

170
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,000
curse boxes?

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,700
<i>they're supposed to keep
the evil mojo in, right?</i>

172
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700
kind of like
the pandora deal.

173
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,700
yeah, they're built to contain
the power of the cursed object.

174
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,600
dad's journal did mention
a whole bunch of stuff,

175
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,100
you know, dangerous,
hexed items, fetishes.

176
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,500
he never did say
where they ended up.

177
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,200
yeah.

178
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,400
this must be
his toxic-waste dump.

179
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,000
one box is missing.

180
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,900
great.

181
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,300
well, maybe
they didn't open it.

182
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,500
come on, man.
let's open it.

183
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,000
shut up
about the damn box!

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,500
do you see
what's happening here?

185
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,200
i'm literally bleeding
to death.

186
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,200
- i'm gonna open it.
- grossman...

187
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,300
look, what if this
is really worth something?

188
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,800
<i>what, we should
just hand it over to her?</i>

189
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,700
we took all the risk.

190
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
hell, wayne,

191
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,200
you got shot,

192
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,600
and all for a lousy
few hundred bucks.

193
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,600
now, we could make more selling
whatever it is ourselves.

194
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,700
huh?

195
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,400
are you kidding me?

196
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,700
are you kidding me?!

197
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,200
it's a rabbit's foot.

198
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,300
it's a rabbit's foot,
grossman!

199
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
i'm gonna die
for a damn rabbit's foot.

200
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,700
oh.

201
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
hey, foster.

202
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,600
hey, listen, guys,
not to be a drag or nothing,

203
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,800
but it's 6:00 in the morning.

204
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,700
- right.
- can't you guys keep it down?

205
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,300
no, we just got a situation here is all.
sorry.

206
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,000
what the hell
happened to you?

207
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,600
a shotgun happened to me.

208
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
- hey, grossman,
- yeah?

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,800
under my sink,
there's a medical kit.

210
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,500
and get some water boiling.

211
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,000
i used to be an army medic,
you know, in nam.

212
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,700
so, i guess
this is your lucky day.

213
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,100
connecticut.

214
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,900
last three digits 8-8-0.

215
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,900
yep. that's it.

216
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,600
should have blacked out
their plates

217
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,000
before they parked in front of
the security camera.

218
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,700
four kings.

219
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
you see that?

220
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,300
yeah, yeah, yeah.

221
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
deal it up again.

222
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
royal flush.

223
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,500
grossman, that's the second
royal flush in eight hands.

224
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,300
i can't lose.

225
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,100
<i>i mean, really,
i-i can't lose.</i>

226
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,000
i think this thing
really works.

227
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,800
you know what i'm saying?

228
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,300
i'll tell you one thing --
there's no way in hell

229
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,600
we are handing it over
to that stuck-up bitch.

230
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,900
- freeze! - freeze!

231
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,700
nobody move!

232
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,100
- don't move.
- don't move!

233
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,400
- what is it?
- stop!

234
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
all right.
give us the box.

235
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,400
<i>please tell me
that you didn't --</i>

236
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
oh, they did.

237
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
you opened it?!

238
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
are you guys cops?

239
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,700
- huh?
- are you guys cops?!

240
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,000
what was in the box?

241
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,400
<i>oh, was that it, huh?
it was, wasn't it?</i>

242
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
what is that thing?

243
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,000
sorry.

244
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,800
dean...

245
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,400
i got it.

246
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
no, you don't.

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,800
damn!

248
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,300
whoa!

249
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,900
sam!

250
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,900
that's a lucky break.

251
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,100
is that a rabbit's foot?

252
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,000
i think it is.

253
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,400
huh.

254
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,100
i'm not finding anything on it
in dad's journal.

255
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,500
- dean, come on.
- what?

256
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,600
<i>hey, that was my gun
he was aiming at your head.</i>

257
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
and my gun don't jam,
so that was a lucky break.

258
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
<i>not to mention them taking themselves out --
also a lucky break.</i>

259
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,100
here. scratch one.

260
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
come on, sam.

261
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,400
scratch and win.

262
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
look, dean, it's got to be
cursed somehow.

263
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,900
otherwise, dad wouldn't have
locked it up.

264
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,500
$1,200.

265
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,600
you just won $1,200.

266
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,200
whoo!

267
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,800
i don't know, man.
it doesn't seem that cursed to me.

268
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,300
grossman?

269
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,800
grossman, get up.

270
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,600
hey...

271
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,300
grossman, get up.

272
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,200
hey.

273
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
hey...

274
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,300
grossman?

275
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,200
oh.

276
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,000
ahhh!

277
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,600
oh, man.

278
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,300
now, look, bobby,
we didn't know.

279
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,300
you touched it?
damn it, sam.

280
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,000
well, dad never told us
about this thing.

281
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,600
i mean, you knew about
a storage place in black rock?

282
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,100
his lockup?
yeah, i knew.

283
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,200
hell, i built
those curse boxes for him.

284
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,700
listen, you have got
a serious problem.

285
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,300
that rabbit's foot
ain't no dime-store notion.

286
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,200
it's real hoodoo --
old-world stuff.

287
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,700
made by a baton rouge conjure
woman about 100 years ago.

288
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,300
it's a hell
of a luck charm.

289
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,200
<i>it's not a luck charm.
it's a curse.</i>

290
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,100
she made it
to kill people, sam.

291
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,100
see,

292
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,500
you touch it,
you own it.

293
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,400
you own it, sure, you get a run
of good luck to beat the devil.

294
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,300
but...

295
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,800
you lose it,
that luck turns.

296
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,800
it turns so bad
that you're dead inside a week.

297
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,200
so, i won't lose it, bobby.

298
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,700
everybody loses it!

299
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,500
well, then, how do we break the curse?

300
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,000
i don't know if you can.

301
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,200
let me look through my library
and make some calls.

302
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,200
just sit tight.

303
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,100
dude,

304
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
we're up 15 grand.

305
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,500
don't worry.

306
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,100
bobby will find a way
to break it.

307
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,900
till then, i say we hit vegas,
pull a little "rain man."

308
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,900
you can be rain man.

309
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,300
we just lay low
until bobby calls back, okay?

310
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,100
hi. uh,
table for two, please.

311
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,500
congratulations!

312
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,700
say that again?

313
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,100
you are the one millionth guest
of the biggerson's restaurant family.

314
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,200
right. if you hear anything,
give me a call.

315
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,700
well, that clears my book.

316
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,200
the word's out.

317
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,800
now we wait.

318
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,300
now we eat.

319
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
good idea.

320
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,900
what do you like?
i got canned everything.

321
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,600
no, no, man.
not eating in the r.v.

322
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,200
look, i know a good place.

323
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,600
wide menu, good service,
homey atmosphere...

324
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
garlic knots.

325
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
the menu's
on their website.

326
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,700
bobby's right.

327
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,700
<i>this lore goes way back.</i>

328
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,100
pure hoodoo.

329
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
you can't just cut one
off any rabbit.

330
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,800
it has to be in a cemetery

331
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,600
under a full moon
on a friday the 13th.

332
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,900
i think from now on,

333
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,300
we only go to places
with biggerson's.

334
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,800
can i freshen you up?

335
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,400
yeah. yeah, sure.

336
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,800
thanks.

337
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,900
- oh.
- oh.

338
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,200
oh, i -- no, don't worry.
that's okay. that's -- i got it.

339
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,600
it's no trouble, really.

340
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,800
okay.

341
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
sorry about that.

342
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
it's all right.

343
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,800
dude,

344
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,900
<i>if you were
ever gonna get lucky...</i>

345
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,700
chill out.

346
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,100
oh! oh, jeez!

347
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
sorry.

348
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,500
how was that good?

349
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,000
son of a bitch.

350
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,700
come on.

351
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,900
whoa!

352
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,200
wow.

353
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,300
you suck.

354
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,900
so, what,
now your luck turns bad?

355
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,300
i guess.

356
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,600
<i>i wonder how bad.</i>

357
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,300
looks good.

358
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,600
i like that when they drop
the whole onion in the fryer.

359
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,400
nearest location...

360
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,700
you seeing that?

361
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,400
yes, i am.

362
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,300
???

363
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,300
oh, man.

364
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,200
what do you want?

365
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,500
heard about your friend.

366
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
it's bad luck.

367
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,700
piss off.

368
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,000
we know someone hired you
to steal the rabbit's foot --

369
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,800
a woman.

370
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,900
yeah?

371
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,900
how do you know that?

372
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,100
<i>because she just stole it
back from us.</i>

373
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,500
listen, man, this is --

374
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
sam, you okay?

375
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,300
yeah. i'm good.

376
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,700
i want you
to tell us her name.

377
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,900
screw you.

378
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,800
it wasn't a freak accident
that killed your partner.

379
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,300
what?

380
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,800
it was the rabbit's foot.

381
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,300
you're crazy, man.

382
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
you know i'm not.

383
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,600
you saw what happened,
what it did --

384
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,400
all the flukes,
all the luck.

385
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,100
when you lose the foot,
that luck goes sour.

386
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
<i>that's what killed
your friend.</i>

387
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,600
and my brother here is next,

388
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,300
and who knows how many more
innocent people after that.

389
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,500
now, if you don't help us
stop this thing,

390
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,400
then that puts those deaths
on your head.

391
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,900
now, i can read people...

392
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,800
and i get it.

393
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,100
you're a thief and a scumbag.

394
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,000
that's fine.

395
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,800
but you're not a killer...

396
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,500
are you?

397
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,200
no one
saw which way they went,

398
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,600
and their meal was free,
so there's no credit-card trail.

399
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,000
don't worry.
we'll find them.

400
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,500
what makes you so sure?

401
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,500
'cause there's a higher power
at work here.

402
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,300
i know it now.

403
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,100
hello.

404
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,500
dean, great news.

405
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,900
wasn't easy, but i found a heavyweight
cleansing ritual that should do the trick.

406
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,900
bobby, that's, uh, great,
except sam, uh...

407
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,200
...sam lost the foot.

408
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,300
he what?

409
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,200
bobby, listen, listen.

410
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,400
this hot chick
stole it from him.

411
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,600
i'm serious.

412
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,900
in her mid-20s,
and she was sharp, you know?

413
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,600
good enough of a con
to play us.

414
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
and she only gave
the guys she hired a name --

415
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,400
probably an alias
or something.

416
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,900
luigi or something.

417
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,300
lugosi.

418
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
lugosi?

419
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
lugosi.

420
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,500
oh, crap.
it's probably bela.

421
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,000
bela lugosi?
that's cute.

422
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,800
<i>bela talbot's
her real name.</i>

423
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,900
crossed paths with her
once or twice.

424
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,700
she knew about the rabbit's foot.
is she a hunter?

425
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,500
pretty friggin' far
from a hunter,

426
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,400
but she knows her way
around the territory.

427
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,700
she's been out of the country.

428
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,000
last i heard, she was
in the middle east someplace.

429
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,500
i guess she's back.

430
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,300
which means
seriously bad luck for you.

431
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,400
great.

432
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,500
<i>but if it is bela,</i>

433
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,600
at least i might know some folks
who know where to find her.

434
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,200
thanks, bobby, again.

435
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,700
just look out
for your brother, you idjit.

436
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,800
what?

437
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,600
i lost my shoe.

438
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,300
all right, bobby, thanks.
hey, we owe you...another one.

439
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,900
all right, bobby's got it
on pretty good authority

440
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,500
that this bela chick
lives in queens.

441
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,900
so it will take me
about two hours to get there.

442
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,300
so, what are we doing then?

443
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,200
you, my brother,
are staying here,

444
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
'cause i don't want
your bad luck getting us killed.

445
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,300
what am i even
supposed to do, dean?

446
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,900
nothing. nothing.
come here.

447
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,100
<i>i don't want you
doing anything.</i>

448
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,500
i want you to sit right here

449
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,500
and don't move, okay?

450
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,800
<i>don't turn on the light.
don't turn off the light.</i>

451
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,600
don't even
scratch your nose.

452
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,400
because you shook on 1.5.

453
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
well, maybe i should
just take it somewhere else.

454
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,400
don't threaten me, luke.

455
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,400
despite your reputation,
you don't scare me.

456
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,200
well, i'm glad
you see it that way.

457
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,300
i'll see you at the airstrip
in an hour.

458
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,100
???

459
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,300
oh, come on. i--

460
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,400
i didn't --

461
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,500
ah!

462
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,600
you're gonna give it back.

463
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,100
sweetie,

464
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
no, i'm not.

465
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
yeah? we'll see.

466
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,900
bela, right?

467
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,200
that's right...

468
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,800
dean.

469
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,400
you know the thing's cursed,
don't you?

470
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,600
you'd be surprised what some people
would pay for something like that.

471
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,300
really?

472
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,900
there's a lucrative market
out there.

473
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,000
a lot of money to be made.

474
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,300
you hunters, with all those amulets
and talismans you use

475
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,900
to stop those big,
bad monsters --

476
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,100
any one of them could put your children's
children through college.

477
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,500
so, you know the truth

478
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,900
about what's really going on
out there,

479
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,900
and this is what you decide
to do with it?

480
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,300
you become a thief.

481
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,300
i procure unique items
for a select clientele.

482
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,300
yeah.

483
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
a thief.

484
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,700
no.

485
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,400
<i>a great thief.</i>

486
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,200
oh, he's awake.

487
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,100
back with us, eh?

488
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,900
we didn't even
have to touch you.

489
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,900
???
and knocked yourself out.

490
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,000
it was like watching jerry lewis
trying to stack chairs.

491
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,500
who are you?

492
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,200
what do you wan--

493
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,800
i used to think your friend
gordon sent me...

494
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,300
gordon?

495
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,200
oh, come on.

496
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,400
...because he asked me
to track you down

497
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,800
and put a bullet
in your brain.

498
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,100
great.
that sounds like him.

499
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,800
but

500
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,700
as it turns out...

501
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,900
i'm on a mission from god.

502
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,500
look, bela.

503
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,800
my brother, he...
touched the foot.

504
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,800
and when you took it from him,
his luck went from --

505
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,400
i know how it works.

506
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,000
so, then you know he's gonna die
unless we can destroy it.

507
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
oh.

508
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,600
you can have the foot...

509
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,100
for $1.5 million.

510
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,000
nice.

511
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,900
yeah.
i'll just call my banker.

512
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,300
how'd you even find
the damn thing,

513
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,400
stuck in the back
of some storage place,

514
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
middle of nowhere?

515
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,200
i just asked a few of the ghosts
of the people it had killed.

516
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,900
they were very tuned in
to its location.

517
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,600
so you're only
after yourself, huh?

518
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,900
it's all about number one.

519
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,500
being a hunter
is so much more noble?

520
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,100
a bunch of obsessed,
revenge-driven sociopaths

521
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
trying to save a world
that can't be saved.

522
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,800
well, aren't you
a glass half full.

523
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,000
we're all going to hell, dean.

524
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,300
might as well enjoy the ride.

525
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,900
i actually
agree with you there.

526
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,400
anyhoo, this has been charming,
but, uh, look at the time.

527
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,600
oh, and...

528
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,600
this.

529
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,100
you're not the only one
with sticky fingers.

530
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,500
<i>if it's any consolation, i think
you're a truly awful person.</i>

531
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,200
you were a part of that demon plan
to open the gate, weren't you?

532
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,500
we did everything we could
to stop it.

533
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,000
lie, lie, lie!

534
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,100
you were in on it.

535
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,200
you know what they're next move
is, too, don't you?

536
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,000
no, i don't, okay?
you're wrong about all of this.

537
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,800
where are they gonna
hit us next?

538
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,800
where?!

539
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,800
gordon
told me about you, sam,

540
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,600
about your powers.

541
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,400
you're some kind of
weirdo psychic freak.

542
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
no, not anymore.

543
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
i have no powers,
no visions -- nothing.

544
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,900
- it just --
- lie!

545
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,900
now no more lies.

546
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,100
there's an army of demons
out there,

547
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,400
pushing at a world
already on the brink.

548
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,000
we're on deck
for the end game here, right?

549
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,600
so maybe,

550
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,000
just maybe
you can understand

551
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,300
why we can't take chances.

552
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,400
whoa! okay, okay.

553
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,000
- now, hold on a minute.
- kubrick, get...

554
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,200
no! you saw what happened, creedie.

555
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,600
ask yourself --

556
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,500
why are we here?

557
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,100
because you saw a picture
on the web?

558
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,300
<i>because we chose this motel
instead of another?</i>

559
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,000
<i>luck like that
doesn't just happen.</i>

560
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,200
look, i can explain
all of that.

561
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,400
shut up.

562
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,300
it's god, creedie.

563
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,300
he led us here
for one reason --

564
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,100
to do his work.

565
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,700
this is destiny.

566
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,600
whoa.

567
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,800
no.

568
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
no destiny.

569
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,900
just a rabbit's foot.

570
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,100
put the gun down, son,

571
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,300
or you're gonna be
scraping brain off the wall.

572
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,700
oh, this thing?

573
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
yeah, that thing.

574
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,200
okay.

575
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,300
but, you see, there's something
about me that you don't know.

576
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,700
yeah? what would that be?

577
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,200
it's my lucky day.

578
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,200
oh, my god!
did you see that shot?!

579
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,900
i'm amazing.

580
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,900
i'm batman.

581
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
yeah.

582
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,800
you're batman.

583
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,700
all right.

584
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,200
bone ash,

585
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,800
cayenne pepper.

586
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,000
that should do it.

587
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
one second.

588
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:52,900
dean --

589
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,400
hey, back off, jinx.

590
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,100
i'm bringing home the bacon.

591
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
all right.

592
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,900
say goodbye to "wascawy wabbit."

593
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,400
i think you'll find
that belongs to me.

594
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,200
or, you know...

595
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,000
whatever.

596
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,900
put the foot down, honey.

597
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,700
no.

598
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,700
you're not
gonna shoot anybody.

599
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,400
see, i happen to be able
to read people.

600
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
okay, you're a thief. fine.
but you're not --

601
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,600
oh!

602
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,000
son of a --

603
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,900
back off, tiger.

604
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,800
back off.

605
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,200
you make one more move,
and i'll pull the trigger.

606
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,800
you've got the luck, dean.
you i can't hit.

607
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
but your brother --

608
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,800
him i can't miss.

609
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,800
the hell is wrong
with you?!

610
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,100
you don't just do around
shooting people like that!

611
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
relax.

612
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,100
it's a shoulder hit.
i can aim.

613
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,200
besides,

614
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
<i>who here
hasn't shot a few people?</i>

615
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,000
put the rabbit's foot
on the ground now.

616
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,900
all right!

617
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,000
all right.

618
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
take it easy.

619
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,500
think fast.

620
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,500
damn.

621
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,600
now,

622
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,100
what do you say we destroy
that ugly-ass piece of dead thing?

623
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,100
thanks very much.

624
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,300
i'm out $1.5 million

625
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,700
and on the bad side of a very powerful,
fairly psychotic buyer.

626
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,800
wow.

627
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,900
i really don't feel bad
about that.

628
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,800
sam?

629
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,700
no.

630
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,500
not even a little.

631
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,100
maybe next time,

632
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,400
<i>i'll hang you out to dry.</i>

633
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,500
oh, don't go away angry.
just go away.

634
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,500
have a nice night, boys.

635
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,800
you good?

636
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
i'll live.

637
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,800
i guess we're back
to normal now, huh?

638
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,600
no good luck.

639
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,900
no bad luck.

640
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,700
oh,

641
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,200
i forgot.
we're at $46,000.

642
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
i almost forgot about the...

643
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,500
scratch tickets.

644
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,400
son of a bitch!

645
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,400
you were right
about everything.

646
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,900
sam winchester
is more than a monster.

647
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,500
he's the adversary.

648
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,700
and what was it
that convinced you?

649
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
god led me to him...

650
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
and his will is clear.

651
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,300
okay.

652
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,900
that's great.

653
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,200
i'm glad
to have you on board.

654
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
but, uh, first things first.

655
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,600
we got to get me
the hell out of here.

656
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,200
'cause like i told you
before,

657
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,200
sam winchester must die.
