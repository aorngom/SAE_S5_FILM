1
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:03,557
Something turned him into a monster.

2
00:00:03,682 --> 00:00:06,210
- What are we dealing with, do you know?
- Croatoan, a demonic virus.

3
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:08,788
- More like demonic germ warfare.
- What if we all have it?

4
00:00:08,913 --> 00:00:10,443
What if we all go crazy?

5
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:14,305
Back in 1835,
Samuel Colt made a gun.

6
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,515
They say this gun can kill anything.

7
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,538
- I'm a vessel?
- You're the vessel.

8
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:19,754
You need my consent.

9
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,845
Michael needs my say-so
to ride around in my skin.

10
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,242
Unfortunately, yes.

11
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:24,572
The answer's no.

12
00:00:24,697 --> 00:00:26,317
- You know who I am.
- Lucifer.

13
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,944
You're the one, sam.
You're my vessel.

14
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:31,906
That'll never happen.
I know you don't trust me.

15
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:34,164
- So, what are you saying?
- I'm dangerous.

16
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,577
Maybe it's best we just go
our separate ways.

17
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:44,015
Good evening, brother.
Is your soul rapture-ready?

18
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:46,066
Thank you, sir.
God bless.

19
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:49,139
Good evening, folks.
Is your soul rapture-ready?

20
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:52,123
Because what I'd like to do is just show
you exactly what god's love is for you.

21
00:00:52,248 --> 00:00:53,547
Okay, god bless.

22
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,152
Excuse me,

23
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:58,504
but have you taken time out
to think about god's plan for you?

24
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:02,077
Too friggin' much, pal.

25
00:01:06,946 --> 00:01:09,087
We're talking about the colt, right?

26
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:12,410
- I mean, as in The Colt?
- We are.

27
00:01:12,535 --> 00:01:13,863
That doesn't make any sense.

28
00:01:13,988 --> 00:01:17,034
Why would the demons keep
a gun around that kills demons?

29
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,419
What? Did...

30
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,860
I didn't...

31
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:23,152
I didn't get that.

32
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:24,790
It's kind of funny,

33
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:27,253
talking to a messenger of god
on a cellphone.

34
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:29,771
It's like watching
a hells angel ride a mo-ped.

35
00:01:29,896 --> 00:01:31,280
This isn't funny, Dean.

36
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:33,109
The voice says
i'm almost out of minutes.

37
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:34,084
All right.

38
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,686
I'm telling you, Cass,

39
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:37,626
the mooks have
melted down the gun by now.

40
00:01:37,986 --> 00:01:39,223
I hear differently.

41
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,704
And if it's true

42
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,512
and if you are still set
on the insane task

43
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,895
of killing the devil,
this is how we do it.

44
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:47,526
Where do we start?

45
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,275
Where are you now?

46
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,415
Kansas city.

47
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,019
Century hotel, room 113.

48
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:56,676
I'll be there immediately.

49
00:01:58,023 --> 00:02:00,375
I just drove like 16 hours straight.

50
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,585
I'm human.

51
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,582
- And there's stuff I got to do.
- What stuff?

52
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,969
Eat, for example.

53
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:08,771
In this case, sleep. I just need
like four hours once in a while.

54
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:12,098
So, you can pop in tomorrow morning.

55
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:15,063
I'll just...

56
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:21,144
... wait here, then.

57
00:02:33,308 --> 00:02:35,647
Damn it, Cass, I need to sleep!

58
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,870
Dean, it's me.

59
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:43,620
It's quarter past 4:00.

60
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:45,071
This is important.

61
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:49,610
So, you're his vessel?

62
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:53,489
Lucifer's wearing you to the prom?

63
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,698
That's what he said.

64
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:58,061
Just when you thought you were out,
they pull you back in.

65
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,846
So, that's it?
That's your response?

66
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:03,073
- What are you looking for?
- I don't know.

67
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:04,850
A little panic, maybe?

68
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:07,978
I guess i'm a little numb to the earth
- shattering revelations at this point.

69
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,679
What are we gonna do about it?

70
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:12,042
What do you want to do about it?

71
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:14,587
I want back in, for starters.

72
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:15,953
I mean it.

73
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,447
I am sick of being a puppet
to these sons of bitches.

74
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:20,981
I'm gonna hunt him down.

75
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:22,785
So, we're back to revenge,
then, are we?

76
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,613
'cause that worked out
so well last time.

77
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,757
Not revenge.

78
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:27,998
Redemption.

79
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:31,262
You're just gonna walk back in and
we're gonna be the dynamic duo again?

80
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:33,033
Look, Dean, I can do this.
I can.

81
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,130
I'm gonna prove it to you.

82
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:40,467
Look, Sam...

83
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,379
It doesn't matter...

84
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:44,494
Whatever we do.

85
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:48,907
It turns out that you and me,
we're the...

86
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:51,511
The fire and the oil
of the armageddon.

87
00:03:51,737 --> 00:03:54,908
On that basis alone, we should just
pick a hemisphere...

88
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,570
Stay away from each other for good.

89
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:00,687
It does not have to be like this.
We can fight it.

90
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:03,511
You're right. We can.
But not together.

91
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,392
We're not stronger
when we're together, Sam.

92
00:04:09,654 --> 00:04:10,974
I think we're weaker.

93
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:14,662
Because whatever we have
between us...

94
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:17,392
Love, family, whatever it is...

95
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:20,647
They arealways
gonna use it against us.

96
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:22,891
And you know that.

97
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:30,460
We're better off apart.

98
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:34,240
We got a better chance
of dodging Lucifer and Michael

99
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:35,756
and this whole damn thing...

100
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,542
If we just go our own ways.

101
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:41,739
Dean, don't do this.

102
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,006
Bye, Sam.

103
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,188
= 504 =

104
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:41,131
= Supernatural Team =

105
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,661
Little girl?

106
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,773
Little girl?

107
00:06:48,544 --> 00:06:49,857
Are you hurt?

108
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,831
You know the not-talking thing
is kind of creepy, right?

109
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:14,120
Oh, crap.

110
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,538
"NO ENTRY
by order of acting regional command"

111
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:38,656
August 1st, 2014.

112
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,023
That's never a good sign.

113
00:09:04,956 --> 00:09:08,005
Croatoan pandemic reaches Australia.

114
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,176
I thought I smelled your stink
on this "back to the future" crap.

115
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,860
"President Palin
defends bombing of houston."

116
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:17,014
Certainly a buyer's market
in real estate.

117
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,044
Let's see what's
happening in sports.

118
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:21,407
That's right... No more sports.

119
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:23,719
Congress revoked the right
to group assembly.

120
00:09:24,216 --> 00:09:26,963
What's left of congress, that is.
Hardly a quorum, if you ask me.

121
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:28,193
How did you find me?

122
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,037
Afraid we had to tap some
unorthodox resources of late...

123
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:32,763
Human informants.

124
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:36,424
We've been making inspirational visits
to the fringier christian groups.

125
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:38,715
They've been given your image,
told to keep an eye out.

126
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,563
The bible freak outside the motel...

127
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:42,113
He, what, dropped a dime on me?

128
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:44,926
- Onward, christian soldiers.
- Okay, well, good, great.

129
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,355
You have had your jollies.

130
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,224
Now send me back,
you son of a bitch.

131
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:50,086
You'll get back...
All in good time.

132
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,459
We want you to marinate a bit.

133
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,528
- Marinate?
- Three days, Dean.

134
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,903
Three days to see where
this course of action takes you.

135
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:00,849
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means...

136
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,410
that your choices have consequences.

137
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,844
This is what happens to the world
if you continue to say "no" to Michael.

138
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:13,118
Have a little look-see.

139
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:26,130
Bobby?

140
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:30,618
Bobby, I'm coming in!

141
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,888
Where is everybody, Bobby?

142
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:22,347
"Camp chitaqua."

143
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:04,328
No, baby, what did they do to you?

144
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:18,899


145
00:12:30,426 --> 00:12:31,384
What the hell?

146
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:33,655
I should be asking that question,
don't you think?

147
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,338
In fact, why don't you
give me one good reason

148
00:12:36,813 --> 00:12:38,866
why I shouldn't gank you
right here and now?

149
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:42,094
Because you'd only be
hurting yourself.

150
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:43,544
Very funny.

151
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:48,252
Look, man...

152
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:52,711
I'm no shapeshifter or demon
or anything, okay?

153
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:54,940
I know. I did the drill
while you were out.

154
00:12:55,537 --> 00:12:58,140
Silver, salt, holy water...
Nothing.

155
00:12:59,794 --> 00:13:01,201
But you know what was funny...

156
00:13:02,204 --> 00:13:06,049
Was that you had every hidden lock pick,
box cutter and switchblade that i carry.

157
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,578
Now, you want to explain that?

158
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:12,416
And the... resemblance,
while you're at it?

159
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:15,669
Zachariah.

160
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:20,884
Come again?

161
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,427
I'm you from the tail end of 2009.

162
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:27,931
Zach plucked me from my bed and
threw me five years into the future.

163
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:29,853
Where is he?
I want to talk to him.

164
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:31,500
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

165
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,864
No, I don't know.

166
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:35,360
I just want to get back
to my own friggin' year, okay?

167
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,645
If you're me...

168
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:47,387
Then tell me something
only I would know.

169
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:56,736
Rhonda hurley.

170
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:00,980
We were... 19.

171
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,885
She made us try on her panties.

172
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:07,094
They were pink.

173
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:08,463
And satiny.

174
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:10,226
And you know what?

175
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:13,446
We kind of liked it.

176
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:16,850
Touché.

177
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:26,389
So, what... Zach zapped you
up here to see how bad it gets?

178
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:27,545
I guess.

179
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:30,799
Croatoan virus, right?

180
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,416
That's their endgame?

181
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,545
It's efficient, it's incurable,

182
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:36,559
and it's scary as hell.

183
00:14:36,684 --> 00:14:38,216
Turns people into monsters.

184
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,331
Started hitting the major cities
about two years ago.

185
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:44,043
World really went
in the crapper after that.

186
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:46,343
What about Sam?

187
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:56,746
Heavyweight showdown in Detroit.

188
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:00,800
From what I understand,
sam didn't make it.

189
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,571
- You weren't with him?
- No.

190
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:11,936
No, me and Sam,
We hadn't talked in...

191
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,987
Hell, five years.

192
00:15:19,264 --> 00:15:20,796
We never tried to find him?

193
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,801
I got other people to worry about.

194
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:27,459
Where you going?
I got to run an errand.

195
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,845
You're just gonna leave me here?

196
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,282
I got a camp full of twitchy
trauma survivors out there

197
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,526
with an apocalypse hanging
over their head.

198
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,292
The last thing they need to see
is a version of "the parent trap."

199
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,861
So, yeah, you stay locked down.

200
00:15:41,602 --> 00:15:44,124
All right, fine.
But you don't have to cuff me, man.

201
00:15:46,104 --> 00:15:48,488
- Oh, come on.
- You don't trust yourself?

202
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:52,548
Absolutely not.

203
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,403
Dick.

204
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:24,470
Hey, Dean.

205
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:26,056
You got a second?

206
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:27,955
No. Yes.

207
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:30,707
I guess.
Hi, chuck.

208
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:33,325
Hi. So, listen, we're pretty
good on canned goods for now,

209
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:37,078
but we're down to next to nothing
on perishables and hygiene supplies.

210
00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:39,375
People are not gonna be
happy about this.

211
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:42,250
So, what do you think we should do?

212
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:45,386
I don't know.

213
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:48,559
Maybe... share?

214
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:50,782
Like at a kibbutz.

215
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,788
Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to be
out on a mission right now?

216
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,555
Absolutely.
And I will be.

217
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:00,554
Easy, lady!

218
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,354
Risa.

219
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,998
You spent the night in Jane's
cabin last night, didn't you?

220
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:05,323
Uh, what?

221
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:06,691
I- I don't... did i?

222
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,408
I thought we had a "connection."

223
00:17:10,002 --> 00:17:12,072
- I'm sure that we do.
- Yeah?

224
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,351
- Hi, risa.
- Screw you.

225
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,551
I'm getting busted for stuff
I haven't even done yet.

226
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:19,408
What?

227
00:17:20,146 --> 00:17:21,448
Never mind.

228
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:25,280
Hey, Chuck, is... Cass still here?

229
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:29,547
I don't think Cass
is going anywhere.

230
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:42,727
So, in this way,

231
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:46,898
we're each a fragment
of total perception...

232
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:54,365
Just one compartment
in that dragonfly eye of group mind.

233
00:17:55,665 --> 00:18:00,682
Now, the key to this total,
shared perception...

234
00:18:00,807 --> 00:18:01,726
It's...

235
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:04,916
It's surprisingly physical.

236
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:08,465
Excuse me, ladies.

237
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,245
I think I need to confer
with our fearless leader for a minute.

238
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,174
Why not go get washed up
for the orgy?

239
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,180
You're all so beautiful.

240
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:29,541
What are you, a hippie?

241
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:32,524
I thought you'd gotten
over trying to label me.

242
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:36,008
Cass, we got to talk.

243
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:37,827
- Strange.
- What?

244
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:41,799
You... are not you...
Not "now" you, anyway.

245
00:18:41,924 --> 00:18:44,038
No! Yeah.
Yes, exactly.

246
00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:46,541
- What year are you from?
- 2009.

247
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:49,353
Who did this to you?

248
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:51,354
- Is it zachariah?
- Yes.

249
00:18:52,825 --> 00:18:53,785
Interesting.

250
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:55,295
It's friggin' fascinating.

251
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,552
Now why don't you
strap on your angel wings

252
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,623
and fly me back
to my page on the calendar?

253
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,674
I wish I could just,
strap on my wings,

254
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,572
but I'm sorry... No dice.

255
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:13,092
What, are you stoned?

256
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:15,316
Generally, yeah.

257
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:19,574
What happened to you?

258
00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:22,160
Life.

259
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:52,391
Watch out!

260
00:20:03,006 --> 00:20:03,887
Damn it.

261
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:08,039
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Me and him...

262
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:10,954
It's a pretty messed-up
situation we got going.

263
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,685
But believe me,

264
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:15,463
when you need to know something,
you will know it.

265
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:19,270
Until then, we all have work to do.

266
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,515
What the hell was that?

267
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,171
What the hell was that?

268
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:29,615
You just shot a guy in cold blood.

269
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:32,324
We were in an open
quarantine zone...

270
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:34,858
Got ambushed by some crotes
on the way out.

271
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,650
Crotes... croatoans.

272
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:38,510
One of them infected Yager.

273
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,223
How do you know?

274
00:20:40,602 --> 00:20:42,677
'cause after
a few years of this, I know.

275
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:45,156
I started seeing symptoms
about a half an hour ago.

276
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,161
Wasn't gonna be long
before he flipped.

277
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,028
I didn't see the point in troubling
a good man with bad news.

278
00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:52,373
"Troubling a good man"?

279
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:54,489
You just blew him away
in front of your own people.

280
00:20:54,614 --> 00:20:56,605
Don't you think that
freaked them out a little bit?

281
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,519
It's 2014.

282
00:20:57,644 --> 00:21:00,505
Plugging some crote,
it's called commonplace.

283
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,806
Trading words
with my friggin' clone...

284
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:04,842
that might have
freaked them out a little.

285
00:21:05,235 --> 00:21:07,537
- All right, look...
- No, you look.

286
00:21:07,662 --> 00:21:09,686
This isn't your time.
It's mine.

287
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,381
You don't make the decisions.
I do.

288
00:21:11,506 --> 00:21:14,439
So, when I say stay in, you stay in.

289
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:22,614
All right. I'm sorry.

290
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:26,010
Look, I'm not trying
to mess you or... me...

291
00:21:27,081 --> 00:21:28,923
- Us up here.
- I know.

292
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,674
It's just been
a really wacky weekend.

293
00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:37,087
Tell me about it.

294
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:47,664
What was the mission, anyway?

295
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,210
The Colt?

296
00:22:01,637 --> 00:22:02,722
The Colt.

297
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,220
Where was it?

298
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:08,038
Everywhere.

299
00:22:08,512 --> 00:22:10,286
They've been moving it around.

300
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:13,812
Took me five years, but...

301
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:16,524
I finally got it.

302
00:22:17,406 --> 00:22:18,711
And tonight...

303
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:22,614
I'm gonna kill the devil.

304
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,139


305
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,242
So, that's it?
That's The Colt?

306
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:40,331
If anything can kill Lucifer,
this is it.

307
00:22:41,334 --> 00:22:42,199
Great.

308
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:44,636
Have we got anything
that can find Lucifer?

309
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:49,700
- Are you okay?
- We were in Jane's cabin last night.

310
00:22:50,154 --> 00:22:55,175
And, apparently,
we and Risa have a connection.

311
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:00,670
You want to shut up?

312
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:03,293
We don't have to find Lucifer.
We know where he is.

313
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,020
The demon
that we caught last week...

314
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:09,980
He was one of the big guy's entourage.
He knew.

315
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:11,974
So, a demon tells you
where Satan's gonna be,

316
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,516
And you just believe it?

317
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,893
Oh, trust me...
he wasn't lying.

318
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,403
And you know this how?

319
00:23:17,528 --> 00:23:19,182
Our fearless leader, i'm afraid,

320
00:23:19,307 --> 00:23:22,430
is all too well schooled
in the art of getting to the truth.

321
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:25,620
Torture?

322
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:31,342
Oh, so, we're...
we're torturing again.

323
00:23:32,806 --> 00:23:35,302
No, that's... that's good.
Classy.

324
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:41,453
What?
I like "past you."

325
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:44,913
Lucifer is here.

326
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:47,599
Now, I know the block
and I know the building.

327
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:50,919
Good... it's right in the middle
of a hot zone.

328
00:23:51,044 --> 00:23:53,237
Crawling with crotes.
You saying my plan is reckless?

329
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:56,302
Are you saying
we walk in straight up the driveway,

330
00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:58,895
past all the demons and the crotes,
and we shoot the devil?

331
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:02,102
Okay, if you don't like "reckless",

332
00:24:02,227 --> 00:24:04,567
- I could use "insouciant," maybe.
- Are you coming?

333
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:07,596
Of course.

334
00:24:07,954 --> 00:24:10,042
But why is he?
He's you five years ago.

335
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:12,073
If something happens to him,
you're gone, right?

336
00:24:12,198 --> 00:24:13,115
He's coming.

337
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,407
Okay.

338
00:24:16,446 --> 00:24:17,732
I'll get the grunts moving.

339
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:19,640
We're loaded and on the road
by midnight.

340
00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:21,042
All righty.

341
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,761
- Why are you taking me?
- Relax. You'll be fine.

342
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,948
Zach's looking after you, right?

343
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,619
No, that's not what I mean.

344
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,725
I want to know what's going on.

345
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,321
You're coming
because I want you to see something.

346
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,117
I want you to see our brother.

347
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,442
Sam?

348
00:24:58,178 --> 00:24:59,372
I thought he was dead.

349
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,571
Sam didn't die in detroit.

350
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:07,213
He said "yes."

351
00:25:08,144 --> 00:25:09,132
"Yes"?

352
00:25:14,152 --> 00:25:15,278
Wait.

353
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,517
- You mean...
- That's right.

354
00:25:19,956 --> 00:25:21,529
The big "yes".

355
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,561
To the devil.

356
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:27,187
Lucifer's wearing him to the prom.

357
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:34,795
- Why would he do that?
- Wish I knew.

358
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,663
But now we don't have a choice.

359
00:25:39,476 --> 00:25:41,664
It's in him
and it's not getting out.

360
00:25:43,446 --> 00:25:45,724
And we've got to kill him, Dean.

361
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,398
And you need to see it...

362
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:53,800
The whole damn thing,
how bad it gets...

363
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,927
- So you can do it different.
- What do you mean?

364
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:59,097
Zach said he was gonna
bring you back, right? To'09?

365
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:01,918
When you get back home...

366
00:26:03,382 --> 00:26:05,202
You say "yes."

367
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:08,537
You hear me?
Say "yes" to Michael.

368
00:26:08,662 --> 00:26:10,178
That's crazy.

369
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:12,444
If I let him in,
then Michael fights the devil.

370
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:14,353
The battle's gonna torch
half the planet.

371
00:26:14,478 --> 00:26:16,180
Look around you, man.

372
00:26:16,305 --> 00:26:18,353
Half the planet's better
than no planet,

373
00:26:18,478 --> 00:26:19,917
which is what we have now.

374
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:23,121
If I could do it over again,
i'd say "yes" in a heartbeat.

375
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,291
- So why don't you?
- I've tried!

376
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,823
I've shouted "yes"
till I was blue in the face!

377
00:26:27,948 --> 00:26:29,261
The angels aren't listening!

378
00:26:29,386 --> 00:26:31,118
They just... left... gave up!

379
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,041
It's too late for me, but for you...

380
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:34,675
No. There's got to be another way.

381
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,396
That's what I thought.

382
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,403
I was cocky.

383
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,884
Never actually thought i'd lose.

384
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:45,978
But I was wrong.

385
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:50,735
Dean...
I was wrong.

386
00:26:53,189 --> 00:26:55,182
I'm begging you.

387
00:26:56,132 --> 00:26:57,865
Say "yes."

388
00:27:07,362 --> 00:27:09,111
But you won't.

389
00:27:11,118 --> 00:27:12,542
'cause I didn't.

390
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:18,386
Because that's just not us, is it?

391
00:27:27,697 --> 00:27:29,795
So, you're really from'09?

392
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,341
Yeah, afraid so.

393
00:27:31,466 --> 00:27:32,683
Some free advice?

394
00:27:32,808 --> 00:27:35,860
You ever get back there,
you hoard toilet paper.

395
00:27:35,985 --> 00:27:37,798
You understand me?
Hoard it.

396
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,453
Hoard it like it's made of gold.

397
00:27:39,578 --> 00:27:40,533
'cause it is.

398
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:41,924
Thank you, chuck.

399
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:44,381
You'll thank me, all right.
Mark my words.

400
00:27:45,432 --> 00:27:46,652
I'll see you around.

401
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,677
Let me see those.

402
00:28:09,152 --> 00:28:10,563
You want some?

403
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,183
Amphetamines?

404
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,801
It's the perfect antidote
to that absinthe.

405
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:22,102
Don't get me wrong, Cass.

406
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,277
I'm happy that the stick
is out of your ass, but...

407
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,205
What's going on with the drugs

408
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,755
And the orgies
and the love-guru crap?

409
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,518
What's so funny?

410
00:28:35,387 --> 00:28:37,242
Dean, i'm not an angel anymore.

411
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:38,174
What?

412
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,767
Yeah, I went mortal.

413
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:41,408
What do you mean? How?

414
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,892
I think it had something to do
with the other angels leaving,

415
00:28:44,286 --> 00:28:46,430
but when they bailed,
my mojo just kind of...

416
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,961
... drained away.

417
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,636
And now, you know,
i'm practically human.

418
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:54,857
I mean, Dean, i'm all but useless.

419
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,944
Last year, broke my foot...
laid up for two months.

420
00:28:59,852 --> 00:29:01,181
So, you're human.

421
00:29:03,256 --> 00:29:05,016
Welcome to the club.

422
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:06,410
Thanks.

423
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,066
Except I used to belong
to a much better club.

424
00:29:11,524 --> 00:29:13,229
And now i'm powerless...

425
00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:14,829
I'm hapless, I'm hopeless.

426
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:17,914
Why the hell not bury myself

427
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,216
in women and decadence, right?

428
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,310
It's the end, baby.
That's what decadence is for.

429
00:29:23,435 --> 00:29:26,243
Why not bang a few gongs
before the lights go out?

430
00:29:27,802 --> 00:29:29,111
But, then...

431
00:29:30,494 --> 00:29:32,528
That's just how I roll.

432
00:29:54,964 --> 00:29:57,168
There.
Second-floor window.

433
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,462
We go in there.

434
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,484
You sure about this?

435
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:03,384
They'll never see us coming.

436
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:05,678
Trust me.

437
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:08,729
Now, weapons check.
We're on the move in five.

438
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:11,037
Hey... me.

439
00:30:11,706 --> 00:30:13,665
Can I talk to you for a sec?

440
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:21,724
Tell me what's going on.

441
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:23,927
- What?
- I know you.

442
00:30:24,052 --> 00:30:26,529
You're lying to these people
and to me.

443
00:30:27,723 --> 00:30:28,878
Is that so?

444
00:30:29,003 --> 00:30:29,785
Yeah.

445
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:32,535
See, I know your lying expressions.

446
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,696
I've seen them in the mirror.

447
00:30:35,271 --> 00:30:37,107
Now, there's something
you're not telling us.

448
00:30:37,232 --> 00:30:38,877
I don't know what you're
talking about.

449
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:39,417


450
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:42,267
I don't seem to be the only member
of your posse with some questions.

451
00:30:42,392 --> 00:30:44,746
So maybe I'll just take my doubts
over to them.

452
00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:50,014
- What?
- Take a look around you, man.

453
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:53,290
This place should be
white-hot with crotes.

454
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:54,753
Where are they?

455
00:30:56,784 --> 00:30:58,710
They cleared a path for us.

456
00:30:59,686 --> 00:31:02,198
- Which means that this is...
- A trap... exactly.

457
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:03,864
Then we can't go through the front.

458
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:05,017
Oh, we're not.

459
00:31:05,142 --> 00:31:06,660
They are.

460
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:09,539
They're the decoys.

461
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:11,718
You and me... we're going in
through the back.

462
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:15,922
You mean you're gonna
feed your friends

463
00:31:16,047 --> 00:31:17,948
Into a meat grinder?

464
00:31:18,073 --> 00:31:19,754
Cass, too?

465
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,963
You want to use their deaths
as a diversion?

466
00:31:25,097 --> 00:31:27,253
Man, something is broken in you.

467
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:29,805
You're making decisions
that I would never make.

468
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,265
- I wouldn't sacrifice my friends.
- You're right. You wouldn't.

469
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:36,490
It's one of the main reasons
we're in this mess, actually.

470
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:40,977
These people count on you.
They trust you.

471
00:31:41,451 --> 00:31:44,068
They trust me to kill the devil
and to save the world.

472
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,999
And that's exactly
what i'm gonna do.

473
00:31:46,124 --> 00:31:48,269
No. Not like this, you're not.
I'm not gonna let you.

474
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:49,612
Oh, really?

475
00:32:27,328 --> 00:32:28,602
Hello, dean.

476
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:31,581


477
00:32:34,904 --> 00:32:36,120
Aren't you a surprise.

478
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,109
You've come a long way
to see this, haven't you?

479
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:48,394
Well, go ahead.

480
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:50,238
Kill me.

481
00:32:50,363 --> 00:32:51,756
Kill you?

482
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:58,517
Don't you think that would be
a little... redundant?

483
00:33:02,068 --> 00:33:03,479
I'm sorry.

484
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:06,066
It must be painful...

485
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,635
Speaking to me in this... shape.

486
00:33:10,394 --> 00:33:12,102
But it had to be your brother.

487
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:14,526
It had to be.

488
00:33:18,635 --> 00:33:20,926
You don't have to be
afraid of me, Dean.

489
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:24,443
What do you think I'm going to do?

490
00:33:26,043 --> 00:33:29,012
I don't know.
Maybe deep-fry the planet?

491
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:31,812
Why?

492
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,662
Why would I want to destroy
this stunning thing...

493
00:33:36,693 --> 00:33:40,259
Beautiful in a trillion
different ways...

494
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:44,355
The last perfect handiwork of god?

495
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:51,320
You ever hear the story
of how I fell from grace?

496
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,822
Good god. You're not gonna tell me
a bedtime story, are you?

497
00:33:54,754 --> 00:33:56,950
My stomach's almost out of bile.

498
00:33:57,216 --> 00:33:59,721
You know why god cast me down?

499
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:04,118
Because I loved him.

500
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:06,502
More than anything.

501
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:09,838
And then god created...

502
00:34:13,853 --> 00:34:14,593
... you.

503
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:18,416
The little...

504
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:21,551
Hairless apes.

505
00:34:23,012 --> 00:34:26,685
And then he asked all of us
to bow down before you...

506
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,441
to love you more than him.

507
00:34:31,118 --> 00:34:33,244
And I said, "father...

508
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,251
I can't."

509
00:34:36,661 --> 00:34:41,802
I said, "these human beings
are flawed, murderous."

510
00:34:43,264 --> 00:34:44,846
And for that...

511
00:34:46,075 --> 00:34:49,888
God had Michael cast me into hell.

512
00:34:51,244 --> 00:34:52,741
Now, tell me...

513
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,618
Does the punishment fit the crime?

514
00:34:57,649 --> 00:34:59,763
Especially when I was right?

515
00:35:01,662 --> 00:35:05,602
Look at what 6 billion of you
have done to this thing.

516
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:09,099
And how many of you blame me for it?

517
00:35:13,096 --> 00:35:15,773
You're not fooling me.
You know that?

518
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:19,127
With this
sympathy-for-the-devil crap.

519
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,813
I know what you are.

520
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:23,093
What am i?

521
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:24,872
You're the same thing, only bigger.

522
00:35:25,198 --> 00:35:26,998
The same brand of cockroach

523
00:35:27,123 --> 00:35:29,084
I've been squashing my whole life...

524
00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:36,467
An ugly, evil, belly-to-the-ground,
Supernatural piece of crap.

525
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:40,663
The only difference
between them and you

526
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:43,397
Is the size of your ego.

527
00:35:52,393 --> 00:35:54,359
I like you, dean.

528
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:58,030
I get what the other angels
see in you.

529
00:35:59,744 --> 00:36:00,905
Goodbye.

530
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:03,270
We'll meet again soon.

531
00:36:06,735 --> 00:36:08,583
You better kill me now!

532
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:13,879
- Pardon?
- You better kill me now.

533
00:36:14,264 --> 00:36:17,653
Or I swear,
I will find a way to kill you.

534
00:36:19,486 --> 00:36:21,846
- And I won't stop.
- I know you won't.

535
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:25,669
I know you won't say "yes"
to Michael, either.

536
00:36:26,347 --> 00:36:28,227
And I know you won't kill Sam.

537
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:30,943
Whatever you do...

538
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:35,797
You will always end up here.

539
00:36:35,922 --> 00:36:40,572
Whatever choices you make,
whatever details you alter,

540
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:43,190
we will always end up...

541
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:46,719
... here.

542
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,017
I win.

543
00:36:53,051 --> 00:36:54,366
So, I win.

544
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:58,357
You're wrong.

545
00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:03,554
See you in five years, Dean.

546
00:37:17,117 --> 00:37:17,650


547
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:27,369
If it isn't the ghost
of christmas "screw you."

548
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:28,589
Enough.

549
00:37:29,057 --> 00:37:30,246
Dean, enough.

550
00:37:31,704 --> 00:37:33,709
You saw it, right?
You saw what happens.

551
00:37:34,062 --> 00:37:36,294
You're the only person
who can prove the devil wrong.

552
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,132
Just say "yes."

553
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,817
How do I know that this whole thing
isn't one of your tricks?

554
00:37:42,671 --> 00:37:44,281
Some angel hocus-pocus?

555
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:46,048
The time for tricks is over.

556
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:48,891
Give yourself to Michael.

557
00:37:49,443 --> 00:37:51,884
Say "yes", and we can strike.

558
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,355
Before Lucifer gets to Sam.

559
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,398
Before billions die.

560
00:38:19,626 --> 00:38:20,707
Nah.

561
00:38:22,944 --> 00:38:24,008
"Nah"?

562
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,572
You telling me you haven't
learned your lesson?

563
00:38:27,697 --> 00:38:29,555
I've learned a lesson, all right.

564
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,467
Just not the one
you wanted to teach.

565
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:34,056
I'll just have to teach it again!

566
00:38:34,382 --> 00:38:35,966
Because I got you now, boy,

567
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:38,398
And i'm never letting you...

568
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,044
Son of a...

569
00:38:46,461 --> 00:38:48,302
That's pretty nice timing, Cass.

570
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:49,742
We had an appointment.

571
00:38:55,443 --> 00:38:57,478
Don't ever change.

572
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,149
How did Zachariah find you?

573
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:03,576
Long story.

574
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:07,029
Let's just stay away from jehovah's
witnesses from now on, okay?

575
00:39:08,087 --> 00:39:09,361
What are you doing?

576
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:12,092
Something I should have done
in the first place.

577
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:07,781
If you're serious
and you want back in...

578
00:40:10,851 --> 00:40:12,500
... you should hang on to this.

579
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,201
I'm sure you're rusty.

580
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:24,170
Look, man, I'm sorry.

581
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:28,967
I don't know.
I'm... whatever I need to be.

582
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,518
But I was, uh...

583
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:33,429
Wrong.

584
00:40:35,876 --> 00:40:37,639
What made you change your mind?

585
00:40:40,297 --> 00:40:41,948
Long story.

586
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:45,928
The point is...

587
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,321
maybe we are
each other's achilles' heel.

588
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,202
Maybe they'll find a way
to use us against each other.

589
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:53,612
I don't know.

590
00:40:56,797 --> 00:40:58,997
I just know we're all we've got.

591
00:41:03,757 --> 00:41:05,004
More than that.

592
00:41:07,642 --> 00:41:09,472
We keep each other human.

593
00:41:12,496 --> 00:41:13,553
Thank you.

594
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:17,373
Really.
Thank you.

595
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:20,519
- I won't let you down.
- I know it.

596
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:24,233
I mean, you are the second-best
hunter on the planet.

597
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,274
So, what do we do now?

598
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,698
We make our own future.

599
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:38,383
Guess we have no choice.
