00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:07,814
Synchro VO: IceFre@k

2
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,221
Radio around here sucks.

3
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:17,706
Come on man,
job's don't get much waver than this.

4
00:01:18,998 --> 00:01:22,382
Dead vic, with a hole on the neck,
body drained of blood,

5
00:01:22,502 --> 00:01:25,612
and a witness who swears up and down
that it was a vampire.

6
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:28,945
No, I... I agree.

7
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:30,593
It's a hell of a case.

8
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,748
A little more gusto, please.

9
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:38,069
It's just... the world
is coming to an end.

10
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,930
Things are a little complicated?

11
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,380
Yeah, well, we can't save the world,
not today anyway.

12
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,407
But what we can do is
chop off some vamps' heads.

13
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:48,069
Come on,
man, it's like the good old days.

14
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:50,254
An honest-to-goodness monster hunt.

15
00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:54,684
It's about time the Winchesters
got back to tackling

16
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:57,542
a straightforward, black-and-white case.

17
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:41,819
We still got to see
the new "raiders" movie.

18
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:42,998
Saw it.

19
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:45,379
Without me?

20
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,003
You were in hell.

21
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:49,095
That's no excuse.

22
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:53,738
Big pretzel!

23
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,319
Thank you.

24
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:02,165
Thank you.

25
00:03:04,971 --> 00:03:06,130
Guten tag.

26
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:09,317
"Guten tag" yourself.

27
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,451
Looks like that's our man.

28
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:22,914
Sheriff dietrich.

29
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:26,071
Are you the boys from the fed?

30
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:28,128
Agents angus and young.

31
00:03:28,473 --> 00:03:31,297
We called ahead about your, uh, problem.

32
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,148
Right. Um...

33
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:36,970
I'll tell you what, why don't we
talk this out away from the crowd, huh?

34
00:03:45,655 --> 00:03:49,415
Marissa wright,
26, just up from lockhard for the'fest.

35
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:52,861
Terrible.

36
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,237
Just terrible.

37
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:58,316
It's the last thing this
town needs at peak tourist season.

38
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:02,495
Definitely the last
thing marissa wright needed.

39
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:09,137
- What the hell?
- Yeah, you got me --

40
00:04:09,257 --> 00:04:11,963
I mean, this killer's some
kind of grade-"a" wacko, right?

41
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:15,508
I mean, some satan-worshipping,
A. nne rice-reading, gothic,

42
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:16,968
psycho vampire wannabe.

43
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:20,259
Sheriff, in your report,
you mentioned a witness.

44
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:22,511
Yeah, I wished I didn't.

45
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:24,142
But our witness insisted.

46
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,050
That's ed brewer.

47
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:28,479
Not exactly what you'd call reliable.

48
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:55,465
I remember you.

49
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,091
And I remember you...

50
00:04:57,211 --> 00:04:58,134
"jamie."

51
00:04:58,686 --> 00:05:00,332
I never forget a pretty...

52
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,140
Everything.

53
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:04,432
We're looking for ed brewer.

54
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:06,330
What do you want with ed?

55
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,800
Well, we are...

56
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:10,441
... federal agents.

57
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,643
Mr. Brewer was witness
to a serious crime. We just --

58
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:15,360
Wait a minute.
You're a fed?

59
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:18,978
Wow, you don't come on like a fed.

60
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:21,699
Seriously?

61
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:26,204
I'm a maverick, ma'am.

62
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,895
A rebel with a badge.

63
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:30,907
One thing I don't play by --

64
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:32,197
The rules.

65
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,200
Okay, maverick.

66
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,178
Um, so, where can we find Mr. Brewer?

67
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,104
I told the cops everything I saw.

68
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,103
No one believes me.

69
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:57,193
Why should you be any different?

70
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,251
Believe me, Mr. Brewer, we're different.

71
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:05,660
I spoke the god's honest truth,
and now I'm the town joke.

72
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,105
Marissa wright's
murder is no joke to us.

73
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,997
And we want to hear everything,
no matter how strange it may seem.

74
00:06:12,117 --> 00:06:14,502
We have a lot of
experience with strange.

75
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:27,237
It was just after midnight.

76
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:29,961
I just left here,
and like I do every night,

77
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:32,061
I cut through the park on the way home.

78
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,939
At first,
I thought it was a couple kissing.

79
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,605
But she was...

80
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,684
Struggling too much.

81
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:43,088
And this man,
he was...

82
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:46,106
He was biting her neck.

83
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,870
Can you describe her assailant?

84
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,329
Oh, he was a vampire.

85
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,083
Okay, right.
And by that, you mean --

86
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:56,234
You know, a vampire.

87
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:01,549
- So, he looked like...
- He looked like a vampire

88
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:04,201
you know, with the fangs
and the slicked-back hair

89
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:07,180
and the fancy cape and the little
medallion thingy on the ribbon.

90
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:10,461
- You mean like a dracula?
- Exactly.

91
00:07:10,704 --> 00:07:11,934
Like a dracula.

92
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:14,353
Right down to the accent.

93
00:07:14,513 --> 00:07:16,314
- The accent.
- Yep.

94
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:19,391
What did he say?

95
00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:21,322
You know, something like...

96
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:24,363
"stay away, mortal!

97
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:26,951
The night is mine!"

98
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:33,433
You do believe me, don't you?

99
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:39,837
They must be here following
up on that murdered woman.

100
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:42,273
Crazy ed and his vampire story.

101
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:44,651
He might be weird, but he's not crazy.

102
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:47,009
You're just saying that 'cause
the guy has a crush on you

103
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,471
and he tips you in $20s.

104
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:50,874
Lucy.

105
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,562
So, you got a beer back there for me?

106
00:07:56,722 --> 00:07:58,397
I don't know, agent young.
You off duty?

107
00:07:58,557 --> 00:07:59,642
And then some.

108
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:06,739
So, what do you think?

109
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:09,617
Goth, psycho vampire wannabe, right?

110
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:11,459
Definitely not our kind of case.

111
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:12,579
Agreed.

112
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:14,281
But who cares?

113
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:18,680
Room's paid for, and it's oktoberfest.

114
00:08:19,086 --> 00:08:20,269
Come on, brother.

115
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:21,961
Beer and bar wenches.

116
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:25,466
Pretty sure women today don't
react well to the whole "wench" thing.

117
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,408
Hey, bar wench, where's that beer?

118
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:31,013
Coming up, good sir!

119
00:08:33,877 --> 00:08:35,852
Dude, oktoberfest.

120
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:38,287
There you go.

121
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,761
What can I get you?

122
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,107
Oh, he doesn't drink.

123
00:08:41,548 --> 00:08:42,898
He's a christian scientist.

124
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:44,443
Doesn't even take aspirin.

125
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,821
He's a real drag on stakeouts.

126
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:48,197
You're funny.

127
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:49,782
I'm a lot more than that.

128
00:08:50,144 --> 00:08:52,023
I'd love to get a chance
to show you the rest.

129
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:53,571
What time you get off?

130
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,246
Like I said, "funny."

131
00:08:58,783 --> 00:09:01,029
Man, it is time to right some wrongs.

132
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,044
Come again?

133
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:04,727
Look at me.

134
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,842
I came back from the furnace
without any of my old scars, right?

135
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:11,038
You know, bullet wounds, knife cuts,

136
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:13,337
none of the off-angled fingers
from all the breaks.

137
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:15,308
My hide is as smooth
as a baby's bottom,

138
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:17,018
which leads me to conclude,

139
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:19,007
sadly...

140
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:22,397
That my virginity is intact.

141
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:24,150
What?

142
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,194
- I have been re-hymenated.
- Re...

143
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:28,863
please.

144
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,158
Dean, maybe angels can pull you
out of hell, but no one could do that.

145
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:34,988
Brother, I have been re-hymenated.

146
00:09:35,343 --> 00:09:37,413
And the dude will not abide.

147
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,871
All right, dude.

148
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:41,834
Well, you go do whatever
you got to do, and I'm gonna go

149
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:44,112
back to the room and get some sleep.

150
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:53,005
So?
How'bout tonight?

151
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,348
Oh, sorry.
I promised lucy a girls' night out.

152
00:09:57,486 --> 00:09:59,477
Besides, no self-respecting

153
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:02,962
bar wench lets herself get picked up
by a customer on the first try.

154
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:05,191
Well, I'm not a customer.
I'm a federal agent.

155
00:10:05,927 --> 00:10:08,402
- Try again tomorrow, g-man.
- I wish I could.

156
00:10:08,562 --> 00:10:10,624
I don't think we're staying on the case.

157
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,443
Is it too weird for you?

158
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,495
Not weird enough.

159
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
Rick.

160
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,720
- Did you hear that?
- What?

161
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,055
It sounded like a wolf.

162
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,063
Come on,
Marie, don't change the subject.

163
00:10:39,183 --> 00:10:41,269
I told you what could happen
to a man if he doesn't --

164
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:43,339
- Those stories aren't true.
- They are.

165
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:44,105
Baby,

166
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:48,234
if a man doesn't get the stuff out of
his system regularly, it can back up

167
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:49,811
and cause all kinds of...

168
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:52,071
Medical-type problems.

169
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,441
Do you hear that?

170
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:23,561
Anne marie,
there aren't any wolves in pennsylvania.

171
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:45,875
And then it just... it just
tore rick into little pieces.

172
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:51,839
Ma'am, we understand how hard this is,
but can you describe the creature?

173
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:58,408
It was a werewolf.

174
00:11:59,027 --> 00:11:59,889
A werewolf?

175
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,031
- You're sure?
- Oh, yeah.

176
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:04,977
With the furry face and the black nose

177
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:06,479
and the claws

178
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:09,163
and the torn-up pants and shirt,

179
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,775
like from the old movies.

180
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:18,918
Okay, so...

181
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:22,359
Thank you for your time.

182
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,780
First a dracula and now
a full-on movie-time wolf man?

183
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,693
What the hell is going on in this town?

184
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:48,646
Damn!

185
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:52,089
All right.

186
00:12:53,241 --> 00:12:56,153
Whatever did this
wasn't a psycho wannabe.

187
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:01,789
Look at those bite marks.

188
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:03,951
Right down to the bone...

189
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:05,713
And deeper.

190
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:08,407
Strong enough to tear a
healthy man apart limb from limb.

191
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:10,668
- Could be a werewolf.
- Yeah, except, look.

192
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:13,170
The heart's still there in one piece.

193
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,780
- They never leave the heart behind.
- Thus I reiterate --

194
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,751
What the hell is going on?

195
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:20,484
Well, I was hoping
you boys could tell me.

196
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:25,182
I just got a rush job back from the lab
on those fibers we found on the body.

197
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:28,959
Canine. Wolf hairs.

198
00:13:34,953 --> 00:13:36,528
I'm getting a headache.

199
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:46,111
I don't know, man.
Looks like we've stumbled on to a

200
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:49,039
midnight showing of
"dracula meets wolf man."

201
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:51,167
- Is that it?
- I don't know.

202
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:53,090
I mean, wolf man seems real enough.

203
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,421
It makes dracula seem a
little less impossible, I guess.

204
00:13:55,592 --> 00:13:58,215
But werewolves don't grow wolf hair.
That's just a myth.

205
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:01,093
So, what?
We've got a vampire

206
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:03,521
and a werewolf monster
mashing this town?

207
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,491
Looks like you guys
are staying a while.

208
00:14:08,611 --> 00:14:10,352
I heard about rick deacon.

209
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:12,855
Yeah, this case just got weird
enough for, uh, our department.

210
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,653
Well, beers are on me.

211
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:19,445
And, just so you know,
I get off at midnight tonight.

212
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,907
Oh, it's not another,
uh, girls' night out?

213
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:24,200
Doesn't have to be.

214
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:26,910
Okay, then.
I'll see you tonight.

215
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,030
Okay, then.

216
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,248
Hey, you think this dracula
could turn into a bat?

217
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,571
That would be cool.

218
00:15:00,738 --> 00:15:04,294
<i>I was just wondering if you were
expecting a delivery of some kind?</i>

219
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:06,682
<i>I don't know.</i>

220
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,100
<i>No, but it looks old.</i>

221
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,150
That's right.

222
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:14,475
Yeah, an egyptian kind of deal.

223
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:19,087
No, it was just sitting
there on the loading dock.

224
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:23,593
No, doctor, there's no shipping invoice.

225
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:24,909
There's no nothing.

226
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:26,881
I don't know when it was delivered.

227
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:30,742
It was here when I clocked in tonight.
I thought you'd know what to do.

228
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,700
You think helen has any
record of it in her files?

229
00:15:52,254 --> 00:15:54,039
Holy mother of crap!

230
00:16:46,276 --> 00:16:48,418
This sarcophagus isn't ancient.

231
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:50,763
It's from a prop house in philly.

232
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:58,957
It goes well with the bucket
of dry ice he was keeping in it.

233
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:02,386
Is he making his own special effects?

234
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:04,902
Yeah, a mummy with a
good sense of showmanship.

235
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:09,301
This is stupid.

236
00:17:10,653 --> 00:17:12,762
Oh, damn it. Jamie.
I'm late.

237
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:14,948
You're good here with
the mummy and the...

238
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,455
- Crazy...
- Yeah.

239
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:17,616
Yeah.

240
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,967
Your loss, g-man.

241
00:17:42,385 --> 00:17:43,357
Good evening.

242
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:56,755
I have watched you
many nights from afar.

243
00:17:57,865 --> 00:18:01,500
My passion knows no bounds, Mina!

244
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,632
You are the reincarnation of my beloved,

245
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,259
and I must have you.

246
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:13,714
Mary, son of a...

247
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:17,758
Jamie!

248
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,992
Son of a bitch.

249
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:25,701
You should not use such language
in the presence of my bride.

250
00:18:28,293 --> 00:18:29,361
Okay.

251
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:39,367
Jamie, run!

252
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,183
You have no choice in the matter,
Mr. Harker.

253
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,459
Mina is mine!

254
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:39,389
- You guys all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

255
00:19:40,922 --> 00:19:42,552
And I think I know what's going on.

256
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:43,672
Yeah?

257
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:45,251
Part of it at least.

258
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,025
The ear part?

259
00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:52,694
Ripped it off of dracula's head.
Touch it.

260
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:02,454
Feel familiar to you?

261
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,675
Oh, man.

262
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:08,055
The skin of a shapeshifter, just
like st. Louis and just like milwaukee.

263
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:10,952
Of course this one's
all holding buckets of crazy.

264
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:12,697
Oh, and, uh...

265
00:20:14,638 --> 00:20:18,512
This, I pulled it off during the fight.
Look at the label on the ribbon.

266
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:23,788
It's a costume rental.

267
00:20:23,908 --> 00:20:26,645
All three monsters...
The dracula, wolf man, and the mummy...

268
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:29,857
All the same critter, which means we
need to catch this freak before he

269
00:20:30,017 --> 00:20:32,281
"creature from the black lagoon's"
somebody.

270
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:35,513
So, you guys are like mulder and scully
or something, and...

271
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,331
the x files are real?

272
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:41,410
No, "the X-Files"
is a TV show. This is real.

273
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:47,996
Okay, so, the stagecraft,
the costuming...

274
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:51,247
It's like he's trying to reenact
his favorite monster-movie moments,

275
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:53,130
right down to the bloody murders.

276
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:55,340
Wait a second.
Who the hell is mina?

277
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:56,966
- Mina?
- Yeah.

278
00:20:57,086 --> 00:20:59,384
- That's what he called jamie.
- And he called me mr. Harker.

279
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:00,554
Jonathan harker?

280
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:05,282
They're characters from
the movies and the novels --

281
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:07,725
Mina, dracula's intended bride,

282
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:10,030
harker, the fiancé
that stands in the way.

283
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:14,234
Seems like he's fixating on you,
like he sees you as his bride.

284
00:21:14,593 --> 00:21:16,544
Wow. Lucky me.

285
00:21:17,204 --> 00:21:19,826
But to fixate on you,
my guess is that the shifter

286
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:23,031
has to have seen you before
or been around you.

287
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:25,537
Jamie, has anybody strange come to town,

288
00:21:25,697 --> 00:21:27,944
somebody that has taken
a specific notice of you?

289
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:30,154
I don't know, dean.
It's oktoberfest.

290
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:32,127
I'm a bartender.

291
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:35,769
There's lots of people.
I...

292
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:39,009
Wait a second.
There is ed.

293
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:40,218
"Ed brewer" ed?

294
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Yeah.

295
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:46,391
He moved here about a month ago.
Lucy swears he has a crush on me.

296
00:21:47,101 --> 00:21:49,019
He comes in almost every night.

297
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,689
- I don't think he's the type of guy...
- Where does ed live?

298
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:54,630
I don't know.

299
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:56,818
But he works at the old movie theater.

300
00:21:56,978 --> 00:21:59,163
I think he's a projectionist there.

301
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,366
- Take care of mina?
- Yep.

302
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,997
So, monsters are real.

303
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:13,005
Some of them, yeah.

304
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,785
And the shapeshifter,
he can turn into different people.

305
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,111
Yeah.

306
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:21,256
Yeah, except this one's turning into the

307
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:24,096
the great monsters of screenland,
which is a new one for me.

308
00:22:26,641 --> 00:22:28,785
You're not really fbi, are you?

309
00:22:30,776 --> 00:22:31,904
Not so much.

310
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:35,411
So, this is what you do?

311
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:37,422
You and your partner just

312
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:40,522
tramp across the country
on your own dime until

313
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:43,244
you find some horrible
nightmare to fight?

314
00:22:45,713 --> 00:22:47,255
Some people paint.

315
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,956
What?

316
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:53,618
That must suck.

317
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:54,841
I mean,

318
00:22:55,588 --> 00:22:58,296
you're giving up your life
for this terrible...

319
00:22:59,064 --> 00:23:01,133
I don't know, responsibility.

320
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:08,788
Last few years,

321
00:23:09,173 --> 00:23:11,034
I started thinking that way,

322
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:16,246
and, uh, you know,
it started sort of weighing on me.

323
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,776
Of course, that was before...

324
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,062
a little while ago, I had this --

325
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:36,689
It's called a near-death experience.

326
00:23:37,513 --> 00:23:38,595
Very near.

327
00:23:42,786 --> 00:23:43,786
And, uh...

328
00:23:46,261 --> 00:23:47,867
... when I came to...

329
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:50,732
Thin were different.

330
00:23:52,317 --> 00:23:54,024
My life's been different.

331
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,946
I realize that I help people.

332
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,531
Not just help them, though.
I save them.

333
00:24:02,911 --> 00:24:04,099
I guess it's --

334
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:05,739
It's awesome.

335
00:24:09,088 --> 00:24:10,795
It's kind of like a gift...

336
00:24:13,823 --> 00:24:14,941
Like a mission.

337
00:24:17,694 --> 00:24:18,783
Kind of like a...

338
00:24:19,797 --> 00:24:21,281
A mission from god.

339
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:28,191
So, does that make you...

340
00:24:29,105 --> 00:24:31,300
Some kind of monk or something?

341
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:34,744
You know, celibate?

342
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,630
Man, I hope not.

343
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:56,289
Holy crap.
Oh, my god. Jamie.

344
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,708
Guys, I'm -- I'm sorry.

345
00:24:58,868 --> 00:25:01,760
- I thought you guys were going out.
- Lucy, it's -- it's okay.

346
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,850
- Uh, listen --
- You know what? I just --

347
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,311
I came to borrow a bottle.

348
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:07,801
I kind of got something
going back at my...

349
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,937
Anyway, uh, you guys look really busy,
so I'm just...

350
00:25:14,161 --> 00:25:15,573
gonna get out of your hair.

351
00:25:15,693 --> 00:25:18,581
Seriously,
lucy, it's been a crazy night.

352
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:19,993
Stay for a drink.

353
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:22,610
Yeah.
Stay for a drink.

354
00:26:34,503 --> 00:26:36,229
You, FBI man --
What did I --

355
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:38,041
Shut up, okay, you know what you did.

356
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:39,684
- What?
- I know what you are.

357
00:26:39,844 --> 00:26:42,240
I'm not anything.
I just like to play the casio.

358
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,950
- Had time to grow the ear back, huh?
- What?!

359
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:52,405
- It's supposed to come off.
- No, it's not!

360
00:26:56,355 --> 00:26:57,790
Oh, that sounds awful.

361
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,608
Jamie, honey, are you okay?

362
00:26:59,728 --> 00:27:01,496
I am fine.

363
00:27:01,842 --> 00:27:03,333
He didn't even touch me.

364
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:07,003
Dean, he just blew right
in and fought him off.

365
00:27:07,163 --> 00:27:10,215
Well, I didn't actually fly, but
I'm sure it

366
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,842
seemed that way at the time.

367
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:14,844
It was really, really something.

368
00:27:16,614 --> 00:27:17,651
Jamie?

369
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:22,394
So, dean,
are you like a black belt or what?

370
00:27:28,977 --> 00:27:31,653
Well, I guess they train you
to fight at the academy or whatever.

371
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,212
Dean, what are you doing?

372
00:27:44,983 --> 00:27:46,084
It's you, isn't it?

373
00:27:55,683 --> 00:27:57,004
Oh, damn it!

374
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:01,698
What did you put in the drinks?!

375
00:28:04,472 --> 00:28:05,537
That's all right.

376
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:07,731
I'll skin you myself.

377
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:17,966
And... scene.

378
00:28:47,717 --> 00:28:48,958
Oh, come on.

379
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:03,985
She is beautiful, no?

380
00:29:05,804 --> 00:29:08,476
Bride number three from the first film.

381
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:14,095
She never got the acclaim
that she deserved.

382
00:29:16,117 --> 00:29:20,416
Which is why I chose her shape,
her form to

383
00:29:20,536 --> 00:29:22,806
move among the mortals unnoticed,

384
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:27,710
to listen to the cricket
songs of the living.

385
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,817
That is when I discovered my bride

386
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,401
had been reborn

387
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:36,571
in this century.

388
00:29:38,565 --> 00:29:40,657
I can't get over what
a pumpkin-pie-eyed,

389
00:29:40,817 --> 00:29:43,701
crazy son of a bitch you really are.

390
00:29:44,091 --> 00:29:45,706
You're not dracula.

391
00:29:46,347 --> 00:29:47,455
You get that, right?

392
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:51,626
Or even if you think you are dracula,
what the hell's up with the mummy?!

393
00:29:53,968 --> 00:29:57,132
I am all monsters!

394
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,369
Life ain't a movie, you sorry sack of --

395
00:30:02,604 --> 00:30:03,604
Life...

396
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:06,015
is small,

397
00:30:07,084 --> 00:30:07,934
meager,

398
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:09,558
messy.

399
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,856
The movies are grand,

400
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:14,516
simple,

401
00:30:14,908 --> 00:30:15,908
elegant.

402
00:30:16,371 --> 00:30:18,695
I have chosen...

403
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:20,613
elegance.

404
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,885
You think "elegance" is really the word

405
00:30:25,338 --> 00:30:26,786
for what you did to marissa

406
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,873
or rick deacon or any of the others?!

407
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,481
But of course.

408
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:36,212
It is a monster movie, after all.

409
00:30:36,372 --> 00:30:39,924
You do realize what happens
at the end of every monster movie?

410
00:30:42,088 --> 00:30:43,606
But this movie...

411
00:30:43,992 --> 00:30:45,216
is mine

412
00:30:47,152 --> 00:30:49,794
And in it, the monster wins.

413
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,604
The monster gets the girl.

414
00:30:54,702 --> 00:30:57,025
And the hero, he's...

415
00:30:58,796 --> 00:30:59,904
electrocuted.

416
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:05,675
And tonight, Jonathan Harker,

417
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,617
you will be my hero.

418
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:12,106
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

419
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:29,432
Please,

420
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,392
Excuse me.

421
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,831
Good evening.

422
00:31:57,698 --> 00:31:58,795
Pizza delivery.

423
00:31:59,202 --> 00:32:02,077
Ah, you've brought a repast.

424
00:32:02,615 --> 00:32:03,466
Excellent.

425
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:08,407
Continue to be of such service
and your life will be spared.

426
00:32:15,611 --> 00:32:17,105
That'll be $15.50.

427
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:19,274
- Tell me...
- Yeah?

428
00:32:19,434 --> 00:32:22,581
... is there garlic on this pizza?

429
00:32:25,588 --> 00:32:26,879
I don't know.

430
00:32:27,706 --> 00:32:29,826
- Did you order garlic?
- No!

431
00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:31,408
Then no.

432
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:33,945
Look, mister,
I got four other deliveries to make.

433
00:32:34,065 --> 00:32:36,583
You want to just pay
me the money so I can go?

434
00:32:36,743 --> 00:32:37,743
Of course. Yes.

435
00:32:40,496 --> 00:32:41,921
But I have a coupon.

436
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:55,595
Dean, hey,
listen, uh, ed is not our guy.

437
00:32:55,715 --> 00:32:59,937
Um, I'm guessing you're at home with
jamie, so just give me a call, okay?

438
00:33:11,026 --> 00:33:12,106
Lucy.

439
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:40,023
You wake.

440
00:33:42,499 --> 00:33:43,650
The gown --

441
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,737
It suits your beauty.

442
00:33:46,855 --> 00:33:48,655
Please, put it on.

443
00:33:50,589 --> 00:33:51,910
Where am i?

444
00:33:52,685 --> 00:33:54,160
What have you done with dean?

445
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,372
Harker is resting elsewhere.

446
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,458
Please, put on the
gown and

447
00:34:00,618 --> 00:34:01,868
you may dine.

448
00:34:02,351 --> 00:34:04,462
We are having pizza.

449
00:34:08,142 --> 00:34:09,008
What?

450
00:34:09,273 --> 00:34:11,102
What is wrong with you?

451
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,887
You made up lucy, right?

452
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,433
Pretended to be my friend.

453
00:34:18,215 --> 00:34:22,271
- I needed to know if you were the one.
- You could try talking to people!

454
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:24,565
But instead you become this?

455
00:34:25,368 --> 00:34:28,069
- The gown.
- I don't want to play your stupid game.

456
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:29,737
Okay, I just...

457
00:34:30,846 --> 00:34:32,490
I just want to go home.

458
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,016
Put on the gown!

459
00:35:21,072 --> 00:35:22,413
I-I scared you.

460
00:35:25,228 --> 00:35:27,044
You were the only one
I don't want to scare.

461
00:35:39,424 --> 00:35:40,892
I used to love the movies.

462
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,783
They aren't real.

463
00:35:44,616 --> 00:35:46,536
You can't make them real.

464
00:35:48,497 --> 00:35:49,497
"Real"...

465
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,338
is being born this way.

466
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,420
Different.

467
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:58,464
"Real" is having

468
00:35:59,176 --> 00:36:01,553
your dad call you "monster" --

469
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,277
It's the first time you hear the word --

470
00:36:04,397 --> 00:36:07,477
And he tries to beat
you to death with a shovel.

471
00:36:09,022 --> 00:36:11,297
Everywhere I ran, everywhere
I tried to hide,

472
00:36:11,928 --> 00:36:15,169
people found me, dragged me out
and attacked me,

473
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,675
called me "freak,"

474
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:20,880
called me "monster."

475
00:36:25,035 --> 00:36:27,454
Then I found them.

476
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,724
The great monsters.

477
00:36:34,435 --> 00:36:37,913
In their movies, they were strong.

478
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:39,333
They were feared.

479
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,981
They were beautiful.

480
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,111
And now I am like them.

481
00:36:48,994 --> 00:36:50,305
Commanding.

482
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:54,532
Terrifying.

483
00:36:56,419 --> 00:36:57,343
Lonely.

484
00:36:58,661 --> 00:37:00,059
Was lonely.

485
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:03,722
Now I --

486
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:06,074
I have you.

487
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,931
Ever think that maybe you're
lonely because you kill people?

488
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:15,057
Or I kill people because I'm lonely.

489
00:37:18,878 --> 00:37:20,188
Did you hear that?

490
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:21,595
What?

491
00:37:41,663 --> 00:37:43,907
Oh, thank god.
Just in the nick of time.

492
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:46,447
That guy was about to frankenstein me.

493
00:37:53,285 --> 00:37:55,099
- Hey there, handsome.
- Shut up!

494
00:38:13,098 --> 00:38:14,145
Let's go.

495
00:38:30,805 --> 00:38:33,257
You will never be van helsing!

496
00:38:38,845 --> 00:38:42,198
And you, harker, now you die.

497
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:47,725
How'bout now you shut the hell up?

498
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:01,384
Silver?

499
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:15,025
It was beauty...

500
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,307
that killed the beast.

501
00:39:20,573 --> 00:39:23,531
No, mina, do not weep.

502
00:39:28,591 --> 00:39:29,922
Perhaps...

503
00:39:30,674 --> 00:39:32,838
this is how

504
00:39:33,284 --> 00:39:35,500
the movie should end.

505
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:05,723
Well, thank you, g-man.

506
00:40:05,843 --> 00:40:08,617
You have been a great
service to your country.

507
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:12,253
Oh, yes, I'm very, very patriotic.

508
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:19,085
Bye.

509
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,670
Bye.

510
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:28,754
You guys saved my life, you know?

511
00:40:29,536 --> 00:40:31,720
So, thanks.

512
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,470
I like her.

513
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,539
Feels good to be back on the job,
doesn't it?

514
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:40,726
Yeah, it does.

515
00:40:40,846 --> 00:40:43,287
The hero gets the girl,
monster gets the gank --

516
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,326
All in all, happy ending --

517
00:40:46,065 --> 00:40:47,612
With a happy ending, no less.

518
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:49,819
Real classy, dean.

519
00:40:49,939 --> 00:40:52,850
Hey, all I'm saying is the
shifter man had a point, you know?

520
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,242
It would be nice if
life was movie simple.

521
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,408
Although, if I was turning life
into a movie,

522
00:40:57,528 --> 00:41:00,336
I wouldn't do this "abbott and costello
meet the monster" crap.

523
00:41:00,496 --> 00:41:02,883
Yeah. No, I know what you'd pick.

524
00:41:04,082 --> 00:41:05,209
No, you don't.

525
00:41:06,682 --> 00:41:07,551
Yeah, I do.

526
00:41:07,711 --> 00:41:08,719
No, you don't.

527
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,349
- You don't.
- "Porky's II."

528
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,807
- What?
- You heard me.

529
00:41:16,964 --> 00:41:18,509
Lucky guess.
