3
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,230
Knock,knock. I'm not doing it.

4
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,030
Who's there? Handsome.

5
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,690
Handsome who?

6
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,190
Handsome cereal to me.

7
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,240
Knock,knock. Okay,who's there? 
And this better be funny.

8
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,530
Gorilla. I can't believe 
I'm doing this.

9
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,680
Gorilla who?

10
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,700
Gorilla me a cheese sandwich!

11
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,750
That isn't funny.

12
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,930
Well,I think it is.

13
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,280
Well,it isn't. Well,it is. 
Marie thinks it's funny.

14
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,340
What is going on?

15
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,680
It's like you've 
left me for dead.

16
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,040
Hmm? No. You just 
looked so cozy.

17
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,550
All bundled up there 
in your blankets.

18
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,290
I just thought I'd give you 
a couple of extra minutes.

19
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,830
Cozy? I was freezing.

20
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,730
Yeah? Were-Were you 
guys freezing?

21
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,080
Oh,never mind.

22
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,520
So,is this a bad time 
to talk to you guys

23
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,900
about an idea I had for summer?

24
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,170
JOE: I think this would 
be an excellent time

25
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,750
to talk about an idea that 
you had for summer.

26
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,550
Warm Mommy up.

27
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,640
* Ha,ha, ha,ha. *

28
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,630
What's your idea?

29
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,080
Well,Hannah and Celeste are 
going to Camp Redrock,

30
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,160
and I was thinking maybe

31
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,010
I could go,too.

32
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,710
Camp Redrock?

33
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,070
I don't think I've ever 
heard of Camp Redrock.

34
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,950
Is it around here?

35
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,960
It's a sleep-away 
camp in Flagstaff,

36
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,790
and they have horse riding and
 canoe trips and campfires

37
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,410
and overnight trips.

38
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,980
Sounds expensive.

39
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,590
ARIEL: Thing is, I've never been

40
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,740
to sleep-away camp,and since 
my friends are going,

41
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,840
and this might be 
the last summer

42
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,020
before I'm really too old...

43
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,570
Um,let Mommy and 
me talk about it.

44
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,600
I'll call them up, or I'll 
look them up on-line,

45
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,780
and we'll figure it out.

46
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,580
See where it is, 
how much it costs.

47
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,380
ALLISON: Oh,hey,guys,

48
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,260
come on,we got to 
get cleaned up,

49
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,050
ready for school.

50
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,000
Come on.

51
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,670
Knock,knock.

52
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,610
MARIE: Who's there?

53
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,050
Fig.

54
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,430
Fig who?

55
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,720
ARIEL: Fig my little sister's 
got something broken

56
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,710
inside her brain.

57
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,650
BRIDGETTE: Hey!

58
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,010
So?

59
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,230
Hmm.

60
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,230
So,you're ready for this?

61
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,320
Yeah.

62
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,020
As ready as I'll ever be.

63
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,650
Welcome back,Joe.

64
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,470
Thank you.

65
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,480
Just a little something.

66
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,930
Uh. Hi,Mr. Canty.

67
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,620
Joe.

68
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,750
We've all been,uh, 
thinking about you.

69
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,930
I appreciate that.

70
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,840
If you need anything.

71
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,830
No,I'm fine.

72
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,150
Okay.

73
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,840
Okay.

74
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:07,870
<i>DEVALOS: Sorry to interrupt</i>

75
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,980
whatever the both 
of you were doing,

76
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,290
but the mayor's office 
just sent these over.

77
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,970
Jennie Heffernan?

78
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,990
DEVALOS: She's a college student, 
but she has been missing

79
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,920
for a day and a half. 
A day and a half?

80
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,540
She's in college-- 
that's not missing; 
that's sobering up.

81
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,530
I'm guessing you're right,

82
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,100
but the mayor's office seems 
to feels otherwise.

83
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,390
The folks she works with

84
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,170
at some off-campus coffee 
place are very concerned.

85
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,960
Apparently,they 
went to the police

86
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,470
and didn't get a whole 
lot of satisfaction.

87
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,660
Then they started calling 
and e-mailing the mayor...

88
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,710
Who started calling you.

89
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,160
So,not only does 
she serve coffee,

90
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,700
but she's also got some juice.

91
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,340
Apparently, Jennie Heffernan is

92
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,530
a Phoenix Mayoral 
Scholarship winner

93
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,970
and a pretty amazing young lady.

94
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,020
She's very studious.

95
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,210
Never misses class, 
never misses work.

96
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,800
Her mother abandoned her when 
she was ten years old.

97
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,630
She was brought up in a 
series of foster homes,

98
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,330
but nonetheless, 
maintained an "A" average

99
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,740
all the way through high school, 
and,as I mentioned,

100
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,280
she's working her way 
through Mesa University

101
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,920
with the help of 
a little scholarship

102
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,900
from the mayor's office.

103
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,870
Now,they know that 
it's premature

104
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,030
to declare her officially missing,

105
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,510
but they asked if I 
could twist some arms,

106
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,790
put some feelers out there.

107
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,790
You just know she's 
in Vegas or Cabo

108
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,590
asking for a twist with that martini.

109
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,310
Well,the sooner 
you can confirm that,

110
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,680
sooner my phone 
will stop ringing.

111
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,190
Joe Dubois.

112
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,950
ALLISON: So,how's it feel?

113
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,980
Oh,it feels good.

114
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,110
Feels like I never went away.

115
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,290
Just getting a lot done.

116
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,290
I bet people

117
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,220
are making a fuss, 
that they're happy to see you.

118
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,180
Oh,they had a little 
banner in my office,

119
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,020
and Mr. Canty came by.

120
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,110
It was nice.

121
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,550
That is nice.

122
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,710
Oh,hey,you didn't happen 
to get a chance

123
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,160
to look up Redrock Camp on 
the Internet,did you?

124
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,740
Honey,I haven't had a chance 
to get to my computer

125
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,730
since I got back.

126
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,750
Yeah,well,I did,and

127
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,980
phew,it's darn expensive.

128
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,520
Oh,yeah? How expensive?

129
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,840
Really expensive.

130
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,810
Okay,well,we'll just have to 
sit down with her and explain

131
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,090
about money,cost of things,

132
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,960
the realities of living 
in a family of five.

133
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,220
I can do that if you like.

134
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,000
Honey?

135
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,900
Honey,can I call you back?

136
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,760
Sure.

137
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,780
This can't be happening.

138
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,930
Stop honking!

139
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,010
I can't see!

140
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,110
"Snow chains"?

141
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,510
Hello?

142
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,980
Hello?!

143
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,300
How in God's name does one

144
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,730
human being do that to another?

145
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,570
That's what everybody around 
here was wondering.

146
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,060
Won't have any answers

147
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,600
for three or four days,though.

148
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,110
I don't understand.

149
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,510
Can't very well perform an 
autopsy on a frozen body.

150
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,180
I recognize that,

151
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,760
but can 't we do something 
to speed this along?

152
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,810
Bring in heat? Melt the ice?

153
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,940
Whoever did this to her 
is almost certainly

154
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,890
still at large.

155
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,560
Hey,all those thoughts 
occurred to me.

156
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,690
The problem is,
 if we heat the body

157
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,160
or even just the ice around it

158
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,480
any potential evidence...

159
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,890
hair follicles, 
fibers from clothing,

160
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,360
skin cells under the nails--

161
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,200
it'll all be contaminated 
by the heat.

162
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,640
And if it isn't...

163
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,790
the lawyers representing

164
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,110
whoever did this are certainly

165
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,620
going to try to 
persuade the judge

166
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,090
or the jury otherwise.

167
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,680
So,what did the banner say?

168
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:43,970
ARIEL: What banner?

169
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,620
They made a banner for Daddy 
at work to welcome him back.

170
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,580
What's a banner? 
It's a thing

171
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,350
you hang from the ceiling 
with a big message on it.

172
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,530
Cool.

173
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,600
It said, "Welcome Back,Joe."

174
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,740
BRIDGETTE: Wow.

175
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,540
So... did they have a party?

176
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,050
No party.

177
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,490
But everyone was very nice.

178
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,520
They said they missed me

179
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,700
and said they were
 happy to see me.

180
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,280
Mostly they just 
let me do my work.

181
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,660
Catch up.

182
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,740
Left me alone.

183
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,390
Um... I know Mom was 
really busy and...

184
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,370
I know you were busy with 
catching up,but...

185
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,790
did either of you get a 
chance to look up Redrock?

186
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,180
JOE: Yeah,I think Mom did

187
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,810
when she was at 
work and I looked

188
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,160
on the Web site 
just before dinner.

189
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:25,760
What'd you think?

190
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,780
Pretty amazing,huh?

191
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,970
Well,it certainly was amazing.

192
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,490
Sweetie,you and I need

193
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,470
to talk after dinner.

194
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,080
Okay.

195
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,780
It's just I was talking 
to Celeste today

196
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,580
and she said that the group 
that she and Hannah are in

197
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,990
is filling up pretty 
fast and I just...

198
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,730
don't want to miss it.

199
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,360
That's all.

200
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,840
Hey.

201
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,310
Is this a good time?

202
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,470
Sure. Whatever.

203
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,420
I know what you're going to say.

204
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,550
You're going to say 
it's just too expensive.

205
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,930
Ariel...

206
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,340
I mean Hannah's parents aren't 
rich and she's going.

207
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,690
Yeah,but we don't know 
what her situation is.

208
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,710
We don't know who's paying.

209
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,230
Maybe her grandma and 
grandpa are helping out.

210
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,910
Maybe her parents feel 
differently about it.

211
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,610
I mean she's an only child.

212
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,950
Maybe they feel that this is an,

213
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,130
an important experience 
for her to have

214
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,020
with other girls this summer.

215
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,110
Great.

216
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,000
Lucky me.

217
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,580
Because I have Bridgette 
and Marie for sisters

218
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,700
I don't get to go to camp.

219
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,210
You know this isn't about 
Bridgette and Marie.

220
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,530
Nobody is against 
you going to camp.

221
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,980
But this place works out

222
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,840
at over thousand dollars a week.

223
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,160
And that's before we get you there

224
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,130
and we buy you the stuff 
that you need to bring.

225
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,070
And I'm sorry,honey,but 
that is a lot of money.

226
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,670
Yeah,well, I don't think so.

227
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,610
Well,I don't think that you 
are in a position to know.

228
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,090
Why?

229
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,340
Because I don't have a job?

230
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,720
I'm 14,Dad.

231
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,910
I know that.

232
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,350
And that is my point.

233
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,960
This is something that Mom 
and Dad need to decide

234
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,320
because we do know how hard it 
is to make and save money.

235
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,850
Because there have been times

236
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,480
in our lives... 
But I don't get that.

237
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,120
when we haven't had enough 
You work and Mom works

238
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,120
and you both work

239
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,010
for an emergency situation...

240
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,860
and you're gonna make money

241
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,170
and continue to 
make lots of money.

242
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,890
No!

243
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,850
You don't know that.

244
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,880
I know you're 14.

245
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,170
And you think that 
you know everything...

246
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,980
about us,about the world.

247
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,550
But you don't.

248
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,240
It could all change tomorrow.

249
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,340
You don't know.

250
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,600
Everything's locked.

251
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,710
Thermostat,double-checked.

252
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,130
Oldest daughter knows 
everything there is to know

253
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,140
about everything.

254
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,740
I take it the camp talk

255
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,210
didn't go well. Well....

256
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,140
we knew that she wasn't going 
to be happy about it.

257
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,820
But she was so...

258
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,500
blithe about the money,

259
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,080
blithe about my job,

260
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,690
blithe about the future.

261
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,440
You know,

262
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,020
it's hard being 
surrounded by people

263
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,510
who are so certain they know 
what's happening next,

264
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,830
when you don't.

265
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,380
I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.

266
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,380
I'm talking about the 
critical assumptions

267
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,770
that we all make as we 
go through our lives.

268
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,180
"Daddy will always have a job.

269
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,400
"Daddy will always have money.

270
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,780
Daddy will always be here."

271
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,150
She doesn't know that.

272
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,040
You don't know that.

273
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,120
Yeah,well,you're not planning 
on going anywhere,are you?

274
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,180
We have this contract--

275
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,140
all of us on earth--

276
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,370
that everyone will behave,

277
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,090
that everyone will be reasonable...

278
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,240
and rational...

279
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,580
that we will all take turns 
at a four-way stop sign;

280
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,090
that we won't play loud music

281
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,310
when the rest of the 
block is asleep...

282
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,030
that no one will 
bring a gun to work.

283
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,290
Hey.

284
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,000
I know.

285
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,930
2:45 in the morning.

286
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,570
I hope I didn't wake you.

287
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,410
Just wanted to make sure 
that when I came back,

288
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,590
we'd be alone.

289
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,580
Did you miss me?

290
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,540
No!

291
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,740
You just think of all 
the good times we had.

292
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,710
Calm down,Darling.

293
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,930
I know it's cold in there.

294
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,340
Here we go.

295
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,050
This should speed things along.

296
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,190
Lee? I'm sorry to wake you...

297
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,060
I think I just saw Jennie 
Heffernan's killer.

298
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,770
That's all right.

299
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,170
I haven't actually
 been to bed yet,

300
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,200
and oddly enough,

301
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,290
I'm about to see Jennie 
Heffernan's killer myself.

302
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,280
Excuse me?

303
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,890
I'm down here at the morgue.

304
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,570
Son of a bitch saved us all

305
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:14,850
a lot of trouble and 
killed himself la£ø£ø

306
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,320
???If the Idol is supposed 
to be American

307
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,790
then how come they have

308
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,000
that British guy do 
all the talking?

309
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,160
That's a good question,Bridge.

310
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,670
And how come you have

311
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,630
to wait till after 
the show to vote?

312
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,570
Don't they know that kids have 
to go to bed after the show?

313
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,730
I think they're afraid 
of what would happen

314
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,880
if kids got to vote.

315
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,290
ALLISON: I think you might 
have something there,Bridge.

316
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,730
Could I eat my toast in my room?

317
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,020
No.

318
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,530
I'm eating my toast in my room.

319
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,220
Yeah,it's nice to see you,too.

320
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,000
Is something going on?

321
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,230
Why'd you let me sleep?

322
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,090
To be mean.

323
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,740
It was fun watching you lay 
there,get some rest.

324
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,890
Your soul at peace.

325
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,670
God,I'm evil.

326
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,060
This family is weird.

327
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,930
Can me and Marie go get dressed?

328
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,150
I don't know?

329
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,660
Can you and Marie go get dressed?

330
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,300
Yeah,honey,go.

331
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,220
Go get dressed.

332
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,840
Hey,Mr. Happy?

333
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,740
You wanna talk?

334
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,510
Why'd you let me sleep?

335
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,280
Well,I was already up.

336
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,610
I've been up since 4:00.

337
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,600
I couldn't go back to sleep.

338
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,440
So,I thought,hey, 
why don't I make coffee.

339
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,920
Why don't I take 
care of the girls.

340
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,070
Give my favorite grump 
an 15 extra minutes

341
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,470
and you can thank me later.

342
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,300
Why are you up?

343
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,480
Well,this will 
shock and amaze you.

344
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,570
I had a dream.

345
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,250
I saw Jennie Heffernan's killer in it.

346
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,760
Mmm,yeah,I'm just reading about him.

347
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,350
Yeah,well,it turns out my 
dream was all for nothing.

348
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,540
They caught the guy.

349
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,990
He killed himself.

350
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,790
So,case is closed.

351
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,780
I'm still up.

352
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,160
It's his fault,right?

353
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,620
Wait a second.

354
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,860
That's not him.

355
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,800
<i>SCANLON: I don't know what 
to tell you, Allison.</i>

356
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,310
It doesn't get much 
neater than this.

357
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,880
The house where you 
discovered the body

358
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,750
was owned by this 
Brian Barbera fellow

359
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,810
who wasn't living there, 
but was doing work on it.

360
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,490
It turns out he and Jennie 
were seeing each other.

361
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,830
And you're sure 
he killed Jennie?

362
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,440
He left behind a juicy suicide 
note telling us

363
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,730
where to find the body and 
exactly how he did it.

364
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,790
Guess he didn't figure 
we'd find her first.

365
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,530
They found him in a pool 
of his own vomit.

366
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,460
The medical examiner said

367
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,850
his stomach was full of cyanide salt.

368
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,820
He just so doesn't look like 
the man in my dream.

369
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,010
Well,don't feel bad.

370
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,010
I guess he didn't turn 
out to be the man

371
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,930
of her dreams either.

372
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,950
Where's Mom?

373
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,220
She's taking a bath.

374
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,910
Why? You need help 
with your homework

375
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,760
or something?

376
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,580
You said the reason I couldn't 
go to Camp Redrock

377
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,570
was because it was too 
expensive,right?

378
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,230
Right. Well,what if 
I paid for it?

379
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,270
Ariel...

380
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,170
What? Is that such 
a hard question?

381
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,270
Okay,look,I know you're 
mad at me about this,

382
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,000
but you need to know something.

383
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,280
I'm starting to get mad at you.

384
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,620
"No" is something that 
you're going to hear

385
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,930
from time to time in your life

386
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,050
and the fact that 
you can't seem

387
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,600
to accept that concerns me a lot.

388
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,460
What's that?

389
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,010
It's the money for camp.

390
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,090
I found it.

391
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,010
This is a passbook...

392
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,230
for an account that your 
grandparents set up for you

393
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,120
when you were born.

394
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,500
Where'd you get this?

395
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,840
What difference does it make?

396
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,670
It has my name is on it. 
It's mine.

397
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,430
This was in my drawer.

398
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,500
What were you doing going 
through my things?

399
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,950
I didn't go through your things.

400
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,710
I knew right where it was, 
and I knew it was mine.

401
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,090
So I went in your room 
and I got it.

402
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,910
That's all.

403
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,810
It has my name on it, 
and it's my money.

404
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,220
There's almost $8,000

405
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,690
in there and I'm going 
to use it for camp.

406
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,530
It may have your name on it, 
but it is not your money.

407
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,270
Not until you turn 18.

408
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,910
And the fact that it 
has your name on it

409
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,490
is no excuse for you going 
through my drawer to get it.

410
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,200
How did you even
 know where it was?

411
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,260
I know lots of things,Dad.

412
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,310
Well,

413
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,360
no,you don't.

414
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,450
You don't know nearly as much 
as you think you do.

415
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,120
That money is for college.

416
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,340
Your grandparents

417
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,750
gave you that money for 
college,not for camp.

418
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,770
So that's it?

419
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,640
It's just "no" even though 
I have the money?

420
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,680
Yes,it's "no," and you 
don't have the money,

421
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,650
and you can't just 
go into my room

422
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,960
and take things without asking.

423
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,960
All right.

424
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,240
Is that everything?

425
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,000
It doesn't matter 
where you put it.

426
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,410
I'll still know where it is.

427
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,290
That's okay.

428
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,960
You don't need a passport 
to get in this bedroom.

429
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,260
Your driver's license will do.

430
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,190
No,it's not a passport; 
it's a passbook,

431
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,480
and it was in my drawer 
under a lot of socks,

432
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,470
and Ariel took it without 
my permission

433
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,920
to show me that she had the money

434
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,100
to pay for camp.

435
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,960
Whoo,this kid's rich.

436
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,880
That's not funny.

437
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,100
This is her college 
money from my parents.

438
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,610
Well,calm down.

439
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,620
I know what it is.

440
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,090
We both know she can't get 
any money out of the bank

441
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,180
without one of us.

442
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,990
And you know what?

443
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,970
She knows it,too.

444
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,970
She's just mad.

445
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,990
She's mad that she seems to have

446
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,500
so little control over her life.

447
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,870
She's mad that we seem to have 
so much control over her life.

448
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,220
So just come on. Relax.

449
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,430
Let's go to bed.

450
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,320
You know, in a couple of days,

451
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,490
everything will be back to normal.

452
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,310
She'll be fine.

453
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,660
No,I-I don't think I feel like 
coming to bed right now.

454
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,530
You always feel like coming to bed.

455
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,180
Is everything okay at work?

456
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,520
Everything's fine.

457
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,160
Is everything okay with us?

458
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,440
Everything is fine.

459
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,550
So all of this angst 
is about Ariel?

460
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,960
What are you trying to say?

461
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,670
I'm saying something seems wrong.

462
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,520
Everything is so serious.

463
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,670
You don't seem happy.

464
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,790
You know,this is the first time 
I can ever remember

465
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,040
you forgetting to ask 
me how my day was.

466
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,490
I didn't forget. I already know.

467
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,000
You had a dream. You told someone.

468
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,840
They didn't believe you,but it 
all worked out in the end.

469
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,030
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just... 
I'm mad.

470
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,120
I'm mad that I seem to have

471
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,980
so little control over my own life.

472
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,640
I guess I'll watch TV.

473
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,190
Bull's-eye.

474
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,280
Bull's-eye.

475
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,280
Bull's-eye.

476
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,080
MARIE: You're laying 
on my Mr. Snookie.

477
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,300
Must have fallen asleep watching TV.

478
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,420
Get ready for work.

479
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,050
Diamonds?

480
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,750
She finds them in this,t
his place,

481
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,290
this storage unit where I first 
saw her being killed.

482
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,710
Storage unit?

483
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,810
W-What are you talking about?

484
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,020
That's what I was 
trying to tell you.

485
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,410
The place where I saw 
her being killed

486
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,270
looks nothing like the place 
where I found her body,

487
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,600
and the man that I, 
I saw killing her

488
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,710
is not the same man

489
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,560
who committed suicide 
and left a confession.

490
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,470
Now I'm dreaming about 
these diamonds.

491
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,350
This dead girl is 
sending me messages

492
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,860
and I can't make 
any sense of them.

493
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,510
I feel like I have to get a 
better sense of who she is,

494
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,510
maybe talk to her friends 
or see where she lived.

495
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,770
Allison,this is a closed case.

496
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,590
Well,apparently

497
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,810
not to the victim or I'd be 
sleeping a whole lot better.

498
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,300
Well,the friends thing

499
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,390
isn't something that we can 
make happen quickly.

500
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,620
Maybe I can get you 
into her apartment.

501
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,260
Would you mind going by yourself?

502
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,460
I'm not sure that I can afford

503
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,060
to assign a detective 
to something that,

504
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,340
at least from a legal standpoint,

505
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,450
has already been resolved.

506
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,630
Okay,I'm fine with that.

507
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,090
Yeah,Jennie was a very nice girl.

508
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,980
She always paid her rent on time.

509
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,850
When the police told me

510
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,950
what happened, I was horrified.

511
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,240
I haven't touched the place yet.

512
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,320
They told me not to.

513
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,040
Uh... there you go.

514
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,430
Now it won't lock on you.

515
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,770
Thank you. I won't be long.

516
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,510
Hmm.

517
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,740
Oh.

518
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,100
Jennie.

519
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,800
I know this sounds strange, 
but I can actually see you.

520
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,690
I'm so sorry.

521
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,340
All that you've been through.

522
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,350
No one's life should end that way.

523
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,610
Who did this to you?

524
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,670
Was it Brian?

525
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,310
Why?

526
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,010
I want to bring you peace.

527
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,560
I want to bring you justice.

528
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,680
???

529
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,780
I'm confused.

530
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,070
You say the ghost of Jennie 
Heffernan did this to you?

531
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,160
Impressive,ghost packs 
a hell of a wallop.

532
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,030
<i>I said I thought it was the 
ghost of Jennie Heffernan.</i>

533
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,220
Obviously,I was mistaken.

534
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,700
She must have been hiding 
in here the whole time--

535
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,150
I don't know-- maybe in that closet.

536
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,490
She must have come out

537
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,870
when she heard me leave 
the first time.

538
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,890
Which begs the question: 
if Jennie is alive

539
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,440
and well enough to 
assault you,then...

540
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,400
Then who are we waiting to 
defrost at the morgue?

541
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,680
Well,what was she doing here?

542
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,760
What was she looking for?

543
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,450
Hey,w-will you pass me my purse?

544
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,760
Thanks.

545
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,700
I wonder if she was 
looking for this.

546
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:12,950
SCANLON: What's that?

547
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:13,910
I'm hoping it's the keys

548
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,200
to a storage space I've 
been dreaming about.

549
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,380
Hello?

550
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,150
MAN Mrs. Dubois, 
my name is Marcus Canty.

551
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,710
I work with your husband. 
Excuse me.

552
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,030
Is this a bad time?

553
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,990
Would it be better if
 I called you back?

554
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,120
No,this is an excellent time.

555
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,310
I'm having an excellent day.

556
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,480
This has to do with your 
husband,Mrs. Dubois.

557
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,630
Is he all right?

558
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,210
To be perfectly honest, 
I'm not sure.

559
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,780
I mean,he's here
 and he's fine,

560
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,290
but since he's come 
back to work,

561
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,420
he hasn't been attending 
any meetings;

562
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,240
he hasn't been making 
any phone calls;

563
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,180
and,uh, I talked to our IT guys

564
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:54,440
and even though he switches on
 his computer in the mornings,

565
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,990
he doesn't seem to be signing 
on to the company server.

566
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,940
Near as I can tell, he,uh,
sits in his office

567
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,880
with his door locked all day 
and does God knows what.

568
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,200
I feel very strongly

569
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,810
that perhaps we had him come 
back to work too soon.

570
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,110
I think perhaps he should 
see a professional,

571
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,500
a counselor or a therapist.

572
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,960
I can hear that I've 
caught you at work.

573
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,920
No,I'm gr... I'm very 
grateful for your call

574
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,640
and I'm thinking whatever you're 
thinking... i-it seems right.

575
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,220
ALLISON: Hiya.

576
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,940
Hi.

577
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,090
What you doing?

578
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,180
Just looking myself 
up on the Internet.

579
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,540
It's kind of frustrating, 
actually.

580
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,790
Apparently,
I don't exist,

581
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,910
although there is a 
guy with my name

582
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,390
who's all the rage in gay porn.

583
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,420
You doing anything interesting?

584
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,950
Nope,sitting in a car, 
driving across town with Lee,

585
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,340
talking to my husband.

586
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,190
Love you.

587
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,340
Love you.

588
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,410
Are you sure we shouldn't 
stop by an emergency room,

589
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,850
get a proper X- ray or something?

590
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,240
Nah,I'm fine. It's just my head.

591
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,910
There's nothing in there anyway.

592
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,350
Yeah,I know this girl.

593
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,620
I helped her load a freezer 
out of here last week.

594
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,130
She was Brian's girlfriend.

595
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,190
I mean,you know that.

596
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,310
It was in the papers.

597
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,080
She used to come around here a lot.

598
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,150
So this is definitely Brian 
Barbera's storage unit?

599
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,180
Has been ever since I worked here.

600
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,660
Kid came in like clockwork, 
every month to pay the rent.

601
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,920
Did you actually 
want to go inside?

602
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,470
If you do,there's something 
I have to ask you to sign.

603
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,370
Well,that's strange.

604
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,330
I take it back.

605
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:42,560
I guess Brian Barbera isn't 
the actual tenant of record

606
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,610
for this unit.

607
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,700
Then who was?

608
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,950
Somebody named Peter Barbera.

609
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,600
A brother maybe.

610
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,210
I don't think I've ever met him.

611
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,670
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

612
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,690
Your boss called.

613
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,820
They said they might 
want you to see someone.

614
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,570
Talk to someone.

615
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,160
I think it's a pretty good idea.

616
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,130
I'll get it.

617
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,040
Hello?

618
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,360
SCANLON: He's not the brother.

619
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,120
He's the father.

620
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,300
Excuse me?

621
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,980
Peter Barbera,the man who 
rents that storage unit--

622
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,240
he's the father,and he's been 
in prison almost eight years.

623
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,520
Okay.

624
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,770
Great story,too.

625
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,730
Got pulled over for a suspected DUI

626
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,890
and actually got into 
it with the officer.

627
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,690
I mean,big time:

628
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,390
blows to the head, 
then a high-speed chase.

629
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,680
I mean,this guy's desperate
 not to get arrested.

630
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,550
Turns out, it's his third strike.

631
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,840
Then,no sooner do they 
get him in the joint,

632
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,150
then he's picked 
out of a line-up

633
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,460
for a local diamond heist.

634
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,380
Have I got your attention?

635
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,050
They couldn't make it stick, 
never found the diamonds,

636
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,240
but on the surveillance 
video of the heist,

637
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,650
there is a man and a woman,

638
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,580
a woman with blond hair.

639
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,430
Your boss and I are 
setting up a visit

640
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,100
at Arizona Correctional with 
Mr. Barbera for tomorrow.

641
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,580
Care to join us?

642
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,230
Mr. Barbera, I'm Manuel Devalos,

643
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,090
District Attorney, 
the city of Phoenix.

644
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,040
These are my colleagues...

645
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,090
I really don't care.

646
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,420
They buried my son today.

647
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,100
You'd think they'd give 
a guy a day to mourn.

648
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,850
This should speed things along.

649
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,500
We're terribly sorry,
 Mr. Barbera.

650
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,910
Actually,he's the 
reason we're here.

651
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,070
How much do you know 
about your son's death?

652
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,590
He killed some girl.

653
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,340
Then he killed himself.

654
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,440
Can I show you a 
picture of this girl?

655
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,430
What'd you say her name was?

656
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,240
Jennie. Jennie Heffernan.

657
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,360
Very interesting girl.

658
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,720
Smart. Very smart,but had 
a very tragic life.

659
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,630
Her mother abandoned her 
when she was quite young.

660
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,720
For a while,her older sister 
Haley tried to raise her,

661
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,850
but then Haley got involved 
with a two-time loser

662
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,940
that liked to stick 
up jewelry stores.

663
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,540
Next thing you know, 
Haley's nowhere to be found,

664
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,760
and Jennie's all alone again.

665
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,690
Then she turned up dead,

666
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,850
and your son confessed 
in a suicide note.

667
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,360
Anyone tell you how 
he killed her?

668
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,890
Bound her up, stuffed 
her in a freezer,

669
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,980
doused her with water.

670
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,590
Pretty tragic,huh?

671
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,430
First the sister disappears.

672
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,390
Then Jennie's killed.

673
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,420
Then we realize that this

674
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,740
freezer wasn't always
 where we found it,

675
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,920
that up until recently,

676
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:50,400
it was in a storage 
unit you were renting.

677
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,460
Really?

678
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,350
Really.

679
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,660
And that got us to thinking.

680
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,630
What if Jennie's sister 
didn't disappear at all?

681
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,300
What if something far more dire

682
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,520
happened to her?

683
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,800
For that matter,

684
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,030
what if it wasn't Jennie 
in the freezer?

685
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,290
What if your son wasn't 
a killer at all?

686
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,920
SCANLON: You got to wonder what 
we'd find if we tore that place apart.

687
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,700
Think we'd find 
anything valuable?

688
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,160
Think there'd be any,uh-- 
I don't know-- diamonds maybe?

689
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,730
DEVALOS: In a few days,
 we'll be able to positively

690
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,270
identify the woman 
in that freezer.

691
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,700
I've got a very strong hunch

692
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,240
that it's not going to be Jennie,

693
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,080
but maybe her sister Haley,

694
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,110
and when we tie her murder to you,

695
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,750
I intend to seek the 
death penalty,unless

696
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,100
you start telling 
me what you know.

697
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,380
She got away with it.

698
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,470
The perfect murder.

699
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,680
She must have been 
planning it for years,

700
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,600
tracking down Peter 
Barbera's son Brian,

701
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,520
becoming his girlfriend,

702
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,510
getting the key to 
the storage unit...

703
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,170
finding the diamonds 
that her sister died for...

704
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,050
using her own sister's body

705
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,760
to make it look like she was dead

706
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,130
so no one would look for her.

707
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,080
All for those diamonds.

708
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,860
Night.

709
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,470
They almost don't seem real, Haley.

710
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,490
Yeah,they're real,Jen.

711
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,650
And you know what?

712
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,220
These little babies are going

713
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,870
to make all our dreams come true.

714
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,330
Haley,

715
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,420
pick those up.

716
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,660
Give them to me.

717
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,830
I'll be right back.

718
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,560
What are you talking about?

719
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,590
I just got off the 
phone with my fence.

720
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,720
He won't touch 'em 
till they cool down.

721
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:07,690
Two weeks at least.

722
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,590
I got to hide them.

723
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,460
Hide 'em?

724
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,270
Or run with them?

725
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,460
You want to come with me?

726
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,200
I got the perfect spot.

727
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,570
A real bull's-eye.

728
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,760
A little place where 
I keep my hunting gear.

729
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,200
Yes,as a matter of fact,I do.

730
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,600
Jennie,come on. 
Get up. Let's go.

731
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,070
Peter's got a place 
he needs us to go.

732
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,520
A real bull's-eye.

733
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,830
Whoa,whoa,wait. 
What are you doing?

734
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,770
The kid's in her pajamas.

735
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,310
It's the middle of the night.

736
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,950
This'll take 15 minutes.

737
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,350
Let's just go run over there.

738
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,730
I'll have you back in no time.

739
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,490
Jennie,we're going 
to be right back.

740
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,460
I want you to lock 
the door behind us

741
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,710
and don't open it for 
anyone,okay?

742
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,960
Okay.

743
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,340
What?

744
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,600
Don't worry about them.

745
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,770
I'll keep an eye on the 
diamonds for the both of us.

746
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,440
Are we rich now?

747
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,560
Sure we are.

748
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,810
Soon as we sell these diamonds,

749
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,840
we'll have everything 
and anything we want.

750
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,060
We'll be able to do anything,

751
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,480
go anywhere.

752
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,400
Even Mexico?

753
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,570
Even Mexico.

754
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,150
Be back soon.

755
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,200
Back soon.

756
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,030
Hello?

757
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,000
SCANLON: I'm sorry to 
call you this late,

758
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,090
but I thought you'd
 want to know.

759
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
Got a call from Customs.

760
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,330
She's already used her passport.

761
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:12,610
Mexico.

762
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,750
Based on the partial fingerprint 
we were able to get,

763
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,940
this is definitely 
Haley Heffernan.

764
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,590
Cause of death: suffocation. 
She drowned.

765
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,930
You mentioned on the phone

766
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,410
that in the course 
of your examination

767
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,570
you'd come across 
something unexpected.

768
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:26,730
Over here.

769
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,160
We found this 
during the autopsy.

770
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,480
When I examined the 
stomach contents

771
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,740
I found a latex balloon.

772
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,310
When I cut the balloon open...

773
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,400
I found these.

774
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,520
Oh,my God.

775
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,870
According to the boys 
in Robbery-Homicide,

776
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,510
they're real.

777
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,130
She swallowed the diamonds.

778
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,720
But if these are 
the real diamonds...

779
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,960
what did Jennie steal?

780
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,010
I don't know where 
you're from,miss,

781
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,760
but here in Tijuana we 
don't take too kindly

782
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:58,270
to somebody trying to 
pass off fake diamonds.

783
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,330
Fake?

784
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,450
What are you talking about fake? 
They can't be.

785
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,320
Fake. Glass.

786
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,990
Now leave.

787
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,540
Get out of here before 
I call the police.

788
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,830
But they can't be fake.

789
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,530
You don't understand.

790
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,410
I don't have anywhere to go.

791
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,590
I don't have any money.

792
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:18,660
<i>Policia?</i>

793
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,140
<i>Hay una gringa aqui 
muy suspiciosa.</i>

794
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,290
You okay?

795
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,110
Yeah.

796
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:33,850
Thanks for asking.

797
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,330
Yeah,I'm fine.

798
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,290
A bunch of things 
I couldn't figure out...

799
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,960
I think make sense.

800
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,860
How about you? Are you okay?

801
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,690
Yeah,actually.

802
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,670
I think for the first 
time in a while...

803
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,380
I feel fine,too.

804
