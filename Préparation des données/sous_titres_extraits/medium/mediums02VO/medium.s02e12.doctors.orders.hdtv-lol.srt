1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,184
Who might this be?

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:04,386
Looks familiar.

3
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:05,851
He and his friend
raped a young girl.

4
00:00:05,957 --> 00:00:07,989
Sliced her open, took her apart.

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,520
Dr. Charles "The Butcher"
Walker of Wichita.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,774
Wanted dead or alive for the maniacal evisceration
of three unmarried daughters from the Great Plains.

7
00:00:15,965 --> 00:00:20,280
He was captured and lynched by an angry mob
in 1902- pretty good match, right?

8
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:25,555
1934: Dr. Eric Lorenz murdered a 16-year-old patient
who was complaining of swollen tonsils.

9
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:26,851
He said he heard voices.

10
00:00:26,952 --> 00:00:30,979
1950, Dr. Kevin Diebold raped and murdered
a 12-year-old patient

11
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,163
while her mother and two brothers
sat in the waiting room.

12
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:34,817
- He said he heard a voice.
- Interesting.

13
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:41,846
In 1960, Dr. Peter... Shonry raped and murdered
a 13-year-old in a public health clinic in Detroit.

14
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:44,023
There's another one in 1977.

15
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:46,003
You killed her in '91.

16
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:51,399
Seems like every 15 years or so,
someone hears a voice and a young girl dies.

17
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:54,751
Ladies.

18
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:57,153
If you'll kindly take a seat
in the waiting room,

19
00:00:57,254 --> 00:01:00,233
the doctor and I will finish up
and be with you shortly.

20
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:06,681
There you go, Mrs. Jorgensen.

21
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:09,825
I trimmed the fat off
just the way you like.

22
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,463
Thank you, dear.

23
00:01:11,564 --> 00:01:12,776
See you next week.

24
00:01:12,885 --> 00:01:13,487
Okay.

25
00:01:13,892 --> 00:01:15,951
Number 74.

26
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:18,850
Here.

27
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:21,476
What can I do you for, sir?

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,031
What's fresh today?

29
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,668
The veal cutlets are awfully nice.

30
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,584
Actually, I was looking for
something a little more exotic.

31
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:31,625
Hmm. Something exotic...

32
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:35,872
How about these?

33
00:01:36,354 --> 00:01:37,511
They're perfect for frying.

34
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:38,911
Nice.

35
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:41,129
How much would you
recommend per person?

36
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,487
As an appetizer, I mean.

37
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,582
A quarter pound each should do it.

38
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:46,151
Make it half a pound.

39
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:47,819
I'm entertaining a lady friend.

40
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,657
Something in mind
for a main course?

41
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,099
I'm not sure yet,
but I want it to be special.

42
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:59,571
We might have
just the thing for you, sir.

43
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:04,749
Oh, yeah.

44
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,238
That's perfect.

45
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:17,042
My gal's gonna love that.

46
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:20,785
Isn't that right, love?

47
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:23,899
Isn't that right... Allison?

48
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:34,113
You doing okay?

49
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,584
I just nodded off for a second.

50
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,932
It was him again.

51
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:44,842
He's back. I know it.

52
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:50,262
Allison, I need you to focus
on what's happening right here, right now.

53
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,674
You're right.

54
00:02:53,745 --> 00:02:56,008
Did the district attorney's office call?

55
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,884
Did Devalos call?

56
00:02:57,985 --> 00:03:02,105
Yeah. He said he felt terrible about it.

57
00:03:02,263 --> 00:03:05,646
He said he... he wished
you could understand.

58
00:03:05,747 --> 00:03:07,995
But he said there's
nothing he can really do.

59
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:09,410
At least not tonight.

60
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:12,062
Of course.

61
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,632
Right. Uh...

62
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,876
Well, in that case, I think
we should get this over with.

63
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:33,078
Pursuant to the penal code
of the state of Arizona...

64
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:41,409
...you're under arrest for assault
with intent to cause bodily injury.

65
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,052
If it were any other day,
we could get you arraigned and out of here.

66
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:44,257
Well, next time I decide to assault somebody,
I'll make sure it's not on a Sunday.

67
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:50,124
Look,
I'll stall as long as I can, but...

68
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:54,025
sooner or later, they're gonna want to take you downstairs
and put you in a holding cell for the night.

69
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:55,452
Have you heard from my husband?

70
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:59,406
Yeah. The officer who dropped your daughter off
said he was trying to get someone to watch the girls.

71
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,478
He should be coming
through the door any minute.

72
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,318
Hey, I need your help.

73
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:07,723
I need you to listen
to this young woman.

74
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:10,515
I need you to do what she says,
go to bed when she tells you to.

75
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:11,342
But...

76
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:14,002
And most of all, I need you
to not fight with your sister.

77
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:14,703
But...

78
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:16,898
Ah-ah.

79
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:18,234
Okay?

80
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:19,749
Now listen.

81
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:22,683
If I'm still not here
by the time you wake up,

82
00:05:22,784 --> 00:05:25,811
then I need you to do
whatever Kim tells you to.

83
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:32,057
Go to school and know that by the time you come home,
Mommy or me or both of us will be here.

84
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:33,311
Okay?

85
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:37,102
But I don't want Mommy
to be in jail.

86
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:38,932
Mrs. Dubois is in jail?

87
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:40,641
What did she do?

88
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,993
Nothing. It's just,
it's all a misunderstanding.

89
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:48,043
Ah... okay, so you got
my cell phone number.

90
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:49,942
With any luck, I'll be home
in a couple hours.

91
00:05:58,182 --> 00:05:59,072
Morning, Mommy.

92
00:05:59,173 --> 00:06:00,295
Morning, Daddy.

93
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,879
What's all this?

94
00:06:02,985 --> 00:06:04,138
I made coffee.

95
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:07,720
Two percent and sugar for you...
and black for you.

96
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:10,632
I find this
very frightening.

97
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:12,512
E njoy!

98
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,526
Would you look at that.

99
00:06:19,706 --> 00:06:21,880
The troops are
feeding themselves.

100
00:06:22,436 --> 00:06:25,478
I made our lunches, too,
and checked Bridgette's homework for her.

101
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:27,656
Mm! Wow! Thank you.

102
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:30,382
Do you want a waffle?

103
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:32,460
Okay, what's going on?

104
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:35,554
It's not my birthday,
it's not Father's Day...

105
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:37,231
She's buttering you up.

106
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:38,366
Am not.

107
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:40,318
That's okay, I like butter.

108
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:43,902
Butter away. Unless you're looking for
another advance on your allowance.

109
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:44,861
It's not that.

110
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:49,524
Can I go to the movies this Saturday
with some friends from school?

111
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,081
Uh, depends.

112
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:52,626
Depends on what?

113
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,659
On  the movie; the friends.

114
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:58,280
Well, I don't know
what movie yet.

115
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:00,384
Do you know
what friends yet?

116
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,446
Her boyfriend, Todd Gromada.

117
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:05,085
He's not my boyfriend.

118
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,382
But he did ask me to go
with him and his friends.

119
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:10,006
Girls, too.

120
00:07:10,444 --> 00:07:13,869
Honey... we talked about this.

121
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,275
If there are no parents there,
then your mom and I need to know who the kids are.

122
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:20,083
I'm trying to tell you who they are.

123
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:25,669
And that means that one or both of us
need to actually have met them.

124
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:28,565
Which means actually laid eyes on them,

125
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,519
talked to their parents,
that kind of thing.

126
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,275
But he's really nice, Dad.

127
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:33,580
You'll like him.

128
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:37,099
His mom died when he was little,
and his dad's a doctor.

129
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:40,248
I'm sure he is very nice, sweetie,
but that's not the point.

130
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:41,924
Yeah, and he's 14.

131
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:46,555
Fourteen?

132
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:49,553
I guess.
He's in the eighth grade.

133
00:07:49,996 --> 00:07:50,938
Eighth grade?

134
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:52,184
No.

135
00:07:52,853 --> 00:07:56,330
No way are you going to the movies
with a 14-year-old and a bunch of his friends.

136
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:57,856
But, Dad, he asked me.

137
00:07:58,013 --> 00:07:59,804
No. Uh-uh.
It's not gonna happen.

138
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:00,887
But, Dad...

139
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,761
I expect you to back me up on this.

140
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:06,856
14? Absolutely. God!

141
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:09,757
She's gonna come to you next,
so we need to be on the same page.

142
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:13,027
How old were you when your parents
started letting you do stuff like...

143
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:14,628
meet boys at the mall?

144
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:17,493
I don't know.
About Ariel's age.

145
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:19,977
Wrong answer.

146
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:21,136
Oh, my gosh.

147
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,117
If Todd Gromada had asked me to go
to the movies and my parents said no,

148
00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:26,435
- ... I don't know what I would do.
I know.

149
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,803
Have you told Todd you can't go yet?

150
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:30,101
No. It's so embarrassing.

151
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:31,982
He's never gonna talk to me again.

152
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,356
Um, excuse me, sir.

153
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:13,337
Is this where the history books are?

154
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,359
Some of them.

155
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,643
What time period would you be interested in?

156
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:20,467
I'm doing a report
on women in the pioneer days.

157
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:23,464
Women in the pioneer days!

158
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:29,665
Well... lucky for you, that is
a particular interest of mine.

159
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:35,581
She'll be arraigned first thing tomorrow.

160
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:37,716
Soon as you post bail,
you can take her home.

161
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:39,126
Okay, that's a relief.

162
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,713
Is there any way that
I can see her tonight?

163
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,032
Absolutely.
She's right in here.

164
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,086
How are the girls?

165
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:46,918
They miss you.

166
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,192
They want you home.

167
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:49,286
Even Ariel?

168
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:50,125
Of course.

169
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:53,692
I still can't understand
why she took off like that.

170
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,471
I've never been so scared.

171
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:57,815
I was sure something horrible
had happened to her.

172
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:58,965
I know, I know, I know.

173
00:09:59,146 --> 00:09:59,885
It's  okay.

174
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,957
You just overreacted, that's all.

175
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:05,505
Sorry to interrupt.

176
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:08,068
It's time to go downstairs.

177
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:11,714
What... Hold on a second.
Just wait a second.

178
00:10:11,815 --> 00:10:13,436
I mean, there's got to be
some way around this.

179
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:15,339
I mean, you know her.

180
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,589
After all that she's done
for you people.

181
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,487
You know her.

182
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:18,755
I wish there were.

183
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:20,890
Maybe in the morning.

184
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:21,784
In the morning?

185
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:23,809
Okay, look, it's fine.

186
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,497
It's gonna be 12 or 14 hours.

187
00:10:25,598 --> 00:10:26,718
I'll be fine.

188
00:10:27,832 --> 00:10:29,245
Well, I'm gonna wait right here.

189
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:30,549
That would be silly.

190
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,854
Joe, go home, be with the girls.

191
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:35,533
I love you.

192
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:41,369
I love you.

193
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,831
Hey, Ariel.

194
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:57,489
Hi, Todd.

195
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,233
So, what's up?

196
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,361
Nothing.

197
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:04,858
Shh!

198
00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:10,630
So you coming Saturday?

199
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:15,092
Um... I can't.

200
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:16,476
How come?

201
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:17,644
I- I just can't.

202
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:20,614
On Sunday...

203
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,363
...my dad said I could have
some people over to swim and stuff.

204
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:26,448
Maybe you could drop by, or whatever.

205
00:11:26,864 --> 00:11:28,486
Maybe, yeah.

206
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,305
Look, if you don't want to come...

207
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:32,751
I do, I...

208
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:35,021
I just...

209
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:36,884
Have to ask your mommy.

210
00:11:36,985 --> 00:11:38,139
Shut up, dude.

211
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:39,837
Look at her, she's like 12.

212
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:47,824
Come on, Todd, let's go.

213
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:54,079
See you around.

214
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:05,704
Oh my God...

215
00:12:06,905 --> 00:12:08,705
How tragic.

216
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:10,206
Sorry, I know it's none of my business,
but I couldn't help overhearing.

217
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:07,805
Tell your parents whatever they need to hear;
find a way to get there yourself.

218
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,411
He's sweet on you, you know.

219
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:19,621
He is- a fellow can tell.

220
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:21,840
It doesn't matter.

221
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,036
I can't see him outside of school.

222
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,549
My parents won't let me go anywhere,

223
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,250
do anything.

224
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:30,020
Yeah, parents are funny like that.

225
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:31,870
Especially nowadays.

226
00:12:31,971 --> 00:12:33,792
It's like they don't want
their children to grow up.

227
00:12:34,302 --> 00:12:35,784
Didn't  used to be like that.

228
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:38,153
Like in the pioneer days...

229
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,637
...a girl your age would be
practically old enough to get married.

230
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:47,107
You know that Juliet was only 13.

231
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:49,295
Really? 13?

232
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:59,082
The word "teenager" didn't even exist
until 50 or 60 years ago.

233
00:12:59,204 --> 00:13:03,794
It was only invented to help parents prolong
childhood for as long as possible.

234
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:06,613
My point is...

235
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:11,914
you know that you're mature and responsible,
even if your parents haven't caught on yet.

236
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,251
They don't need to know
all your business.

237
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:21,757
There's no harm keeping things from them
that they'd rather not hear, like, say...

238
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:24,889
where you're really going when
there's a boy you want to see.

239
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:27,169
But I can't lie.

240
00:13:27,528 --> 00:13:30,087
So do you want to go to
this boy's on Sunday or what?

241
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,443
It's a little cold in here, Doctor.

242
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:46,023
Come on now.

243
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:47,429
Have you seen her?

244
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,601
Have you looked at her?

245
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,591
This is the greatest moment of your life.

246
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,097
Is this going to hurt, Doctor?

247
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:05,671
She wants some doctoring, my friend.

248
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,482
She needs some doctoring.

249
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,297
Don't keep the young woman waiting,
she's cold.

250
00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:13,538
They're lovely when they're cold.

251
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:18,351
Little river of blood making its way
across her flushed skin.

252
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:22,977
Really... this is going to be
the greatest moment of your life.

253
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,669
A nice clean cut, mate.

254
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:46,830
Remember... this is
the greatest moment of your life.

255
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:02,523
Hey, honey, hold still...

256
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:04,682
But I can't see the TV.

257
00:15:05,657 --> 00:15:06,876
Who designs these things?

258
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,247
What is a Puca,

259
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:12,848
and why does it have a shell?

260
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:16,235
Okay, there we go.

261
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:16,971
All right.

262
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:19,110
Yeah, that looks nice.

263
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:22,526
Anything?

264
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:24,986
Mm... no, doesn't seem to be.

265
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,662
So maybe it was just a dream.

266
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,602
Maybe.

267
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,479
Hi, Mom.

268
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:34,002
Hi, Dad.

269
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:36,815
Am I imagining things,
or is our daughter speaking to us again?

270
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:39,223
I'm not mad anymore.
It's no big deal.

271
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:41,525
I'd rather hang out
with my friends, anyway.

272
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:42,854
Really?

273
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,275
Hannah invited Celeste and me over
to her house on Sunday afternoon.

274
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:48,893
Sounds  like fun.

275
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,465
Do you need anyone
to drop you off or anything?

276
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,949
I think Hannah's mom said that
she would pick us up- but I'll check.

277
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,094
"Table".

278
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:05,488
T- A-B... L-E.

279
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:09,111
Excellent spelling,
middle child.

280
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:17,937
Hey, look.
That's Ariel's boyfriend behind us.

281
00:16:18,423 --> 00:16:20,022
He's not my boyfriend.

282
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:24,410
His license plate
almost spells "doctor. "

283
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:27,272
I wonder if he knows
that he spelled it wrong.

284
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:29,019
It's on purpose, doofus.

285
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:30,734
Todd's dad is a doctor.

286
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:33,418
Well, then how come
he doesn't know how to spell it?

287
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,546
Forget it.

288
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:37,429
Okay, okay.

289
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,035
Good-bye, my beautiful girls.

290
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,624
Okay.

291
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:42,543
Bye!

292
00:16:42,644 --> 00:16:43,736
Bye, kittens.

293
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:44,815
Bye bye.

294
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:47,934
You want to be careful not to put
anything other than paper down the toilet.

295
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:51,746
They back up all the time, and there'll be nobody here
to fix it until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

296
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:58,689
He was just sitting
right there in the car.

297
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:00,629
Well, now you're contradicting yourself.

298
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,356
I'm not contradicting myself.

299
00:18:02,526 --> 00:18:05,298
He was right there,
then he was gone.

300
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:07,339
But he was definitely there.

301
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,674
Okay. Fine, he was there.

302
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:09,754
So what do you want to do?

303
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,734
Well, jeepers, Pa,
what do you want to do?

304
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,902
Hey, I'm just trying to be practical.

305
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:15,509
It seems to me we've already done it.

306
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,442
We've forbidden Ariel
from seeing this boy,

307
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:19,943
so presumably she's not going to have
any contact with his father, right?

308
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:25,889
And if your thesis here is that this guy's Walker's next cipher,
that this guy's somehow in the market for some young girl to cut up...

309
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,757
then the key is to make sure
Ariel has no contact with him.

310
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:31,661
What about all the other girls
he does have contact with?

311
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:36,044
Do we just sit around and let this guy
set a trap for someone else's daughter?

312
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:37,033
Huh?

313
00:18:37,134 --> 00:18:38,648
And what about Dr. Gromada?

314
00:18:38,749 --> 00:18:42,177
Are we just going to let him
be tortured, day in and day out,

315
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:44,812
hearing some voice in his head
urging him to kill?

316
00:18:44,913 --> 00:18:46,943
What am I supposed to do, Joe?

317
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,434
Just sit around
and wait for it to happen?

318
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:50,522
Allison...

319
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:53,588
I don't understand how
can you dismiss this so easily.

320
00:18:53,953 --> 00:18:55,437
Hey, I'm not dismissing anything.

321
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:57,903
But don't you find it
monumentally coincidental

322
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,104
that of all the doctors in the world,
the one that Walker chooses

323
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:03,505
happens to be the father of a boy
our daughter has a crush on?

324
00:19:03,782 --> 00:19:06,873
'Cause I do- I find that
monumentally coincidental.

325
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:09,527
So I'm asking you to consider
the slim possibility-

326
00:19:09,654 --> 00:19:11,096
before  we turn our neighbors in to the police

327
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:14,097
based on theories that are difficult,
if not impossible to prove;

328
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,763
before we embarrass our daughter
in front of her friends,

329
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:20,470
before we label respected members
of the community as future child murderers-

330
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:24,124
that perhaps you've taken a dream you had
about a case from a year ago

331
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:25,425
and mixed it up with the anxiety you're having

332
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:31,426
about your oldest daughter wanting to begin dating boys,
and projected that onto the boy's father.

333
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,072
Hi, Todd.

334
00:19:36,652 --> 00:19:37,724
Hey, Ariel.

335
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:40,888
So are you still having people over on Sunday?

336
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:44,158
'Cause... maybe if you were, I'd come.

337
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,378
Yeah, it's still on; come.

338
00:19:46,563 --> 00:19:47,525
Cool.

339
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:50,471
So, where do you live?

340
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:51,923
Out by Lakewood.

341
00:19:52,062 --> 00:19:54,343
It's the big pinkish house on Hyacinth.

342
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:56,945
Yeah, okay. I'll find it.

343
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:58,412
Cool.

344
00:19:59,126 --> 00:20:00,189
See you there, okay?

345
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:01,038
See you.

346
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:06,203
Did he say Lakewood?

347
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:08,669
That's, like, all the way across town
from where you live.

348
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:10,228
How are you even
going to get there?

349
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:11,383
I don't know.

350
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:14,024
I haven't figured that out yet.

351
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:07,498
You having a problem?

352
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:11,903
Uh... no, my car just conked out
while I was waiting.

353
00:21:12,996 --> 00:21:15,966
Well, I can take a look,
if you want.

354
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,541
Not that I'm an expert or anything.

355
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:19,756
Oh, that would be great.

356
00:21:20,524 --> 00:21:21,962
I can use any help I can get.

357
00:21:22,584 --> 00:21:24,722
I'm Allison; I'm Ariel Dubois' mom.

358
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:26,309
Jim- I'm Todd Gromada's dad.

359
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:28,563
Well, I appreciate it, Jim.

360
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:34,573
It's funny, this little voice in my head this morning
told me I should take this car in to get serviced.

361
00:21:34,864 --> 00:21:35,878
Oh, yeah?

362
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:41,345
You know that little voice
in your head sometimes people talk about?

363
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:46,929
Your battery contacts are pretty dirty,
but that shouldn't cause it to just stop.

364
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,656
You don't think I'm crazy, do you,
talking about a little voice?

365
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,333
Excuse me?

366
00:21:53,768 --> 00:21:56,337
You just said something;
I wasn't really listening.

367
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:57,901
That's okay.

368
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:01,322
Sometimes it's hard to hear what people say
when you have a voice in your head

369
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:03,223
trying to talk to you, too.

370
00:22:04,498 --> 00:22:07,795
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about.

371
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,797
Nothing. I'm just... rambling.

372
00:22:22,305 --> 00:22:23,732
Excuse me, do you know Ariel?

373
00:22:25,308 --> 00:22:27,781
Do-Do any of you know
Ariel- Ariel Dubois?

374
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:28,497
Is she here?

375
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,684
I don't know. Out back
by the pool or something.

376
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:37,564
Ariel?

377
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:51,327
Ariel!

378
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:00,022
Mrs. Dubois?

379
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:02,817
Mrs. Dubois?

380
00:23:04,115 --> 00:23:05,089
Here's your problem.

381
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,435
Your coil cable was loose.

382
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:11,656
Voilà!

383
00:23:12,187 --> 00:23:12,909
Hey, Mom.

384
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:15,910
Hi, Mom.

385
00:23:16,914 --> 00:23:18,332
Um, can I put this in the car?

386
00:23:18,485 --> 00:23:20,988
I'm walking home with Hannah,
and I don't want to have to carry it.

387
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:21,846
Are you Ariel?

388
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:23,856
I'm Dr. Gromada, Todd's dad.

389
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:25,603
Get in the car.

390
00:23:26,342 --> 00:23:27,725
Mom, this is my friend Todd's dad.

391
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:28,610
Is everything all right?

392
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:30,017
Get in the car.

393
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,553
Mom, I'm walking home.

394
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:32,796
Not today.

395
00:23:34,537 --> 00:23:37,459
Thank you for your help.
I think I have everything under control now.

396
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,420
Are you sure?

397
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,791
I- I feel like...

398
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,658
Have I done something to upset you?

399
00:23:44,245 --> 00:23:45,039
Hey, Air.

400
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,281
Hey, Dad.

401
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:50,485
What's going on?

402
00:23:52,186 --> 00:23:53,189
I have no idea.

403
00:24:17,263 --> 00:24:19,438
Sounds like she made
quite a scene, your mum.

404
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:21,192
I hate her.

405
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:23,786
And my dad's pretty mad at her, too.

406
00:24:24,452 --> 00:24:25,847
Have you seen Todd
since it happened?

407
00:24:26,142 --> 00:24:29,779
Once, in the hallway,
but he pretended not to see me.

408
00:24:30,778 --> 00:24:32,901
Well, you can explain when
you see him on Sunday.

409
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:34,748
I'm not going to see him on Sunday.

410
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,842
I can't go,
not after what happened.

411
00:24:36,989 --> 00:24:37,992
You have to go.

412
00:24:38,154 --> 00:24:39,770
Especially after what happened.

413
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:42,590
I thought you liked him.

414
00:24:43,914 --> 00:24:45,047
I know he likes you.

415
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,080
Listen to me.

416
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,506
You can't leave it like this.
You'll never forgive yourself.

417
00:24:58,641 --> 00:24:59,554
You don't understand.

418
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,772
Even if I wanted to go,
I have no way of getting there.

419
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,205
Ride your bike.

420
00:25:04,652 --> 00:25:05,514
Too far.

421
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:06,935
What about the bus?

422
00:25:07,036 --> 00:25:08,142
By myself?

423
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:11,261
Do you have any girlfriends
that live close to Todd?

424
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:12,376
I don't know.

425
00:25:13,373 --> 00:25:14,795
Maybe Celeste.

426
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:16,792
But what good does that do?

427
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:30,135
What's up? Where are you going?

428
00:25:30,373 --> 00:25:32,790
Don't get up.
It's Sunday. It's fine.

429
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:36,660
Um, Ariel wants me
to run her over to Celeste's.

430
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:37,720
Okay.

431
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:40,397
Well, she gonna come in
and say good-bye?

432
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:43,929
It's okay.
She's already in the car.

433
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,126
Just let it go, huh?

434
00:25:48,762 --> 00:25:49,701
She'll get over it.

435
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:51,435
Just give her some time, yeah?

436
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,038
The girls and I are going to the car wash.

437
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,539
It's going to be very exciting.

438
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:14,899
You sure you don't want to join us?

439
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,672
Nah.

440
00:26:16,262 --> 00:26:18,580
It's a tough ticket,
but I know people.

441
00:26:18,729 --> 00:26:20,003
I think I can get you in.

442
00:26:20,382 --> 00:26:21,639
Think I'll pass.

443
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:25,396
I don't think my fragile
constitution could handle it.

444
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:28,171
Oh, what time is Ariel due back?

445
00:26:28,437 --> 00:26:30,064
I told her I'd pick her up at 4:00.

446
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:34,488
All right, well, if you're in a jam,
let me know- I can pick her up.

447
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:37,617
Al, it's 2:00. I'm going to the carwash.
I should be back in 45 minutes.

448
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:40,262
- Okay.
- All right.

449
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,225
I'm coming, I'm coming.

450
00:27:11,355 --> 00:27:12,209
Hello.

451
00:27:12,646 --> 00:27:14,258
Is Ariel Dubois at home?

452
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:18,040
May I ask who's calling?

453
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:19,932
A friend.

454
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:23,543
No. I'm sorry.

455
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:25,110
She's not home right now.

456
00:27:25,231 --> 00:27:26,086
I see.

457
00:27:26,872 --> 00:27:28,111
Do you happen to know where she is?

458
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,018
No. I'm sorry, I don't.

459
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,370
Oh. I do.

460
00:27:56,773 --> 00:28:00,071
Hi. Hello? Hi. This is Allison Dubois.
I'm Ariel's mother.

461
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,092
Hi, Celeste. Listen,
I need to speak with Ariel.

462
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,569
What do you mean she's not there?

463
00:28:09,424 --> 00:28:11,778
We have, uh, diet stuff.

464
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:15,384
Juice, milk, whatever you want.

465
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:17,004
I don't know.

466
00:28:17,107 --> 00:28:18,173
Water, I guess.

467
00:28:26,908 --> 00:28:28,678
So, I didn't think you were
really gonna come.

468
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,800
Yeah, well, I'm sorry
about that thing with my mom.

469
00:28:33,122 --> 00:28:36,186
She can kind of be out there sometimes.

470
00:28:38,912 --> 00:28:41,363
I better get that, but
don't go anywhere, okay?

471
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:44,460
Okay.

472
00:28:48,297 --> 00:28:48,897
Ariel...

473
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:53,475
Oh... hi.
What-What are you doing here?

474
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:54,486
Never mind that.

475
00:28:55,378 --> 00:28:56,207
We've got a problem.

476
00:28:56,308 --> 00:28:57,341
Your mother's on her way.

477
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,641
What? My mom?

478
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:01,032
This way.

479
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:05,868
Come on!

480
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:13,883
Dad!

481
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,173
Dad!

482
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:35,747
Where's Ariel?

483
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:39,662
Where... Where is Ariel?

484
00:29:39,763 --> 00:29:41,351
Uh, out back by the pool...

485
00:29:42,995 --> 00:29:43,733
Ariel!

486
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,282
Ariel!

487
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:02,921
Ariel!

488
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:07,422
Ariel!

489
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:11,742
Mom!

490
00:30:12,286 --> 00:30:14,018
Mom, Mom,
stop it!

491
00:30:14,331 --> 00:30:16,374
Mom, stop it!

492
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:29,607
Isn't God the most
inspired architect?

493
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,765
Look at that.

494
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,608
She knows it, too.

495
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:38,793
She knows she's a work
of divine genius.

496
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:44,247
What she doesn't understand is
just how short-lived her divinity is.

497
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:48,628
14, 15, 16...

498
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:52,529
those years- they're like
the first days of spring.

499
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,031
Look at her.

500
00:30:58,349 --> 00:31:00,508
She's in her early May, I'd say.

501
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:08,644
That's the ticket.

502
00:31:09,543 --> 00:31:11,994
Now invite her to join you in the back.

503
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:14,690
Perhaps she wants
to play doctor.

504
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,091
Attention shoppers,
it's ten minutes to 11:00,

505
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:20,692
and that means the Sunfair Market
will be closing in ten minutes.

506
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:24,265
Comes the dawn.

507
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,724
Finally figured it out, eh?

508
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,328
Yeah.

509
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:40,276
Yes.

510
00:31:42,996 --> 00:31:44,287
It's the butcher.

511
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:46,596
Let you in on a secret.

512
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:51,662
I'm not at all sure how I feel
about this 21st century.

513
00:31:52,748 --> 00:31:54,682
The girls I want to ravage,

514
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:57,940
seems they only want to go
to female physicians.

515
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:02,400
No matter how long or loud I
whisper to a female physician-

516
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,500
well, suffice it to say

517
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,900
listening is not something
they seem much interested in.

518
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:11,851
Maybe it's what you're whispering.

519
00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:13,552
Maybe.

520
00:32:13,921 --> 00:32:15,658
No accounting for taste.

521
00:32:16,608 --> 00:32:22,536
Nonetheless... clearly,
it's incumbent upon me to adapt or die.

522
00:32:24,596 --> 00:32:26,868
Well, not die.

523
00:32:28,462 --> 00:32:33,101
Anyway, I've been whispering
in my butcher friend's ear for months.

524
00:32:34,171 --> 00:32:35,586
When I first found him,

525
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,187
I thought I could talk him into
going to medical school,

526
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:41,988
but he really doesn't have the book smarts
to become a physician.

527
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:46,916
Just sensitive and suggestible
in the ways that matter most.

528
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:49,902
And he's good with his hands.

529
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:53,883
Skilled with a blade.

530
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,767
The truly important things.

531
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,973
It was never gonna be
Todd's father, was it?

532
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,221
I sensed you were onto me-

533
00:33:04,122 --> 00:33:09,022
you and your dreams of butchers
and fresh, frozen females.

534
00:33:10,051 --> 00:33:12,167
Had to do something
to throw you off the scent.

535
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:15,511
And what a brilliant stroke of luck.

536
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:22,502
Your little girl's sweetheart
has a father who is a doctor.

537
00:33:23,206 --> 00:33:24,652
I hate you!

538
00:33:25,824 --> 00:33:27,031
I appreciate that.

539
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:31,009
It's a little after 9:00.

540
00:33:31,189 --> 00:33:32,370
I really should be running.

541
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,687
And you should wake up now.

542
00:33:44,385 --> 00:33:45,386
Guard!

543
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,588
Someone!

544
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,399
I need to call
Detective Lee Scanlon!

545
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,567
Please!

546
00:33:54,726 --> 00:33:55,940
There's my dad.

547
00:33:56,229 --> 00:33:58,456
Thanks a lot for coming
at the last minute like that.

548
00:33:58,557 --> 00:34:01,410
And you tell your dad that
I appreciate him picking you up.

549
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:02,409
All right?

550
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,086
I hope everything works out.

551
00:34:04,298 --> 00:34:05,568
Me, too.

552
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,449
What are you doing up?

553
00:34:21,797 --> 00:34:23,582
Daddy, I'm so sorry.

554
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:30,564
I didn't mean to make trouble,
but I didn't think anything bad was gonna happen.

555
00:34:30,846 --> 00:34:32,082
I know, sweetheart.

556
00:34:32,642 --> 00:34:35,051
But sneaking off without telling us,

557
00:34:35,252 --> 00:34:37,552
tricking Mommy and Daddy like that...

558
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:39,994
It wasn't my idea, you know.

559
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,718
It doesn't matter. What difference
does it make which of your friends thought it?

560
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:44,918
The point is...

561
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:47,078
It wasn't one of my friends.

562
00:34:47,406 --> 00:34:49,276
It was the new librarian.

563
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,919
Wait a second. What?

564
00:34:52,444 --> 00:34:55,129
At school, the new librarian.

565
00:34:58,103 --> 00:35:05,449
Ariel, an adult, a member of the school faculty
told you to lie and sneak off to a party?

566
00:35:07,593 --> 00:35:10,205
Does this librarian have a name?

567
00:35:10,633 --> 00:35:13,338
I don't know, actually.
He didn't say.

568
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:15,166
But he had an English accent.

569
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:17,216
English accent?

570
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:18,637
Okay.

571
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,381
And... and you know what was weird?

572
00:35:21,614 --> 00:35:23,486
He was at the party, too.

573
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,712
He was at the party?

574
00:35:27,602 --> 00:35:31,391
And he told me to hide,
'cause Mom was looking for me.

575
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:33,833
Ariel, wait a second.

576
00:35:34,106 --> 00:35:36,511
How does this guy even know
what Mommy looks like?

577
00:35:37,046 --> 00:35:37,936
I don't know.

578
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:42,539
But he's the reason
that I walked into the door.

579
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,589
I was following him,
and it was so weird.

580
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,815
He must've closed it behind him.

581
00:35:49,251 --> 00:35:53,545
But he couldn't have,
because I was right behind him.

582
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:55,197
Ariel, hold on.

583
00:35:56,408 --> 00:35:57,420
I don't understand, sweetie.

584
00:35:57,521 --> 00:35:58,894
Explain that to me again.

585
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:03,110
It was like he walked
through the glass or something.

586
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:05,050
Like a ghost out of a movie.

587
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:10,781
Scanlon here.

588
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:12,423
Detective, hi.

589
00:36:12,524 --> 00:36:14,517
Uh... I'm glad I caught you.

590
00:36:14,618 --> 00:36:16,647
This is Joe Dubois,
Allison's husband.

591
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,147
Hi. What can I do for you?

592
00:36:18,248 --> 00:36:22,224
I know this is gonna sound kind of nutty,
but is there any way that I could talk to my wife?

593
00:36:23,108 --> 00:36:25,211
I'm running out of time!

594
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:28,541
Not much of a signal down here.

595
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,077
It's your husband.

596
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:35,679
You know, you have
one very excitable family.

597
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:40,984
It's a little cold in here, Doctor.

598
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:51,582
I got to tell you, this is about the strangest place
I've ever done anything like this.

599
00:36:55,383 --> 00:36:57,603
You sure you don't
want to go to a bar first?

600
00:36:59,513 --> 00:37:02,643
A little alcohol wouldn't hurt anything,
if you know what I mean.

601
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:08,906
I mean, I don't need a white
tile room to play doctor.

602
00:37:09,176 --> 00:37:10,936
I can do just fine in the dark.

603
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,700
Come on now.

604
00:37:13,134 --> 00:37:14,015
Have you seen her?

605
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:15,793
Have you looked at her?

606
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:17,901
This is the greatest moment of your life.

607
00:37:19,817 --> 00:37:21,208
Is this gonna hurt, Doctor?

608
00:37:31,424 --> 00:37:32,967
She wants some doctoring,
my friend.

609
00:37:33,556 --> 00:37:36,074
She needs some doctoring.

610
00:37:36,357 --> 00:37:37,847
Don't keep the young woman waiting.

611
00:37:37,948 --> 00:37:40,585
She's cold.
They're lovely when they're cold.

612
00:37:41,574 --> 00:37:45,693
Little river of blood, making its way
across their flushed skin.

613
00:37:47,185 --> 00:37:50,126
Really, this is going to be the
greatest moment of your life.

614
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,793
A nice clean cut, mate.

615
00:38:09,604 --> 00:38:14,452
Remember, this is the
greatest moment of your life.

616
00:38:17,637 --> 00:38:19,205
Phoenix Police!
Drop the knife!

617
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,951
Sir, you get any closer to the girl
with that knife, and I will fire.

618
00:38:22,101 --> 00:38:25,090
And trust me, my bullet will travel
a lot faster than your arm.

619
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,024
Do it!

620
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:27,412
Sir, lower the knife.

621
00:38:29,364 --> 00:38:30,841
Tear her! Do it!

622
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,142
Lower the knife.

623
00:38:33,304 --> 00:38:33,904
Don't listen to him!

624
00:38:33,867 --> 00:38:36,024
Sir, I'm gonna count to three.

625
00:38:36,385 --> 00:38:37,590
If you don't drop the weapon...

626
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:38,712
Put it in her!

627
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:41,876
One, two...

628
00:38:42,003 --> 00:38:43,024
Pierce her, damn it!

629
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,619
Rip her apart!

630
00:38:51,781 --> 00:38:53,048
Go ahead, put on your clothes.

631
00:38:55,521 --> 00:38:57,627
I need an ambulance at Sunfair Market.

632
00:38:57,896 --> 00:38:59,134
Are you happy?

633
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:00,328
You ruined it.

634
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:01,899
Sir, you're under arrest.

635
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,198
You ruined everything.

636
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:03,899
Turn around.

637
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,478
Wonderful.

638
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:07,491
- A butcher with a bad arm.
- You have the right to remain silent.

639
00:39:07,886 --> 00:39:10,321
- A hysterical, fully dressed girl.
- Anything you say, can and will...

640
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:11,654
You have the right to counsel.

641
00:39:11,755 --> 00:39:13,620
Stop crying!
Nothing happened!

642
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:16,162
If you are unable to obtain counsel,
counsel will be appointed for you.

643
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:17,827
If you choose to answer questions
without an attorney present...

644
00:39:17,928 --> 00:39:19,133
You people. Pathetic.

645
00:39:22,421 --> 00:39:23,668
Mrs. Allison Dubois?

646
00:39:32,407 --> 00:39:33,680
Here, Your Honor.

647
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:35,847
Do you understand the charges
against you, Mrs. Dubois?

648
00:39:35,948 --> 00:39:37,049
I do, Your Honor.

649
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:39,137
State have a bail recommendation?

650
00:39:39,498 --> 00:39:41,207
Begging the court's indulgence,
Your Honor.

651
00:39:41,308 --> 00:39:43,218
But I just came from
a conference with the complainant.

652
00:39:51,752 --> 00:39:53,551
Your Honor, I'm happy to report
that once Dr. Gromada

653
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:57,752
was made aware that this was nothing more
than a case of mistaken identity on Mrs. Dubois' part,

654
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:01,258
made in her capacity
as an employee of my office,

655
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,339
and that a young woman's life was saved
as a result of her efforts,

656
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,782
the good doctor has agreed
to drop all charges.

657
00:40:06,883 --> 00:40:07,596
Very well.

658
00:40:07,735 --> 00:40:11,274
If that's the situation,
I'm not one to make more work for this court.

659
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,723
Case dismissed.

660
00:40:14,987 --> 00:40:16,340
You're free to go,
Mrs. Dubois.

661
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:18,394
Thank you.

662
00:40:23,946 --> 00:40:25,300
- No TV for a month.
- Okay.

663
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:27,414
- No phone privileges.
- All right.

664
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:31,135
- And no time on the computer unless it's specifically homework related.
- But...

665
00:40:31,236 --> 00:40:32,100
Okay.

666
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:34,707
I'm sorry, Mom.

667
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:35,966
I know you are.

668
00:40:38,865 --> 00:40:41,502
Is anything gonna happen
to the man in the library?

669
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,095
He isn't there anymore.

670
00:40:43,397 --> 00:40:46,507
And if you ever see him again,
if he ever tries to talk to you,

671
00:40:46,608 --> 00:40:49,808
you ignore him and you tell me
right away, okay?

672
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:50,827
Okay.

673
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:58,252
And, Ariel, I want you to know
that I am going to call Todd's dad tomorrow,

674
00:40:58,353 --> 00:41:00,605
and I'm gonna personally apologize.

675
00:41:01,885 --> 00:41:07,906
It's okay; he was talking
to this seventh-grade girl today- Julie.

676
00:41:09,982 --> 00:41:11,199
Oh, wow.

677
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:15,442
It sounds like I roughed up
the wrong Gromada in that house.

678
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,809
I love you, Mom.

679
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:24,114
I love you, Ariel.

680
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:32,661
Now let's get some sleep.

681
00:41:33,003 --> 00:41:33,784
Okay.

682
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:53,485
