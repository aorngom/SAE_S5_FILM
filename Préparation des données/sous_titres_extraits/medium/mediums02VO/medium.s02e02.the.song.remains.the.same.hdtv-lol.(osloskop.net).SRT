1
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:09,030
...how you did me wrong

2
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:09,929
But I grew strong

3
00:00:10,403 --> 00:00:12,340
And I learned how to get along

4
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:15,618
And so you're back from outer space

5
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:18,345
I just walked in to find you here

6
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:20,252
With that sad look upon your face

7
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:22,487
I should have changed that stupid lock

8
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:24,630
I should have made you leave your key

9
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:26,820
If I'd have known for just one second

10
00:00:26,871 --> 00:00:28,559
You'd be back to bother me

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,310
Go on, now, go, walk out the door

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,650
Just turn around now

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,220
because you're not welcome anymore

14
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:41,236
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with good-bye?

15
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:42,780
Did you think I'd crumble?

16
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:45,208
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

17
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:46,567
Oh, no, not I

18
00:00:47,243 --> 00:00:48,675
I will survive

19
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:51,798
Oh, as long as I know how to love

20
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:53,461
I know I'll stay alive

21
00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:55,463
I've got all my life to live

22
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,428
I've got all my love to give

23
00:00:57,652 --> 00:00:59,123
And I'll survive

24
00:00:59,577 --> 00:01:02,713
I will survive, hey, hey

25
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,180
And I learned how to get along

26
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:21,416
And so you're back from outer space

27
00:01:22,235 --> 00:01:24,024
I just walked in to find you here

28
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:26,152
With that sad look upon your face

29
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:28,281
I should have changed that stupid lock...

30
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:30,207
What... What's the deal?

31
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:32,420
If I'd have known for just one second...

32
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:34,063
Why didn't you wake me?

33
00:01:34,612 --> 00:01:35,905
Go on, now, go

34
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:36,837
Guys?

35
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,174
Walk out the door...

36
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:41,239
It's ten after 7:00!
It's a school day.

37
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,767
'Cause you're not welcome anymore

38
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:44,139
Is that us?

39
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,395
Weren't you the one who tried...

40
00:01:45,446 --> 00:01:47,074
Is that coming from here?

41
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,962
Do you believe this?

42
00:01:49,013 --> 00:01:49,630
Huh?

43
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:58,380
Why didn't you wake me?

44
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,951
What?

45
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:04,255
Is that the neighbors?

46
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:06,815
I will survive...

47
00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:08,113
Do you not hear that?

48
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:10,938
That song!

49
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,370
I should have changed that stupid lock...

50
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:17,182
No! I told you,
I'm not all right!

51
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:18,618
I've got a song in my head!

52
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,579
It's really hard to hear.

53
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:29,321
No, it's not an expression.

54
00:03:29,372 --> 00:03:33,500
I have a real song in my head,
and it's loud, and it's hard to hear.

55
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:35,465
What time is it?

56
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:38,547
I got to get the girls to school.

57
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:49,299
Okay, if you could take the girls to school,

58
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,990
I will drive over to the university,

59
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,141
and see if I can find that Dr. Cardwell.

60
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:55,638
You know the one who helped me with that train dream.

61
00:03:57,565 --> 00:03:58,752
It's a song.

62
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,318
It-It's not like I can't see.

63
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:03,168
Just take the girls.

64
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:49,209
I'm sorry.
I'm not from around here.

65
00:05:00,774 --> 00:05:02,094
Weren't you the one who tried

66
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:03,735
to break me with good-bye?

67
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:05,027
Did you think I'd crumble?

68
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:07,595
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

69
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,946
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,

70
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:12,052
no, no, no...

71
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,999
Go on, now, go...

72
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:18,083
Go on, now, go...

73
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,270
Go on, now, go...

74
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:20,413
Go on, now, go...

75
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:22,838
No, no, no, no, no,

76
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,737
no, no, no, no...

77
00:05:25,554 --> 00:05:26,671
Go on, now, go...

78
00:05:26,722 --> 00:05:27,691
Go on, now, go...

79
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:28,810
Go on, now, go...

80
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:30,046
Go on, now go...

81
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:38,782
No, no, no, no,

82
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:43,002
no, no, no, no, no...

83
00:05:43,752 --> 00:05:44,696
Go on, now, go...

84
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:46,013
Go on, now, go...

85
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:47,197
Go on, now, go...

86
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:49,515
Go on, now, go...

87
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:56,052
No, no, no, no, no,

88
00:05:56,103 --> 00:05:58,004
no, no, no, no, no...

89
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,519
Go on, now, go...

90
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,253
Go on, now, go...

91
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,673
No, no, no, no, no,

92
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:04,987
no, no, no, no...

93
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:05,926
Go on, now, go...

94
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:08,013
Go on, now, go...

95
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:11,416
Go, go, go, go, go,

96
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:15,884
go, go, go, go, go...

97
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:37,880
Oh, my God.

98
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:41,807
How do you spell it again?

99
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:43,950
Wedding: W-E-D-D-I-N-G.

100
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:44,987
S lower!

101
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:47,207
Bridgette, I'm doing something.

102
00:06:47,258 --> 00:06:48,149
Mom.

103
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:49,893
Bridge, okay...

104
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,331
Let's sound it out.

105
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:52,977
Wedding. Wed...

106
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:54,853
What does that start with?

107
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:56,949
I don't know.
Can't you just spell it?

108
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,112
Joe, could you get that?

109
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:02,972
I think it's the District Attorney's, and I'm all greasy.

110
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,745
Great  job. We're going to drive all the way

111
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:09,561
to Salt Lake City, so you can wish Aunt Amanda happy weeding.

112
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:11,077
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah, she's right here.

113
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:14,230
District Attorney Devalos requesting a word.

114
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:16,571
- Hello?
- No, I didn't. I spelled it right.

115
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:19,049
- Bridgette, you spelled it wrong.
- Can you hold on a second?

116
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,911
Back off!

117
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:21,919
- You spelled it wrong.
- Nuh-uh.

118
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,435
- All right, girls, keep it down, huh?
- Bridgette, come on, you spelled it wrong. Look.

119
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,466
Shut up.

120
00:07:26,517 --> 00:07:27,485
I'm back.

121
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:31,272
Everything all right there?

122
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:34,493
Ah, you talking about that blissful silence?

123
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:36,242
- Girls, hey!|- Isn't it wonderful?

124
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:37,951
Well, if you say so.

125
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:39,571
I'm just calling to give you an update.

126
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,686
Forensics is still examining the music player you brought in.

127
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:45,608
The blood does appear to be Isabel Navarro's.

128
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:48,794
We canvassed her dorm, talked to about 30 students.

129
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,570
Turns out she's only been missing since yesterday.

130
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:55,961
Very religious girl. She went to mass Sunday morning, had lunch with two friends,

131
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:57,459
then she went for a run.

132
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,720
No one has seen her since.

133
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:01,716
So, really she's been missing less than 24 hours.

134
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:02,974
Exactly.

135
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:05,412
She probably wouldn't even be on our radar yet

136
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,321
if you hadn't stumbled across that iPod.

137
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:10,836
Hmm. Well, we're gonna find her before Friday.

138
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:15,587
Well, that's great, but, uh, how can you be so sure?

139
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:20,282
Because Friday morning I am going to Salt Lake City with Joe and the girls.

140
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,147
Leave on some family trip somewhere, right?

141
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:23,633
It's very exciting.

142
00:08:23,948 --> 00:08:26,839
Joe's sister is getting married for the third time.

143
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:28,513
Well, practice makes perfect.

144
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,300
Hi.

145
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,690
Where's Daddy
and Bridgette?

146
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,900
Huh? Oh, she needed a time out.

147
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:39,503
What? Why?

148
00:08:39,756 --> 00:08:41,640
She doesn't respond well to criticism.

149
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:44,123
Criticism or sarcasm?

150
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:48,622
- Hey, what's that?
- What?

151
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:50,326
That banner.
Click on that.

152
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:55,434
This Website has airline tickets from Phoenix

153
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:57,920
to Salt Lake City for $99.

154
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:00,725
Joe! Joe!

155
00:09:01,455 --> 00:09:02,805
Secret confession?

156
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:07,284
The thought of being in that car with the kids for ten hours driving

157
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:09,248
to Salt Lake City... Ugh!

158
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,683
I like planes.

159
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:12,329
Planes are fast!

160
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:16,059
Nobody fights about who's going to roll down their window, or where we're gonna stop for lunch.

161
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,221
I like planes.

162
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:18,985
Somebody's giddy.

163
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:20,390
Guess what I like.

164
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,623
Hey, guess what I like.

165
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:24,219
Planes?

166
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:40,062
Come on, don't do this.

167
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:47,234
Come on, not here, not now.

168
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:31,432
You want me to cancel the tickets

169
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:35,353
I mean... I'm not sure if I can.
I don't know if they'll let me.

170
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,379
Frankly, I don't really want to.

171
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:41,930
Look, let's just, can we talk about this dream for a second?

172
00:10:41,981 --> 00:10:43,965
I mean, it's not like you were on the plane.

173
00:10:44,462 --> 00:10:46,493
If I understood you correctly, in this dream,

174
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:48,860
you were standing on the ground.

175
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:50,017
Have I got that right?

176
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,117
Yeah.

177
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:52,191
Okay, then.

178
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:55,746
You know at the end of the day, I'm gonna do what you want.

179
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,717
I'm just not sure that it makes sense to be afraid of flying

180
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:01,395
if you're standing on the ground and a plane falls on you.

181
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:04,914
I mean, you might never want to walk down a country road again...

182
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:06,056
Are you making fun of me?

183
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:08,068
Not on purpose, no.

184
00:11:10,746 --> 00:11:13,308
Most people, you'd say, sleep on it.

185
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:17,677
Can we see how you feel at the end of the day?

186
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:22,871
Copying anything important?

187
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:29,289
A Happy Weeding card.

188
00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:32,477
Supposed to be Happy Wedding.

189
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:34,499
My daughter wanted me to fix it,

190
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,978
so I thought I'd try to copy it and cut and paste...

191
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,374
It's not important.

192
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:40,986
Uh, do you need me?

193
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:45,759
Señor Navarro. Esta la señora de quien hable.

194
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,554
Allison Dubois, this is Jorge Navarro,

195
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:50,046
he's the father of the young woman,

196
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:51,872
whose music player you found yesterday.

197
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:53,636
And this is Father Santiago,

198
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:55,615
he's the priest at Isabel's parish...

199
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:57,217
- Thank you.
- No.

200
00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:58,894
There's  no reason to thank me.

201
00:11:58,945 --> 00:12:00,069
Really, I didn't do anything.

202
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,582
I-I just was going to the doctor,

203
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:03,151
and I saw something in the dirt...

204
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:04,012
My Isabel?

205
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:06,726
She's a good girl, a good student.

206
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,832
When she didn't call me Sunday night, I called the police.

207
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:13,618
I told them, "You have to look for my baby,"

208
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,460
but they said "Wait."

209
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:17,355
They wouldn't even start looking.

210
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:20,447
Not until you found her radio...

211
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:25,890
The Navarros have been a part of our parish as long as I can remember,

212
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:29,368
ever since Jorge here came to this country 14 years ago.

213
00:12:30,214 --> 00:12:32,604
We're all praying that Isabel is returned to us very soon.

214
00:12:33,457 --> 00:12:35,960
Anything you need, meeting rooms,

215
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:38,466
volunteers for search parties,

216
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:40,091
our church stands ready.

217
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,395
We appreciate that.

218
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:44,754
We hope, of course, it's not necessary, but we do appreciate it.

219
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,513
Señor... estamos haciendo todo lo que podemos

220
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:51,993
para segurar la vuelta de su hija, okay?

221
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:52,893
Gracias.

222
00:12:53,412 --> 00:12:55,550
Father, thank you for bringing Mr. Navarro.

223
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,148
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. District Attorney.

224
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:57,799
Un placer.

225
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:58,891
Thank you very much.

226
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:00,265
Weren't you the one...?

227
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:03,273
- Allison?|- Weren't you the one?

228
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,141
- Ms. Dubois, are you okay?|- Weren't you the one?

229
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:09,447
- Ms. Dubois?|- Allison?

230
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:11,231
Mrs. Dubois?

231
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,304
Yes. I'm sorry.

232
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:14,934
I don't know what happened there.

233
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,539
I just went away for a minute...

234
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,629
But I'm back. I'm fine.

235
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:22,637
You sure?

236
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:24,123
Yeah, I'm positive.

237
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:26,189
Señores?

238
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:39,273
He's involved in this.

239
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,471
Mr. Navarro? Her father?

240
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:44,311
I'm talking about the priest.

241
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:50,236
Father Santiago? I don't think so.

242
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:53,094
Allison, the man is a Catholic priest...

243
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:55,324
You don't want to hear what I have to say on that subject.

244
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,427
Not to mention the factthat he has a rock solid alibi

245
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:59,766
for the two hour period when Isabel went for her run.

246
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:00,732
How rock solid?

247
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:01,833
He was teaching Bible class

248
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:05,603
which means there's at least 15 people that can swear to his whereabouts.

249
00:14:05,654 --> 00:14:08,098
And he's a Catholic priest.

250
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:10,648
I'm sorry, but that still means something to me.

251
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:12,535
Well, I didn't mean to offend you.

252
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,778
And we happen to live in a city where it still means something

253
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:17,451
to a fairly considerable proportion of the population.

254
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,313
And, lest you forget, I'm an elected official.

255
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:23,443
So unless and until you have something that trumps the fact

256
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:26,255
that he can prove he wasn't anywhere near where you found that iPod,

257
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:28,540
I'm going to let the good father continue on his way.

258
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:32,946
I'm sure he wasn't actually angry at you.

259
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,564
I don't know, he seemed pretty upset.

260
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:37,476
Well, come on, it is a fairly outrageous assertion.

261
00:14:37,856 --> 00:14:39,364
Why? He's just a man.

262
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:42,756
He's a priest, Allison. He's a Catholic priest.

263
00:14:42,866 --> 00:14:44,823
And if he's serious about his faith, he's made some

264
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:48,071
fairly extraordinary sacrifices to serve his fellow man.

265
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,476
Well, I'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you.

266
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:53,792
There was nothing vague about the sensation I experienced when I shook his hand.

267
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:56,495
I'm sure, but does that mean that he's the one who took her?

268
00:14:56,617 --> 00:14:58,658
Couldn't there be some other explanation for that?

269
00:14:58,709 --> 00:14:59,521
Like what?

270
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:00,631
I don't know.

271
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,460
Maybe he knows something, maybe...

272
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,762
Maybe she's not the girl that we think she is.
Maybe she said something to him.

273
00:15:08,297 --> 00:15:09,670
Maybe she told him she was going to run away.

274
00:15:09,721 --> 00:15:12,861
She hated school, she hated trying to please her father.

275
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:15,365
Come on, if she ran away, he would tell her dad.

276
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:17,105
He'd let somebody know.

277
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:18,775
He'd have to talk to the police.

278
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:21,424
- He'd have to.
- I don't know, Al.

279
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:22,856
People tell priests lots of things.

280
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:24,449
They got to keep a lot of secrets.

281
00:15:24,734 --> 00:15:25,424
I don't know.

282
00:15:26,247 --> 00:15:28,326
Well, maybe somebody else told him something.

283
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,972
I mean, come on, here's a guy who, every day,

284
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:35,528
hears people pour out their worst behavior in the hopes of being cleansed.

285
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,779
That's what confession is.
It's a large part of what he does.

286
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,654
I'm just saying that there may be another reason

287
00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:42,531
you reacted as strongly to him as you did.

288
00:15:43,954 --> 00:15:46,049
I think, at the very least, you owe him a conversation.

289
00:15:47,284 --> 00:15:48,478
Mommy.

290
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,597
Baby, what are you doing up?

291
00:15:51,648 --> 00:15:53,236
I had a bad dream.

292
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:54,705
Oh, no.

293
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,551
Come here, stinkbug.

294
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:08,135
It's good talking to you.

295
00:16:32,603 --> 00:16:34,270
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned...

296
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,758
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned...

297
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:39,306
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

298
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,975
I hate my brother...

299
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:46,040
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned...

300
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:49,794
I  saw something I wasn't supposed to be...

301
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:54,683
And I don't know what to do.

302
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,600
May God, who has enlightened every heart,

303
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:29,839
help you to know your sins and trust in his mercy.

304
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:30,792
Amen.

305
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:33,944
Hello?

306
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:35,288
Hello.

307
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:37,728
Um, I'm sorry, I didn't know anyone was over there.

308
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:39,102
I'm very sorry.

309
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,662
It's okay, this is a church.
Everyone is welcome here.

310
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:43,379
Would you like to make confession?

311
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,870
Uh... to be honest... uh, I don't know.

312
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:52,372
Have you received Communion?

313
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:58,656
I... I'm not Catholic, Father.

314
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:01,003
A-ha.

315
00:18:02,154 --> 00:18:03,852
Well, that does pose a bit of a problem.

316
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,054
I can't actually offer confession to someone who hasn't, uh...

317
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:10,748
Oh... I-I-I understand.

318
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,971
I'm so sorry.

319
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:14,192
- I think I'm just going to...
- But I'm happy to listen.

320
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:17,091
Excuse me?

321
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:19,029
I can't offer you absolution,

322
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,240
but clearly there's a reason you came here.

323
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:25,604
I mean, you're not in the habit of visiting strange churches, are you?

324
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:27,594
There must be something on your mind,

325
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:29,009
something that drew you here...

326
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:34,421
I've heard everything, I promise. You can't shock me.

327
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,610
Well... the thing is...

328
00:18:52,788 --> 00:18:54,098
Someone came to me.

329
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:57,279
He did a horrible thing, he...

330
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:05,911
put a young woman I know in a dangerous position, maybe even killed her.

331
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:12,180
I know all about it, but I can't tell anyone.

332
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:14,011
Wh-What do you mean? Of course you can.

333
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:17,725
I-I don't think so.

334
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:22,718
I'm a priest.

335
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:26,268
Miss...

336
00:19:26,604 --> 00:19:27,750
Isn't that the way it works?

337
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,304
Maybe you were right. Maybe you should go.

338
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:33,077
No, no, Father Santiago!

339
00:19:33,293 --> 00:19:36,380
I'm someone who understands the horrible position that you're in.

340
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,558
I have no idea what you're talking about.

341
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,776
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

342
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:43,085
I'm talking about Isabel Navarro.

343
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,009
You know something.

344
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,552
Something that you're not telling.

345
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,896
Young lady, if you are suggesting

346
00:19:50,947 --> 00:19:54,679
that I may have heard something during confession about Isabel Navarro...

347
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,543
I'm not suggesting...

348
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,631
There's nothing I can do.

349
00:19:58,046 --> 00:19:59,433
As a fellow priest,

350
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,111
I'm sure you know the seal of confession can't be broken.

351
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:06,447
Not even if it could save a girl's life?

352
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:10,577
No... not even for that.

353
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,219
But that can't be the answer.

354
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,146
That can't be right.

355
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:23,836
Miss... when someone confesses to me, they're not talking to me.

356
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:25,914
They're talking through me, directly to God.

357
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:29,898
God offers them forgiveness, not me.
I can't betray that.

358
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,604
Not for any reason, even for the life of a girl.

359
00:20:35,096 --> 00:20:37,070
Well, what if you didn'thave to say anything?

360
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:39,827
What if you just had to think it?

361
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:42,642
You just had to think about him.

362
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,975
You just have to think about what he said.

363
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:47,604
What would be the point of that?

364
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:50,623
Well, the point of that might be...

365
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,577
that it's possible that I...

366
00:20:57,286 --> 00:20:59,646
that I could hear your thoughts.

367
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:04,489
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,

368
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,217
and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning...

369
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:06,885
Father?

370
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:09,153
...and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

371
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:09,942
No, Father!

372
00:21:09,993 --> 00:21:10,984
Father, please!

373
00:21:11,678 --> 00:21:13,400
I'm going to leave you my phone number.

374
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,949
Call me. Maybe we can figure out a way we can help this girl.

375
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:18,872
Please.

376
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:30,420
I - I gotta get up at five, get into work early.

377
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:34,711
I'm behind on the McCarthy thing and if we're still gonna leave on Friday...

378
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:36,150
We're still gonna leave on Friday.

379
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:38,485
By whatever conveyance.

380
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,813
We're flying, we're flying, we're flying.

381
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:43,827
Excellent.

382
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:47,047
And I promise not to make you walk down any country roads.

383
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:49,977
Oh, shoot!

384
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:53,016
Was it something I said?

385
00:21:53,326 --> 00:21:54,306
I'll be right back.

386
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,261
Honey, it's 11:20.

387
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:05,369
I know.

388
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:08,543
Do you still think he's really gonna call?

389
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:10,274
I don't know.

390
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,903
It's just, she's still out there, Joe.

391
00:22:16,728 --> 00:22:18,160
I just can't give up.

392
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:36,614
Joe!

393
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:38,778
Joe...

394
00:23:39,664 --> 00:23:41,963
I had another bad dream.

395
00:23:42,262 --> 00:23:43,344
Where's Daddy?

396
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:45,993
He had to go to work early.

397
00:23:46,413 --> 00:23:47,270
You okay?

398
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:53,054
Hi.

399
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,197
It's the chicken delivery man.

400
00:23:57,881 --> 00:23:59,020
Anybody home?

401
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:00,782
Hi.

402
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:02,584
No hi?

403
00:24:03,757 --> 00:24:04,491
Hi!

404
00:24:05,272 --> 00:24:06,638
What's the rush?

405
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:08,084
Gettin' ready!

406
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:09,805
Gettin' ready?

407
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:12,398
For what?

408
00:24:14,325 --> 00:24:16,893
Hey, someone's all nice and clean.

409
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:18,174
Do I have to go?

410
00:24:18,468 --> 00:24:20,085
Well, what are you talking about?
Go where, babe?

411
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:20,960
Church.

412
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,119
Church?

413
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:24,054
Church.
Mommy says we're going to church,

414
00:24:24,105 --> 00:24:25,296
and it's not even our church.

415
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:27,769
All of us.
And I don't want to go.

416
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,227
It's Wednesday. Can't I just go to Claire's?

417
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:32,696
Church?

418
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:37,529
Church?

419
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:38,399
What?!

420
00:24:38,588 --> 00:24:39,433
Church!

421
00:24:40,973 --> 00:24:44,234
I just heard a  vicious rumor
that the Dubois family is going to church.

422
00:24:45,214 --> 00:24:46,342
I thought it'd be nice.

423
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:49,519
They're having a prayer vigil for Isabel Navarro at 6:30.

424
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,363
We'll be back before dark. What could be the harm?

425
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:53,442
I see.

426
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:56,954
And being good Catholics and close personal friends of Isabel's,

427
00:24:57,007 --> 00:24:59,152
you thought we'd all go and offer our prayers?

428
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:01,257
Oh, that's right, we're not Catholic...

429
00:25:01,586 --> 00:25:03,247
and none of us have ever met the woman.

430
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:05,924
Could there be some other purpose in all this?

431
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:09,645
You're not hoping to coax something out of the good Father, are you?

432
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:11,754
Well, I just thought if we met face to face...

433
00:25:12,082 --> 00:25:13,274
The man took a vow.

434
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:14,651
And so did you.

435
00:25:16,613 --> 00:25:18,915
Wear the blue, please?

436
00:25:20,774 --> 00:25:23,038
I would like to thank everyone who spoke tonight,

437
00:25:24,253 --> 00:25:26,551
everyone who offered their prayers.

438
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:31,029
This is an anxious moment for all of us who know Isabel.

439
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:35,773
This is also an anxious time for anyone who believes in God,

440
00:25:35,824 --> 00:25:40,722
because we must somehow reconcile the fear that consumes us,

441
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:43,520
the anger that grips us,

442
00:25:43,587 --> 00:25:45,524
and the sadness that fills us up

443
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:48,884
with the faith we have all been taught will see us through.

444
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:52,059
And I know what you're thinking,

445
00:25:52,688 --> 00:25:54,099
Mr. Navarro.
You're thinking,

446
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,138
"It is easy for you to speak of faith.

447
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:59,777
You do not have a daughter to lose, Father."

448
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,203
And you would be right.

449
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:07,299
I will never know the love that a parent has for a child.

450
00:26:08,507 --> 00:26:12,240
In fact, the only love I know that might come close...

451
00:26:13,402 --> 00:26:14,831
is my love for God.

452
00:26:17,096 --> 00:26:20,221
My love for God is all consuming...

453
00:26:21,135 --> 00:26:23,798
and yet, I pledge to you...

454
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:29,048
and pledge to the man who took away our Isabel...

455
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:36,699
if you do not come forward, if you do not return our Isabel...

456
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:44,145
...if you do not put an end to this interminable suffering and sadness...

457
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:49,423
I cannot promise you that I will not betray my vows...

458
00:26:50,223 --> 00:26:51,047
Oh, my God.

459
00:26:51,814 --> 00:26:52,414
What, babe?

460
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:54,794
- ...give up the thing that I love most...
- He's talking to him.

461
00:26:55,037 --> 00:27:00,316
...betray my God and do all that I can to find you...

462
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:01,034
Talking to who?

463
00:27:01,297 --> 00:27:02,849
to unmask you...

464
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:05,255
to see that you suffer...

465
00:27:06,003 --> 00:27:07,782
as Isabel has suffered...

466
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:11,699
as her father has suffered...

467
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:16,152
- Al, sit down.
- ...as everyone who knows Isabel has suffered.

468
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:17,947
He's talking to him. He's here.

469
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:19,764
Who's here, Mommy?

470
00:27:20,381 --> 00:27:22,535
Mommy, sit down. Everybody's staring.

471
00:27:35,037 --> 00:27:36,503
And now, let us take a moment,

472
00:27:37,598 --> 00:27:41,930
rise... and offer each other the sign of peace.

473
00:27:45,492 --> 00:27:46,181
Gracias.

474
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:55,848
Thank you for coming.

475
00:27:56,098 --> 00:27:57,284
May God be with you.

476
00:27:57,653 --> 00:27:58,943
He was here, wasn't he?

477
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,817
He was right here, right in front of you,

478
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:03,261
right in front of us, and you let him walk out the door.

479
00:28:04,494 --> 00:28:07,180
You're the woman in the confessional.

480
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:09,701
You work for the District Attorney.

481
00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:11,746
But you leave me your phone number,

482
00:28:11,797 --> 00:28:14,241
you claim that you can read my thoughts if I let you?

483
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:17,716
Is this a new form of forensics I haven't read about?

484
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,324
As I said before, God be with you.

485
00:28:24,784 --> 00:28:26,536
Well... who will be with Isabel?

486
00:28:26,845 --> 00:28:29,661
Rest assured, God will protect Isabel.

487
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:31,680
Well, maybe God wants us to protect Isabel.

488
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,269
Maybe you and I are the way.

489
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:34,576
No, not yet.

490
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:35,965
Not today, we're not.

491
00:28:36,142 --> 00:28:37,076
I don't understand.

492
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:37,971
You said you would do it.

493
00:28:38,022 --> 00:28:39,166
You said you would tell.

494
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,215
I heard you.

495
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:41,798
You were talking to him up there,

496
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:43,172
threatening to break your vow.

497
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:46,039
Please! Help me!

498
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:48,205
Just tell me who he is.

499
00:28:48,565 --> 00:28:50,714
I can't. Not yet.

500
00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:55,564
First, we must let God do His work, to hear our prayers.

501
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:56,699
That is faith.

502
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,860
There's no time.

503
00:28:57,911 --> 00:28:59,011
There's always time.

504
00:28:59,597 --> 00:29:01,758
And then, if God lets us down, which he won't,

505
00:29:02,054 --> 00:29:03,527
then I suppose it's time for vengeance.

506
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:05,046
I don't care about vengeance.

507
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:06,672
I just want to find her.

508
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:10,212
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

509
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:16,331
Just let me into your head.

510
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:18,275
Just let me see who he is.

511
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,607
May God be with you.

512
00:29:20,685 --> 00:29:21,453
Father.

513
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:25,321
Father, when you sleep, do you dream?

514
00:29:25,758 --> 00:29:27,768
Of course I do.
Everyone dreams.

515
00:29:28,145 --> 00:29:30,169
Good. So do I.

516
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:38,779
So, what did he say?

517
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:43,828
I got a lot of eye rolling and a lecture about faith.

518
00:29:45,154 --> 00:29:45,881
Sorry.

519
00:29:47,484 --> 00:29:49,506
Hey, you know what conversation we never finished?

520
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,529
I want to drive to Salt Lake City.

521
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,269
All right.

522
00:29:57,053 --> 00:29:59,087
Fine. It's just that, I mean,

523
00:29:59,138 --> 00:30:01,206
it's like we don't control our lives anymore.

524
00:30:02,312 --> 00:30:04,431
We plan a trip, you dream a dream, we can't go.

525
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:08,527
What happens when you have a dream about Christmas, going to the circus?

526
00:30:08,578 --> 00:30:10,193
We'll be prisoners in the house.

527
00:30:10,244 --> 00:30:13,894
Maybe, or maybe we'll be happy at home, having survived some awful calamity.

528
00:30:14,998 --> 00:30:16,733
So I gather last night, you dreamt again?

529
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,265
I found your wallet... in a debris field.

530
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,306
The plane was still smoldering.

531
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,199
Were you on the plane?

532
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:36,903
It's hard to say.

533
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,331
Why? I'd think it'd be fairly easy.

534
00:30:39,382 --> 00:30:42,942
Were you... burned, disoriented?

535
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,826
Were your clothes or your skin singed?

536
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,017
No.

537
00:30:49,443 --> 00:30:51,170
Then it sounds to me like you weren't on the plane.

538
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:51,932
If you weren't on the plane,

539
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,327
you can't have been dreaming about the trip we're making Friday.

540
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:56,484
- Joe...
- Hey, Allison, no.

541
00:30:56,535 --> 00:30:58,093
I am allowed-- in fact, I'm obligated--

542
00:30:58,144 --> 00:31:00,829
to inject a little freaking logic into this conversation.

543
00:31:01,984 --> 00:31:03,109
For God's sake.

544
00:31:03,818 --> 00:31:05,856
Do you have any idea how far Salt Lake City is?

545
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:08,464
I mean, shoot me, but I don't want to spend 11 freaking hours

546
00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:10,643
- Well, I don't want my family to die in a plane crash!
- with three kids in a car!

547
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:15,171
Wait a second. Who's going to die in a plane crash?

548
00:31:16,747 --> 00:31:17,648
Nobody, honey.

549
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:19,205
Nobody's going to die in a plane crash.

550
00:31:19,854 --> 00:31:22,356
I don't want to go on a plane that's going to crash.

551
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:25,892
Trust me, Bridge, planes don't crash... really.

552
00:31:25,943 --> 00:31:28,007
Almost never. They're amazingly safe.

553
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:32,437
Only people who are ignorant or superstitious stay off planes

554
00:31:32,488 --> 00:31:34,346
'cause they think they're going to crash.

555
00:31:53,506 --> 00:31:54,415
So...

556
00:31:55,062 --> 00:31:56,331
Don't worry. No dreams.

557
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:59,046
Not a single ignorant, superstitious one.

558
00:32:01,394 --> 00:32:02,640
Oh.

559
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:08,659
Hey, make sure you guys give these notes to your teachers

560
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,178
so they know why you're not in school tomorrow.

561
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:12,837
I don't get it-- are we driving or flying?
I can't keep it straight.

562
00:32:12,888 --> 00:32:15,406
We are flying.
Daddy and I talked about it, and we're flying.

563
00:32:15,457 --> 00:32:17,134
Al, Scanlon.

564
00:32:20,901 --> 00:32:22,778
- Good morning.|- John Hammond.

565
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:26,473
Who? I'm sorry.

566
00:32:26,524 --> 00:32:28,789
You ought to be. What kind of psychic are you, anyway?

567
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,619
John Hammond's the name of the man who snatched Isabel Navarro.

568
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:33,804
Allison?

569
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,524
Oh, my God. How?

570
00:32:37,097 --> 00:32:38,160
We caught a break.

571
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:40,198
Got a missing person's report on him.

572
00:32:40,265 --> 00:32:43,000
Turns out the guy hadn't shown up for work
since the day Isabel disappeared,

573
00:32:43,977 --> 00:32:45,562
and he's a parishioner at St. Brendan's,

574
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:47,498
so we sent a unit over to the house.

575
00:32:48,026 --> 00:32:50,086
Well, did you talk to him?
What did he say?

576
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,618
Well, you might have better luck with that.

577
00:32:53,256 --> 00:32:54,163
What do you mean?

578
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,911
He's dead, Allison.
Shot himself in the head.

579
00:32:59,012 --> 00:33:00,170
Last night, it looks like.

580
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,119
Last night? After mass?

581
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,525
What about Isabel?

582
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:07,804
She wasn't there.

583
00:33:08,507 --> 00:33:10,629
We're guessing wherever she is, she's been for a while.

584
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:16,737
It's not looking terribly promising, Allison.

585
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:19,946
I mean, maybe if we got to him last night...

586
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:23,584
You okay?

587
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:24,958
Yeah, I'm okay.

588
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,222
Just let me know what happens.

589
00:33:28,546 --> 00:33:30,064
I've got a trip to pack for.

590
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:43,099
Just a second!

591
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,033
Good morning, Mrs. Dubois.

592
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,758
Really? I think that depends on who you ask, Father.

593
00:33:56,515 --> 00:33:58,576
He was right there, wasn't he?

594
00:34:00,424 --> 00:34:02,322
I debated with myself for a long time

595
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,244
about whether I should come by or not.

596
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:05,707
I thought to myself,

597
00:34:05,758 --> 00:34:08,459
if she can really do what she claims she can do,

598
00:34:08,953 --> 00:34:10,667
then she'll know how sad I am.

599
00:34:11,544 --> 00:34:14,924
Know how sorry I am. Know that...

600
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,165
I had no other choice.

601
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:20,293
Well, I do know all that.

602
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,747
But I don't think it matters very much to Isabel Navarro.

603
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,074
I don't understand.

604
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:31,208
She is out there somewhere, and we will probably never find her.

605
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:33,608
And yet, you seem so calm.

606
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,513
I told you, I have faith.

607
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,229
Faith in God's wisdom.

608
00:34:39,274 --> 00:34:42,189
Faith that you and the people you work with will find her

609
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,460
if she's meant to be found.

610
00:34:43,511 --> 00:34:46,248
Faith that everything will happen the way it's supposed to.

611
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:49,088
I almost envy you.

612
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:52,222
I'm in here packing for my family to go to a wedding,

613
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:54,732
and I keep thinking I should be out there searching for her.

614
00:34:55,853 --> 00:34:57,116
You want my advice?

615
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,330
Go to the wedding.

616
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,400
Thank you, Father, but it's not what you think.

617
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,208
My husband's sister is getting married for the third time.

618
00:35:04,322 --> 00:35:05,926
I'm pretty sure the reception is B.Y.O...

619
00:35:05,977 --> 00:35:08,557
Doesn't matter. Go to the wedding.

620
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:11,562
Whatever you say, Father.

621
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:12,624
I'm serious.

622
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:17,299
Weddings are beginnings. They're hopeful.

623
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:21,758
Optimistic. You don't want to miss that.

624
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:27,174
God is watching over Isabel.

625
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,366
I hope so.

626
00:35:33,169 --> 00:35:35,775
Have a good trip, Mrs. Dubois.

627
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,875
Thank you.

628
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:40,820
I'll try.

629
00:35:45,255 --> 00:35:46,705
Al, you get the bedroom windows?

630
00:35:46,756 --> 00:35:48,568
Yes, for the third time.

631
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:50,659
Okay, we got to go!

632
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:52,670
Takes at least 45 minutes to get to the airport

633
00:35:52,721 --> 00:35:54,097
and a half hour to get through security.

634
00:35:54,148 --> 00:35:55,580
I'm with you.

635
00:35:56,508 --> 00:35:57,339
Where are you going?

636
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,042
Check the bedroom windows.

637
00:35:59,702 --> 00:36:01,249
- I'm ready.
- Great.

638
00:36:01,373 --> 00:36:02,997
Ariel, do me a favor. Go get Bridgette.

639
00:36:03,048 --> 00:36:04,714
Bridgette, come on!

640
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,047
I could've done that myself, sweetie.

641
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:09,479
Okay, I'll pack the car.

642
00:36:10,473 --> 00:36:12,630
Where's Bridgette?
Is she in the bathroom or something?

643
00:36:12,681 --> 00:36:14,850
Bridge, come on! We've got to go!

644
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,100
Bridge?!

645
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:21,344
I'll get her.

646
00:36:27,572 --> 00:36:29,632
Bridge? Come on, sweetie.

647
00:36:29,925 --> 00:36:32,252
We can play hide and seek at Aunt Tracy's, okay?

648
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:33,934
Honey, come on.

649
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:34,882
Bridge?

650
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:42,600
Bridge?

651
00:36:49,637 --> 00:36:50,911
Hey, sweetie.

652
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,475
I don't want to crash.

653
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,645
Honey, we're not gonna crash. I explained that to you.

654
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:58,559
But I keep dreaming it.

655
00:36:58,611 --> 00:37:00,881
The plane crashes into the dirt,

656
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,015
and then you end up hanging from a tree, all burned up.

657
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:07,325
I keep dreaming it.

658
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:14,405
What?

659
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:17,477
You never mentioned anything about a tree.

660
00:37:21,993 --> 00:37:24,346
Okay, that's it.

661
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:27,535
Everyone go to the bathroom. We're driving.

662
00:37:27,638 --> 00:37:29,106
What did you just say?!

663
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:30,391
We're driving.

664
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:32,592
Come on, it'll be fun.

665
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:34,683
I'm getting giddy just thinking about it.

666
00:37:34,758 --> 00:37:36,696
Come on, let's go get some CDs.

667
00:37:39,078 --> 00:37:39,678
Joe.

668
00:37:39,638 --> 00:37:43,093
I can count. Two psychics against one engineer.

669
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:44,849
It's no contest-- we're driving.

670
00:37:48,645 --> 00:37:51,070
We got all the kids' allergy stuff.

671
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:55,173
Something to remove toenail fungus,

672
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:57,557
but no Tylenol.

673
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,221
Shh, oh, baby girl.

674
00:38:01,227 --> 00:38:02,837
Shh. Shh. Shh.

675
00:38:03,436 --> 00:38:04,874
She definitely has a fever.

676
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:06,373
Of course, she does.

677
00:38:06,426 --> 00:38:08,667
We're in the middle of nowhere, five hours from home.

678
00:38:09,517 --> 00:38:10,791
Of course, she has a fever.

679
00:38:19,642 --> 00:38:20,953
What did you do?

680
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,764
It's the power of prayer.

681
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:31,388
You know, I couldn't help it, I called.

682
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:32,881
I checked on our flight.

683
00:38:33,534 --> 00:38:35,811
It landed in Salt Lake safe and sound--

684
00:38:36,218 --> 00:38:38,113
five minutes early, in fact.

685
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:40,725
Okay.

686
00:38:42,564 --> 00:38:44,735
It's always going to be like this, isn't it?

687
00:38:46,393 --> 00:38:48,161
Worrying about what's gonna happen.

688
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:52,160
We have three kids.

689
00:38:52,682 --> 00:38:54,336
We have a pretty great life.

690
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:57,338
I think worrying just comes with the territory.

691
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,982
Dreams or no dreams.

692
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:02,997
Okay, enough is enough.

693
00:39:03,048 --> 00:39:03,967
Sweetheart.

694
00:39:04,018 --> 00:39:05,393
All right, this girl has a fever.

695
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:06,910
I'm gonna go find a drug store.

696
00:39:51,635 --> 00:39:53,152
Can you hear me now?

697
00:39:54,463 --> 00:39:55,410
No.

698
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:07,982
Hello?!

699
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,272
Hello!

700
00:40:20,341 --> 00:40:21,288
Hello!

701
00:40:24,484 --> 00:40:25,858
Anybody home?!

702
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,169
Oh, great.

703
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:10,764
Hello? Joe?

704
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:14,528
No, I'm just happy to hear your voice that's all.

705
00:41:20,743 --> 00:41:22,175
Honey, the Jeep broke down.

706
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:25,341
I'm in a big white barn right off Route 59.

707
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:41,056
Hold on a second.

708
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:46,957
Joe, I need you to call the police.

709
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,647
No, I'm fine!

710
00:41:48,983 --> 00:41:50,245
I think I found her.

711
00:41:50,544 --> 00:41:51,393
Yeah.
