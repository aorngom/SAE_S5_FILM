1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,500
My God, John.

2
00:00:08,104 --> 00:00:10,439
Look at you.

3
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:26,355
I just talked to your doctors.

4
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:28,090
You're dying.

5
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:31,594
I want you to admit
what you did, John.

6
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:34,096
I want you to admit
what you are.

9
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:46,208
Shauna Gage.

10
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:49,044
Kristen Hartley.

11
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:50,879
Francine Bickford.

12
00:00:50,947 --> 00:00:53,349
Ann Marie Mays.

13
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:59,288
I want you to say
that you did it, John.

14
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:02,124
I want you to say it to me.

15
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:05,594
I'm the only one who still
cares about what you did.

16
00:01:05,662 --> 00:01:08,697
The police stopped
investigating these murders years ago.

17
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:10,833
Look at you, John.

18
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,669
They can't put you in prison now.

19
00:01:13,737 --> 00:01:15,804
You beat us all.

20
00:01:15,872 --> 00:01:17,940
You got away with it.

21
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:20,743
Don't you want to take
the credit for that?

22
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:26,282
Cigarette?

26
00:02:00,383 --> 00:02:01,717
Now...

27
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:04,486
Tell me.

28
00:02:04,554 --> 00:02:07,056
You did it,didn't you?

29
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:21,770
No.

30
00:02:26,643 --> 00:02:28,277
You're lying.

31
00:02:28,345 --> 00:02:29,712
Wake up.

32
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:31,146
Come on, wake up

33
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:32,548
And admit you did it!

34
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:33,816
Admit it was you,

35
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:35,351
You bastard!

36
00:02:35,418 --> 00:02:36,719
Admit it was you!

37
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:38,721
Admit it was you, you bastard!

38
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:40,255
Admit it was you!

39
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:41,323
Admit it!

40
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:43,592
Admit it!

41
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,961
Admit...

42
00:02:46,029 --> 00:02:49,965
<i>S06E04
The Medium is the Message</i>

44
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:33,851
Arrow, hand.

45
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,319
Perfect.

46
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:36,954
How about...

47
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:38,189
that?

48
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:40,124
Arrow, fish, hand,

49
00:03:40,192 --> 00:03:41,292
Star, pyramid.

50
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,060
Excellent.

51
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:44,228
I don't understand.

52
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:45,396
How is that rehab?

53
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:47,431
I mean, anyone can read flash cards

54
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:48,733
without words on 'em.

55
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,067
No, see, you're wrong.


56
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:52,069
When people go through
something like mom,

57
00:03:52,137 --> 00:03:54,105
when they're in a coma for a while,

58
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:56,340
sometimes they mess up
the way they see things.

59
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:58,109
So it's important for mom to do

60
00:03:58,176 --> 00:04:00,611
her drills, so that
we know that mom's head

61
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:01,979
is working right.

62
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:03,981
Actually,the official term
for what your mom is doing

63
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,082
Is "cognitive therapy."

64
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:09,320
When she does it...
which is not often enough.

65
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:10,488
I'm fine.

66
00:04:10,555 --> 00:04:11,989
My cognitive skills are excellent.

67
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:14,291
When it comes to seeing stars,
fish, and arrows,

68
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,594
I'm at the top of my game.
How about

69
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:19,530
We let the folks
at rehab decide that?

70
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:22,500
You look nice, daddy.

71
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:24,168
Thank you.

72
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:27,338
Here's hoping the good people
at burroughs-strauss agree.

73
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:28,673
Now, wait a second.

74
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,675
Didn't you already
dress up and go there?

75
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:31,942
Good memory.

76
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,778
Excellent cognition, bridge.

77
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:35,680
Yes, indeed.I had
a good first meeting there,

78
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:37,348
And today is the big day,

79
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,550
Because today I meet the guy who, 

80
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:41,652
Who runs the department,
and if everything

81
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,587
Goes well with him
and I impress him,

82
00:04:43,655 --> 00:04:46,757
Well, then I may be done
with dressing up

83
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:49,827
And interviewing for a while,
maybe even forever.

84
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:52,229
Hey, you know what.
We got to get a move on.

85
00:04:52,297 --> 00:04:54,265
I got to be at therapy in 45 minutes.

86
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:56,000
Mommy, did you sign my thing?

87
00:04:56,068 --> 00:05:00,471
Oh, right, the permission slip
for that field trip next week.

88
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:03,541
I just have to remember
where I put it.

89
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:06,577
You can't remember where
you put that thing?

90
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,381
Hey, you know what, I'm gonna make

91
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:11,816
My own permission slip.

92
00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:14,685
I'm gonna make a note for your teacher,

93
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:18,022
And if she has any problems,
she can call me, okay?

94
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,324
Okay, mommy.

95
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:22,693
Dollar sign, triangle, hammer,

96
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:25,429
House, and that last one, I don't know

97
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:28,598
What you would call it...
looks... Kind of like a tunnel?

98
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,100
A tunnel? Really?

99
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:33,203
Are you sure you don't want
to take another look?

100
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:37,607
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:39,276
It's a tree.

102
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:42,345
That's so weird, the first time
I looked at it... I wouldn't worry

103
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:43,914
About it, Allison.
it's really common

104
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:45,816
For someone recovering from a stroke

105
00:05:45,883 --> 00:05:49,853
To have lapses in memory,
gaps in perception.

106
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:51,488
We call it "expressive aphasia."

107
00:05:51,556 --> 00:05:54,257
The flash card exercises
just work the muscle,

108
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:56,359
Keep it from getting too serious.

109
00:05:56,427 --> 00:05:58,061
But my stroke was months ago.

110
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:59,296
I've been fine.

111
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:01,865
I haven't had any
perception problems before.

112
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,800
These things come and go.

113
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:06,903
The one thing that really
helps is practice.

114
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:09,306
Have you been using
your cards at home?

115
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:11,775
Well, I did look at them
this morning...

116
00:06:11,843 --> 00:06:14,077
It probably wouldn't hurt

117
00:06:14,145 --> 00:06:16,580
<i>For you to be a little
more disciplined.</i>

119
00:06:17,982 --> 00:06:19,282
Okay.

121
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:36,800
Someone's got flash card anxiety.

122
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:40,103
Sorry.

123
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:42,105
I couldn't help myself.

124
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:44,107
I was watching you.

125
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:45,575
It's that obvious?

126
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:47,143
Well, for me it is.

127
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:51,147
But I've been playing
with those cards for years.

128
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:53,783
You want a little tip?

129
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:57,654
Try reading them from right to left.

130
00:06:57,722 --> 00:07:00,156
Yeah. I know it sounds stupid,

131
00:07:00,224 --> 00:07:03,093
But there's something
about reading them backwards

132
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,862
That forces your brain
to pay attention.

133
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,498
At least... It works for me.

134
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:11,401
Well, thanks. I'll try that.

135
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:13,770
My name's Neal, by the way.

136
00:07:13,838 --> 00:07:16,106
I'm a veteran
of more cognitive therapy

137
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:18,208
Than you'd ever care to remember.

138
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:21,411
My name's Allison. Allison Dubois.

140
00:07:22,947 --> 00:07:26,182
You said that you'd-you'd had
a lot of therapy.

141
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,953
Do you mind if I ask you
what happened to you?

142
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:32,122
I got mugged.

143
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:34,391
Guy shot me,

144
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,193
Left me to bleed in the street.

145
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:39,362
Had some...

146
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,197
Brain impairment.

147
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:44,167
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.
Thanks.

148
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:45,635
Wherever the guy is,

149
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:49,306
I hope he had a good time
with the $22 he took from me.

150
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,207
They never found the man
who did this to you?

151
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:52,909
No.

152
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:55,645
Forgive me.

153
00:07:57,782 --> 00:07:59,716
Oh, it's a work call.

154
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:02,986
Remember: Try to read them backwards.

155
00:08:03,054 --> 00:08:05,188
Hello?

156
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:07,123
Sorry to bother you on your day off,

157
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:10,226
But I was hoping maybe
you could meet me at the morgue.

158
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:12,162
The girl's name's Catherine Tallridge.

159
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:14,598
My best guess is about 1:00 last night

160
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:16,333
Someone came up the fire escape,

161
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,401
Broke into her place through a window,

162
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:20,670
Strangled her,
then left the way he came.

163
00:08:20,738 --> 00:08:22,405
How can you be so sure

164
00:08:22,473 --> 00:08:24,741
It was around 1:00?
One of the neighbors

165
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:26,576
Heard a commotion coming from the place.

166
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:28,411
He even called in a noise complaint.

167
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,247
By the time the squad car got there,
everything was quiet.

168
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:33,350
No one answered the door.

169
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:34,551
The roommate got back

170
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:35,986
From sleeping over
at her friend's place.

171
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:40,423
Found her like that.

172
00:08:41,926 --> 00:08:44,194
You have any idea what that symbol

173
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:45,862
On her head means?

174
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,497
Symbol?

175
00:08:50,935 --> 00:08:53,303
Obviously, my most recent experience

176
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:55,238
Is with solar cells.

178
00:08:57,074 --> 00:08:59,709
I know it's not
a perfect fit for, you know,

179
00:08:59,777 --> 00:09:02,545
What you do here, but I figure
there are some parallels

180
00:09:02,613 --> 00:09:05,081
That make me a... Good candidate.

182
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:09,786
Solar, huh?

183
00:09:09,854 --> 00:09:12,622
Yeah.I started a company;
I sold it last year.

184
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,391
Did your human resources department

185
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,159
Not send you down a résumé?

187
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:23,333
Yeah,I think that they
probably sent me something.

188
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:26,269
Well, my team and I were...

189
00:09:26,337 --> 00:09:28,638
Projecting sales for the company.

191
00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:32,308
We did a lot of research

192
00:09:32,376 --> 00:09:34,411
Into biofuels 'cause
we figured they'd be

193
00:09:34,478 --> 00:09:36,680
our biggest competitor
in ten years or so.

194
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:40,917
Sorry. I've just got to take
a look at this real quick.

195
00:09:40,985 --> 00:09:42,452
I'm listening, though.

196
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,287
Yes,some of the research,

197
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:46,589
Some of the reading
that I did that made me wish

198
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:49,592
That I was working in the field,
so I, you know, I'd love to...

199
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,362
To... To...

200
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,698
Dive in with you.

203
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:03,206
Hello?

205
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:07,077
No, no, it's good timing.

206
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:09,079
I just got done with the interview.

207
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:11,081
Listen, I appreciate you...

208
00:10:11,148 --> 00:10:12,816
Appreciate you setting it up
and everything,

209
00:10:12,883 --> 00:10:14,818
But I don't think it went very well.

211
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:19,723
What do you mean, the guy loved me?

212
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,391
My god, Joe, that's fantastic!

213
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:23,159
When are you supposed to start?

214
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:26,996
Human resources told drew
I could start whenever I'm ready.

215
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:29,632
I'm not working,
so I told him I'm ready now.

216
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,768
I guess as of tomorrow
there's gonna be

217
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:33,636
Two steady paychecks
coming in the house.

218
00:10:33,704 --> 00:10:34,738
You "guess"?

219
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:36,106
You don't sound happy.

220
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:37,741
I thought you really wanted this.

221
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:40,243
No,I do.I do.I just...

222
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:42,011
I thought I completely
screwed the interview.

223
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,181
I thought the guy hated me,
and then they offered me the job

224
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:47,183
Before I could even
drive off the property.

225
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:49,686
You know what that means?
You're just that good.

226
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:52,589
Honey, hold on a second.

227
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:55,892
I'm not paying attention
where I'm going.

228
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:02,332
Hey, Al, you there?

229
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,767
Did I lose you?

231
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:18,014
Al, you all right?

232
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:20,717
Yeah, honey.

233
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,191
I'm fine. Let me call you back.

235
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:13,636
Admit it was you, you bastard!
Admit it was you!

236
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:27,217
"I had been pursuing
the libra for ten years.

237
00:12:27,284 --> 00:12:31,754
"it became an obsession that cost me
my career and my marriage.

238
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:34,257
"and so, when I went
to visit john david boatner

239
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:36,092
"in the hospice where he lay dying,

240
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,529
<i>"when he finally admitted
that he was the libra,</i>

241
00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:44,367
"it was, in an odd way, the most
intimate moment of my life,

242
00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:48,872
And, I suspect, it was the most
intimate moment of his life."

243
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:52,141
Thank you.

244
00:12:53,177 --> 00:12:56,112
There you go.

245
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,547
Hi.

246
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,184
Should I make it out
to someone in particular?

247
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:02,752
Actually, if you've got a minute,

248
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,220
Can I ask you a question?

249
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:05,288
Sure.

250
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:06,856
When this was all going on,

251
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:08,625
When the libra slayer

252
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,593
Was originally murdering young women,

253
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:12,228
I'd just given birth
to my second daughter,

254
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:13,663
And I was in the hospital.

255
00:13:13,731 --> 00:13:16,332
I really wasn't paying
much attention to the papers.

256
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,569
Was these the sort of letters

257
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:21,638
That he would send the police?

258
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:23,940
He used a different code
for each murder.

259
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:26,910
And what is this?

260
00:13:26,977 --> 00:13:28,144
That's the sign of the libra.

261
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:29,545
I guess you could call it
his signature.

262
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:31,180
He carved it into each one
of his victims.

263
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:36,486
And is this the man that you
think was the libra slayer?

264
00:13:36,553 --> 00:13:40,256
I don't think john david boatner
was the libra slayer.

265
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:41,724
I know it.

266
00:13:43,394 --> 00:13:44,460
Are you sure?

267
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:45,895
Weren't there any other suspects?

268
00:13:45,963 --> 00:13:46,963
I'm positive.

269
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:48,765
I've written three books
on the subject,

270
00:13:48,832 --> 00:13:51,501
And I personally collected
reams of evidence.

271
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:53,069
Plus, he told me he did it.

272
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:56,072
When I went to visit him
right before he died,

273
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,641
I told him if he didn't admit
that he was the libra slayer,

274
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,944
Then no one would ever know
that he'd beaten the police.

275
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:02,745
He told you he didn't do it.

276
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:07,216
You gave him a cigarette.

277
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:09,452
He told you he was not the murderer.

278
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,221
Look, I know you spent years
believing it was him.

279
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:13,656
I can kind of understand

280
00:14:13,724 --> 00:14:16,426
Why you would lie about
what happened in the hospice,

281
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:18,995
But I think you're wrong
about boatner.

282
00:14:19,063 --> 00:14:20,930
A young woman died last night.

283
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:23,399
I think she was murdered
by the same person

284
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:24,801
Who committed
the original libra slayings.

285
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,838
I think he's back.

286
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,682
Let's say you're right.

287
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,118
Let's say that john david boatner

288
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:39,954
Didn't confess on his deathbed.

289
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:43,124
That doesn't necessarily mean
he wasn't the killer.

290
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:45,026
I mean, in my experience

291
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,295
Serial murder and a deep-seated
sense of honesty

292
00:14:47,362 --> 00:14:48,896
Rarely go hand in hand.

293
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:52,333
Yeah, but there's a reason the
police never arrested boatner

294
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:53,968
For the libra's killings.

295
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:55,436
They never had enough evidence.

296
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:57,939
I've been researching this.

297
00:14:58,006 --> 00:14:59,574
In fact, there's
a fair amount of evidence

298
00:14:59,641 --> 00:15:01,676
To suggest he wasn't the killer.

299
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:03,578
They were never able
to conclusively prove

300
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:05,012
That his handwriting was a match

301
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,714
For any of the libra's notes.

302
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:07,949
There was never any physical evidence

303
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:09,917
To tie him to any of the crime scenes.

304
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:11,619
Well, even if all that's true...

305
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:13,688
Even if john david boatner is innocent,

306
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:15,523
I don't see anything that indicates

307
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:17,825
That the libra killed
Catherine Tallridge.

308
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:20,061
He was flamboyant,

309
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,462
A game-player,

310
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,465
Taunting the police with...
With cryptograms,

311
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,867
Carving his signature into
the foreheads of his victims.

312
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:27,902
He took credit.

313
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,337
He liked taking credit.

314
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:31,172
Now if you're correct,

315
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,074
And this man is still walking,

316
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,809
Still killing among us,

317
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:36,644
Why didn't he take credit
for this death?

318
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:38,246
No symbol was carved in her forehead.

319
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,749
No coded message was left
for the police to decrypt.

320
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:44,819
If he killed her,
wouldn't he want the world to know?

321
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:47,321
I think he wanted to.
I think he ran out of time.

322
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:48,956
A neighbor heard noises coming

323
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:50,424
From inside
Catherine Tallridge's apartment

324
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,759
The night that she was murdered.

325
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,127
She called the police.

326
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:54,662
I think he had to run out of there.

327
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,130
He didn't have time to sign his work.

329
00:15:58,734 --> 00:16:03,404
I'm sorry, but I think you need
to... Rethink your theory.

330
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:04,839
That was the medical examiner.

331
00:16:04,906 --> 00:16:06,707
Catherine Tallridge's wounds

332
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:09,777
Were inflicted by
an left-handed attacker.

333
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,880
The libra, as I'm sure you know
from your research,

334
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:13,948
Was right-handed.

335
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:16,751
I'm home.

337
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:23,557
Hey, where is everybody?

338
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,059
Homework.

339
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:30,398
I picked up a fudge ripple cake
on the way home to celebrate.

340
00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:34,402
What's with the long face?

341
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:36,070
You got a new job.

342
00:16:36,138 --> 00:16:37,638
Everything all right?

343
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,608
I was just about to ask you that.

344
00:16:40,676 --> 00:16:42,576
This is the note that you wrote

345
00:16:42,644 --> 00:16:44,378
To marie's teacher this morning.

346
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:45,680
She sent it back.

347
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:57,091
Car keys and your wallet now!

348
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:59,994
Come on. Give me your wallet!

349
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,496
Give me your wallet right now.

350
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,465
Now your keys. Let's go.

351
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,000
Let's go!

352
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,735
Man, let me... Let me have my car.

353
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:09,337
I just need to get to work,
and, you know...

354
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,805
You don't give me those keys,

355
00:17:10,872 --> 00:17:13,307
You're not going to need
anything ever again.

361
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:57,385
You must be the new guy.

362
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,754
Joe Dubois. Welcome aboard, Joe.

363
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:01,655
Brian Fondran.

364
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:05,493
Hey, brian, can I ask you a question?

365
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,494
Yeah, shoot.

366
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:07,962
How do we get started here?

367
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:09,964
I didn't see any kind of
staff meeting on the calendar.

368
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:15,069
Yeah,we don't really do
staff meetings here.

369
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,570
Really? Well, how do you find out

370
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:17,838
What you're supposed to be doing?

371
00:18:17,906 --> 00:18:19,540
How do you... ?
Well, who sets the agenda?

372
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:21,409
Who establishes, like,
the thresholds for projects?

373
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:25,646
Well... Nobody, really.

375
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:30,117
This job is a little more
read and react,

376
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:31,652
You know what I mean?

377
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,789
Basically, you just wait

378
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:37,725
Until keith asks you to do something.

379
00:18:37,793 --> 00:18:39,693
You met keith, right?

380
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:43,097
Yeah. So...

381
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:46,066
I would just wait.

382
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:51,806
Neal.

383
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:57,278
Allison. Hi.

384
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,347
I'd ask you to join me, but...

385
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:01,482
Oh, no.

386
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,684
Actually, I left my sneakers in the car.

387
00:19:03,752 --> 00:19:05,352
I came to see you.

388
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,654
Oh, thank you.

389
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:08,355
I don't know if I mentioned yesterday...

390
00:19:08,423 --> 00:19:10,724
I work with the district
attorney's office.

391
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:13,327
I know who you are.

392
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:15,062
I watch the news.

393
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,865
You're... A professional dreamer, right?

394
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:20,568
Well, I don't know how professional I am,

395
00:19:20,635 --> 00:19:23,370
But I do dream from time to time.

396
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:25,306
I actually had a dream

397
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,875
About you last night.

398
00:19:27,943 --> 00:19:31,245
I saw the man who shot you.
I saw his face.

399
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:36,150
I don't understand.

400
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,319
The man who shot me
was wearing a ski mask.

401
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,720
I never even saw his face.

402
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:41,222
And it was 11 years ago.

403
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:42,423
That's fine,mr. Greybridge.

404
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:43,858
All we need for you to do

405
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:46,961
Is to recognize his voice.

406
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:49,096
A voice id would give us probable cause

407
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:51,599
To compel a dna sample.

408
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,367
If that matches the sample
the police found

409
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:55,302
Under your fingernails
the night you were shot,

410
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,371
Then we should have everything
we need to convict.

411
00:19:57,439 --> 00:20:00,174
Are you ready?

412
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,877
Okay.

413
00:20:05,547 --> 00:20:09,049
Number one, please step forward
and read from the card.

414
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,354
"you don't give me those keys,

415
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,090
You're not going to need
anything ever again."

416
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:20,561
I don't think so.

417
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:22,029
Thank you, number one.

418
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:25,165
Number two, please step forward
and read from the card.

419
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:26,934
"you don't give me those keys,

420
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:29,937
You're not going to need
anything ever again."

421
00:20:30,005 --> 00:20:33,674
I don't know.

422
00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:35,509
Maybe.

423
00:20:35,577 --> 00:20:38,679
I'm sorry. It was...
It was a long time ago.

424
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,114
You're doing fine.

425
00:20:40,181 --> 00:20:42,082
Remember, you don't have
to worry about their faces.

426
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,319
You don't even have to look
at their faces if you don't want to.

427
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:51,258
Number three, please
step forward and read the card.

428
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:55,930
"you don't give me those keys,

429
00:20:55,997 --> 00:20:57,798
You're not going to need
anything ever again."

430
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:06,240
That's him.

431
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:09,944
I'm sure of it.

432
00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:14,515
I don't even need to hear anyone else.

433
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:18,586
That's the man that shot me.

434
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,754
I'm get a uniform
to start the processing.

435
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,757
We should be able to do
the dna test this afternoon.

436
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,025
Thanks for all your help, Lee.

437
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:26,427
I know how busy you've been.

438
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,362
Easiest case I ever closed.

439
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,830
Thank you.

440
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,002
You okay?

441
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,237
Yeah.

442
00:21:39,975 --> 00:21:42,443
Thank you, Allison.

444
00:21:46,314 --> 00:21:47,314
Hi, keith.

445
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:51,986
Joe. Joe Dubois.

446
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:53,921
You just hired me.

447
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:55,723
Today's my first day...
was my first day.

448
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,890
It's 5:30.

449
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,593
Yeah, no problem.

450
00:21:59,661 --> 00:22:02,463
We'll see you tomorrow.

452
00:22:03,832 --> 00:22:06,133
Could I ask you something?

453
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:09,670
I spent the whole day out there,

454
00:22:09,738 --> 00:22:12,506
And I read the company handbook,

455
00:22:12,574 --> 00:22:15,509
And I did the whole orientation.

456
00:22:15,577 --> 00:22:17,978
But nobody actually
spoke to me about work.

457
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,547
Nobody filled me in on any projects,

458
00:22:20,615 --> 00:22:25,352
told me, you know, to do anything.

459
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,656
You maybe waiting for me to
come to you with something?

460
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,591
Like an idea or something?

461
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:35,362
No one explained it to you?

463
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:43,437
This department

464
00:22:43,505 --> 00:22:46,874
may run a little differently
than what you're used to.

465
00:22:46,941 --> 00:22:47,975
Okay, that's all right.

466
00:22:48,043 --> 00:22:49,076
No problem. I'll adjust.

467
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:50,511
Just tell me what you need.

468
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,979
That's the thing.

469
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:54,114
I don't... I don't really need anything.

470
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,719
The truth is I prefer to be

471
00:22:58,787 --> 00:23:01,388
The only engineer on my projects.

472
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:04,358
Honestly, I find it streamlines things.

473
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,893
You know?

474
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,395
Collaboration can just be distracting.

475
00:23:08,463 --> 00:23:09,463
Right?

476
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:12,099
I'm sorry, you saying that

477
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:14,268
You're never going to ask me
to do anything?

478
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:16,937
Not very often, no.

479
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:19,073
Why did you hire me?

480
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:23,777
Corporate gives me

481
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:25,479
A certain amount of money for staffing.

482
00:23:25,547 --> 00:23:26,980
And you know the way

483
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:28,048
That corporate budgets work.

484
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,950
If you don't use that money, then,

485
00:23:30,018 --> 00:23:32,286
Well, it goes away.

486
00:23:32,353 --> 00:23:33,320
But who knows?

487
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:35,489
In the future,
I might need it, right?

488
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:38,425
So I hire people.

490
00:23:43,164 --> 00:23:47,668
Yeah, I find that most people
don't have a problem with this.

491
00:23:47,736 --> 00:23:51,672
Most people actually think
it's a dream come true.

492
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,308
So... You know, 

493
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:59,113
Maybe if you think about this
as a kind of scholarship.

494
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,217
You're free to spend your days
working on whatever you want.

495
00:24:03,284 --> 00:24:05,953
You're just not going to be
working on biodiesels.

496
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,454
<i>Turns out I could've been anyone.</i>

497
00:24:07,522 --> 00:24:09,022
Maybe I was just the last interview.

498
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,791
Maybe he was just tired
of seeing people.

499
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:11,959
Wait, he's just

500
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:13,861
Going to pay you
to sit there and do nothing?

501
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:15,629
Yeah, that's what he said.

502
00:24:15,697 --> 00:24:18,465
He said to think of it
as a kind of scholarship.

503
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:21,135
I mean, it's not like I'm going
to turn down the money.

504
00:24:21,202 --> 00:24:22,536
I mean, truth is, I can't.

505
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:24,638
But I don't know.

506
00:24:24,706 --> 00:24:27,040
I mean, I know there are
a lot of people out there

507
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:29,276
Who'd kill to be, you know,
getting a paycheck right now,

508
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,344
Any kind of paycheck.

509
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,249
But I honestly don't know
if I can do it.

510
00:24:35,316 --> 00:24:39,553
I don't know if I can get up
every morning and go into work,

511
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:41,789
Knowing that my being there
is of no consequence.

512
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,824
Well, it will change
once he gets to know you,

513
00:24:43,892 --> 00:24:45,793
Once he sees what he has...

514
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,960
You don't understand.

515
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,662
He doesn't want to know what he has.

516
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,131
And he certainly doesn't
want to get to know me.

517
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,566
Okay, that's enough whining.

518
00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:55,836
I got to get my beauty sleep,
so I can get up bright and early

519
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:57,504
And go into work and do nothing.

520
00:25:39,168 --> 00:25:41,402
"10:21: Jacinda birk
stands at her window.

521
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:45,073
"she sees a view of edison park,
but cannot see me watching.

522
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,975
"when she is asleep, I will go to her.

523
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:48,876
When she is asleep,
I will make her mine."

524
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:51,246
And it goes on like that
for the remainder of the page.

525
00:25:51,313 --> 00:25:55,516
Took a team of experts
about ten hours to decode it.

526
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:58,219
You were right
about Catherine Tallridge.

527
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:01,022
He confesses to her murder
about five lines down.

528
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,258
Are we sure this is authentic?

529
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:05,927
Are we sure this is written
by the original libra slayer?

530
00:26:05,995 --> 00:26:08,129
I'm afraid we can't
be certain about that.

531
00:26:08,197 --> 00:26:09,998
When the libra slayer was last active,

532
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:12,767
He left coded messages
with the body of each victim.

533
00:26:12,835 --> 00:26:15,203
Now, each of these codes was unique,

534
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:19,340
But all of the translated
messages had a specific voice:

535
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:22,210
Arrogant, derisive, almost clinical

536
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:23,511
In the recording of detail.

537
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:26,214
The time of day,
the victim's full name,

538
00:26:26,282 --> 00:26:28,216
References to the location.

539
00:26:28,284 --> 00:26:30,885
Now, this new message...both in tone

540
00:26:30,953 --> 00:26:33,121
And in the complexity
of the code itself...

541
00:26:33,188 --> 00:26:34,455
Appears to be identical

542
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:36,291
To the messages left by the libra.

543
00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:39,694
It even refers to details
of the original crimes

544
00:26:39,762 --> 00:26:41,195
That were held back from the press.

545
00:26:41,263 --> 00:26:42,563
Seems unlikely that anyone

546
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:45,600
But the original killer would know them.

547
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:49,704
On the other hand, there is one
detail that doesn't line up.

548
00:26:49,772 --> 00:26:51,739
According to the medical examiner,

549
00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:55,276
Both Catherine Tallridge
and jacinda birk

550
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:57,111
Were murdered by
a left-handed assailant.

551
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:58,913
But isn't it common knowledge?

552
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:00,648
Isn't the libra slayer right-handed?

553
00:27:00,716 --> 00:27:01,916
So we always believed.

554
00:27:01,984 --> 00:27:03,251
But this new cryptogram...

555
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:05,286
It was written by somebody
who's left-handed.

556
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:09,057
Whoever killed these women, if
not the original libra slayer,

557
00:27:09,124 --> 00:27:13,061
Then it's someone who's doing
things the exact same way,

558
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:15,296
But using the other hand.

560
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:19,333
Talk to me.

561
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,568
I was wondering if you'd had a chance

562
00:27:21,636 --> 00:27:24,238
To look at the schematic
that I left for you at lunch.

563
00:27:24,305 --> 00:27:26,840
It's 5:30; everyone's taking off.

564
00:27:26,908 --> 00:27:28,575
I just didn't want to go

565
00:27:28,643 --> 00:27:31,345
If you were planning
on giving me any feedback...

566
00:27:31,412 --> 00:27:34,815
Any reaction, a direction of some sort.

567
00:27:34,882 --> 00:27:38,719
You talking about that wiring thing?

568
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:40,887
Yeah,that wasn't something

569
00:27:40,955 --> 00:27:42,389
That I asked you to do.

570
00:27:42,457 --> 00:27:44,091
I know.

571
00:27:47,128 --> 00:27:49,496
I read it.

572
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:50,497
It wasn't bad.

573
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:51,965
Oh, really?
Do you want to sit down?

574
00:27:52,033 --> 00:27:54,167
Maybe we could set up a time
we could go over it?

575
00:27:54,235 --> 00:27:55,802
It wasn't bad.

576
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,537
It just wasn't excellent.

577
00:27:57,605 --> 00:28:00,173
You know, I mean, frankly,

578
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:02,542
What was the point?

579
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,245
No offense,
but I don't really have any use

580
00:28:05,313 --> 00:28:06,880
For that kind of work.

581
00:28:06,948 --> 00:28:10,717
I mean, like I told you,
I can get to excellent on my own.

582
00:28:10,785 --> 00:28:12,019
So...

583
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:14,354
Really?

584
00:28:14,422 --> 00:28:16,623
I was actually thinking

585
00:28:16,691 --> 00:28:19,493
About that wiring problem
today at lunch.

586
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:26,199
I came up with some
pretty interesting stuff.

587
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:28,268
You can take a look if you want.

588
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:34,007
Thank you.

589
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:38,912
I meant it.

590
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,981
It wasn't bad.

591
00:28:42,984 --> 00:28:45,118
You're a smart guy.

592
00:28:45,186 --> 00:28:48,722
Which means that you're
going to be miserable here.

593
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,057
I'm not saying that I'm unhappy.

594
00:28:50,124 --> 00:28:51,158
It's just my second day.

595
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:53,160
No, I know you're not griping.

596
00:28:53,227 --> 00:28:54,661
I just...

597
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:56,797
I know how this is going to play out.

598
00:28:56,864 --> 00:28:58,765
Most people, they come here,

599
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:02,669
They figure out how I like
to operate pretty quickly.

600
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:05,772
You know, they settle in
to doing whatever.

601
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,608
They like doing whatever.

602
00:29:08,676 --> 00:29:13,246
But you... Have initiative.

603
00:29:13,314 --> 00:29:16,049
The trouble is,
I have no use for that.

605
00:29:22,523 --> 00:29:24,891
I'll tell you what.

606
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:26,259
I'm gonna e-mail the guy

607
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:29,196
That runs the commercial
aeronautics division.

608
00:29:29,263 --> 00:29:30,764
They got some new contracts.

609
00:29:30,832 --> 00:29:32,299
They're probably looking for talent.

610
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:34,634
I could offer to take
one of their worst guys

611
00:29:34,702 --> 00:29:35,736
In exchange for you.

612
00:29:35,803 --> 00:29:38,305
You're gonna trade me?

613
00:29:38,373 --> 00:29:40,307
Sure. Yeah.

614
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:41,675
You'll like it down there.

615
00:29:41,743 --> 00:29:44,344
They do some kind of
interesting stuff with turbines.

617
00:29:53,154 --> 00:29:54,688
You look like you're cramming

618
00:29:54,756 --> 00:29:56,189
For the world's most gruesome final.

619
00:29:56,257 --> 00:29:57,190
Yeah, well,

620
00:29:57,258 --> 00:29:58,291
The way this is going,

621
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:00,160
You might as well just hand me an "f."

622
00:30:00,228 --> 00:30:02,562
I hope you guys
are learning more than I am.

623
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,464
We've got half the homicide
division pulling overtime.

624
00:30:04,532 --> 00:30:06,600
So far, not much in the way of results.

626
00:30:13,174 --> 00:30:16,643
Your friend Neal Greybridge,

627
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:18,412
The assistant district attorney

628
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:20,080
In charge of his case, called me.

629
00:30:20,148 --> 00:30:21,915
Apparently, they scheduled
a sit-down with him.

630
00:30:21,983 --> 00:30:24,584
They're building a case against
the guy who shot him, so, 

631
00:30:24,652 --> 00:30:26,520
You know, they need
to go over his statement,

632
00:30:26,587 --> 00:30:28,588
Talk to him about taking the stand.

633
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:30,457
Only problem is Neal never showed up.

634
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,260
I hope he's okay.

635
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:34,261
I keep calling him.

636
00:30:34,328 --> 00:30:35,262
I know the ada.

637
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:36,763
Left him a couple messages.

638
00:30:36,831 --> 00:30:38,632
But you know this guy.

639
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:40,967
I was thinking maybe
you could reach out to him.

640
00:30:41,035 --> 00:30:43,270
Just make sure
he isn't gonna flake out on us.

641
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:44,638
<i>Hi, it's Neal.</i>

642
00:30:44,705 --> 00:30:45,972
<i>Leave me your name and number,</i>

643
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,041
And I'll call you back
as soon as I can.

644
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:49,242
Hi, Neal.

645
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,877
This is Allison Dubois again.

646
00:30:50,945 --> 00:30:52,412
Sorry to leave you another message.

647
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,815
Just calling to make sure
that you check in

648
00:30:54,882 --> 00:30:57,083
With detective Scanlon tomorrow.

649
00:30:57,151 --> 00:30:59,753
If you get this,
can you call me in the morning?

651
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:02,055
I don't understand

652
00:31:02,123 --> 00:31:04,057
Why this guy won't call
either one of us back.

653
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:07,027
Maybe he's afraid to confront
the guy who shot him.

654
00:31:07,094 --> 00:31:08,295
I don't know.

655
00:31:08,362 --> 00:31:11,064
When the doctors told Neal
that he was paralyzed,

656
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:12,666
He basically just ignored them.

657
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:13,834
He doesn't really strike me

658
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:18,171
As the kind of guy
who's short on courage.

659
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:19,573
What are you reading so intently?

660
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,075
I thought you didn't have to do
any work with your new job.

661
00:31:22,143 --> 00:31:24,911
I don't. But I did.

662
00:31:24,979 --> 00:31:28,014
I took your advice, and I tried
to show him what I got.

663
00:31:28,082 --> 00:31:29,783
Unfortunately, when he saw it,

664
00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:31,384
He couldn't have been less impressed.

665
00:31:31,452 --> 00:31:32,853
So this is my boss's solution

666
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,088
To a problem that I spent
the whole morning working on,

667
00:31:35,156 --> 00:31:37,290
And he dashed it off while
eating a tuna sandwich.

668
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:39,726
Read through it four times
now, and you know what?

669
00:31:39,794 --> 00:31:41,294
It's better than what I came up with.

670
00:31:41,362 --> 00:31:43,096
Way better.

671
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:46,399
I can see why the company
puts up with this guy's quirks.

672
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:49,035
You know, it's a shame
that this much talent

673
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:51,104
Is attached to a guy
with zero people skills.

674
00:31:51,172 --> 00:31:54,474
Well... It's a shame,

675
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:56,476
But at least it won't be
your problem anymore.

676
00:31:56,544 --> 00:31:58,044
That's right 'cause I'm gonna do

677
00:31:58,112 --> 00:31:59,179
Some really interesting
thing with turbines.

679
00:32:00,848 --> 00:32:04,284
<i>Authorities have cracked
the coded message</i>

680
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,286
That was left with the latest victim

681
00:32:06,354 --> 00:32:09,122
Of the so-called libra slayer,
though apparently the note

682
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,690
Has given them no further clues

683
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:13,093
To the identity of the murderer.

684
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,529
And in other news,
president bill clinton today vowed

685
00:32:15,596 --> 00:32:16,763
To fight impeachment char...

686
00:32:28,976 --> 00:32:30,644
Car keys and your wallet now!

687
00:32:31,846 --> 00:32:34,014
Come on.
Give me your wallet!

688
00:32:35,082 --> 00:32:36,483
Give me your wallet right now.

690
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,819
Now your keys. Let's go.

691
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:40,921
Let's go!

692
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:42,355
Man, let me... Let me have my car.

693
00:32:42,423 --> 00:32:44,357
I just need to get to work and,
you know...

694
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:46,459
If you don't give me those keys,

695
00:32:46,527 --> 00:32:48,428
You're not going to need
anything ever again.

699
00:33:31,457 --> 00:33:32,558
So wait a second.
You're telling me

700
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:33,992
That guy that limped
in here the other day

701
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,563
With the cane... Was the libra slayer?

702
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,431
Neal Greybridge, yes, it's him.

703
00:33:40,499 --> 00:33:42,600
Really? 'cause that guy
can barely get around.

704
00:33:42,668 --> 00:33:44,068
How does it work?

705
00:33:44,136 --> 00:33:47,038
Does he park in a handicapped
spot before he kills someone?

706
00:33:47,106 --> 00:33:49,774
I'm telling you it's him, Lee.
I saw it.

707
00:33:49,842 --> 00:33:51,976
The original killings stopped
11 years ago

708
00:33:52,044 --> 00:33:53,111
Right after Neal got shot.

709
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:54,312
They started again

710
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,681
As soon as he was well enough
to get around.

711
00:33:56,749 --> 00:33:58,116
And you want to know why

712
00:33:58,183 --> 00:33:59,250
The killer's suddenly
left-handed?

713
00:34:00,553 --> 00:34:01,786
'cause he can't use his right hand.

714
00:34:01,854 --> 00:34:03,655
He's got a bullet lodged in his spine.

715
00:34:03,722 --> 00:34:06,457
That sure would explain a lot of things.

716
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:07,559
Like the handprint.

717
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:08,826
What handprint?

718
00:34:08,894 --> 00:34:11,262
11 years go, the original
detectives on the case

719
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,831
Discovered a partial handprint
on one of the letters

720
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:15,333
That the libra slayer left behind.

721
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:17,268
They were sure that was
the piece of evidence

722
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:18,336
That was gonna help them

723
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:19,938
Put john david boatner away.

724
00:34:20,005 --> 00:34:21,306
The only problem was

725
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:24,342
It didn't match.
It wasn't his print.

726
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:27,879
Bring Neal Greybridge in.
Take his print.

727
00:34:27,947 --> 00:34:31,249
If I'm wrong,
you'll have lost a couple hours.

728
00:34:31,317 --> 00:34:36,020
If I'm right... 
Maybe this whole thing will be over.

730
00:34:37,923 --> 00:34:39,691
Keith, you got a minute?

731
00:34:39,758 --> 00:34:41,459
Actually, I don't.

732
00:34:41,527 --> 00:34:42,860
Just one minute.

733
00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:45,763
Promise. I just want to talk
to you about that transfer.

734
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:47,398
What about it?

735
00:34:47,466 --> 00:34:49,033
It's just gonna take a couple days

736
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:50,668
To get through human resources.

737
00:34:50,736 --> 00:34:52,670
I know that. Thing is,
I don't want it.

738
00:34:54,673 --> 00:34:56,274
Really?

739
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:58,309
I knew it.

740
00:34:58,377 --> 00:35:04,082
Suddenly, you realize the idea
of a couple years of free money

741
00:35:04,149 --> 00:35:05,650
Isn't so heinous, huh?

742
00:35:05,718 --> 00:35:08,086
No, actually, it wasn't that.

743
00:35:08,153 --> 00:35:09,654
I read your notes.

744
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:13,558
Your solution to the wiring
problem... it's smart.

745
00:35:13,626 --> 00:35:15,627
Scary smart.

746
00:35:15,694 --> 00:35:19,263
Oh, well, that's...

747
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:22,300
Okay... Thanks.

748
00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:23,701
You're welcome.
Thing is, I don't want

749
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:25,336
To transfer away
from that kind of thinking.

750
00:35:25,404 --> 00:35:26,738
No good engineer would.

751
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:29,707
Yeah, well...

752
00:35:29,775 --> 00:35:33,144
This isn't really about what you want.

753
00:35:33,212 --> 00:35:35,647
I'm not so sure.

754
00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:38,182
See, you need my help, man.

755
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,385
You don't know it yet,
but you need my help.

756
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:41,919
You're clearly brilliant.

757
00:35:41,987 --> 00:35:44,188
You're brilliant enough to get
away with this howard hughes act

758
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,657
Up until now.

759
00:35:45,724 --> 00:35:48,092
But I guarantee you
you're gonna get caught

760
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,994
'cause you're not doing
your best work.

761
00:35:50,062 --> 00:35:51,663
Nobody does their best work
in a vacuum.

762
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,765
Now, you need someone
to bounce your ideas off,

763
00:35:53,832 --> 00:35:56,200
Somebody to check your thinking against.

764
00:35:56,268 --> 00:35:58,269
Somebody who's smart enough
to keep pace with you

765
00:35:58,337 --> 00:36:00,772
And someone who's gonna call you
on your crap.

766
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,540
I think I'm that guy.

767
00:36:02,608 --> 00:36:05,943
So think about it.

768
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:08,379
If you agree, call off the transfer.

769
00:36:08,447 --> 00:36:11,749
By the way, you're gonna want
to check your work

770
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:13,951
On diagram seven, page four.

771
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:16,354
I fixed it for you.

773
00:36:18,624 --> 00:36:20,091
Hello.

774
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,026
I'm in Neal Greybridge's
apartment right now.

775
00:36:22,094 --> 00:36:24,429
<i>You should see his bookshelf:
Cryptanalysis,</i>

776
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:26,497
<i>The codebreakers,
pretty much everything</i>

777
00:36:26,565 --> 00:36:28,499
That's ever been written
on the subject of encryption.

778
00:36:28,567 --> 00:36:29,867
Are you bringing him in?

779
00:36:29,935 --> 00:36:31,202
I'm not bringing him anywhere.

780
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,237
Not right now, anyway. He's gone.

781
00:36:33,305 --> 00:36:35,807
A neighbor told me
she saw Neal packing up his car

782
00:36:35,874 --> 00:36:37,442
And driving off in a hurry.

783
00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:39,310
This was the day before yesterday.

784
00:36:39,378 --> 00:36:42,046
So,something must have spooked him.

785
00:36:42,114 --> 00:36:44,816
Oh, my god, Lee, I scared him off.

786
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:46,918
I told him that I'd been
dreaming about him.

787
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:48,619
I even found the man who'd shot him.

788
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:51,089
He must have figured
it was just a matter of time

789
00:36:51,156 --> 00:36:52,857
Before I learned the truth about him.

790
00:36:52,925 --> 00:36:55,259
We should have him in custody right now.

791
00:36:55,327 --> 00:36:56,994
We would have him in custody right now

792
00:36:57,062 --> 00:36:58,696
If I'd just seen it sooner.

793
00:36:58,764 --> 00:36:59,997
We'll find him, Allison.

794
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:01,632
It's just a matter of time.

795
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,401
I'm not sure we have time.

796
00:37:03,469 --> 00:37:06,504
Neal spent the last 11 years
of his life working his way

797
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:07,538
Out of a hospital bed.

798
00:37:07,606 --> 00:37:08,873
Getting himself strong enough

799
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:10,875
To do the one thing
that he really loves.

800
00:37:10,943 --> 00:37:12,910
Now that he's back,
I don't think he's going

801
00:37:12,978 --> 00:37:14,545
To stop killing women

802
00:37:14,613 --> 00:37:16,347
Just because the police
know who he is.

810
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:21,679
You okay?

811
00:38:23,015 --> 00:38:24,315
Al?

812
00:38:24,383 --> 00:38:26,918
Wait. Shh. I got to get this down.

813
00:38:31,857 --> 00:38:33,024
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

814
00:38:34,493 --> 00:38:37,595
I'll be waiting by the phone.

815
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:38,729
Devalos got the fax.

816
00:38:40,566 --> 00:38:41,799
I told him what I know.

817
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:43,668
Neal Greybridge is
going to leave that note

818
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:45,303
At the scene of the next murder.

819
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,171
The police are trying
to decode it now.

820
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,673
That's good news, right?

821
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,842
In your dream, the murder took place

822
00:38:50,909 --> 00:38:54,745
At 5:30 in the morning.
Now it's exactly 1:51.

823
00:38:54,813 --> 00:38:56,914
So that gives the police
over three and a half hours

824
00:38:56,982 --> 00:38:58,182
To try and break this thing.

825
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,484
Yeah, well,
it took the police ten hours

826
00:39:00,552 --> 00:39:01,686
to decode the last letter,

827
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:04,055
so the girl will be dead by then.

828
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:06,824
It's right here.
It's right here in front of me.

829
00:39:06,892 --> 00:39:08,459
Every one of his messages contains

830
00:39:08,527 --> 00:39:09,760
the name of the victim.

831
00:39:09,828 --> 00:39:12,597
He stalks them; he notes
their surroundings.

832
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:14,365
He documents everything.

833
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:16,033
If we could just read this,

834
00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:17,668
We would know exactly
who he's gonna kill,

835
00:39:17,736 --> 00:39:19,570
Exactly how he's gonna do it.

836
00:39:24,343 --> 00:39:25,943
Wait a minute.

837
00:39:26,011 --> 00:39:27,645
I know this.

838
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:29,380
I know I know this.

839
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:31,816
What are you doing?

840
00:39:31,884 --> 00:39:34,085
It's right here.

841
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:36,721
I had it right here
the whole time.

842
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:38,589
What are you talking about?
You had what?

843
00:39:38,657 --> 00:39:40,625
This.

844
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:49,400
Isn't that the note that you wrote

845
00:39:49,468 --> 00:39:50,635
To Marie's teacher?

846
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:53,971
I need a pen.

847
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:55,673
Thanks.

848
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:56,974
This is the answer key.

849
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:59,210
"Dear mrs. Cezaux..."

850
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,146
The police arrested him

851
00:40:02,214 --> 00:40:04,515
early this morning
in San Bernardino,California.

852
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,350
He was trying to break into the home

853
00:40:06,418 --> 00:40:07,618
Of the woman you dreamt about.

854
00:40:07,686 --> 00:40:10,154
As a matter of fact,
mr. Greybridge told us

855
00:40:10,222 --> 00:40:12,456
He was willing to make
a full confession.

856
00:40:12,524 --> 00:40:13,891
There's only one condition:

857
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:16,193
Before he'll issue his statement,

858
00:40:16,261 --> 00:40:18,429
He wants to talk to you.

859
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:30,141
When I was in rehab,

860
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,475
They called me

861
00:40:31,543 --> 00:40:39,617
"a textbook example of courage,
willpower."

862
00:40:39,685 --> 00:40:46,390
Nobody could believe that a man
like Neal Greybridge...

863
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:49,493
Quiet little Neal Greybridge...

864
00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:53,497
Could look a medical
impossibility in the face,

865
00:40:53,565 --> 00:40:57,668
And then step on its throat.

866
00:41:00,572 --> 00:41:01,872
Of course, what they didn't understand

867
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,909
Was that Neal Greybridge

868
00:41:04,977 --> 00:41:09,146
Couldn't even make it
out of his hospital bed.

869
00:41:11,717 --> 00:41:16,821
Hmm. It takes an incredible
sense of purpose

870
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:19,757
To achieve a miracle like that.

871
00:41:19,825 --> 00:41:23,260
And the part that I showed the world,

872
00:41:23,328 --> 00:41:30,768
The part that everybody knew
as "Neal Greybridge"...

873
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:33,004
He didn't have that sense of purpose.

874
00:41:36,508 --> 00:41:44,682
The man that had the strength
and the courage

875
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:50,454
To... Get out of bed
and walk again...

876
00:41:52,824 --> 00:41:57,628
That man is a part that I kept secret.

877
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:03,734
It's a part that still had work to do.

878
00:42:03,802 --> 00:42:06,504
It's a part that had to get out of bed

879
00:42:06,571 --> 00:42:11,175
And had to stand again and walk again.

880
00:42:12,611 --> 00:42:14,645
If you say so.

881
00:42:16,615 --> 00:42:18,983
Why are you telling me this?

882
00:42:19,051 --> 00:42:25,289
Because you are the only person

883
00:42:25,357 --> 00:42:27,725
That's ever actually
seen that part of me

884
00:42:27,793 --> 00:42:29,760
And lived.

885
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:39,236
Now that you know everything
about me, I'm curious.

886
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,342
Do you see me
the same way that I see myself?

887
00:42:46,812 --> 00:42:49,880
I see an egoist...

888
00:42:51,683 --> 00:42:53,317
Self-centered, self-involved...

889
00:42:55,921 --> 00:42:57,588
A murderer...

890
00:42:59,191 --> 00:43:01,725
Cowardly murderer...

891
00:43:01,793 --> 00:43:03,861
A waste.

892
00:43:06,398 --> 00:43:08,265
Will there be anything else?
