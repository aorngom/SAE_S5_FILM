1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:02,623
A tisket, a tasket

2
00:00:02,694 --> 00:00:05,485
A green and yellow basket

3
00:00:05,593 --> 00:00:08,621
I wrote a letter to my love

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:11,133
And on the way I dropped it

5
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:13,908
I dropped it, I dropped it

6
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:16,831
And on the way I dropped it

7
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:19,662
A little boy picked it up

8
00:00:19,718 --> 00:00:22,571
and put it in his pocket

9
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:25,360
A tisket, a tasket

10
00:00:25,473 --> 00:00:28,145
A green and yellow basket

11
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:30,700
I wrote a letter to...

12
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,233
Bridge? Come on, I'm begging you. Open the door.

13
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:02,224
- You have school.
- No! I hate school.

14
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:07,790
Yeah, well, I like school and I still have to get dressed! Unlock the door, you little freak!

15
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,063
- Ariel!
- Hey, what's all the racket?

16
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:10,539
Mom, I want my own room!

17
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:12,448
Bridgette, you know you're not supposed to lock the door.

18
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:14,875
And I want my own private island and a private jet to take me there...

19
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:17,952
- Bridgette, answer me!
- ...and cook and a houseboy to pamper me when I arrive.

20
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:19,867
- It's good to want things.
- Bridgette?

21
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:21,547
She's okay.

22
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:25,008
Honey, you've got clean clothes folded in the laundry basket.

23
00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:26,329
Go get dressed in my room.

24
00:03:26,877 --> 00:03:28,295
Freakazoid!

25
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:30,999
I'll take care of this.

26
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:32,884
Where you going?

27
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,657
Mommy, what are you doing out there?

28
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:54,347
I came to talk to you.

29
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,893
Are you in your underwear?

30
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:01,832
Aren't you worried someone might see?

31
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:04,786
A little. But I'm more worried about you.

32
00:04:04,873 --> 00:04:06,941
Don't worried about me. I'm fine.

33
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:09,917
I'm just going to stay in my room for the rest of my life.

34
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:13,244
Oh... okay.

35
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,953
Well, what do I tell your teacher?

36
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:20,541
Daddy and I are supposed to meet with her this morning.

37
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,097
I don't know.

38
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:25,819
Tell her that... that I hate school.

39
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:27,872
Okay, I'll tell her.

40
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:30,760
And you're just going to stay in there?

41
00:04:31,497 --> 00:04:34,022
Even though Mommy and Daddy have to go to work

42
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:36,239
and you'll be all alone in the house?

43
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,955
You're okay with that?

44
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:44,031
I would be scared to be all alone in the house without you.

45
00:04:44,154 --> 00:04:47,159
But if you're okay with that, I'll see you after work.

46
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:55,101
Mom!!

47
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:58,081
Yeah?

48
00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:00,657
Maybe I'll stay in my room for the rest of my life

49
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:03,897
on a day when you don't have to go to work.

50
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,412
Mm, okay. That makes sense.

51
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:07,619
Tell you what.

52
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:11,889
You go unlock the door and I'll come around and meet you and we'll have some breakfast, okay?

53
00:05:12,003 --> 00:05:13,794
- Okay.
- Okay. Go.

54
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:16,810
She's smart as a whip.

55
00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:20,558
I actually think, in some ways, that may be part of the problem.

56
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,127
I'm sorry. I guess we didn't know there was a problem.

57
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,076
Not academically. Academically, she's stellar.

58
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:30,316
But I am concerned with how she's doing socially.

59
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:33,684
Working in groups. Playing with others. That sort of thing.

60
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:36,945
She seems to have a hard time with it.

61
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:37,910
Really?

62
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,707
Mm-hmm. I've noticed she spends a lot of time alone, playing by herself.

63
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:45,108
Is she like that at home?

64
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:48,846
Yeah.

65
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:53,182
She has a very active imagination. But that isn't bad, is it?

66
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:55,455
No. Not necessarily,

67
00:05:55,942 --> 00:06:00,832
but... if a child is lonely, if they feel separate and apart...

68
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:05,900
it becomes difficult for them to enjoy coming to class, being with others.

69
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,643
So, I'm worried because she doesn't seem to have many friends.

70
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:15,060
To be perfectly honest, she doesn't seem to have any friends.

71
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,961
The other kids-- they avoid her.

72
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,871
I should've seen it. I should've realized.

73
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:24,758
I mean, I've always known that she was... unique.

74
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:27,231
I just... No friends?

75
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:31,701
With Ariel, it was so easy. She was somebody everybody always wanted to play with.

76
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:34,629
All I had to do was sit back and wait for the phone to ring.

77
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:35,971
This is my fault.

78
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,185
I should've been out there, making play dates, arranging sleepovers.

79
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:42,837
Wait a second. It's not like it's too late. She's in first grade, for goodness sake!

80
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:46,323
You're right. You're right.

81
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:48,852
I'll make some calls as soon as I get home.

82
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:51,858
Call some of the other mothers. Maybe set something up for this weekend.

83
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:55,223
Wait, wait!

84
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:59,764
I have to go into the D.A.'s today. I got to drop Marie off at day care.

85
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,370
Maybe this was not the greatest moment to go back to work.

86
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:04,617
Hold on. Can we not blow this out of proportion?

87
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,315
We have a problem. We have a plan to solve it.

88
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:09,841
You'll make the calls tonight instead of an hour from now.

89
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,028
End of crisis.

90
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:14,048
- What if I have to work late?
- Then I'll make some calls.

91
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:17,817
We're talking about helping our six-year-old make friends, not curing cancer.

92
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,747
We can do this.

93
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:21,897
She's a good kid.

94
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,837
The lady said "smart as a whip," did she not?

95
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:26,383
Hey.

96
00:07:26,956 --> 00:07:28,211
Consider the gene pool.

97
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:33,173
And you be sure and tell my esteemed colleague that confession or no confession,

98
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:38,190
if I don't have his client's affidavit on my desk by 5:00 this afternoon, I'm pulling the offer.

99
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:41,309
- You're here?
- I have been for over an hour.

100
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:44,477
Boy, I told my assistant to call your house first thing this morning.

101
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:46,014
- I had a thing at school.
- And she didn't try your cell?

102
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:46,863
No.

103
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,555
- And you couldn't just sense...?
- Apparently not.

104
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:54,350
- So, basically, I'm here for nothing?
- No, not for nothing.

105
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:55,962
I mean, you'll be paid.

106
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:58,778
You know what? You're right.

107
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,585
Since you're here, since you're getting paid...

108
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:02,152
You know, I don't need a mercy job.

109
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,854
Hey, I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this for me.

110
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:08,005
All I need to do is run for reelection and have someone find out I paid you

111
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:10,579
and you didn't do anything to earn it. Are these the CCFs?

112
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:11,449
Yes, sir.

113
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,736
All right, now, all I need is a place to put you.

114
00:08:21,204 --> 00:08:22,408
Don't thank me now.

115
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:23,954
You spoil me.

116
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,418
Oh, it's not as bad as it looks. Old Wayne over there swears to me he actually likes it!

117
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:30,831
Old Wayne? Sounds like something I used to drink.

118
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:33,702
Criminal sketch artist. You'll be sharing this space with him.

119
00:08:35,212 --> 00:08:38,930
And what exactly is it you would have me do in this sumptuous space?

120
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:40,624
You ever heard of "Cold Case Files"?

121
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:42,600
Yeah, but I never watched it.

122
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:45,125
No, not the television show. These are the real thing.

123
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:47,671
They're cases that are cold. Mysteries that are unsolved.

124
00:08:47,742 --> 00:08:50,455
Unsolved Mysteries. Never saw that either.

125
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:53,901
What I'd like you to do is spend a little bit of time looking at each one of these files.

126
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:57,091
- See if you get some sort of vibration off of it.
- Ooh, "vibration"?

127
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,987
Whatever it is you get, when you get, whatever it is you get.

128
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,901
- Got it.
- Good. I'll be in my office.

129
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:04,939
That would be that room with all the windows?

130
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:06,241
Right you are.

131
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,377
All right, let's get started.

132
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:28,457
I'll try, but like I was telling the officers, it's not like I got a really good look at him.

133
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:32,077
It was dark, and I was hiding from him. And then I was running from him.

134
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:34,697
It's all right. Just do the best you can do.

135
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:39,198
Let's start with something easy. Let's start with, uh, hair color.

136
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:42,433
According to the investigating officer's police report,

137
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:45,788
you said the perpetrator had blond hair?

138
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:48,752
Yeah. Brownish blond. I think so.

139
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:49,986
You think so?

140
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:51,963
No. That's it. Definitely.

141
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:53,652
Brownish blond.

142
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:55,397
And short.

143
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,823
So we're talking about a Caucasian?

144
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:00,246
You mean a white man?

145
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:02,797
Yeah, he was a white man.

146
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,781
What about his stature?

147
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:10,400
Are we talking tall man, short man, fat man, thin man?

148
00:10:11,552 --> 00:10:12,524
It's okay.

149
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,301
Just relax and concentrate on what happened.

150
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:21,648
Mister... he killed my fiancé right in front of me.

151
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:25,462
My clothes have pieces of his brain on them.

152
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:29,098
You relax and concentrate.

153
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:31,744
Miss, uh...

154
00:11:09,608 --> 00:11:12,654
He was a short man, really.

155
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:13,724
Average to short.

156
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:17,504
Just a white guy.

157
00:11:18,993 --> 00:11:21,107
An average to short white guy.

158
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:25,332
Okay. What else can you remember?

159
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:28,102
Eyes, maybe? Eye color?

160
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,851
Did he have all of his teeth?

161
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:34,303
What about his ears? Were they especially large?

162
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:37,537
Just... take your time.

163
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:42,151
Let me think...

164
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:01,567
I'd have to say he looked like a farm boy to me.

165
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:06,830
You know, like one of those Midwestern-looking types...

166
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:09,989
with nice teeth and short hair.

167
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:17,798
It's all coming back to me now.

168
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:29,480
Anyway, my wife and I thought it might be fun for our girls to get together outside of school.

169
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:31,873
Bridgette, yeah.

170
00:12:32,624 --> 00:12:34,924
Great. Let's see, uh...

171
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,786
Um, how about... Sorry?

172
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:42,501
No, no, actually, Bridgette doesn't have an online calendar.

173
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,602
Does sound like a time saver. We'll look into it.

174
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:48,553
Oh, so how about Saturday?

175
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,995
She has horseback riding till noon? Huh.

176
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,355
Um, then, book club... right. Ah, what about Sunday?

177
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:01,257
A fund-raiser?

178
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:05,976
Wow, I didn't know that six-year-olds did...

179
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:12,950
No. I can definitely see how that would help flesh out a high school transcript. Sure.

180
00:13:13,857 --> 00:13:15,899
Uh... what about the next weekend?

181
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,473
You can pencil her in?

182
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,632
Yeah, okay, sure.

183
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:25,018
No, no, it's Dubois.

184
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:28,198
Uh, that's a different Bridgette.

185
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:32,324
Sure, yeah.

186
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:34,588
Probably should talk to Cassie first.

187
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:38,132
Well, yeah, call me if she's interested.

188
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,918
You, too.

189
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,658
Bye.

190
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:47,705
Everyone brush your teeth?

191
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:58,422
Ah, my prayers have been answered.

192
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:00,997
A woman sneaking into my room.

193
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:05,169
And wonder of wonders, she actually looks like my wife.

194
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,156
The better to ease the guilt.

195
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:09,537
God is good.

196
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,944
You missed some amazing franks and some even better beans.

197
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:17,632
We waited at the table for you to show up.

198
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:20,750
We waited for, I don't know, three hours?

199
00:14:21,508 --> 00:14:25,142
But by then the flies were getting so thick, the kids started to complain,

200
00:14:25,224 --> 00:14:28,670
and it was like, oh, heck, let's just eat without Mommy.

201
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,188
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:49,601
I've been looking at mug shot books for the last five hours.

203
00:14:50,082 --> 00:14:53,760
This witness, this woman was caught up in this...

204
00:14:55,156 --> 00:14:56,375
execution.

205
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:59,873
Her fiancé was murdered right in front of her.

206
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:04,399
And she's giving this description to the police of the perpetrator.

207
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,502
And I'm listening and I'm realizing

208
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:10,999
the man she's describing is not the man inside her head.

209
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:11,812
Al...

210
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,731
And I can't very well go to the sketch artist and say, um, "I read her mind.

211
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,414
Draw a guy who looks like this."

212
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:23,446
So, I looked through all the mug shot books, hoping...

213
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:26,558
And then I looked up and it's 10:30.

214
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:29,974
And now the police are looking for the wrong guy.

215
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:32,345
She's probably scared, Al.

216
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:35,095
I know, but I gotta think of something.

217
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,530
You want to hear some good news?

218
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,402
Bridgette made a friend.

219
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:47,807
- No.
- Yeah. Talk about timing, huh?

220
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,434
Oh, she came home from school all excited.

221
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:53,343
They played on the playground. They ate lunch together.

222
00:15:53,496 --> 00:15:55,421
She can't wait to go to school tomorrow.

223
00:15:55,544 --> 00:15:58,217
Oh, God, that's great! And I wasn't here.

224
00:15:58,298 --> 00:16:01,079
It's okay. She'll tell you all about him in the morning.

225
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:02,999
Yeah, it's a him?

226
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:03,972
Bobby!

227
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,706
Bobby. Bobby who?

228
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:11,257
We don't have a last name yet, but she promised to get it and a phone number tomorrow.

229
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,185
With any luck, he'll still have some openings in the fourth quarter of his fiscal year.

230
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:17,574
Mm, this is great.

231
00:16:18,486 --> 00:16:20,980
Maybe I'll see him tomorrow when I drop her off at school.

232
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:22,229
I'm sure you will.

233
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:25,235
Now may I have a kiss?

234
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:27,949
- What?
- A kiss.

235
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:31,718
That thing we used to do when we saw each other after a long day.

236
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:35,122
I like Bobby.

237
00:16:38,037 --> 00:16:39,792
It sounds nice.

238
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:41,461
He sounds nice.

239
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:42,956
You can't have him.

240
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,341
He's already involved with your daughter.

241
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:48,746
And, besides, you're already involved with me.

242
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:11,659
It's not even 7:30. Why are we so early?

243
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,633
Because I have to work today. Besides it's only a few minutes.

244
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,782
More like 20. What are we supposed to do for 20 whole entire minutes?

245
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:20,859
I don't know. Look, kids are playing in the playground!

246
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:22,932
Uh, little kids.

247
00:17:23,117 --> 00:17:26,706
I'm sure you'll think of something. And don't forget, Dad is picking you up today.

248
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,030
- How come?
- Because I have a big day at work,

249
00:17:29,106 --> 00:17:32,881
and he's gonna bring home things he can do there, so try not to make too much noise.

250
00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:33,992
Okay.

251
00:17:34,883 --> 00:17:36,332
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, lips.

252
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:38,135
Where's my kiss?

253
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:39,215
Bye.

254
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,476
Bye, Mom.

255
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,161
Bye, wild thing.

256
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,720
Wow. You are really good.

257
00:18:19,674 --> 00:18:22,842
Hi. Um, I'm sitting over there temporarily.

258
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,351
Allison. I think we missed each other the other day.

259
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:26,231
Wayne.

260
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,499
It's amazing you can do that.

261
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:34,352
I been at it a long time.

262
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,617
What do you do?

263
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:40,250
Oh, I'm a consultant. I work part-time with the D.A. It's pretty boring.

264
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:42,959
Could I ask you kind of a nutty question?

265
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:47,546
- What's that?
- Do you ever, like, draw for money?

266
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:50,261
What, you mean like ads or something?

267
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:53,976
I have this idea-- I don't mean to put you on the spot--

268
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:56,137
but it's my husband's birthday tomorrow.

269
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,134
And he's one of those people who's impossible to shop for.

270
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:00,720
Could I give you a...?

271
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:04,003
You have a picture or something, like maybe a photo from your wallet?

272
00:19:04,248 --> 00:19:04,971
No.

273
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:08,661
I was hoping maybe I could describe him to you...

274
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:11,902
All right.

275
00:19:16,193 --> 00:19:20,709
Okay. Let's start with his, um... complexion.

276
00:19:21,052 --> 00:19:22,460
How would you describe that?

277
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:26,151
Well, it's very similar to yours actually.

278
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:30,544
Let me see if I've got this straight.

279
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:33,893
This is the man we should be looking for, not this man?

280
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:36,458
Then who do you suppose this is?

281
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,229
I think it's Matt Damon.

282
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:42,249
I left a magazine laying around and I think the witness saw it and...

283
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:43,722
Oh, for crying out loud.

284
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:49,259
Okay, let's say you're right. Let's say the witness lied and her sketch is bogus.

285
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:52,592
Well, she's not lying exactly. She's just afraid of being involved.

286
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:55,214
Allison, that's lying. Exactly.

287
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:58,438
Besides, whatever her reasons are, my hands are really tied.

288
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,458
What do you mean?

289
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:01,900
Well, what would you have me do with this?

290
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,421
I don t know. Publish it. Distribute it. Go get the cops to go get the guy.

291
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:09,200
Allison, I can't put this out. Where would I say it came from?

292
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:12,463
An anonymous eyewitness.

293
00:20:12,615 --> 00:20:14,080
Oh, right.

294
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:17,649
The description from the person in the room-- that's the one I tell the police to ignore.

295
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,269
And the description from someone whose identity I can't discuss--

296
00:20:20,357 --> 00:20:22,400
- that's the one I want them to pay attention to.
- But...

297
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:25,932
Then what? What happens if we manage to find the guy and make an arrest?

298
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,140
What happens when the defense attorney puts you on the stand?

299
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:29,072
What do you say?

300
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,719
Better yet, what happens when he puts the woman on the stand and she says,

301
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,675
"That's not the man I described"?

302
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:35,457
I don't know.

303
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:39,476
All I know is, you're looking for the wrong man.

304
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:41,293
Well, maybe you're right.

305
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:45,024
But if this is the real man we should be looking for,

306
00:20:45,516 --> 00:20:48,257
then we need to get the real eyewitness to say so.

307
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:04,360
- I got a C-plus on my math test.
- C-plus? All right.

308
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:05,885
That's progress.

309
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:07,231
Where's your sister?

310
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:10,559
- Playground, probably.
- Come on, let's go find her.

311
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:19,790
You're it! You can't catch me.

312
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:26,007
You can't touch me.

313
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,266
Bridgette!

314
00:21:37,368 --> 00:21:40,328
God. Why does she have to be so weird all the time?

315
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:54,402
It doesn't sound like that big a deal. So she was playing by herself.

316
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:57,219
Did you ask her what happened to Bobby?

317
00:21:57,602 --> 00:22:01,151
Maybe he went home sick, or maybe he was playing with some little boys.

318
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:05,119
That doesn't mean that he doesn't want to play with her anymore.

319
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:06,071
I'm just saying...

320
00:22:06,218 --> 00:22:09,507
Bridgette, did you get to ask Bobby what his last name was?

321
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:12,793
It's Lechelle. Bobby Lechelle.

322
00:22:13,187 --> 00:22:14,452
Let's see.

323
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,667
Oh. Perfect. There's only one Lechelle.

324
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:19,819
Call!

325
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:21,068
Why don't you call?

326
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:22,972
- You're a big girl.
- Okay.

327
00:22:25,114 --> 00:22:30,595
Okay, I'll read you the numbers. Ready? 5-5-5-0-1-9-6.

328
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:37,380
It's ringing.

329
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:43,681
Hello? Is Bobby home? This is Bridgette.

330
00:22:44,477 --> 00:22:47,176
Bobby! He's my friend.

331
00:22:49,904 --> 00:22:51,649
She wants to talk to you.

332
00:22:52,786 --> 00:22:57,491
Hi, Mrs. Lechelle? This is, uh, Allison Dubois. I'm Bridgette's mom.

333
00:22:58,803 --> 00:23:00,026
No, I don't...

334
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,924
A joke? Of course not.

335
00:23:04,552 --> 00:23:08,168
I'm sorry. I don't understand. You don't have a son at Central?

336
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:13,297
You do?

337
00:23:15,232 --> 00:23:16,241
You did.

338
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:25,754
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:27,342 --> 00:23:29,947
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

340
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:34,033
What was that about?

341
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:41,939
Bridgette, baby, go brush your teeth and get ready for bed. I'll come read you a book.

342
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:47,406
What?

343
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,557
He's dead.

344
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,992
Oh, my, God, what happened?

345
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,690
Five years ago.

346
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,752
He died five years ago.

347
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,609
Do you think she knows?

348
00:24:13,673 --> 00:24:17,580
I doubt it. She probably just thinks he's another kid on the playground.

349
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:22,985
- Well, we have to tell her.
- I guess.

350
00:24:23,406 --> 00:24:24,348
You guess?

351
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:27,123
You don't think this is a problem?

352
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:30,810
We should just be happy that she has a new friend and leave it at that?

353
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:35,131
- We have to do something about this.
- I know.

354
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:37,323
All right, okay, fine, so we're on the same page, then.

355
00:24:41,352 --> 00:24:46,584
Any thoughts as to why who's been dead for five years should choose to hang around our daughter?

356
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:48,356
You make it sound so sinister.

357
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:51,976
He's drawn to her because she can see him, that's all.

358
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:54,644
I don't know if you're aware of this, but right now you sounded almost...

359
00:24:55,156 --> 00:24:57,905
- I don't know, almost proud of her.
- Please.

360
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:02,487
I wouldn't wish the way I see the world on anybody, least of all my own daughter.

361
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:04,945
So what's next, she gonna start finishing my sentences for me?

362
00:25:05,052 --> 00:25:09,073
Start knowing things before they happen, start waking up in a cold sweat from bizarre dreams?

363
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,335
You don't know that any of those things are going to happen.

364
00:25:11,473 --> 00:25:13,050
Well, I'm allowed to wonder.

365
00:25:13,634 --> 00:25:15,247
And I'm allowed to worry.

366
00:25:17,689 --> 00:25:19,543
In fact, I'd be an idiot not to worry.

367
00:25:20,044 --> 00:25:21,938
Got it. Sorry.

368
00:25:23,183 --> 00:25:27,207
- Sorry to have polluted the gene pool.
- Didn't mean it like that.

369
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:28,932
How else could you mean it?

370
00:25:30,453 --> 00:25:32,712
How do you know she's not gonna outgrow it?

371
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:36,945
And just because you see one ghost doesn't mean you see every ghost.

372
00:25:37,063 --> 00:25:37,928
If you say so.

373
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:41,931
Just because you have one dream that seems to come true doesn't mean every dream comes true.

374
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:45,935
I had dream the other night, a wolf was chasing me through the airport trying to kill me.

375
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,451
Didn't mean a damn thing.

376
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:52,080
Although you are looking kind of wolfish.

377
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:53,376
I'm going to check on Bridgette.

378
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:59,940
So it just isn't gonna work out with Bobby this weekend.

379
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,153
How come?

380
00:26:02,618 --> 00:26:04,043
It just isn't.

381
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:06,539
But I was thinking,

382
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:10,450
is there somebody else you like, somebody else at school?

383
00:26:11,752 --> 00:26:14,926
No, Mommy. The other kids are mean.

384
00:26:15,034 --> 00:26:17,138
All the other kids are mean.

385
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:20,337
Bobby is the only one who's nice to me.

386
00:26:20,818 --> 00:26:22,774
What about next weekend?

387
00:26:22,892 --> 00:26:24,864
Can Bobby and me play then?

388
00:26:27,547 --> 00:26:31,909
I don't know, Honey. We'll see tomorrow. It's late, go to sleep.

389
00:26:48,551 --> 00:26:49,286
Ready?

390
00:26:50,346 --> 00:26:52,404
- She's in the conference room.
- Absolutely.

391
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:55,179
This is gonna be a bit tricky.

392
00:26:55,267 --> 00:26:59,931
I have no factual ground on which to question the validity of the sketch she approved.

393
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:03,337
Show her my sketch, see how she reacts to a picture of the real killer.

394
00:27:03,427 --> 00:27:07,667
Love to-- only down the line the defense attorney could say that I influenced the witness.

395
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,346
We can't even show it to her?

396
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,379
I didn't say we; I said I.

397
00:27:16,295 --> 00:27:20,329
Do you remember the affidavit you signed when the sketch artist showed you the finished picture yesterday?

398
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:24,961
The one on which you swear that the description you gave is, to the best of your knowledge, accurate?

399
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:27,928
Well, we lost that affidavit.

400
00:27:28,132 --> 00:27:33,124
I feel terrible about the inconvenience, but I'm afraid that I have to ask you to sign it again.

401
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:45,105
Is this the man you saw shoot your fiancé in cold blood the night of the 12th?

402
00:27:45,571 --> 00:27:46,810
Yeah, that's him.

403
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:48,408
Any changes you'd like to make?

404
00:27:48,508 --> 00:27:49,236
No.

405
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:52,237
Any details that have come back to you since yesterday?

406
00:27:52,954 --> 00:27:54,515
Not really, no.

407
00:27:54,694 --> 00:27:57,592
Are you sure? I'd be happy to bring in the artist you worked with.

408
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,919
If you had any additional thoughts, now would be the time to share them.

409
00:28:02,621 --> 00:28:06,625
No. I'm very happy with the sketch. If you'll let me just sign the paper...

410
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:10,799
Allison...

411
00:28:16,817 --> 00:28:18,026
Oh, my goodness.

412
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:20,291
Here you go.

413
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,102
Thank you.

414
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:31,821
- Thank you.
- Allison.

415
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,656
Is there anything else, or can I go?

416
00:28:35,944 --> 00:28:39,510
Yeah... you could take another look.

417
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:42,531
- Excuse me?
- Isn't this the man that killed your fiancé?

418
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:45,045
I don't understand what's going on here-- I signed your paper.

419
00:28:45,164 --> 00:28:46,833
I'm sorry, you're free to leave at any time.

420
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:50,872
Listen, I know you're afraid, but if you don't help us, he may very well kill somebody else.

421
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:52,685
I am helping you-- I'm here, aren't I?

422
00:28:52,782 --> 00:28:57,261
- Without you making an accurate identification... 
- I did make an accurate identification.

423
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:03,866
There is no one on this planet that wants to see that man behind bars more than me.

424
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:08,094
There is no one more frightened of seeing that man again than me.

425
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,486
I've done all that I can.

426
00:29:12,003 --> 00:29:13,498
Have you caught him yet?

427
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:17,015
Do you even know his name? Do you even know where he lives?

428
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:22,150
Can you promise me that he isn't in the parking lot waiting for me right now?

429
00:29:27,219 --> 00:29:28,628
I didn't think so.

430
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:34,976
So, if he kills again, it won't be my fault, now, will it?

431
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,773
- Is not!
- Is so!

432
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,545
- Is not!
- Is so!

433
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,747
- Is not!
- Is so!

434
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,954
- Is not!
- Is so!

435
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,957
- Hey, hey, hey...
- Is not!

436
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,595
Mom, tell her-- tell there is no best friend! There is no play date! There is no Bobby!

437
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:02,829
Ariel, enough.

438
00:30:03,664 --> 00:30:06,040
- Joe...
- Is so a Bobby!

439
00:30:07,728 --> 00:30:09,152
Stop it, girls.

440
00:30:10,704 --> 00:30:12,721
Stop it...!

441
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:17,806
Stop. Ariel, go to your room now. Do your homework. Now!

442
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:19,417
Bridgette, go.

443
00:30:19,678 --> 00:30:21,425
Get your coat. You're coming with me.

444
00:30:21,646 --> 00:30:23,192
Where are you taking me?

445
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:24,600
To jail?

446
00:30:25,695 --> 00:30:27,625
Just... get your coat.

447
00:30:29,438 --> 00:30:30,698
What's your plan, Stan?

448
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:33,846
I don't know.

449
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:38,113
I figure if Bobby's gonna be her best friend, then I should go have a chat with him.

450
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:40,102
Bridgette?

451
00:30:40,814 --> 00:30:41,609
Bridgette?

452
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:43,466
Move it.

453
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,947
I don't see him. Do you?

454
00:31:04,152 --> 00:31:08,549
Of course not, Mommy. It's night. He's probably at home, in bed, asleep.

455
00:31:10,357 --> 00:31:12,359
That's the thing, honey. He isn't.

456
00:31:12,554 --> 00:31:13,731
He never sleeps.

457
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:15,713
He's afraid to.

458
00:31:15,944 --> 00:31:19,671
He's afraid if he allows himself to sleep, he'll wake up somewhere far, far away

459
00:31:19,742 --> 00:31:23,055
and he'll never see you again and he'll never see his parents again.

460
00:31:23,277 --> 00:31:24,273
He's scared.

461
00:31:25,165 --> 00:31:29,009
Well, I'd be scared, too, if I thought I was going far, far away.

462
00:31:29,229 --> 00:31:32,353
But that's the thing, see. When you go to this place...

463
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:37,663
you can actually see everybody. Any time you want, and you're never lonely.

464
00:31:37,888 --> 00:31:39,276
It's a good place.

465
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:41,288
And it's his time.

466
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:44,446
And we have to help him get there.

467
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,696
Hey, Bridgette. Who's that?

468
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,502
Hey, Bobby. This is my mom.

469
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,606
Hi, Bobby.

470
00:32:07,415 --> 00:32:08,346
I know.

471
00:32:08,987 --> 00:32:12,775
It's been a while since a grown-up saw you, spoke to you, right?

472
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,103
I bet you miss your mom.

473
00:32:18,224 --> 00:32:19,985
I know she misses you.

474
00:32:20,641 --> 00:32:23,253
She cries for you. She prays for you.

475
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:26,328
But you can't hear any of that here, can you?

476
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:33,692
You need to be in a place where you can hear everything... see everyone.

477
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,312
There is a place like that, you know.

478
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:40,178
And there are a lot of people waiting for you to show up there.

479
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:42,252
Your grandpa and grandma.

480
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:45,601
Lots of other relatives you've never even met.

481
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,382
It's a wonderful place.

482
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,737
And to get there, all you have to do is to relax.

483
00:32:54,187 --> 00:32:55,544
And let go.

484
00:32:56,722 --> 00:32:58,073
Close your eyes.

485
00:32:59,732 --> 00:33:01,381
Aren't you tired?

486
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:05,416
Come here.

487
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:17,099
But, Mommy... I don't want Bobby to go away.

488
00:33:19,121 --> 00:33:22,327
Where he's going, he will always be with you.

489
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:25,762
In your memories, and in your heart. He will be watching you.

490
00:33:26,492 --> 00:33:31,132
And if you miss him... all you'll need to do is think of him.

491
00:33:32,234 --> 00:33:33,067
Okay?

492
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,066
Okay. Let's go lay down.

493
00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:12,100
It's for you.

494
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:13,539
Who is it?

495
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,234
Oh, I think it's your witness.

496
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:27,280
- Ticket and ID, please.
- I'm not actually flying tonight.

497
00:35:27,363 --> 00:35:29,841
My name's Allison Dubois. I'm with the DA's office.

498
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:32,933
I'm here to secure an affidavit from a witness who's leaving the country.

499
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:35,811
I was told that my office called ahead to let you know I was coming.

500
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:46,522
- I came as quickly as I could.
- Thank you. Thanks for coming.

501
00:35:46,926 --> 00:35:49,697
I feel safe here... you know? They check for guns.

502
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,026
My plane boards in 20 minutes. Let's just get this over with.

503
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:58,206
That is the man, isn't it?

504
00:36:00,823 --> 00:36:05,411
Just so we're clear... I'm not coming back to testify until you've got him locked up.

505
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,018
Till you've got him where he can't hurt me.

506
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:08,579
Everybody understands.

507
00:36:13,086 --> 00:36:15,661
I know you think I'm crazy, running way like this.

508
00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:17,002
I know what happened...

509
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:22,127
I mean, I wasn't there, but I read your statement.

510
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:23,129
He knows me.

511
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,166
He looked right at me.

512
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:36,791
That night, I was supposed to be dead.

513
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:38,306
He meant to kill me.

514
00:36:43,555 --> 00:36:45,086
He means to kill me.

515
00:36:45,613 --> 00:36:48,259
Who is this guy? Do you know him?

516
00:36:48,368 --> 00:36:49,975
I mean... what sort of a criminal is he?

517
00:36:50,106 --> 00:36:52,454
He's the worst kind. He's a cop.

518
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:57,061
I don't know his name or anything, but I know he's an undercover detective in Vice.

519
00:36:57,184 --> 00:37:00,307
My boyfriend told me that nobody moves any kind of narcotic

520
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:02,770
in south Arizona unless he gets a taste of it.

521
00:37:06,622 --> 00:37:08,642
I'm sorry I lied to you.

522
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:10,552
I didn't know what else to do.

523
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,044
A tisket, a tasket

524
00:37:17,203 --> 00:37:19,987
A green and yellow basket

525
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:22,734
I wrote a letter to my love

526
00:37:27,598 --> 00:37:29,005
Can't be too careful.

527
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:33,556
Wait a second.

528
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,537
What did you say the detective's name was?

529
00:37:37,504 --> 00:37:40,807
Wolfe. Detective Wolfe. I'm here on official police business.

530
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,977
Hey... did you say Wolfe?

531
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,689
Hey, wait a sec.

532
00:37:47,887 --> 00:37:50,976
You know what? Let me walk you to the gate. I just have this feeling...

533
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:27,605
Police officer! Stop or I'll shoot!

534
00:38:41,382 --> 00:38:43,087
- Don't stop!
- What do you mean?!

535
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:44,178
Just trust me.

536
00:39:05,689 --> 00:39:09,210
An eyewitness to murder and an employee of the District Attorney's office

537
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:11,458
narrowly escaped death here at the airport...

538
00:39:11,544 --> 00:39:15,492
If I don't see some bodies fully dressed and making their way to the car in the next 30 seconds...

539
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,621
...to get the witness's signature on some legal documents.

540
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:21,391
- Unknown to both women, they were being followed...
- Mom... I don't feel good.

541
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,018
You never feel good.

542
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:25,265
In the car, or nobody's going to feel good.

543
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:28,861
...a Phoenix Police detective gave chase and the two women found themselves trapped

544
00:39:28,927 --> 00:39:33,177
at the end of an unoccupied jetway dangling three stories in the air.

545
00:39:33,257 --> 00:39:36,965
- Did anyone remember to shut off the TV?
- Fate and a passing luggage carrier intervened, and...

546
00:39:44,994 --> 00:39:48,107
- Don't forget to give that envelope to Mrs. Cass.
- Okay. Bye.

547
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:49,858
- Bye.
- See you later.

548
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,458
- Bye.
- Bye.

549
00:39:52,185 --> 00:39:56,023
Ding-ding-ding. Last stop. Everybody out.

550
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:59,283
- You lied to me.
- About what?

551
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:01,418
You said he'll always be with me.

552
00:40:02,545 --> 00:40:06,759
He is, honey. He's with you right now, watching out for you.

553
00:40:07,256 --> 00:40:10,374
Well, I don't see him.

554
00:40:10,603 --> 00:40:11,828
Well, he's there.

555
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:14,527
And he's there.

556
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:16,579
And he's there.

557
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:21,217
Now, give Mommy a kiss.

558
00:40:25,498 --> 00:40:27,234
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

559
00:40:27,377 --> 00:40:28,228
See ya.

560
00:40:43,312 --> 00:40:44,734
Whatcha doin'?

561
00:40:46,312 --> 00:40:49,102
We said... whatcha doin'?

562
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,659
Mmm, nothin'.

563
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:52,891
Why aren't you playing with your friend?

564
00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:55,287
He had to go away somewhere...

565
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,825
Okay, I'll tell her.

566
00:40:59,086 --> 00:41:01,728
You can play with me and my friend if you want.

567
00:41:01,912 --> 00:41:03,079
What friend?

568
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:05,486
He's 'maginary.

569
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,287
His name's Wilbur. He's a giraffe.

570
00:41:08,563 --> 00:41:09,869
What kind of giraffe?

571
00:41:09,987 --> 00:41:11,483
The spotted kind.

572
00:41:11,645 --> 00:41:13,284
The kind that lives in Africa?

573
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:16,509
Well, of course Africa. That's where spotted giraffes are from.

574
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:24,732
