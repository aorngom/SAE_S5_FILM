1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,205
Elisha? The doctor will see you now.

2
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:13,313
Mom, I'm 14.

3
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:15,627
Well, I mean, I always go in with you.

4
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:18,023
Mom, I'll be fine. It's just my knee.

5
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:20,592
Fine...

6
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:22,082
I guess.

7
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:35,058
Can I help you?

8
00:00:35,153 --> 00:00:38,605
I don't know. It just seems like my daughter's been in there an awfully long time.

9
00:00:39,968 --> 00:00:40,719
Doctor?

10
00:00:41,518 --> 00:00:44,067
Mrs. Walters was just wondering about an ETA on Elisha.

11
00:00:50,913 --> 00:00:51,609
Doctor?

12
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:58,486
Doctor, please open this door.

13
00:00:58,602 --> 00:01:00,164
Oh, my God. Something's wrong. I can feel it.

14
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,862
- Doctor?!
- What's going on?

15
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:05,417
I don't know. The door's locked.

16
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,102
What do you mean, locked? I need to see my daughter.

17
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:11,399
- Mrs. Walters, you should really wait...
- Open that door! Open it right now!

18
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:12,494
I need to see my daughter!

19
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:15,352
Elisha!

20
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:16,606
Elisha?!

21
00:01:17,256 --> 00:01:17,983
Elisha?!

22
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:31,791
First, do no harm.

23
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:37,362
I swear in the presence of the Almighty and before my family, my teachers and my peers

24
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:41,913
that according to my ability and judgment, I will keep this Oath and Stipulation.

25
00:01:43,727 --> 00:01:44,444
Ladies...

26
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:47,981
if you'll kindly take a seat in the waiting room,

27
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,884
the Doctor and I will finish up and be with you shortly.

28
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:43,713
Daddy, this is completely unfair.

29
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:47,017
Nighttime is for homework. Mornings are for breakfast and getting dressed and...

30
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:48,485
Not if you don't do your homework at night.

31
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:51,384
And not if you don't tell anybody about it until ten minutes from walking out the door.

32
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:53,687
This isn't really homework. We're just supposed to guess!

33
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,219
Ariel, it's really homework.

34
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:57,035
Look, if you don't want my help, just say "Daddy..."

35
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:59,417
Daddy, I don't want your help.

36
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:00,201
Hey.

37
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:05,894
All right. Never mind. Help.

38
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,024
- Come on. This is easy.
- Here. This is easy.

39
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:12,200
We stack the pennies ten pennies high, we measure that, okay?

40
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:16,947
- One-half inch.
- One-half inch.

41
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:18,940
One-half inch. And then move the stacks into a cube,

42
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:21,760
which is four stacks wide, four stacks deep, okay?

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,528
Then you measure the width and the depth of that square and multiply that by the height.

44
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:29,524
We can calculate the volume of 160 pennies.

45
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:30,855
- Cool.
- Okay?

46
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:33,481
And once you know that, you can divide the volume of this container

47
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:36,036
by that number and calculate how many pennies are in there.

48
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:39,348
The assignment is to guess how many pennies are in the jar.

49
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:42,025
So why can't we just, you know, guess?

50
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:45,328
Because math isn't about guessing. Math is about calculation. So let's calculate.

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,449
Math is about stupid.

52
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:49,558
Well, I like math.

53
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,288
What a surprise.

54
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:53,101
Sweetie, don't get upset. Just do it.

55
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:57,675
Anything?

56
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,804
A lot of horror stories about medicine,

57
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,840
but most of them are about people losing their health insurance.

58
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:05,906
Nothing about a 14-year-old girl in a soccer uniform.

59
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:06,746
Excellent.

60
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:07,981
Why aren't you smiling?

61
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:10,981
Do they all have to come true?

62
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:12,379
Do they all have to mean something?

63
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,959
Well, I'm not rooting for a teenage girl to get hacked to death

64
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:16,740
by her doctor if that's what you mean.

65
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:19,593
You're right. It's like checking the answering machine.

66
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,394
Not everybody who leaves a message is important, but

67
00:04:22,782 --> 00:04:25,322
you'd sure hate to miss the message that is.

68
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,530
On March third, 1991, a Dr. Kenneth Holloway was treating

69
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:32,485
a 14-year-old girl for some kind of sports injury.

70
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:35,452
After he and the girl had been in the exam room for over an hour,

71
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,323
the mother asked the nurse to check on them.

72
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:39,217
Just like in your dream.

73
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:43,484
Holloway had molested the girl and then he began savagely dissecting her.

74
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:46,310
He had already removed her small and large intestine

75
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:49,114
when the nurse and the victim's mother finally broke in on him.

76
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:52,422
That's him.

77
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,096
That's the guy I dreamt about.

78
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,759
1991? Are you sure?

79
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:57,594
Check the file.

80
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:00,947
I remember they stuck him in the Halcott Institute.

81
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:04,470
State-run mental facility outside Yuma.

82
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:07,076
I don't understand. They found him with the body.

83
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:09,057
He admitted he killed her. Why isn't he in prison?

84
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,398
I was Assistant D.A. at the time.

85
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:15,314
I didn't handle the case, but I remember that Holloway claimed

86
00:05:15,364 --> 00:05:20,158
that he had been hearing voices urging him to butcher young girls for almost two years.

87
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:24,985
His lawyer argued that since this was the first and only child his client had hurt

88
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:29,275
that he shouldn't be punished for his crime, but instead be treated for his illness.

89
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:31,278
And the jury agreed.

90
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:33,649
Who's this?

91
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:35,497
That's Brittany Walters.

92
00:05:37,256 --> 00:05:38,723
The girl Dr. Holloway murdered?

93
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:41,344
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

94
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:42,839
It says right here.

95
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:46,019
This isn't the same girl from my dream.

96
00:05:46,925 --> 00:05:48,078
She looked different and

97
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:50,637
I don't think her name was Brittany.

98
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:55,362
They called her "Elisha." Everyone called her Elisha.

99
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,577
I don't know what to tell you.

100
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,767
- What about the other guy?
- What "other guy"?

101
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:02,188
There was another man in the room.

102
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:05,694
He wore a dark suit. He had these piercing eyes.

103
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,065
I don't recall ever hearing about someone else being involved.

104
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,823
Allison, this crime was solved over 14 years ago.

105
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:17,947
What do we think?

106
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,176
You're amazing.

107
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,231
You think I could get maybe a hundred copies for the District Attorney?

108
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,265
What are the chances of my, uh...?

109
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:32,188
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?

110
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:35,196
No, no, no. We're just making copies. Could you come back in ten minutes?

111
00:06:38,828 --> 00:06:39,673
Who might this be?

112
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:40,952
Looks familiar.

113
00:06:43,015 --> 00:06:44,387
Someone's accomplice, I think.

114
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:45,581
What'd he do?

115
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,552
He and his friend raped a young girl,

116
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:49,626
sliced her open, took her apart.

117
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:52,190
Wow. How come I didn't hear about this?

118
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:53,717
It happened a while ago.

119
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:54,991
'91, I think.

120
00:06:55,837 --> 00:06:56,627
Excuse me?

121
00:06:58,411 --> 00:06:59,809
I had one of my things.

122
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:01,273
They never caught the guy?

123
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:02,513
They caught one of them.

124
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:04,767
But this guy got away?

125
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:07,371
Kinda. Sorta. I don't think they knew he was there.

126
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:09,722
I see.

127
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:12,655
Cold case with a suspect that no one's even looking for.

128
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:15,374
I don't pick 'em, Detective Scanlon. They pick me.

129
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:21,621
So then Mr. Beauchamp starts passing out the pennies,

130
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:24,058
60 or 70 on each person's desk.

131
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,444
And then we start counting them up,

132
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:29,132
and we write down the totals on the board and add them up:

133
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,286
1,823 pennies exactly.

134
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,428
Exactly.

135
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:34,794
Exactly.

136
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:37,994
Is that even close to a katrillion?

137
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:39,274
It's close.

138
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,490
Oh, also, Miss Bishop sent home a note about something.

139
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:43,487
It's in my book bag.

140
00:07:45,328 --> 00:07:46,882
It think it might be about math camp.

141
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:49,439
If it is, I don't want to go.

142
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:52,494
You get that, I'll get the phone.

143
00:07:58,429 --> 00:07:59,028
Hello.

144
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:01,962
Allison? It's Lee Scanlon. Am I catching you at a bad time?

145
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:04,061
No. I'm just putting the kids to bed. What's going on?

146
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:06,830
I know how weird this sounds, but I think I found your guy.

147
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:07,947
The one with the beard.

148
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:09,774
The one who likes to hack up girls?

149
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:10,705
You're kidding.

150
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,010
No. Remember I said he looked familiar?

151
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,295
Now I know why.

152
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:18,524
I'm at this place I come to three or four times a week to have dinner, and there he is.

153
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,778
Is there any way I could get you to come down here and I.D. him?

154
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:24,771
Her math teacher wants to meet with one of us.

155
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:28,478
I don't think he meant right now.

156
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,446
So he's got a bunch of times down here for tomorrow.

157
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:33,604
Are you all right with 2:00?

158
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:36,106
'Cause if you are, I'll just sign this thing and put it back in Ariel's book bag

159
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,756
and then he'll know to expect you.

160
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:38,473
Sure.

161
00:08:39,327 --> 00:08:41,094
Detective Scanlon called.

162
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,987
Seems he spotted my bearded accomplice.

163
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:45,764
The one from 1991?

164
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:49,702
And you're getting dressed because...

165
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:52,892
you're afraid to meet him in your dreams and be naked?

166
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:56,265
He's at a restaurant downtown.

167
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,375
I see.

168
00:08:58,422 --> 00:08:59,705
I'll only be an hour.

169
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,556
Hmm. I'll be here.

170
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:05,005
You'd better be.

171
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,447
Did you see him?

172
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,050
Don't look around.

173
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:26,867
Don't call attention to yourself.

174
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:29,545
Follow me.

175
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:33,519
Act like we're together. I'm gonna casually walk by him.

176
00:09:58,704 --> 00:09:59,636
So, did you see him?

177
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:02,052
- No, I was waiting for you...
- You're kidding!

178
00:10:03,173 --> 00:10:04,582
How about right now? Do you see him?

179
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:08,928
He's right behind me.

180
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,985
Dr. Charles "The Butcher" Walker of Wichita.

181
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:18,380
Wanted dead or alive for the maniacal evisceration

182
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:20,525
of three unmarried daughters from the Great Plains.

183
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:24,519
Pretty good match, right?

184
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:26,864
Knew I'd seen him before. Who knew?

185
00:10:27,013 --> 00:10:28,154
Turns out he's a regular.

186
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,674
The thing is, since he was captured and lynched by an angry mob in 1902,

187
00:10:33,863 --> 00:10:37,011
I'm not completely certain I can put him at the scene of the Brittany Walters murder.

188
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:41,179
Oh, come on. It's funny.

189
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:44,030
You have to admit it's funny, right?

190
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:48,286
All right. Maybe you don't.

191
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:51,542
Hi.

192
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,634
You know it's 2:45 in the morning?

193
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,792
I had so much room to move around in bed, I woke myself up.

194
00:11:01,097 --> 00:11:03,601
So what's it like supping with a serial killer? I mean...

195
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:05,986
who paid the check?

196
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:09,836
There was no supping. There was no check.

197
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,329
Turns out my serial killer was dead.

198
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:15,826
Mm, honey. That bastard.

199
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:17,645
Standing up my wife.

200
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:20,292
If he wasn't already dead, I'd kill him.

201
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:24,356
Uh, hey, here's a crazy thought.

202
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:27,547
How 'bout you shut down that computer and come to bed with your husband?

203
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:30,480
Turns out he's been dead for over a century.

204
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:32,400
Clearly he's a man of conviction.

205
00:11:33,122 --> 00:11:34,659
So what about this sleeping thing?

206
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,452
You game?

207
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:36,722
You wanna give it a shot?

208
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,253
"Dr. Charles Walker, born 1870 in Wichita, Kansas,

209
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,094
died in 1902 in Phoenix, Arizona..."

210
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:49,358
And in between?

211
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:53,326
And in between, he raped and murdered 14 young women in cold blood.

212
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:56,726
He'd go from town to town, he'd set up his shingle,

213
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,799
pick out a victim and bide his time.

214
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:02,117
Wait for her to seek him out for some kind of medical problem.

215
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:05,538
Then he'd send his nurse home, spend a few hours

216
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:08,631
torturing the girl with various medical devices.

217
00:12:09,741 --> 00:12:13,110
Finally, he'd cut her open and leave her for her family to find.

218
00:12:14,596 --> 00:12:16,003
Who does that sound like?

219
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,801
I just, I don't understand.

220
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:23,110
Why am I dreaming about Holloway now?

221
00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:24,948
That was almost 15 years ago.

222
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,808
And why am I dreaming about Walker at all? He's...

223
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,287
Sleeping soundly.

224
00:12:32,274 --> 00:12:33,693
...Bush in Washington.

225
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:34,731
Hello?

226
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:36,938
May 23, 2005...

227
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,558
Yes, I'm holding for the doctor.

228
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:43,958
I understand, but I really need to bring my daughter in there today.

229
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:48,035
She's been on the medication for a week now,

230
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:49,777
but she's not getting any better.

231
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:52,756
In fact, I think she might actually be getting worse.

232
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:55,746
No, I'm totally flexible.

233
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:57,757
I just want to get her in there.

234
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:00,371
Thank you.

235
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:02,724
Thank you so much.

236
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:04,931
We'll see you then.

237
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,031
Mom?

238
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:12,892
What's wrong with me?

239
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:15,621
Elisha baby, don't worry.

240
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:18,115
The doctor will fix everything.

241
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,157
I need a favor.

242
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:44,949
You know, I've imagined waking up like this a bunch of times,

243
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:47,238
but in my version you weren't dressed.

244
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,786
Can you take the girls to school this morning?

245
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,200
Hmm, wait, this is completely different from anything I imagined.

246
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:57,673
And can you pick them up this afternoon?

247
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:00,135
I see. My mistake.

248
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,677
What this is is a nightmare.

249
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:03,720
It just took me a second to pick up on it.

250
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:05,788
Wonderful-- I tell you I need a favor

251
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:08,450
and instead I get a front row table at The Belly Room.

252
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,314
And just why do you need this favor?

253
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,332
Where are you going to be exactly?

254
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,910
Yuma. Exactly.

255
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:16,121
Why, pray tell, are you gonna be in Yuma?

256
00:14:16,494 --> 00:14:18,808
I need to talk to Dr. Kenneth Holloway.

257
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,827
Who's' that, the psycho doctor from 1991?

258
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:23,903
About what?

259
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:26,631
About a girl named Elisha. I had another dream about her last night,

260
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,330
and now I know she's not from 1991.

261
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:32,745
She's actually from right now, and I think she's in danger.

262
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:36,013
But he's been behind bars for 14 years. What's he going to tell you?

263
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,585
I don't know. But he's the only person in any of my dreams that's actually alive.

264
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,639
I have to do something.

265
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:44,490
- I have to talk to someone.
- But he's four hours away.

266
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,665
Please.

267
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:53,169
All right.

268
00:14:55,827 --> 00:14:56,599
Thank you.

269
00:14:58,899 --> 00:14:59,825
Wait. No.

270
00:15:01,474 --> 00:15:03,292
Ariel's math teacher. 2:00.

271
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,840
Oh, damn.

272
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:09,115
All right, fine.

273
00:15:09,196 --> 00:15:10,445
I'll take care of it. I'll handle it.

274
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:12,386
I'll change something around. I'll figure something out.

275
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:13,240
Are you mad?

276
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:15,335
Very good, mind reader.

277
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,430
You know what, we'll have this fight when you get back tonight.

278
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,434
Deal.

279
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:23,507
You see my problem, don't you?

280
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:25,441
1,788.

281
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:26,507
That was her estimate.

282
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:31,637
Her computations, her worksheet, they all led her to 1,788.

283
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:34,464
Which, by the way, would have been a wonderful answer.

284
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,971
The whole point of this exercise was to teach her how to estimate,

285
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:39,901
and she clearly understands how to estimate.

286
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,104
Okay, so...?

287
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:44,740
So the answer she ultimately submitted,

288
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:51,257
the perfect answer by the way, the exact answer, was 1,823.

289
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:56,080
1,823.

290
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:59,424
You can plainly see that her work doesn't match her result.

291
00:15:59,515 --> 00:16:03,377
She clearly didn't arrive at that number based on any sort of arithmetic process.

292
00:16:06,606 --> 00:16:08,388
How do you suppose she came up with it?

293
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:16,268
Well, I have the number written down here, in my lesson plan.

294
00:16:16,673 --> 00:16:17,825
I keep it on my desk--

295
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:20,861
cover closed, but on my desk.

296
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,976
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you suggesting she cheated?

297
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:27,005
My daughter somehow snuck up to your desk and looked in your book?

298
00:16:27,523 --> 00:16:29,518
What other logical explanation could there be?

299
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,965
How well do you know my daughter, Mr. Beauchamp?

300
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:35,761
My daughter's not capable of cheating.

301
00:16:35,856 --> 00:16:38,081
Look, I understand this isn't something a parent wants to hear.

302
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,625
She guessed, that's all. She made an educated guess.

303
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:42,596
She has very strong instincts about things,

304
00:16:42,662 --> 00:16:45,770
and I'm sure notwithstanding what it says on her worksheet,

305
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:47,726
she just looked at that jar, it just didn't feel like 1,700...

306
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:49,931
Mr. Dubois, do you know what the odds are that someone would guess

307
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,812
the exact number of pennies in that jar?

308
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,178
1,823 to one.

309
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:55,749
Mm, well, see that? You're wrong.

310
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:57,198
- Excuse me?
- Well, you're wrong.

311
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,415
- Out of what, 25 kids?
- Yeah.

312
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:03,087
So assuming that no one guessed under 1,000, the chance that any one of them

313
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,527
would have guessed the exact number is actually 25 out of 1,800 and whatever.

314
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:08,463
That's about one in 40.

315
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:10,458
What are you, a...?

316
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:11,600
A mathematician, actually.

317
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:14,979
The point is is that one in 40 is not entirely out of the realm of possibility.

318
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:16,607
Mr. Dubois, she changed her answer.

319
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,453
Impulsively. Who knows why? She's a kid.

320
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:20,674
She didn't look in your book. She didn't cheat.

321
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,860
- You don't know that.
- You don't know that she did.

322
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:27,376
Okay, wait a second. You're a mathematician. Let's talk probabilities, huh?

323
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:30,790
Are you suggesting there's a greater probability that she just happened to guess

324
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:32,894
the right answer than that she looked in my book?

325
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:35,567
I'm saying I know my daughter better than you do. I'm saying I know she didn't cheat.

326
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:38,980
And I'm saying if you penalize her based on your completely unfounded suspicion,

327
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,877
then I am going over your head.

328
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:43,048
Are you threatening me, Mr. Dubois?

329
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:52,505
Do you think he's dangerous?

330
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:55,838
Well, he hasn't attacked anyone in the last 12 years, if that's what you mean.

331
00:17:57,191 --> 00:18:02,571
Listen, all we know is that for as long as people have been writing about human behavior,

332
00:18:02,638 --> 00:18:04,629
there have been guys like Dr. Holloway.

333
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:08,464
They used to call them possessed, or, uh, split personalities.

334
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,185
Kenneth Holloway uffers from a dissociative identity disorder.

335
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:15,704
He won't get better.

336
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:17,229
Ever.

337
00:18:19,738 --> 00:18:20,343
All right.

338
00:18:29,595 --> 00:18:30,599
Dr. Holloway.

339
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:35,641
My name's Allison Dubois. I'm with the Phoenix District Attorney's office.

340
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:38,294
Please call me Ken.

341
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:40,326
I'd shake your hand, but...

342
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:44,679
Thank you for meeting me on such short notice.

343
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:45,425
Thank you.

344
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,981
I don't have many visitors.

345
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:50,925
Thanks for breaking up the monotony of my day.

346
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,967
Do you know this man?

347
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,142
No. I'm sorry.

348
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:08,271
I don't believe I've ever seen that man before.

349
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:09,464
He's a doctor.

350
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:12,706
Likes to rape and cut up young girls.

351
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:18,158
We don't have a union, Miss Dubois.

352
00:19:18,235 --> 00:19:19,823
It's not like I've seen him at the meetings.

353
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:24,410
What about the name Elisha?

354
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:28,019
A young girl around 14 or 15.

355
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,812
Do you know anyone by that name?

356
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:39,504
How many girls?

357
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,389
Fourteen.

358
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:49,600
Does he hear the voice?

359
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:51,479
I don't know.

360
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:53,446
When you find him, ask him.

361
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:55,919
He'll know what I'm talking about.

362
00:19:56,184 --> 00:19:57,823
And if he's honest, he'll tell you.

363
00:19:58,479 --> 00:19:59,365
You tell me.

364
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:03,491
I don't know.

365
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:06,040
It starts off very quietly.

366
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:08,961
Mostly when you're alone.

367
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,243
In the shower. In the car.

368
00:20:12,768 --> 00:20:15,810
At night in bed, when my wife was sleeping.

369
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:18,973
But then you start to hear it everywhere.

370
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:19,886
In crowds.

371
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,719
In church. On the street.

372
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:22,907
At a baseball game.

373
00:20:23,665 --> 00:20:24,974
"Look at her. Look at that."

374
00:20:25,717 --> 00:20:28,226
"Don't you want to see it? Don't you want to touch it?"

375
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,821
"Don't you want to cut it open and stick your hands in it?"

376
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:35,969
And then...

377
00:20:38,124 --> 00:20:39,546
it's all on you here.

378
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,421
He lives inside you...

379
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,988
and you can't find yourself anymore.

380
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:05,310
Whatcha doing?

381
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:07,609
Nothing.

382
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:09,238
Counting the stars?

383
00:21:10,483 --> 00:21:11,624
Estimating, darling.

384
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,122
All you can do is estimate.

385
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:16,918
Sorry I missed dinner and everything.

386
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:18,674
I ran into traffic on the way back.

387
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,066
That's all right, we're fine.

388
00:21:20,532 --> 00:21:22,202
That's why God created drive-thru.

389
00:21:22,611 --> 00:21:23,810
Dinner of champions.

390
00:21:24,844 --> 00:21:25,862
So, is everyone sleeping?

391
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,341
Ariel's math teacher, Mr. Beauchamp,

392
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:32,711
he thinks our daughter's a cheater.

393
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,310
What?

394
00:21:34,449 --> 00:21:38,074
Turns out he kept the exact number of pennies in a lesson plan on his desk,

395
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,661
and he somehow got the idea that Ariel...

396
00:21:40,322 --> 00:21:41,320
She wouldn't do that.

397
00:21:43,665 --> 00:21:45,713
Okay, so what did you tell him?

398
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:47,716
Well, I told him she made a lucky guess.

399
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:52,512
He told me that made no sense, and even though I knew he was right, I also knew that I was right.

400
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,169
And I told him if he penalized my daughter for being a cheater, I was gonna go the principal.

401
00:21:56,256 --> 00:21:57,366
No, you didn't.

402
00:21:57,534 --> 00:21:59,650
Well... she's not a cheater.

403
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:06,526
Hello?

404
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,378
Yes, Dr. McGrath.

405
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,937
No, of course I can.

406
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,356
All right, tomorrow, then.

407
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:16,675
So, how did you leave it with the principal?

408
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:17,647
Who was on the phone?

409
00:22:17,974 --> 00:22:18,615
Joe...

410
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,322
He gave me a choice. It's up to me.

411
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:24,318
Either I can file a formal complaint against Mr. Beauchamp

412
00:22:24,394 --> 00:22:26,331
or Ariel can change math teachers.

413
00:22:26,524 --> 00:22:27,937
I got to let him know tomorrow.

414
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:29,161
Those are the choices?

415
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:30,565
I did the best I could do.

416
00:22:30,897 --> 00:22:33,790
That's sort of like shooting a cannon to kill a flea.

417
00:22:33,898 --> 00:22:37,369
Well, hey, you know, I'm not the one who ran off all day talking to some guy

418
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,908
who's been behind bars for 15 years, who couldn't possibly know

419
00:22:39,954 --> 00:22:42,679
anything about anything concerning the here and now.

420
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,014
Excuse me, it's my job.

421
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:47,548
You know, I been thinking about that, too, and as a matter of fact, it's not your job.

422
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:51,055
You're starting to think that every time you dream a dream, you're somehow on the clock.

423
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:55,315
This wasn't a case that was assigned to you, this is something you chose to do.

424
00:22:55,413 --> 00:22:56,094
Fine.

425
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:59,790
I will go to school tomorrow and see if I can speak with Mr. Beauchamp.

426
00:23:00,348 --> 00:23:02,222
Good. Let's see how you make out.

427
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,806
- Okay. Let's.
- Good.

428
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:05,494
Damn it!

429
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:07,956
Oh, my. A hink in the plan already.

430
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:10,814
On the phone just now-- Kenneth Holloway.

431
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:15,728
Apparently, shortly after I left, he became extremely agitated, demanded to talk to me.

432
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:19,708
He told his doctor that there was something he hadn't told me before, something about Elisha.

433
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:21,651
Wait, I'm having a déjà vu.

434
00:23:22,616 --> 00:23:26,451
I will call and make an appointment to see him day after tomorrow.

435
00:23:26,557 --> 00:23:29,414
Right. I'm sorry, the... teacher or the murderer?

436
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:50,796
Sorry.

437
00:23:51,928 --> 00:23:52,593
For what?

438
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,429
Making you come back.

439
00:24:01,057 --> 00:24:01,891
Okay.

440
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:05,516
Is something wrong?

441
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:09,006
I don't know.

442
00:24:12,142 --> 00:24:13,248
It's the drugs.

443
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:16,470
Been raising a bit of a ruckus since you left,

444
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,219
so they started in with the meds again.

445
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:22,357
I don't care, it's... it's kind of nice, actually.

446
00:24:22,803 --> 00:24:25,306
Smooths out the ride, if you know what I mean.

447
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,055
She's dead, by the way.

448
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:30,770
I'm sorry, who's dead?

449
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:33,365
Elisha.

450
00:24:35,244 --> 00:24:36,551
That's not possible.

451
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:39,130
- How can you say that?
- I just saw her.

452
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:43,068
I don't think so, young lady. You came here yesterday looking for her.

453
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:47,958
Unless, by "seeing," you mean with something other than the eyes.

454
00:24:48,818 --> 00:24:50,062
So you killed her.

455
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:53,097
Hm? Unbeknownst to anybody while you were in here,

456
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:54,179
you killed her.

457
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:58,360
I am psychologically impaired, but I'm not an idiot.

458
00:24:59,591 --> 00:25:01,341
It was in 1990.

459
00:25:03,286 --> 00:25:05,524
I'd been hearing the voice for about a year,

460
00:25:05,949 --> 00:25:09,283
but there were always people around, and for a long time, I was able to...

461
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:10,854
not listen.

462
00:25:11,607 --> 00:25:14,787
But that June, I was driving from Phoenix to Los Angeles

463
00:25:14,885 --> 00:25:18,177
for a medical conference all by myself.

464
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:24,407
I was on I-10, that long stretch of road where it's just a single lane,

465
00:25:24,642 --> 00:25:26,302
nothing but empty desert.

466
00:25:27,232 --> 00:25:29,352
And, inexplicably,

467
00:25:30,003 --> 00:25:32,400
she was just standing there.

468
00:25:34,411 --> 00:25:36,879
I saw her from miles away.

469
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,838
I thought she was an optical illusion at first,

470
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,435
but I kept getting closer, and she refused to disappear.

471
00:25:45,497 --> 00:25:47,406
It was like she was taunting me.

472
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:51,447
She was standing on the shoulder with her thumb out.

473
00:25:52,531 --> 00:25:55,045
She was wearing jeans and a T-shirt,

474
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,689
and she had those baby breasts they get at that age.

475
00:25:59,776 --> 00:26:00,723
Dr. Holloway...

476
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,898
She was thirsty. I gave her a soda.

477
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:08,173
A soda and some sleeping pills.

478
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:13,534
And by Ely, Nevada, she was out.

479
00:26:15,034 --> 00:26:16,965
I rented a hotel room.

480
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:21,572
You don't want to hear the rest.

481
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,919
Hm. I remember you.

482
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:41,191
Sorry.

483
00:26:44,654 --> 00:26:47,884
Hello. Mr. Beauchamp, this is, uh, Allison Dubois.

484
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:50,638
I am Ariel's mother, and I was hoping to speak with you

485
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:55,462
at your earliest convenience about the misunderstanding about Ariel and the penny jar.

486
00:26:55,518 --> 00:27:00,844
Uh, if you could give me a call, at 602-555-0147...

487
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:03,054
Yes. 'Course I mean it.

488
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,214
I got to call you right back.

489
00:27:06,594 --> 00:27:07,418
What's this?

490
00:27:07,908 --> 00:27:10,044
It's nothing-- which is the good news.

491
00:27:10,151 --> 00:27:12,343
There were no Elishas reported missing or dead in the states

492
00:27:12,405 --> 00:27:16,234
of Arizona, California, Texas or Nevada for the whole of 1990.

493
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:19,362
No Elishas. No Allyces.

494
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,122
One Lisa, but she was in her '60s.

495
00:27:22,414 --> 00:27:24,078
I don't get it. Why would he lie to me?

496
00:27:25,475 --> 00:27:29,309
Allison, the man's a sociopath-- maybe it gave him some pleasure knowing

497
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:33,027
that you'd be spinning your wheels all day looking for a girl who doesn't even exist.

498
00:27:33,545 --> 00:27:36,166
Maybe he just thinks it's fun.

499
00:27:41,988 --> 00:27:42,770
You lied to me.

500
00:27:42,853 --> 00:27:43,636
You lied to me.

501
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:44,691
You said you killed her.

502
00:27:44,758 --> 00:27:46,028
You said you saw her.

503
00:27:46,401 --> 00:27:47,551
I guess we're even.

504
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:50,722
You've got the vision, don't you?

505
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,349
Who am I talking to?

506
00:27:53,845 --> 00:27:56,149
Who do you think you're talking to?

507
00:27:58,001 --> 00:27:59,846
I want to show you something.

508
00:28:00,014 --> 00:28:00,711
By all means.

509
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:03,861
1934, Dr. Eric Lorenz murdered a 16-year-old patient

510
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,926
who was complaining of swollen tonsils. He said he heard voices.

511
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:10,942
1950, Dr. Kevin Deibolt raped and murdered a 12-year-old patient

512
00:28:10,998 --> 00:28:14,730
while her mother and two brothers sat in the waiting room-- he said he heard a voice.

513
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:15,498
Interesting.

514
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:19,784
In 1960, Dr. Peter Seanery raped and murdered a 13-year-old

515
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,956
at a public health clinic in Detroit.

516
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:26,040
There's another one in 1977. You killed her in '91.

517
00:28:26,676 --> 00:28:31,309
Seems like every 15 years or so, someone hears a voice and a young girl dies.

518
00:28:32,564 --> 00:28:34,504
Have any hungers, ma'am?

519
00:28:36,644 --> 00:28:38,513
I'll let you in on a secret.

520
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:42,563
When you die, they don't go away.

521
00:28:46,255 --> 00:28:47,974
You saw us in a dream, right?

522
00:28:48,338 --> 00:28:49,301
Me and the girl?

523
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:52,947
I've heard about the likes of you.

524
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:55,926
You see souls, don't you?

525
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:56,986
You got the vision.

526
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,874
Where is she?

527
00:29:01,486 --> 00:29:05,061
How can you know so much and know so little?

528
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:09,970
You're obviously extraordinarily sensitive.

529
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:11,998
Most people aren't sensitive at all.

530
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:15,924
Then some people are a little sensitive.

531
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:18,741
They certainly don't see the dead.

532
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,886
Don't even hear 'em.

533
00:29:22,085 --> 00:29:25,509
They just feel something strange once in a while,

534
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:30,718
hear a really distant voice telling them what to do.

535
00:29:31,285 --> 00:29:34,706
"Don't make that right turn-- that's not the way to Grandma's."

536
00:29:35,422 --> 00:29:38,678
"Don't answer the phone call-- it's bad news."

537
00:29:39,636 --> 00:29:42,012
"Don't marry that man-- he's no good for you."

538
00:29:42,652 --> 00:29:44,454
When I find one like that--

539
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,277
a doctor...

540
00:29:47,607 --> 00:29:49,564
a doctor-to-be...

541
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:53,634
Yeah. It takes 15 years.

542
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:57,060
First four or five, you're screaming just to be heard. Then...

543
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,537
they start listening for you.

544
00:30:02,421 --> 00:30:05,142
Then you're all they hear.

545
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:06,471
Where is she?

546
00:30:06,732 --> 00:30:08,917
It doesn't matter; no one's gonna kill her.

547
00:30:09,005 --> 00:30:10,198
You have my word.

548
00:30:10,674 --> 00:30:12,324
Cross my heart and hope to...

549
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,524
whatever.

550
00:30:15,087 --> 00:30:15,983
Where is she!

551
00:30:16,157 --> 00:30:20,033
I know what you're planning; I know the date you plan on doing it; I will find her!

552
00:30:25,307 --> 00:30:26,239
Mr. Beauchamp.

553
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:28,947
Allison Dubois.

554
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,892
I'm Ariel's mother.

555
00:30:32,229 --> 00:30:36,131
I know, I'm 35 minutes late and I know you're on your way out the door

556
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:39,151
and I'm sorry, but I didn't get your message till almost 1:00.

557
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,413
I work for the District Attorney's Office and I was interviewing a prisoner

558
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:44,609
and they don't let you take your cell phone in with you.

559
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:49,321
But, actually, and I think this is germane to the conversation,

560
00:30:50,072 --> 00:30:53,252
I kind of guessed that you were going to want to see me this afternoon,

561
00:30:53,374 --> 00:30:56,239
so even though I didn't get your message till I was an hour and a half outside of Yuma,

562
00:30:56,324 --> 00:30:57,718
I've been rushing back the whole time.

563
00:30:58,296 --> 00:31:01,259
So, if you need to reschedule, if you need to leave...

564
00:31:02,388 --> 00:31:04,252
I completely understand.

565
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:07,716
No, I'm perfectly happy to stay. I just...

566
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:13,467
I can't imagine what you're going to say that's going to change my point of view about the situation.

567
00:31:13,774 --> 00:31:15,141
My daughter didn't cheat.

568
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:17,584
And I know you absolutely believe that,

569
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,360
and frankly, I'd like to believe that.

570
00:31:19,826 --> 00:31:22,170
But there's simply no other explanation for what happened.

571
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:23,200
But there is.

572
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,640
She guessed.

573
00:31:29,175 --> 00:31:30,584
I went through this with your husband, but...

574
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,647
No, I know, and I'm sorry that got so heated.

575
00:31:32,722 --> 00:31:34,361
Nobody's filing any complaints.

576
00:31:34,485 --> 00:31:36,178
Nobody's changing classes.

577
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,857
And I wouldn't even be here wasting your time except the one thing that he didn't tell you,

578
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:43,358
that he probably should have,

579
00:31:44,268 --> 00:31:45,079
is that...

580
00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:49,096
on my side of the family--

581
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:54,017
my grandmother, me, Ariel--

582
00:31:55,303 --> 00:31:57,454
we've just, we've always been good at guessing.

583
00:31:58,969 --> 00:31:59,747
I know.

584
00:32:00,525 --> 00:32:03,341
What parents won't do to make sure their kids get good grades.

585
00:32:03,407 --> 00:32:05,639
But in this case, it happens to be true.

586
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:10,592
I mean, your initials T.O.B., I'm guessing "O" stands for Oliver.

587
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:12,757
Good guessing, right?

588
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,734
I know, kind of a silly thing, but...

589
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,492
I've just always had it and Ariel has it, too.

590
00:32:21,994 --> 00:32:22,660
Mrs. Dubois...

591
00:32:22,756 --> 00:32:25,050
Dentist, tomorrow afternoon, right?

592
00:32:26,105 --> 00:32:29,167
I didn't look through any of your books, I swear.

593
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:32,162
The irony is...

594
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,490
it embarrasses her.

595
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:38,644
I mean, if you mention it to anybody,

596
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:40,897
she would die of mortification.

597
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,359
And I do need to sit down with her and have a conversation

598
00:32:44,435 --> 00:32:47,224
about the difference between being asked a question in class

599
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:50,246
and giving a considered, worked out answer and just...

600
00:32:51,198 --> 00:32:54,761
guessing, and for that, I do apologize.

601
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:58,601
So I just wanted to stop by and tell you that

602
00:32:59,497 --> 00:33:02,252
whatever decision you make, we can live with it,

603
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,976
because I know you'll make the right decision.

604
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:06,907
I know it.

605
00:33:08,023 --> 00:33:09,733
Well, at least I'm pretty sure.

606
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:14,765
See? You'll still have time to make it to the car wash.

607
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:21,780
You can't just do that. You can't just tell me you fixed it and not tell me how.

608
00:33:22,032 --> 00:33:23,510
I didn't fix it. I just...

609
00:33:24,422 --> 00:33:27,981
followed it through. I followed your bad cop with my good cop.

610
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,881
You're patronizing me.

611
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:35,445
I just shifted the conversation from "probabilities" to "possibilities."

612
00:33:35,518 --> 00:33:39,854
The point is... our eldest daughter's record remains blemish-free.

613
00:33:39,992 --> 00:33:44,046
And there's still a chance that she can learn to smoke pot at the college of her choice.

614
00:33:47,206 --> 00:33:47,967
Come here.

615
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:01,742
Kiss me, will ya?

616
00:34:13,048 --> 00:34:16,298
You think you could see your way clear to climb over here and hold me...

617
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,228
tell me everything is going to be okay?

618
00:34:18,674 --> 00:34:21,131
Why wouldn't everything be okay, hmm?

619
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:27,219
Why wouldn't everything be okay?

620
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:30,593
Day after tomorrow...

621
00:34:31,812 --> 00:34:34,223
a young girl named Elisha is gonna die,

622
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,660
and I don't have a clue how to stop it.

623
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,081
Why don't you call the police?

624
00:34:51,044 --> 00:34:51,919
I'm sorry.

625
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:54,718
I need your help.

626
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:57,270
...Bush in Washington.

627
00:34:57,786 --> 00:35:01,723
Whatever it is that's gonna happen I know it's gonna happen tomorrow, the 23rd.

628
00:35:01,903 --> 00:35:03,998
The mother's on the phone with the doctor's office,

629
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:06,204
her daughter's sick, the medicine isn't working.

630
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:09,132
When her mother's on the phone, does she mention the doctor's name?

631
00:35:09,444 --> 00:35:10,771
No. She's in a hurry.

632
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:12,224
So the girl's hurt?

633
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:14,729
Not hurt. Sick, I think.

634
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:17,759
She's taking something. Her mother's holding a prescription bottle.

635
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:18,885
Can you see anything?

636
00:35:23,141 --> 00:35:26,075
 "L-I-T-H."

637
00:35:26,822 --> 00:35:27,630
Lithium?

638
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,397
Maybe. Does that help?

639
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,757
Well, Lithium is a drug they give to manic depressives.

640
00:35:31,932 --> 00:35:34,056
Which means your girl is sick all right, but not with the flu.

641
00:35:34,118 --> 00:35:37,031
So maybe the doctor that the mother called was a psychiatrist.

642
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,653
Which narrows down our search by a few thousand...

643
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:42,713
It's a long shot, but I might be able to track the doctor through the prescription.

644
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:47,192
If you're a pharmacist handing lithium to a minor, you might be inclined to remember...

645
00:35:47,266 --> 00:35:48,551
Excuse me. It's my precinct.

646
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:50,083
Detective Scanlon.

647
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:52,663
A doctor?

648
00:35:53,717 --> 00:35:54,695
A teenaged girl?

649
00:35:54,824 --> 00:35:55,663
I'll be right there.

650
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,130
Seems like maybe your dream was a day off.

651
00:36:00,453 --> 00:36:01,204
Anybody home?

652
00:36:03,021 --> 00:36:04,173
What's cookin', good lookin'?

653
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:04,987
Takeout.

654
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:07,497
Where's your mommy?

655
00:36:08,223 --> 00:36:09,026
Bathroom.

656
00:36:10,245 --> 00:36:11,040
Go away.

657
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,737
This time the girl was 13.

658
00:36:22,569 --> 00:36:24,736
I guess the doctor didn't have a scalpel

659
00:36:24,944 --> 00:36:28,604
because he used a rusty pair of scissors to cut her stomach open.

660
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:31,294
Then he used his bare hands to rip her apart.

661
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:33,752
Allison, it's not your fault.

662
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:34,832
Yeah, it was.

663
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,941
'Cause not only did I not save her,

664
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:38,723
I didn't have any of it right.

665
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:40,679
Her name wasn't Elisha.

666
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:42,322
Her name was Melissa James.

667
00:36:42,482 --> 00:36:44,402
She wasn't white. She was African-American.

668
00:36:44,513 --> 00:36:47,181
I had the wrong name, I had the wrong face,

669
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:49,434
I had the wrong damn date!

670
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:52,588
Allison, just because you didn't know exactly...

671
00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:55,138
Joe, I didn't know anything.

672
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:57,191
It was all for nothing.

673
00:36:58,568 --> 00:37:00,682
There's nobody left. There's nothing to learn.

674
00:37:00,862 --> 00:37:03,061
Somebody called security, the guard rushed in.

675
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,492
He shot the doctor.

676
00:37:05,163 --> 00:37:07,210
The girl was already dead.

677
00:37:07,948 --> 00:37:12,801
And that monster is still out there, looking for a new cipher, looking for a new helper.

678
00:37:12,904 --> 00:37:14,338
You mean looking for a new victim.

679
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:18,224
The doctors he uses, they're victims, too, aren't they?

680
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:23,483
You just told me that today a doctor-- a good man, probably, before all this happened--

681
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:26,699
did a horrible thing and died a terrible death because-- why?

682
00:37:26,775 --> 00:37:29,472
Because of some kind of a voice in his head.

683
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:30,927
I think you're right.

684
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:33,605
Thanks for pointing that out. Another meaningless victim.

685
00:37:33,804 --> 00:37:35,371
Well, what I'm trying to point out is,

686
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,351
where does all this leave that doctor from your dream?

687
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:41,422
I mean, if you think about it, he's the only victim that's still alive.

688
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:43,302
And he is a victim.

689
00:37:43,532 --> 00:37:46,660
'Cause here's a man who's spending the rest of his life in a mental institution

690
00:37:46,737 --> 00:37:48,407
because he's convinced he's insane,

691
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,645
or evil,

692
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,147
when in fact all he really is, if I understand you correctly,

693
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:56,190
is a little more... sensitive.

694
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:59,685
So, what are you going to do about him?

695
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,981
What do you want me to do about him?

696
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:05,215
Well, I should think at the very least, you owe him an explanation.

697
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:06,844
You want me to drive out there again?

698
00:38:06,941 --> 00:38:11,507
What makes you think that I won't find myself sitting across from Walker for the third time?

699
00:38:11,683 --> 00:38:13,608
I'm guessing Walker won't be there.

700
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,657
He's moved on.

701
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:16,198
He's done with Holloway.

702
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,690
And if I'm wrong, and Dr. Walker is there,

703
00:38:20,074 --> 00:38:23,571
then you'll have the satisfaction of looking him straight in the eye

704
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:25,163
and telling him to go...

705
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:30,575
Nice to see you again.

706
00:38:32,593 --> 00:38:34,676
It's our fourth time actually.

707
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,118
Dr. McGrath told me that you've been experiencing some "lost time" recently,

708
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:44,434
and that you didn't remember our last few encounters.

709
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,845
Mrs. Dubois, I am obviously a terribly ill man.

710
00:38:57,948 --> 00:39:02,541
If I have done or said anything to offend you,

711
00:39:02,622 --> 00:39:04,317
I am profoundly sorry.

712
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:05,684
It's all right.

713
00:39:05,884 --> 00:39:06,842
I understand.

714
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:10,206
You really weren't yourself.

715
00:39:12,648 --> 00:39:16,150
Which is what I came here to talk to you about.

716
00:39:20,676 --> 00:39:22,284
You've all been very helpful.

717
00:39:22,671 --> 00:39:25,397
This whole situation has been so hard.

718
00:39:47,432 --> 00:39:48,359
I've been, um...

719
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:50,724
I don't want to....

720
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,017
Please don't...

721
00:39:54,554 --> 00:39:55,830
I don't want...

722
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,524
- Elisha?
- Please don't...

723
00:40:04,881 --> 00:40:06,024
Found me, eh?

724
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:10,426
Nice to see you.

725
00:40:11,266 --> 00:40:13,627
I could do with a little adult company.

726
00:40:15,568 --> 00:40:16,904
She's 14.

727
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:22,295
Her head's filled with awful music and the silliest ideas.

728
00:40:22,602 --> 00:40:24,204
Get out of her head.

729
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,437
Not going to happen.

730
00:40:27,296 --> 00:40:28,942
You're too late.

731
00:40:29,033 --> 00:40:30,226
No, I don't think so.

732
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:32,254
In fact, I think I'm right on time.

733
00:40:34,138 --> 00:40:36,616
She wasn't your next victim at all, was she?

734
00:40:37,716 --> 00:40:39,385
She's your new apprentice.

735
00:40:39,817 --> 00:40:41,336
Smart as a whip, too.

736
00:40:41,721 --> 00:40:44,838
Going to make a wonderful physician once we convince everybody

737
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,113
that she's fine and get her out of here.

738
00:40:48,997 --> 00:40:51,194
Times have caught up with me, I'm afraid.

739
00:40:52,842 --> 00:40:54,998
The types of girls I want to ravage...

740
00:40:56,618 --> 00:40:59,001
they just don't go to male doctors anymore.

741
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,375
You know what they say:

742
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:03,461
adapt or die.

743
00:41:04,904 --> 00:41:06,123
Or, in my case,

744
00:41:06,921 --> 00:41:07,628
don't.

745
00:41:08,388 --> 00:41:09,712
You don't understand.

746
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:12,196
I'm not going to let this happen.

747
00:41:12,396 --> 00:41:15,543
No, you're the one who doesn't understand.

748
00:41:16,138 --> 00:41:17,720
It's already happened.

749
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:21,873
Oh, I know she's strong.

750
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:23,347
She's fighting me...

751
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:27,427
but I have nothing but time.

752
00:41:28,535 --> 00:41:32,025
And in the end, I'll win.

753
00:41:32,132 --> 00:41:33,495
You don't get it, do you?

754
00:41:34,068 --> 00:41:37,720
You only win because the people whose minds you seize

755
00:41:37,807 --> 00:41:39,783
don't understand what's happening to them.

756
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:42,812
They live in fear and confusion.

757
00:41:43,064 --> 00:41:44,974
But I will come here every day.

758
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:48,415
I will help Elisha understand that she's not going crazy.

759
00:41:48,948 --> 00:41:52,337
I will teach her not to be in fear of you but to hate you,

760
00:41:52,485 --> 00:41:54,846
to see you for what you really are--

761
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,636
a pathetic and evil soul

762
00:41:57,718 --> 00:41:59,332
who has no place to go,

763
00:41:59,899 --> 00:42:01,225
an interloper,

764
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,690
a parasite.

765
00:42:03,279 --> 00:42:05,178
If you think she's fighting you now...

766
00:42:06,851 --> 00:42:09,361
You may have all the time in the world,

767
00:42:09,484 --> 00:42:12,540
but how much of it are you willing to waste on a lost cause?

768
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:16,453
Because Elisha is lost to you.

769
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:19,146
I'll just find another one, you know.

770
00:42:20,025 --> 00:42:25,110
Why, there are three or four potentials that I'm monitoring right now.

771
00:42:25,186 --> 00:42:27,615
But you can't have her.

772
00:42:28,776 --> 00:42:30,804
You're going to leave her.

773
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:33,215
Do you understand?

774
00:42:35,356 --> 00:42:37,952
Do you understand what I'm saying?!

775
00:42:39,027 --> 00:42:40,067
Tell me!

776
00:42:47,915 --> 00:42:48,750
Elisha?

777
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:51,484
I don't hear him.

778
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,365
I don't hear him at all.

779
00:42:57,162 --> 00:42:59,250
I don't hear anything inside except...

780
00:43:01,963 --> 00:43:02,834
me.

781
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:14,738
