1
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:19,009
Excuse me.

2
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:22,050
Can you give me a hand?
I'm looking for Scofield Road.

3
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:24,493
The map says it's near
the rock quarry.

4
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:33,652
Thanks for the help.

5
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:44,453
Hello?

6
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:49,466
Hello? Anybody back there?

7
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:15,686
I told her...

8
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,099
I told Leanne we couldn't live
without each other.

9
00:01:24,272 --> 00:01:26,252
But she wouldn't come back to me.

10
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:30,172
No, no. Wait...

11
00:01:45,787 --> 00:01:47,956
Nice to see you again, Mrs. Dubois.

12
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:50,644
I hope I didn't frighten you.

13
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:52,064
Agent Cooper?

14
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:53,875
What are you doing here?

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,340
I told you I never
want to see you again.

16
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,020
Actually,
I'm here to make a peace offering.

17
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:03,408
Did you ever hear of a murderer
nicknamed "The Gentleman Caller"?

18
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,375
Abducted five young
women back in the 1980s?

19
00:02:06,922 --> 00:02:08,173
Never was caught.

20
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,936
For a while now, the police have assumed
that he's either dead or in prison

21
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:14,280
on some unrelated crime.

22
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,517
They're wrong.

23
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:20,788
The Gentleman Caller
is very much alive.

24
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,935
Would you like his name and address?

25
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:29,773
- What are you doing?
- I told you,

26
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,510
I'm attempting to make amends.

27
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,030
His name is Kyle Hawkins.

28
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,266
Kyle Hawkins?

29
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,477
When he would finish
with his victims,

30
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,326
he liked to bury them
on the edge of Phoenix.

31
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:48,420
The only problem is,

32
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:50,606
a housing development is going up
at that location.

33
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:52,424
They're breaking ground in a week.

34
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:57,118
Tonight he's going to dig up
the remains of his girls

35
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,162
and move them to a safer place.

36
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:01,510
If you instruct the police

37
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:04,642
to go to the very end of
Gayley Hill Drive

38
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,625
at approximately 8:30,
you'll catch him in the act.

39
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:13,572
No ambiguity, Mrs. Dubois,
no room for deception.

40
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,380
Kyle Hawkins...

41
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,750
www.sub-way.fr
www.seriessub.com

42
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,735
Kyle Hawkins?

43
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,682
That's what Agent Cooper
said his name was.

44
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:19,425
Agent Cooper.
Tips from the dead.

45
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:22,928
Well, he was one of
the FBI's best profilers.

46
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:24,818
Emphasis on the "was."

47
00:04:24,943 --> 00:04:26,997
Look, I don't know how
seriously to take this either.

48
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:29,972
The man certainly had no
problem lying to me in the past.

49
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:32,646
On the other hand,
if what he's saying is the truth...

50
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:37,110
I suppose we can spare
a couple of squad cars tonight.

51
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,312
In the meantime, I'll see what I can
find out about this Hawkins fellow.

52
00:04:40,437 --> 00:04:42,656
See if there actually is
a Hawkins fellow.

53
00:04:44,427 --> 00:04:47,113
- Is there something else?
- Actually, there is.

54
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:52,318
Just before I discovered Agent Cooper
in my kitchen, I had a dream about...

55
00:04:52,562 --> 00:04:54,975
I guess you could
call it a massacre.

56
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,489
It happened at a place
called Mike's Diner.

57
00:04:57,614 --> 00:05:00,364
Armed gunman went in,
shot everybody inside.

58
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:03,500
I'm not sure where Mike's Diner is,
other than...

59
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,120
it may be near a place
called Scofield Road,

60
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:08,662
which is supposed to be
near a rock quarry.

61
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:12,518
I have no idea when it happened,
or if it's happened yet,

62
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:15,147
but it seemed to have occurred
during the daytime.

63
00:05:15,272 --> 00:05:17,983
Mike's Diner,
Scofield Road, rock quarry.

64
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,570
And the shooter was upset
with his girlfriend...

65
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,957
his ex-girlfriend... Leanne.

66
00:05:23,164 --> 00:05:24,406
She works there.

67
00:05:25,286 --> 00:05:26,686
One serial killer,

68
00:05:27,142 --> 00:05:30,003
one diner massacre... got it.

69
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:31,651
Anything else?

70
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,941
Thanks for coming all the way
to the airport to see me.

71
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,868
Of course, you're the boss.

72
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:39,422
Happy to do it.

73
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:42,803
What brings you to Phoenix?

74
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:44,593
Oh, refuel on the way to Japan.

75
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:46,287
Oh. Cheers.

76
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:51,517
I realized I had
a whole 45 minutes here.

77
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,227
Thought maybe I'd use it
to talk to you about staffing.

78
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:55,569
Staffing?

79
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,095
I want to hit you with a name.

80
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:00,521
Hal Munzell.

81
00:06:02,657 --> 00:06:05,278
<i>After 20 years an arrest
has finally been made</i>

82
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:07,616
<i>in the notorious
"Gentleman Caller" murders.</i>

83
00:06:07,883 --> 00:06:10,308
<i>Police, acting on an anonymous tip,</i>

84
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:13,141
<i>discovered Kyle Hawkins
digging a hole...</i>

85
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:14,456
Can you believe that?

86
00:06:14,712 --> 00:06:16,917
- What's that?
- Kyle Hawkins.

87
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,662
He was exactly where Agent Cooper said
he would be.

88
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:22,771
Doing exactly what Cooper said
he'd be doing.

89
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:26,468
Maybe he really is sorry.
Maybe he meant what he said.

90
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:27,878
Maybe.

91
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:32,901
Come on. I just helped solve
a 20-year-old murder case.

92
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,813
I'm sorry. I just can't understand why
Terry is so impressed with this guy.

93
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:40,816
This is the most unspectacular
resume I've ever seen.

94
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:44,445
Didn't you already call him,
ask him to come in?

95
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,650
Well, I left him a message.

96
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,084
What choice did I have?

97
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:53,219
Who knows, with any luck,
maybe he won't get back to me.

98
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:55,624
I guess I spoke too soon.

99
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,750
Nope, I don't think so.
I think it's mine.

100
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:04,423
Hello.

101
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:07,500
I'm guessing you're the reason
our esteemed D.A. sent me out here

102
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,344
to visit Mike's Diner.

103
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,333
You're kidding.
You're out there?

104
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,514
<i>I just left.</i>

105
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:15,617
<i>Had some excellent chicken pot pie,
too, by the way.</i>

106
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:16,997
So everything's okay?

107
00:07:17,122 --> 00:07:19,354
<i>Well, it depends
how you define okay.</i>

108
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,497
<i>That waitress you told Manny about,
Leanne, she's fine.</i>

109
00:07:22,804 --> 00:07:24,513
<i>So are all the people at the diner.</i>

110
00:07:24,638 --> 00:07:26,111
That's terrific news.

111
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,874
Yeah, well, hold that thought.

112
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:33,440
You don't happen to be anywhere
near a computer, do you? 'Cause...

113
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:35,287
I'm about to send you an e-mail.

114
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:38,019
<i>There.</i>

115
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:39,770
<i>This guy look familiar?</i>

116
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:42,226
Hold on,
I'm just getting the e-mail open.

117
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:48,884
Oh, my God.

118
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,553
This the guy you saw massacre
everyone at that diner?

119
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:54,890
Everything all right?

120
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,810
<i>I'm going to take that for a yes.
The guy's name was Adam Dietz.</i>

121
00:07:58,065 --> 00:08:01,444
Leanne gave us his address.
I guess the two of them are an item.

122
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:03,260
No, were an item.

123
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:05,963
Apparently she left him
after he lost his job.

124
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:08,529
Poor guy was about
to lose his house, too.

125
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:12,200
<i>Even left a handy suicide note,
lest there'd be any confusion</i>

126
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,279
<i>about what he did or why he did it.</i>

127
00:08:14,404 --> 00:08:17,704
So he never even went over there?
He never threatened anyone at all?

128
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:19,263
Nope.

129
00:08:19,388 --> 00:08:21,043
Hey, that's the good news.

130
00:08:21,555 --> 00:08:23,627
Looks like the only life
this guy took was his own.

131
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,099
<i>I guess we'll compare
notes in the morning?</i>

132
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:27,224
I guess.

133
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,857
No, wait, I don't want to do this.
Don't make me do this.

134
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:48,492
Fine.
Shall I shoot you in the groin now?

135
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:51,382
Adam, we talked about this.

136
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:54,288
Either you hang yourself
or I shoot you six times.

137
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:56,496
First shot in the groin.
We wait ten minutes.

138
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,992
Second shot in the eye.
We wait another ten.

139
00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:01,900
- Third shot in the Adam's apple...
- All right, all right, I'm sorry!

140
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:03,075
Never mind!

141
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:09,492
Now jump.

142
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,413
Please, no, I don't think I can.
Don't make me do this.

143
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:16,227
- I can't do this.
- You can do it, Adam, it's easy.

144
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:18,619
Please, no!
Don't make me do this!

145
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:33,178
Hi. Can I help you?

146
00:09:34,061 --> 00:09:36,867
Hal Munzell. I received your message
on my voice mail.

147
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,411
Oh, right, yeah.
I asked you to call me.

148
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:41,830
I know.
I thought this might be better.

149
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:44,609
Oh, well, to be honest,

150
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:47,389
I prefer to sort of set aside
some time and, you know...

151
00:09:47,514 --> 00:09:49,064
Is this a bad moment?

152
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:50,839
Have you got an appointment?

153
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:53,219
Am I disrupting something?

154
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,004
No, it's all right. You're fine.

155
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,388
Have a seat, Mr. Mun... Munzal?

156
00:09:59,054 --> 00:09:59,890
Munzell.

157
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:01,339
Munzell.

158
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:03,617
Okay.

159
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:08,023
All right, yeah, I was looking...
I was looking at your résumé last night.

160
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,241
Here we go.

161
00:10:13,355 --> 00:10:15,889
Well, I see that you moved
around quite a little bit.

162
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:19,201
You don't seem to stay in one place for
very long and I just was curious why.

163
00:10:20,681 --> 00:10:24,382
I suppose that over time, I find
that I don't much like my colleagues,

164
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:27,334
or perhaps they find
that they don't much like me.

165
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:35,913
My boss, Terry Cavanaugh,
he took a real shine to you.

166
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,762
Where did you two meet?

167
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:40,736
We were at a conference.

168
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,557
He made a pass
at the woman I was with.

169
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:48,649
Okay.

170
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:54,786
I... I'm just starting to meet people,
and I see you're at...

171
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:57,471
at Taylor-Hammond in Houston,
which is good,

172
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:00,175
because it may be a while
before I figure out

173
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,577
exactly which way I'm gonna go
with this position.

174
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:06,081
You know, listen,
when I was on the plane with Terry...

175
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,439
- You were on the plane with Terry?
- He mentioned you were struggling

176
00:11:09,564 --> 00:11:12,296
with the dye sensitizer mechanisms
in your solar cell.

177
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:15,123
And I put some thought into it,
and I came up with some ideas.

178
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:17,287
Thought maybe you would
like to take a look.

179
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:19,187
I don't know what to tell you,
Allison.

180
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:22,468
- It just didn't look like a murder.
- It may not, but I'm telling you,

181
00:11:22,593 --> 00:11:24,482
that man was forced
to put that rope.

182
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:27,632
And what about the note the guy left?
He was forced to write that, too?

183
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:29,646
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.

184
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,417
Allison,
look at the physical evidence.

185
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:36,846
There were no signs of forced entry, no
signs of struggle, no defensive wounds.

186
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:39,833
And it's not like the guy didn't
have a reason to do what he did.

187
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,908
Allison,
what is it you'd like me to do?

188
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:44,915
The only description you've given me is,
the guy was wearing a hoodie.

189
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,706
Do I haul in every male in the Phoenix
metro area who owns a hoodie?

190
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:51,865
And need I remind you that just 24 hours
ago, you told me you saw the victim...

191
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,758
the exact same guy I saw swinging
from a rafter last night...

192
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:56,340
massacre a diner full of people?

193
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:59,722
I'm sorry, no offense, but you're not
on your A game here, lady.

194
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:02,280
I think maybe you just need
to take a step back.

195
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:05,355
You'd be hard-pressed to find
a more unlikable human being.

196
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,985
- Don't hire him.
- I wouldn't, except for two things.

197
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,863
My boss is championing the guy,
and these drawings are amazing.

198
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,908
- What do you mean?
- Well, look,

199
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,834
I couldn't figure out why Terry
would have anything to do with him,

200
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,403
but now I look at the work,
I totally get it.

201
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:22,340
I mean, this guy really
is a spectacular thinker.

202
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:26,288
His solution for our dye sensitizer
problems really are amazing.

203
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:29,094
I mean,
I don't think I have a choice.

204
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:32,681
Okay, that's it. It's done.

205
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:34,926
What's done?

206
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:37,977
I just wrote Terry and told him
I'm hiring his friend.

207
00:12:38,602 --> 00:12:40,461
And then, I e-mailed Hal.

208
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:44,158
Told him I'd be interested in having
him start as soon as possible.

209
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:46,263
You really are a man of action.

210
00:12:46,388 --> 00:12:48,929
No, I just know
the inevitable when I see it.

211
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:52,561
Besides, you don't have to...

212
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:55,321
like everyone you work with, right?

213
00:12:55,868 --> 00:12:57,758
I'm trying to build a company,

214
00:12:57,883 --> 00:12:59,213
not start a club.

215
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,638
Spoken like a true
captain of industry.

216
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:07,119
Which is great, 'cause it might
just be time for me to retire.

217
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:09,387
What are you talking about?

218
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,227
Well, I don't know.
It seems more and more lately,

219
00:13:12,352 --> 00:13:16,107
the things that I see, the things
that I dream, there's not a lot to them.

220
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,458
If that's the case,
what's the point?

221
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:36,355
Is this sleeplessness

222
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,840
a product of your excitement over
the capture of the Gentleman Caller?

223
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,709
Congratulations.

224
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:44,175
No, thank you.

225
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:47,325
We both know it wouldn't have
happened without your help.

226
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,537
I'm just pleased that we've finally
begun to repair our relationship.

227
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:55,803
You gave me some good information,
and I'm grateful,

228
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:59,384
but I wouldn't call this...
this association a relationship.

229
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:04,482
Michael Bradley.

230
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,933
Who's Michael Bradley?

231
00:14:12,323 --> 00:14:16,062
A serial rapist with a predilection
for women with blonde hair.

232
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:19,052
He's struck four times
over the last 18 months.

233
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:21,943
Two of his victims were
high school students.

234
00:14:22,908 --> 00:14:25,354
The last girl
that he attacked fought back.

235
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,698
And the police were able
to recover a hair sample.

236
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,943
If they could locate this man
and procure some of his DNA,

237
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,584
I think that they would find
a perfect match.

238
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:41,373
Convicting him would be
a relatively simple matter.

239
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:43,792
Tell me, Mrs. Dubois.

240
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,114
Would you like his home address?

241
00:15:11,234 --> 00:15:12,077
I can't.

242
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:14,679
You have to.

243
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,633
But I don't understand.

244
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:19,976
You're just a boy.

245
00:15:27,371 --> 00:15:28,371
Allison...

246
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,245
this police report is crystal clear.

247
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,765
Three weeks ago, Rachel Stetson
took her own life, period.

248
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,527
- End of story.
- She was forced to inject herself,

249
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:39,056
just like that man was forced
to hang himself.

250
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:40,281
By some boy?

251
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:42,944
She was being treated
for chronic depression...

252
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:45,616
she even said as much in the note
she left for her husband.

253
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:48,012
I think the boy told
her what to write.

254
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:51,925
I'll play along.
So, there's this teenager.

255
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:55,629
He can get in and out of houses
and apartments without leaving

256
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,956
any sign of forced entry.

257
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,833
And without firing a single shot,

258
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,518
he can convince people two,
three times his own age

259
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:06,423
to take their own lives without putting
up a struggle. Forget how... why?

260
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:09,436
I don't know.

261
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:14,014
I'm not trying to embarrass you.

262
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:17,859
What would you like me to do?
I can't really assign a detective,

263
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:20,595
because no actual crimes
have been reported.

264
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:23,809
I could put you
with a composite artist, but...

265
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,592
once we have a sketch,
what would we do with it?

266
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:28,927
If you had a name, I could have
someone interview the kid,

267
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:32,043
at least determine where he was on the
nights in question, but without a name,

268
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:33,718
I'm really at a loss.

269
00:16:34,082 --> 00:16:35,132
You know...

270
00:16:35,918 --> 00:16:38,685
the detective assigned
to the youth crimes task force...

271
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,389
he keeps an up-to-date collection of all
the high school yearbooks

272
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:42,914
in the metro area.

273
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:46,366
Maybe you could flip through those,
see if you could find his picture,

274
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:47,505
get a name.

275
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,166
Thank you. I'd like that.

276
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:53,736
Here, sorry. I almost forgot.

277
00:16:58,588 --> 00:17:01,269
"Michael Bradley,
1714 Andover Lane."

278
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:03,168
Forgive me, what is this?

279
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:05,757
That's the address for the serial rapist
you've been looking for,

280
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:07,817
the one who likes
blonde high school girls.

281
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:11,623
- Really, is this something you dreamed?
- No.

282
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,393
But I think
it's reliable information.

283
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:16,769
I had nothing to do with it.

284
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:19,554
Dad?

285
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:21,914
Hey. Everything okay?

286
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:23,679
I don't know.

287
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,675
Where did you get these?

288
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:27,632
These?

289
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,174
A fellow who came in looking
for a job gave them to me... why?

290
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,130
I know this is gonna sound strange,

291
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:36,773
but I think I had a dream
about them last night.

292
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:37,998
About these?

293
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,974
About schematics?

294
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,063
I pretty much put it out of my head

295
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:44,403
until I saw them sitting
on your laptop just now.

296
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:45,885
Okay, what about them?

297
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,149
I can't imagine they'd
make much of a dream.

298
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:50,217
Well, they didn't really.

299
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:54,840
There was this guy, and he was standing
in the middle of nothing

300
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:56,596
with some papers in his hand.

301
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:58,603
And he kept screaming,
"These are mine.

302
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:01,371
"Tell your father these are mine.
They belong to Clay."

303
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,134
The police haven't arrested
Michael Bradley yet.

304
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:17,065
You scared me.

305
00:18:18,051 --> 00:18:20,853
They're staking out his apartment.
They'll pick him up soon.

306
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:22,434
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

307
00:18:22,906 --> 00:18:26,287
I overheard Bradley's brother
tip him off about the stakeout.

308
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,171
Now he's hiding
at a friend's apartment.

309
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:31,526
It's on the corner of
Western and Del Mar.

310
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,375
Wait a second.

311
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,000
Western and Del Mar?

312
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,814
Thank you. I'll pass that along.

313
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:42,245
What's with this sudden
fascination with high school boys?

314
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:46,402
I'm looking for this killer
that I've been dreaming about.

315
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,311
I think he goes to this high school.

316
00:18:49,943 --> 00:18:52,945
I can't question him. I can't go
in the school and ask about him.

317
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,520
I have no evidence.

318
00:18:54,928 --> 00:18:57,802
Just wanted to see him in the flesh,
make sure I was right.

319
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:00,217
What do you mean, no evidence?

320
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:01,973
There's always evidence.

321
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:05,310
If there is murder, slaughter
of some kind, there's evidence.

322
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:07,578
No, you're wrong. He's very clever.

323
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:09,413
He makes it look like suicide.

324
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:10,538
Really?

325
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,467
You indicated that he was
a serial offender.

326
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,030
Serial offenders are,
by their nature, peacocks.

327
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:20,450
They almost never
disguise their crimes.

328
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:22,644
They want
their activities written about.

329
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:25,789
They want their personas
speculated about.

330
00:19:26,935 --> 00:19:28,673
I'm sorry, Mrs. Dubois.

331
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:30,835
I'm skeptical.

332
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:34,631
You're not alone.

333
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:43,427
Pretty raw.

334
00:19:44,687 --> 00:19:46,187
Kind of interesting.

335
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,681
So, what is it you want to show me?

336
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:55,863
What's so damned important?

337
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,262
What's this?

338
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:03,166
What am I looking at?

339
00:20:03,392 --> 00:20:06,532
It's an obituary for a...
a guy named Clay Barrett.

340
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:08,841
37... he was young.

341
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:10,834
What's this got to do with me?

342
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,968
He died four months ago
of a brain aneurysm.

343
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:15,226
Before that,
he worked at Taylor-Hammond.

344
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,329
He was something of a wunderkind.

345
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:21,458
He taught grad seminars on
the dye sensitization of solar cells

346
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,530
when he was an undergraduate,
when he was, like, a sophomore.

347
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:29,285
Now, Hal Munzell shared
an office with him for two years.

348
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,508
I know you're very excited
about Hal's designs,

349
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:34,523
but I'm worried
they might not be his.

350
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,115
That's a serious accusation, Joe.

351
00:20:42,252 --> 00:20:44,952
Who's making it?
Somebody at Taylor-Hammond?

352
00:20:45,268 --> 00:20:48,168
Actually, my source did work
at Taylor-Hammond.

353
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:51,791
- Did?
- He longer works there.

354
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:57,959
I didn't actually talk to him myself.
He reached out through somebody that...

355
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:02,636
that I'm very close to,
somebody that I really trust.

356
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,090
Fine.

357
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:08,381
- Can you give me a name?
- I'd rather not.

358
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,920
Is there any proof,
anything to back this story up?

359
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:15,045
No.

360
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:18,212
But like I said,
this is somebody that I trust.

361
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:19,235
A lot.

362
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,910
I'm sorry, maybe you trust
this person, but...

363
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,930
I don't think I could let a man go
on the say-so of...

364
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:31,289
some unnamed,
disgruntled former colleague.

365
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,213
- It's not like that.
- It's exactly like that.

366
00:21:35,313 --> 00:21:37,955
According to you, this person couldn't
even screw up enough courage

367
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,084
to make the accusation in person.
Had to go through some third party.

368
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,352
Frankly, Joe,

369
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,666
I'm surprised you'd waste my time
with this.

370
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:55,486
Terry,
you know about my wife, right?

371
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,443
You telling me you got
this idea from your wife?

372
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,237
No, actually,
it came from my daughter.

373
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:08,345
I'm tired.

374
00:22:08,668 --> 00:22:11,360
I've been on a plane all day.
I'm still not home.

375
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,041
So I shouldn't care
that he might be a thief?

376
00:22:17,356 --> 00:22:19,440
Hey, I'd care if you could prove it.

377
00:22:19,825 --> 00:22:20,838
But you can't.

378
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:24,052
You don't want Hal
on your team, fine.

379
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:26,653
All you have to do
is to beat his idea.

380
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,584
Save me more time,
save me more money.

381
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:31,929
If you can't do that...

382
00:22:40,344 --> 00:22:43,131
You forgot to clean
the outside of the cylinder.

383
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:45,989
Remember how I showed you?

384
00:22:47,506 --> 00:22:49,252
Congratulations, by the way.

385
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:53,327
You followed
my instructions to the T.

386
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:57,081
Apparently, there's not a shred

387
00:22:57,206 --> 00:23:00,856
of physical evidence to tie you
to the deaths of these people.

388
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:03,856
That's impressive.

389
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,710
That's...

390
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:07,817
very impressive.

391
00:23:08,497 --> 00:23:10,846
And the way you slipped in

392
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:13,737
and out of that house
and that woman's apartment.

393
00:23:14,315 --> 00:23:16,519
You have a real talent
for this line of work.

394
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,326
I keep thinking about them, though.

395
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,132
Both of them.

396
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:28,975
The way they pleaded for their lives,
you know, the looks on their faces.

397
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:31,639
The guy was so scared.
That woman...

398
00:23:34,502 --> 00:23:35,725
she was so sad.

399
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:37,415
That will pass,

400
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:41,205
but the accomplishment will live on,

401
00:23:42,898 --> 00:23:46,682
and that's what you need to revel in,
young man, the accomplishment.

402
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:49,703
If you hadn't done what you did,

403
00:23:50,573 --> 00:23:53,101
that man would have gotten up
the next morning, gone to that diner

404
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:55,349
and snuffed out all those lives.

405
00:23:56,232 --> 00:23:59,399
Saving seven or eight innocent souls

406
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:02,620
in the return for the death
of one sociopath...

407
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,446
I'd say that's a pretty good trade.

408
00:24:13,737 --> 00:24:16,592
If you're calling the police,
I wouldn't bother.

409
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:20,899
By the time they were able
to search young Brandon's home,

410
00:24:21,865 --> 00:24:23,865
the weapon would be long gone.

411
00:24:25,836 --> 00:24:27,386
How long did it take,

412
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:30,407
once you realized he was sensitive,

413
00:24:30,532 --> 00:24:32,473
that he could see you, hear you?

414
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,389
How long did it take?

415
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:38,376
What's the difference?

416
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:41,483
I need someone to help me,

417
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,084
and you were unwilling.

418
00:24:44,356 --> 00:24:45,506
He's a child!

419
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:48,852
You've got him killing for you!

420
00:24:51,642 --> 00:24:54,033
- You're a monster.
- I'm a monster?

421
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:55,962
What about Adam Dietz?

422
00:24:56,541 --> 00:25:00,215
You dreamt about what he was prepared
to do to everyone in that diner.

423
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,793
And Rachel Stetson, that woman
that you saw injecting herself.

424
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:06,629
Did you know that she was a nurse?

425
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:11,259
Perhaps you also heard
that she was struggling with depression.

426
00:25:12,315 --> 00:25:14,288
But what you couldn't
have been aware of

427
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:17,154
was her growing sense of despair

428
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:20,267
over the deterioration
of the health care system

429
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:21,653
she labored in.

430
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,804
She had actually become convinced

431
00:25:25,363 --> 00:25:28,641
that death might just be preferable

432
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:31,726
to the level of care
that she was able to provide.

433
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,097
So convinced

434
00:25:33,903 --> 00:25:35,153
that if Brandon

435
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:38,317
had not done
what I had asked him to do,

436
00:25:38,442 --> 00:25:41,594
she would have secretly
and purposefully euthanised

437
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:44,458
16 patients before she was caught!

438
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,661
We are talking about a child!

439
00:25:46,786 --> 00:25:49,628
- It cannot continue!
- It must continue!

440
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:52,405
You and I...

441
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,984
have done a lot of good together
over the past few days.

442
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,223
We have put some terrible people
in prison.

443
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:02,049
That can continue, Mrs. Dubois.

444
00:26:02,872 --> 00:26:06,272
I'll keep sharing information with you,
good information,

445
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,049
but only...

446
00:26:08,685 --> 00:26:11,435
if you allow my other work
to go on unimpeded.

447
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,595
That's what this is all about,
isn't it?

448
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:17,825
You knew I was dreaming
about you and the boy.

449
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:21,046
That's why you came to see me
in the first place.

450
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,532
Did you actually think

451
00:26:23,657 --> 00:26:25,924
that if you gave me enough
information about criminals

452
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:29,545
we weren't able to catch, that I would
let you two keep murdering people?

453
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:34,445
Good night, Agent Cooper.

454
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,521
You won't be able to catch him.
You won't be able to stop him.

455
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:47,609
There'll be no evidence...
I'll make certain of that.

456
00:26:48,496 --> 00:26:50,187
I'm already in his head.

457
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:52,466
You can't save him.

458
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:54,931
There's virtually
no "him" left to save.

459
00:26:55,746 --> 00:26:57,196
Why not reconsider?

460
00:26:58,044 --> 00:27:00,082
It's such an elegant arrangement.

461
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,834
Promise me you'll sleep on it.

462
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,081
Hey, Hal.
When you're all settled in,

463
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:16,759
I'd like to go over your plans
for the dye sensitizer.

464
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:19,747
See if we can't tie
up a few loose ends.

465
00:27:21,582 --> 00:27:23,582
What's wrong with
the plans I gave you?

466
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:25,555
No, nothing. They helped a lot.

467
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,931
But we still need to figure out
how to get better absorption

468
00:27:28,056 --> 00:27:29,699
out of the semiconductor.

469
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:31,869
And we need to address the electron

470
00:27:31,994 --> 00:27:34,176
recombination in the mediator level.

471
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:46,422
May I?

472
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:07,237
What's going on, Hal?

473
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:14,077
I'm gonna be perfectly
honest with you, Joe.

474
00:28:15,502 --> 00:28:18,308
I'm not really
an office kind of a guy.

475
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:22,294
I tend to do
my very best work at my house.

476
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:23,957
There are fewer distractions there,

477
00:28:24,082 --> 00:28:26,691
I can really focus on the problems
that I need to solve, and...

478
00:28:26,816 --> 00:28:28,497
if it's all the same to you,
I'd like

479
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,999
to take these home with me
and noodle with them there,

480
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:33,169
and bring you my absolute best

481
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:34,993
as opposed to...

482
00:28:35,118 --> 00:28:37,263
whatever I can muster here.

483
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:49,185
Brandon?
Brandon Whitman?

484
00:28:49,768 --> 00:28:52,980
My name's Allison.
I'm friends with Agent Cooper.

485
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,748
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm nothing like you.

486
00:28:58,873 --> 00:29:00,523
You're exactly like me.

487
00:29:00,774 --> 00:29:02,548
You can see him, so can I.

488
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:05,284
The only difference is,
I don't kill for him.

489
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:19,131
Where is everybody?

490
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,909
"Everyone" is my mom.

491
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:26,988
Everyone's at work. And when not,
everyone's with her boyfriend.

492
00:29:29,514 --> 00:29:31,771
What do you want?
Why are you in my house?

493
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:34,345
I work for the district
attorney's office.

494
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:38,179
I want to help you.

495
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:42,989
- I don't need any help.
- Yes, you do.

496
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,615
- You could be tried for murder.
- I don't think so,

497
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:48,369
'cause all those people you keep
talking about, they killed themselves.

498
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,584
No, they decided to end
their lives quickly

499
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:53,526
rather than face the slow death
you were threatening.

500
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:54,959
Can you prove that?

501
00:30:01,724 --> 00:30:03,300
I'm offering you a way out.

502
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:06,429
Come with me
to the district attorney's office.

503
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:08,843
We will explain what happened.

504
00:30:09,472 --> 00:30:11,953
How you started hearing
Cooper's voice in your head.

505
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:15,062
How your mom tried to get you treatment
and medication, but it didn't work.

506
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,597
You're still a minor.

507
00:30:18,403 --> 00:30:20,403
The court will show you mercy.

508
00:30:21,345 --> 00:30:22,345
Mercy?

509
00:30:25,797 --> 00:30:27,697
They should give me a medal.

510
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,619
Do you know how many lives
I've saved?

511
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,493
I go to school,
I look at all the other kids.

512
00:30:33,618 --> 00:30:36,016
The captain of the team,
the girl who stars in all the plays,

513
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:37,883
and they're like the overachievers,

514
00:30:38,008 --> 00:30:40,572
the ones who get in all the good
colleges, that everybody talks about.

515
00:30:40,697 --> 00:30:43,051
What have they done?
Played a game, sang a song?

516
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:44,383
Look at what I do.

517
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:47,344
All the people in
that diner were going to die.

518
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,210
All the patients that woman cared for,
she was gonna kill.

519
00:30:50,335 --> 00:30:53,017
- And you're gonna stop us? Why?
- Because it's wrong.

520
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,573
But it's not wrong!

521
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:03,498
You know... 

522
00:31:04,867 --> 00:31:08,063
When he first started appearing
to me, I would ignore him,

523
00:31:08,852 --> 00:31:10,410
pretend I couldn't see.

524
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:14,263
He was screaming at me about
this guy in Scottsdale.

525
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:16,868
Said he was depressed
and was gonna take his .38

526
00:31:16,993 --> 00:31:20,279
and shoot his wife and two kids right
before he blew his own brains out.

527
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,606
Agent Cooper asked me if
I would do something about it.

528
00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:27,396
He said he'd show me how to get in
the house, what to say, what to do.

529
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,429
I just ignored him.

530
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,613
The next day, I wake up,
my mom's watching the news.

531
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:37,018
"Murder-suicide in Scottsdale."
Some guy snaps,

532
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:38,792
kills his whole family.

533
00:31:39,894 --> 00:31:41,480
I could have saved them.

534
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:42,775
No.

535
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:47,154
You know I'm right.

536
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:49,322
- No, I don't.
- It's like he always says,

537
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,107
"Just do the math."

538
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:54,353
You kill one guilty person,
you save two innocent ones.

539
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:56,192
You kill 20, you save a hundred.

540
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:58,641
You kill a hundred,
you save a thousand.

541
00:31:59,358 --> 00:32:01,176
- Do the math.
- This isn't math!

542
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,700
This is something else.

543
00:32:03,825 --> 00:32:06,090
It's vigilantism, and it's wrong.

544
00:32:06,434 --> 00:32:07,434
No,

545
00:32:08,421 --> 00:32:09,421
it isn't.

546
00:32:11,187 --> 00:32:12,846
It's really kind of perfect.

547
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:17,152
Anyway, you're gonna have to leave.
I have...

548
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,769
homework.

549
00:32:24,405 --> 00:32:26,078
Honey, you coming to bed?

550
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:28,813
Someday.

551
00:32:30,267 --> 00:32:31,609
What if you can't do it?

552
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:34,397
What if you can't come up with
a solution that improves on Hal's?

553
00:32:34,522 --> 00:32:37,173
Don't say that.
Don't even put that out there.

554
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:44,658
Maybe I should just surrender
and get used to the fact that Hal...

555
00:32:44,783 --> 00:32:46,259
thieving, slimy,

556
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,458
untrustworthy Hal is someone
I'm going to just have to see

557
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,428
every day of my professional life.

558
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:54,989
When and if he chooses
to come into the office, that is.

559
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:59,085
You all right if I stay
out here for a bit?

560
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,610
I'll see you soon.

561
00:33:04,465 --> 00:33:05,465
Daddy?

562
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:08,036
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

563
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:13,016
Ariel, what'd you... what's going on?
Everything all right?

564
00:33:13,552 --> 00:33:14,852
What time is it?

565
00:33:14,977 --> 00:33:17,663
- Oh, God. What are you doing up?
- I don't know.

566
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,396
It's like midnight or something.

567
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:24,207
I had another dream
about that Clay guy.

568
00:33:24,332 --> 00:33:25,961
He wanted me to tell you something.

569
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,130
Oh you did? What?

570
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:31,216
He wants you to look at something
called the Mellinger Equation.

571
00:33:31,557 --> 00:33:33,107
"Mellinger Equation"?

572
00:33:33,877 --> 00:33:36,027
- Do you mean Mallinger?
- Yeah.

573
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,858
He says you're supposed to "apply

574
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:43,016
"1-ethyl-3 and then extrapolate it
from four vectors".

575
00:33:43,141 --> 00:33:44,141
What?

576
00:33:44,561 --> 00:33:45,975
He kept screaming it at me,

577
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,436
until I promised I'd wake up
and write it down.

578
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,800
Why?

579
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,747
Why did you leave?

580
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,665
I just got off the phone
with the hospital again.

581
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,600
For the moment at least,
he's... he's still hanging on.

582
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:23,826
I'll keep you posted.

583
00:34:23,951 --> 00:34:25,299
I appreciate that.

584
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:29,795
It was in front of us the whole time,
Terry. We just didn't see it.

585
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,360
The Mallinger Equation.

586
00:34:32,014 --> 00:34:35,207
It really does solve all of
our dye sensitizer problems.

587
00:34:36,314 --> 00:34:39,934
The key is applying it
to a lighter photosensitive material,

588
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:43,265
and then applying Mallinger
to four additional surface vectors,

589
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:46,451
thereby reducing the amount of
external sensitization that's required.

590
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:49,982
Thereby reducing
our material costs by... what?

591
00:34:50,107 --> 00:34:51,717
Three, maybe four percent?

592
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:53,674
It might even go so high as five.

593
00:34:56,854 --> 00:34:58,354
What can I say, Joe?

594
00:34:59,483 --> 00:35:03,487
I guess I underestimated just how much
you dislike working with Hal Munzell.

595
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:05,867
Are you on board with this?

596
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,503
I'm a man of my word, Joe.

597
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:12,856
Consider him gone.

598
00:35:14,005 --> 00:35:17,705
Well, if he ever comes back in the
office, I'll be sure to let him know.

599
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:19,241
That's great, Joe.

600
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,229
Well, I guess sometimes things do
work out the way they're supposed to.

601
00:35:24,984 --> 00:35:26,554
Soon, I hope.

602
00:35:26,986 --> 00:35:30,024
They're still operating.
Devalos and I are just waiting.

603
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:34,832
Joe, I gotta go.

604
00:35:34,957 --> 00:35:36,998
Tell the girls
I'll be home in a bit.

605
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:43,015
Douglas Reilly just expired.

606
00:35:59,102 --> 00:36:02,605
"Dear Joe, I made a decision
to end my life tonight..."

607
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:04,594
Hello again, Mrs. Dubois.

608
00:36:06,854 --> 00:36:08,507
Nice note, don't you think?

609
00:36:08,807 --> 00:36:10,699
I'm going to need you to sign that.

610
00:36:10,824 --> 00:36:12,697
By the way, I'm have a gun
in my left hand

611
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:15,749
which is pointed directly
at the center of your spine.

612
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,955
A single bullet
at this close proximity,

613
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,067
even through the rear of your seat,

614
00:36:20,192 --> 00:36:22,147
should disable
but not kill you immediately,

615
00:36:22,272 --> 00:36:24,072
causing unimaginable pain.

616
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:27,920
- Brandon, don't do this.
- Sign the note,

617
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:30,920
put the key in the ignition
and drive to the roof.

618
00:36:47,882 --> 00:36:51,708
There are video cameras all over this
lot. You're being recorded right now.

619
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:54,273
Not tonight.
The system's down.

620
00:36:55,036 --> 00:36:56,689
Will be
until it's serviced tomorrow.

621
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,611
Agent Cooper is very thorough.
You ought to know that by now.

622
00:36:59,736 --> 00:37:02,177
Agent Cooper?
This was his idea?

623
00:37:03,123 --> 00:37:04,669
Our work is very important.

624
00:37:04,794 --> 00:37:06,979
We can't let you get in the way.

625
00:37:07,104 --> 00:37:09,704
Now, I'm going to need you
to climb up on that wall.

626
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:13,021
- I can't do that, Brandon.
- I think you will.

627
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:16,179
You're going to climb up on that wall,
and jump off it,

628
00:37:16,304 --> 00:37:18,861
'cause if you don't,
I will shoot you, Mrs. Dubois.

629
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,951
You're going to have to shoot me.

630
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:31,460
What's the matter?

631
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:34,620
Didn't Cooper tell
you this might happen?

632
00:37:34,745 --> 00:37:37,016
No he didn't, did he?
'Cause he didn't know.

633
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:39,422
Just like he didn't know
about Douglas Reilly.

634
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:44,140
Who... who's Douglas Reilly?

635
00:37:45,426 --> 00:37:46,835
I'm going to get...

636
00:37:51,586 --> 00:37:53,617
Douglas Reilly is a man who...

637
00:37:53,742 --> 00:37:55,885
actually did commit suicide
last night,

638
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,760
and not because anybody
was threatening him,

639
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,920
but because he lost his wife,

640
00:38:02,451 --> 00:38:06,121
and he couldn't imagine spending
another day without her.

641
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:08,057
See him?

642
00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:12,107
His wife's name was Rachel Stetson.

643
00:38:20,774 --> 00:38:24,009
His wife was a killer.
So, it's like Cooper says. Do the math.

644
00:38:24,327 --> 00:38:26,082
No, no, no. You do the math.

645
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,303
His wife hadn't killed anybody.

646
00:38:30,256 --> 00:38:31,699
Anybody. Not yet.

647
00:38:31,824 --> 00:38:34,520
And I'm starting to think
she probably never would have.

648
00:38:36,297 --> 00:38:37,955
Wait a second.
What are you saying?

649
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,524
I'm saying, honey,
the future isn't fixed.

650
00:38:40,649 --> 00:38:42,643
It isn't certain.
It is fluid.

651
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,296
Agent Cooper

652
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:48,241
couldn't have known that Rachel Stetson
was going to kill all those people.

653
00:38:48,737 --> 00:38:51,147
Or that somebody wouldn't
have discovered her.

654
00:38:51,272 --> 00:38:53,776
Or that she wouldn't have
had a change of heart.

655
00:38:53,901 --> 00:38:55,623
Any more he could
have been certain that

656
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:59,714
Adam Dietz was going to walk into
that diner and blow everyone away.

657
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:03,360
Who's to say that somebody
wouldn't have stopped him?

658
00:39:03,485 --> 00:39:06,417
Who's to say that he wouldn't
have stopped himself?

659
00:39:09,531 --> 00:39:11,214
No, he saw it.
He, he knew it.

660
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,684
He was certain of it.
He even said you dreamt about it.

661
00:39:14,092 --> 00:39:15,079
I did.

662
00:39:15,204 --> 00:39:16,204
I did.

663
00:39:16,757 --> 00:39:19,587
My dreams are always,
always fooling with me.

664
00:39:19,712 --> 00:39:21,770
You can... you can call my husband.

665
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:25,429
- Call the people I work with.
- So what are you saying?

666
00:39:25,554 --> 00:39:26,655
I'm saying...

667
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:29,275
do the math, Brandon.

668
00:39:30,624 --> 00:39:32,074
Cooper's using you.

669
00:39:32,905 --> 00:39:36,289
He wants you to think
that he's infallible, but he isn't.

670
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,084
I am never

671
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,253
gonna jump off that wall.

672
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:44,673
So, you're gonna have to kill me.

673
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:48,675
Or better yet,

674
00:39:49,669 --> 00:39:50,995
give me that gun.

675
00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:54,444
Give me the gun,
we're going to get back in the car,

676
00:39:54,569 --> 00:39:56,219
we'll drive downstairs,

677
00:39:56,344 --> 00:39:57,633
we'll talk to my boss.

678
00:39:57,758 --> 00:40:00,480
That's just not an option,
Mrs. Dubois.

679
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:03,350
We don't have much time.
Pull the trigger.

680
00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:06,054
We'll drive the car away,
leave her here,

681
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:07,738
make it look like a carjacking.

682
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,447
Is what she's saying right?

683
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:13,837
Is it possible I forced those people
to kill themselves for no reason at all?

684
00:40:13,962 --> 00:40:15,824
It's highly unlikely, Brandon.

685
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:20,363
And we could hardly afford to wait
and just let awful things happen.

686
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:22,544
That would've defeated
our entire purpose.

687
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:25,964
Now pull the trigger.

688
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,841
You said she was going to jump!

689
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,738
Give me the gun, Brandon.

690
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:31,463
If you don't kill her,

691
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,135
she will arrest you.

692
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,058
- And you will go to prison.
- I told you, we'll go talk to my boss.

693
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:39,227
I believe that he will recommend
that the court show you mercy.

694
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,306
I wouldn't count on mercy, son.

695
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:44,191
You've already had a hand
in the deaths of three people.

696
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,195
Now pull the trigger!

697
00:40:51,963 --> 00:40:53,075
There you go.

698
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:55,569
Don't.

699
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:58,439
Now, do what you have to do.

700
00:41:00,148 --> 00:41:02,971
There's no reason to feel doubt

701
00:41:03,096 --> 00:41:04,795
or uncertainty, Brandon.

702
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:09,151
He is using you.

703
00:41:10,322 --> 00:41:11,635
None of this is your fault.

704
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,507
Don't listen to her, Brandon.

705
00:41:16,305 --> 00:41:18,023
What we're doing is right.

706
00:41:18,736 --> 00:41:20,838
We're making the world better.

707
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:22,863
You'll see.

708
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:27,854
Once you've actually pulled
that trigger, everything will change.

709
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,290
You'll feel wonderful.

710
00:41:33,781 --> 00:41:35,450
- What are you doing?!
- Brandon, no!

711
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:44,343
Where have you been?

712
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,242
I've been worried about you.

713
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:47,949
First I was at...

714
00:41:48,074 --> 00:41:50,568
at the hospital.
And then I was talking to this...

715
00:41:50,693 --> 00:41:52,093
this boy's mother.

716
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,091
And then...
