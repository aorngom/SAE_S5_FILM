1
00:00:08,867 --> 00:00:11,034
My father has always
been there for me.

2
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:12,767
His studio was at home,

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,301
so there were a lot of
models walking around naked.

4
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:17,901
<i>- they were having sex.
- How do you know?</i>

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:21,101
- I saw them.
- Why didn't you ever tell your mother what you saw?

6
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:24,067
It's not my job
to make her face reality!

7
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:27,834
I'm the child! She's supposed
to be smarter than me.

8
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:29,734
Sophie, in all the weeks
that wve been in therapy,

9
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:32,201
you've never once allowed yourself
to be angry at your father.

10
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,934
I think that your father
made you his accomplice

11
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:37,334
and he drove this wedge
between you and your mother.

12
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:38,834
Why can't you let yourself
be angry at him?

13
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:41,101
Why should I be angry at him?

14
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:43,368
She's the one who--

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,101
- Who pisses me off!
- Why?

16
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:47,368
Because she's pathetic
and annoying and--

17
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:49,667
And she's always around.

18
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:01,400
- What'd I tell ya?
- It's not 4:00.

19
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:03,234
It's five minutes to.

20
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:04,767
You said we'd be on time.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,400
We're early.

22
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,767
My apologies.

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,201
You don't
have to wait for me.

24
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:15,500
Oh, that's all right.

25
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,867
I'll take a walk.
I like this neighborhood.

26
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:24,034
Okay. Whatever.
But you don't have to.

27
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:31,767
Your hair looks
lovely like this.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,268
Really.

29
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:37,467
It looks lovely down too,
but there's something really

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,533
great about it
when it's up like this.

31
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:55,001
- Mom--
- I was gonna say--

32
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:57,034
No, what-- what
were you gonna say?

33
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,101
It was nothing.
What were you gonna say?

34
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:03,667
Well, I was
just thinking that

35
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,533
after your session,
if you weren't busy,

36
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,400
that maybe we
could do something.

37
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:11,101
<i>I know you don't like
the shoes that I bought you,</i>

38
00:02:11,134 --> 00:02:13,567
but maybe we could
go get a different pair.

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,867
Or go get coffee.

40
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:23,234
What's wrong?

41
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,167
I'm fine.

42
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,934
Tell me what you
were gonna say before.

43
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:32,001
I have to go.
I'm going to be late.

44
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,400
Everything is going to shit.

45
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:23,867
I tried talking
to my mom all week.

46
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:26,934
I just tried again
in the car

47
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:29,001
and I can't say
anything to her.

48
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:32,867
I literally can't.

49
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:35,867
I feel like there's
this lump in my throat

50
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:38,400
all the time now.

51
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:40,867
What do you think
you'd like to say to her?

52
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:43,867
I don't even know.

53
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:46,767
It's not just one thing.

54
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,600
I just want
to talk to her like--

55
00:03:58,268 --> 00:04:00,667
My dad's been calling

56
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,467
constantly
every day this week,

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,234
like he's suddenly
competing for

58
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:08,268
most attentive father
of the year award.

59
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:09,934
I haven't
called him back once.

60
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:12,533
- Why not?
- I don't know.

61
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:18,700
Why do you think
he's calling so often?

62
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:20,700
Paul, stop.

63
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:22,067
I don't know, okay?

64
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:24,800
I can't. Just give me
a fucking break.

65
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:31,167
Yesterday on beam...

66
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:35,067
My legs started to shake--

67
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:40,034
Like a spasm or something.

68
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:43,567
I've seen it happen to some of the
younger girls when they get scared.

69
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,500
I've never been
scared on the beam.

70
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:50,301
Cy was watching, so he'll
probably pull me out of the meet.

71
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:52,533
I probably won't
even get to compete.

72
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:54,634
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

73
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:57,301
What the hell
do you know about it?

74
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,268
Even if I do compete, how the fuck
am I supposed to ace a national tryout

75
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:07,634
if I'm shaking
like an epileptic?

76
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,368
I'll fall apart on the beam
and become a joke.

77
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:19,901
There's something
seriously wrong with me.

78
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:22,134
So we're going
back to this then?

79
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:27,301
That it's all your fault, that there's
something seriously wrong with you?

80
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:28,800
There is.

81
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,967
I'm all fucked up.

82
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,533
<i>In what way is that?</i>

83
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,901
gee, I don't know, Paul.

84
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:37,667
I ran my bike into a car.

85
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,433
Then as soon as they
wanted to take my cast off,

86
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:42,934
my neck mysteriously
wigged out.

87
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:45,667
Then I took your pills.

88
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,001
And now I have some
sort o a flesh-eating disease.

89
00:05:48,034 --> 00:05:49,800
I mean, look.

90
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:56,834
Didn't your dermatologist say
there wasn't anything to worry out?

91
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:58,533
What in the hell
does she know?

92
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:03,533
She didn't say that it
might be stress-related?

93
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:07,567
<i>You know that anxiety
can manifest itself</i>

94
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,800
<i>in all kinds
of physical ways.</i>

95
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:13,400
Some people
can get cramps,

96
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:17,901
migraines, a rash.

97
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:20,533
So I'm just
a little worried?

98
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,101
Okay, all better.

99
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:24,600
Sophie, you're trying to do
two big things at the moment.

100
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,634
You know, you're talking
to your mother.

101
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:29,034
You're not just berating her
like you used to do.

102
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:32,001
You're-- you're actually
trying to talk to her.

103
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,901
And you are avoiding
your father.

104
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:39,334
These are extremely
difficult things to do

105
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:42,934
because you've never
done them before.

106
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:45,368
And...

107
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,600
They could lead
to painful places.

108
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:51,368
Like telling your mother
your father's secrets

109
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,167
and telling your dad
that you're angry with him.

110
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:57,667
Don't you think that could be
causing you a lot of anxiety?

111
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:01,567
And that your body is
sending up these kind of

112
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,533
flares in the form
of a rash?

113
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:08,101
I'm almost certain, Sophie,

114
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:11,101
that there is nothing
physically wrong with you.

115
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:14,634
You don't know that.

116
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:19,134
I remember once years ago when
I was starting my practice,

117
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:22,867
I moved to the city
and got a new apartment.

118
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,467
Everything was going
really well.

119
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,834
Very happy, I thought.

120
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:30,767
And then one day
I was with a patient

121
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,234
and for no reason
my heart started to pound.

122
00:07:33,268 --> 00:07:34,901
I couldn't breathe.

123
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:36,500
I had this
ringing in my ears

124
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:39,001
when suddenly my tongue
started to swell up.

125
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,867
So this patient
called the ambulance

126
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:43,101
and they-- they took me
to the hospital.

127
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:46,368
Took me to this room,
did all these kinds of tests.

128
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:51,234
You know what they
found in the end?

129
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:55,067
What?

130
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:56,800
Nothing.

131
00:07:56,834 --> 00:08:00,400
I'd had what they
call an anxiety attack.

132
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:04,634
Guess I was more...

133
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,167
Overwhelmed and stressed
than I thought I was.

134
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:09,967
I think that's bullshit.

135
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:14,268
Does this look like a little
anxiety rash to you?

136
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:16,901
Well, doctor?

137
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:18,533
Hello?

138
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,101
Look at me, you shit!

139
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:23,700
Am I that much of a freak
that you can't even look at me?

140
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:27,001
What's the matter, Paul?
Am I embarrassing you?

141
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:29,334
Crossing your boundaries?

142
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:32,700
You want to disappear when somebody
else wants something from you?

143
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:40,700
Do I still seem
normal to you?

144
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:45,167
Mm-hmm.

145
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:52,901
I shocked you.

146
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,901
You're shocked.

147
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:02,700
My titties scared you.

148
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:07,268
How can they? They're just
these tiny little things.

149
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:11,734
Does the size
of your breasts

150
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,767
upset you, Sophie?

151
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,167
Of coursnot.

152
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:18,201
It's just what
happens to gymnasts.

153
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,201
It's the diet.

154
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:23,533
When girls stop training
they explode.

155
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:28,467
They gain weight, grow
a great big rack and ass,

156
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
get full periods.

157
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,800
They become normal.

158
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:35,268
I know it's not normal
to be like this, I get that.

159
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,634
I'd say that you
had the body of a--

160
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,467
A fucking freak.

161
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,634
I have the body
of a child.

162
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:50,567
But I'm not a child. Children
don't want to kill themselves.

163
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:56,400
That's true.

164
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:07,767
Are you thinking about death
again, Sophie?

165
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:14,034
Do you know why?

166
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,700
Because everythingis falling apart a

167
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:21,067
it's what I'm trying
to tell you.

168
00:10:21,101 --> 00:10:24,134
It's like that dream
I used to have

169
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,934
where the pretty Meadow
turns to ash

170
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:27,834
right in front of my eyes.

171
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,867
Except I'm awake

172
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:31,600
and I can't make it stop.

173
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:43,134
You know, I was remembering
something that you told me.

174
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,500
The time when you
were in the ambulance.

175
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:50,934
You remember? You wanted
to put the mirror outside

176
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:53,001
so that you could see
what was going on.

177
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:55,867
You couldn't see
anything except yourself.

178
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:58,067
- Do you remember that?
- So what?

179
00:10:58,101 --> 00:11:00,567
Well, I think sometimes
when things go wrong

180
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,368
in your life, Sophie,
you blame yourself.

181
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:07,101
Whenever a situation
seems difficult,

182
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,533
you assume that it's--
That it's your fault.

183
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:13,934
You built this surrogate home
with Cy and darlene

184
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:15,667
and it fell apart for you.

185
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,667
And you blamed yourself,

186
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,767
not Cy.

187
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,334
And you decided
to punish yourself

188
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:24,368
by riding your
bicycle into a car.

189
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,834
See, the thing is, if you see
yourself always as the problem,

190
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:30,500
you're going
to create discord

191
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:33,067
in-- in the most
perfect places.

192
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:35,867
Did it ever
occur to you

193
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:39,034
that Cy was the person
responsible for what happened?

194
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:42,067
- It was my fault.
- But why does it have to be your fault?

195
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:45,467
Because it is. That's the
second time it's happened.

196
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,934
You mean it's the second
time your home fell apart.

197
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:50,268
But why would you think
that that was your fault?

198
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:54,567
- I don't know. It just was.
- No, I need you to tell me.

199
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,901
- I don't know. - no,
it's important for you--

200
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:58,867
- I don't know, Paul.
- No, but--

201
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,901
Stop it!

202
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:04,567
You want me to have some big
breakthrough today, I can see that.

203
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,034
Why don't you just
tell me what the answer is

204
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,567
and I'll repeat it
back to you

205
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,934
and you can put a Gold Star
on my forehead?

206
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:18,533
What I'm trying to do is
help you find your own answers.

207
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,567
And I think that you are

208
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,034
really close to that.

209
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:26,567
And I understand
how scary that must be.

210
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:39,967
Have you ever read the bible?

211
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:45,467
Isn't that like illegal
for you to ask me that?

212
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,667
Not really.

213
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,901
It's really just
a subject like any other.

214
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:55,067
You n choose to talk about it or not.

215
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:58,034
Anyway,
in the new testament

216
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:00,167
God is always
portrayed as being good

217
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:02,234
and wickedness
and evil is a human thing,

218
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:03,734
a human problem.

219
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,433
Actually, it's one
of the things

220
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,700
that's helped christianity
to spread very quickly.

221
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:12,533
Can you--
Can you think why?

222
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,567
Because people like to feel
shitty about themselves?

223
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,368
That's it. Exactly.

224
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,234
We prefer to live
in a world where God is good

225
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:26,700
and man is bad rather than
a world where God is bad.

226
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:29,268
So an evil authority,
an unfair government,

227
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:32,201
neglectful parents--
That's a pretty scary concept.

228
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:34,433
Makes your whole life seem

229
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,334
kind of scary
and meaningless.

230
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:40,001
It is one of the reasons why
children will blame themselves

231
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:41,800
before their parents.

232
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,567
You told me once that you
wanted to move across the country

233
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,934
to be with your dad and his
new wife, but that they--

234
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:55,800
They didn't have a room
for you in her house.

235
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,600
You said that
they argued about it

236
00:13:57,634 --> 00:13:59,901
and that eventually
he left her, right?

237
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:02,634
- Right.
- How long did it take him

238
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,834
to-- to leave her?

239
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,134
I don't know,
over two years.

240
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,834
hmm.

241
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:15,433
And during that whole time,
your mother was depressed

242
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:17,567
and crying constantly, yeah?

243
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,301
And you wanted to move
to your dad and be with him,

244
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:21,834
but you couldn't.

245
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:23,901
Two years is a long time
for a child

246
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:26,634
to be without
a safe place to call home.

247
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,934
I told you, he left her
because of that.

248
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:31,667
After two years, Sophie.

249
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,234
I don't understand.

250
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,533
How could he
just stop loving me?

251
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:52,101
What did I do?

252
00:14:52,134 --> 00:14:54,667
You didn do anything.

253
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,500
Isn't there
a law somewhere

254
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:01,334
that says parents have
to love their kids forever?

255
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:04,700
You're right, but you
must've screwed up somewhere.

256
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,433
Otherwise, how could they
treat you like this?

257
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:12,201
A father can't just abandon
his perfectly normal daughter,

258
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:14,467
swap her for a new famy.

259
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,268
A mother can't just fall into a
deep depression and ignore her.

260
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:21,001
Must be your fault.

261
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,500
Maybe if I had told
my mother about the cheating

262
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:33,667
then at least things
would be better with her.

263
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,901
Sophie, that is not
the sort of responsibility

264
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,634
a child should
be asked to handle.

265
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,334
Your father cheated
on your mother,

266
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:41,567
you didn't tell her,
then he left.

267
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,867
You needed that order of
events to somehow make sense

268
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,667
so you blamed yourself

269
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,834
because nothing else
made sense.

270
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,567
Sophie...

271
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:05,201
Listen to me.

272
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,667
You saw your dad cheating
and you didn't tell your mom.

273
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,467
Now do you honestly think

274
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,800
that that's a reason
for you to be abandoned?

275
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,301
I found my diary
from fourth grade.

276
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:38,301
I us to edite
in this thing constantly.

277
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:41,433
Did you ever keep a diary?

278
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,034
no.

279
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,301
I took it out
because I wanted to see

280
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:50,268
if you were right

281
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,901
about how hard it was
for me to lie to my mother.

282
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,433
Do you want me
to read you what I found?

283
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:01,700
I'd be honored.

284
00:17:20,101 --> 00:17:22,101
"dear hermione"--
I pretended that I was

285
00:17:22,134 --> 00:17:24,167
writing to hermione granger.

286
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:27,034
- Who's that?
- You know, from "Harry potter."

287
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:30,134
Tell me you've read those.

288
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:32,800
Are you insane?

289
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,533
I just haven't
gotten around to it yet.

290
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:39,167
- They've been out for 10 years.
- I know I know I know.

291
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:40,800
I'll bring you my set
next week, okay?

292
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:42,767
No, that's not
necessary, honestly.

293
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,067
My kids have them.

294
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:46,700
- They've read them?
- Uh-huh.

295
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,867
And-- and they
really love them.

296
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,600
Okay.

297
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:52,334
Maybe you're not
such a fucked-up parent.

298
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:54,901
Thank you.

299
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:57,934
"dear hermione,

300
00:17:57,967 --> 00:17:59,834
it was a terrible day today.

301
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:02,001
I am so sad.

302
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:03,767
I'm sorry I haven't
written to you in a while.

303
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,634
I know you must
be angry and Miss me.

304
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,700
I Miss you too.

305
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:10,433
I wanted to tell you
everything,

306
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:12,067
but I know I must
hide things from you

307
00:18:12,101 --> 00:18:14,533
because she
might read it.

308
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:15,934
I'm afraid from now on

309
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:18,067
you and I must
sustain rselous."

310
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,734
What is it?

311
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:25,734
I wrote "sustained"
instead of "restrained."

312
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,901
Where did you
keep this diary?

313
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:34,234
On my night table.

314
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:36,034
Not hidden away?

315
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:43,101
You know,
it's a wonderful gift,

316
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:45,301
this diary.

317
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,034
It's a real clue

318
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:48,600
to who you are.

319
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:51,101
There you are
in fourth grade,

320
00:18:51,134 --> 00:18:53,368
you're already pulling
away from your world.

321
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,867
You're establishing
a relationship with somebody

322
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,634
who cannot let you down--

323
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,567
Hermione.

324
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,001
You're confiding in her.

325
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:07,001
But you're still hoping
that your mother will notice.

326
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,667
You think I wanted her
to find the diary?

327
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,767
I think so.

328
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:18,967
And you wanted her
to ask what you're hiding.

329
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,934
You said there, um,

330
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,034
it was a terrible day.
What did you mean by that?

331
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:34,467
Oh. It was
september 11th.

332
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:39,967
wow.

333
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:44,767
Go on. Please.

334
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:49,800
Do I have to read it?
It's so fucking naive.

335
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:51,500
I'd like to hear it.

336
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:00,700
"today, bad men
from other countries

337
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:02,667
hijacked airplanes
and flew them

338
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,533
into important
American buildings.

339
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,201
There were people inside

340
00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:09,167
the planes and buildings.

341
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:12,067
Good people.

342
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:14,400
Dad says I'm going
to inherit an evil world."

343
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:22,234
I hate him so much.

344
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:24,067
I hate him
so much.

345
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:26,734
What kind of a fucking idiot
tells a fourth-grader

346
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,134
that she's going
to inherit an evil world?

347
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:30,967
If he really believed that,

348
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:33,067
then why didn't he do
something about it

349
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:36,268
instead of running off
to l. A. To photograph bimbos?

350
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:41,001
hmm.

351
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:44,967
- So you're not picking up his calls?
- No way.

352
00:20:46,268 --> 00:20:48,634
So he doesn't even know
that you're angry at him?

353
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,834
I don't want
to talk about this now.

354
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:53,600
Okay.

355
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:57,500
But when you're ready, 'll welk
about what you want to say to him.

356
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:00,834
Okay?

357
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:05,667
Okay.

358
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:12,301
So you really think the rash and
spasms are coming from my head?

359
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:15,600
Mm-hmm, but that doesn't
mean they're not real.

360
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:19,201
But I don't think that it's--
That it's a disease.

361
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,533
So what do I do about it?

362
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,134
I think you need to start
to forgive yourself.

363
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:29,433
Forgive myself for what?

364
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:31,767
<i>For not telling your mother
about your father's affair.</i>

365
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,967
You know, what you
have to understand is that

366
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,467
they were gonna
break up anyway

367
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,001
no matter what you did.

368
00:21:38,034 --> 00:21:41,600
You are not responsible
for your parents' actions.

369
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,834
The only actions that
we can control are our own.

370
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:51,201
And the only power we have
is how we treat other people

371
00:21:51,234 --> 00:21:53,400
and how we treat ourselves.

372
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:58,734
So you want me
to forgive myself?

373
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:00,901
Mm-hmm.

374
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,201
how?

375
00:22:05,234 --> 00:22:06,967
<i>Slowly.</i>

376
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:10,067
<i>It's gonna take a while.</i>

377
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:12,467
It's taken you a few years
to fall into this

378
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,167
and it's probably
gonna take you a while

379
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,268
to get out of it.

380
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:21,067
But you have to
start trying now.

381
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:25,967
'cause you know something?

382
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:29,067
You deserve to be happy.

383
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:51,167
Que lástima.

384
00:22:51,201 --> 00:22:53,301
hmm?

385
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:56,433
It's from a Spanish song.
It means what a shame.

386
00:22:56,467 --> 00:22:58,800
<i>Ah.
Que-- que lástima.</i>

387
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,700
"A ciertas luces pareces una estrella de cine."

388
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:09,400
Wow -- my Spanish is dreadful.

389
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:10,934
What does that mean?

390
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:14,700
It means, "In a certain light,
you look like a movie star."

391
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,600
Oh.

392
00:23:16,634 --> 00:23:18,800
Well, gracias.

393
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,368
The competition is on
Friday. Should I go?

394
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,034
I think so.

395
00:23:33,134 --> 00:23:35,467
I think that you
really want to and...

396
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,433
I agree that you should go.

397
00:23:45,101 --> 00:23:47,134
- I have to go.
- Okay.

398
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:51,134
My mom's waiting
for me in the car.

399
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:52,800
She wants
to take me shopping.

400
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:54,767
Oh, shopping.
Wow, that sounds rough.

401
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,867
Listen, if you decide
to compete

402
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:00,867
and you start
to feel anxious,

403
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:02,334
I want you to call me, okay?

404
00:24:02,368 --> 00:24:04,967
You know,
don't be shy.

405
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:06,967
I'm never shy.

406
00:24:07,934 --> 00:24:10,400
Sometimes,
I'm circumspect

407
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:12,001
or wary,
but not shy.

408
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,700
I stand corrected.

409
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:15,400
And listen,
if you're up on the beam

410
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:17,934
and your legs
start to shake,

411
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:20,600
try saying
this to yourself:

412
00:24:20,634 --> 00:24:23,667
"im making this happen.
It is coming from inside me

413
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,600
and because I am
making it happen,

414
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:28,667
I can make it stop."

415
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:32,800
Does that really work?

416
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:35,134
Mmm, I think it can, yeah.

417
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:37,734
I used it on myself
a few years ago

418
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,433
and it did work.

419
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:43,700
- Okay, I'll try it.
- Okay.

420
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:24,567
Where to?

421
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,301
Wherever you'd like--
The mall, the movies...

422
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:30,368
Let's go home.

423
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,533
Okay.

424
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:42,368
We can stop for coffee
somewhere if you wanted to.

425
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,301
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

426
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:51,567
We don't have to.

427
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,234
No, we should.
We should do that.
