1
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:04,545
Hi.

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:07,099
Would you like to come in?

3
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:16,529
Listen, Oliver, this is the last chance
you're gonna have to talk to Paul

4
00:00:16,654 --> 00:00:18,154
before we move away.

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,479
Don't you at least want
to say goodbye to him?

6
00:00:24,073 --> 00:00:28,077
Oliver, your mom and I are gonna
be in my office, talking.

7
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,362
So if you feel like it, just...

8
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:34,768
come in and join us
anytime you want, okay?

9
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:38,907
Whatever.

10
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:55,804
Synchro: michvanilly, salomon.

11
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:15,241
I know you hate me.

12
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,910
Why would you say that, Bess?

13
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:20,982
I'm doing everything
you told me not to do.

14
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:23,037
So you have...

15
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:26,176
You have decided to leave?

16
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:29,403
First thing Saturday morning,

17
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:31,435
packing up the U-Haul

18
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,300
and driving upstate.

19
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,468
Can I ask you
how Oliver is taking all this?

20
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:40,299
Very badly.
Thanks for asking.

21
00:01:42,184 --> 00:01:44,384
He's barely spoken to me all week.

22
00:01:45,113 --> 00:01:46,463
And when he does,

23
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:52,231
he's finding more and more
colorful ways of telling me to fuck off.

24
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:56,001
If you've accomplished
nothing else here,

25
00:01:56,126 --> 00:01:59,026
you've certainly helped him
get in touch with his anger.

26
00:01:59,777 --> 00:02:02,377
Do you feel that
I have disappointed you?

27
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:05,971
It's embarrassing
to admit this now, but...

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,644
when he first started coming here
I was sure you'd be on my side.

29
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:12,882
Were you?

30
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,267
You're so smart and reasonable,

31
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:19,624
I thought{\ for sure} you'd be able
to get through to Oliver,

32
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:21,724
{\ and }maybe {\even }knock some sense into Luke.

33
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:26,129
You had high hopes for me.

34
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:33,978
Then that night when I came
to pick up Oliver's turtle

35
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:38,472
it was so clear to me
that you live here all alone.

36
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:41,899
And something about,

37
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:44,865
you know, the empty place,
it just...

38
00:02:45,585 --> 00:02:48,085
seemed familiar to me.
And I thought...

39
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,836
I thought when I told you about
my new job, you'd be more sympathetic.

40
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:55,561
It's not that I'm not
sympathetic to you,

41
00:02:56,892 --> 00:03:00,088
but my job
is to advocate for Oliver.

42
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:05,121
So if I feel that you're not acting in
his best interest, I have to tell you.

43
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:08,800
Believe me, I know that
where Oliver's concerned,

44
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,339
I'm making a bad situation
even worse.

45
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:16,808
But I can't wake up
in that house anymore.

46
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:20,970
And all I'm saying is that Oliver needs
familiar things around him now.

47
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:24,453
And if he doesn't get those things,
there may very well be

48
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:25,965
consequences.

49
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:31,163
You know that announcement
they make on planes

50
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:32,738
about oxygen masks?

51
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:35,491
You know how you should
secure your own mask first

52
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,916
before you help your child with his?

53
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:40,831
I feel like
that's what I'm doing now.

54
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:45,646
If you want my advice, I'd say that you
should adjust your mask immediately,

55
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:48,321
because your son really
needs your help.

56
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:56,913
The way you're talking, it makes me
wonder if I've spent Oliver's whole life

57
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:59,058
finding different ways
to be selfish with him.

58
00:03:59,183 --> 00:04:01,583
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean...

59
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,708
I had Oliver in the first place
partly because...

60
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:08,330
I was graduating.
I didn't know what else to do.

61
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:12,926
And then I spent the next 12 years
entirely devoted to him,

62
00:04:13,697 --> 00:04:15,997
which helped me forget that I was...

63
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:19,154
pathologically incapable
of finishing my degree

64
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:24,206
and that my husband and I weren't
really getting along anymore.

65
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:29,325
And now here
I am violently uprooting him

66
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:31,686
all because I need
a change of scene.

67
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,341
I think it's one of the hardest things
about being a parent...

68
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:36,566
Trying to...

69
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:40,145
weigh your own needs
against those of your kid.

70
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:44,012
It's a constant balancing act.

71
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:50,126
Oliver told me last week
on the playground

72
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:53,208
he asked if he could
come live with you.

73
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:56,586
And when I said "why?",
he said because

74
00:04:56,988 --> 00:05:00,038
he's happier with you
than he is with me or Luke."

75
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:02,246
Is that right?

76
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:03,927
Well, that's what he said.

77
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,557
- It's probably the truth.
- I don't think it's the whole truth.

78
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,867
What he really needs now
is a home where he can feel safe.

79
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:15,438
You need to build that for him.

80
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:17,976
That's what you've got to remember.

81
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:24,119
He also said he was very angry

82
00:05:24,655 --> 00:05:26,658
that you wouldn't take him in
when he asked you to.

83
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,035
Well, I think he's got
every right to be.

84
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:35,486
I think you're his best friend.

85
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,045
And I'm taking him away from you.

86
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,633
I don't think he's ever gonna
forgive me for that.

87
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:47,663
I don't think he should.

88
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:52,222
Come in.

89
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:58,645
I wasn't expecting you.

90
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,825
I was in the neighbourhood.

91
00:06:01,432 --> 00:06:03,032
Why don't you join us?

92
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:13,697
I've been at our old
apartment all afternoon,

93
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:16,122
packing things up to put in storage.

94
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,543
And suddenly I just...

95
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:21,776
felt the need to talk to somebody.

96
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,713
And then I remembered
it was Wednesday at 4:00,

97
00:06:26,414 --> 00:06:29,414
so I figured I'd already
paid for the hour, so...

98
00:06:31,054 --> 00:06:33,443
When you were knocking
we thought it was Oliver

99
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:35,968
and that he was finally
ready to talk.

100
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:37,461
No such luck.

101
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,955
He's sitting there like he's getting
ready to strangle somebody.

102
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,280
At least he hasn't run away again.

103
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:45,411
Small blessings, right?

104
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:51,377
I'm taking the next couple
of days off to be with him

105
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:53,452
before he and Bess move away.

106
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,319
But since he's not speaking to me,

107
00:06:56,444 --> 00:06:58,929
I don't know what kind
of activities we're gonna do.

108
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:03,087
I guess we could play
a lot of charades{\, you know?}.

109
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:08,414
You said you wanted
to talk about something.

110
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:11,846
What is it?

111
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:16,162
I don't know, just this...

112
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:18,878
memory I was having
of the three of us

113
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:21,856
moving into that place
when Oliver was a baby.

114
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:25,322
I don't know

115
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:29,159
how we thought we could
afford a whole brownstone floor.

116
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:33,345
We were living so far
beyond our means.

117
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:36,645
And the place was a complete wreck.

118
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:39,135
The plaster was crumbling.

119
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,087
The walls were just buckling.

120
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:44,554
There were exposed
wires everywhere you looked.

121
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:50,380
We were so deluded, we thought
we could actually fix it up ourselves.

122
00:07:50,505 --> 00:07:53,644
There was this pipe
in the bathroom that...

123
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,543
spurting little drops
of hot water into the air.

124
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:00,657
I never could fix it, so we had
to keep the window open all the time

125
00:08:00,782 --> 00:08:03,722
- 'cause it was like a sauna in there.
- Except it was the dead of winter.

126
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:06,497
And so one morning
I was brushing my teeth

127
00:08:07,455 --> 00:08:08,455
and...

128
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:12,615
the warm air from the water pipe
met the cold air from the window

129
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,083
and it started raining on me inside.

130
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:37,129
The two of you have...

131
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:40,987
an ease with each other
that I've never seen before.

132
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:44,581
Why do you think that is?

133
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:50,934
'Cause it's over.

134
00:08:56,918 --> 00:08:59,446
You knew it a long time
before I did.

135
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:04,408
And then even when
it was really clear to me, I was just...

136
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,183
too stubborn to let go.

137
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:09,153
I was pretty stubborn myself.

138
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,390
I was trying to...

139
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,469
get you to be somebody you weren't

140
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:18,016
in a marriage I didn't want.

141
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:31,319
We were just children

142
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,825
playing house.

143
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,139
If we didn't have Oliver...

144
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:40,664
All this time and effort,
and that's all we are.

145
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:44,568
Just...

146
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,418
two people who should have
never gotten married.

147
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:53,215
Look, I'm sure that your understanding
of what you are to each other

148
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:55,633
will continue to evolve and change.

149
00:09:56,485 --> 00:09:59,415
But now that
you've reached this point,

150
00:09:59,952 --> 00:10:02,568
perhaps we can stop blaming
each other for all the ways

151
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:04,593
that you've failed your son.

152
00:10:04,718 --> 00:10:08,529
And maybe you can finally
work together to be his parents.

153
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,627
Because even if you feel that

154
00:10:11,752 --> 00:10:14,302
you've always been
wrong for each other,

155
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:16,754
he is the one thing...

156
00:10:17,077 --> 00:10:20,477
The one extraordinary thing
that you have built together.

157
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:38,350
I'd better get back to the apartment
'cause I have a lot of packing to do.

158
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:40,888
You want me to come over later,
help you pack up?

159
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:46,014
Actually, I thought maybe
you'd like to take Oliver tonight.

160
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:49,673
I thought I wasn't supposed
to get him until tomorrow.

161
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:52,611
It {\just }occurred to me that maybe you'd
like to spend {\some }more time with him

162
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:53,946
before we leave.

163
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:58,447
Okay.

164
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,765
Okay, I'm going to see
if I can get Oliver to come in and talk.

165
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:12,440
Bess, I just want to say

166
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,484
that I've been harsh at times,

167
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:19,136
but I really admire your courage.

168
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:24,467
Thank you.

169
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:52,798
So...

170
00:11:55,087 --> 00:11:58,507
Now I get the next two and a half days
to make up for the past 12 years.

171
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,554
Are you worried about what's gonna
happen once Oliver moves away?

172
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,712
Bess will be trying to take care of{\ Oliver} him
while she's starting a new job.

173
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:12,037
I'll be driving up there
and back twice every weekend.

174
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:15,888
Oliver will probably be
more miserable than he is now.

175
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,267
It'll be a disaster.

176
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:22,231
Are you absolutely sure
there's nothing else that you can do?

177
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:25,993
I've gone over it a million times{\ in my head},
and I just don't know what else to do.

178
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,830
What, you think I'm excited
about being a divorced dad,

179
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:35,155
only seeing my kid on the weekend?

180
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,171
It's not the way I wanted it.

181
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:40,025
Do you feel like...

182
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:41,842
you've failed Oliver?

183
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,260
Of course I do.

184
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:48,115
I know what it felt like
to have my father erase me.

185
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:54,025
It's the main reason why
I stayed married all these years,

186
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:57,441
trying to avoid
what's happening right now.

187
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:00,600
It's not too late to undo all this,
you know.

188
00:13:00,725 --> 00:13:01,775
Yes, it is.

189
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,625
I've already lost him.

190
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:08,795
That's become clear
over the past couple of months.

191
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:10,195
Oh, yeah, he'll...

192
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,770
let me buy him some sneakers
or take him to see the Knicks,

193
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:14,885
but he won't come to me
when he has problems.

194
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,495
Look, he may be pulling away
from you now because he's angry,

195
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,990
but he still needs you very much.

196
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:24,415
I never really learned
how to take care of him.

197
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:27,385
I always passed him off to Bess.

198
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:33,393
Truth is,

199
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:37,945
I probably never wanted to be
a father in the first place.

200
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:41,085
- Do you love your son?
- Yes.

201
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:43,145
Of course.

202
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:47,335
But look what I did last week.

203
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,995
I mean, Bess says she's moving away,

204
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:54,873
and I didn't lift a finger
to fight for Oliver.

205
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,001
I practically forced her
to take him.

206
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:03,131
Because I didn't know
how to handle him.

207
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:07,135
I understand there's a lot of things
that you wish you'd done differently,

208
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:09,015
but that's in the past.

209
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:11,038
The only thing
that really matters now

210
00:14:11,163 --> 00:14:13,896
is the kind of father
you're going to be to Oliver

211
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,471
from here on out.

212
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,155
Right, so what do we have
to look forward to?

213
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:21,835
I'll see him less and less, right?

214
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:25,612
I'll become the man
who writes the checks.

215
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,280
Look, it doesn't have
to be that bleak.

216
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:32,400
You have a lot of control over how big
a part you play in his life.

217
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:35,032
Because the truth is,
your relationship with Oliver,

218
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:37,057
it's never going to be over.

219
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:40,605
He'll always want you
to be his father.

220
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:43,245
So you can't ever give up on him

221
00:14:43,745 --> 00:14:44,845
or yourself.

222
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:49,145
All right.

223
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,679
I understand.

224
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:55,182
So do you have any tips to give me,

225
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,425
any words of wisdom
before you punch out?

226
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:02,023
Nothing that
you really want to hear.

227
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:06,310
The truth is, {\Luke, }there's a good chance
things are gonna get worse for Oliver

228
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:07,445
and for you.

229
00:15:07,895 --> 00:15:11,395
For a long time,
he is going to be very angry at you.

230
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:15,075
And you're gonna have to keep
loving him, no matter what.

231
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:19,145
You're gonna have to
let him have his anger.

232
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:23,125
And you're gonna have to take it,
just let him be who he is.

233
00:15:23,545 --> 00:15:26,145
- So just take it?
- And keep showing up.

234
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:31,678
- All right, I think I can do that.
- And take it step by step.

235
00:15:31,885 --> 00:15:34,510
Right now you've got
two and a half days with him,

236
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:35,935
all to yourself.

237
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:37,725
Take advantage of that.

238
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:45,115
All right.

239
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:52,115
You know, before we go,
I think you and Oliver should talk.

240
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:54,705
Let's try.

241
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,880
It's almost time to head out.

242
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:10,745
Do you want to go into the office
and say goodbye to Paul?

243
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:25,275
I understand why you might be mad
with everything,

244
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:28,651
but you know none of it
is Paul's fault.

245
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:31,988
And I know you like him a lot.

246
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:34,445
And he really cares about you too.

247
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:40,788
Maybe you're feeling too angry
to talk right now,

248
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:43,265
but someday,

249
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:46,285
I bet you won't be so angry anymore.

250
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:49,345
And you'll miss him.

251
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:53,593
And you'll be glad you had
the opportunity to see him today.

252
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,825
So what do you say?

253
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:12,985
All right.

254
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:18,409
Thank you, Luke.

255
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:37,095
How are you?

256
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:40,098
You didn't help me at all.

257
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:44,565
Look,

258
00:17:47,415 --> 00:17:49,065
I'm sorry I let you down.

259
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:50,905
Everything got worse.

260
00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:53,736
I wish I could solve
all your problems, Oliver,

261
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:56,415
but I just... I can't.

262
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:02,359
But one thing I can do
is talk with you

263
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:05,085
about everything that's going on.

264
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,291
So what?

265
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:09,240
Well, for one thing, maybe

266
00:18:09,365 --> 00:18:11,922
it will help you feel less alone.

267
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:13,047
I am alone.

268
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:15,509
And I'm not gonna get
to see you anymore.

269
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:16,634
I know.

270
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:21,395
And that's why I'm really glad
that we had this chance

271
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:24,075
just to talk.

272
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:32,441
Why don't you tell me about your week?
Let's begin there.

273
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,685
Today was my last day at school.

274
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,515
And how did that go?

275
00:18:39,195 --> 00:18:41,445
They had a going-away party for me.

276
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,705
My teacher made brownies.

277
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,122
Eric wasn't there, so that was good.

278
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,748
Why wasn't Eric there?

279
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:49,620
He was in the hospital.

280
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:51,945
What's Eric doing in the hospital?

281
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:55,495
He was lighting some M-80s

282
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,092
and they exploded
and blew his pinkie off.

283
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:03,597
That's pretty awful for Eric,
don't you think?

284
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:06,851
Why do you think
he picked on you so much?

285
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:11,105
Do you think it might have been because
he had so many problems of his own{\, you know}?

286
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:15,175
Maybe.

287
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:17,155
So how is Maya doing?

288
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:21,045
She got me a going-away gift.

289
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:22,933
Cool. What did she get?

290
00:19:26,585 --> 00:19:27,735
That's sweet.

291
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:32,543
You're gonna miss her, right?

292
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:41,645
I'll miss my house.

293
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:46,865
Your dad told me that he came over today
to help you pack.

294
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:48,058
How was that?

295
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:49,805
Weird.

296
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:53,505
Like he was living with us again,
except he wasn't.

297
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,943
He and my mom
both started to cry a little.

298
00:19:58,455 --> 00:19:59,605
Both of them?

299
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:03,782
So what was that like?

300
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,045
I hated it.

301
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:09,205
You know, once when I was
about your age, I saw my dad cry.

302
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:14,463
He was having a big fight
with my mom.

303
00:20:14,895 --> 00:20:16,879
They were yelling at each other.

304
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:19,035
I just wanted them to stop.

305
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:21,425
I guess I wanted them to be...

306
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:23,965
to be just happy.

307
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,925
And it made me so pissed

308
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,755
when I found out that...

309
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:31,215
that they weren't.

310
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:35,325
So what did you do?

311
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,380
Well, I stayed pissed at them
for a long time.

312
00:20:42,035 --> 00:20:43,885
And then I realized that...

313
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:48,051
even though
my mom and dad got upset,

314
00:20:48,176 --> 00:20:50,776
and they made
big mistakes sometimes,

315
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,375
they still loved me.

316
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:58,395
What am I supposed to do?

317
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:03,940
If you're not getting
something that you need,

318
00:21:04,065 --> 00:21:05,065
tell them.

319
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:08,055
If you don't understand why
something is happening, say:

320
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,480
"Can you please explain this to me?"

321
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:14,215
And if things get really
upsetting and confusing,

322
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:15,455
call me.

323
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:19,825
That way we can work together
to try and solve the problem.

324
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:29,660
Does your son live far away?

325
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:35,845
I go visit him on weekends.

326
00:21:37,065 --> 00:21:41,069
This Saturday I’m taking him to the air
and space museum in Washington, D.C.

327
00:21:41,945 --> 00:21:45,595
He likes to look at the rockets
and the satellites especially.

328
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:49,596
Do you miss him?

329
00:21:51,635 --> 00:21:52,785
All the time.

330
00:21:53,755 --> 00:21:54,755
But, see,

331
00:21:55,345 --> 00:21:57,345
I'm with him whenever...

332
00:21:57,665 --> 00:21:59,065
whenever I can be.

333
00:22:02,106 --> 00:22:04,106
I'm always thinking about him.

334
00:22:05,735 --> 00:22:07,531
I mean, we talk on the phone
every day.

335
00:22:08,475 --> 00:22:10,725
So I get to hear what he has to say

336
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:14,525
and I get to tell him
what's going on with me.

337
00:22:18,745 --> 00:22:21,253
That reminds me...
I've got to make a call.

338
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:25,465
Can you give me a sec?

339
00:22:45,675 --> 00:22:48,075
- Hello.
- Hey, Oliver.

340
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:51,115
It's Paul in Brooklyn.

341
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:54,910
I just thought I'd check in
and see how...

342
00:22:55,035 --> 00:22:57,164
how things were going upstate.

343
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:58,482
This is dumb.

344
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,005
So how are you?

345
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:04,880
When did you move in?

346
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:08,575
Last week.

347
00:23:09,275 --> 00:23:11,425
And how has it been going so far?

348
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:14,890
Okay, I guess.

349
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:16,715
Where's your house?

350
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:18,685
In the middle of nowhere.

351
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:20,705
Do you like your room?

352
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:21,985
Not really.

353
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:24,365
In Brooklyn,
my room is painted blue.

354
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,610
What if you and your mom
go to the hardware store

355
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:28,478
and buy some blue paint?

356
00:23:29,385 --> 00:23:30,935
That way your room...

357
00:23:31,715 --> 00:23:34,400
your room can look the same
as it did in Brooklyn.

358
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:35,525
I guess.

359
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,920
How are you and your mom
getting on these days?

360
00:23:39,045 --> 00:23:40,445
She's really busy.

361
00:23:41,105 --> 00:23:44,502
She's teaching a lot,
so I don't get to see her very much.

362
00:23:44,785 --> 00:23:47,535
But you have dinner together
every night, yeah?

363
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:50,355
And then you tell her...

364
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:52,469
You tell her all about your day.

365
00:23:55,795 --> 00:23:57,995
Has your dad come up to visit you?

366
00:23:58,555 --> 00:23:59,805
Not yet, but...

367
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,780
This weekend he's coming to get me
and we're going to the city.

368
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:03,905
Cool.

369
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,608
But I'm not sure
what we're gonna do there.

370
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:08,326
When you talk to him,

371
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:13,580
maybe you could just make a list
of the things that you want to do.

372
00:24:13,705 --> 00:24:16,493
Maybe, I don't know,
go to a basketball game,

373
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:20,385
maybe even go back to that restaurant
where you had the paella.

374
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:22,791
That'd be fun.

375
00:24:23,777 --> 00:24:25,377
So how are things going at school?

376
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:28,672
All the kids are strange.

377
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,140
I bet there's...

378
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,051
one or two kids
that you kind of like.

379
00:24:37,115 --> 00:24:39,215
It's gonna take a while, Oliver.

380
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:43,445
Everything's gonna be
new and strange for a bit.

381
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:46,545
But I think you're gonna do okay.

382
00:24:47,775 --> 00:24:51,675
I think things are gonna work out
and you're just going to be fine.

383
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,736
- I have to go now.
- Oh, it's dinner time?

384
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:01,413
Yeah. I'll call you next week.

385
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:04,905
Goodbye, Oliver.

386
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,575
I should go now.

387
00:25:30,575 --> 00:25:32,775
Well, we still have
a little bit of time.

388
00:25:34,545 --> 00:25:36,745
Is there anything else that you...

389
00:25:37,655 --> 00:25:39,555
that you want to talk about?
