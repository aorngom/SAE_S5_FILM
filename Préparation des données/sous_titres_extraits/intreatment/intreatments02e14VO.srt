1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,703
Damn it, you're not listening to me.

2
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:11,206
Listen to me!

3
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:14,543
It doesn't matter.

4
00:00:14,703 --> 00:00:18,276
We can't wait for the report.
We're gonna issue the recall.

5
00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:19,759
All of it!

6
00:00:20,261 --> 00:00:22,058
All right, Jace, fine.

7
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:26,059
Yeah, you think you need
to protect your ass, that's fine.

8
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:29,737
Just call the Donaldsons and tell them
it was my call, all right?

9
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:32,735
Jesus.

10
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,381
Synchro: So., mpm

11
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:55,372
Marie, is he off?

12
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:58,720
All right, get me Burt.

13
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,969
I'm sorry about this.
It's bad enough I'm late, but...

14
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:04,027
Burt?
Yeah, Walter.

15
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:10,619
I'm sorry but they wouldn't let me use
my phone until I cleared customs.

16
00:01:12,335 --> 00:01:14,385
I can't reach the Donaldsons.

17
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,410
No, but we're gonna go ahead
with the recall anyway.

18
00:01:17,913 --> 00:01:19,763
I don't trust Jace on this.

19
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:22,586
No, or on anything else really.

20
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:24,156
Well, okay.

21
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:26,028
Good good, all right.

22
00:01:26,574 --> 00:01:28,624
Marie'll set up a meeting at...

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,290
10:00 p.m.

24
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:34,513
Marie, did you get that last part?

25
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:37,123
Good.
Okay, call Jace last.

26
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:38,383
Order food.

27
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:41,565
Any press, tell them
that we're working on a statement.

28
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,340
No, give me 40 minutes.

29
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:45,595
No calls, all right?

30
00:01:46,557 --> 00:01:48,007
All right.
Thanks.

31
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:49,427
Oh, what?

32
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:52,037
Yeah, I'll text Connie.

33
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:55,032
Oh, Jesus.

34
00:01:58,224 --> 00:02:00,174
Do you need a moment, Walter?

35
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:09,128
I'm not gone three days
and all hell breaks loose.

36
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:12,882
You know,
if it's an emergency, we can...

37
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,885
- We can reschedule.
- We've already rescheduled.

38
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,381
I was supposed to be here at 6:00.

39
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:21,066
It's 8:00.
No, it's after 8:00.

40
00:02:21,618 --> 00:02:22,968
I'm really sorry.

41
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:25,936
And I appreciate
you're seeing me later.

42
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,064
I know you must have a life
outside of here.

43
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,625
No, it's fine.
I had an hour free.

44
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:34,293
If you understood... if you really
understood how loath I am to be late.

45
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:36,912
I'm really sorry.
This isn't me at all.

46
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:38,437
Really, it's fine.

47
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:41,095
- Here.
- What's this?

48
00:02:42,024 --> 00:02:43,537
It's for your time.

49
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:47,788
- You're paying for the session in cash?
- No, it's not for the session.

50
00:02:47,913 --> 00:02:51,623
I'll write a check for that. This is...
This is just something extra for you.

51
00:02:51,748 --> 00:02:54,582
That's really not necessary, Walter.
Thank you.

52
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,719
Someone...

53
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:03,682
Unimpeachable, huh?
I like that.

54
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:06,306
- What do you mean?
- I wasn't trying to bribe you.

55
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:09,131
I mean, I'm...
That's not the way I operate.

56
00:03:09,362 --> 00:03:13,067
Although, I tell you, sometimes
it might be easier for me if I did.

57
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:14,380
I understand.

58
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,800
You were just trying to make up
for lost hours.

59
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:18,516
- I understand.
- Exactly.

60
00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:22,061
I know you value your time
and I've wasted some of it.

61
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:24,369
It was generous of you to offer.
Thank you, Walter.

62
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,708
- But I...
- Well, that's good.

63
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,633
You're a straight shooter.

64
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:31,869
That's a rare thing these days,

65
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:33,947
someone who's dependable.

66
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:36,882
I had to come to a walk-up
in Brooklyn to find it, but...

67
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:44,304
Marie, I said no calls,
for Christ's sake! Can't...

68
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:46,517
Are you sure?

69
00:03:48,238 --> 00:03:50,176
That son of a bitch.

70
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,163
No, don't let him know
that you've reached me.

71
00:03:55,288 --> 00:03:57,738
Just let him think
I'm walking into it.

72
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,657
I'll call you from the car.

73
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,277
Just give me a half hour of peace.

74
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:04,702
Can you do that?

75
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,480
Unbelievable.

76
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:11,038
This little pisser... Jace!

77
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:13,201
He's not even half my age

78
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:16,506
and somehow he thinks
he's gonna use this to bring me down.

79
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:21,315
He's so self-deluded he actually thinks
they're gonna give him my job.

80
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:24,054
- Walter, you seem...
- It's my own fault.

81
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,623
In a way.
I mean,

82
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:28,392
he was very bright, eager,

83
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:32,215
good schools.
I brought him into the company.

84
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,676
But he's green.
He's in over his head. It's...

85
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:38,277
Walter, can you listen to me
for a moment?

86
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:41,818
You seems like...

87
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,645
you seem like you're in the midst
of a breaking crisis here.

88
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,518
No, Paul, it's not breaking.

89
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:49,093
It's already broke.

90
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:52,164
We cull ingredients
from all over the world:

91
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:54,230
China,

92
00:04:54,764 --> 00:04:56,514
Brazil, Indonesia.

93
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,632
Somehow something
got into the pipeline.

94
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:02,226
Walter, whatever is going on...

95
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:04,981
it could be contaminated milk powder

96
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:07,859
or bacteria
from one of the factories.

97
00:05:07,984 --> 00:05:11,665
It could be a cheap lubricant leeching
into the machinery...

98
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:15,721
You don't seem like you're able
to get away from this right now.

99
00:05:15,846 --> 00:05:19,216
I think that it would be
a very good idea for us to reschedule.

100
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:20,441
Reschedule?!

101
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:21,718
When?

102
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:26,182
It's not gonna get any better
tomorrow or the day after.

103
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,569
Paul, I'm going into combat
in an hour.

104
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,953
And if I...
if I don't talk to you now,

105
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:36,770
it might be another month
before I get a chance.

106
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:46,056
It's off, okay?

107
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:50,015
Both of them.

108
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:55,721
- Can I get a glass of water?
- Sure.

109
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,112
I hate this stuff.

110
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,581
Connie's always telling me
I should drink more of it.

111
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,499
So does my doctor,
but I don't have time for it.

112
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:16,386
You don't have time to drink water?

113
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,184
Sometimes no, I don't.

114
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:20,671
And this week, it's a good thing anyway,
where I was.

115
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:22,469
You've been traveling?

116
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:27,787
I spent the last 44 out of 72 hours

117
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:29,847
in an airplane.

118
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:31,475
And

119
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:36,729
the hours waiting for the six flights
were no barrel of laughs either.

120
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:39,381
So the trip was in response to the...

121
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,350
To the crisis.

122
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:42,670
What?

123
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:46,780
Well, you were just saying how you have
suppliers all over the world,

124
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:48,755
and I assumed that you were

125
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:51,869
trying to track down
the source of the problem.

126
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,207
I wasn't flying for the company.

127
00:06:57,572 --> 00:07:00,794
- You weren't?
- No, I flew to Rwanda to get Natalie.

128
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,855
Did something happen to her?

129
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,472
No, she didn't say so.

130
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:12,723
But I knew that she was in trouble.

131
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:15,681
So

132
00:07:16,443 --> 00:07:19,275
she didn't ask you to come?

133
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,860
She didn't have to.
Look, Paul, she's... she's my daughter.

134
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,969
And until she went to Rwanda,

135
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:27,863
I had spoken with her
every day of her life.

136
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,253
Wherever I was in the world,

137
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,838
I'd call her at bedtime
and tell her I loved her.

138
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:35,504
Before she could talk,

139
00:07:36,574 --> 00:07:38,957
I made these little clicking noises.

140
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,830
Then after she went to Rwanda,
we emailed every day.

141
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:44,225
Suddenly,

142
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:47,153
Suddenly a week ago, she

143
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:50,565
writes her mother but not me.

144
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:52,930
Connie doesn't do email

145
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,273
so I had to print
the letters out for her.

146
00:07:56,023 --> 00:07:56,802
And

147
00:07:57,836 --> 00:07:59,728
she was asking Connie
if I was all right,

148
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:00,956
if

149
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:05,327
the company was really complicit
in this baby formula mess.

150
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,277
It was crazy talk.

151
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,656
Mightn't she have just been concerned
for your welfare?

152
00:08:10,882 --> 00:08:13,715
Well, Paul, don't you think
I know my own daughter?

153
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,042
That's not what I'm saying, Walter.

154
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:20,746
I'm just trying to understand why,

155
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:22,922
with your company in crisis,

156
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:25,546
you would chose to visit
your daughter in Rwanda.

157
00:08:25,732 --> 00:08:26,782
The emails,

158
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:30,307
her voice wasn't her voice.

159
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:32,845
She would never doubt her father.

160
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:36,461
Now I'm not saying
she's being brainwashed,

161
00:08:37,146 --> 00:08:38,851
but I knew she was hiding something

162
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,687
and once I got there
I found out I was right.

163
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:43,974
- What was she hiding?
- To start with,

164
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,574
she cut all her hair off.

165
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,306
She'd always had
this long auburn hair,

166
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:50,696
like my mother's
when she was that age.

167
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:54,144
Well, that's gone now.

168
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:57,369
Don't you think that's disturbing?

169
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:59,994
I can see
why you might find it so, yes.

170
00:09:03,162 --> 00:09:05,995
But cutting hair,
dyeing it weird colors,

171
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:09,547
lopping it off even, I mean,
that's what

172
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,892
what daughters do.

173
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,468
What else was different about her?

174
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:18,338
What was the same about her?

175
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:20,601
I didn't know who I was talking to.

176
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:22,556
She had no shoes.

177
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:24,980
She had given them away,
it turns out.

178
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:27,480
She was so thin.

179
00:09:30,818 --> 00:09:32,968
She had this child in her arms...

180
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:36,758
a little girl hanging in her arms
like a sack of potatoes.

181
00:09:38,803 --> 00:09:40,353
Are you okay, Walter?

182
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,695
This is where she's living, Paul.

183
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:48,975
This is where my daughter has chosen
to live... some hellhole near Goma.

184
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,406
When she saw you, how did she react?

185
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,355
I don't think I spoke right away.
I just stood there

186
00:09:57,245 --> 00:09:58,639
looking at her.

187
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,038
Finally she got scared.

188
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,882
She said, "What is it?
Mom? Is mom all right?"

189
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:06,537
And I said, "Your mother's fine".
She said, "What are you doing here?"

190
00:10:06,662 --> 00:10:09,024
And I said,
"I've come to take you home.

191
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:11,999
- "Get your stuff."
- And that didn't go down well?

192
00:10:12,124 --> 00:10:13,774
No. At first she was...

193
00:10:14,468 --> 00:10:15,468
distant.

194
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:19,989
"Dad, I can't leave right now.
I have to finish a procedure."

195
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:23,956
As if she'd got some medical degree
in the last month.

196
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:27,968
She said she'd meet me for dinner
in a few hours in the big tent.

197
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,424
Then she pointed
in the direction of some little shacks

198
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:33,710
in case I wanted to lie down.

199
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:36,397
She was living
in one of those shacks.

200
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:39,722
They looked like outhouses
and she was sleeping there.

201
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,291
I can see how upsetting that...

202
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:44,980
that might have been for you.

203
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,650
I mean, you spent your life...

204
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:50,206
providing a good home for her and...

205
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,584
this is how she chooses to live.

206
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,525
So what happened at the dinner?

207
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:57,717
Well, I didn't wait for dinner.

208
00:10:57,842 --> 00:11:01,226
I went back into the shack
and I took all her stuff and...

209
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:02,901
I put it in the jeep.

210
00:11:03,468 --> 00:11:04,468
I just...

211
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:07,323
I just wanted to take it back

212
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:09,334
with me to Kigali and at least

213
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,230
have her clothes cleaned.

214
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:16,554
I wanted to go back
to the hotel that night and...

215
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,720
take her to dinner
and maybe talk some sense into her.

216
00:11:20,004 --> 00:11:21,795
The next thing I know, she's...

217
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,948
tearing across this field,
screaming at me

218
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:26,323
insane stuff...

219
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:28,586
How I'm trying to control her,

220
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:30,707
how I don't respect her,

221
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,923
how she's worked so hard to build up
trust with these people and now...

222
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:38,739
they're gonna think
that she's some neocolonialist

223
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:40,062
like me.

224
00:11:40,437 --> 00:11:43,730
And there was something about Connie
I'm not even going to repeat.

225
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:48,462
I swear to god, Paul, it took
everything I had not to slap her.

226
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:52,553
Instead I just said, "Don't you
ever speak about your mother like that".

227
00:11:53,223 --> 00:11:54,109
Then...

228
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,631
she broke down and started to cry.

229
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:59,438
What did you do then?

230
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:01,482
I put my arms around her.

231
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:05,107
I said, "Natalie, we're going home".

232
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:06,332
And then...

233
00:12:10,075 --> 00:12:12,075
she told me to go fuck myself.

234
00:12:15,673 --> 00:12:18,695
She'd never said
anything like that to you before?

235
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,100
She broke my heart, Paul.

236
00:12:26,097 --> 00:12:27,547
She broke my heart.

237
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:39,131
Why do you think
she was so angry with you?

238
00:12:40,915 --> 00:12:42,765
She made that pretty clear.

239
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,840
I got an email from her
when I got back to the hotel.

240
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:51,520
It turns out that I'm domineering,

241
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,893
obsessive,

242
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:55,568
that I'm the cause
of all her anxieties,

243
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,651
that it's impossible to thrive
or grow around me, and...

244
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:03,464
that's why she had to go away
and now I'm...

245
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:06,959
ruining her only chance
to free herself from me.

246
00:13:09,358 --> 00:13:11,065
Now you see why I went over there?

247
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,990
I sensed this was coming
from earlier emails.

248
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:20,882
You know,
hearing that email makes me...

249
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,596
Can we talk about the way
you... came in here today?

250
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:30,631
Completely in charge on both phones,

251
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:33,305
handing me your bag...

252
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:36,716
Not quite like I was a bellhop,
but...

253
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,901
something like that.

254
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:42,946
- I'm sorry if I offended you.
- No, you didn't offend me. But...

255
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:44,871
it did catch my attention.

256
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:48,236
Walter, we both know that...

257
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:49,774
you are...

258
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,706
an excellent... manager.

259
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,265
World class.

260
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:55,890
Right?

261
00:13:56,524 --> 00:13:58,371
But in other roles where...

262
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:00,744
you're not entirely in control,

263
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:03,169
like say being a patient here, or...

264
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,546
maybe when you went to see Natalie.

265
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,390
That's much less comfortable
for you.

266
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:13,928
But what are you saying?
I never try to control Natalie.

267
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,394
- I gave her whatever she wanted.
- Of course.

268
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:19,466
You've given her everything.

269
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:21,651
And that's...

270
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:25,347
That's something that's hard
for other parents to do but...

271
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:26,406
not for you.

272
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,908
Do you think it's possible that...

273
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,224
what's hard for you is...

274
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:34,293
just... letting her be?

275
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:36,975
Letting her go?

276
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:39,201
Did you think that...

277
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,603
you felt her pulling away from you
in those emails?

278
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:46,879
And then when you saw her
at the camp did you...

279
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:49,068
did you get frightened?

280
00:14:49,393 --> 00:14:52,609
Scared... of losing her
so that you felt you had to tell her

281
00:14:52,734 --> 00:14:54,559
to pack up her things and come home?

282
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:57,781
Can't a father worry
about his own daughter?

283
00:14:57,906 --> 00:14:59,256
Of course he can.

284
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,963
But just look at...

285
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:04,063
how you responded for a moment.

286
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:09,115
In the midst of a major work crisis,
you read an email

287
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:13,128
that she wrote to Connie and without
stopping to think, you get on a plane

288
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:15,653
and you fly halfway
around the world.

289
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:19,685
It's all right.

290
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:22,941
These work pretty quick.

291
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,070
Xanax, it's...

292
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:28,648
Dr. Wells gave me the prescription.

293
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:30,856
Thank God he did.

294
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:35,485
Otherwise
I'd never have been able to...

295
00:15:35,862 --> 00:15:37,462
get out of that place.

296
00:15:57,246 --> 00:15:58,846
Did you take a pill...

297
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,001
after you saw Natalie?

298
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:03,551
Later.

299
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,050
I woke up in the middle of the night

300
00:16:07,222 --> 00:16:08,522
in a cold sweat.

301
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:10,889
I had a nightmare...

302
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,422
that Natalie was gone.

303
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:17,499
Then I looked around me
and with the...

304
00:16:17,624 --> 00:16:19,608
jetlag and the fatigue,

305
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:22,233
I had no idea
where I was for a minute.

306
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:25,788
I thought I was...
back in my parents' house,

307
00:16:25,913 --> 00:16:27,213
in Tommy's room,

308
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,779
with all his sports trophies
and awards.

309
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:34,754
I just couldn't stay in that room
another second.

310
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,835
I had to get out of there.
I was having trouble breathing.

311
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:40,912
And then I remembered the pills.

312
00:16:42,105 --> 00:16:44,755
Do you think it's strange
that you were...

313
00:16:45,406 --> 00:16:47,152
that you were thinking about...

314
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,207
Tommy over there...

315
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:50,425
in Africa?

316
00:16:52,994 --> 00:16:54,894
He's been on my mind lately.

317
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:57,807
Do you know when that started?

318
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:02,275
Has it been since Natalie left?

319
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,819
You said that you woke up
and you felt that you had to get out.

320
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:12,317
Hotels can be disorienting.

321
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,599
But losing Tommy was...

322
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,743
very painful for you, wasn't it?

323
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:19,019
My folks had the pain.

324
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:23,041
With all due respect,
when parents lose a child it kills them.

325
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:30,356
It's really admirable that you remained
so close to your parents

326
00:17:30,997 --> 00:17:32,497
after that happened.

327
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:34,857
Like with the Donaldsons,

328
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:36,788
as you've said.

329
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:39,091
After their son James died,

330
00:17:41,115 --> 00:17:43,546
you became like a son to them.

331
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,700
The good son,

332
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:48,616
the one everybody can depend on.

333
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:52,682
And then you had this dream.
And...

334
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:55,478
you feel
that you're suffocating in...

335
00:17:56,445 --> 00:17:57,745
in Tommy's room.

336
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,707
What does this have to do
with Natalie?

337
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,415
Maybe Natalie
is trying to do something

338
00:18:06,274 --> 00:18:08,874
that you've never
allowed yourself to do:

339
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,690
to separate from her parents.

340
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:15,441
For you to stay connected
means to never...

341
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:16,833
stray.

342
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:21,459
Now Natalie is trying to do something
in between, but you feel

343
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:23,334
that she's abandoning you

344
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:25,909
the way Tommy did.

345
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:29,126
He died, Paul.
Jesus.

346
00:18:29,846 --> 00:18:32,043
- He didn't abandon me.
- I know.

347
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,752
But maybe that night in the hotel,
Natalie's separation

348
00:18:35,877 --> 00:18:36,927
from you...

349
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:38,647
felt,

350
00:18:39,303 --> 00:18:40,403
in some way,

351
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:44,956
- it felt like a death.
- God forbid.

352
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,642
There's no comparison.

353
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:50,803
There's a big difference.

354
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,548
When a child dies, he's gone.

355
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,738
Isn't that exactly the nightmare that
woke you up, that Natalie was gone?

356
00:18:58,278 --> 00:18:59,929
It wasn't the same.

357
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,417
I was trying to find her.

358
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:06,224
I knew that no matter
how bad I felt,

359
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:10,200
I had to put myself aside
and think only of Natalie.

360
00:19:11,644 --> 00:19:12,994
I took the pills.

361
00:19:13,355 --> 00:19:15,473
And somehow it passed.
And...

362
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,496
I dragged myself
back to the hotel lobby

363
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:21,337
and I went online
in the business center.

364
00:19:22,677 --> 00:19:25,577
That's when I read her emails
and I realized...

365
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,150
I realized...

366
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,427
You realized what, Walter?
It's okay to have the...

367
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,926
thought here.
You can say whatever you like.

368
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:39,489
I realized
that she didn't need me at all.

369
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:42,374
Or maybe that's just
what she needs to feel right now.

370
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:45,176
She's done with her old man.

371
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:47,297
I'm a booster rocket.

372
00:19:47,422 --> 00:19:50,957
She's launched, like your boys, isn't
that what you said at our first session?

373
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,699
Did I? I'm sure I also said
that Natalie was different.

374
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,334
I'd have to agree with you.

375
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:58,154
You did raise her with the freedom
to think for herself,

376
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,503
to question authority figures,
to confront the world of adults.

377
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:06,246
You gave her an incredible gift.
Now she wants to use it.

378
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:09,189
- By telling me to go fuck myself?
- That's what you heard.

379
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:12,287
But before that, she wanted you
to talk things over with her.

380
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:15,361
- She invited you to dinner, no?
- She was just shining me on.

381
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:17,636
Possibly.
Or possibly she really

382
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:19,418
wanted to talk to you.

383
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:23,322
But you felt like she was disrespecting
you and you reacted to that.

384
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,730
You know, I think that...

385
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:28,755
for her whole life
she's been very aware of you

386
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:32,943
and how you feel and what you think
and what she can do to make you happy.

387
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:35,535
Maybe part of the reason
she's so angry is because

388
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,421
maybe for the first time in her life
she knows that...

389
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:41,194
what she wants...
is not what you want.

390
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:45,660
And she's having a very hard time
reconciling herself to that fact.

391
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,579
She's having a hard time?

392
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:48,997
What about me?

393
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:51,791
- So how did you leave things with her?
- I didn't.

394
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:56,588
I woke up the next morning to a barrage
of incoming faxes, phone calls,

395
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:59,622
emails, outbreaks of diarrhea,

396
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,011
children in hospitals
possibly from formula contaminated

397
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,729
at one of our plants.

398
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,755
I'd gotten out in front of this!

399
00:21:08,943 --> 00:21:10,893
I leave for a few days and...

400
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:14,314
it's like they were just waiting for me
to turn my back.

401
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,639
I'm sorry, Walter.

402
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:24,490
With the late session,
I forgot to shut the...

403
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:30,509
<i>Hello, this is Mr. Barnett's assistant,
Marie.</i>

404
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:32,980
<i>It's urgent
that he speaks with Burt.</i>

405
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:35,543
<i>If he calls me,
I can patch him through.</i>

406
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:39,038
Back to battle stations.

407
00:21:39,163 --> 00:21:40,663
I'd better be going.

408
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,300
Thank you.

409
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,339
26 messages.

410
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:48,248
Will you be all right?

411
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:53,292
I'll be fine.
They can't get rid of me, Paul.

412
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:56,397
<i>Après moi, le déluge.</i>

413
00:21:57,032 --> 00:21:58,639
After you, the flood?

414
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:01,199
That's a lot of pressure.

415
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:04,058
The glue, Paul, the glue.

416
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:07,126
Just look what happened when I left.

417
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:10,049
I guess...

418
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:13,177
my daughter can survive
without me but...

419
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,208
the Donaldsons can't.

420
00:22:20,742 --> 00:22:22,492
Will I see you next week?

421
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,079
Yeah, and thanks again.

422
00:22:24,204 --> 00:22:25,454
You're welcome.

423
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,419
Call Burt and...

424
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:37,946
What do you mean you can't get him?

425
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:41,271
You just left me a message
he wants to speak with me.

426
00:22:41,888 --> 00:22:43,538
What about the old man?
