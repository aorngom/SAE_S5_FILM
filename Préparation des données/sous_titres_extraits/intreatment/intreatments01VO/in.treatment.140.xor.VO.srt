<i>Previously, on</i> In Treatment...

2
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:06,000
You know, you've never once
taken responsibility for what you did.

3
00:00:06,262 --> 00:00:08,961
You never once said:
"I'm sorry, I made a mistake."

4
00:00:09,223 --> 00:00:10,786
He's not willing to forgive me

5
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:13,300
because he hasn't made up his mind
about this woman yet.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,259
Another thing
we haven't talked about:

7
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:17,715
the kind of mother you've been.
Can we talk about it?

8
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:21,361
You should really be quiet right now.
You're sort of embarrassing yourself.

9
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:23,392
You said that I might have pushed

10
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:27,521
Kate into her affair
because of my feelings for Laura.

11
00:00:27,783 --> 00:00:30,858
- Maybe it's the other way around.
- You're both going through something.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,943
She's struggling with the dynamic

13
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:34,903
that existing before you met.

14
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:37,531
And you're looking
for that younger woman

15
00:00:37,793 --> 00:00:40,618
who looks up to you
the way Kate used to.

16
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:43,607
That's great. That's just really great.

17
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:52,180
How are you?

18
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:54,715
So obviously, Kate

19
00:00:54,977 --> 00:00:56,898
isn't coming today?

20
00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:58,927
Yes, she left me a message.

21
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:01,472
She really didn't go
into why, though.

22
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:05,017
She said that she was tired
of going back and forth,

23
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:08,646
and just tired to try to find out
who has started what

24
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:11,273
and who's guilty of what
and who's reacting to what...

25
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:14,318
She wants to decide
on her own, basically.

26
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:17,780
I have to respect that.

Week 8 - Episode 40.

30
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:39,550
How do you think
our sessions with Kate went?

31
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,647
I'd say they were chaotic.

32
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:44,668
I was a little annoyed with you
over that but I suppose

33
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,308
I'm partly at fault too.

34
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:50,781
And I also think that she felt
sandwiched between two therapists.

35
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:53,482
I do have to say though

36
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:57,194
that you did manage to make connections
that resonated with both of us,

37
00:01:57,456 --> 00:01:59,071
especially with Kate.

38
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,080
Whether anything is gonna come
off that I don't...

39
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,051
I don't really know.

40
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:08,531
You know who I envy?

41
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,449
Writers.

42
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:13,919
They create these characters
that they want to spend time with

43
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:16,370
and then they decide if they're gonna

44
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,573
let them live or die,
or let them be happy

45
00:02:19,743 --> 00:02:22,970
or unhappy,
let them be failures or successes.

46
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:25,199
You wanna write everybody's
story for them?

47
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,617
I really think I'd be a shitty writer.

48
00:02:28,787 --> 00:02:31,437
I'd want to give everybody
a happy ending.

49
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:40,404
I'm very sorry about your patient.

50
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,654
Yeah... Thanks.

51
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:50,622
Not the ending
I would have written for him.

52
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,919
The funeral, Jesus Christ.

53
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:56,462
I'd forgotten how awful funerals are.

54
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:58,617
That dreadful sense that...

55
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:02,426
That in the end,
there's only silence...

56
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:06,305
You think as therapists, we'd have
better tools to walk through it.

57
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:09,616
Well, I don't.
I feel the same sense of...

58
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:14,021
futility and hopelessness
as the next guy.

59
00:03:15,564 --> 00:03:19,359
You know what's also interesting
is seeing the relatives of patients

60
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:22,362
you've treated. Their participance
in the stories that you've heard

61
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:26,100
a dozen of times, the father,
the son, the brother, whoever.

62
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:30,621
We think we know them.
But we don't really know them at all.

63
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:34,702
We know reactions of them,
the versions of them

64
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,503
idealized or vilified....

65
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:39,954
I was really struggling to reconcile

66
00:03:40,124 --> 00:03:42,466
this image that I had of Alex's wife

67
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:44,652
with the woman that I saw there.

68
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:47,347
He always described her
as a demanding, exacting

69
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:50,224
a constant source of pressure
in his life.

70
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:52,944
But I looked over
and I just saw this...

71
00:03:56,206 --> 00:03:57,398
broken woman.

72
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:00,276
She seems so soft and gentle.

73
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,612
'Cause I'll never really know her now.

74
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:05,782
- Does that bother you?
- It does bother me.

75
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:08,419
I ask myself all the time
if I actually know

76
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:10,622
what I think I know
about my patients' lives.

77
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,849
That couple, for example.

78
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,606
The one who were trying to have

79
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,085
the baby. Amy.

80
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,129
I don't think
she can ever really be known.

81
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:23,959
I mean, there are certain patterns
that identified themselves

82
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:25,468
from her past.

83
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,345
But I cannot...

84
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:29,267
shrink her.

85
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:33,017
She's too complicated.
And then I say to myself:

86
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:35,663
"Do I really know
any of these people?

87
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,677
"Or are they all just one big fiction

88
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:41,813
"that I've constructed in my head,"
you know?

89
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:44,737
Sometimes I dream
about the family members

90
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:46,965
of patients that I'm treating.

91
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:50,061
- People I've never met.
- Yeah, it's curious.

92
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:52,265
Apart from your....

93
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:54,831
intense connection
with your patients,

94
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:57,065
you're also now talking about

95
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:01,091
I don't know, longing
for your patients' family and friends.

96
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:04,361
What do you mean by that,
"a longing"?

97
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:06,649
Maybe that's not the right word.

98
00:05:07,603 --> 00:05:10,638
Do you mean curiosity
about the lives of other people?

99
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:14,559
Isn't that an aspect of what we do?
It's just... It's curiosity.

100
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:17,319
We're supposed to be fascinated

101
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:19,731
by how people behave. At least...

102
00:05:21,006 --> 00:05:22,460
At least I think so.

103
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:29,647
Alex's death left me
with this very strong feeling

104
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:31,266
that I was like...

105
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:33,716
a repository, really. A trustee.

106
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:39,626
The things that he never told
anybody else, his private thoughts.

107
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:42,528
They've stayed with me,
they're inside me.

108
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:45,173
A big part of his life is

109
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:47,592
is in vault I have inside me.

110
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:49,531
No. A part of his life,

111
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:52,066
maybe,
but not necessarily a big part.

112
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:56,267
- You were his therapist.
- Only his therapist.

113
00:05:56,527 --> 00:05:59,896
I know you've always been
of two minds in relation to this

114
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:01,447
that therapy is

115
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:04,379
more than a discipline,
that it's actually a religion,

116
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:07,804
but you also say we're therapists,
so we can't really...

117
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,574
run our patients lives for them.
As soon as they walk out the door,

118
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:13,915
they're on their own, yeah?

119
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:22,502
How would you describe Alex's
state of mind when you last saw him?

120
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:25,196
I'd say he was pretty fragile,

121
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:27,352
if I remember well, yeah.

122
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:31,454
The ironic thing is that we'd really
made some good progress, and he just...

123
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,989
seemed to regress. It was like...

124
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,538
He felt that he was so close
to a breakthrough

125
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,795
that it scared him.
It was too much, and he just...

126
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:45,108
He turned away from it really.

127
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:49,070
Are you feeling in any way
responsible for his death?

128
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:58,432
You know, I'm friendly
with a psychiatrist

129
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:00,623
that consults for the Navy,
Alfonso Casilles.

130
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:02,642
- You remember him?
- Yeah.

131
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:05,253
Well, I asked him
if he could find out anything.

132
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:06,771
He said vertigo.

133
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:10,091
It means that there's nothing wrong
with the equipment.

134
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:12,361
They were doing
some kind of combat exercise.

135
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:14,505
The plane he was chasing descended,

136
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:18,017
Alex went into what they call vertigo
and lost control.

137
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:20,533
That's their...

138
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:22,603
official conclusion.

139
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,347
- I think he killed himself.
- How can you be sure of that?

140
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:32,739
Look, his life was a tragedy
from the second he was born.

141
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:35,867
His childhood,
his relationship with his father, up to

142
00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:38,494
when he pushed the button
and killed a room full of kids.

143
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:40,644
How do you live with that?

144
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:44,333
Even with the gadgets that they have
now, they reduce people to dots

145
00:07:44,593 --> 00:07:47,059
on a video screen.
All the spin from the Navy,

146
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:50,158
none of it made any difference to him.
It didn't work on him.

147
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:53,764
He felt every single one
of those deaths, I know he did.

148
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:00,784
So many expectations...

149
00:08:03,387 --> 00:08:05,312
The best and the brightest.

150
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:08,384
He was.

151
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:11,262
He was...

152
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:13,187
so strong physically,

153
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:14,818
handsome,

154
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,605
intelligent. Under all that...

155
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:19,746
kind of posturing

156
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,666
and male posing that he did,
he was really...

157
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:29,379
He was a good guy.

158
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:32,227
Charming.

159
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:37,055
He was endearing, you know.
He looked and he sounded like

160
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:39,388
what they call a winner.

161
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,808
Suddenly, he becomes a murderer.

162
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:43,818
How do you reconcile that?

163
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:49,148
- I think that's what really killed him.
- "Endearing"?

164
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:52,689
I have never heard you
talk about him like that.

165
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:54,324
Quite the opposite.

166
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:56,489
Actually,
he was kind of a funny guy.

167
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:57,699
He was...

168
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:02,395
I don't know.
Am I already beginning to...

169
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:04,747
idealizing? Yeah, maybe.

170
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,892
Well, it's not uncommon,

171
00:09:07,662 --> 00:09:09,124
after such a shock.

172
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:12,171
He gave me the chance
to stop him from flying.

173
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:13,219
Literally?

174
00:09:13,593 --> 00:09:15,591
Did he really offer that
or are you projecting?

175
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:18,594
He asked me directly, "Should I fly?"

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,156
What did you say?

177
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,699
I told him
I was very concerned about his...

178
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:25,476
- About his state of mind.
- You said that clearly?

179
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:30,583
But he wanted me to say it
unequivocally. "Do not fly".

180
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:32,484
It's not your place, Paul.

181
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:36,896
A patient can't ask you
to take his life into your hands.

182
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:39,574
It's not your place to say; "Don't fly".

183
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:44,207
Anymore than it's your place to say
to that couple, "Have an abortion".

184
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:47,915
Or to Laura,
"Marry or don't marry your fiancé".

185
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:51,460
I should have sent the Navy
an evaluation.

186
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:54,995
"Guilt-ridden. Wants to punish himself.
Shouldn't fly."

187
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,892
Alex's dad came into the office to...

188
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:02,096
To talk.

189
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:06,931
So I had this poor guy yelling at me,
saying that his son's repression

190
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:10,225
was what had kept him alive
all the time

191
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:13,906
and that therapy, the stuff
that he was doing with me, was...

192
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:19,042
- The therapy was what had killed him.
- Oh God, Paul.

193
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:23,175
Up in the air at Mach 5,
he's not supposed to have emotions.

194
00:10:23,502 --> 00:10:27,440
He's not supposed to think.
That's actually why he crashed.

195
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:34,673
He was very different
from what I imagined also.

196
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,678
He was riddled, you know,
with his own guilt.

197
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:42,359
Actually, he did make
a couple of good points.

198
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:45,680
He said things were in the unconscious
for a reason because the mind

199
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:48,796
can not live or breathe
or take a single step

200
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:51,621
if everything
that lies dormant in it were...

201
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,752
out there in daylight, fully lay out.

202
00:10:53,922 --> 00:10:56,999
That a fully conscious human being
would be paralyzed,

203
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:58,856
would be like a cripple.

204
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,406
Alex didn't need to be conscious,

205
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,984
but just merely efficient.

206
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:10,672
Do you really accept that?
That life is better lived unexamined.

207
00:11:11,592 --> 00:11:12,725
And when...

208
00:11:13,388 --> 00:11:16,906
anxiety and fear and pain
bubble up from below,

209
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:20,434
how can that be dealt with,
except by looking at it?

210
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:22,260
Except by analyzing it?

211
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:24,929
We don't run the show, Paul.

212
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:26,848
I sometimes think

213
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:29,725
that therapists can start
to imagine they're like writers,

214
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:33,051
you know,
that they can control the outcome.

215
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:37,441
We don't live their lives for them,
we don't even live them with them.

216
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:40,170
I know that you want to believe
that we really do have

217
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,655
an influence that's always positive.

218
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:45,827
- We help people to understand.
- Understand what they're feeling

219
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:49,126
and after that, if they make
a wrong turn, then it's not our fault,

220
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:50,710
it's human error.

221
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,715
But...

222
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:53,165
Anyway.

223
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:56,085
- Who're you really angry at?
- Myself, obviously.

224
00:11:56,754 --> 00:12:00,498
You.
Every therapist from Freud to Mitchell.

225
00:12:00,668 --> 00:12:01,468
Why?

226
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:06,137
Because we force patients
to look at themselves

227
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:09,477
and pat ourselves on the back for it.

228
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:12,039
Then we say to them,
"Here's what's wrong with you,

229
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:13,519
"now off you go."

230
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,523
Did you feel this way before Alex died?

231
00:12:17,783 --> 00:12:19,025
More or less, yeah.

232
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:21,610
Has it been on your mind recently
in any other context?

233
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,820
Like what?

234
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,129
I'm asking. Have...

235
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:28,240
other patients, other than Alex
made you think like this?

236
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,567
- You're insinuating.
- No, I'm just trying to get a sense,

237
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:33,093
a history...

238
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:36,751
of these feelings about psychotherapy.

239
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:39,701
You mean, if I've been wondering
for a while if our...

240
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:42,673
profession is actually helpful
to people?

241
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:45,634
Yes, I have.
I think about it every day.

242
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,889
So you feel
you're not able to help your patients?

243
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,509
The gymnast, for example, Sophie?

244
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:57,395
Honestly, I feel
like she made a lot of progress.

245
00:12:57,565 --> 00:13:00,181
We connected,
there was a bound between us.

246
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:02,401
But I think
it was the personal relationship

247
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,711
that helped her,
not the therapeutic process.

248
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:07,858
You know, maybe Yallom is right.

249
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:11,027
Maybe it is the relationship
that actually heals.

250
00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:15,611
But that other couple, Jake and Amy,
I can not tell you, honestly,

251
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:19,108
if they're better off together or apart.

252
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,786
I don't know if I helped them at all.

253
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:25,828
Anyway.

254
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:30,429
Are you okay, Paul?

255
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:33,015
I think I'm tired, Gina.

256
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:34,913
Put your feet up.

257
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:53,569
You know Alex said...
He was talking about...

258
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:55,961
vertigo and he said that

259
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,241
when it happens,

260
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:01,763
they're supposed to trust
their instruments and not their senses.

261
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:02,962
That's right.

262
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,327
- How do you know that?
- I once had a boyfriend

263
00:14:06,497 --> 00:14:08,411
who was a commercial pilot.

264
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,082
This is before David.

265
00:14:10,874 --> 00:14:12,138
He taught me that.

266
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:15,799
Among other things.

267
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,250
Yes, Paul.

268
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:23,436
I have been more than a sleepy spider.

269
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,647
So it seems.

270
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:32,491
Anyway, I think it's the opposite
for a psychologist.

271
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:36,120
I think we'd be far more effective
if we relied less on

272
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:40,783
instruments and theories and books
and more on our own instincts.

273
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:45,588
So all your training, all your knowledge
can lead you astray?

274
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,714
I think so.

275
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:52,428
Do you feel this generally
or about certain patients in particular?

276
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:56,075
What do you mean? What is it, Gina?

277
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:58,134
What?

278
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,896
You've got that look of yours.

279
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:05,065
- What look is that?
- You have the look that says

280
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:06,845
"I have a theory".

281
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:09,945
- Regarding what?
- Come on, Gina,

282
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:12,250
cut the crap.
Just tell me what you think.

283
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,075
I'm just sitting here, listening to you.
I'm listening

284
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:18,621
to your newfound theories
about the uselessness of psychotherapy.

285
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:22,291
"Certain patients in particular"?

286
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,965
Come on. We're back to Laura, again.

287
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:31,955
Are we?

288
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,678
You think
everything is a reaction to Laura.

289
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:38,098
- What's a reaction?
- Me criticizing psychology,

290
00:15:38,358 --> 00:15:40,964
dismissing theories.
You think I'm making an excuse.

291
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:44,230
Even Alex getting killed,
that's an excuse, right?

292
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,680
Psychology is collapsing so

293
00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:50,486
I might as well sleep with Laura.
I think that's kind of the way you're...

294
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:52,821
- Is that what I'm thinking?
- Am I wrong?

295
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:56,367
When you guess what I'm thinking
it's always about Laura.

296
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:59,099
Like I assume
that everything you say

297
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:00,996
- is connected to her.
- Don't you?

298
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:03,666
You're the one who brought her up.

299
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:05,876
I'm not talking about Laura.

300
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:08,379
I'm talking about the fact that...

301
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,014
I am having trouble lately
believing in this...

302
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,801
- religion of yours.
- Of mine?

303
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:18,556
I don't think traditional psychology
answers anything anymore.

304
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:22,511
You have two extremes, right?
You have pop psychology,

305
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,754
you've got these celebrity therapists

306
00:16:24,924 --> 00:16:27,565
writing best-sellers,
getting on talk shows,

307
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:30,571
making some miserable couple
wipe on television.

308
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,687
It's kind of a pornography. And then,
on the other hand, you've got

309
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:34,947
the experts.

310
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:37,861
Psychologists like you, orthodox.

311
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,535
Authority figures.

312
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:42,523
Everything under control and supervised,

313
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:45,791
examined under a bright light,
examined to death.

314
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:50,212
Completely and utterly divorced
from real life.

315
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,131
Am I divorced from real life?

316
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:54,800
Gina,
you've never lived outside this room!

317
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,399
The Institute,

318
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,387
the graduate program,

319
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:00,779
David's world and after David...

320
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:03,045
died, you locked yourself up in here.

321
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:05,534
I mean, it's a beautiful room.
Look at it.

322
00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:08,740
Beautifully appointed,
everything is in its place.

323
00:17:09,092 --> 00:17:11,900
But you sit in here,
and what do you do?

324
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,815
You write fiction!

325
00:17:14,526 --> 00:17:17,573
About how life could have been,
should have been.

326
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:20,650
Is that what I'm writing?

327
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,078
Just ask yourself, as a therapist,

328
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:27,207
can you really help anybody,
if you live in a bubble?

329
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:30,502
So now, I'm a sleepy spider in a bubble?

330
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:33,047
Look, I don't want to upset you Gina,
I...

331
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:34,526
You won't.

332
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,169
I forgot, of course...

333
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:40,202
You don't get upset.

334
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:42,347
You never lose it.

335
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,636
I've lost it here with you,

336
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:49,801
several times in the past few weeks.

337
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:58,572
- Why are you trying to provoke me?
- I am not trying to provoke you.

338
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,909
I just don't want to end up like this.

339
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:03,340
Is this it?

340
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:09,750
Is this how therapists
live out their lives?

341
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,002
You are perverse.

342
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:15,731
You know, something real and powerful
came into your life,

343
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:17,653
and you never gave it a chance.

344
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:20,377
Not for Charlie's sake or for yours.

345
00:18:21,363 --> 00:18:23,514
I know you said it was
because he was a patient.

346
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:25,426
But you know what I think?

347
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:27,225
I think it was bullshit.

348
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:30,201
- Paul, be careful.
- You were terrified.

349
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,501
Charlie told me that you were
the biggest loss in his life.

350
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:38,563
That his whole life
could have been different.

351
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:41,657
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

352
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:48,577
And after all these years, Paul,

353
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:50,457
you don't know me.

354
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:55,938
You wanna know what I struggle with?

355
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:59,013
It's not that I'm too reserved,

356
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:01,068
too detached,

357
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:04,812
it's that I'm too emotional.

358
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:07,891
I'm impulsive and emotional.

359
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,237
And I give myself over right away.
And passionately.

360
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:13,628
I pour myself out.

361
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:18,193
Can't you see
that I'm protecting myself?

362
00:19:19,217 --> 00:19:22,651
Because I'm afraid I get carried away,
I won't be able to think,

363
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:25,534
I won't be able to analyze,
I won't be able to work.

364
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,905
You've created this cold version of me

365
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:32,559
that's limiting and castrating.

366
00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:35,436
Because,

367
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:38,628
when you're arguing with me,

368
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,759
you want to see yourself as battling
the forces of repression.

369
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:45,758
And if the truth is

370
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:49,801
that I am an emotional person
who has to rein herself in,

371
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:53,061
it doesn't fit with what you need now,
does it?

372
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:06,751
Of course, I wanted Charlie.

373
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,478
He was the most alive person I ever met.

374
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,698
I wanted to sleep with him,
I wanted to eat him up.

375
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:21,006
But I didn't.

376
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:24,750
And not because of ethics.

377
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:29,799
I may have told him
that it was because he was a patient.

378
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:32,672
But the real reason was David.

379
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:36,605
Even though David cheated on me for...
however many years.

380
00:20:40,354 --> 00:20:41,927
I knew that all along.

381
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,452
He was really shitty at hiding it.

382
00:20:47,403 --> 00:20:49,753
I didn't sleep with Charlie because...

383
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:54,227
that's not who I wanted to be.

384
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:59,035
I loved David,
and I loved the life we had.

385
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,696
And who I was with him.
I loved myself with David.

386
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:06,288
David's Gina.

387
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:18,063
And you know what?

388
00:21:23,912 --> 00:21:25,811
When I was standing over...

389
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,213
his grave at funeral,

390
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:35,218
I felt...

391
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:40,243
if I was magically reborn,

392
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:44,217
I would choose him all over again.

393
00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:50,470
For all his faults,

394
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:55,477
he allowed me to be
who I wanted to be.

395
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,109
I'm surprised you didn't see it.

396
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:07,460
How crazy I was about him.

397
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:09,750
He was everything.

398
00:22:13,057 --> 00:22:15,941
- I never heard you say it.
- Oh shit!

399
00:22:16,855 --> 00:22:18,748
Everything has to be said?

400
00:22:22,362 --> 00:22:25,816
Then now, I have to sit here
and listen to your crappy,

401
00:22:25,986 --> 00:22:28,194
nearsighted, self-involved

402
00:22:28,793 --> 00:22:31,258
theories about my life.

403
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,389
Oh, God.

404
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:39,150
Listen to us.

405
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:41,270
You know, I slap you,

406
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:42,938
and you punch me.

407
00:22:46,525 --> 00:22:49,348
Sometimes I tell myself
it's constructive but,

408
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:53,784
you know, I'm not so sure anymore,
maybe we should stop.

409
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:02,665
You've been fighting me for two months.

410
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:05,562
Saying Laura, Laura, Laura.

411
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:10,296
And you've been waiting
for this imaginary Gina of yours

412
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:12,652
to jump in and stop you?

413
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:21,202
I'm not what's stopping you.

414
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,783
You're fighting yourself.

415
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:29,078
It's up to you, it's like Alex.

416
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,949
You carefully looked at his life,
you opened doors for him.

417
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,204
You gave him insight.

418
00:23:37,212 --> 00:23:38,902
But his life was his.

419
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:41,720
And he decided to fly.

420
00:23:44,154 --> 00:23:45,790
Now, you decide.

421
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,503
Perhaps, you're right.

422
00:23:48,673 --> 00:23:51,708
Maybe love can bloom
in a therapist office.

423
00:23:53,895 --> 00:23:57,237
Ethics and rules,
love is bigger than any rules.

424
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:01,101
And what do I know?

425
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,240
Maybe she's your David.

426
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:07,951
Maybe you can only be the Paul
you want to be...

427
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:09,125
with her.

428
00:24:12,027 --> 00:24:12,827
So,

429
00:24:13,197 --> 00:24:14,243
go to her.

430
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:17,653
Find out.

431
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:22,638
But please,

432
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:26,837
stop comparing your life to mine.

433
00:24:30,665 --> 00:24:32,841
Stop using Charlie against me.

434
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:37,525
I'm sorry he was hurt by what happened.

435
00:24:39,322 --> 00:24:42,257
But I never loved him. Not for a day.

436
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,404
I loved David.

437
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:51,568
So, never talk to me
about Charlie again, am I clear?

438
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:05,734
Please go now, Paul.
