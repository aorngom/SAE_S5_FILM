It's quinoa, Joan.

Yeah I seems that the inside of a plush, 
 but they are full of protein.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,120
Trevor, what are you doing here?

8
00:00:21,153 --> 00:00:23,588
What happens to your romantic evening with 
Kevin before they go to Africa?

9
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,693
- Put in an aircraft n in three hours. 
 - Who is Kevin?

10
00:00:25,727 --> 00:00:27,929
Kevin Kevin. You know what, Kevin?

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,230
Is Kevin humanitarian? Is Kevin the 
 back of the statue of David?

12
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,932
Look, the event is in the museum 
 with eight blocks from here,

13
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,468
where you shoud be. 
 Then you get in a car!

14
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:35,938
Iran and the airport. 
 Only 20 minutes as we have it.

15
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:37,139
20 minutes for what?

16
00:00:37,773 --> 00:00:39,508
I mean, How do you even --

17
00:00:41,143 --> 00:00:44,278
- You gotta be kidding me. 
 - Are you crazy within an hour?

18
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:47,415
- I'm against clock here. 
 - I Take Riley to a single session n.

19
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:49,183
I even assured me that no

Believes that the rule of "no match 
 my friends" was obvious.

21
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,420
I can not do.

22
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:54,689
- Sons ¡cala, Trevor. 
 - Want to go to Africa with Ã I l.

23
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,091
 Want to go with Ã I l?

24
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:00,194
Mira, Riley, sÃ I burned before you,

25
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:02,864
but I tell you, 
 this is Autentic.

26
00:01:06,198 --> 00:01:06,832
Agreed.

27
00:01:12,104 --> 00:01:14,539
Okay, perhaps 
 deep breathing

28
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,941
and think about it 
 for a minute.

29
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,844
Are you sure you want to 
 to flee to Africa with some guy?

30
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,613
Well, it is only a week, 
 and is not "some guy.

31
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,149
Is a worker for international support.

32
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:23,619
I am not surprised that gay 
 was knighted.

33
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,620
Trevor me him at Tres Equis, 
 and then we get on fine.

34
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,955
- It's been a whirlwind three weeks. 
 -  Three weeks?

35
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:29,656
I Never heard mentioned.

36
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,790
Because every time we put 
 the love of my life

37
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,726
you sign that I am rebuilding wings

38
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,528
a relationship with codependiente n 
 a narcissistic father figure

39
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,497
or revealing problems of trust 
 deeply.

40
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:38,498
That sounds like you.

41
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,999
It's like trying to go to dinner 
 with the leader of your group weight.

42
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,669
Perhaps that is why not 
 have women friends.

43
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:45,306
Claire has women friends. 
 I'm one of them.

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,075
Although, sometimes, just what I need 
 to someone compassionate,

45
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,910
s more of what I need 
 expert advice.

46
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,212
Come with us. 
 I want you to meet him.

47
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,481
 Go!  Go! 
  Go!  Go!

48
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:17,870
You are here.

49
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:21,273
I am just worried that it 
 was a joke for you.

50
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:22,976
Anything but that.

51
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,982
God provides for my work.

52
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:33,652
What the hell --

53
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,255
Who are you?

I called from London.

59
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:49,470
I guess it is not the first 
 time that happens. See you later.

60
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,206
Reminde me again.

00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,752
How could you do? 
  It's completely irresponsible!

67
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:06,753
How do you see how terrible I am?

68
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,722
Could not feel worse 
 if I pass something.

69
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,725
- Well, I say prove that theory. 
 - No, I know this came as a shock.

70
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,294
The other people in the world 
 were not you  make mistakes.

71
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,130
And if you stop and think, 
 at least for a millisecond --

72
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,400
Yes I stopped to think this time, 
 which I never do.

73
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,603
Something felt a little ... loose.

74
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,606
-  lazy? 
 - Yeah. You know, it was so good on paper.

75
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,877
Still, do you know what? No, lesson learned, 
 due to your instincts.

76
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:33,612
That is not the lesson. 
 The lesson is to stop interfering.

77
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,849
 Can I too get a room allready 
  Good!

78
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,352
Fighting is another sign of the atracion, 
  You know?

She speaks about it in his book.

80
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,656
Well, actually, that's 
 a simplificacion. What I said --

81
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,759
Claire, I have just been slapped 
 romantic.

82
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:49,862
And now there are photos me 
 kissing a married man.

83
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,431
There-out in the world.

84
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,437
The Holy Kevin ...

85
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,872
You offered me quadruple 
 for pictures and I rejected.

86
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:04,608
We were hoping to explain the situation. 
 You know, maybe you can help us out.

87
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,047
Yes, I am not really what we 
 call an helper.

88
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:10,048
My friend is an innocent witness. 
 She didn't know she was married to Kevin.

89
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:13,317
I I guess, but perhaps she should 
 take less hand holding out of him 

90
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:14,822
and more to find the ring on his finger.

91
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:16,058
The guy is a prosecutor 
 tanning line.

92
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:17,859
 When did you see as holding hands?

93
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:19,327
Well, his wife hired me 
 two weeks ago.

94
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:21,530
But I must tell you, 
 unbraided no money until last night.

95
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:23,931
 You know I have no idea 
 that he was married

96
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,899
and simply looked at me 
 being roled in?

97
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,902
- You can have warned. 
 - What you think it was last night?

98
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,138

00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:35,309
What are we friends?

101
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:37,613
It's not really the nature of 
 my job to protect the lover.

102
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:38,614
"Only doing my job."

103
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:40,849
 Is that what you say when trying 
 to sleep at night?

104
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:43,451
No, use them to sleep 
 tools used by any other IP uses

105
00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:45,620
Bourbon and telephone sex. 
 Now that you mention it ...

106
00:04:45,654 --> 00:04:48,922
"I was only doing my job." 
 Is the last I hear 

107
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:50,758
- before I falling asleep .... 
 - That is repulsive.

108
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:52,228
 Really? Great. 
  Does it mean you leaving?

109
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:54,929
God, Do you got a beating all 
 those days in high school?

110

167
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,152
doomed to failure.

168
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:33,921
Have a good day-a.

169
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:35,824
Wait.

170
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:39,626
 Does that mean that you object 
 to do a favor for a girl?

171
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,175
I am sorry that we felt that podÃas 
 talk to me about Kevin.

172
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:45,222
The sad thing is that there was no 
 imported if HACA.

173
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:47,303
The only difference YOU will have 
 º you been saying "I told you."

174
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:50,483
- Thanks for staying for dinner. 
 - I do not mean "I told you."

175
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:52,471
Only what I want to be a friend

176
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:55,024
normal and a friend 
 no expert on relationships

177
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:57,180
things you can do 
 normal friend to you.

178
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,240
We speak out together out 
 of the center, and never did.

179
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,814
Yes, I never took 
 the dance,  ¿verdad?

180
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:05,655
Or train for the half Marat ³ n, 
 which we can still do.

181
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:08,097
What say? Is the morning 
 morning, 6:00 A.M.?

182
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:09,685
We can start from your home.

183
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:12,438
Okay, but we 
 pact not to speak of men.

184
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:14,459
Done. 
 H-h-e-c-o.

185
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:17,878
This is the polish. 
 This is Russian.

186
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:21,747
Good. Try the Russian.

187
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:24,371
-  Trying drunk? 
 - Vamos. A small sip.

188
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:26,102
What am I doing too n, 
 and I'm working.

189
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:32,836
It is the same as I try.

190
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,248
Okay.

191
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,183
You can see the difference

192
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:38,385
between a first and a Vodka cheap.

193
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,320
I apologize for doubting you.

194
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,557
 So what brings you to 
 my fine establishment?

195
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,191
I will find my son here.

196
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:48,662
Are you seeing someone new, 
 and want the know.

197
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,264
No way you can 
 have a child of age.

198
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,603
MÃ º you same-thin.

199
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:05,339
It's my sister.

200
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:10,037
- Celia,  can you watch John atra ¡s 
 - Okay.

201
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,054
TÃ º. I hope you have a 
 truck parked ahead

202
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:17,814
full of cans of food 
 and toys to donate.

203
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,440
Okay, look 
 surprised me.

204
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:23,596
Your friend Trevor told me 
 that this last type

205
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:25,521
was not the first time that 
 you were hurt by a man.

206
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:27,480
He said he wanted some data 
 to walk away from the bad apples.

207
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:29,022
I never said anything well.

208
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:32,347
It makes no difference 
 for me. I I will.

209
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,473
Wait.

210
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,274
Ã ‰ l ³ never met her 
 telephone in front of you.

211
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:43,498
Yes, that does not mean to ³ 
 mi "degenerate womanizer."

212
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:45,081
That means "polite."

213
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:46,125
Nobody is so polite.

214
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,681
And always pay cash ³ 
 querÃa not because his wife

215
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:50,546
see anything suspicious in your account 
 card credit.

216
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:52,407
Often not received a step explanation ³ n

217
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:54,380
by step after that I s 
 stop the idiot I am.

218
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:57,199
I think the two can 
 Ã I l agree that it was the idiot.

219
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:02,240
So have you now trying to 
 make me feel better?

220
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,464
Hey, if it does not happen all the time,

221
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:05,166
-a will not work, right?

222
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,650
- Permit. 
 - What is this?

223
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,710
³ restaurant donates some tablecloths,

224
00:10:09,744 --> 00:10:11,958
but if you prefer the pla ... ¡stico

225
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:13,133
No.

226
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:17,679
Look, I appreciate your tutorial,

227
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,081
but my problem is not recognized 
 if a man you are married.

228
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:23,194
It is the first time I pass that error.

229
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:24,953
Only you find an honest man.

230
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:26,760
Yes, you mean the honest man.

231
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:32,236
Look, I think rules. 
 It's basic nature.

232
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:34,635
Men looking for 
 youth and beauty.

233
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:37,378
¡Na leave their wives for that, 
 abandon his entire family.

234
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,906
Perhaps you are more hard s 
 men like me.

235
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:42,294
No, no, no. I am a mass of ntropo ¡
 equal opportunities.

236
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,478
They refused ¡n, a 
 women overlook

237
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:46,446
anything for a 
 man healthy and strong.

238
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:49,904
Orit sign Hanes done that 
 for you in the recreation center.

239
00:10:49,904 --> 00:10:52,055
It's beautiful. 
 Thanks, Jessie.

240
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:57,123
 See? Algae day that sweet n º nia ± a 
 ¡break th
azÃ³n de un hoe heart of a man

241
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:57,974
by a wider and better.

242
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,414
Perhaps it is intelligent, and 
 avoid love altogether.

243
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:04,131
Apparently the donation ³ n de 
 food today incluÃa

244
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:06,994
the entire plate of cheeses 
 Blue Hill restaurant.

245
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:11,223
I will start to eat 
 s dining more often.

246
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:13,741
By Jessie.

247
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:17,161
Perhaps it is intelligent and 
 avoid love altogether.

248
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:19,207
Health.

249
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:25,543
&lt;i&gt; # Yes, I think I'm going 
 to get crazy for you #

250
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:27,292
God, I can not imagine married.

251
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:29,689
Bueno...

252
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,093
 Can you imagine paying pension ³ n 
 food once a month

253
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:34,426
a woman who lives with my ex captain n?

254
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:35,425
Former captain  ¿No?

255
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:37,792
 Were you a police-a?

256
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:39,124
Yes, sign ora.

257
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:42,168
So, your wife and the captain n,

258
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:45,262
I guess were not together 
 s until after the divorce.

259
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:47,078
 Does not that have been considered?

260
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:51,558
I need you &lt;i&gt; # #

261
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:54,964
&lt;i&gt; # I can not think of anyone more that s you #

262
00:11:56,386 --> 00:11:57,848
What happens to the drum bucket?

263
00:11:57,848 --> 00:11:58,786
Non-teaching by a bucket drum.

264
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,748
- Eso no es romántico.
- Él no es nuestro. Andaba por acá.

265
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:02,957
Well, the calo ¡sÃ here.

266
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:04,960
I Do not remove the shell a pound 
 oysters for my health.

267
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:07,903
Estoy creando un ambiente aquí.
Sacré bleu.

268
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,543
<i># Por ti, día y noche #</i>

269
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,179
<i># Fuera de mi mente #</i>

270
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:16,570
So well thought of waffles.

271
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:18,539
Parece que en serio conoces tu comida.

272
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,274
Lo recibí de mi papá.

273
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:22,537
-  Was cook? 
 - No, he liked to eat.

274
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:26,125
Police was also n-a.

275
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:28,716
And his father was police also n-a.

276
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,335
And his father ...

277
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:33,314
Barks was ³ n, but an 
 excellent cook.

278
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,224
I believe that algae Point No. n 
 was personal chef

279
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,308
the guard of imprisonment n 
 of Rikers Island, a reality.

280
00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:43,755
Must-stop as you cook something.

281
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,024
 Trying to fix it by leaving 
 I break the heart of?

282
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:49,922
You do not have the heart of broken.

283
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:52,285
Not loved. I noticed,

284
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:54,003
and not even needed 
 magnifying glass

285
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,091
but the truth helps.

286
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:57,230
I liked it.

287
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,176
Creator's intentions to 
 were honorable.

288
00:13:05,188 --> 00:13:08,517
This is the third time that 
 Limousine in the city with us.

289
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:10,767
Algae º  ¿n angry husband?

290
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,523
Are always a possibility.

291
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,153
This is my home.

292
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,731
Yeah, sÃ I it.

293
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:19,984
Clear.

294
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:25,910
Is Riley?

295
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:35,094
And now I have to kill Trevor.

296
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:37,109
I can not remember the last time

297
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,125
I was awake all 
 night because querÃa do.

298
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,879
I will prepare dinner tonight.

299
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:46,228
Forward. Must not-a 
 get involved with someone,

300
00:13:46,262 --> 00:13:48,796
especially a guy who yesterday

301
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,199
I refer to as "algae pond" 
 and no compassion tena ³ n.

302
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,821
Only I am a compassionate friend 
 and I'm happy you're happy.

303
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,296
Oops, you're good.

304
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:04,670
We have to talk a little.

305
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,652
Why not say "I have to gritarte, 
 so do not increase my expectations?</di
sl value="es">v><div id=clir>

306
00:14:07,657 --> 00:14:09,842
I can not believe you try to 
 find a partner Riley again.

307
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:13,327
Do not you realize how bad it 
 ended the last time?

308
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:16,140
That's why I'm putting my game 
 "A" here. I am compensating.

309
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,211
He has not said much about this,

310
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:18,621
but I've taken some things.

311
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:20,222
She has some serious 
 trouble trust.

312
00:14:20,222 --> 00:14:21,445
I thought that as approval.

313
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:23,527
Look, two people 
 do not believe in love,

314
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:25,246
is something we have in common n,

315
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:27,248
an indicator of relationship, if you want.

316
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:29,474
And I think his encounter 
 initial combative

317
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:31,815
a subliminal sabotage that 
 indicates a latent atracciÃ ³ n.

318
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:33,617
 Have you been reading my book?

319
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:37,245
- I am in the four-ter layer. It's good. 
 - Well, read on.

320
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:39,381
And you can see that s ¡
 initial aggressive encounters

321
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:41,149
usually require 
 ¡catharsis trauma characteristics,

322
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:44,486
a jump of a cliff, and most 
 of the relationships do not survive.

323
00:14:45,174 --> 00:14:47,541
Great. Jumps of a cliff.

324
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,121
That is the subyoutulo of 
 my book, "Yeah I bold.

325
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,231
Please tell me 
 remember what I drink.

326
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:57,449
I could never say, 
 "I shall take the usual."

327
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:59,709
I never forget a face or a drink.

328
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:04,050
Yesterday was a bit strange,  ¿no?

329
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:06,588
Yeah, sÃ. Small world, huh?

330
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:09,189
I have been considering the situation n.

331
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:12,080
Six months have passed since my divorce,

332
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:15,417
and I have known none 
's enjoy your company

333
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:17,319
much like yours yesterday.

334
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,311
Was switched on yesterday picamente attacks.

335
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:22,323
Normally I'ma ina helpful.

336
00:15:23,926 --> 00:15:26,327
I think we must leave-masters. 
 We're adults.

337
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:29,831
Cory and Lita are almost adults.

338
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:31,266
 ¡l ¿Cua is the harm or?

339
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:37,906
God-or more.

340
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,742
So, is like heaven smells of meat.

341
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:42,711
Is So that's how you get 
 pujen your appointments for you?

342
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:45,581
Actually, no, 
 never cook for my appointments.

343
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:48,783
Honestly, 
 since my wife left me ³

344
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:52,520
I have just been me and a number 
 of hookers with privileges,

345
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:54,656
and food for china 
 usually solves the problem.

346
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,025
Had you been satisfied with 
 whore with privileges,

347
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:59,593
you have not created a screen saver 
 with Riley's face on it.

348
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:01,130
Well, I was a police-eight years,

349
00:16:01,665 --> 00:16:03,900
then a I.P. for the past six.

350
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:06,535
Not many people know pure

351
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:09,372
very good, 
 really good people.

352
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:12,641
And last night was so perfect.

353
00:16:12,675 --> 00:16:14,610
You know, I ...

354
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:17,046
It is rare how to ³ everything went well.

355
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,081
As if the gods were 
 I ndote smiled.

356
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:23,419
Yes. Well, just so afraid that after s 
 the magic of last night

357
00:16:23,453 --> 00:16:27,721
º you know, things calm down 
 and regain her sanity.

358
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:33,061
Hi, this is Nick.

359
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:34,062
&lt;i&gt; Hello, Riley.

360
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:38,666
No, I understand. 
 T say more s.

361
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:41,235
- Things arise. 
 - What? Wait. No. What you doing? Give me that.

362
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,439
Riley, What happened?

363
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,440
Trevor, dÃ I pull off the event 
 with dignity, right?

364
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:45,575
Well, listen, we are on track.

365
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,776
Back.

366
00:16:48,811 --> 00:16:50,678
He says his name is Ted Smith.

367
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:52,447
She lives with her daughter's family,

368
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:53,816
but can not remember 
 your married surname.

369
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:57,985
He suffers from dementia and likely forgot ³ 
 
casa."><input make your pÃldoras and left his house ³.

370
00:16:58,219 --> 00:17:00,121
Well, that is all I 
 Tena in your pocket.

371
00:17:00,156 --> 00:17:02,490
Receipt bus s, 
 some sweets for coughs and this.

372
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:04,759
It is a card of thanks 
 a "Bobby"

373
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:06,961
but no name or address n.

374
00:17:07,596 --> 00:17:09,432
Yes, should be able to carry 
 a house with this.

375
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,867
N Who are you, Nostradamus?

376
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:13,902
There is no n address or surname.

377
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:15,738
Do notice the snow reflects MuÃ ± 
 ³ dico holding periodic?

378
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:19,141
The dealer gave it. All you 
 have to do is call

379
00:17:19,175 --> 00:17:21,143
and find the path of Bobby.

380
00:17:21,777 --> 00:17:22,711
After  ¿s what?

381
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:25,680
Okay, gang, 
 hit the door

382
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:27,582
to find someone 
 who knows.

383
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:30,785
This is not the sexy part 
 of detective work.

384
00:17:33,688 --> 00:17:35,790
Is that So I guess the irrupciÃ ³ n 
 in this search

385
00:17:35,724 --> 00:17:38,092
was your idea to Nick 
 Riley impress?

386
00:17:38,127 --> 00:17:39,928
There was no irrupciÃ ³ n. 
 Ã ‰ l runs.

387
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:41,530
And his idea, incidentally.

388
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:43,699
Very well, you know what? 
 Probably should be divided.

389
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:45,235
S can cover more 
 ground that way.

390
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:46,704
You can not be stopped 
 your own air.

391
00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:48,673
Iran s door to door looking Ndolo ¡
 a bride Ted,

392
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,275
instead of finding 
 home.

393
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:54,311
 Do you think Ted is a bachelor?

394
00:17:56,545 --> 00:18:00,281
So even a I.P. you can use 
 your skills for something good.

395
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:02,250
Yes, true.

396
00:18:02,284 --> 00:18:03,620
I'll pay my rent with karma points.

397
00:18:05,654 --> 00:18:08,457
Gives an impression of malÃsima 
 ¡ntropo a mass, detective.

398
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:12,660
Hello. Do hope that you may 
 know this man?

399
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:16,096
Yes, I think it is the pope of ¡
 the sign either living next door.

400
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,000

Thank God.

402
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:24,138
 ¡Grandpa!  ¡Grandpa!

403
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:26,540
Here  ¡n-are my kids!

404
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:30,780
&lt;i&gt;  ¿DÃ ³ nde you? 
 I was so worried about you.

405
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:46,026
&lt;i&gt; meat and salad probably 
 are in the last.

406
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,296
I But I think we can save the dessert.

407
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,599
Sorry I ruined your dinner. Hope 
 you do not take many annoyances.

408
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:53,069
No hassle. 
 Why do not you sit down?

409
00:18:53,204 --> 00:18:55,238
- Only you give me a second. 
 - Okay.

410
00:18:56,873 --> 00:18:59,708
&lt;i&gt; Oye,  ¿I can at least help 
 with anything?

411
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,045
So ...

412
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,682
 Is this your version n 
 "no hassle"?

413
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:09,284
No-tell that.

414
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:12,920
This is a bad idea.

415
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:14,690
The worst idea of all.

416
00:19:19,361 --> 00:19:21,062
Normally I am not well-de talkative.

417
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:23,465
Nor so-popular.

418
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:26,067
Die for attention n

419
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:27,936
or is that pepperoni 
 put in my pocket.

420
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:29,972
Good move. 
 I think they have guts.

421
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:33,542
I miss my instinct 
 on your knees

422
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:34,677
but I had no value.

423
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:42,250
Thank the gods for 
 the second time.

424
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:49,657
Dogs tena-an n. reason 
 It is very pleasant.

425
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:51,561
It is a very nice knees.

426
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:11,946
Why is that smile, Lord?

427
00:20:11,981 --> 00:20:12,814
- What, this? 
 - Yeah.

428
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:13,849
It is remorse.

429
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,985
Repentance. No reason Tena 
 Nothing good out of this pruning.

430
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,121
I swear.

431
00:20:22,057 --> 00:20:23,592
No sÃ I you, but ...

432
00:20:24,226 --> 00:20:25,727
I feel terrible.

433
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:26,962
I never felt worse.

434
00:20:32,868 --> 00:20:34,570
God. I'm so behind.

435
00:20:38,507 --> 00:20:40,742
Wish to stay, 
 but I have to go to school.

436
00:20:41,277 --> 00:20:44,345
Yes, well, I have to shoot

437
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,314
a deputy with 
 a prostitute, so that ...

438
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,319
I assume that this time 
 ¡ndome were monitored,

439
00:20:51,353 --> 00:20:53,555
Do you manage to get 
 number of my phone?

440
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:54,390
I did.

441
00:20:55,824 --> 00:20:57,426
So-Do you speak more I s late?

442
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,261
With it.

443
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:42,736
Hi, s are backward.

444
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:47,437
Dark circles, hair disheveled, 
 without shaving beards,

445
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:48,841
and if I am mistaken,

446
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:52,145
I think they call that guy 
 walking "show off".

447
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,180
Do not you dare sully the memory 
 of the meeting last night

448
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:58,384
with your childhood innuendo.

449
00:21:58,918 --> 00:21:59,852
Do I find?

450
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,822
You sound as if thou hadst 
 collected from an airport.

451
00:22:02,256 --> 00:22:03,690
By the way, just so you know what,

452
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:05,426
can be much more s 
 this child.

453
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,561
But ... Do you like it?

454
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,230
Yes, I like it.

455
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:13,366
Say high, say it proud. 
  I believe in Cupid!

456
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,101
- No-go so far. 
 - Okay.

457
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:16,871
Definitely, there was a connection n.

458
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:20,206
So ...

459
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,775
Cory's mother is away from ¡³ 
 to enter your home

460
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,844

 of the morning.

00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:27,580
- How do you know?

I was at home working on 
 RSVP for the birthday party,

Not that it's none of your business.

464
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,987
I can not believe you invited out 
 a mom! My boyfriend.

³ invited me to leave. 
 Not that it's none of your business.

00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,659
It's very matter-or more. 
 Cory are mad.

467

- Separated .... 
 - Six months have passed.

469
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,100
Yes, and now her mom come back home 
 with her hair all disheveled.

470
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,836
Cory needs to get 
 their own home.

471
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:54,172
³ moves back to his house because his 
 mama got sit alone in her apartment.

Lita, you walk down the street 
 and the boys fall at your feet.

477
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:12,701
Or upset me to learn 
 the name of your boyfriend because

478
00:23:12,702 --> 00:23:14,362
I can not afford.

479
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,297
This kid is special for me, Felix.

480
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,035

when we leave the house ...

488
00:23:41,238 --> 00:23:45,174
Okay. Riley is a nice girl.

489
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:48,549
- Fill the glass with whatever you have. 
 - You got it.

490
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,923

Not much. It is the kind of person 
 that you understand the rapid,  you know?

493
00:23:57,682 --> 00:23:59,513
Actually, no.

494
00:24:01,615 --> 00:24:04,176
I can not believe that a girl 
 how she is I herself.

495
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:05,436
Lo sÃ I.

496
00:24:05,437 --> 00:24:07,489

497
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,080
What is this? 
 Remorse or afternoon.

498

Yes, it can be.

502
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,549
But Riley Hanes has existed only 
 from the past three years.

503
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:22,052
I Find a little.

504
00:24:22,486 --> 00:24:25,921
Seems to have come full 
 the world formed in 2006.

505
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,323
No traces of it before that.

506
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,592
Then there is a clerical error,

507
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:33,028
building or public records 
 their city burning ³.

508
00:24:33,162 --> 00:24:34,997
And it has something for married men.

509
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:36,899
S Are you crazy.

510
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:38,700
Grayson Davis.

511
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:40,102
It's owner or the middle of Boston.

512
00:24:40,236 --> 00:24:42,538
Riley picked ³, 
 spent a couple hours

513
00:24:42,572 --> 00:24:44,874
in the Soho Grand before proceeding 
 back to their home.

514
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:46,276
Explains how to a social worker

515
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,478
can afford an apartment 
 big 5 a month, right?

516
00:24:48,713 --> 00:24:51,115
That's why he was so desperate 
 by retrieving the photos.

517
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:55,185
In my line of work, 
 I see such things every day.

518
00:24:55,157 --> 00:24:57,153
Well, it sounds like one of 
 these medical students

519
00:24:57,188 --> 00:24:58,502
convince themselves that 
 they have leprosy.

520
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:02,473
Perhaps you have reason No, Trevor,

521
00:25:02,473 --> 00:25:05,095
or perhaps the morning hours, 
 I will have the money.

522
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:08,505
See you.

523
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,715
A donation will have for you:

524
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:18,533
olives, cherries to marraschino, 
 a bit of Bloody Mary.

525
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:22,477
Thank you. That's sweet. You never know 
 when a homeless person

526
00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:23,904
want to party.

527
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:26,248
Hey, have you saw me yesterday?

528
00:25:26,248 --> 00:25:28,894
- I saw you outside the Soho Grand. 
 - ³ He had to be someone else.

529
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,080
Not in the Soho Grand.

530
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,655
Sure, you were dating 
 hotel with such

531
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,728
How is it called? The rate of 
 a lot of silver, Grayson Davis.

532
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:37,325
I am a fool.

533
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:39,497
When you say "Grayson" I remembered I.

534
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,007
Abama is suponÃa us 
 find on the Peninsula,

535
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:43,420
but then changed ³. 
 We are a donation will

536
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,620
which gives the center.

537
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:46,779
Well, I'm sure you 
 convinced to donate much.

538
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:47,806
Yes.

539
00:25:53,776 --> 00:25:55,256
I was so sure that tena-a reason n.

540
00:25:55,508 --> 00:25:58,523
Not a moment of pause. 
 Suddenly inspiration n.

541
00:25:59,813 --> 00:26:01,216
You know, like a 
 bombita light of love

542
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,228
³ goes off in my head, you know?

543
00:26:02,704 --> 00:26:04,925
Nick and Riley should be together.

544
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:06,381
Now everything is a disaster.

545
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:08,611
Well, maybe this will show you 
 what is currently

546
00:26:08,611 --> 00:26:12,618
- To make sure that call Cupid. 
 - But I'm Cupid.

547
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:14,966
That's why it's so frustrating.

548
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:17,690
You know, you can not teach 
 this- ¿sÃ? There is no manual.

549
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,700
Everything depends on me, my instinct.

550
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:22,118
Maybe they will.

551
00:26:23,262 --> 00:26:25,195
Too many years of it for granted.

552
00:26:25,195 --> 00:26:26,620
Perhaps reason tena-an n.

553
00:26:27,187 --> 00:26:28,121
Who tions?

554
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:32,971
The people you cast 
 Mount Olympus.

555
00:26:33,848 --> 00:26:35,420
Perhaps lose my gift.

556
00:26:49,465 --> 00:26:50,490
Sorry to be late.

557
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:54,455
Is  ¡s better mood than yesterday? 
  ¿MÃ ¡s reasonable?

558
00:26:54,455 --> 00:26:56,882
I am very humorous, 
 could not be better.

559
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,513
Is Fresh flowers for you?

560
00:26:58,513 --> 00:26:59,110
Thank you.

561
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:01,929
So ... man 
 s that are watching ...

562
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:04,851
It ended. No more s.

563
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:07,574
&lt;i&gt; - Do not tolerate I. 
 - Yeah.

564
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:10,070
That &lt;i&gt; ... not going to happen.

565
00:27:10,826 --> 00:27:12,796
They are underestimating &lt;i&gt; s 
 seriously what I speak.

566
00:27:13,469 --> 00:27:15,038
&lt;i&gt; Are you doing a little s 
 that same you.

567
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,639
I think I love him, Dad!.

568
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:21,664
 ¡Hey, Dad?  ¡Yeah, I baby!

569
00:27:22,337 --> 00:27:25,161
Priscilla Davis, not what you see.

570
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:28,040
- Do not discuss it again. 
 -  ¿ "Priscilla"?

571
00:27:34,744 --> 00:27:36,810
S Are you with a unique humor, Nick.

572
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,989
Yes, I am not sure if I care.

573
00:27:40,054 --> 00:27:43,135
I like my lovers investigators 
 private my eggs:

574
00:27:43,135 --> 00:27:44,476
well tough.

575
00:27:45,157 --> 00:27:46,812
Although ...

576
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:48,426
I wanted to a fried.

577
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,497
China food arrived.

578
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:53,997
You have nothing upstairs.

579
00:27:54,163 --> 00:27:55,396
TÃ º do not have pants.

580
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,217
 Nick?

581
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,750
These are from yesterday.

582
00:28:14,163 --> 00:28:16,132
 What are s spying again?

583
00:28:16,705 --> 00:28:19,878
It's like I am. Does not confirm or anybody.

584
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,567
Tena the impression that 
 sabÃas feels like that.

585
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:25,363
Yes. I ...

586
00:28:26,493 --> 00:28:29,039
suponÃa that eventually could 
 espionage overcome.

587
00:28:31,268 --> 00:28:32,419
That's what happens,

588
00:28:35,388 --> 00:28:37,939
I Boston left my name and change I

589
00:28:38,537 --> 00:28:40,308
because we can not differentiate

590
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,551
between the man who loved me

591
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:44,857
and the man who querÃa 
 inherit my family fortune.

592
00:28:47,627 --> 00:28:49,991
So, now you know 
 the truth about me,

593
00:28:51,752 --> 00:28:54,114
I'm sure mean ¡s 
 why ever more I s may trust you.

594
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,047
Riley.

595
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,325
Should you drink in the morning,

596
00:29:05,325 --> 00:29:07,132
perhaps want to get something.

597
00:29:07,337 --> 00:29:09,778
And took two coffee s I 
 Irish, but thanks.

598
00:29:09,823 --> 00:29:11,150
Tena reason n-as with Riley.

599
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:16,352
Le pregunté por Grayson,
el personaje millonario, y me mintió.

600
00:29:17,153 --> 00:29:18,943
Yeah I te I did go into this,

601
00:29:18,943 --> 00:29:21,301
I sia-well that ntete free tirarme something.

602
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,219
The ball Ba I isbol of Thurman Munson.

603
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,684
But not in the face.

604
00:29:25,354 --> 00:29:27,255
 No? My mage is ³ are being closed

605
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,041
- As the home of "Poltergeist." 
 - It's called guilt.

606
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:31,985
What, as is well-known? 
 Es horrible.

607
00:29:31,985 --> 00:29:32,956
Yeah-day-melo.

608
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:37,935
Riley not lied ³.

609
00:29:38,498 --> 00:29:39,254
Do not do that?

610
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:41,251
That silver fox. The men 
 wealthy was not his lover.

611
00:29:41,251 --> 00:29:43,116
The man was his father.

612
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,681
So that was not wrong.

613
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:49,305
My instinct was not wrong.

614
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:54,104
 In your face court 
 disciplinary Mount Olympus!

615
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:56,250
The worst part is that I think 
 that loss forever.

616
00:29:56,263 --> 00:30:00,659
 In your face, Dr. Claire "perhaps need to 
 stop believing in yourself" McCrae!

617
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:04,097
I am glad that you do not see the 
 party "lost forever"

618
00:30:04,097 --> 00:30:07,162
- ... So depressing as I do. 
 - Wait. What?

619
00:30:09,131 --> 00:30:10,425
Nick Kazarian, private investigator,

620
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,141
What did you do?

621
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,661
 What s more crazy? Yeah I my dad ¡
 sounds like the villain

622
00:30:14,661 --> 00:30:16,394
in this, and maybe it is.

623
00:30:16,465 --> 00:30:19,071
But it has reason to worry n 
 for his fortune.

624
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,034
One of his biggest fears, he says,

625
00:30:21,334 --> 00:30:22,928
is going to take me 
 check inheritance

626
00:30:22,928 --> 00:30:24,851
and putting it in the can a tramp.

627
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,062
"Tramp," his word.

628
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:28,673
In fact, the 
 sound of the check to you.

629
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,572
His other fear is that my case 
 wrong with someone.

630
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:35,899
When tena-25 years,

631
00:30:36,507 --> 00:30:39,151
my father told me that Roga ³ 
 go with Brent Chase

632
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:41,085
the young vice president of his company.

633
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,451
I Over time we agree to submit,

634
00:30:43,293 --> 00:30:46,261
and, big surprise, 
 we get along.

635
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:48,261
It was my kind of man:

636
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:51,347
A mentor in a bunch 
 of kids in the city.

637
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:53,138
Gave literacy classes for adults.

638
00:30:53,346 --> 00:30:56,261
I requested that I marry ³ Ã I l 
 in the race against breast CÃ ¡ncer.

639
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:58,545
Something bad will happen,  ¿verdad?

640
00:30:59,512 --> 00:31:02,797
Before the wedding, he discovered that my father

641
00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:05,033
¡ba-a physically bean invented to Brent.

642
00:31:05,858 --> 00:31:06,932
He was trained ³.

643
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:10,987
I turned up in every way 
 our relationship n.

644
00:31:12,868 --> 00:31:15,385
He was about to marry a man 
 who was a complete work of FICCI ³ n.

645
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:20,316
It's an amazing story.

646
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,749
Rich people.

647
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:24,564
Loco,  ¿verdad?

648
00:31:26,373 --> 00:31:29,138
Aha, was changed when I 
 my name legally.

649
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:33,150
And here I am certain moves I 
 live my terms.

650
00:31:33,749 --> 00:31:36,789
Only the thought that I had seen-something Nick,

651
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:40,350
some softness in the 
 front of everything sÃ I. I ...

652
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:42,691
Speak, please. I give you permission.

653
00:31:42,725 --> 00:31:44,843
And "I told you" is very 
 well deserved in this case.

654
00:31:45,461 --> 00:31:48,463
All I want to say 
 is that the sweetness in Nick ...

655
00:31:49,762 --> 00:31:51,266
n I also saw it.

656
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,518
Mr. Kazarian.

657
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:00,017

Well, go is welcome.

676
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:49,563
was a promising sign.

677
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:51,527
Good to know that we are 
 on the same page on anything.

678
00:32:51,777 --> 00:32:52,602
Good to know.

679
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,043
I think the problems because of Cory 
 I leave with her mother gone.

680
00:32:56,078 --> 00:32:58,889
- Come to the party. 
 - No, actually follow.

681
00:32:59,632 --> 00:33:02,113
Only he knows how important 
 this is for me.

682
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:09,471
Dad!.

683
00:33:10,486 --> 00:33:11,554
What-do here?

684
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:13,402
Why not get in the car?

685
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,493
I think there is anything-as must see.

686
00:33:19,395 --> 00:33:22,190
Sorry for the bad Ã ¡ngulo of the camera.

687
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,049
Jeffrey found a ³ 
 wonderful portfolio

688
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:25,879
that obscures a small video camera.

689
00:33:26,342 --> 00:33:28,602
&lt;i&gt; It's very simple, Mr. Kazarian.

690
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:30,066
Signing this contract &lt;i&gt;

691
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:32,439
&lt;i&gt; agreeing to be away from my daughter,

692
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:35,032
&lt;i&gt; and receives a check for $ 100,000.

693
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,606
&lt;i&gt; Demons Are you serious?

694
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,553
I am not known &lt;i&gt; 
 my jokes, Mr. Kazarian.

695
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:41,541
 ¿&lt;i&gt; 100 grand?

696
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:42,931
&lt;i&gt; Well

697
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:45,869
&lt;i&gt;  ¿dÃ ³ nde sign?

698
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:48,052
I think you have the idea.

699
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:55,045
Riley, tries to calm down a little,- ¿sÃ?

700
00:33:56,131 --> 00:33:57,428
 ¡s Is this safe?

701
00:33:57,816 --> 00:34:00,655
A lawyer for my dad recorded it ¡³. I saw everything.

702
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:03,876
Nick was unable to sign the contract 
 s most rapid.

703
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:06,468
I ...

704
00:34:08,021 --> 00:34:09,393
I can not believe 
 be so surprised.

705
00:34:09,393 --> 00:34:11,036
Why the hell thought that 
 will be different this time?

706
00:34:11,538 --> 00:34:14,416
Because I told you that Nick was different.

707
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:18,677
 ¿DÃ ³ nde s are? I'm going to find.

708
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:19,515
Parked in front of the Soho Grand,

709
00:34:19,549 --> 00:34:21,894
waiting for my dad ¡
 bring your luggage.

710
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,010
&lt;i&gt; I will return to Boston, 
 at least for a while.

711
00:34:38,581 --> 00:34:39,435
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

712
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:43,221
You look good.

713
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:44,630
Thank you. It was a nice surprise.

714
00:34:46,942 --> 00:34:47,985
 ¿Ã-bamos We find here-?

715
00:34:48,451 --> 00:34:50,352
I thought that we are 
 met then down.

716
00:34:50,552 --> 00:34:52,112
In fact, I am here.

717
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,184
I've been thinking about it.

718
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:59,334
What if we find after s 
 of the party, after that s you

719
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:01,413

 family

720
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:02,937
I s and is with a little alcohol?

721
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:06,826
I was waiting there.

722
00:35:06,826 --> 00:35:08,699
The 40th anniversary celebration 
 parent

723
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:11,418
perhaps a little too intense for me.

724
00:35:11,668 --> 00:35:14,684
I do not feel ready for that.

725
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:17,773
 So I guess that will come I 
 s here after the party

726
00:35:17,808 --> 00:35:20,015
for some quality time alone?

727
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:22,949
&lt;i&gt; Always and forever # #

728
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,264
Each time you &lt;i&gt; # #

&lt;i&gt; # It's like a dream for me-#

That algae &lt;i&gt; º # n # so it became a reality

&lt;i&gt; 'Cause I got you in my life #

734
00:35:49,253 --> 00:35:51,261
 Do you know what your friend did Nick?

735
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:53,593
³ ruined it, but it will solve.

736
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,595
Are you trying to crawl now.

737
00:35:55,595 --> 00:35:56,431
I'm surprised have not 
 heard nothing Ã I l.

738
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:57,670
Is trying to fix it, how to?

739
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,575
What is going to do, send 
 flowers and a note?

740
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,742
"I have broken your heart,

741
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:05,230
- But 100 is big money. "
 - Look, I do not understand

742
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,117
nothing s are saying now.

743
00:36:07,297 --> 00:36:10,873
The spy ³. ³ mistook his 
 father with his mistress

744
00:36:10,873 --> 00:36:12,468
it could happen to anyone. 
 What is this about money?

745
00:36:12,468 --> 00:36:15,697
Riley's father offered him a ³ 
 $ 100,000 to Nick away

746
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:17,829
his daughter. ³ Nick nor I thought twice.

747
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:19,836
³ Signing the contract, Riley saw the video.

748
00:36:19,836 --> 00:36:23,300
-  You understand now?  Do you see the image? 
 - How can I do?

749
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,641
Going to ask.

750
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:29,273
I can not find 
 a Riley in n º ning side.

751
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:31,047
They are not at home, 
 they are not at work.

752
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,477
Why you find it?

753
00:36:32,949 --> 00:36:35,383
- Do remember not to see it? 
 - Lost  ³ n?

754
00:36:35,618 --> 00:36:37,517
Are you on video, Nick. Do not deny it.

755
00:36:37,554 --> 00:36:38,687
 What they recorded the video?

756
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:46,128
# &lt;i&gt; I remember, head down #

757
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:50,409
# Before you &lt;i&gt; mind that 
 it's a damn manna drug #

00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,251
&lt;i&gt; Yeah.

&lt;i&gt; Certainly.

-  ¿º n Alga message Riley 
 - It has a lot to resolve.

771
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:54,783
Yes, could have erased the

00:37:54,783 --> 00:37:57,179
- Which I refuse to sign. 
 - Time for the speech.

773
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:59,166
Do you mind sharing 
 some champaÃ ± a?

774
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:01,237
No, it's my job. 
 Oye,  ¿dÃ ³ nde are Mira?

Not attend.

776

Things did not work between us.

777
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:06,422
Dude, where's my bread s are pulling.

778
00:38:06,422 --> 00:38:08,439
Bamos are not on the same page,  you know?

779
00:38:10,673 --> 00:38:11,644
Not so.

780
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:19,786
Man, I receive many cra-tics.

781
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,689
A couple of days, one of my 
 ³ employees asked me why,

782
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:26,568
watching the parade of women 
 attractive to come here

783
00:38:27,106 --> 00:38:29,528
and example is so positive in my life:

784
00:38:29,528 --> 00:38:32,315
My parents, married 40 years ago today.

785
00:38:33,837 --> 00:38:37,796
Why I still single?

786
00:38:37,796 --> 00:38:40,954
&lt;i&gt; -  Because you do not like women! 
 - Yeah, gracias.

787
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:43,806
Thanks for ... support.

788
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:45,752
The fact is that ...

789
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:50,429
precisely because his example 
 n I still own.

790
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:53,002
I've been around much 
 of their 40 years together

791
00:38:53,421 --> 00:38:56,038
I just-so that is how to true love.

792
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,829
And each time mido 
 one of my relationships

793
00:38:59,863 --> 00:39:02,356
to their level, who knows what else.

794
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:04,255
Y sÃ I I'm going to keep looking.

795
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,268
I will keep looking, because 
 I want what they have.

796
00:39:08,315 --> 00:39:09,598
And I want that Lita is also n.

797
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:15,878
So &lt;i&gt; Is that how to own

798
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:18,781
one of the adult movie 
 More New York s finest

799
00:39:19,215 --> 00:39:21,951
convince a teacher of Garden 
 infants to spend the rest of

00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,299

801
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:26,686
Well, Ã I l ³ got a full,

72 hours, do you, Dad!?

804
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:33,694
So everything is like the 
 dating Gus and hard Bibi ³.

805
00:39:33,694 --> 00:39:35,480
When my dad took a decision ¡n,

806
00:39:37,147 --> 00:39:37,886
are taken.

807
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:40,558
Thank God for that, Dad!.

808
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,773
So that if they do not care 
 join me in a toast

809
00:39:43,807 --> 00:39:44,935
by my parents,

Dad!.

813
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:55,136
Thanks for putting the bar very high.

I love you. Health.

00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:00,716
 &lt;i&gt; Nick?

817
00:40:11,985 --> 00:40:13,718
That was a kiss, "Romeo B."

818
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:15,689
How will you overcome that?

819
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:17,806
CÃ ¡sate me.

820
00:40:21,238 --> 00:40:22,388
Sorry. What?

821
00:40:22,423 --> 00:40:23,445
I House monkeys.

822
00:40:25,804 --> 00:40:28,522
Must-as ... probably must know-as

823
00:40:28,522 --> 00:40:31,609
when I told my dad ¡
 re the car to make Ã I l. ..

824
00:40:32,046 --> 00:40:33,702
told me to let 
 to recognize as a daughter.

825
00:40:34,114 --> 00:40:36,336
You'll marry a poor 
 social worker.

826
00:40:36,721 --> 00:40:37,650
 So what is a just-?

827
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,979
I guess this means 
 that you feel validated.

828
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:50,308
 Are you going to re-arm 
 Thinking your instinct?

829
00:40:50,308 --> 00:40:51,423
 ¿s No more questions?

830
00:40:51,423 --> 00:40:54,346
Not sure. Things do not 
 exactly worked for Felix.

831
00:40:54,346 --> 00:40:56,572
I think I'm going to go with the theory 
 the "pull a few things

832
00:40:56,572 --> 00:40:58,433
against a wall and see if it sticks. "

833
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:02,859

 the first time, random arrows?

Hey, I did this couple. 
 I'm not going to share the credit.
