1
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:16,657
We need sanctuary.

2
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:18,503
Oh, my God.
What have you done?

3
00:00:18,628 --> 00:00:20,727
I staked a vampire,
the lover of Russell Edgington.

4
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:23,187
- Are you insane?
- Where can we go?

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,691
A human home would be safest.
We've both been invited into Sookie's.

6
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:29,694
That's out of the question.

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,855
You never panic.
Should I be panicking?

8
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:34,991
Ginger, dear, where do you live?

9
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:37,300
Across the river in Bossier. Why?

10
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:39,245
We need your house. Now-ish.

11
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:40,955
Because of the V-Feds?

12
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:02,469
I'm sorry, Miss Flanagan.
The bar is closed.

13
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,534
Thank you. I already ate.

14
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:06,310
Tru Blood only, of course.

15
00:01:07,044 --> 00:01:09,395
Can't stay out of trouble, can you?

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,114
The VRA is two states away
from ratification.

17
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,239
I should be kissing asses in Oregon,
not cleaning up after you

18
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,745
in fucking Louisiana.

19
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,167
I promise

20
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,771
- there is nothing amiss in my area.
- Shut up.

21
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,354
You're making my head hurt.

22
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:24,389
Officers...

23
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,417
silver him.

24
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:07,488
Where is he?

25
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:09,353
- Where is he?
- In the study, sire.

26
00:03:15,617 --> 00:03:16,554
Talbot.

27
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,872
My Love me.

28
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:33,356
Nice, is it?

29
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:05,451
I suppose
I should have mentioned that.

30
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:07,889
There's an old tarp out back.

31
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,293
Normal couples do not do this.

32
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,087
Thought you'd given up
on being like normal couples.

33
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,843
What would you rather be doing?

34
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,421
Sitting on the sofa,
watching television?

35
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,096
Used to be my idea
of excitement, you know.

36
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:50,963
You've spoiled me.

37
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:52,589
Just once,

38
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,040
I'd like to...

39
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:57,146
not find a dead body in my house.

40
00:05:57,415 --> 00:05:58,920
Is that asking too much?

41
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:02,568
He was sent to kill you.
If I didn't kill him,

42
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,353
he would have come back for you.

43
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,850
You have to trust me.

44
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:13,381
Don't you?

45
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:16,240
I do.

46
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:19,794
I try to,
but then there's things like...

47
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:22,171
Like?

48
00:06:23,126 --> 00:06:25,049
Like that secret file you got on me.

49
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:27,593
The one Russell Edgington showed me.

50
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:30,888
Birth records, family trees,
newspaper clippings

51
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,244
about me.

52
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:33,677
He said it's yours.

53
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:36,737
It's true.

54
00:06:37,132 --> 00:06:38,729
I collected information to find out

55
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,190
why Eric Northman
has interest in you.

56
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,485
I assume it has to do
with what you are.

57
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:47,196
- Do you know what I am?
- Truly, I do not.

58
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,194
I'm doing my best to find out.

59
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,618
I don't know
how you did things in the 1800s,

60
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,938
but keeping a file
on the woman you love

61
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:56,580
is creepy.

62
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,667
I have to know what you are,
or else I can't protect you.

63
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:01,585
But you have to trust me

64
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:05,214
and stop thinking of me
as a thing to be protected.

65
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:08,134
I took care of Debbie by myself.

66
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,747
I'm not afraid
to spill a little blood anymore.

67
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:13,193
Much as you want to be human,

68
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:15,891
I'm meeting you halfway to vampire.

69
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:28,156
What?

70
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,508
This is where I come up with an excuse
to get you the fuck up out of here.

71
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:36,010
Like, "I gotta get to work early".
Or, "I think I got food poisoning".

72
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:38,330
Or, "Would you help me
clean the lice out of my bed?"

73
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:41,375
- I go with ticks.
- And which is it this time?

74
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:44,503
I guess you can stay.

75
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:47,214
Good answer.

76
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,684
Really.

77
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,421
Very good answer.

78
00:07:58,582 --> 00:07:59,882
I like your ink.

79
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,233
They say the Olmecs and the Mayans
used to worship the jaguar.

80
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,342
He's strong and elusive.

81
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:12,582
He holds power

82
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:14,287
over the universe.

83
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:15,904
Yeah?

84
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:20,039
Is that what you think of yourself?

85
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:23,959
Okay, my high school
was the Jaguars.

86
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:26,561
That's more like it.

87
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:28,964
But it's pretty anyhow.

88
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,964
I told you, he's not here!

89
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:46,476
Where the fuck is he?

90
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:48,818
- Why ain't he got you chained up?
- I don't know!

91
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,152
Stop it! I can't think!

92
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,489
Just freeze!
Hands on your head.

93
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:56,075
- You a cop? Is he?
- Don't answer.

94
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:57,957
- Not really.
- What are you asking?

95
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,036
Ransom? We ain't got much.

96
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:01,622
- Ransom?
- He wants money!

97
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:03,624
No!
What are you talking about?

98
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,501
I won't leave you.
You're mine

99
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,752
since you was 4.

100
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,170
{\She's her own woman,
she can do what she wants.}
She's not an object.

101
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,127
You're the one who kidnapped her.

102
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,508
What?

103
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,925
She came to me.

104
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,430
What?

105
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:17,833
Is that true?

106
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,216
I'll kick your ass
if you ran out on me.

107
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,685
- Don't talk to her like that!
- Don't make me hit you.

108
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:26,564
- I hate it when you make me hit you.
- Dude! I got the gun! Shut the fuck up!

109
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:31,068
Why does he think I kidnapped you?

110
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:33,737
- He raped me too.
- What?

111
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,576
- Cocksucker, that's my girl!
- I didn't rape no one!

112
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:43,333
Give me the gun, baby!

113
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:47,630
You bitch!
Why the fuck did you hit me?

114
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,010
Give me that.

115
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,890
- Could you not make me a rapist?
- I'm sorry.

116
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:57,044
It was the best I could think of.

117
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,207
We better tie him up
before he comes to.

118
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,001
- He's a lot stronger than he looks.
- All right. I'll get my handcuffs.

119
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:03,976
No. He can escape handcuffs.

120
00:10:04,877 --> 00:10:06,520
What?
What is he, a magician?

121
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:11,317
Rope. Trust me.
Bring me rope.

122
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:29,381
The downstairs is clean.

123
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:31,094
I told you there was nothing.

124
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:32,519
It's been wiped.

125
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:35,196
I'm a Virgo.

126
00:10:36,283 --> 00:10:37,426
I like to be neat.

127
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:40,207
Your screeching fang-cushion
of a barmaid,

128
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:43,307
who's been glamoured so much
she can't remember her own last name,

129
00:10:44,242 --> 00:10:48,246
does know that no one goes down there
with so much as a mop and a promise.

130
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:50,814
Suddenly it's as sterile
as an operating room.

131
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,920
It doesn't prove anything.

132
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,461
If only we had a Magister
to decide that.

133
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:01,598
Relax.

134
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:04,075
It's not like you killed someone.

135
00:11:07,478 --> 00:11:09,409
Just need your official statement.

136
00:11:10,534 --> 00:11:11,399
That's all.

137
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,467
Webcams.
For the Authority.

138
00:11:21,658 --> 00:11:24,860
Members of the Authority,
it's Nan. Can you hear me?

139
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,900
Good.

140
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,646
As regards to the matter
of the disappearance of our Magister,

141
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,439
last known whereabouts,

142
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:35,059
this dump in Shreveport, Louisiana.

143
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:38,716
You have before you Eric Northman,
Sheriff of Area Five.

144
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,118
Smile for the cameras.

145
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,160
I spiked it a little.
Looks like you could use it.

146
00:12:14,248 --> 00:12:15,188
Listen.

147
00:12:15,313 --> 00:12:17,985
What you went through sounds like
more than one person can handle.

148
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,289
You're here.

149
00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:22,781
But I don't think
I'm doing too much good.

150
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:30,831
- Have you ever thought about?
- I'm not going to a shrink.

151
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,669
Pour my guts out to a stranger
is the last thing I need.

152
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:38,140
Tell me you'll think about it.

153
00:12:41,476 --> 00:12:42,426
I got it.

154
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,019
You're lucky it's just me.
Arlene's fixing to throw a Molotov

155
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,186
through your brother's window
if you don't get here.

156
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:54,091
Why? What's going on?

157
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:55,898
<i>There's all kinds of noises, Sam.</i>

158
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:57,441
Girl noises.

159
00:12:58,855 --> 00:13:01,753
Ordinarily, I wouldn't keep anybody
from enjoying themselves.

160
00:13:01,878 --> 00:13:03,989
Enjoying?
She sounds like she's being murdered.

161
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:06,658
I got me two kids with school
in the morning

162
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:10,291
and a pregnant woman
who says she needs nine hours sleep.

163
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,105
It's for the baby!

164
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:17,337
I tried knocking on the door,
but they ain't answering.

165
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,945
<i>It's late for you too, but...</i>

166
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,906
No, it's all right.
I'll be right over.

167
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:23,428
Five minutes.

168
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,216
Bend over! God, make me.

169
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:27,471
Come on! Hold on!

170
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:34,019
I gotta run over to the apartments.
You wanna...?

171
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:37,703
All right.

172
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:57,648
There's a pattern.

173
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,543
The Turks told folk tales
of shape shifting jackals

174
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:02,432
at the fall of Constantinople.

175
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,885
The Aztecs were decimated by disease
from the Conquistadors' war dogs.

176
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,637
Each time, there's been wolves

177
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:10,774
fueled by vampire blood.

178
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,101
I nearly found him
in Augsburg in 1945.

179
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,978
His wolves were in the service
of the Wehrmacht.

180
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,496
He disappeared after the war,
and I...

181
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:23,216
<i>I thought
he finally met the true death.</i>

182
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:25,696
<i>Now he's returned.</i>

183
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:27,904
Do you know why?

184
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:29,728
In times of conflict,
Russell Edgington

185
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:31,910
inserts himself
into the affairs of men.

186
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:34,119
To what end?

187
00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:36,998
He claims it's to prevent humans
from destroying the planet

188
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:38,323
and themselves

189
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:41,134
and thus our food source.

190
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:42,671
But Tru Blood changed all that.

191
00:14:43,323 --> 00:14:45,424
Humans are no longer food for us.

192
00:14:45,592 --> 00:14:48,469
- The Great Revelation.
- Russell opposes the Great Revelation.

193
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,837
<i>And he doesn't want
to coexist with humans.</i>

194
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,040
<i>He wants to subjugate them.</i>

195
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:55,979
- The Authority will not...
- <i>Fuck the Authority!</i>

196
00:14:58,801 --> 00:15:00,084
<i>Russell's words.</i>

197
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,661
<i>Verbatim.</i>

198
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,892
This is why he killed the Magister?

199
00:15:08,017 --> 00:15:10,365
No, he killed the Magister
because the Magister defied him.

200
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,493
He kidnapped the Queen
because she refused him.

201
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,711
<i>Now, if the Authority
or the AVL stand in his way,</i>

202
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:17,864
<i>well...</i>

203
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,274
These are treasonous allegations.

204
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,944
- Why didn't you report this?
- I should have.

205
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:29,183
But the Authority has existed
for only a few hundred years.

206
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:34,075
My history with Russell Edgington
goes back nearly a thousand.

207
00:15:39,026 --> 00:15:40,726
My family was massacred.

208
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:45,164
All of them...

209
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:46,777
by wolves.

210
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,341
I managed to kill one

211
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:54,034
and I watched him change into a man
at the end of my sword.

212
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:56,703
And these wolves,

213
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,221
they're the same.

214
00:15:58,768 --> 00:15:59,719
Sweden,

215
00:16:00,148 --> 00:16:01,442
Germany, here.

216
00:16:07,243 --> 00:16:08,593
<i>With all respect,</i>

217
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:11,990
<i>I did not report
Russell Edgington to you,</i>

218
00:16:12,115 --> 00:16:14,763
<i>because I want him to die
at my own hands.</i>

219
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:20,977
<i>I have waited a thousand years
for this.</i>

220
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:30,307
Yes, I understand.

221
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:32,988
I'm flying immediately to Portland.

222
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:34,122
Thank you.

223
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,430
What?

224
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:37,427
Is that it?

225
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:39,734
The Authority
will review your statement

226
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:43,250
against the frankly,
strong possibility

227
00:16:43,862 --> 00:16:46,560
that I've lost an entire night's worth
of air time

228
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:49,256
promoting the VRA in order
to listen to a load of bullshit.

229
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,093
But some do believe
in a fair hearing.

230
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:55,762
Americans.

231
00:16:57,588 --> 00:16:58,640
Miss Flanagan.

232
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,927
Russell Edgington is a threat

233
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:04,962
to our very existence.

234
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:06,565
But he is a king.

235
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:10,246
One who donated a half a million dollars
to the American Vampire League

236
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:12,113
you say he's trying to bring down.

237
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,610
Weird?

238
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:18,674
Bring in a couple of spare coffins
for Sheriff Northman and his...

239
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:20,354
Whatever you are.

240
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:22,677
You're on lockdown

241
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:25,227
till the Authority makes its ruling.

242
00:17:40,737 --> 00:17:43,251
Jump up and down.
Let's see them titties shake.

243
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,566
Jesus, put on some clothes.

244
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,142
Sorry, can't hear you.

245
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:56,223
Let me put on some clothes.

246
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:02,496
From the bar.

247
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:04,101
Yeah.

248
00:18:08,108 --> 00:18:09,336
This here's Nicole.

249
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:10,815
Natalie.

250
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:13,845
It's okay.
We ain't done much talking.

251
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,594
Are you high?

252
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:20,722
I am. You want some?

253
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,352
Do you want me to go?
I don't wanna get you in trouble.

254
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:29,815
He's gonna do nothing.
He's stuck in the mud and drag me in.

255
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:32,067
Seriously, dude.
Look at yourself.

256
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,736
I'm naked, she's naked.
We're partying.

257
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,558
And you're standing there.

258
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,734
How you have a good time's
your own business.

259
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:40,659
Believe me,
I've done it all and more.

260
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,654
Yeah, he says that.

261
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:45,474
Where'd that guy go?

262
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,517
You can't be bothering the neighbors
while they're sleeping.

263
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:53,547
You telling me that
as my landlord or my dad?

264
00:18:57,307 --> 00:19:00,158
Fine. Whatever.
Yes, sir.

265
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,722
We'll keep it down.

266
00:19:02,013 --> 00:19:02,889
That all?

267
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,360
I'll see you in the morning.

268
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:16,225
That's your dad?

269
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,415
Where'd you learn that?

270
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:30,270
- I used to be a rodeo champ.
- Really?

271
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:34,214
Okay, call.

272
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:41,615
<i>Renard Parish Sheriff's Department.</i>

273
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:46,851
There's a guy tied
to a tree by Jefferson Road.

274
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,478
It's about three miles
north of I-20.

275
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:53,805
He's got a bag full
of vampire blood in his pocket.

276
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,368
I think he's some kind
of drug dealer.

277
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,722
<i>Is he in need of medical assistance?</i>

278
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:04,794
- Does he need medical assistance?
- That's good enough. Come on.

279
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:24,817
Shit.

280
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,002
You should have let me sleep
last night.

281
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,727
Got a 12-hour shift.

282
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,819
Hey, Ruby, you almost done in there?

283
00:20:32,944 --> 00:20:34,774
It's time for us to go home.

284
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,320
You have got a excellent
selection of cosmetics.

285
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,012
I'll give you that.
I'm ready for you now.

286
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,908
Can't nothing hurt me
when I got on my war paint.

287
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:49,144
Something different about you.

288
00:20:49,635 --> 00:20:50,985
I don't think so.

289
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:54,992
You ain't got your mask on.

290
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:56,963
'Cause you been in there
hogging all my stuff.

291
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,006
I see you.

292
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:00,383
My son is shining through.

293
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:06,362
Did he do this to you?

294
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:13,438
I guess you can say that.

295
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:15,954
I'll be damned.

296
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,370
Maybe God loves fags.

297
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:23,078
That sounds like a compliment.

298
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,135
Ruby, we gotta go. Come on.

299
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:27,770
You need to bless the Jell-O
so everyone can eat. Come on.

300
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,582
All right, now.
You go ahead.

301
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:31,007
Without my ring.

302
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,272
Come see me, La La.

303
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:37,420
All right, Miss Lady.
Eat your vegetables.

304
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:45,739
- So I'll see you?
- When I see you.

305
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,946
- What happened?
- Who's she?

306
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:05,767
This is Crystal.

307
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:08,412
She's with me for the day.
It's like a ride-along.

308
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:11,488
You okay?

309
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:13,247
We had a man down last night.

310
00:22:15,445 --> 00:22:17,001
- Which man?
- Kevin!

311
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,923
He's alive, barely.
His mama's at the hospital with him.

312
00:22:24,596 --> 00:22:25,786
What happened?

313
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,929
He went to answer
a distress call around 2 a.m.

314
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:30,056
I thought it was a crank.

315
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,286
Some moron called
disguising his voice,

316
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:36,299
said that there was a guy tied to a tree
holding a bag full of vamp blood.

317
00:22:36,424 --> 00:22:37,624
I didn't know.

318
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,035
We sent our man into an ambush.

319
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,655
They smashed him up like a piñata.
Crushed his windpipe.

320
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:48,199
Boy's impossible
to understand as it is.

321
00:22:49,216 --> 00:22:51,285
- Shit.
- That's awful.

322
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:52,954
Goddamn it.

323
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,540
Can't be losing deputies
my first week.

324
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:59,485
He's the only man I ever loved.

325
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:05,639
I gotta go type up a statement.

326
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:07,401
Just give me one second.

327
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:22,228
Taking our boy to his arraignment.

328
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:36,664
I'm real tore up about this thing
with Kev.

329
00:23:37,306 --> 00:23:38,807
What you want, a hug?

330
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:44,464
I got ulcers so big,
coffee's coming out of my bellybutton.

331
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:47,133
Is that even possible?

332
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,637
You got three seconds.

333
00:23:52,872 --> 00:23:55,433
I got an idea
about who might have done it.

334
00:23:56,925 --> 00:23:59,144
Did we find a bag of V at the scene?

335
00:24:00,124 --> 00:24:03,128
Kenya put it in evidence,
along with some guy's clothes.

336
00:24:03,253 --> 00:24:04,653
Word on the street

337
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,645
is that the meth lab
we busted in Hotshot,

338
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,237
they're dealing V now.

339
00:24:10,602 --> 00:24:11,824
Where'd you hear that?

340
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:16,054
You want your cops
to protect their sources, don't you?

341
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:17,953
You ain't a...

342
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:22,743
Just go on.

343
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:27,068
I was thinking,
if we can connect the V

344
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:30,631
from the fuck-knuckle who jumped
Kevin back to Hotshot,

345
00:24:31,258 --> 00:24:34,320
then that would give us probable cause
to raid 'em again, right?

346
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,309
But you probably
thought of that already.

347
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,436
It's one of several theories I got.

348
00:24:41,322 --> 00:24:43,011
Got a call into the lab.

349
00:24:43,136 --> 00:24:44,436
I tell you what.

350
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:47,764
If it turns out our V addict
is from Hotshot,

351
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:50,471
I'm calling in the FBI, the DEA,

352
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:55,213
the ATF, the DOJ and Blackwater,
and we're gonna send that shit hole

353
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:57,702
back into the slime
it climbed up out of!

354
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:00,247
I'm behind you, boss.

355
00:25:00,557 --> 00:25:02,207
All the way to the end zone.

356
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:05,356
And if you need any muscle
with Kev gone.

357
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,257
Go make sure Rosie hasn't
drowned at her own desk.

358
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:38,278
- That was my cousin.
- Really?

359
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,316
Right? From Merlotte's?

360
00:25:46,407 --> 00:25:48,838
Everybody, this is my friend
from my new job.

361
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,640
We ain't hardly had a chance
to know each other,

362
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:54,135
but guess we're in the boat
together now, huh?

363
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,337
I don't know.
I'm not even sure why I...

364
00:25:56,462 --> 00:25:57,430
Don't worry.

365
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,723
We ain't as scary as we look.
I promise.

366
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:06,454
How about I start.

367
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:11,068
Hey, y'all.
I'm Holly.

368
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,529
It's been a while since I spoke,

369
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,991
but there's enough new faces here,

370
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:19,626
I figure I ought to take a turn.

371
00:26:22,138 --> 00:26:23,289
I'm a rape survivor.

372
00:26:23,978 --> 00:26:25,628
Easy for me to say now,

373
00:26:25,843 --> 00:26:28,931
but took me ages to be able
to put those words together.

374
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,576
And it's women like y'all
who helped me the whole way.

375
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,580
Fifteen years ago

376
00:26:36,952 --> 00:26:38,552
I was locked in a room

377
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,061
and raped by my coworker
for five and a half hours.

378
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,280
And every day

379
00:26:44,676 --> 00:26:47,313
I face not only my memory of that,

380
00:26:48,268 --> 00:26:49,968
but that part of me who...

381
00:26:50,297 --> 00:26:52,151
Who wants to feel sorry for herself,

382
00:26:52,926 --> 00:26:54,923
and expects the worst out of people.

383
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:57,843
But that's not
who I was raised to be.

384
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,696
And I still believe

385
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,239
that people are worth trusting,

386
00:27:05,364 --> 00:27:07,414
and every day, that piece of me

387
00:27:08,203 --> 00:27:09,877
gets a tiny bit stronger

388
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:14,220
and wins out just a tiny bit more.

389
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:56,299
It's Hadley.
What are you doing in your house?

390
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:58,550
I told you to leave Bon Temps.
They're coming for you.

391
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,956
They came,
they gave it their best shot

392
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:02,138
and I'm still here.

393
00:28:02,572 --> 00:28:03,913
Come on, I'm begging you.

394
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:06,058
You and Jason are
the only family I got left.

395
00:28:06,507 --> 00:28:07,476
Where are you?

396
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:13,617
Sook, do you think you could come
to the aquarium in Monroe?

397
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:15,985
I got someone I need you to meet.

398
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:29,638
Stay right here. I'll be right back.

399
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:33,265
Oh, my God. Is that...?

400
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,379
I took him out of day care.
His daddy doesn't know.

401
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,790
I haven't seen my son
in over a year.

402
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:40,392
Sweetie, you're gonna lose him for good
if you don't bring him back.

403
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:42,418
- Did anybody follow you?
- What?

404
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:45,766
Whatever it is you're
not telling me, now is the time.

405
00:28:49,086 --> 00:28:50,644
Shit. I screwed up.

406
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,885
I got involved with a vampire.

407
00:28:56,457 --> 00:28:58,107
Her name's Sophie-Anne.

408
00:28:58,645 --> 00:29:00,321
She's the Vampire Queen
of Louisiana.

409
00:29:01,895 --> 00:29:03,345
Are you kidding me?

410
00:29:04,581 --> 00:29:05,981
I told her things.

411
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,914
I told her about you
and the powers you got.

412
00:29:10,385 --> 00:29:12,761
- Why would you do that?
- I didn't think anything of it,

413
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:14,640
but then suddenly
she got interested,

414
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:17,630
and now I think Russell
Edgington is interested.

415
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,415
Shit. It's my stupid fault
all these vampires are after you.

416
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,341
- What do they want with me?
- They don't think like regular people.

417
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:25,720
I don't know why they do
half the things they do.

418
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:28,891
But you just... You gotta get out
of Bon Temps. Please.

419
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,917
I'll find someplace to lay low.

420
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:32,520
Why haven't you left?

421
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,982
Hunter, sweetie, come say hi
to your Aunt Sookie.

422
00:29:42,722 --> 00:29:44,822
I need to know if he's like you.

423
00:29:45,308 --> 00:29:48,109
Please. If he is,
I have to protect him.

424
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:52,322
Hunter, come on, sweetie.
Come on, baby.

425
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:53,582
<i>Who is this lady?</i>

426
00:29:54,078 --> 00:29:55,960
<i>Where's Daddy?
Why isn't he here?</i>

427
00:29:57,974 --> 00:30:00,506
It's okay.
We don't have to talk.

428
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:02,829
Come on.

429
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,354
<i>Which is your favorite fish
in the aquarium?</i>

430
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:19,692
<i>It's all right. No one knows.
Just us.</i>

431
00:30:24,107 --> 00:30:25,156
<i>The blue one.</i>

432
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,409
<i>The blue one's nice.
I like the orange one too.</i>

433
00:30:30,234 --> 00:30:32,872
<i>You don't have to be scared.
Your mama loves you very much.</i>

434
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,673
<i>Mama's real scared too.</i>

435
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:37,376
<i>Mama's more scared than me.</i>

436
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:42,525
Sweet Lord, no.

437
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:47,760
We have to go.

438
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,366
- Where are you taking him?
- I got some friends.

439
00:30:53,491 --> 00:30:55,988
The less you know, the better.
Come on, baby.

440
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,397
- She knows! She knows!
- Come on!

441
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:07,006
That's great. Thank you.

442
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,561
- Where's the rest?
- It's all on the table.

443
00:31:20,686 --> 00:31:22,922
My white ass, it is.
This here's $2.

444
00:31:23,187 --> 00:31:24,499
Sounds good to me.

445
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:26,375
Four Daughters of the Confederacy

446
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,769
with French manicures just told me
I was the best server they ever had.

447
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,223
- Don't tell me they left me $2!
- It ain't my fault they're cheap.

448
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,191
- We can hear you in the dining room.
- In all the years that you've known me,

449
00:31:38,316 --> 00:31:40,379
since when has a four-top
left me a $2 tip?

450
00:31:40,504 --> 00:31:42,066
I don't have your money.

451
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,568
Turn that fucker upside down
and shake it out of him.

452
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,258
- I'd like to see him try.
- Settle down.

453
00:31:47,383 --> 00:31:49,907
Sam, if that little runt
keeps stealing my tips,

454
00:31:50,432 --> 00:31:51,909
I'm gonna need a raise.

455
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,536
That's a good one. A raise?

456
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:57,039
For what?
Service that fucking sucks?

457
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,666
I'm taking
that money out of your salary.

458
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,301
Nice. So you're gonna
take her word over mine?

459
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,805
Shit. Is there anyone
you don't let walk all over you?

460
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:15,142
Un-fucking-believable.

461
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,683
I've had two boys just like him.

462
00:32:37,243 --> 00:32:39,205
You ain't ever gonna get
him to admit he took it,

463
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:42,584
but dollars to doughnuts, he ain't ever
gonna try to pull that on you again.

464
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,799
God, time was this was
a nice place to come to work.

465
00:32:50,188 --> 00:32:51,488
I've seen worse.

466
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,630
A lot worse.

467
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:56,713
I mean, the kids, God love 'em,

468
00:32:56,838 --> 00:32:59,892
but coming here was
the best part of my day.

469
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:04,030
You still get to eye your man
through the kitchen window.

470
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:05,773
That's worth something, ain't it?

471
00:33:07,717 --> 00:33:09,695
I don't know for how much longer.

472
00:33:14,098 --> 00:33:15,498
The baby coming...

473
00:33:18,156 --> 00:33:19,204
it ain't his.

474
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,653
I never said that till now.

475
00:33:27,097 --> 00:33:30,257
The daddy, he's gone.
He's dead.

476
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:32,869
But that man

477
00:33:33,973 --> 00:33:36,218
was pure evil.

478
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,393
I'm bringing an evil child
into this world.

479
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,140
I know I am.

480
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,648
And sooner or later,
Terry's gonna find out.

481
00:33:49,186 --> 00:33:50,886
I got a time bomb in me.

482
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:54,669
Six and a half months left
of fooling myself and everybody else

483
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:57,780
before the best man
that ever walked through my door

484
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:59,705
gets blown to smithereens.

485
00:34:02,983 --> 00:34:05,283
How am I supposed to live with that?

486
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:11,121
You want this baby?

487
00:34:24,865 --> 00:34:25,865
I don't.

488
00:34:26,737 --> 00:34:28,887
I can't believe I just said that.

489
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:33,866
You need someone
to go with you to the clinic?

490
00:34:35,971 --> 00:34:37,824
I can't do that.
No, that is wrong.

491
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:39,344
It's plain wrong.

492
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:42,044
That's your business.

493
00:34:42,555 --> 00:34:44,405
But you ain't no time bomb.

494
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,126
There's other ways to resolve it.

495
00:34:58,826 --> 00:34:59,976
Come on, now.

496
00:36:24,771 --> 00:36:25,933
No, it's impossible.

497
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:29,645
This is daylight.

498
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:31,334
How did you...?

499
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:33,398
You killed her.

500
00:36:35,424 --> 00:36:36,424
Come back!

501
00:36:56,969 --> 00:36:58,966
- You killed Sookie.
- I haven't.

502
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:01,635
You've taken her blood.
I can see it in you.

503
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:04,606
- I love her.
- You think you do.

504
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:07,719
You only want her light.

505
00:37:10,346 --> 00:37:11,396
She's safe.

506
00:37:12,476 --> 00:37:15,624
She's alive. I swear to you,
I would never harm her.

507
00:37:15,911 --> 00:37:18,694
Leave her alone, vampire.
We will protect her.

508
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:20,529
How have you ever protected her?

509
00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:23,073
We have. Believe me.

510
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:27,661
- Who is we?
- Now, why would I tell you that?

511
00:37:27,977 --> 00:37:30,205
Sookie needs to know what she is,

512
00:37:30,947 --> 00:37:33,500
so that she can protect herself.
Please.

513
00:37:34,857 --> 00:37:36,707
What in God's name are you?

514
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,287
Did you sleep at all?

515
00:37:56,205 --> 00:37:57,205
I'm fine.

516
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,378
Are the guards still outside?

517
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:08,785
Whatever the Authority decides,

518
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,079
I will not allow you
to take any responsibility.

519
00:38:11,796 --> 00:38:13,582
You didn't kill the Magister.

520
00:38:15,315 --> 00:38:17,752
But politically,
I'm a much cleaner scapegoat.

521
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:19,743
Who's easier to pin it on?

522
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:23,247
The Sheriff in your custody
or a king who might be anywhere?

523
00:38:24,243 --> 00:38:27,512
And if they search Russell's palace,
they'll find the remains of his lover.

524
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:30,605
- What did he do to you?
- Nothing.

525
00:38:31,871 --> 00:38:34,969
But he was the nearest thing
to Russell Edgington's heart.

526
00:38:35,787 --> 00:38:37,271
He had to die.

527
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:39,936
A hundred years I've been with you.

528
00:38:40,641 --> 00:38:44,071
Why did you never say anything
about Russell or your family?

529
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,864
You didn't need to know.

530
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:49,438
What good would it do
to share my pain with you?

531
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:51,536
You didn't need to carry
it all by yourself.

532
00:38:51,978 --> 00:38:53,205
I am not weak.

533
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:56,124
I was the sole survivor.

534
00:38:59,877 --> 00:39:01,419
The burden is mine alone.

535
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,763
We've lived through
so much for so long.

536
00:39:08,452 --> 00:39:10,252
It can't end this quickly.

537
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:12,621
Everything ends.

538
00:39:14,945 --> 00:39:16,395
Even the immortals.

539
00:39:24,402 --> 00:39:25,702
If I can't go on

540
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,324
you must make a new vampire.

541
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:34,162
It is your time to be a maker.

542
00:39:50,104 --> 00:39:52,222
I am so hungry, I could eat a horse.

543
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,655
Two?

544
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,994
- This here's...
- Follow me.

545
00:40:14,935 --> 00:40:16,350
You ain't even gonna say hi?

546
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:19,818
You could always come during the day
or on nights when I'm not working.

547
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:21,971
There's even other places
you can go eat.

548
00:40:23,065 --> 00:40:24,129
This is my place.

549
00:40:24,854 --> 00:40:26,673
I've been coming here for years.

550
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,634
Besides, you called it off,
so, what do you care?

551
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:32,227
I don't.

552
00:40:32,854 --> 00:40:33,680
It's fine.

553
00:40:36,365 --> 00:40:39,227
Well, then in that case,
I'd like for you to meet Summer.

554
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,147
Jessica, I have heard so much.

555
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,817
Shit.

556
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:49,362
She didn't mean it.

557
00:41:01,852 --> 00:41:03,210
I am so proud of you.

558
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:04,795
Why?

559
00:41:05,274 --> 00:41:07,339
Because you chose life.

560
00:41:07,853 --> 00:41:10,008
I love vampires
as much as anyone else,

561
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,551
but they have no life in them.

562
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,952
Look how sad she is without you.

563
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,438
She pulled you into the night.

564
00:41:24,163 --> 00:41:26,817
I'm just so thankful
you chose to come back with me.

565
00:41:28,164 --> 00:41:30,864
Can't do much antiquing after dark,
can we?

566
00:41:32,914 --> 00:41:34,914
I saw the look in T-Dub's eye.

567
00:41:35,263 --> 00:41:36,576
He thinks I'm the snitch.

568
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,615
Why else would I be
at the Police station?

569
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,990
You gotta quit worrying about them.

570
00:41:41,262 --> 00:41:42,262
Tea-Bag,

571
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:45,169
he's in your rear-view, darling.

572
00:41:46,585 --> 00:41:48,892
Because I got
the sheriff's ear today,

573
00:41:49,017 --> 00:41:49,965
and we...

574
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,883
are gonna bust Hotshot.

575
00:41:53,926 --> 00:41:54,719
What?

576
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,463
Round 'em all up
and take 'em all down.

577
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,350
So you just lay low for a day,
maybe two.

578
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,060
What's gonna happen to 'em all?

579
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,395
They'll go to jail.

580
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,106
They're my kin.

581
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,817
We gotta get up there and warn 'em.

582
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:13,488
You'll go running back to the people
you've been trying to get away from?

583
00:42:13,843 --> 00:42:16,616
Back to Felton, who hit you
and almost killed Kev?

584
00:42:19,062 --> 00:42:20,951
How'd he get away anyway?

585
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,325
We strung him up like Christmas ham.

586
00:42:24,132 --> 00:42:26,621
There are folks up there
that don't touch the drugs.

587
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:28,378
And the kids,

588
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:30,172
they don't know nothing else.

589
00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:33,125
You can't send them into the system.

590
00:42:35,515 --> 00:42:36,511
You can't.

591
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:43,453
A visit from the chef.

592
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:45,329
It's my lucky day.

593
00:42:45,454 --> 00:42:48,148
I wanted to meet the sick fuck
who ordered the veggie burger

594
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,532
with bacon.

595
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,033
I was just curious to see
if you'd actually do it.

596
00:42:52,158 --> 00:42:52,986
For you,

597
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,152
I'd do all kinds of things
against my better judgment.

598
00:42:56,892 --> 00:43:00,076
That's why I come back.
For the personal service.

599
00:43:01,326 --> 00:43:02,926
You don't finish that,

600
00:43:04,105 --> 00:43:06,281
then you ain't getting no dessert.

601
00:43:15,892 --> 00:43:17,792
The nurse from Meadow Glade?

602
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:19,916
Is this a thing?

603
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:22,076
If you call
two days in a row a thing.

604
00:43:22,201 --> 00:43:23,799
For me, it's a record.

605
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,895
Still plenty of time for it
to blow up in your face.

606
00:43:28,361 --> 00:43:29,898
Well, fuck you too.

607
00:43:30,981 --> 00:43:32,202
I didn't mean...

608
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:34,387
Never mind.
That's just...

609
00:43:35,578 --> 00:43:36,928
Forget I said it.

610
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:39,866
Ain't no reason
why you shouldn't trust him.

611
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,600
I told him all the shit about me,
and he keeps coming back.

612
00:43:44,891 --> 00:43:47,491
I don't know if he a fool
or a fucking...

613
00:43:48,282 --> 00:43:49,125
miracle.

614
00:43:50,403 --> 00:43:53,638
If he can handle your mama,
I'd go with miracle.

615
00:43:53,763 --> 00:43:54,863
Hallelujahs.

616
00:43:55,201 --> 00:43:57,133
Bless Jehovah,
it's about fucking time.

617
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:04,140
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

618
00:44:05,327 --> 00:44:06,977
No, I'm happy for you, baby.

619
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:14,860
I'll be right back.

620
00:44:17,263 --> 00:44:18,513
Guard my dolls.

621
00:44:29,202 --> 00:44:31,252
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

622
00:44:32,193 --> 00:44:34,004
I didn't mean
to scare your girlfriend.

623
00:44:34,767 --> 00:44:37,215
It's all right.
Couldn't help yourself.

624
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:40,177
She seems...

625
00:44:42,863 --> 00:44:43,930
short.

626
00:44:45,696 --> 00:44:46,808
We can't all...

627
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,479
So she know you hate dolls?

628
00:44:54,478 --> 00:44:56,109
We don't really talk much about me.

629
00:44:58,497 --> 00:44:59,946
Does she at least make you happy?

630
00:45:06,953 --> 00:45:07,953
I hate her.

631
00:45:08,952 --> 00:45:11,082
God help me, but I fucking hate her.

632
00:45:11,826 --> 00:45:14,294
Everything is dolls and show tunes

633
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:17,213
and cleaning stuff
and she will not stop talking.

634
00:45:17,964 --> 00:45:19,758
And I feel
like it's making me crazy.

635
00:45:23,162 --> 00:45:24,763
Then what are you doing with her?

636
00:45:28,637 --> 00:45:30,852
Guess it beats sitting around
thinking about you.

637
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:48,763
You okay?

638
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,174
Come on.

639
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,699
What the fuck is your problem?

640
00:46:17,638 --> 00:46:18,788
Is he inside?

641
00:46:24,747 --> 00:46:25,747
Look.

642
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:29,786
The American Vampire League
protects your murderer.

643
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,413
Perhaps they even sent him.

644
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:36,393
They will suffer for their sins,
my beloved.

645
00:46:36,518 --> 00:46:37,854
I swear...

646
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:39,730
to you...

647
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:41,423
they...

648
00:46:42,368 --> 00:46:43,368
will...

649
00:46:44,086 --> 00:46:45,086
suffer.

650
00:47:03,986 --> 00:47:05,113
You look like shit.

651
00:47:05,575 --> 00:47:07,157
Well, I feel fantastic.

652
00:47:07,638 --> 00:47:09,826
The ruling is as follows:

653
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,460
The Authority disavows
any knowledge of our interview,

654
00:47:19,011 --> 00:47:22,005
your statement or, indeed,
this ruling itself.

655
00:47:22,762 --> 00:47:24,591
None of this ever happened.

656
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:26,011
What?

657
00:47:27,007 --> 00:47:29,073
Missing royals, dead Magisters.

658
00:47:29,198 --> 00:47:31,425
It's a political tar, baby,
no one wants to touch

659
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,933
not with the VRA
this close to ratification.

660
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,935
Russell will not stop killing.

661
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:39,119
What if the human public
learns of it?

662
00:47:39,244 --> 00:47:41,149
That's why
you're going to take care of it.

663
00:47:42,007 --> 00:47:44,110
Quietly, discreetly,

664
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,075
and most important of all,
completely off the books.

665
00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:48,769
You wanted revenge,

666
00:47:49,722 --> 00:47:50,742
it's yours.

667
00:47:52,209 --> 00:47:53,953
What resources
are you gonna give me?

668
00:47:55,192 --> 00:47:57,832
- We're not getting near it.
- How do you expect me to kill him?

669
00:47:58,323 --> 00:48:00,023
He's three times my age.

670
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:03,999
Listen, you whiny little bitch.

671
00:48:04,385 --> 00:48:06,132
The only link between Sophie-Anne,

672
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,400
Russell and the Magister is you.

673
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:11,182
You brought us
this steaming pile of shit

674
00:48:11,307 --> 00:48:13,473
and you're going to make it go away.

675
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,768
Bring me his fangs,
or I will have yours.

676
00:48:30,729 --> 00:48:32,416
He did it once, he'll do it...

677
00:48:34,504 --> 00:48:35,662
Stay there, baby.

678
00:48:36,053 --> 00:48:37,455
You little two-faced whore.

679
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,332
Watch your mouth, old man.

680
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,903
Oh, yeah? Fuck you.

681
00:48:41,028 --> 00:48:43,419
That's my daughter.
You think you can turn on your people?

682
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,130
Who do you think you are?
I didn't raise no snitch!

683
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:48,216
You are not welcome here.

684
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,028
You got a problem, take it outside.

685
00:48:50,153 --> 00:48:51,339
Let's go, daddy-O.

686
00:48:51,464 --> 00:48:52,277
And you?

687
00:48:52,402 --> 00:48:55,014
- You said you hadn't seen her.
- That's true. I hadn't seen the kid.

688
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,729
You can't man up to your own lies,
you fucking pussy.

689
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,500
Come on,
let's get the hell out of here.

690
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,136
Who's a pussy?
Who's a fucking pussy?

691
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,034
That's my daddy!

692
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,920
You fucker!

693
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,838
You gotta stop him!

694
00:49:31,403 --> 00:49:32,925
Get his arm, Hoyt.

695
00:49:35,562 --> 00:49:36,562
Easy.

696
00:49:52,847 --> 00:49:54,657
He's still breathing,
but he's in bad shape.

697
00:49:54,987 --> 00:49:56,612
All right, hold on one second.

698
00:49:56,737 --> 00:49:57,837
You got him?

699
00:49:58,037 --> 00:49:59,237
Grab his legs.

700
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:00,955
Listen, bro.

701
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,541
You gotta meet me
at the ER door in 20.

702
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,112
Thanks, bro. I owe you.

703
00:50:05,237 --> 00:50:06,625
He said come on down.

704
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,400
Come on, man, let's go!

705
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:12,926
Wait!

706
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,185
Wait! Stop!

707
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:17,219
You can't fucking go with him.

708
00:50:19,024 --> 00:50:20,475
That son of a bitch used you.

709
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:21,601
You hate him.

710
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,519
My daddy is the only one I got.

711
00:50:24,061 --> 00:50:26,856
If you can't understand that,
you don't know a thing about me at all.

712
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,150
Crystal, I know
when you're being an idiot.

713
00:50:29,342 --> 00:50:32,727
You're running right back to the people
who've been controlling your life.

714
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,277
You're right.

715
00:50:34,402 --> 00:50:36,295
I don't need no one
controlling my life.

716
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,034
Especially not fucking you!

717
00:50:43,352 --> 00:50:44,352
Fuck!

718
00:50:53,268 --> 00:50:54,390
Don't.

719
00:50:54,515 --> 00:50:56,427
It's an ugly, ugly sound.

720
00:51:02,076 --> 00:51:03,226
I killed you.

721
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,515
That's what everyone said,
that you did it.

722
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,965
I thought, why would anyone
spread such vicious lies?

723
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:10,140
Why would you kill
someone that you loved?

724
00:51:10,265 --> 00:51:11,734
I do not love you.

725
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:14,237
They said that too.

726
00:51:15,077 --> 00:51:16,927
That, I refused to believe.

727
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:19,192
I had to see for myself.

728
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,142
You wanna know what hurts the most?

729
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:25,998
You didn't mourn.

730
00:51:26,826 --> 00:51:29,396
If you had a shred of love

731
00:51:30,002 --> 00:51:31,963
in your heart for me,

732
00:51:33,076 --> 00:51:35,550
you would have mourned me.

733
00:51:37,763 --> 00:51:40,000
I love you so much.

734
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:42,301
You don't love anything.

735
00:51:43,286 --> 00:51:44,286
You can't.

736
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,704
Because you are a psychopath.

737
00:51:49,118 --> 00:51:50,865
You violated me

738
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,735
and terrorized me,
because that's what vampires do.

739
00:51:54,202 --> 00:51:56,154
And you are calling that love.

740
00:51:58,075 --> 00:51:59,365
I'll mourn you, Tara.

741
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,630
I'll mourn you to my very marrow.

742
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:07,623
The only pity
is you will never know how much...

743
00:52:08,947 --> 00:52:10,042
I will grieve.

744
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,798
Come on! If you're gonna
fucking kill me, kill me!

745
00:52:16,353 --> 00:52:18,153
What's taking you so long?

746
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,762
You want to hear me beg for my life?

747
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:21,980
Is that it?

748
00:52:22,855 --> 00:52:24,729
It's the only thing y'all can feel.

749
00:52:24,854 --> 00:52:27,435
The destruction of life,
because you ain't got none in you.

750
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:29,604
You sick motherfucker,

751
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,522
I won't give you the satisfaction!

752
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:33,957
Why do you want to die so much?

753
00:52:34,082 --> 00:52:35,777
Why do you want to make me kill you?

754
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:40,003
Because the second I'm gone,
I'll be rid of you forever.

755
00:52:40,128 --> 00:52:42,617
I'll be free
and you'll have nothing!

756
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:43,785
Shut up!

757
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:52,246
Your heart is beating so fast.

758
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:57,088
I want to feel it stop.

759
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,134
Take your hands off her.

760
00:53:03,616 --> 00:53:06,265
This is a private conversation.
It's none of your concern.

761
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,261
Run along.

762
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:09,018
Move the fuck away.

763
00:53:11,498 --> 00:53:12,939
What, you gonna shoot me now?

764
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:16,681
You do realize I'm a vampire.

765
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:20,372
You could empty every round in me,

766
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:21,781
and I'll heal.

767
00:53:29,716 --> 00:53:31,582
Not if I got wooden bullets.

768
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:42,875
Please, come on in.

769
00:53:43,909 --> 00:53:46,206
Where have you been?
I've been calling you for hours.

770
00:53:46,331 --> 00:53:47,598
I dunno how to explain it.

771
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:51,769
Like I was only away for a few minutes,
and then suddenly it was past 11.

772
00:53:51,971 --> 00:53:53,621
You mean you overslept?

773
00:53:54,158 --> 00:53:55,158
Listen.

774
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:56,847
Where did you go?

775
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,820
- Did you visit the Queen?
- The Queen? Why would I?

776
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,530
Do you know the Queen of Louisiana?

777
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:03,698
Well, yes.

778
00:54:03,965 --> 00:54:05,223
I was her subject.

779
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:08,551
I saw my cousin today,
she said she used to be with the Queen.

780
00:54:08,676 --> 00:54:10,913
And now the Queen is working
with Russell to come after me

781
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,779
and anyone else like me.

782
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,710
Do you know anything about that?

783
00:54:18,349 --> 00:54:20,423
I think I know why they want you.

784
00:54:20,959 --> 00:54:22,550
Why didn't you say anything?

785
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:23,926
I only learned it today.

786
00:54:24,534 --> 00:54:25,553
I'm not sure

787
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,071
what it was or...

788
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:28,859
how I even got there.

789
00:54:28,984 --> 00:54:31,309
Perhaps it's because
I had drunk so much of your blood.

790
00:54:36,662 --> 00:54:38,162
I know what you are.

791
00:54:44,703 --> 00:54:46,853
We're heading to the airport now.

792
00:54:47,846 --> 00:54:49,533
I've got the speech here.

793
00:54:49,658 --> 00:54:52,291
I'll have it all memorized
by the time we land in Oregon.

794
00:54:53,784 --> 00:54:55,484
No, go ahead. I'll hold.

795
00:55:14,407 --> 00:55:15,394
Miss Flanagan.

796
00:55:16,615 --> 00:55:19,293
<i>Recapping the top stories this evening,
in Salem, Oregon,</i>

797
00:55:19,418 --> 00:55:21,692
<i>both pro and anti-vampire advocates,</i>

798
00:55:21,969 --> 00:55:25,193
rallied in anticipation of the state's
upcoming ratification vote

799
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:27,138
on the Vampire Rights Amendment.

800
00:55:27,378 --> 00:55:30,449
Polls show the measure gaining support
in recent months,

801
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:33,981
although nearly 20 percent
of the country remains undecided.

802
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:41,285
<i>Does that help you decide, America?</i>

803
00:55:41,637 --> 00:55:43,487
<i>Do not turn off the camera!</i>

804
00:55:45,386 --> 00:55:47,206
<i>You've seen how quickly I can kill.</i>

805
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,142
Ladies and gentlemen...

806
00:55:55,575 --> 00:55:56,575
my name...

807
00:55:57,667 --> 00:55:59,179
is Russell Edgington,

808
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:03,424
and I have been a vampire
for nearly 3000 years.

809
00:56:04,329 --> 00:56:05,121
Now,

810
00:56:05,697 --> 00:56:08,699
the American Vampire League
wishes to perpetrate the notion

811
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:10,438
that we are just like you,

812
00:56:10,572 --> 00:56:13,796
and I suppose
in a few small ways we are.

813
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:15,079
We're narcissists.

814
00:56:15,764 --> 00:56:17,823
<i>We care only about
getting what we want,</i>

815
00:56:17,948 --> 00:56:20,398
<i>no matter what the cost,
just like you.</i>

816
00:56:20,573 --> 00:56:21,998
<i>Global warming,</i>

817
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,062
<i>perpetual war, toxic waste,</i>

818
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:27,928
<i>child labor, torture, genocide.</i>
<i>That's a small price to pay</i>

819
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:30,886
for your SUVs
and your flat-screen TVs,

820
00:56:31,011 --> 00:56:33,777
your blood diamonds,
your designer jeans,

821
00:56:33,902 --> 00:56:36,934
your absurd, garish McMansions!

822
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:41,104
<i>Futile symbols of permanence
to quell your...</i>

823
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:42,951
quivering,

824
00:56:43,496 --> 00:56:45,958
spineless souls.

825
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:51,639
But no.

826
00:56:52,358 --> 00:56:53,408
In the end,

827
00:56:54,363 --> 00:56:56,396
we are...

828
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:58,926
nothing like you.

829
00:56:59,138 --> 00:57:00,399
We are...

830
00:57:03,161 --> 00:57:04,325
immortal.

831
00:57:05,198 --> 00:57:07,298
Because we drink the true blood,

832
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,260
blood that is living,
organic and human.

833
00:57:14,324 --> 00:57:16,231
<i>And that is the truth</i>

834
00:57:16,356 --> 00:57:18,894
<i>the AVL wishes to conceal from you.</i>

835
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,225
Because let's face it, eating people
is a tough sell these days.

836
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:26,764
So they put on their friendly faces
to pass their beloved VRA,

837
00:57:26,889 --> 00:57:28,174
but make no mistake,

838
00:57:28,299 --> 00:57:32,275
mine is the true face of vampires!

839
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:39,916
Why...

840
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:43,179
would we seek...

841
00:57:44,071 --> 00:57:45,911
equal rights?

842
00:57:47,744 --> 00:57:48,824
You...

843
00:57:49,697 --> 00:57:52,467
are not our equals.

844
00:57:54,198 --> 00:57:55,598
We will eat you...

845
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,931
after we eat your children.

846
00:58:01,448 --> 00:58:02,760
Now time for the weather.

847
00:58:02,885 --> 00:58:03,885
Tiffany?
