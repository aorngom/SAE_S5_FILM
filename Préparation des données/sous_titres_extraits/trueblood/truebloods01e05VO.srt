1
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:25,702
We've had a difficult relationship
with law enforcement for many years.

2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,785
The man provoked me.

3
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:31,255
- I could've done much worse.
- I'm sure you could have.

4
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:34,009
And if I wasn't there,
you probably would've killed that man.

5
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:36,176
- Hardly.
- Would you have bit him?

6
00:00:37,326 --> 00:00:39,016
See? That's just crazy.

7
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:42,513
You would've fed on him then tossed him
aside like and old chicken bone.

8
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:45,178
And don't tell me
that's what vampires do.

9
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:49,248
I'm doing my best to mainstream.

10
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:52,418
Suckin' the blood from a police officer
is not mainstreaming.

11
00:00:52,592 --> 00:00:56,126
Neither is hosting orgies
or listening to crazy Chinese gargling.

12
00:00:56,512 --> 00:00:58,353
- It's Tuvan throat singin'.
- Whatever.

13
00:00:58,514 --> 00:01:00,770
Tuvan? I don't even know
where that is.

14
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:05,108
You cannot be frightened of everything
you don't know in this world.

15
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:07,525
Well, my world's
openin' up mighty fast.

16
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:10,861
And what I got here may be boring,
but it's safe.

17
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:12,827
And after the past
couple of nights,

18
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:14,953
safe sounds pretty good about now.

19
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:16,973
No, thank you.

20
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:19,458
I can get this door myself.

21
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,221
I won't call on you again.

24
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:26,676
Stupid... fuckin'... bitch.

25
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:29,096
Bring it on, hooker.
I was all-parish in high school.

26
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:31,582
Boy, I knew there was
some stupid genes in our family,

27
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:34,505
but you must've gotten 'em all.
When did you start dealin' V?

28
00:03:34,712 --> 00:03:37,238
- You want some? You can use it.
- You makin' jokes about it?

29
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:39,762
You gonna get killed,
you dumb motherfucker.

30
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:43,805
Is this 'cause I'm sellin' V
or 'cause I sold it to your sweet Jason?

31
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,762
Givin' vampire blood to Jason
is like givin' Ho Hos to a diabetic.

32
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:50,980
- You know he can't control himself.
- I was very clear on how to use it.

33
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,836
It ain't my fault
he didn't listen.

34
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:55,275
I had to take him
to the ER.

35
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,659
They drained his penis
with a needle the size of an ice pick.

36
00:03:58,953 --> 00:03:59,986
Twice.

37
00:04:00,785 --> 00:04:03,567
It was the most disturbing shit
I've ever seen in my entire life,

38
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,936
and I have seen
some pretty disturbing shit.

39
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:08,839
He suffered, Lafayette.
Bad.

40
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,733
Okay, okay. I'm sorry, I...

41
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,090
I'll go and check in
on him in the mornin'.

42
00:04:13,497 --> 00:04:15,546
And I know he mean
a lot to you and everything,

43
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,382
but how is comin' up
in my joint at 3 a.m.

44
00:04:18,502 --> 00:04:21,340
throwin' my shit around
gonna make anything better?

45
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,392
It makes me feel better.

46
00:04:26,377 --> 00:04:27,145
Okay.

47
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:31,101
<i>Shame on you, Adele Stackhouse.</i>

48
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:33,130
- <i>Shame on you.</i>
- Who is this?

49
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,266
<i>A vampire is a perversion</i>
<i>of humanity.</i>

50
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:38,569
<i>And you, vampire lover, are perverting
our community by bringing one{\ into the open}.</i>

51
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:41,872
I suggest that you hear what he has
to say before you take to lynchin' him.

52
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:44,542
<i>I don't care what sort of wretches</i>
<i>you keep in your own home,</i>

53
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:47,807
<i>but when you bring freaks</i>
<i>and abominations into our churches</i>

54
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:49,647
<i>in front of our children,
you will...</i>

55
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:52,471
Well, I will be at the church early

56
00:04:52,873 --> 00:04:55,464
if you would like
to stop by and say hi.

57
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:57,903
Mr. Compton's talk starts at 8.

58
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:00,056
<i>You will go to hell for this.</i>

59
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:02,378
All right, same to you.
Bye, now.

60
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:06,481
Phone's been ringing
early today.

61
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:12,516
Everyone is excited about meeting
the town vampire tonight.

62
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,956
I didn't hear you come in last night.
You went to bed early.

63
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:20,043
You didn't want to hear me come in.

64
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:24,154
I just thought I would give you two
a little privacy is all.

65
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:26,183
Am I really that much
of a lost cause,

66
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:28,626
you gotta pin all your hopes
for me on a vampire?

67
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,588
But he seems like a very nice man.

68
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,834
- Well, he's not.
- He's not nice?

69
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:34,291
Or a man.

70
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:36,861
Oh, goodness,
did you two have a fight?

71
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,422
Kinda.

72
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:45,390
I don't think Bill and I
have very much in common.

73
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,934
He doesn't think like we do,
he doesn't feel the way we do,

74
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:50,894
if he feels at all.

75
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:58,049
Well, I know that if I had
a chance to know somebody

76
00:05:58,169 --> 00:05:59,945
who'd experienced
the world differently,

77
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:03,294
I'd see it as a blessing
and not something to be scared of.

78
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:05,366
Or hate.

79
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:06,957
I don't hate him.

80
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:08,747
I just don't want
to be his girlfriend.

81
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:15,137
The phone's ringin'.

82
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:17,487
Michelle will pick it up.

83
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:27,511
- Damn.
- Yeah. Just like that.

84
00:06:28,272 --> 00:06:29,768
And no anesthesia either.

85
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:32,854
First, I get hauled in
by the cops,

86
00:06:32,974 --> 00:06:35,966
then I gotta let
a dude drain my Johnston.

87
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:38,235
That's a fuck of the day.

88
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:39,742
Sounds like it.

89
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:47,264
You didn't tell nobody
where you get the V at, did you?

90
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:48,700
Do I look stupid?

91
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,388
I didn't even let on
I was takin' anything.

92
00:06:51,508 --> 00:06:53,571
- You're my dog.
- I love you right back.

93
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:56,418
But listen, you gotta stop
sellin' V, man.

94
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,175
It fucks people up.

95
00:06:58,295 --> 00:07:00,813
I mean, shit,
now Sheriff Dearborne thinks

96
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,884
I'm some kind
of sex maniac.

97
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:04,849
And hell if know how I'll ever,

98
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:06,951
ever be able to look
Tara in the face again.

99
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:08,306
Well, she'll get over it.

100
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:12,143
The girl's been lost in love
with you since she was 8.

101
00:07:13,882 --> 00:07:15,394
- No shit?
- No shit.

102
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:19,161
Oh, man.
That's even worse.

103
00:07:19,617 --> 00:07:20,939
I had no idea.

104
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:26,644
My life sucks so much ass.

105
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,837
And it's all because
of your fuckin' V.

106
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:32,426
Listen, don't blame the Ferrari
just 'cause your ass can't drive.

107
00:07:33,264 --> 00:07:35,926
You're gonna have to learn
how to ride the high, boyfriend.

108
00:07:36,046 --> 00:07:37,815
Fuck that,
I am done with V.

109
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:40,380
Go fuck some other people up
with that shit. You broke me.

110
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,547
No, man.

111
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:44,221
If you can learn to control it,

112
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:47,721
V will open up your mind
to everything you missin' around you.

113
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,613
That's what's gonna snap you
out of all this shit.

114
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:53,700
More V?

115
00:07:54,177 --> 00:07:55,562
If done right.

116
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:58,273
I got some in my car...

117
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:02,401
if you want me to show you.

118
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:13,918
Now, I ain't showin' you
no whole vial

119
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:16,624
till you learn
how to use this shit right.

120
00:08:16,874 --> 00:08:17,921
You get me?

121
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:23,801
This...

122
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,761
is the life force
of a vampire.

123
00:08:30,364 --> 00:08:32,874
They're just blood
in a skin casing.

124
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,635
Ain't a whole lot different between
a vampire and a boudin sausage except...

125
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,265
for the blood.

126
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:47,113
Our blood sustains life,
this blood...

127
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:50,618
is life.

128
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:52,409
One drop,

129
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:56,349
that's all you need.
Can't be greedy.

130
00:08:57,457 --> 00:08:59,960
Billions of molecules of pure,

131
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,838
undiluted, 24 karat life.

132
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:08,139
You take this in and you take in
a piece of the vampire it came from.

133
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:09,368
The trick is,

134
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,278
you have to let it take you deep.

135
00:09:12,663 --> 00:09:13,756
Follow it.

136
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:16,162
Soak it in.

137
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:31,230
What kind of vampire is that?

138
00:09:33,884 --> 00:09:35,120
He's new.

139
00:09:36,638 --> 00:09:38,706
So the blood
is still a little wild.

140
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:42,206
I can feel him in my muscles

141
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:43,841
making me strong.

142
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:50,478
But you might get
another side of him.

143
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:54,729
The same V could affect you
in a whole other way.

144
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:58,934
But I guarantee you'll see
the world with new eyes.

145
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:20,044
Christ, I can't believe
I'm doin' this again.

146
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:21,272
Oh, no, man.

147
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:24,135
You're doin' it
for the first time.

148
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,771
That vampire Bill would get
a rise out of that.

149
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:34,210
You'll have to ask him yourself.

150
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:38,596
Vamp club not all
it was made out to be, huh?

151
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:40,513
A lot of freaks,
I hear.

152
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:42,396
And people from Arkansas.

153
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:44,105
It was fine.

154
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:47,718
So what, then? Did that vampire
get all handsy with you?

155
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,994
I can take care of myself.
And,

156
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,711
I won't be goin' out with him again.

157
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:57,982
Okay, that place was kinda freaky,

158
00:10:58,102 --> 00:11:00,551
but how are you ever gonna know
until you go see for yourself.

159
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:02,021
I said my piece yesterday.

160
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:04,374
I'm sorry it didn't
turn out like you'd hoped,

161
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:07,753
but better it happens now
than before you end up hurt, or dead.

162
00:11:13,783 --> 00:11:15,363
I hope you're not too flipped out

163
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:17,668
to miss the Descendants
of the Glorious Dead tonight.

164
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:20,124
No, I gotta go.
Gran spent all week on it.

165
00:11:20,864 --> 00:11:22,089
Good, 'cause,

166
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,603
I was gonna ask
if you wanna go with me.

167
00:11:25,347 --> 00:11:27,919
Maybe we'll go grab a cup
of coffee or somethin' after.

168
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:33,363
Are you askin' me out?

169
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:37,436
Yeah, I am.
That's pretty much how I do it.

170
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:40,074
Sometimes they even say yes.

171
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:45,916
- Everyone's lookin' at us.
- I know, you better say yes.

172
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:51,425
Shoot.

173
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,107
Why not?

174
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:55,719
Good.

175
00:11:57,232 --> 00:11:59,009
Eyes back on your food, people.

176
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:06,984
Sorry about that.
They were all kind of watery.

177
00:12:07,104 --> 00:12:09,024
No sweat.
Love is in the air, huh?

178
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,320
- I guess.
- Even that brother of yours.

179
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:16,072
He gettin' serious with Tara?

180
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,614
Tara who?

181
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:24,371
- I thought you knew.
- If there was any truth to it, I would.

182
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:26,260
<i>There you go, right there.
I knew it.</i>

183
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,986
<i>Tara ain't bangin' Stackhouse.</i>
<i>Bitch lied to me.</i>

184
00:12:29,106 --> 00:12:31,684
- Watch your mouth, Andy Bellefleur.
- Didn't say anything.

185
00:12:31,804 --> 00:12:34,256
<i>I know I didn't say anything,</i>
<i>but I did think it.</i>

186
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:37,782
<i>And you heard it, that means it's true.</i>
<i>You can hear what people think.</i>

187
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:39,903
Let me get you a refill
on that tea.

188
00:12:43,617 --> 00:12:45,217
I need a sweet tea.

189
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:46,957
Tara here yet?

190
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:49,312
She just came in.
She's in the ladies' room.

191
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,966
Why didn't you tell me
you were goin' out with Sam?

192
00:12:56,086 --> 00:12:59,003
Because it just happened.
And how did you know?

193
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:00,990
Arlene, she works fast.

194
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:04,038
Alls he did was ask me
to the DGD tonight.

195
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:06,110
It's in a church
for cryin' out loud.

196
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:09,749
And why shouldn't I? He's perfectly
nice, and he's got a good job,

197
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:13,005
and he's not a vampire, and...
Why do I have to justify?

198
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,638
I'm entitled to know
what my girl's up to, ain't I?

199
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:17,350
Yeah, about that.

200
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:20,996
Why does Andy Bellefleur think
you're seein' my brother?

201
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:25,057
I went down to the sheriff's
and gave Jason an alibi.

202
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:26,504
What'd you do that for?

203
00:13:26,624 --> 00:13:28,435
Because I know he's innocent
and so do you.

204
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:30,748
And we both know the more time
he spends with the police

205
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:33,011
the more he's gonna talk
himself into trouble.

206
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:37,175
Is there something' else
you're not tellin' me?

207
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:44,787
What are you doing?

208
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:48,040
Not every detail of everyone's
personal life is your business, okay?

209
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:53,243
Keep that girl away from me.

210
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,009
Is everything okay?

211
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:05,048
Hey, you know,
now that I think of it,

212
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:08,639
my brother and Tara have kind
of been sneakin' around lately.

213
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,162
It's a shame they feel
they gotta keep it quiet.

214
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,911
<i>She must think I'm an idiot,
like I don't know now</i>

215
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:17,236
<i>she's coverin' for him too.</i>
<i>Shit, don't look her in the eye.</i>

216
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:19,517
If you're gonna accuse me of lyin',

217
00:14:19,637 --> 00:14:22,249
be a man and say it
out loud, for Pete's sake.

218
00:14:22,602 --> 00:14:25,744
Either way, I'm gonna hear you
whether you look me in the eye or not.

219
00:14:25,946 --> 00:14:28,826
Let's face it, there's not
a whole lot of ideas in there.

220
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:30,249
Like mice in a cage.

221
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:32,293
I know you're graspin' at straws,

222
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:34,784
but don't drag
my brother down with you.

223
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:45,204
Here you go.

224
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:54,352
Momma, what are you doin'?

225
00:14:54,472 --> 00:14:58,110
- Help Momma get this thing down.
- Get it...?

226
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:01,697
Our guest of honor is a vampire.

227
00:15:02,113 --> 00:15:05,848
Adele Plumb forgot that little fact
when she booked the church for tonight.

228
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:09,724
What do you think's gonna happen
when he comes out and sees a giant cross?

229
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:11,898
- I don't know.
- Well, I don't either.

230
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:14,815
But if he sizzles up like fatback bacon
in front of everybody,

231
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:17,254
there's not gonna be much
of a meetin', now, is there?

232
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:19,619
Now come on,
make yourself useful.

233
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:21,894
Quit jerkin' on it.

234
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,787
Hi, there, munchkins.

235
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:26,353
I reckon you're
the youngest history buffs

236
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:28,432
we've had at the DGD.

237
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:31,318
Yeah, well, they wouldn't
stay home for nothin'.

238
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:34,210
The minute they heard
a vampire, they had to come.

239
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:38,729
Well, hello there, Mayor Norris

240
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,231
Evening, Adele.

241
00:15:40,351 --> 00:15:41,926
Quite a turn out.
Isn't it?

242
00:15:42,046 --> 00:15:44,240
Good thing Myra made
extra ambrosia.

243
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:47,618
Andy Bellefleur will like that.
He's with the Dearbornes.

244
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:51,475
Look, Lord know why Bud insisted
on wearing his uniform.

245
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:54,247
Is our vampire friend here?

246
00:15:54,618 --> 00:15:56,089
In the kitchen waitin'.

247
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:59,625
<i>I left him with a bottle</i>
<i>of that Tru Blood they like.</i>

248
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:04,757
Do you think we've taken
enough precautions?

249
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:06,556
Against what?

250
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:09,223
Well, to make sure
everybody's safe.

251
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:13,101
Ordinarily I wouldn't pay no mind,

252
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,479
but there's young folks here.

253
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:18,676
Sterling, we don't have
anything to be frightened of,

254
00:16:18,796 --> 00:16:21,902
Mr. Compton is a perfect gentleman.

255
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,143
Frankly I am more worried
about what we might do to him.

256
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:35,507
Momma,

257
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:39,052
this ain't gonna budge
without a jackhammer or a blowtorch.

258
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:41,826
Get down from there,
I got a better idea.

259
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,426
- Gran, look at all the people.
- Isn't it exciting?

260
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:48,471
Well, Sam Merlotte,
what a nice surprise.

261
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:50,723
<i>When She told me
she was comin' here alone</i>

262
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,265
<i>I thought it would be a shame
if she came without an escort.</i>

263
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:58,120
<i>- How very gentlemanly of you.
- Okay, we're sittin' down now.</i>

264
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:09,592
Hey, girl.

265
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,107
Can we join you?

266
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:13,691
Hi, Tara.

267
00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:15,177
Sure, come on in.

268
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,347
Could always use
more white people.

269
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:32,643
<i>If you can learn to control it,
V will open up your mind</i>

270
00:17:32,763 --> 00:17:34,600
<i>to everything
you missin' around you.</i>

271
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:45,790
<i>There's nothing
but old people.</i>

272
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,981
Man, I thought we were here
for a vampire, not zombies.

273
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:52,081
Yeah, more like descendants
of the walking dead.

274
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,222
You assholes didn't leave
the shit in the pick 'em up, did you?

275
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:38,581
Mind if I sit with you?

276
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,509
Sure, have a seat.

277
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,264
Hey, guys.

278
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:48,548
- How you feelin'?
- Oh, strong.

279
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:51,662
Alive.

280
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,218
Hey, sit back.

281
00:18:57,782 --> 00:18:59,158
It's okay, relax.

282
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:00,936
I thought I was relaxed.

283
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:03,219
I don't think you know how.

284
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,487
Welcome.

285
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:13,044
It certainly is a pleasure

286
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:16,202
to see so many new faces
here this month.

287
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:21,485
But Mayor Norris assures me
that there will be enough ambrosia

288
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:23,584
and tipsy cake for everyone.

289
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:26,291
Now,

290
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:30,728
our guest tonight
is a gentleman who,

291
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:34,428
despite what you might
have heard, is one of us.

292
00:19:34,662 --> 00:19:38,369
His family was among
the first to settle in Bon Temps

293
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:40,912
and he bravely fought for Louisiana,

294
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:43,437
in the war
for Southern independence.

295
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:48,579
Let us welcome one of the original
sons of Bon Temps back to the town

296
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:50,928
that he helped build.

297
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,816
I give you First Lieutenant,

298
00:19:55,788 --> 00:19:58,241
William Thomas Compton.

299
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:10,640
Thank you, Mrs. Stackhouse.

300
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:13,183
If you'll pardon me
for a moment.

301
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,266
As a patriot of this great nation,

302
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:36,824
I wouldn't dream of putting
myself before Old Glory.

303
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,638
As you can see,
I did not burst into flames.

304
00:20:49,463 --> 00:20:51,836
We vampires are not
minions of the devil.

305
00:20:53,658 --> 00:20:55,446
We can stand before a cross,

306
00:20:56,044 --> 00:20:57,214
or a bible,

307
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:58,816
or in a church,

308
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:01,223
just as readily
as any other creature of God.

309
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,887
How was I supposed to know?

310
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:05,205
I am honored to stand
before you tonight.

311
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:08,473
Vampires have traditionally
been very private,

312
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:11,244
perhaps to our detriment.

313
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,650
But I believe,
if we reach out to one another,

314
00:21:15,352 --> 00:21:16,973
that we can coexist,

315
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,479
and even thrive together.

316
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:27,713
I served in the 28th Louisiana infantry.

317
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:31,046
Formed in Monroe in 1862,

318
00:21:31,602 --> 00:21:33,172
under Colonel Henry Gray.

319
00:21:33,373 --> 00:21:36,544
It was there that we learned
the value of human life,

320
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:40,012
and the ease with which
it can be extinguished.

321
00:21:40,244 --> 00:21:43,647
That son of buck's been
killin' since the 1860s.

322
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:47,066
- Why stop now?
- That don't prove anything.

323
00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:50,773
My cousin Terry killed
20 Iraqis in Fallujah.

324
00:21:50,974 --> 00:21:52,536
You sayin' we should lock him up?

325
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:55,106
Your cousin Terry
should be locked up.

326
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:58,376
Uneducated as we were,
we knew little of the political

327
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:01,867
or ideological conflicts
that had lead to this point.

328
00:22:02,427 --> 00:22:04,789
Momma, he's so white.

329
00:22:05,202 --> 00:22:08,134
No, darlin', we're white.
He's dead.

330
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,491
...but goin' to war
was not a choice for us.

331
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:16,939
We believed to a man,

332
00:22:17,657 --> 00:22:19,630
that we had a calling to fulfill.

333
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:23,574
A destiny handed down
to us from above.

334
00:22:25,263 --> 00:22:28,649
God forbid should any of our men
become wounded or injured.

335
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:32,343
Often the only recourse
for a serious injury

336
00:22:32,463 --> 00:22:33,608
was amputation.

337
00:22:33,898 --> 00:22:36,485
More times than I care
to remember, I had to hold down

338
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,238
one of my fellow soldiers
while the medic took

339
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:40,653
a saw to his arm or leg.

340
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:43,732
We had no anesthesia at the time.
Apart from a bit of whiskey.

341
00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:44,727
Load it up.

342
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:46,826
It often seemed that the man
bein' operated upon

343
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:50,428
suffered more from his surgery
than he did from his original wound.

344
00:22:50,548 --> 00:22:52,930
Even if he survived
the amputation,

345
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,066
the chance of subsequent
infection was high.

346
00:22:55,186 --> 00:22:56,255
Fucker.

347
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:58,466
<i>Keep it down.</i>

348
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:04,972
In the winter months,
the nights could grow bitter cold.

349
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,457
My great grandfather
was in the 28th.

350
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:47,718
I wonder if you might
have known him.

351
00:23:47,838 --> 00:23:50,016
His name was
Tolliver Humphries.

352
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:52,123
Tolliver Humphries?

353
00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:55,566
I knew him very well.

354
00:23:56,383 --> 00:23:57,692
We fought together.

355
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,068
Tolliver Humphries
was my friend.

356
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:03,091
He was a brave man,
perhaps to a fault.

357
00:24:03,793 --> 00:24:06,116
I dare say it contributed
to his death.

358
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:07,743
What happened?

359
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,980
- Were you there?
- I was.

360
00:24:11,262 --> 00:24:14,645
<i>We were about 20 miles north</i>
<i>of where I stand now.</i>

361
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:18,049
<i>The Federals outnumbered us</i>
<i>5-to-1,</i>

362
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:20,484
<i>and they had better</i>
<i>firepower as well.</i>

363
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:23,593
<i>We'd spent much of the afternoon</i>
<i>recovering the bodies of those we'd lost.</i>

364
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:25,440
Help me, please!

365
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,291
<i>There was a boy</i>
<i>in our troupe...</i>

366
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:29,393
<i>No more than 13 or 14.</i>

367
00:24:29,513 --> 00:24:32,353
<i>Who lay wounded in the middle</i>
<i>of a field under poor cover.</i>

368
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:34,799
<i>He called to us all day.</i>

369
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,534
<i>He begged us to help him.</i>

370
00:24:36,654 --> 00:24:38,615
<i>He knew he would die</i>
<i>if we didn't.</i>

371
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:40,871
<i>I admit I considered</i>
<i>shootin' the boy myself</i>

372
00:24:40,991 --> 00:24:42,273
<i>just to shut him up.</i>

373
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:45,881
<i>But Tolliver convinced me</i>
<i>that would be an act of murder, not war.</i>

374
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:47,062
Hold your fire!

375
00:24:48,193 --> 00:24:50,379
<i>He told me God wanted him</i>
<i>to rescue that boy.</i>

376
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:51,482
I'll go get him.

377
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:53,498
<i>I pleaded with him not to go.</i>

378
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:55,554
<i>To think of his wife</i>
<i>and children back home.</i>

379
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:58,692
<i>He ran into that field</i>
<i>like it was a cool spring day.</i>

380
00:24:58,812 --> 00:24:59,717
Please!

381
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:06,116
<i>They shot him</i>
<i>just as he reached the boy.</i>

382
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,347
<i>It was obvious to us</i>
<i>that he was beyond help.</i>

383
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,899
<i>And then,</i>
<i>after a while,</i>

384
00:25:15,468 --> 00:25:17,141
<i>the boy started screamin' again.</i>

385
00:25:26,403 --> 00:25:28,122
What happened
to the boy?

386
00:25:29,232 --> 00:25:30,283
He lived.

387
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:34,487
He survived the day,

388
00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:37,375
and then under cover
of darkness

389
00:25:37,748 --> 00:25:39,636
we retrieved him
later that night,

390
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:42,563
along with the body
of Tolliver Humphries.

391
00:25:45,322 --> 00:25:47,540
But it seems
that Tolliver was right.

392
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,335
God did look after
his descendants.

393
00:25:57,447 --> 00:25:58,606
Mayor Norris.

394
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:02,932
I've been digging
in the archives this week...

395
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:07,610
and I found this old tintype.

396
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:10,450
The inscription
on the back says,

397
00:26:10,815 --> 00:26:12,726
"Mr. W.T. Compton"

398
00:26:13,624 --> 00:26:14,838
"and family."

399
00:26:15,235 --> 00:26:18,118
Can you tell us
if this is a picture of you?

400
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:33,773
This...

401
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:36,721
This is a remarkable photograph.

402
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:41,313
I remember the day we gathered
to have this taken.

403
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:44,609
When was the last time
you were with them?

404
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:49,954
When I went to war in 1862.

405
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:53,768
I...

406
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,290
My human life ended before I had
a chance to come back home.

407
00:27:03,085 --> 00:27:04,715
But you became a...

408
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:06,616
A vampire after that, right?

409
00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:09,770
Couldn't you go back
to your family then?

410
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:18,495
No, that wouldn't
have been possible.

411
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:24,895
I apologize.

412
00:27:25,595 --> 00:27:28,361
This is not a subject I'm very
comfortable speaking about.

413
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,032
But thank you
for the photograph, mayor.

414
00:27:34,298 --> 00:27:36,035
Brings back many memories for me.

415
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,501
Any other questions?

416
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,570
Thanks for coming, dear.

417
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,672
They don't understand, man.

418
00:28:03,294 --> 00:28:05,314
None of them
will ever understand.

419
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:08,145
You stay sharp, brother.

420
00:28:08,452 --> 00:28:09,490
All right.

421
00:28:13,031 --> 00:28:14,090
Could I...?

422
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:16,954
Would it be possible
to take a picture with you?

423
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:18,389
Of course.

424
00:28:18,678 --> 00:28:20,496
You won't vanish in the photo?

425
00:28:20,728 --> 00:28:23,731
That's just a myth. And it's one
I'd be happy to disprove.

426
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:28,007
Come around.

427
00:28:34,778 --> 00:28:35,970
All right.

428
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,069
- Here you are.
- Thanks so much.

429
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:44,686
- Great job tonight.
- Wasn't he just marvelous?

430
00:28:45,128 --> 00:28:47,440
Yeah, that was...
That was quite a show.

431
00:28:48,113 --> 00:28:50,087
Billy, you remember Sam,
right?

432
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:52,104
Yes, you're Sookie's employer.

433
00:28:52,777 --> 00:28:55,854
- Not when we're off-duty.
- No, legally you still are.

434
00:28:57,579 --> 00:28:59,963
Well, I just wanted
to congratulate you.

435
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,914
Seems like you've won
everybody over.

436
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:05,616
Well, some, I hope.

437
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,562
Well, we better get going.

438
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,216
We're gonna grab a cup of coffee
before we call it a night.

439
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:14,516
Coffee.

440
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:16,719
Sounds delightful.

441
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,260
Good night, Gran.
I'll see ya later.

442
00:29:24,442 --> 00:29:25,851
He seems nice.

443
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:42,479
Man,

444
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:44,372
this place is crawling
with hot chicks

445
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:46,844
and we're just sitting here like
our balls are stuck together.

446
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:49,252
Don't look at me.
My <i>chère</i> is right there.

447
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,430
You want a girl so bad,
you get one yourself. You...

448
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:54,318
Want another round?

449
00:29:55,973 --> 00:29:58,817
Maybe we should order up
a couple of those Tru Blood's.

450
00:30:00,963 --> 00:30:03,386
After meeting at vampire tonight,
don't you wanna try it

451
00:30:03,506 --> 00:30:04,799
and see what it's like?

452
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:07,141
I go to the dog races.
You see me eating Alpo?

453
00:30:08,478 --> 00:30:11,167
I just thought
he was pretty cool, was all.

454
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,397
Another Dixie Draft?

455
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:27,699
Dixie Draft.

456
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:29,439
Yup, I'll get it.

457
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:31,856
I love you guys.

458
00:30:31,976 --> 00:30:32,795
I know.

459
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:37,232
Another Dixie Draft?

460
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:42,357
You feel that?

461
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:47,384
Every hair on your arm
shooting sparks into my hand.

462
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:51,091
You know those electric fences
they use to pen horses?

463
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:54,067
It feels like
I just pissed on one.

464
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:56,900
Oh, my God, you are still high.
I'm gonna kill Lafayette.

465
00:30:57,234 --> 00:30:58,416
No, don't.

466
00:30:58,968 --> 00:31:00,138
I'm not high.

467
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,535
Okay, I am high. But that don't mean
that what I'm feeling ain't real.

468
00:31:04,735 --> 00:31:06,600
For the first time,
I can see clear.

469
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,167
All these years, I was blinded
by the bullshit that keeps people apart.

470
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:12,605
It's you, Tara.

471
00:31:14,154 --> 00:31:16,998
- It's been you all along.
- Who you think you're talking to?

472
00:31:17,118 --> 00:31:18,936
I've known you
since I was 6 years old.

473
00:31:19,056 --> 00:31:21,357
And it's taken me
all this time to admit it.

474
00:31:25,296 --> 00:31:26,419
Come here.

475
00:31:27,622 --> 00:31:29,559
This bar might be full

476
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:31,254
with beautiful women,

477
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:34,133
but you're the one who took care
of me when I needed it.

478
00:31:34,253 --> 00:31:35,685
You showed me love, Tara.

479
00:31:35,805 --> 00:31:37,992
And that's the most beautiful
thing of all.

480
00:31:40,897 --> 00:31:42,490
Come to me when you're sober.

481
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:44,659
Then we can talk serious.

482
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:52,959
Just give me a chance,
I'll prove it to you.

483
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,903
Everything I'm feeling

484
00:31:58,988 --> 00:32:00,655
I want to feel it with you.

485
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:02,830
One chance.

486
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,229
That's all I'm asking.

487
00:32:14,972 --> 00:32:16,503
Last bite's yours.

488
00:32:16,623 --> 00:32:17,848
No, you go ahead.

489
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,337
Here, we'll split it.

490
00:32:22,953 --> 00:32:24,861
Well, I guess you saw this
comin', huh?

491
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:28,042
What? Tonight?

492
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,961
What makes you say that?

493
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:32,789
Well, I said you could listen in,

494
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,211
hear what I'm thinking if you
wanted. You ever tried?

495
00:32:35,331 --> 00:32:37,787
No, I have, and to be honest,

496
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,684
it's a little weird.

497
00:32:39,984 --> 00:32:41,799
You don't think
the way others do.

498
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:45,845
Most people, it's whole
sentences or images.

499
00:32:46,143 --> 00:32:48,274
With you, sometimes
there's words,

500
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,924
but other times,
I just get these sounds.

501
00:32:51,564 --> 00:32:53,604
Like, waves of emotions.

502
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:56,808
- I guess I'm just a freak.
- I was gonna say mysterious.

503
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:03,743
How come nobody knows anything
about you?

504
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:06,502
I never hear you talk about
where you're from, or

505
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,579
your family, or anything.

506
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:12,573
Place I'm from, the people who raised me
got nothing to do with who I am.

507
00:33:13,418 --> 00:33:15,332
And I ended up pretty much
raising myself.

508
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:17,331
Is that why you spend
so much time alone?

509
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:19,959
I think that's {\just}
'cause I don't like people.

510
00:33:20,283 --> 00:33:23,757
Come on, no one goes and opens a bar
if they don't like people.

511
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,635
Maybe I wanted to meet
some pretty waitresses.

512
00:33:29,953 --> 00:33:33,100
Too bad you got yourself a couple
of crazy ones in the bargain.

513
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:37,521
There's nothing wrong
with you.

514
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:42,580
I can't understand why you'd wanna fix
or change or hide anything.

515
00:33:43,284 --> 00:33:45,315
I wouldn't want you
any other way.

516
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,033
You're just trying
to get on my good side.

517
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,094
How am I doing?

518
00:33:54,752 --> 00:33:55,797
Finish it.

519
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,658
That's yours.

520
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,581
- Is there a problem with my burger?
- Just a couple of drunk rednecks,

521
00:34:15,701 --> 00:34:16,898
that's all.

522
00:34:17,394 --> 00:34:18,729
What's their problem?

523
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,413
Oh, come on, now.
It's not worth it.

524
00:34:24,755 --> 00:34:26,112
What did they say?

525
00:34:26,376 --> 00:34:27,362
He said

526
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:30,115
- the burger...
- What did they say, Arlene?

527
00:34:30,316 --> 00:34:32,494
He said the burger
might have AIDS.

528
00:34:42,673 --> 00:34:45,069
Oh, fudge.

529
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:53,409
Excuse me.

530
00:34:53,996 --> 00:34:55,745
Who ordered the hamburger

531
00:34:56,951 --> 00:34:58,005
with AIDS?

532
00:35:03,015 --> 00:35:05,068
I ordered the hamburger deluxe.

533
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:07,731
In this restaurant,
a hamburger deluxe

534
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:10,583
come with french fries,
lettuce, tomato, mayo,

535
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:12,044
and AIDS!

536
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:14,910
Do anybody got a problem with that?

537
00:35:16,932 --> 00:35:18,155
I'm an American.

538
00:35:18,275 --> 00:35:20,124
And I got a say
in who makes my food.

539
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:21,989
Baby, it's too late for that.

540
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:25,535
Faggots been breeding your cows, raising
your chicken, even brewing your beer

541
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:28,168
long before I walked my sexy ass
up in this motherfucker.

542
00:35:28,288 --> 00:35:31,426
Everything on your goddamn table
got AIDS.

543
00:35:33,003 --> 00:35:35,264
You still ain't makin' me eat
no AIDS burger.

544
00:35:37,071 --> 00:35:40,123
Well, all you gotta do is say
"hold the AIDS."

545
00:35:40,886 --> 00:35:41,697
Here.

546
00:35:42,994 --> 00:35:43,994
Eat it.

547
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,978
Bitch, you come in my house, you gonna
eat my food the way I fucking make it!

548
00:35:52,502 --> 00:35:53,782
Do you understand me?

549
00:35:57,903 --> 00:35:59,270
Tip your waitress.

550
00:36:13,482 --> 00:36:15,699
I for one am thankful
you can't hear all my thoughts.

551
00:36:15,819 --> 00:36:18,807
- Why's that?
- 'Cause then you'd know what's comin'.

552
00:36:29,018 --> 00:36:30,946
You okay?
Are we going too fast?

553
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,151
- Maybe.
- I don't wanna make you do anything

554
00:36:36,271 --> 00:36:38,172
- you don't want to do.
- No, I do,

555
00:36:38,402 --> 00:36:39,924
I do, I do. Trust me.

556
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:42,302
I want to.

557
00:36:43,282 --> 00:36:44,250
It's just

558
00:36:44,673 --> 00:36:48,336
kind of... too much right now,
and a little too soon since...

559
00:36:50,331 --> 00:36:51,340
Since what?

560
00:36:54,321 --> 00:36:57,478
- Oh, goddamn it, Sookie.
- I'm sorry.

561
00:36:57,994 --> 00:36:59,521
I'm not used to this.

562
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:01,746
Should never have gone
to see that damn vampire.

563
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:04,113
It's not him. Just stop it.

564
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:08,561
I just can't go jumping from kissing
one man to the next so quickly.

565
00:37:08,815 --> 00:37:10,898
- You kissed him?
- That's none of your business.

566
00:37:11,432 --> 00:37:14,383
- What else did you do?
- That's really none of your business.

567
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:17,093
Is this a contest for you?
Whatever he did, you have to top it?

568
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:19,349
- Come on, be fair.
- You know what's unfair,

569
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:22,326
is you waiting for someone else shows an
interest before you decide to kiss me.

570
00:37:22,488 --> 00:37:24,869
You have no future
with a vampire.

571
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:27,289
They don't die. I've got nothing
but a future with one.

572
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:29,897
Just like Dawn had a future?
Like Maudette Pickens had a future?

573
00:37:30,017 --> 00:37:31,664
Bill did not kill those women.

574
00:37:31,784 --> 00:37:35,009
{\Listen,}There's nothing that I will not do
to keep that thing from hurting you.

575
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:37,632
They're not like us.
They could turn on you.

576
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:39,975
And people can't?

577
00:37:40,597 --> 00:37:42,628
You're doing pretty good right now.

578
00:37:47,624 --> 00:37:49,913
All right,
I think I best take you home.

579
00:37:50,765 --> 00:37:51,893
You go ahead.

580
00:37:52,718 --> 00:37:54,903
- I'll call a cab.
- For crying out loud, don't be

581
00:37:55,104 --> 00:37:56,788
stupid, Sookie. Get in.

582
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:12,294
Excuse me.

583
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,077
Whip! Whip!

584
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:30,022
What you doing, baby?

585
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:32,827
You know, keeping it real.

586
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:35,199
- Partyin'.
- Me too.

587
00:38:35,669 --> 00:38:37,488
I'm celebratin'.

588
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:42,498
- What's the occasion?
- My divorce went through today.

589
00:38:45,762 --> 00:38:47,082
That's great.

590
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:48,355
He was a jerk.

591
00:38:48,635 --> 00:38:49,750
He shot my car.

592
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:53,420
- Sorry to hear that.
- Yeah?

593
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:55,635
It's like watching
<i>Animal Planet</i>, yeah?

594
00:38:55,976 --> 00:38:58,510
Any second, she gonna bite
his head off, I swear.

595
00:39:01,418 --> 00:39:02,428
So...

596
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,392
you wanna help me
forget all about him?

597
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,593
She asked me
to come home with her.

598
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:15,442
- So, what are you doing here, you?
- I said I'd think about it.

599
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:18,612
Yeah, you a lost cause.

600
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,116
What? I just didn't feel that...
that spark.

601
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,911
Another Dixie Draft.

602
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,206
Tru Blood, O-negative.

603
00:39:28,588 --> 00:39:30,083
No refunds on that, Hoyt.

604
00:39:30,864 --> 00:39:32,084
It's... It's hot.

605
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:35,751
That's the way it's served: 98.6.

606
00:39:45,305 --> 00:39:46,747
That shit is nasty.

607
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:49,226
Yeah, what'd you expect?
This bullshit is like blood.

608
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,825
I thought it was supposed to be
some sort of life-force or something.

609
00:39:52,945 --> 00:39:54,353
Tru Blood don't do nothing.

610
00:39:54,781 --> 00:39:56,901
The real life-force... is V.

611
00:39:58,766 --> 00:40:00,764
Vampire blood. It's illegal.

612
00:40:00,884 --> 00:40:03,454
All our blood
belongs to the universe.

613
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:06,964
They take some from us,
we take a little from them.

614
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:09,372
I just say no to drugs, <i>merci.</i>

615
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:12,042
It might give you the will
to seal the deal with that girl.

616
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,884
Only thing holding you back,

617
00:40:15,477 --> 00:40:16,487
is you.

618
00:40:27,982 --> 00:40:29,849
Ah, shit.

619
00:40:41,729 --> 00:40:42,729
Look.

620
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,192
What do you see, son?

621
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:49,662
Mr. Compton?
I'm Bud Dearborne.

622
00:40:50,362 --> 00:40:52,111
Sheriff of Renard Parish.

623
00:40:52,346 --> 00:40:54,589
This here's Detective
Andy Bellefleur.

624
00:40:59,851 --> 00:41:01,378
What can I do
for you gentlemen?

625
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,776
We'd like to ask you a few questions
pertaining to an investigation,

626
00:41:05,144 --> 00:41:06,906
- if you don't mind.
- Of course.

627
00:41:07,324 --> 00:41:08,816
Won't you come on in?

628
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:12,414
In to the house?

629
00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:22,799
Please,

630
00:41:23,174 --> 00:41:24,724
make yourselves at home.

631
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:31,644
May I offer you a drink?

632
00:41:33,017 --> 00:41:34,957
- No, thank you.
- I have Frescas.

633
00:41:35,386 --> 00:41:36,292
You do?

634
00:41:36,492 --> 00:41:37,542
For guests.

635
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:39,483
Well, I'll have a Fresca.

636
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:47,291
- What the hell are you doing?
- He offered.

637
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:48,531
He's a suspect.

638
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:50,931
Maybe to you.
We got no evidence.

639
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,807
He's a vampire.

640
00:42:13,944 --> 00:42:15,153
It's a toaster.

641
00:42:15,475 --> 00:42:16,475
For bread.

642
00:42:16,698 --> 00:42:19,206
You put the slices in the end
and then you cook them over the hearth.

643
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:23,715
I don't use it anymore,
as I no longer eat.

644
00:42:31,338 --> 00:42:33,367
You said you had
some questions for me.

645
00:42:34,106 --> 00:42:37,064
We're investigating a couple
of homicides that took place locally

646
00:42:37,184 --> 00:42:39,048
- in the past week.
- I've heard.

647
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:41,061
We're you familiar
with either of the victims?

648
00:42:41,463 --> 00:42:43,412
Maudette Pickens or Dawn Green?

649
00:42:43,682 --> 00:42:45,000
Miss Pickens, no,

650
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:46,707
but Miss Green,

651
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:49,823
I believe she worked
over at Sam Merlotte's place.

652
00:42:50,387 --> 00:42:52,035
We never spoke, but I saw her.

653
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,128
Were you aware that both had
sexual contact with vampires?

654
00:42:56,551 --> 00:42:57,457
I was not.

655
00:42:57,905 --> 00:43:00,167
But it's more common
than you would think.

656
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:04,893
You have anybody that can vouch
for your whereabouts

657
00:43:05,013 --> 00:43:07,796
on the night of the 23rd and 27th?

658
00:43:08,907 --> 00:43:10,214
Tell me sheriff,

659
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,218
were either of these
unfortunate women

660
00:43:13,338 --> 00:43:15,391
exsanguinated when you found them?

661
00:43:17,479 --> 00:43:19,006
Drained of their blood?

662
00:43:20,124 --> 00:43:21,850
If you don't mind my asking.

663
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,068
That's not information
we're at liberty to share.

664
00:43:27,995 --> 00:43:29,697
Because a fresh corpse...

665
00:43:31,703 --> 00:43:32,947
full of blood...

666
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:38,614
Detective, that's something
no vampire could resist.

667
00:43:39,737 --> 00:43:41,358
I dare say, not even I.

668
00:43:42,972 --> 00:43:44,615
Goof thing you weren't there.

669
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:46,548
And nor was any other vampire.

670
00:43:47,456 --> 00:43:50,681
A vampire would have drained
those girls of every last drop.

671
00:43:52,135 --> 00:43:53,262
How's your Fresca?

672
00:43:55,993 --> 00:43:57,308
It's a little warm.

673
00:43:57,515 --> 00:43:58,616
I apologize.

674
00:43:59,378 --> 00:44:00,766
I don't own a refrigerator.

675
00:44:04,938 --> 00:44:06,902
Oh, shoot.
I think I forgot my pen.

676
00:44:07,205 --> 00:44:08,215
Leave it.

677
00:44:53,468 --> 00:44:54,862
Is there anyone inside?

678
00:44:56,705 --> 00:44:57,926
I require help.

679
00:45:00,756 --> 00:45:03,456
I'm a soldier of the 28th
Louisiana Infantry.

680
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,627
I require food and water.

681
00:45:07,596 --> 00:45:09,522
Is there anyone who can help me?

682
00:45:25,302 --> 00:45:26,402
Do not move.

683
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,105
I will shoot you.

684
00:45:31,568 --> 00:45:34,530
I wasn't... even aware
we surrendered.

685
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,003
Word came two weeks ago.

686
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:39,779
Yeah. We disbanded immediately.

687
00:45:39,899 --> 00:45:42,158
Most of the men
marched back to Monroe,

688
00:45:42,475 --> 00:45:44,580
but I chose to take
a shortcut home by...

689
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,226
By way of these trails.

690
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:49,104
I overestimated my knowledge
of the land.

691
00:45:50,472 --> 00:45:51,810
You're not far off.

692
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:56,883
A lake is 10 miles
southwest of here,

693
00:45:57,336 --> 00:45:59,721
Bon Temps is 10 miles south of that.

694
00:46:05,711 --> 00:46:07,871
My husband was
in the 13th Infantry,

695
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:09,750
under Colonel Gibson.

696
00:46:10,857 --> 00:46:12,254
He fought at Shiloh.

697
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:17,259
He used to write to me
every few weeks,

698
00:46:17,379 --> 00:46:20,197
but I haven't heard from him
in nearly seven months.

699
00:46:23,299 --> 00:46:25,941
Many of the postal routes
have been disrupted.

700
00:46:26,902 --> 00:46:28,835
I'm sure your letter
simply got lost.

701
00:46:29,403 --> 00:46:30,742
That's kind of you.

702
00:46:31,672 --> 00:46:34,525
But I've considered myself
a widow for some time now.

703
00:46:41,537 --> 00:46:42,545
Still have

704
00:46:43,286 --> 00:46:45,815
quite a lot of blood on you.

705
00:46:56,842 --> 00:46:58,697
You're a lucky man, lieutenant.

706
00:46:59,988 --> 00:47:03,077
I doubt you would've survived
another day without food.

707
00:47:05,076 --> 00:47:07,413
I'm in debt to you
for taking pity on me.

708
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:11,200
I think,

709
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:13,959
for your sake,

710
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:18,804
you best spend the night here...

711
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:21,701
with me.

712
00:47:25,245 --> 00:47:26,142
I'm sorry.

713
00:47:28,751 --> 00:47:30,642
I apologize if I misled you,

714
00:47:34,029 --> 00:47:36,819
but I have a wife and two
small children waiting for me.

715
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,747
And if Bon Temps is as close
as you say it is,

716
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:43,685
then I'll see them soon,
and I do not wish to sully our reunion.

717
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,590
You are an honorable man.

718
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,495
The others have not always been so.

719
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:52,251
There's been others?

720
00:47:53,302 --> 00:47:54,605
From time to time.

721
00:47:55,383 --> 00:47:56,980
Deserters, mostly.

722
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:01,500
I offered them a crust of bread
and a place to rest,

723
00:48:03,142 --> 00:48:04,926
and they help appease
my loneliness.

724
00:48:06,654 --> 00:48:08,556
It may not be moral, lieutenant,

725
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:11,599
but these are times of war.

726
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:20,351
I do not judge you.

727
00:48:21,373 --> 00:48:23,282
Your choices are your own,
as are mine.

728
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:28,537
I wish to continue
on my way home.

729
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:33,120
You have my gratitude
for your hospitality.

730
00:48:33,658 --> 00:48:35,258
I will not soon forget it.

731
00:49:35,341 --> 00:49:36,504
The others.

732
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:41,641
They all presented themselves
as gentlemen.

733
00:49:43,053 --> 00:49:44,920
Can blame the war if you like.

734
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:47,825
They proved to be no more
than savages

735
00:49:47,987 --> 00:49:49,787
once I let them into my home.

736
00:49:51,165 --> 00:49:52,833
They deserve no better.

737
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:01,522
Have they died?

738
00:50:02,655 --> 00:50:03,770
Oh, yes.

739
00:50:07,127 --> 00:50:09,389
But I'm not keen to let you go
quite so easily.

740
00:50:09,971 --> 00:50:12,742
I've waited a long time
for a man such as you.

741
00:50:17,588 --> 00:50:18,598
Drink.

742
00:50:21,478 --> 00:50:23,948
If you do not drink,
you will die.

743
00:50:24,237 --> 00:50:26,322
Certain as I'm speaking
to you right now.

744
00:50:27,064 --> 00:50:29,518
Do you wish
to see your family again?

745
00:50:30,229 --> 00:50:31,495
Your wife,

746
00:50:31,827 --> 00:50:32,954
your children?

747
00:50:39,882 --> 00:50:41,619
You must drink from me.

748
00:50:48,259 --> 00:50:49,429
Take me in you.

749
00:50:50,312 --> 00:50:51,627
Feel me in you.

750
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:56,126
We are together William,
forever.

751
00:50:57,101 --> 00:50:58,011
You...

752
00:50:58,574 --> 00:50:59,693
are mine.

753
00:51:18,731 --> 00:51:19,741
Look.

754
00:51:22,494 --> 00:51:24,330
You know you can never enter.

755
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,080
Do you wish to see them grow old?

756
00:51:30,947 --> 00:51:33,084
Grow feeble and die,

757
00:51:34,443 --> 00:51:37,190
while you remain the same
year after year?

758
00:51:38,238 --> 00:51:39,757
They are my family.

759
00:51:40,117 --> 00:51:41,793
They are as good as dead

760
00:51:42,695 --> 00:51:45,267
if they are found
harboring a vampire.

761
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,829
I've brought you here,

762
00:51:52,802 --> 00:51:55,315
and now it's time for us to go.

763
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:00,847
Come.

764
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,957
You've got to be kidding me.

765
00:52:44,959 --> 00:52:46,333
This is Randi Sue.

766
00:52:47,593 --> 00:52:50,411
Come join us. It's beautiful.

767
00:52:53,463 --> 00:52:54,905
Fuck you, Stackhouse.

768
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,749
Bitch!

769
00:52:57,338 --> 00:52:59,036
Don't fuck with my hair.

770
00:53:01,258 --> 00:53:03,701
Don't you dare stop.
